33,1," The evidence indicated that the BGA program's operation insofar as royalty collection was concerned did not operate any 
differently when the propagator-distributor was Yoder."
33,2," In some ways, the GRA program provided a service to growers. Normally, a grower would not have the facilities to test a 
mutation or sport that he found on a chrysanthemum plant to see if, indeed, a new variety that could be asexually reproduced 
had been discovered. By taking advantage of Yoder's extensive facilities for this work, both parties benefited - Yoder had "
34,," another new variety on which it was receiving royalties, and the grower had the benefit of half the royalties paid for his acuteness 
of observation in finding the new variety. Persons who wished to have access to the Yoder service, however, had to sign GRA 
agreements, which contained restrictions on use of varieties accepted by Yoder similar to those in the BGA agreement. "
35,3," Yoder's unfair competition claims and Cal-Florida's price discrimination and trade disparagement claims were withdrawn during 
the trial. "
36,4," The court's judgment of August 29, 1974, orders that Yoder recover $42,712.44 from CFPC for infringement of the plant 
patents Deep Conquest, Morocco, Mountain Snow, Mountain Sun, Promenade, Red Torch, and Southern Gold. The remaining 
$24,205.20 was to come from CFPCF for infringement of the latter six plant patents plus Gold Marble. "
38,5," One major failing of both proposed tests is the confusion of the standing inquiry with the substantive issues of causation and 
fact of damage. Cf. Areeda, Antitrust Violations Without Damage Recoveries, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1127, 1133-34 & n. 36 (1976) 
(comparing analyses under standing and damage doctrines)."
38,6," HN5[
] We do not believe that ultimate proof of injury in fact is a necessary requirement for standing. See 481 F.2d at 129 n."
38,11," . Cal-Florida's allegations are sufficient to establish injury in fact, to the extent that such a prerequisite exists for antitrust 
standing."
38,7," Yoder does not allege that Cal-Florida's claimed injuries were not to its business or property as required by section 4. Cf.  
Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 1972, 405 U.S. 251, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184. "
39,8," Because we have found standing under the stricter requirements of section 4 (treble damages), we necessarily have decided 
that standing could have been sustained under the more lenient criteria of section 16, 15 U.S.C. § 26 (injunctive relief). See 
Tugboat, Inc. v. Mobile Towing Co., supra, 534 F.2d at 1174, 1178 n. 12."
39,9," The 1974 Amendment to the Clayton Act recodified Section 5(b) at 15 U.S.C. § 16(i). Pub.L. 93-528, 88 Stat. 1706. Formerly, § 
5(b) appeared at 15 U.S.C. § 16(b). The amendment to the statute added procedures whereby the Attorney General would take 
into account the public interest before approving a consent decree, but it made no change in the tolling provision of the statute of 
limitations. "
40,10," The fact that Cal-Florida sought to intervene in the consent decree proceedings is irrelevant for our purposes. We assume for 
the purposes of this discussion that Cal-Florida, whose motion to intervene in the consent proceedings was denied on the same 
day as the consent decree was entered, would have been able to take advantage of the full sixty day period available to a party 
to the decree. We note, however, that its standing to challenge the provisions of the decree on appeal would have been 
questionable. See Utility Contractors Ass'n of New Jersey, Inc. v. Toops, 3 Cir. 1974, 507 F.2d 83. In fact, neither CFPC nor 
CFPCF attempted to appeal either from the denial of intervention or from the provisions of the consent decree itself."
40,11," The court noted that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a) prescribes the formalities to be followed in the imposition of 
sentence.  Rule 32(b)(1) sets out the procedures to be utilized in the entry of a final enforcible judgment of conviction. The court 
also observed that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 55 refers to the date that judgment is entered as one of the records that 
must be kept by the clerk. "
41,12," We do not reach the precise question that was before the Russ Togs court, since we believe the two cases to be 
distinguishable. Nevertheless, we do note that the policies underlying the finality of judgments seem to run in a direction contrary 
to that court's result. We express no opinion on the ultimate resolution of the competing considerations of finality of judgments 
and liberal access to Government proceedings for private litigants; we simply stress that we are not faced with that case. "
42,13," Category one involved a horizontal combination among traders at one level of distribution designed to exclude direct 
competitors from the market.  467 F.2d at 186. Category two was somewhat broader, involving vertical combinations among 
traders designed to exclude from the market direct competitors of some members of the combination. Id. "
43,14," Yoder's argument that the true purpose of BGA was to foster the creation of new varieties of ornamental plants is analogous to 
FOGA's argument that its mission was to help the original fashion designers and to protect the industry from style pirates. 
Neither justification is relevant if the exclusionary or coercive elements in the program are so central that it could not exist 
without them."
43,15," The fact that BGA varieties could be obtained outside the program by methods such as purchasing mother stock at a retail 
florist does not save the program. The record contains ample evidence of Yoder's efforts to stop such practices. Its use of 
friendly persuasion instead of a club does not lessen the coercive aspects of the program itself."
43,16," We reject Yoder's suggested analogy to trade secret law, claiming that the plant's genetic code is the secret. In one sense, the 
genetic code always remains a secret, even to the breeder. In the more common sense, however, as soon as the plant is 
released, so are its secrets. We prefer the latter view as the one more in accordance with experience. "
44,17, That the geographic market was nationwide was not disputed.
44,18," Section 2 provides in pertinent part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce . . . [shall be guilty of an offense]."
44,15, U.S.C. § 2.
44,19," We agree with Cal-Florida that the district court would have been mistaken to apply a rigid rule requiring 50% of the market for 
a monopolization offense without regard to any other factors. See Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., supra. If the court's 
directed verdict was correct on another ground, however, his reasons for so ruling would be immaterial. We have therefore 
structured our own discussion according to the issue we perceive: was the market all ornamental plants or could it have been 
chrysanthemums only? "
45,20," This alternative appears to come closest to the issue stated in the pretrial stipulation, which specified commerce in the 
propagation and sale of chrysanthemum cuttings. For the purposes of this discussion, however, we are willing to consider either 
chrysanthemums grown or cuttings taken and sold. "
47,21," We note that this theory looks to the horizontal competition between Cal-Florida and Yoder in their capacities as propagator-
distributors. "
48,22, Cal-Florida's computation went as follows:
48,1, . Yoder average selling price (YASP) = Yoder Sales (Dollars) / Number of Cuttings Sold
48,2, . CFPC/CFPCF average selling price (CFSP) = CFPC/CFPCF Sales (Dollars) / Number of Cuttings Sold
48,3," . Net ""Loss"" per cutting = YASP - CFSP for 1969 and 1970 figures. 1971-73 simply uses Yoder's 1970 figure."
48,4," . Net Loss X Total CFPC/CFPCF cuttings sold = Lost Profit Translated into one equation, we have (CFPC/CFPCF) (Total Cuttings Sold) X (Yoder Sales Income / (Yoder Cuttings - 
CFPC/CFPCF Sales Income) / CFPC/CFPCF Cuttings) = Damages. If the equation is multiplied out, we have Yoder Sales Income X CFPC/CFPCF cuttings) / (Yoder cuttings) - CFPC/CFPCF Sales 
Income = Damages (i.e. difference in adjusted sales income) Thus, the only thing that has been compared by these exhibits is the sales income of the two companies."
48,23," Jack Neckar of Cal-Florida also testified that the BGA royalty was a constraint on pricing to the grower, apparently referring to 
the danger that growers might turn to self-propagation. Yoder, however, faced the same limitation to the same degree in its 
capacity as a propagator-distributor. It is therefore difficult to see how the presence of self-propagators injured competitive 
relations between Yoder and Cal-Florida. "
49,24," The standard of proof needed to establish fact of damage is significantly different than that for amount of damage. The 
Supreme Court first described the difference between the two elements in Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Paper Co., 1931, 
282 U.S. 555, 562, 51 S. Ct. 248, 250, 75 L. Ed. 544, 548: It is true that there was uncertainty as to the extent of the damage, but there was none as to the fact of damage; and there 
is a clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that petitioner had sustained some 
damage and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount. The rule which precludes the recovery of 
uncertain damages applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to those damages which are definitely 
attributable to the wrong and only uncertain in respect of their amount. From this, the courts have inferred that a stricter standard of proof is necessary for fact of damage than for amount of damage. 
See Greene v. General Foods Corp., 5 Cir. 1975, 517 F.2d 635, 660, cert. denied, 1976, 424 U.S. 942, 96 S. Ct. 1409, 47 L. Ed. 
2d 348; Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 5 Cir. 1975, 506 F.2d 934, 953, reh. denied, 509 F.2d 758; Terrell v. 
Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, 5 Cir., 494 F.2d 16, 20, cert. dism'd, 1974, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 246, 42 L. Ed. 2d 260. 
See generally Areeda, supra note 5, Reasoner and Carter, Antitrust Developments in the Fifth Circuit - October 1974 Term, 29 
Southwestern L.J. 801, 817-23 (1975). Since our inquiry is directed to fact of damage and causation elements rather than to 
amount, we are governed by the higher standard of proof."
49,25," Ascertaining what constitutes ""substantial evidence"" can be difficult. For amount of damages, the standard is probably 
satisfied by reasonable estimates and indirect proof. See Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., supra, Terrell 
v. Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, supra. In contrast, for fact of damage and causation, we infer from Story Parchment and 
Bigelow, supra, that ""substantial evidence"" would be less speculative and uncertain. A number of recent decisions in this Circuit have addressed this problem.  In Shumate & Co. v. National Ass'n of Securities 
Dealers, Inc., supra, this Court held that Shumate's own testimony regarding his damages, unsupported by any relevant data, 
was insufficient to create a jury question on fact of injury.  In Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v. Instrumentation Laboratory, Inc., 
supra, conclusory testimony and generalized allegations from plaintiffs' corporate officers and one of plaintiffs' competitors to the 
effect that defendant's practices caused losses to plaintiffs, supported by citation of only one loss of business on a specific 
contract and only one vague opinion that the defendants' price discounting practice made it more difficult to compete, were 
insufficient to go to the jury.  Finally, neither fact of injury nor causation was proved adequately in Kestenbaum v. Falstaff "
50,," Brewing Corp., 5 Cir. 1975, 514 F.2d 690, cert.  denied, 1976, 424 U.S. 943, 96 S. Ct. 1412, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, and M.C.  Mfg.  
Co. v. Texas Foundries, Inc., 5 Cir. 1975, 517 F.2d 1059, cert.  denied, 1976, 424 U.S. 968, 96 S. Ct. 1466, 47 L. Ed. 2d 736. With regard to the kind of evidence that would be material, the M.C.  Mfg.  court, in rejecting plaintiff's contention that it too 
should have enjoyed a predatorily low price for a component part, offered several comments relevant to the case before us: The avowed purpose of the Sherman Act is the preservation of the open, competitive market. . . . Damages are recoverable 
only upon a showing that absent the anticompetitive practice plaintiff would not have suffered the loss."
50,517," F.2d at 1064. Antitrust plaintiffs are not entitled to the utter elimination of competition or competitors. Thus, they cannot 
prove fact of injury by pointing only to the effects of normal competition. Rather, they must prove that the actions in violation of 
the antitrust laws were a material factor in causing the injuries complained of. See generally Areeda, supra note 5."
50,26," Yoder also advances a variety of complaints concerning the instructions on passing on actually given to the jury which we do 
not reach. "
52,27," Some courts had held that the remote purchaser would not have standing unless he could prove that the overcharge was 
passed on to him under something analogous to a cost plus contract, turning Hanover Shoe on its head.  E.g.  Albertson's, Inc. 
v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., D.Utah 1973, 62 F.R.D. 43, modified on other grounds, 503 F.2d 459; Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. 
American Radiator & Std. Sanitary Corp., E.D.Pa.1970, 50 F.R.D. 13, aff'd sub nom.  Mangano v. American Radiator & Std. 
Sanitary Corp., 438 F.2d 1187. Fortunately for the jurisprudence, the Liquid Asphalt court recognized that the policies underlying 
Hanover Shoe required a different approach if the question was plaintiff's access to a forum instead of defeating a treble 
damage award. See Comment, Standing to Sue in Antitrust Cases: The Offensive Use of Passing-On, 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 976 
(1975)."
52,28," A few observations here are in order. We have been careful to describe the overcharge as one affecting Cal-Florida's sales 
price to its customers, rather than as a cost in Cal-Florida's business in the same sense as fertilizer was a cost. The fact that the 
alleged overcharge was denominated a royalty is not enough to negate the possibility of overcharge. "
54,29," Even if the comparative price data had not been fatally defective, we note that the amount of the jury's verdict might have 
required a remand in any event. Cal-Florida suggests that the jury arrived at its figure by taking the total royalties paid by both 
companies, rounding that amount up to $ 258,000, deciding that damages were one-half that amount, and giving each company 
$ 64,000 prior to the court's trebling. Several problems exist with this explanation: for example, no evidence of a ""reasonable"" 
royalty amount was introduced, thus casting doubt on the jury's license to split the royalties in half; and Cal-Florida of Florida 
paid only $ 42,306.47 in royalties, which leaves $ 22,193.53 of its award unaccounted for unless the two companies are treated 
as one."
54,30," An eighth plant patent, Deep Conquest, was found valid and infringed by the jury. Cal-Florida's only point regarding that patent 
goes to the court's trebling of the damages for infringement. See Part IV. E., infra."
54,31," The U.S. Plant Patent numbers for those varieties were as follows: Red Torch, U.S. Plant Patent 3,263; Gold Marble, U.S. 
Plant Patent 3,220; Morocco, U.S. Plant Patent 3,191; Promenade, U.S. Plant Patent 3,221; Southern Gold, U.S. Plant Patent 
3,257; Mountain Snow, U.S. Plant Patent 3,215; Mountain Sun, U.S. Plant Patent 3,250. "
55,32," The only express provision modifying the applicability of the invention patent statutes for plant patents is contained in 35 
U.S.C. § 162, which says that no plant patent will be invalidated for noncompliance with § 112 (description) if the description is 
as complete as is reasonably possible. No description issue is before us."
55,33," These factors are taken from 35 U.S.C. § 101 (""any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, 
or . . .  improvement thereof"") and 35 U.S.C. § 103 (""the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the 
prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would [not] have been obvious"")."
55,34," In order for a plant to have ""existed"" before in nature, we think that it must have been capable of reproducing itself. Thus, we 
have concluded that the mere fact that a sport of a plant had appeared in the past would not be sufficient to preclude the 
patentability of the plant on novelty grounds, since each sport is a one-time phenomenon absent human intervention. See in this 
connection the discussion on validity, at IV.C., infra. "
57,35," We suspect that part of our problem in applying patent concepts to the facts before us lies in the fact that we are dealing with 
ornamental plants. Beauty for its own sake is not often a goal of inventors - indeed, even ornamental plant breeders might be 
more aptly described as seekers of beauty for profit. Nevertheless, the statute does not exempt ornamental plants, and so we 
are bound to treat them on a par with more ""useful"" botanical creations."
57,36," Lest the reader fear that Congress neglected to make adequate provision for reproduction of the sexual type, we hasten to 
note that the Plant Variety Protection statute, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2321-2583, applies only to sexually reproducing plants."
57,37," Whether he might also be entitled to a patent on his plant is more problematic, although we would not want to rule out the 
possibility. "
58,38," Yoder also argues that the pretrial stipulation did not include obviousness as an issue to be tried, and that we should ignore it 
for that reason. We prefer not to take that approach: while ""invention"" or obviousness was not explicitly listed as an issue, it was 
implicit in several issues. Furthermore, it was discussed thoroughly by the district court and counsel for both parties. "
59,39," In this discussion, we are concerned only with the ""invention"" or obviousness issue. As we have defined novelty, supra, the 
recurrence of a sport of a particular color would be irrelevant. Similarly, sport recurrence says nothing about the new plant's 
particular characteristics.  The testimony at the trial amply established that Yoder's patented chrysanthemums were distinct to 
those skilled in the field - i.e. those in the breeding business. We note that there is a distinction between looking to the opinion of 
persons in the industry to prove a feature of patentability and relying on commercial success to prove nonobviousness.  Yoder's 
arguments relied on the former kind of evidence."
59,40," We do not regard this argument as one attacking the constitutionality of the Plant Patent Act; rather, it simply inquires how 
broadly the Act can be read consistent with the Constitution. "
61,41," For ease of reference, the footnotes in the dissent follow consecutively those of the Court."
61,42," I fully approve the Court's construction of our opinion in Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 203, 
which in language looser than needed, discussed this in terms of 50% plus. That would be bad law, but worse bad economics. In 
non- § 2 Sherman Act but highly analogous antitrust situations, 14% and 34-36% of the relevant markets have been sufficient for 
anti-competitive purposes.  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, et al., 1963, 374 U.S. 321, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 
915; compare United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 1967, 386 U.S. 361, 87 S. Ct. 1088, 18 L. Ed. 2d 151, with 
United States v. Provident National Bank, E.D.Pa., 1968, 280 F. Supp. 1. "
62,43," I acknowledge, of course, that CFPC and CFPCF did, soto voce, urge the ornamental flower relevant market theory."
62,44, The Court recognizes this (see p. 1351):

63,45," The Court points out that Yoder's share of chrysanthemum cuttings went from 61.4% in 1969 to 58.1% in 1972 (see note 20, 
supra and appended text)."
63,46," C. Ferguson, Microeconomic Theory, at 28, 113-15 (Rev. ed. 1969). "
64,47," See generally R. Posner, An Economic Analysis of Law, at 124-27 (1974); see also R. Posner, Antitrust Cases, Economic 
Notes and Other Materials, at 612-18 (1974)."
64,48," I can't resist the temptation to express a regret that having gone all the way through an extended evidentiary jury trial the Trial 
Court did not submit this issue to the jury under appropriate general instructions and a special verdict. F.R.Civ.P. 49(a).  Jamison 
Co., Inc. v. Westvaco, Corp., 5 Cir., 1976, 526 F.2d 922, reh. denied, 530 F.2d 34. Then we could have disposed of the issue 
once and for all, without - assuming I am right and the Court wrong - a new trial on substantially the same evidence. This comment goes also to the Trial Judge's failure to use, as he did with respect to some issues - an alternative 49(a) special 
issue submission on the two ""fact of damage"" theories, one of which we find to be faulty but which in the inscrutable mystery of a 
general verdict may have infected an otherwise sustainable dollar damage award. Now all agree that this must go back for a 
limited retrial wending its way between what we have said, what we have not said and what perhaps we meant to say. "
78,1," OMI also contends that the Ohio anti-trust laws, Sections 1331.01-1331.15, 1331.99, Ohio Revised Code, regulate the 
business of insurance and therefore entitle it to a McCarron-Ferguson Act exemption.The Court assumes that the Ohio antitrust "
79,," laws are applicable to insurance companies.   State v. Ross, 16 Ohio Dec. 704 (C.P. Ct. 1906). Although there is evidence to the 
contrary, see, e.g.,  Proctor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, supra 31;  Steingart v. Equitable Life 
Assurance, 366 F. Supp. 790, 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1973);  Sanborn v. Palm, 336 F. Supp. 222, 228 (S.D. Tex. 1971), State antitrust 
statutes are antitrust regulation and not insurance regulation.  Fry v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, 355 F. 
Supp. 1151, 1153 (N.D. Tex. 1973). See also,  American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus v. Planned Marketing 
Associates, Inc., 389 F. Supp. 1141, 1147 (E.D. Va. 1974). The Court concludes that the Ohio antitrust laws are not the 
regulation of ""the business of insurance."""
79,2," Plaintiff makes various other arguments that OSMA's price fixing activities affect interstate commerce. The Court does not now 
rule on those allegations.  The effect discussed in the body of the opinion is sufficient to dispose of the issue on summary 
judgment. "
80,3," Part of OSMA's argument is that it did not ""acquire"" OMI within the meaning of § 7 of the Clayton Act because OMI is a wholly 
owned subsidiary which was formed by OSMA in 1945.  The Court reserves ruling on this aspect of the motion. "
81,1," This case was originally decided by an unpublished order. The court has decided to publish, in the form of this per curiam 
opinion, the portions of that order germane to the issue of the effect of the covenant not to sue relied upon by United States 
Gypsum Company. Certain changes in form but none of substance have been made in the portions published. The rest of the 
order remains subject to Circuit Rule 35. "
82,2," Richard's also alleged that USG guaranteed and thus made possible a $200,000 loan to K & B and maintained compensating 
balances in at least two banks for the benefit of K & B as part of the consideration for entering into the agreement. "
83,3," Plaintiff also alleged that the arrangement constituted a tying arrangement and an attempt to monopolize, but these theories 
have been abandoned. "
88,1," See von Mehren, ""The Antitrust Laws and Regulated Industries: The Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction"", 67 Harvard Law Review 
929, 932 (1954); Schwartz, ""Legal Restrictions of Competition on the Regulated Industries: An Abdiction of Judicial 
Responsibility"", 67 Harvard Law Review 436, 646 (1964); Stokes, ""A Few Irreverent Comments About Antitrust, Agency 
Regulation, and Primary Jurisdiction"", 33 G. Washington Law Review 529, 551 (1964); Jaffe, ""Primary Jurisdiction"", 77 Harvard 
Law Review 1037, 1042 (1964). "
97,1," The only jury demand by Tek-Bearing in its answer to the amended complaint was under the New Jersey Antitrust Act, and was 
presumably addressed to the conspiracy allegation.  Federal cases under the Sherman Antitrust Act apparently allow a trial by 
jury under federal procedures, even though not provided for by statute, irrespective of whether the cause of action existed at 
common law.  See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S. Ct. 948, 3 L. Ed. 2d 988 (1959). But compare 
Davis v. Marathon Oil Co., 57 F.R.D. 23 (N.D. Ohio 1972), where Judge Young reviewed the law and made a strong argument 
that juries should not be required in such cases.  Indeed, summary judgment motions appear to be treated somewhat differently 
under the federal cases because of the complexity of antitrust cases.  Compare Mogul v. General Motors Corp., 391 F. Supp. 
1305, 1307 (E.D. Pa. 1975), aff'd 527 F. 2d 645 (3 Cir. 1976), with Schwing Motor Co. v. Hudson Sales Corp., 138 F. Supp. 899, 
890 (D. Md. 1956), aff'd 239 F. 2d 176 (4 Cir. 1956), cert. den.  355 U.S. 823, 78 S. Ct. 30, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1957). "
100,2," Because of the failure of plaintiff's proofs the court need not determine whether Borg-Warner had just cause to terminate the 
distributorship because of reasons such as failure to maintain adequate stock, continual difficulties with payments and engaging 
in another business to the detriment of the distributorship."
100,3, 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1 and 2. 
102,4," Plaintiff's proofs were that one distributor was to be eliminated from the northern New Jersey area upon establishment of the 
new distributorship although plaintiff argued it was supposed to be or should have been other than it. "
103,5, The proofs referred to were offered and/or admitted only against Borg-Warner since the conspiracy had not been established.
103,6," Indeed, a persuasive argument might be made as to the advantages of a product manufacturer encouraging equipment 
manufacturers to incorporate the former's product in equipment manufactured by them, with possible resultant benefits even to 
distributors. "
110,1," The Rozelle Rule essentially provides that when a player's contractual obligation to a team expires and he signs with a different 
club, the signing club must provide compensation to the player's former team. If the two clubs are unable to conclude mutually 
satisfactory arrangements, the Commissioner may award compensation in the form of one or more players and/or draft choices 
as he deems fair and equitable."
110,2," The suit was initiated by 36 players as a class action; however, the class action allegations were later withdrawn.  At the 
commencement of trial, there remained 16 of the original plaintiffs. Six of them, Kermit Alexander, Kenneth Bowman, William "
111,," Curry, Thomas Keating, John Mackey and Alan Page, sought only injunctive relief under Count I of the complaint.  The 
remaining 10, Ocie Austin, Marlin Briscoe, Daniel Connors, Richard F. Gordon, John Henderson, Clint Jones, Gene Washington, 
Charles West, John Williams and Nate Wright, sought both injunctive relief and damages under Count II. Connors later withdrew 
his claim."
111,3, The district court's opinion is reported at 407 F. Supp. 1000 (D. Minn. 1975).
111,4, Trial on the issue of damages was deferred pending the disposition of this appeal. 
112,5," Paragraph 10 of the Standard Player Contract contains the following option clause: The Club may, by sending notice in writing to the Player, on or before the first day of May following the football season 
referred to in P 1 hereof, renew this contract for a further term of one (1) year on the same terms as are provided by this 
contract, except that (1) the Club may fix the rate of compensation to be paid by the Club to the Player during said further 
term, which rate of compensation shall not be less than ninety percent (90%) of the sum set forth in P 3 hereof and shall be 
payable in installments during the football season in such further term as provided in P 3; and (2) after such renewal this 
contract shall not include a further option to the Club to renew the contract.  The phrase ""rate of compensation"" as above 
used shall not include bonus payments or payments of any nature whatsoever and shall be limited to the precise sum set 
forth in P 3 hereof."
112,6," The NFL has adopted a number of other rules and practices designed to maintain competitive balance and protect the clubs' 
investment in player development costs which are not at issue here.  Among them are the option clause and Standard Player 
Contract, discussed above, the college draft and no-tampering rules.  The operation and effect of these provisions are discussed 
in the district court's opinion, supra, 407 F. Supp. at 1005-06. See also Smith v. Pro-Football, 420 F. Supp. 738 (D.D.C. 1976); 
Kapp v. National Football League, 390 F. Supp. 73 (N.D. Cal. 1974). Our determination here is not to be taken as indicative of 
our views on the validity of these other provisions."
112,7, This figure includes four players whose contracts expired for reasons other than playing out their options.
112,8," The players involved in those instances were Pat Fischer, Dave Parks, Phil Olsen and Dick Gordon.  The circumstances of 
these cases are detailed in the district court's opinion, supra, 407 F. Supp. at 1004-05. "
113,9," As the Supreme Court stated in Connell Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, at 622, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 
(1975),: ""the nonstatutory exemption has its source in the strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate 
competition over wages and working conditions."""
113,10," As stated by the Third Circuit in Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco Corp., 494 F.2d 840 (1974), at 847 n. 14: We reject Scooper Dooper's contention that the labor exemption is unavailable to employers.  Such a proposition would 
undermine the vitality of the exemption by discouraging bargaining on the part of management.  To preserve the integrity of 
the negotiating process, employers who bargain in good faith must be entitled to claim the antitrust exemption. See 
Philadelphia World Hockey Club, Inc. v. Philadelphia Hockey Club, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 462, 499 (E.D. Pa. 1972). "
115,11," Connell Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, supra; Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. 676, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596

325 U.S. 797, 65 S. Ct. 1533, 89 L. Ed. 1939 (1945). The facts and holdings in these cases have been set forth at length 
elsewhere and need not be reiterated here.  See e.g., Bodine Produce, Inc. v. United Farm Workers Organizing Comm., 494 
F.2d 541, 544-56 (9th Cir. 1974); Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n., 389 F. Supp. 867, 884-89 (S.D. N.Y. 1975). For a 
thorough analysis of these cases and the labor exemption in general, see Siegel, Connolly & Walker, The Antitrust Exemption 
for Labor-Magna Carta or Carte Blanche?, 13 Duquesne L.Rev. 411 (1975); Meltzer, Labor Unions, Collective Bargaining, and 
the Antitrust Laws, 32 U. Chi. L. Rev. 659 (1965); Comment, Labor's Antitrust Exemption After Pennington and Jewel Tea, 66 
Colum. L. Rev. 742 (1966)."
115,12," A similar observation was made by Justice Marshall in his dissenting opinion in Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 288, 32 L. Ed. 2d 
728, 92 S. Ct. 2099 (1972).In reference to a contention asserted by major league baseball club owners that baseball's reserve 
system was incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement and was therefore immune from antitrust scrutiny, Justice 
Marshall stated at 294: This Court has faced the interrelationship between the antitrust laws and the labor laws before.  The decisions make 
several things clear.  First, ""benefits to organized labor cannot be utilized as a cat's-paw to pull employer's chestnuts out of 
the antitrust fires."" United States v. Women's Sportswear Manufacturers Assn., 336 U.S. 460, 464 [93 L. Ed. 805, 69 S. Ct. 
714] (1949). See also Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, 325 U.S. 797 [89 L. Ed. 1939, 65 S. Ct. 1533] (1945). 
Second, the very nature of a collective-bargaining agreement mandates that the parties be able to ""restrain"" trade to a 
greater degree than management could do unilaterally. United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219 [85 L. Ed. 788, 61 S. Ct. 
463] (1941); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 [14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585] (1965); Amalgamated 
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. 676 [14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596] (1965); cf., Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 
283 [3 L. Ed. 2d 312, 79 S. Ct. 297] (1959). Finally, it is clear that some cases can be resolved only by examining the 
purposes and the competing interests of the labor and antitrust statutes and by striking a balance. It is apparent that none of the prior cases is precisely in point.  They involve union-management agreements that work to 
the detriment of management's competitors.  In this case, petitioner urges that the reserve system works to the detriment of 
labor."
115,13," In Connell, the Court observed: Here Local 100, by agreement with several contractors, made nonunion subcontractors ineligible to compete for a portion of 
the available work.  This kind of direct restraint on the business market has substantial anticompetitive effects, both actual 
and potential, that would not follow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working conditions.  It "
116,," contravenes antitrust policies to a degree not justified by congressional labor policy, and therefore cannot claim a 
nonstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws. There can be no argument in this case, whatever its force in other contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude might be 
entitled to an antitrust exemption if it were included in a lawful collective-bargaining agreement. Cf.  Mine Workers v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. at 664-665; Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. at 689-690 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 709-713, 732-733 (opinion 
of Goldberg, J.)."
116,421, U.S. at 625-26 (emphasis added).
116,14," In a concurring and dissenting opinion in Jewel Tea and Pennington, 381 U.S. at 697, Justice Goldberg, joined by Justices 
Harlan and Stewart, suggested that all collective bargaining activity on mandatory subjects of bargaining be deemed exempt 
from the coverage of the antitrust laws. That test, however, has never been adopted by a majority of the Supreme Court.  
Rather, a majority of the Court seems to favor an accommodation less heavily weighted in favor of labor policy."
116,15," As stated in Jewel Tea, supra: Thus the issue in this case is whether the . . . restriction . . . is so intimately related to wages, hours and working conditions 
that the unions' successful attempt to obtain that provision through bona fide, arm's-length bargaining in pursuit of their own 
labor union policies, and not at the behest of or in combination with nonlabor groups, falls within the protection of the 
national labor policy and is therefore exempt from the Sherman Act. "
116,381, U.S. at 689-90.
116,16," At trial, appellants contended that this issue should be decided in the first instance by the NLRB under the doctrine of primary 
jurisdiction.  We find no merit to this claim for the reasons relied on by Justice White in rejecting a similar contention in Meat 
Cutters v. Jewel Tea, supra, 381 U.S. at 684-88. "
117,17," Appellants' quid pro quo argument rests primarily on the following testimony of Alan Miller, a bargaining representative of the 
players, concerning the 1970 negotiations: There were times when I personally can recall, for example, one point when the NFL owners were taking the position that 
the NFL players must bargain their individual salaries collectively, for example, all quarterbacks are here to here, all tight 
ends are here to here, the flankers are making so much, a bonus for anything over three touchdowns, et cetera, et cetera. I remember specifically at that point telling somebody that if that's the way they wanted to bargain that we would, you know, 
consider making the Rozelle Rule and the abolishment of that rule a direct issue in the negotiations, that's the only 
recollection I have of that actually coming up; in itself it was not a major topic of discussion. We cannot agree that this testimony is indicative of a quid pro quo. First, the colloquy related by Miller seems to have been a 
side discussion rather than a focal point of the negotiations. Second, at the time this interchange occurred, the clubs had already 
agreed to individual salary negotiations in a separate agreement. "
118,18," In view of our holding, we need not decide whether the effect of an agreement extends beyond its formal expiration date for 
purposes of the labor exemption."
118,19," It is undisputed that the NFL operates in interstate commerce.  It is also recognized that the business of professional football 
enjoys no special exemption from the antitrust laws. See Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456, 
77 S. Ct. 390 (1957)."
118,20," See e.g., Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274, 52 L. Ed. 488, 28 S. Ct. 301 (1908). "
119,21," Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1940), concerned a lengthy and violent union strike 
which impeded the flow of the employer's goods into interstate commerce.  The Court found no antitrust violation."
119,22," In Cordova v. Bache & Co., 321 F. Supp. 600 (S.D. N.Y. 1970), securities representatives had alleged a conspiracy among 
their stock broker-employers to reduce the commissions paid to them.  Judge Mansfield stated at 606: It is readily apparent that Congress, in enacting § 6, was concerned with the right of labor and similar organizations to 
continue engaging in such activities, including the right to strike, not with the right of employers to band together for joint 
action in fixing the wages to be paid by each employer.  There is no evidence of the existence of any necessity to protect 
the latter type of activity at the time when § 6 was enacted.  It seems clear that if Congress had wanted to exempt 
agreements between employers as to the money or compensation that would be paid to their employees, it would not have 
limited § 6 to exemption of ""the labor of a human being"" which can be restrained only by the employees or unions 
controlling the labor itself.  Congress would also have provided that compensation offered or paid by employers to 
employees is not a commodity or article of commerce.  This it did not do."
119,23," In Mandeville Farms v. Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 92 L. Ed. 1328, 68 S. Ct. 996 (1948), Mr. Justice Rutledge observed at 236: HN7[
] The statute does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers.  Nor 
does it immunize the outlawed acts because they are done by any of these.  Cf.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. 
Ct. 1125. The Act is comprehensive in its terms and coverage, protecting all who are made victims of the forbidden 
practices by whomever they may be perpetrated. "
120,24," See Timken Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 95 L. Ed. 1199, 71 S. Ct. 971 (1951). "
121,25," In Worthen Bank & Trust Co. v. National BankAmericard Inc., 485 F.2d 119 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 918, 39 L. 
Ed. 2d 473, 94 S. Ct. 1417 (1974), we reversed a grant of summary judgment based on a finding of a per se violation by a 
combination of banks operating a national bank credit card system.  This court recognized the need of the banks to join together 
to produce the product being sold, since it would be impossible for any of the member banks, acting alone, to issue a national 
bank credit card.  Thus, we found, inferentially at least, a justification for preserving the integrity of that productive capacity."
121,26," The Supreme Court stated in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, at 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958),: This principle of per se unreasonableness not only makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act 
more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and 
prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to 
determine at large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable -- an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when 
undertaken. "
122,27," Gordon himself testified that he was fined by the Chicago Bears for missing training camp and exhibition games even though 
he had played out his option with that club and was no longer under contract to them.  His testimony reflected that Los Angeles 
called Chicago to get the Bears' consent to have Gordon work out with the Rams so that Los Angeles management could 
observe his performance.  He further stated that he received indications from Cincinnati that Chicago's compensation requests 
were unreasonable; that ""they (Chicago) were asking almost for their (Cincinnati's) entire defensive line."" Gordon missed pre-
season camp and the first few games of the 1972 season because of Chicago's unreasonable requests under the player 
compensation rule.  He testified that this affected his physical condition and contributed to an injury that year."
122,28," Among other examples which support Judge Larson's findings are: Marlin Briscoe indicated that he had to sign a three-year contract with Miami even though he would have preferred a single-year 
contract.  He stated that ""they would not accept anything less than a three-year contract because of what they would have to 
give up. . . ."" Alan Page testified that the Rozelle Rule was a hindrance to free player movement, but that the principal effect is on players' 
salaries. Steven Falk, an attorney for Bob Hayes, testified that Dallas told the Redskins that ""they (Dallas) were not trading Hayes to 
anybody within their own division. . . . William Sullivan, President of the Patriots, said he didn't want to sign Joe Kapp, Minnesota's quarterback, and then take a 
chance on what Minnesota would demand. "
123,29," See note 6, supra."
123,30," Appellants contend that the district court's findings of fact in this regard are too conclusory and do not address a variety of 
questions pertinent to the issue of whether the Rozelle Rule is necessary to maintain competitive balance.  We perceive no merit 
to this contention.  The additional findings deemed necessary by appellants are largely subsidiary and redundant.  The court's 
findings are sufficient to disclose the basis for its decision.  See 5A Moore's Federal Practice P52.06[1], at 2710 (2d ed. 1975)."
123,31," The conclusion that the Rozelle Rule constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade was reached in Kapp v. National Football 
League, supra, even without the prolonged inquiry which has been undertaken in this case.  The court stated: We conclude that such a rule imposing restraint virtually unlimited in time and extent, goes far beyond any possible need 
for fair protection of the interests of the club-employers or the purposes of the NFL and that it imposes upon the player-
employees such undue hardship as to be an unreasonable restraint and such a rule is not susceptible of different 
inferences concerning its reasonableness; it is unreasonable under any legal test and there is no genuine issue about it to 
require or justify trial."
123,390, F. Supp. at 82. 
124,32," Judge Learned Hand stated, in the same case: Whatever other conduct the Acts may forbid, they certainly forbid all restraints of trade which were unlawful at common-law, 
and one of the oldest and best established of these is a contract which unreasonably forbids any one to practice his calling. Gardella v. Chandler, 172 F.2d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 1949). "

obvious that it would often be practically out of the question to apply the present principle by requiring the production of the

commerce"" theory. See Doctors, supra, at 50-51: We have made no attempt to judge the adequacy of every one of the plaintiff's allegations on the interstate commerce issue

190,5, Cephalosporins are: 
191,," . . . semisynthetic antibacterial agents that are closely related chemically to the penicillins and, like them, contain a beta 
lactam ring as part of the nucleus.  They are produced by the addition of substituent groups to 7-aminocephalosporanic 
acid, a chemical nucleus obtained from cephalosporin C, which is elaborated by the fungus Cephalosporium. The 
cephalosporins interfere with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall by inactivating a transpeptidase, thereby preventing 
cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains.  A.M.A. Drug Evaluations 523 (2d Ed. 1973)."
191,6," In calculating the base dividend, if a hospital takes its rebates from the previous quarter in the form of Lilly cephalosporins,

only in nonprofit hospitals.  Therefore, any mention of hospitals in this opinion refers to nonprofit institutions, unless otherwise 
indicated. "

212,17," The course of conduct from which the court inferred the existence of an illegal tying arrangement in Advance Business

machines in order to force customers to use only SCM supplies in electrostatic copying machines rented from SCM.  Advance 
Business Systems, supra, 415 F.2d at 64. SmithKline does not allege that such deceptive practices were used by Lilly in order to 
force the purchase of Kefzol in addition to Keflin and Keflex."
212,18," In Dunkin' Donuts the plaintiff withdrew a claim under section three of the Clayton Act after the parties agreed that the subject 
matter of the lawsuit was not within the meaning of the Clayton Act. Unlike Dunkin' Donuts, the actions complained of in this 
case fall squarely within the terms of section three of the Clayton Act and, therefore, the elements of proof of an illegal tie-in are 
stated in the alternative where necessary. The standards for finding an illegal tie-in differ under the Sherman Act and under the Clayton Act. The Clayton Act is broader in 
scope, for in finding that the plaintiff has satisfied its burden of proof with respect to the second or third elements set forth in the 
above text, a court must find that a violation of section three of the Clayton Act has been established.  In order to find that 
sections one and three of the Sherman Act have been violated, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has successfully 
obtained substantial economic power over the tying products and affected a not insubstantial amount of commerce through the 
sales at issue.  The Clayton Act, unlike the Sherman Act in this context, is concerned with possible rather than actual 
competitive effects.  Compare Fortner, supra, 394 U.S. at 501, 510-511, 514 n.9, with Times-Picayune, supra, 345 U.S. at 608-
611. Judge Fortas, in his dissenting opinion in Fortner, asserted that the majority opinion abolished the distinction in the "
213,," quantum of proof required under section 1 of the Sherman Act and section three of the Clayton Act. 394 U.S. at 521 (Fortas, J., 
dissenting). Despite the fact that there is some difference in the elements of proof required to establish a Clayton or Sherman Act violation, 
the first element of proof appearing in text, the nature of the agreement between the seller and the buyer, must be demonstrated 
under either Act in order to establish an illegal tie-in. My determination that SmithKline has not established an illegal tie-in is 
equally applicable to its claim under the Clayton and the Sherman Acts."
213,19," I am fully cognizant of the different circumstances which generated Dunkin' Donuts and the factual matrix of this case, but 
these differences do not seem to be controlling.  Dunkin' Donuts was a § 1292 interlocutory appeal from the district court's 
certification of a plaintiff class.  The plaintiffs challenged alleged tie-in sales made in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
The consolidated actions were brought by franchisees against their franchisor, Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc.  The court held 
that class certification was invalid; each franchisee was required to demonstrate that he was coerced individually to accept the 
alleged tie-in, so that common issues of law or fact did not predominate. In footnote 7a to the opinion, Judge Aldisert recognized the distinction between an action, whether private or governmental, 
brought by a franchisee against its franchisor, and an action between a franchisor and a competing supplier.  The court 
expressly refrained from commenting on the latter fact situation.  The nature of this suit between SmithKline and Lilly, one 
brought by a seller against its competitor, necessitated a different mode of proof than that appropriate in an action between a 
franchisee and a franchisor.  However, a difference in the modes of proof does not change the essential elements of a tying 
arrangement, the first of which is the forced purchase of a secondary, tied, product in order to acquire the desired, tying, product.  
The delineation of the coercion element in tie-in cases appearing in Dunkin' Donuts is persuasive authority for any decision in 
this case, and has broad ramifications beyond the adjudication of the franchisee dispute.  See 531 F.2d at 1221, n. 7a. "
214,20," The Court in Grinnell stated: We see no reason to differentiate between ""line"" of commerce in the context of [§ 7 of] the Clayton Act and ""part"" of 
commerce for purposes of [§ 2 of] the Sherman Act. 384 U.S. at 573. Therefore, in discussing the legal standards which control the determination of product market, both section two Sherman Act 
and section seven Clayton Act cases will be cited. "
216,21," See Text, supra, 1091, n.5."
216,22," Cephalosporins, unlike the penicillins, are effective in treating gram-negative as well as gram-positive infections (Defendant's 
Exhibit D-102(a); Plaintiff's Exhibits P-178, P-189).  Cephalosporins, unlike the tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and erythromycin-
like drugs, kill bacteria rather than merely inhibit its growth.  Cephalosporins are relatively non-or-less toxic than the 
aminoglycosides (Plaintiff's Exhibit P-178, at 3-4).  Finally, cephalosporins, particularly Keflin, are superior products for providing 
the broad coverage against bacteria which is deemed so essential in a program of therapy implemented by treating physicians 
(See Tr. 1074). "
217,23," Dr. Holloway, in the course of his testimony, acknowledged that his efforts to persuade physicians, of the merits of rational, 
cost-conscious drug therapy, were directed toward medical students.  He stated that by the time physicians complete medical 
school they have developed poor prescribing habits with the result that doctors prefer to prescribe ""new more exciting antibiotics 
. . . in their training period, cost never sinks through to them."" (Tr. 847-848).  Dr. Holloway also acknowledged that cephalosporin 
usage was a lower proportion (20%) of the drug budget of teaching hospitals, as compared with community hospitals (35%).  
However, teaching hospitals constitute less than ten percent of the 6,000 hospitals with which the Court is concerned in this 
case (Tr. 857-858). Mr. Step, President of the Pharmaceutical Division of Eli Lilly and Company acknowledged that there is a vast disparity between 
the counseling given by experts in the medical field and the practical approach of physicians.  One of Lilly's witnesses, Mr. 
Nudelman, urged that rational drug therapy necessitated the sensitivity testing of patients prior to treatment with any antibiotic. 
Mr. Nudelman argued that the use of cephalosporins as preventative therapy, prior to isolation of a particular infection in a 
patient, should be discouraged.  Mr. Step succinctly stated the reaction of practicing physicians to the suggestions of specialists 
such as Mr. Nudelman: There are those physicians who think that it is very poor medicine, that you ought not to treat until you've isolated an 
infection.  There are those physicians who say that's great for professors, but I treat people. . ..  I've got a patient that is sick 
. . . I'm worried about that patient and I would rather have given him a couple days of broad spectrum antibiotics that he 
didn't need than have not given him one that he did.  [Tr. 68-69.] Mr. Step, when questioned further, testified that Keflin was a very good drug for preventative therapy prior to the isolation of an 
infection -- a practice adopted by the majority of physicians, despite the counsel of ""eminent critics."" [Step, dep. 69.] "
218,24," In an effort to convince the Court that the relevant product market is the market for anti-infective drugs, Lilly, in its Post-Trial 
Memorandum, includes numerous references to SmithKline's internal marketing reports, wherein plaintiff's employees make 
specific mention of the anti-infective drug market.  However, upon careful examination of Lilly's internal marketing documents, 
the Court is singularly impressed with the untold references made to the cephalosporin and/or cefazolin market, without any 
mention of a broader anti-infective market.  Surely Lilly does not contend that reference to either the broad or the narrow product 
market in an internal marketing analysis is an admission of the relevant product market for antitrust purposes.  The Court must 
determine the relevant market in light of all the evidence produced at trial. "
223,25," I am fully aware of Dr. Weston's reputation as a prolific writer on economic matters.  In the past, some courts have found him 
to be ""eminently qualified"" and that his surveys were ""fair, representative, and adequate."" See U.S. v. Crocker-Anglo National 
Bank, 277 F. Supp. 133, 170-171 (N.D.Cal. 1967). On other occasions, agencies have rejected his core conclusions about 
relevant markets and prices.  See Litton Industries, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 793, 979, which reversed a hearing examiner who ""accredited 
great weight"" to Dr. Weston's testimony.  82 F.T.C. 888. Whatever may be his general reputation, in this instance I did not find 
his testimony credible as to his relevant market conclusion."
223,26," Step, Dep. at 33-36. "
224,27," Under the Revised CSP, few hospitals received an increase in dividend rates.  Defendant's Exhibit D-1119, at 16, clearly 
demonstrates this fact.  Only 29% of the hospitals were predicted to receive an increased dividend rate, whereas 66% were 
expected to experience a decrease in the applicable rate. 5% of the hospitals were predicted to remain at the same dividend 
level. "
225,28," In the course of their respective depositions, Mr. W. R. Hutchinson, Executive Vice President for Lilly's Pharmaceutical 
Division, and Mr. E.L. Step, President of that same division, acknowledged that the Revised CSP's rebate scheme had not, to 
their knowledge, been used by any United States drug company (Deposition of W. R. Hutchinson, 37-38; Deposition of E.L. 
Step, 11-12)."
225,29," Lilly asserts that a monopolist, who has legally acquired its power at the outset, must have ""some room to move . . . [when it]. . 
. sees. . . [it's]. . . market share acquired by research and technical innovations being eroded. . . ."" 510 F.2d at 927. Lilly, as 
indicated above, had several other competitive options which would have enabled it to compete with SmithKline for the cefazolin 
market without use of monopoly power. While Lilly has the right to compete, ""it is at least subject to the qualification that HN30[ ] a lawful end achieved by unlawful means is not protected from the antitrust laws."" See Coleman Motor Co., supra, 525 F.2d at 1347. Furthermore, if Lilly argues that invalidation of the Revised CSP merely saddles the market with an inefficient company 
(SmithKline) the proper response is also indicated in Judge Rosenn's opinion in Coleman Motor Co., namely that Lilly had 
""permissible options available to it"" which would have enabled it to compete with SmithKline without engaging in predatory 
practices.  Id. at 1348. "
230,1," This Court is, of course, aware of the caveat expressed time after time by the Supreme Court against the use of summary 
judgments in complex antitrust cases.  Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 
486 (1962); Norfolk Monument Co. v. Woodlawn Memorial Gardens, Inc., 394 U.S. 700, 22 L. Ed. 2d 658, 89 S. Ct. 1391 (1969). 
The Court has also cautioned that immunity from the federal antitrust laws should not be lightly implied.  United States v. 
Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 348, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963). However, HN2[
] summary judgment is an appropriate manner of resolving disputes concerning applications of the McCarran- Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1011 et seq., and courts have not been hesitant to apply it where appropriate.  See, e.g., Proctor v. 
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 406 F. Supp. 27 (D.D.C. 1975); Schwartz v. Commonwealth Land Title Insurance 
Co., 374 F. Supp. 564 (E.D. Pa. 1974) (subsequent proceedings reported at, 384 F. Supp. 302 (E.D. Pa. 1974). "
231,2," Section 9201 of the California Corporations Code provides: ""Health service organizations: Requirements: Supervision.  A nonprofit corporation may be formed under this part for the 
purposes of defraying or assuming the cost of professional services of licentiates under any chapter of Division 2 
(commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code or of rendering any such services, but it may not 
engage directly or indirectly in the performance of the corporate purposes or objects unless all of the following requirements 
are met: ""(a) At least one-fourth of all licentiates of the particular profession residing in California become members. ""(b) Membership in the corporation and an opportunity to render professional services upon a uniform basis are available 
to all licensed members of the particular profession. ""(c) Voting by proxy and cumulative voting are prohibited. ""(d) A certificate is issued to the corporation by the particular professional board whose licentiates have become members, 
finding compliance with the requirements of subdivisions (a), (b), and (c). ""Any such nonprofit corporation shall be subject to supervision by the particular professional board under which its 
members are licensed and shall also be subject to Section 9505."" "
232,3," The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1011 et seq., preserved federal jurisdiction over certain predatory conduct regardless 
of whether such activity is also subject to state regulation. Thus, Section 1013(b) of the Act provides: ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or 
intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" However, this boycott exception has been construed very narrowly to apply only to company ""blacklisting"" efforts.  Addrisi v. 
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., 503 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 929, 43 L. Ed. 2d 400, 95 S. 
Ct. 1129 (1975). Plaintiffs concede this provision is inapposite in this case. "
233,4," Certificate of Wesley J. Kinder, Insurance Commissioner of the State of California."
233,5," Plaintiffs' suggested approach was recently adopted in Pastor v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., CCH TRADE REGULATION 
REPORTS P 60,783 (C.D. Cal. 1976).  It involved an alleged conspiracy to restrain trade in medicine and physicians' liability 
insurance between the Los Angeles County Medical Association and certain insurance companies.  The court granted Hartford's 
motion to dismiss based on the McCarran-Ferguson Act (McCarran Act), ruling that the activities complained of were embraced 
within the state definition of insurance and were subject to state regulation. However, the court refused to dismiss the action as 
against the County Medical Association solely because it was not engaged in the business of insurance and the power of the 
state insurance commissioner did not extend to it.  The court stated: ""* * * The Court considers the proper definition of 'the business of insurance,' as that term is used in the McCarran-
Ferguson Act, is to be found by considering the particular plan to regulate insurance under the state statute where the 
question arises.  In other words, our question is whether the activities here complained of are within the reach of the 
regulatory provisions of the California Insurance Code.  What is regulated by that code is the business of insurance."" Id. at 
68,397. This Court declines to follow Pastor for several reasons.  First, as is discussed infra, the Court believes that the business of 
insurance should be defined by reference to federal, not state, law.  Moreover, the Los Angeles County Medical Association is 
distinct in organization and function from the defendant herein, a nonprofit health service organization.  Finally, the exemption 
provided in the McCarran Act is not strictly limited to insurance companies; it is the ""business of insurance"" with which the 
McCarran Act is concerned.  Thus, the focus must be on the nature of the conduct involved, not the status of the defendant 
under state law. Royal Drug Co. v. Group Life & Health Insurance Co., 415 F. Supp. 343 (W.D. Tex. 1976). "
234,6," Mitgang v. Western Title Insurance Co., CCH TRADE REGULATION REPORTS P 75,322 (N.D. Cal. 1974), further supports 
the proposition that the ""business of insurance"" is defined by reference to federal law.  There the court held that title insurance 
was ""insurance"" for McCarran-Ferguson Act purposes by applying federal standards.  The court noted that it was also ""of 
interest, although hardly dispositive"" that title insurance was regulated under the California Insurance Code.  Id. at 98,025."
234,7," Plaintiffs' definition of CDS' business, as set forth in the complaint, is: ""18.  Prepaid dental care plans are contracts between CDS, dental service corporations, or other providers of dental health

periodic premiums and consideration received by CDS or other providers from subscribing purchasers, CDS or other 
providers agree to pay certain professional fees and charges for dental care and services performed on and for designated 
patients."" Complaint, pp. 4-5. "
235,8," Page 2 of the affidavit of Guy F. Chetalat, filed in support of CDS' motion for summary judgment, indicates: ""The principal business of California Dental Service is to contract with government bodies, employer organizations and joint 
employer-labor trust funds to provide dental care benefits for members of groups in exchange for fixed, per capita, monthly 
premium payments by the contracting entity.  In entering into such contracts, CDS assumes the actuarial risk that the 
monthly, per capita premium payments by the contracting group will be sufficient to defray the costs of the benefits which 
CDS undertakes to provide.  It is my responsibility as actuary for CDS to estimate the expenses which CDS will incur in 
providing these benefits in order to arrive at an adequate premium rate to cover these expenses. ""The method by which these expenses are estimated is generally the same as that used by actuaries for all health 
insurance premium calculations."" "
236,9," Plaintiffs suggest that no federal case considering the reach of the term ""business of insurance"" has created ""insurance"" where 
the state did not consider ""insurance"" to exist.  The Court cannot accept this flat assertion.  In Nankin Hospital v. Michigan 
Hospital Service, 361 F. Supp. 1199 (E. D. Mich. 1973), the district court determined that the defendant (the Michigan Blue 
Cross Plan) was in the ""business of insurance"".  However, in the case of Michigan Hospital Service v. Sharpe, 339 Mich. 357, 63 
N. W. 2d 638 (1954), the Michigan Supreme Court held that the same entity, Michigan Hospital Service, was not an insurance 
company, but rather was engaged in the business of providing health care. The state case was not cited in Nankin. In Commander Leasing Co. v. Transamerica Title Insurance Co., 477 F.2d 77, 83 (10th Cir. 1973), the court noted that certain of 
the defendants, domestic land title insurance companies, were formerly subject to regulation by the State Bank Commissioner.  
This fact was not considered determinative in deciding whether the companies were engaged in the business of insurance."
236,10," Page 3 of the uncontroverted affidavit of Guy F. Chetalat, filed in support of CDS' motion for summary judgment, states: ""To determine a premium rate, the estimated cost of administration of the program provided for by the contract and an 
amount to compensate CDS for its assumption of the risk of contracting to provide benefits for a fixed premium are added 
to the estimated cost of paying claims for benefits.  * * * The volume of dental services and the level of dentists' fees are the 
major variable factors which determine [the policy premium] * * *."""
236,11," It is clear that the McCarran-Ferguson Act (McCarran Act) does not extend protection from the antitrust laws to all activities of 
insurance companies.  SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668, 89 S. Ct. 564 (1969); Center Insurance 
Agency, Inc. v. Byers, CCH TRADE REGULATION REPORTS P 60,940 (N. D. Ill. 1976); Hill v. National Auto Glass Co., CCH 
TRADE REGULATION REPORTS P 73,594 (N. D. Cal. 1971).  However, in light of the above-discussed cases, this Court "
237,," cannot accept plaintiffs' suggestion that the McCarran Act does not apply where an insurance company has allegedly conspired 
with noninsurance defendants to violate the federal antitrust laws. Center Insurance and Hill are inapposite to the case at bar 
since here the challenged conduct has a substantial effect on rates and does not involve predatory practices. Hill involved an alleged conspiracy between insurance companies and an automobile glass shop franchiser to fix prices, allocate 
business, and boycott competitors.  Subsequent courts have interpreted Hill as applying to situations where the impact of the 
alleged anticompetitive activity on the rate-making structure of the insurer is insubstantial or tangential.  Travelers Insurance Co. 
v. Blue Cross, 481 F.2d 80, 83 (3d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1093, 38 L. Ed. 2d 550, 94 S. Ct. 724 (1973). Center Insurance involved an alleged conspiracy to pirate trade secrets and other confidential information.  No such claim is 
alleged here. "
238,12," Plaintiffs contended that the activities of CDS challenged in the complaint were not subject to state regulation since the Knox-
Mills Act did not provide for rate regulation. SeeCal. Govt. Code § 12536(d).  It appears that the newly enacted Knox-Keene 
Health Care Service Plan Act, Cal. Health & Saf. Code § 1340, et seq., does set forth a scheme of such regulation. This newly 
enacted scheme is certainly relevant in determining whether the activities of CDS are subject to state regulation. Mitgang v. 
Western Title Insurance Co., CCH TRADE REGULATION REPORTS P 75,322 (N. D. Cal. 1974).  There the court noted: ""Additionally, rates for title insurance are now regulated by California law.  In their complaint, plaintiffs had alleged that there 
was no state regulation, but, as plaintiffs have themselves pointed out to the Court (and the Court takes judicial notice), 
effective January 1, 1974, Insurance Code § 12401 et seq. does in fact set forth a scheme of rate regulation."" Id. at 98,026. "
239,13," Plaintiffs' argument boils down to the simple proposition that the McCarran Act is inapposite because CDS is not regarded as 
an ""insurer"" under state law. It is interesting to note that both the state legislature and the state courts have recognized 
substantial similarities between health care service plans like CDS and ""insurers"". In People v. California Mutual Ass'n, 68 Cal. 2d 677, 68 Cal. Rptr. 585, 441 P.2d 97 (1968), the California Supreme Court was 
presented with the issue of whether a Knox-Mills health care service plan was subject to the supervision of the Insurance 
Commissioner.  If so, the plan would be required to comply with the financial responsibility provisions of the Insurance Code, 
including the maintenance of paid-in capital and surplus, and the payment of premium taxes.  The court conceded a health plan 
was similar to insurance; however, it further recognized that the direct service feature of such a plan warranted special treatment 
of health plans.  Swayed by the policy consideration that a requirement of financial reserves for a service plan would be ""a 
useless and uneconomic waste"", the court held that such a plan was not an insurer. The state legislature has also recognized the similarity between health care service plans and other health insurance programs.  
See 1963 Assembly Interim Committee on Finance and Insurance Report on Pre-paid Health Plans at 28.  Recent legislation 
requiring full disclosure of health insurance policy information applied to health care service plans, as well as ""insurers"" under 
state law. Cal. Stats. 1974, Chap. 936, amending the Knox-Mills Act, Cal. Govt. Code §§ 12537.1-12537.3, and the California 
Insurance Code Sections 10600 to 10608."
239,14," In a prior motion to dismiss in this action, CDS asserted that the conduct challenged in the complaint was not subject to 
antitrust attack under the Cartwright Act, Cal Bus. & Prof. Code § 16700 et seq., because of a ""learned profession"" exception to 
the state antitrust laws. Willis v. Santa Ana Community Hospital Ass'n, 58 Cal. 2d 806, 26 Cal. Rptr. 640, 376 P.2d 568 (1962). 
The continued vitality of this exception after the recent Supreme Court decision in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 
44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975), is a matter which should most appropriately be decided by a state court.  This, of 
course, militates against retention of the pendent state claims.  Moreover, this Court previously denied CDS' motion to dismiss 
the Cartwright Act claim, and CDS has accepted this as the ""law of the case"". "
245,*," The effect of the new provision set forth in paragraph 1(d) of section IV of the settlement agreement is to raise the monthly 
rental payment of relatively low volume dealers. For example, a dealer selling 30,000 gallons of gasoline per month would be 
making a monthly rental payment of $450 instead of $50. It was the unanimous opinion of those testifying at the hearing held on 
the proposed settlement that the current rent provisions in the dealer agreements are unfairly low. "
258,1," By order of August 9, 1961 in F. D. 20812, the ICC authorized the further subordination of the notes to REA loans for terminal 
construction and equipment acquisition. Certain REA -- railroad agreements implementing this authorization additionally 
provided for the subordination of the notes to ""indebtedness or obligations of REA incurred in the future if the Board of Directors 
of REA, when authorizing such indebtedness or obligations, adopts a resolution declaring such subordination."" "
260,2," On February 18, 1975, REA filed a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act and was granted debtor-in-possession 
status. The bankruptcy court entered an order on March 21, 1975 permitting the litigation to continue. REA was adjudicated a 
bankrupt on November 6, 1975. By order of April 8, 1976, Bankruptcy Judge Galgay authorized REA's trustee to seek the setting 
aside of the ICC approval of the notes, the repayment of amounts already paid on them and other relief."

971 (1951), the Report concluded: Nothing in these opinions should be interpreted as justifying the conclusion that concerted action solely between a parent 
and subsidiary or subsidiaries, the purpose and effect of which is not coercive restraint of the trade of strangers to the "
264,," corporate family, violates Section 1. Where such concerted action restrains no trade and is designed to restrain no trade 
other than that of the parent and its subsidiaries, Section 1 is not violated. See also ABA, Antitrust Developments 1955-1968 19-22 (1968) (supplementing the 1955 Report)."
264,7," As originally enacted in 1887, § 5 flatly prohibited the pooling of freight or revenue. Act to Regulate Commerce, 24 Stat. 380. 
Transportation Act, 1920, added a provision permitting such agreements when approved by the Commission. 41 Stat. 480-81. 
The Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 905, generally amended the section, yielding the current § 5(1). "
266,8," This may have been occasioned by Commissioner Eastman's criticism, in dissent, of the ""wrong theory"" embodied in article V -- 
""to enhance the value of the express company's securities and safeguard its financial operations."" See 59 I.C.C. at 523-28. "
267,9," In two other § 5(1) proceedings involving REA, the Commission never indicated that the sinking fund arrangement required 
specific § 5(1) approval. See Express Contract, 1929, 275 I.C.C. 739 (1951) (reaffirming § 5(1) approval following government 
antitrust suit); Railway Express Agency, Inc. and Certain Railroad Carriers' Application for Authority to Contract for Pooling and 
Division of Earnings, 227 I.C.C. 517 (1938) (approving addition of Southern Railway Company and affiliates). "
268,10," See also American Rail Box Car Co. -- Pooling, 347 I.C.C. 862, 882-84 (1974), where the Commission referred to its power 
under § 5(9) to react on its own initiative to pooling agreement changes and stated that it has required new approval only when 
the changes ""can clearly be characterized as substantive in nature, and include entirely new service contracts or modifications in 
the basic policy by which pooled revenues are to be distributed."""
268,11," Both the Commission and the reviewing court relied in part on the uniform contract's provision for ""such modification as may, 
in the particular case, be necessary to provide reasonable and non-discriminatory terms"" for furnishing partial service, thus 
indicating that a § 5(1) approval need not be of the exact terms of the agreement. "
269,12," Indeed, in Securities of Western Pacific R.R. Co., supra, 145 I.C.C. at 753, the Commission approved a subsidiary's issuance 
of promissory notes to its parent without competitive bidding, expressly indicating that it did not consider the transaction within §

penalties (a) Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or who believes that he will be 
irrevocably injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereinafter ""person aggrieved"") may file a 
complaint with the Secretary.  Complaints shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the 
Secretary requires.  Upon receipt of such a complaint the Secretary shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or 
persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice.  Within thirty days 
after receiving a complaint, or within thirty days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c) of this 
section, the Secretary shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends 
to resolve it.  If the Secretary decides to resolve the complaint, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged 
discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.  Nothing said or done in 
the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this 
subchapter without the written consent of the persons concerned.  Any employee of the Secretary who shall make public 
any information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be 
fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year. Complaint; limitations; answer; amendments; verification "
292,," (b) A complaint under subsection (a) of this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged 
discriminatory housing practice occurred.  Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations 
of a discriminatory housing practice are based.  Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.  A 
respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him and with the leave of the Secretary, which shall be granted 
whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer at any time.  Both complaints and answers shall 
be verified. Notification of State or local agency of violation of State of local fair housing law; commencement of State or local law 
enforcement proceedings; certification of circumstances requisite for action by Secretary. (c) Wherever a State or local fair housing law provides rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices 
which are substantially equivalent to the rights and remedies provided in this subchapter, the Secretary shall notify the 
appropriate State or local agency of any complaint filed under this subchapter which appears to constitute a violation of 
such State or local fair housing law, and the Secretary shall take no further action with respect to such complaint if the 
appropriate State or local law enforcement official has, within thirty days from the date the alleged offense has been 
brought to his attention, commenced proceedings in the matter, or, having done so, carries forward such proceedings with 
reasonable promptness.  In no event shall the Secretary take further action unless he certifies that in his judgment, under 
the circumstances of the particular case, the protection of the rights of the parties or the interests of justice require such 
action. Commencement of civil actions; State or local remedies available; jurisdiction and venue; findings; injunctions; appropriate 
affirmative orders (d) If within thirty days after a complaint is filed with the Secretary or within thirty days after expiration of any period of 
reference under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this 
subchapter, the person aggrieved may, within thirty days thereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate United 
States district court, against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this 
subchapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint: Provided, That no such civil action may be brought 
in any United States district court if the person aggrieved has a judicial remedy under a State or local fair housing law which 
provides rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices which are substantially equivalent to the rights 
and remedies provided in this subchapter.  Such actions may be brought without regard to the amount in controversy in any 
United States district court for the district in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred or be 
about to occur or in which the respondent resides or transacts business.  If the court finds that a discriminatory housing 
practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may, subject to the provisions of section 3612 of this title, enjoin the 
respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate. Burden of proof (e) In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of proof shall be on the complainant. Trial of action; termination of voluntary compliance efforts (f) Whenever an action filed by an individual, in either Federal or State court, pursuant to this section or section 3612 of this 
title, shall come to trial the Secretary shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary compliance."

United States district courts without regard to the amount in controversy and in appropriate State or local courts of general 
jurisdiction.  A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged discriminatory housing 
practice occurred: Provided, however, That the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or 
section 3610(d) of this title from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the 
Secretary or a State or local agency are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice 
complained of in the complaint made to the Secretary or to the local or State agency and which practice forms the basis for 
the action in court: And provided, however, That any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of 
any court order issued under the authority of this Act, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without 
actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this Act shall not be affected. Appointing of counsel and commencement of civil actions in Federal or State courts without payment of fees, costs, or 
security (b) Upon application by the plaintiff and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, a court of the United States in 
which a civil action under this section has been brought may appoint an attorney for the plaintiff and may authorize the 
commencement of a civil action upon proper showing without the payment of fees, costs, or security.  A court of a State or 
subdivision thereof may do likewise to the extent not inconsistent with the law or procedures of the State or subdivision. Injunctive relief and damages; limitation; court costs; attorney fees (c) The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining 
order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive damages, together 
with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff: Provided, That the said plaintiff in the

304,3," The Sherman Act as amended by the Miller-Tydings Act reads as follows: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal: Provided, That nothing contained in sections 1 to 7 of this 
title shall render illegal, contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale of a commodity which bears, or 
the label or container of which bears, the trademark, brand, or name of the producer or distributor of such commodity and 
which is in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others, when 
contracts or agreements of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions, under any statute, law, or public 
policy now or hereafter in effect in any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia in which such resale is to be made, or to 
which the commodity is to be transported for such resale, and the making of such contracts or agreements shall not be an 
unfair method of competition under Section 45 of this title: Provided further, That the preceding proviso shall not make 
lawful any contract or agreement, providing for the establishment or maintenance of minimum resale prices on any 
commodity herein involved, between manufacturers, or between producers, or between wholesalers, or between brokers, 
or between factors, or between retailers, or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other. Every 
person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1 to 7 of this title to

321,1," The defendants have cross-appealed from the partial award of costs and attorneys' fees.  We do not reach this issue since 
there will be a partial new trial on damages.  They have also cross-appealed the district court's continuation of injunctive relief; 
the court ordered DRI to keep open its employment offers to former distributors and not to discharge any plaintiffs unless 
approved by an arbitrator.  We perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court's continuing its injunction pending appeal; we 
also dissolve the injunction as part of our remand."
321,2," Since the dealers sold to carriers, the district court found that the agreement [established] not a resale price, but a ""resale-
resale price"", the price at which the product is actually sold to the consumer through a carrier level.  (383 F. Supp. at 1350.) The 
court found that the agreement presumed the dealers would take all reasonable steps to insure that the carriers sold at the 
announced subscription price.  Under this agreement, distributor profits were derived from the difference between the 
distributor's purchase price from the publisher and his sale price to the carrier. DRI did not set a uniform wholesale price for all 
distributors, but varied the price to arrive at an agreed-upon income for each distributor. "
322,3," After trial, the district court relieved DRI of its employment obligations because of its precarious financial condition."
322,4," Some courts have decided that there was in fact no conspiracy between people even where the corporate units might have 
conspired.  For example, one person may be the sole decisionmaker in two separate corporations so that there can be no 
conspiracy in the meeting-of-the-minds sense.  ( Windsor Theatre Co. v. Walbrook Amusement Co. (D. Md. 1950) 94 F. Supp. 
388, aff'd (4th Cir. 1951) 189 F.2d 797.) On the other hand, two separate entities can conspire via a person who is a large 
shareholder or an officer in both corporations ( America's Best Cinema Corp. v. Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc. (N.D. Ind. 1972) "
323,347," F. Supp. 328). In America's Best Cinema, however, the court recognized the antitrust significance of the economic units, as 
opposed to the people in charge of them."
323,5," The Court's suggestion in Kiefer-Stewart that commonly-owned firms who pretend to be competitors must act like competitors 
has created some confusion in the lower courts.  The Fifth and Eighth Circuits have held that competition between the corporate 
units is not necessary for a finding of intraenterprise conspiracy. ( Battle v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co. (5th Cir. 1974) 493 F.2d 39, 
44; T.V. Signal Co. v. A.T.&T. (8th Cir. 1972) 462 F.2d 1256, 1260.) The Second and Third Circuits have refused to find an 
intraenterprise conspiracy when competition was lacking.  ( Ark Dental Supply Co. v. Cavitron Corp. (3rd Cir. 1972) 461 F.2d 
1093, 1094-95, n.1; Beckman v. Walter Kidde & Co., Inc. (E.D. N.Y. 1970) 316 F. Supp. 1321, 1325-26, aff'd (2d Cir. 1971) 451 
F.2d 593.) Subsequent to Kiefer-Stewart, the Supreme Court decided Perma Life Mufflers.  There, the Court held that a 
conspiracy was possible despite the fact that the parent and subsidiary were vertically related and were not competing with each 
other.  ( Perma Life Mufflers v. Int'l Parts Corp. (1968) 392 U.S. 134, 141-42, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982. Last term, in 
United States v. Citizens and Southern Nat'l Bank (1975) 422 U.S. 86, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 S. Ct. 2099, the Court, in dicta, noted 
that ""[this] Court has held that even commonly owned firms must compete against each other if they hold themselves out as 
distinct entities."" ( Id. at 116.) "
324,6," Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co. (9th Cir. 1964) 327 F.2d 459 held ""HN6[
] probability of actual monopolization"" is not an essential element of proof in a Section 2 claim.  In a Section 1 claim, however, market definition, as a prelude to showing restraint, is 
required.  ( Twin City Sport Service, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co. (9th Cir. 1975) 512 F.2d 1264, 1274-75.)"
324,7," All of these questions relate to the sales of the newspapers. Similar factors would be important to the sale of advertising space 
- the other product market in which newspapers compete. "
325,8," In their complaint plaintiffs alleged two vertical restraints on trade: (1) the dealership agreements in effect from 1969 until the 
terminations, and (2) the carrier agreements used after the terminations. On appeal, they raise also the ""combinations"" between 
the publisher and (a) the street sale dealers and/or (b) the motor route distributors. We may not consider the new claims; they 
were not raised below and unlike Perma Life Mufflers, supra, note 5, where the Supreme Court permitted such a ""shotgun"" 
approach, this is not an appeal from a summary judgment but from a full-fledged trial and the district court's detailed findings of 
fact and conclusions of law.  Moreover, these agreements and the carrier agreements go to Sparks' alleged continuation of the 
retail price fix after the illegal contracts were terminated.  If they were in furtherance of the scheme, no additional ""contract 
combination or conspiracy"" need be shown.  The dealership agreements were not raised on appeal."
325,9," Trixler Brokerage Co. v. Ralston Purina Co. (9th Cir. 1974) 505 F.2d 1045, 1051; Bushie v. Stenocord Corp. (9th Cir. 1972) 460 
F.2d 116, 119. But cf.  United States v. Colgate (1919) 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465."
325,10," The general legality of internal distribution creates the paradox of the case law on intrabrand restraints.  The opinions in this 
area are often cast in terms of price competition in the sales of a single brand.  Thus, HN8[
] a manufacturer cannot confine its 
independent distributors to a certain territory or fix their resale price, because these restraints determine the price at which the 
brand is sold.  Yet, a manufacturer can assume full control over the price of his product, if he integrates forward into distribution 
and eliminates any possibility of intrabrand competition. The reason for this ""double standard"" goes all the way back to Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co. (1911) 220 U.S. 373, 
55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376, in which the Court outlawed resale price maintenance because § 1 incorporated the ancient 
prohibition against restraints on alienation.  Since this is the doctrinal basis of the per se rule against resale price maintenance, 
the rule is difficult to apply to cases where there is no ""alienation."" "
326,11," The Germon court also implied that terminations in retaliation for the antitrust action might be prohibited.  (520 F.2d at 787.) 
Retaliation is difficult to find in Knutson since all distributors for both companies were terminated, not merely the plaintiffs.  
Moreover, the district court found that Sparks acted out of a real concern for maintaining a high level of circulation in order to 
keep his advertising revenues.  (383 F. Supp. at 1362-63.)"
326,12," Because the issue is unlawful control vel non, the extended discussion by the district court (383 F. Supp. at 1362-65) and the 
defendants of the economic need for newspapers to maintain a low subscription price is not really in point.  Resale price 
maintenance is unlawful per se and Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, implicitly rejected 
newspapers' ""dual market"" (advertising and newspaper sale) position as a justification for maximum price fixing. (390 U.S. at 
151-54.) Thus, while the economic imperatives of the newspaper business might explain why Sparks wanted to control (lawfully 
or unlawfully) resale prices, they do not affect the legality of the methods he used."
326,13," ""NOTICE OF RATE INCREASE ""Effective August 1, 1975 the Publisher will increase the wholesale rate charged Argus carriers to $2.92 per month.  At the 
same time, the suggested subscription rate will be increased to $3.75 per month. ""To prevent the loss of circulation and of carrier profits, the Publisher plans a massive promotion campaign based on the 
cooperative efforts of carriers, the circulation department and professional solicitors.  The success of that campaign, and 
the ability of the office and the professional solicitors to help you build circulation on your route, depend on a uniform 
subscription price.  We, therefore, strongly recommend that you charge your subscribers the suggested rate of $3.75 per 
month. ""Last November when Mr. Benham became an employee at the Argus, the company reduced your monthly wholesale rate 
from $2.54 to $2.32 per subscriber, giving you a large increase in profit margin.  We want you to continue earning those 
increased profits, so we plan to give you a bonus each month on every subscription you deliver.  An employee of the 
company will contact you and your parents to explain the details of this program.  Receipt of the bonus does not depend on 
your charging the suggested subscription rate, but - the more subscribers you have - the more bonuses you will earn. ""REMEMBER: Increased circulation is good for everybody and means more profits for you!"" "
327,14," This analysis of the issue has been accepted with some variations by four Circuits.  The Second Circuit, in a pre-Schwinn 
price-fixing case applied it and held that in the absence of an express contract provision, there must be a course of conduct 
showing a restraint of the dealer's freedom.  ( Susser v. Carvel Corp. (2d Cir. 1964) 332 F.2d 505, 510.) After Schwinn, however, 
that court required evidence of firm and resolute enforcement despite an express contractual customer limitation.  ( Janel Sales 
Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc. (2d Cir. 1968) 396 F.2d 398, 400, 406-07.) The Tenth Circuit has recently followed Janel and held 
that a contractual provision clearly prohibiting sales outside a territory is not in itself a per se violation; firm and resolute 
enforcement must be shown. ( Redd v. Shell Oil Co. (10th Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 1054-58.) Although the Fifth Circuit, in dictum has 
set itself against the firm and resolute requirement, even in the context of implicit agreements ( Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph 
Coors Co. (5th Cir. 1975) 506 F.2d 934, 943), it has found such enforcement in the cases before it.  ( Id. at 944; Hobart Bros. "
328,," Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliard, Inc. (5th Cir. 1973) 471 F.2d 894, 900-901; Eastex Aviation, Inc. v. Sperry & Hutchinson (5th Cir. 
1975) 522 F.2d 1299, 1307; Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp. (5th Cir. 1972) 464 F.2d 26, 38.) The First Circuit has also endorsed a 
requirement that there be enforcement measures in a case involving no contractual restriction.  ( Butera v. Sun Oil Co. (1st Cir. 
1974) 496 F.2d 434, 437.)"
328,15," See note 1, supra."
328,16," Because the subscription rate was unlawfully fixed by the publisher, plaintiffs claim that the territorial set-up was ancillary to 
the price-fixing scheme, and thus per se unlawful.  In Schwinn, the Court stated in dicta that territorial restrictions that are ""part of 
a scheme of unlawful price fixing"" are per se violations.  (388 U.S. at 373, citing United States v. Sealy, Inc. (1967) 388 U.S. 350, 
18 L. Ed. 2d 1238, 87 S. Ct. 1847.) In Sealy, the Court found that the exclusive territories gave each participant ""an enclave in 
which it could and did zealously and effectively maintain resale prices, free from the danger of outside incursions."" ( Id. at 356.) 
The Sealy price fix, however, was a minimum price, which meant that exclusive territories protected each seller from competition 
by price cutters.  The relationship between the maximum price fix and territoriality in Knutson is quite different.  Exclusive 
territories inhibit the maximum price fix since they prevent control of the price by competitive forces.  Thus, in Albrecht, the 
newspaper tried to encourage competition in the territory of a dealer who priced above the fixed maximum. (390 U.S. at 147-49.) "
329,17," Moreover, the system seems to be contrary to the publisher's interests.  Since the volume of circulation is of critical importance 
to the newspapers' prime revenue source, advertising, one would expect incentives rather than disincentives to increased 
subscriptions. The inferences that can be drawn from this fact are limited, however, since distributors were not relied upon to 
generate new subscriptions. The profits of professional solicitors and carriers were not affected by the higher rate; these two 
groups (in conjunction with newspaper employees) were responsible for nearly all new subscriptions. "
330,18," They also claimed loss of the going concern value of their dealerships and sought an injunction to enable them to continue in 
business.  Since, as the district court found (383 F. Supp. 1384-89) and we affirm, the terminations, pursuant to a valid contract, 
were legal and did not further an antitrust violation, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any damages other than their profits lost 
during the period of the violation. "
332,19," In another case we employed another corollary of the assumption of profit-maximizing behavior.  In Gray v. Shell Oil Co. (9th 
Cir. 1972) 469 F.2d 742, gasoline distributors claimed that the oil company's control over retail prices prevented them from 
raising their prices and realizing a higher profit.  Citing evidence that dealer price hikes had resulted in a decrease in profits, the 
court held that the fact of damage was not proven.  (469 F.2d at 749-50.)"
332,20," If the court does not believe that all plaintiffs would have immediately raised their prices in the same amount had the 
contractual restraint been removed, then it should draw reasonable inferences as to when and how much each plaintiff would 
have altered his or her price.  If some plaintiffs' claimed monthly profit increases are excessive, then the damage award should 
be reduced to an account reasonably supported by the evidence.  If the court is dissatisfied with plaintiffs' summaries of their 
operations, it may require that the supporting documents be submitted. "
334,21," Moreover, the specific offense of maximum resale price fixing could be used to destroy (or exclude) competition or build a 
monopoly. If the fixed maximum price is higher than cost but lower than a price that would permit new entrants or smaller scale 
competitors to operate (i.e., a ""limit price""), then, although not predatory, it could support other efforts to acquire a monopoly."

348,11," Illustrations 4, 5 and 6 accompanying this comment demonstrate how a court's judgment can be, but usually is not, an act of 
state:"
348,4," . In a suit in tort by X against Y, a court of state A decides that X is entitled to a specified amount of damages. This 
decision is not an act of state within the meaning of the rule stated in this Section."

This decision is not an act of state within the meaning of the rule stated in this Section."
348,6," . State A obtains by eminent domain proceedings title to an electric utility system in its territory. The vesting of title is an 
act of state within the meaning of the rule stated in this Section. As used in this Restatement, ""state"" refers to a sovereign nation, not to one of the United States. "
349,12," The subject of extraterritorial jurisdiction of American antitrust laws is one about which there has been a great deal of 
discussion. The commentaries cited in this opinion represent only a fraction of those discussing the subject. Worthy of special 
comment are K. Brewster, Antitrust and American Business Abroad (1958), and W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust 
Laws (2d ed. 1973). There has, however, been much less action. In actual litigation, jurisdiction has not often been found 
lacking. Up to May 1973, the Department of Justice filed some 248 foreign trade antitrust cases; not one was lost for want of 
jurisdiction over the activities claimed to violate the law. W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws, App.  B. at 498 
(2d ed. 1973). The instant case is, of course, a private action, but reported dismissals of such cases also appear to be 
infrequent. The only case lost on appeal on this ground was American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 29 S. Ct. 
511, 53 L. Ed. 826 (1909), a decision which is today considered largely obsolete. Rahl, Foreign Commerce Jurisdiction of the 
American Antitrust Laws, 43 Antitrust L.J. 521 (1974)."
349,13," For an extended discussion of this evolution, see W. Fugate, supra, at 40-43, 66-73; Report of the Attorney General's National 
Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 66-76 (1955). "
350,14," The tendency seems to be for federal regulatory statutes to contain sweeping jurisdictional language. Sections 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, reach, respectively, ""every contract . . . in restraint of . . ."" and ""every person who shall 
monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . any part of"" ""the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations."" Although it may be ""evident from the text of the antitrust statutes"" that ""some [actual or intended] effect on our foreign 
commerce is a prerequisite to jurisdiction,"" Occidental Petroleum, 331 F. Supp. at 102 (emphasis in original), the statutory terms 
themselves are not precise or limited enough to provide additional guidance to the courts. See Trautman, Appendix to Chapter 
11 in K. Brewster, supra, at 313."
350,15," Such an assertion of authority based on internal consequences is generally described as the ""objective territorial"" principle of 
jurisdiction. See W. Fugate, supra, at 35-39."
350,16," See, e.g., A. Neale, supra, at 362-72; Haight, Comment to Miller, supra, 111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1117, 1118-20 (1963); Ellis,

350,17," We note, though, that Swiss Watch and General Electric were there discussing aliens, not American citizens. Oldham said that 
the existence of a direct and substantial effect satisfied jurisdictional questions, but it did not say that jurisdiction could not be 
based on other considerations."
350,18, Restatement § 18 reads: 
351,," A state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct that occurs outside its territory 
and causes an effect within its territory, if either (a) the conduct and its effect are generally recognized as constituent elements of a crime or tort under the law of states that 
have reasonably developed legal systems, or (b)(i) the conduct and its effect are constituent elements of activity to which the rule applies; (ii) the effect within the territory 
is substantial; (iii) it occurs as a direct and foreseeable result of the conduct outside the territory; and (iv) the rule is not 
inconsistent with the principles of justice generally recognized by states that have reasonably developed legal systems. The ""direct"" and ""substantial"" requirements come from (b)(ii) and (iii).  Comment a to this section specifically indicates, however, 
that this rule applies only to aliens, since United States citizens may be bound by nationality, and only where there has been no 
significant conduct within the United States, since otherwise territorial jurisdiction could be asserted."
351,19," This portion of Alcoa referred only to a combination of foreigners, specifically for whom the intent requirement may have been 
imposed, not American citizens or corporations. Further, Judge Hand's opinion noted that either intent or effect individually might 
suffice, but that both were present in that case, so that question did not have to be faced."

rule prescribed by that state. President (then Professor) Brewster lists the variables of: (a) the relative significance to the violations charged of conduct within the United States as compared with conduct abroad; 
(b) the extent to which there is explicit purpose to harm or affect American consumers or Americans' business 
opportunities; (c) the relative seriousness of effects on the United States compared with those abroad; (d) the nationality or 
allegiance of the parties or in the case of business associations, their corporate location, and the fairness of applying our 
law to them; (e) the degree of conflict with foreign laws and policies, and (f) the extent to which conflict can be avoided

354,32," Particularly in the field of trade regulation, American laws may not be duplicated by the other nation. That does not necessarily 
indicate a ""conflict,"" however, since non-prohibition does not always mean affirmative approval. See P. Areeda, supra at 127. "
355,33," Some argue that a defendant's American citizenship might be enough by itself to support jurisdiction. See Foreign Relations 
Law Restatement § 30."
355,34," In requiring district courts to assess the conflicting contacts and interests of those nations involved, we do not thereby assign 
them the same task which the ""act of state"" doctrine prohibits them from undertaking. As the quotation from comment d. to § 41 
of the Restatement, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1965), see pp. 607-608, supra, makes clear, there is 
an important distinction between examining the validity of the ""public interests"" which are involved in a sovereign policy decision 
amounting to an ""act of state"" and evaluating the relative ""interests"" which each state may have ""in providing the means of 
adjudicating disputes or claims that arise within its territory."" Our ""jurisdictional rule of reason"" does not in any way require the 
court to question the ""validity"" of ""foreign law or policy."" Rather, the legitimacy of each nation's interests is assumed. It is merely 
the relative involvement and concern of each state with the suit at hand that is to be evaluated in determining whether 
extraterritorial jurisdiction should be exercised by American courts as a matter of comity and fairness."
355,35," Our separation in the foreign commerce context between the degree of restraint necessary for establishing subject matter 
jurisdiction as opposed to that required to state a claim is, of course, not duplicated in the interstate setting, for there a 
""substantial"" restraint is in any event necessary for the establishment of jurisdiction itself. Nevertheless, since the interstate 
cases provide a standard for both jurisdiction and the statement of a claim, Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of the Rex Hospital, 
425 U.S. 738, 742, n.1 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976), they thus offer some guidance for determining the degree of 
restraint necessary to support a claim for relief in the foreign commerce context as well, see Occidental Petroleum, 331 F. Supp. 
at 102-03. Although the decision whether the restraint alleged in the instant case qualifies to state a claim is for the district court 
in the first instance, we note that the quantitative test of substantiality is a ""practical, case-by-case economic judgment,"" not one

386,1," The seven major oil producer defendants are Mobil Oil Corporation, Exxon Corporation, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Ltd., 
Texaco, Inc., Standard Oil Company of California, The British Petroleum Company, Ltd. and Gulf Oil Corporation. They explore 
for, produce and refine crude oil, transport both crude oil and refined petroleum products and market refined petroleum products. 
The bulk of their crude oil production (about 90%) is in the Persian Gulf area (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, 
Dubai and Oman). Gulf has no Libyan production. Defendants Occidental, Gelsenberg and Grace are diversified companies 
producing crude oil in Libya. "
387,2, THIRD CLAIM
387,61, . Plaintiff Hunt realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 45.
387,62," . Since at least 1970, the seven majors along with co-conspirators named and not named, have engaged in a combination 
and/or conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of the foreign trade and commerce of the United States, in violation of the Sherman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and of Section 73 of the Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. § 8."
387,63," . As part of the unlawful conduct complained of, the seven majors have combined and conspired among themselves to 
preserve the competitive advantage of Persian Gulf crude oil relative to that of Libyan crude oil, and to diminish competition from 
Libyan crude oil producers. To these ends they have combined and conspired to prevent plaintiff Hunt and other Libyan 
producers from reaching any agreement with the Libyan government inconsistent with that competitive advantage, even where 
they knew that the necessary and foreseeable consequence of their conduct would be Hunt's elimination as a Libyan crude oil 
producer."
387,64," . In furtherance of this unlawful combination and conspiracy, the seven majors entered into written agreements with Hunt and 
other Libyan producers, manipulated the course of Libyan negotiations so as to advance their own interests in the Persian Gulf, 
and followed a course of action that led to Hunt's nationalization and elimination from the production of Libyan crude oil."
387,65," . By reason of this unlawful combination and conspiracy, Hunt has been and will continue to be injured in his business and 
property. He has sustained damages, the full extent of which cannot presently be calculated, but which include lost profits on his 
half interest in the 11 billion barrels of crude oil contained in the Sarir Field. "
388,3," The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall with whom Justices Brennan, Stewart and Blackmun joined would have held the 
acts complained of within the proscription of the act of state doctrine.  96 S. Ct. at 1871."

Foreign Relations, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 6, at 316-17 (1974). The commentary that accompanied Libya's Law 42 of 1973 
that effectuated the seizure described the act as ""a warning to the United States to end its recklessness and hostility to the Arab 
nation."" It further stated that, ""In view of . . . American impudence and the continued disregard for Arab rights and destinies, it 
was necessary to strike a blow against U.S. policy. . . ."" A. Rovine, Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1973 at 
334."
388,5," A. Rovine, Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1973 at 335."
388,6," Appellants argue that Mr. Justice Holmes had a uniquely narrow view of the Sherman Act. His disaffection for that legislation 
needs little documentation. E.g., Letter from Justice Holmes to Harold J. Laski, March 4, 1920, in 1 Holmes-Laski Letters 248-49 
(1953 ed. M. Howe). However, the comment is not really germane. The unanimous opinion of the Court is hardly suspect 
because of the possible animus of its author. In any event, as we shall develop, the antitrust and act of state elements of the 
decision are distinct. "
389,7," Most commentators have also concluded that American Banana's precedential value on the act of state doctrine was 
undiminished by Sisal or any other case cited for that proposition by appellants. E.g., A.B.A., Antitrust Developments 365 (1975); 
K. Brewster, Antitrust and American Business Abroad 97 (1958); W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws § 2.21 
(1973). "
390,8," Appellants also contend that American Banana is inapplicable because Hunt relies on not only the Sherman Act but also the 
Wilson Tariff Act which ""was not in existence when American Banana was decided."" Since the antitrust provision of the Wilson 
Tariff Act was initially enacted in 1894, Act of Aug. 27, 1894, c. 349, § 73, 28 Stat. 570, in substantially the same language as 
appears presently, 15 U.S.C. § 8, the argument is fallacious. In any event, this argument only relates to jurisdiction and does not 
affect the act of state issue. In so far as the substantive antitrust provisions of the Wilson Tariff Act are concerned, they follow 
the same pattern as the Sherman Act. United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 608, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. Ct. 742 (1941); 
see W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws § 13.2 (2d ed. 1973)."
390,9," Occidental in fact supports the holding below and the discussion here on the vitality of American Banana. Thus the court, while 
recognizing that the restrictive view of Mr. Justice Holmes in American Banana as to the territorial reach of the Sherman Act has 
not survived subsequent Supreme Court holdings, found that the act of state holding there applied has endured unscathed.  331 
F. Supp. at 109-10."
390,10," PP 34, 40, 41 of the complaint. "
391,11," Appellants urge on appeal that the interpretation of the third claim below was unduly narrow since P 63 of the complaint, 
supra, note 2, also charged that the defendants conspired to preserve the competitive advantage of Persian Gulf crude oil over 
that of Libyan and thus to diminish competition by preventing Hunt from reaching any agreement with the Libyan government 
inconsistent with that advantage. However, Hunt's first claim which alleges a conspiracy among the defendants in violation of 
both the Sherman and Wilson Tariff Acts states in P 50(b) of the complaint that the major producers took steps to restrain 
competition by, ""Negotiation and administration of the Libyan Producers' Agreement so as to disadvantage Libyan oil relative to 
Persian Gulf oil."" That claim was not dismissed and Hunt is therefore not precluded from raising the issue at trial. Judge 
Weinfeld specifically found the act of state doctrine unavailable to the defendants on this count.  410 F. Supp. at 20-21. "
392,12," The importance of a unified national voice on foreign policy has been recognized since the founding of the republic. See The 
Federalist No. 42 (J. Madison). HN11[
] The judiciary, even when it has had jurisdiction, has traditionally been reluctant to 
infringe on the executive's authority in the area of foreign affairs. This has resulted in the application of the political question 
doctrine to find such issues non-justiciable. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211-13, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663, 82 S. Ct. 691 (1962)."
392,13," See Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 484 F.2d 1307, 1310-11 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 936, 40 L. Ed. 2d 286, 94 S. Ct. 
1935 (1974), and Mitchell v. Laird, 159 U.S. App. D.C. 344, 488 F.2d 611, 616 (1973), which emphasize the difficulty of a judicial 
tribunal in making determinations of political and diplomatic dimensions in the arena of foreign affairs, an area entrusted to the 
discretion of the President and the Department of State."
392,14," Our dissenting brother parts company with us when we say that in order to prove their damages, plaintiffs will be required to 
establish the motivation for the Libyan expropriation and that this inevitably involves its validity. He further argues that Libya is 
shielded from antitrust liability. We agree that Libya cannot be guilty of a Sherman Act violation. This is certainly so here since it 
is not a party and, in any event, it could not be because it is not a person or corporation within the terms of the Act but a 
sovereign state.  Interamerican Refining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (D. Del. 1970); Fugate, 
Antitrust Jurisdiction and Foreign Sovereignty, 49 Va. L. Rev. 925, 932 (1962); K. Brewster, Antitrust and American Business 
Abroad 94 (1958).  (There is no claim here that Libya was performing a purely commercial act.) When we have discussed the 
""validity"" of the act of confiscation we are not using the term in an antitrust sense but rather in an international law context. The 
plaintiffs admittedly can only succeed if they establish the motivation of Libya in making the seizure. The United States has 
characterized it as an act of political reprisal. We are now asked to determine that Libya would not have so acted had it not been 
for the conspiracy of the defendants. As recently indicated in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 
1976), ""We wish to avoid 'passing on the validity' of foreign acts.  Sabbatino, 376 U.S. at 423. Similarly, we do not wish to 
challenge the sovereignty of another nation, the wisdom of its policy, or the integrity and motivation of its action."" See The 
Restatement, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 41 (1965), HN12[
] ""[A] court in the United States . . . will 
refrain from examining the validity of an act of a foreign state by which that state has exercised its jurisdiction to give effect to its 
public interests."" The dissent also urges that Libya's authorization, approval, encouragement or participation in restrictive private conduct confers 
no antitrust immunity on the wrongdoer. But this is not a case of Libyan participation in antitrust wrongdoing. The complaint is 
rather that Libya like Hunt was a ""victim"" of the conspiracy. "
394,1," The Court's reference to Continental as an example of state ""participation"" indicates that it reads its decision in Continental 
differently than do my brothers, who find no act of the sovereign to have been involved in that case."
394,2," In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 n. 9 (1969) the Court 
said: "
395,," It is enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible 
alternative sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under § 4."
395,3," In Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Buttes Gas & Oil Co., 331 F. Supp. 92 (C.D.Calif. 1971), aff'd per curiam, 461 F.2d 1261 (9th 
Cir.), cert.  denied, 409 U.S. 950, 93 S. Ct. 272, 34 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1972), relied upon by the majority, the complaint alleged that 
the ruler of Sharjah, at the instigation of defendants, falsely asserted a claim to certain off-shore drilling areas not within its 
territorial waters. Since plaintiffs' claim was premised upon this assertion of wrongdoing and called into question the location of 
Sharjah's territorial boundaries, I find this case clearly distinguishable from the one before us. "
404,1," Section 1 reads in pertinent part as follows: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."
404,2," Each of the corporate defendants received the maximum $50,000 fine.  Brown also drew a $50,000 fine, as well as a six-month 
suspended sentence and three years probation. Watt received a $10,000 fine, a six-month suspended sentence, and one year 
probation. Nicely was fined $1,000 and received a six-month suspended sentence and one year probation. After the indictment 
in this case was handed up, § 1 was amended to provide for a maximum fine of $1,000,000 for corporate defendants and 
$100,000 for other persons.  15 U.S.C. § 1 (1970), as amended, (Supp. IV, 1974). "
405,3," The other defendants were Graham J. Morgan, chairman of the board of USG; William H. Hunt, president of G-P; William D. 
Herbert, president of Celotex; Kaiser Gypsum Company; Claude E. Harper and Robert A. Costa, Kaiser's president and vice-
president, respectively; The Flintkote Company; and George J. Pecaro and James D. Moran, Flintkote's chairman of the board 
and president, respectively. The indictment named as co-conspirators, but not as defendants, Johns-Manville Corporation; 
Fibreboard Corporation; and the Gypsum Association, the industry trade association."
405,4," Kaiser and Flintkote each received the maximum $50,000 fine. Morgan (USG) received a $40,000 fine, a six-month suspended 
sentence and two years probation. Hunt (G-P) and Harper (Kaiser) each drew a $40,000 fine, a six-month suspended sentence, 
and eighteen months probation. Herbert (Celotex), Costa (Kaiser), Pecaro (Flintkote), and Moran (Flintkote) each received a 
$20,000 fine, a thirty-day suspended sentence, and one year probation. "
407,5," In concluding that the Government bears the burden of proving that no unavailable witness would have offered significant, 
exculpatory evidence, the Barket court relied on United States v. Norton, 504 F.2d 342 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 
1113, 42 L. Ed. 2d 811, 95 S. Ct. 790 (1975). Norton, however, involved an unusual situation. The Government intentionally 
delayed its arrest of Norton on drug charges so that its informant, a key witness, could remain undercover and gather evidence 
for other prosecutions. Before Norton's arrest, the informant was murdered.  The Eighth Circuit held that the Government had to 
accept the risk that its conscious decision to delay Norton's prosecution might result in the unavailability of a witness necessary 
to guarantee Norton a fair trial.  Therefore, the burden of showing the informant's lack of exculpatory evidence was placed on the 
Government. Norton, however, was held to have waived the right to argue that the delay had prejudiced his defense, because 
he had rejected the Government's offer of proof on the issue of the informant's probable testimony.  Id. at 504 F.2d 342. Whatever the merits of the Norton holding in the context of informant cases, we do not believe that it should be extended beyond 
that special context. HN6[
] An informant in a drug case is a potential witness who may be presumed to possess unique 
knowledge about the transaction.  Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 64, 77 S. Ct. 623, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1957). No such 
special presumption attaches to the usual witnesses in other cases. See United States v. Dukow, 453 F.2d 1328, 1330 (3d Cir.), 
cert. denied, 406 U.S. 945, 32 L. Ed. 2d 331, 92 S. Ct. 2042 (1972). "
408,6," On this point, the court charged as follows: Secondly, you must determine whether the purpose for the exchange of competitive information between the Defendants 
and their alleged coconspirators was to insure a good faith meeting of competition, as a defense to the Robinson-Patman 
Act. If you decide that, if you decide this was merely done in a good faith effort to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, then 
you could not consider verification, standing alone, as establishing an agreement to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize prices 
as charged. However, if you decide that the effect of these exchanges was to raise, fix, maintain, and stabilize the price of gypsum 
wallboard, then you may consider these exchanges as evidence of the mutual agreement or understanding alleged in the 
indictment to raise, fix, maintain and stabilize list prices. (Emphasis added)."
408,7," Section 2(a) reads in pertinent part as follows: HN10[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, 
or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other 
place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. . . ."
408,8," Section 2(b) reads as follows: HN11[
] Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in 
price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall 
be upon the person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the 
Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein 
contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of 
services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or 
the services or facilities furnished by a competitor. "
410,9," If purpose were always irrelevant, as Judge Weis's dissent declares, then the Container Court would effectively have overruled 
Cement Manufacturers. See The Supreme Court, 1968 Term, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 7, 234-5 (1960). Yet the vitality of Cement 
Manufacturers has been reaffirmed by favorable citation in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar Ass'n, 421 U.S. 773, 781, 44 L. Ed. 2d 
572, 95 S. Ct. 2004, reh. denied, 423 U.S. 886, 96 S. Ct. 162, 46 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1975), and United States v. Citizens & 
Southern Nat'l Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 113, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 S. Ct. 2099 (1975). Those cases also cite Justice Fortas's Container 
concurrence, suggesting that Container did not establish a per se rule against information exchanges, but left some to qualify as 
legitimate under the Sherman Act. Judge Weis's dissenting opinion also attempts to liken the factual setting in the case sub judice to that found violative of the 
Sherman Act in Container. The dissent notes that the district court in Container found that buyers ""on occasion"" furnished 
inaccurate information as to competing sellers' prices, see United States v. Container Corp. of America, 273 F. Supp. 18, 28 
(M.D. N.C. 1967), and held that the desire to prevent fraud took the container manufacturers outside the Sherman Act ban. All this is irrelevant to the case at hand. Here, fraud is not at issue. Indeed, the Container opinion makes it clear that HN15[
] 
mere bad faith bargaining does not amount to ""fraud"" in the Cement Manufacturers sense. What appellants urge here, though, is not a desire simply to avert occasional bad faith bargaining, but to comply with the positive 
duties imposed by another statute, the Robinson-Patman Act. The Robinson-Patman defense was not raised by the Container 
defendants at trial and was argued to the Supreme Court merely as an afterthought. That Court did not deal with it. The question before us, then, is not whether occasional, or even widespread, buyer prevarication justifies price information 
exchanges, but whether the commands of Robinson-Patman may sometimes do so, when accommodated to Sherman Act 
strictures. "
412,10," Section 2(f), 15 U.S.C. § 13(f), reads as follows: HN20[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, knowingly to induce 
or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section. "
413,11, Neither Judge Adams nor Judge Weis agrees with this view. 
414,12," Relevant portions of the charge are as follows: Now I want to charge you at this time that it is your duty to give separate consideration to the charges against each of the 
Defendants, whether they were a corporation or an individual. Each must be passed upon by you separately. You may find 
all the Defendants guilty. You may find all of the Defendants not guilty or you may find some guilty and some not guilty. This 
depends on the facts as you find them and the inferences which you deem appropriate to draw from those charges. . . . An individual's membership in a conspiracy must be established by evidence as to his own conduct, what he, himself, 
knowingly said or did. . . . Now, there has been an issue raised that, even if - and it is, of course, denied there ever was a conspiracy - but it is 
contended that, even if one did exist, the Defendants or certain of them ceased to participate in any conspiratorial activity 
prior to December 27, 1968, and, therefore, cannot be found guilty, because they were not members of any conspiracy 
within the Statute of Limitations. . . . Now, in any trial, such as this one, with several Defendants, there is danger that a Defendant will not be judged solely upon 
the evidence applicable to him. In this regard, you must consider the evidence as to each Defendant separately. You have two questions to determine: First, whether there was a conspiracy to the character alleged in the indictment; and, 
second, if so, which of the Defendants, if any or all, were knowing participants in it.  This involves an examination of the 
evidence, separately, with respect to each Defendant. Now, in this instance - in this case, two of the Defendants are represented by one attorney. You still must examine the 
evidence as to each of those independently and reach your conclusion based on that evidence independently. Each 
defendant has the right to have you consider the evidence from his point of view - that is, you are to consider whether or not 
the evidence shows him individually guilty or not, and, unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of a 
Defendant, you must return a verdict of not guilty as to that individual. . . . In addition, you would not be warranted in finding any individual Defendant guilty, unless you find beyond a reasonable 
doubt that, knowing of the existence of the conspiracy, he took some action or authorized or directed the employment of 
one or more means and methods in furtherance of the conspiracy, as I explained to you earlier. Thus, the trial court never explicitly told the jury that participation in one of the allegedly conspiratorial subsidiary events was 
insufficient, without more, to support a verdict of guilty. "
415,13," The requested charge was as follows: Because the gist of the offense charged is a continuing agreement to raise, fix, maintain and stabilize prices of gypsum 
products, it is essential for you to determine what kind of agreement or understanding, if any, existed as to each defendant. 
Each defendant is chargeable with the acts of his or its fellow defendants and alleged co-conspirators only if the acts are 
done in furtherance of the joint venture as he or it understood it. No defendant is to be held responsible for what some of 
the alleged conspirators, unknown to the rest, do beyond the reasonable intendment of the common agreement or 
understanding, if any, to which you may find him or it a party. (Emphasis added)."
415,14," The trial court's comments were as follows: I will use them only for the purpose of my own guidance in my final charge, but they are just too late for me to pass on them 
as a supplemental request for charge, as for guidance of counsel. . . . (Emphasis added). The lateness the court mentions relates not to the submissions in general, but to the court's ability to rule on them that day so 
that counsel would be aware of the court's intent when making their closing arguments. "
416,15," The requested charge was as follows: Even if you find the existence of a conspiracy formed before December 27, 1968 and continuing thereafter you must acquit 
any defendant if it appears that he withdrew from such a conspiracy prior to the December 27, 1968 date. To withdraw from 
a conspiracy, a conspirator must take affirmative action. Resumption of competitive behavior, such as intensified price 
cutting or price wars, could constitute such affirmative action. If there is a reasonable doubt as to whether a defendant has 
withdrawn from the conspiracy charged, if any existed, prior to December 27, 1968, that defendant must be acquitted. (Emphasis added). This charge would not have told the jury ""that merely the fact that somebody was in competition shows withdrawal from 
conspiracy,"" as the trial court feared; instead, it merely recognized appellants' right to have the jury apply their theory of 
withdrawal if the jury believed their evidence and drew the inferences they asked the jury to draw. While not a model charge on 
this point, it at least drew the court's attention to the improperly narrow scope of the charge actually given. "

419,16," In his dissenting opinion, Judge Weis appears to emphasize the fact that, after the trial court's report to counsel, one of the 
defense lawyers ""suggested that the appropriate point [for declaration of a mistrial] would be the following morning [Tuesday, 
July 15]. . . ."" However, it is reasonable to assume that, had this attorney known of the extent of the jury deadlock or that the 
court had in no way dispelled the foreman's belief that the court wanted a definitive verdict ""one way or the other,"" he would have 
demanded an immediate mistrial."

420,18," Jenkins does differ somewhat from the case at bar, as there the defective charge was given only two hours after the inception 
of jury deliberations. However, the variance in timing between that case and ours would not appear to be significant. In both 
situations, the judge made it known to the jurors that he wanted a definitive verdict, a request that soon after was rewarded. In 
Jenkins, such a procedure was deemed to be reversible error."

420,21," While the district judge had assured counsel that he would give no instructions on the law during the conference, nor repeat 
the Fioravanti charge, in my view, the judge should have attempted to remedy the foreman's belief that only verdicts of guilty or 
acquittal were acceptable. If the judge felt constrained not to provide any legal instructions during the conference, because of the 
assurances afforded counsel, he could have summoned the jury and, in the presence of counsel, informed the jurors that no 
verdict was appropriate and, indeed, necessary should they be unable to reach unanimity. Here, however, the court failed to 
take any such steps. "

421,23, See Parts IIIB and C of Judge Hunter's opinion. 
422,1, The case is reported at 273 F. Supp. 18 (M.D. N.C. 1967). 
423,2," In Handler, Antitrust: 1969, 55 CORNELL L. REV. 161, 176 (1970), Professor Handler writes: ""A compact to exchange price 
information plainly should be unlawful without more if its purpose or effect was to stabilize prices."" He observed that in Container 
Corporation defendants had stressed Robinson-Patman as well as fraudulent conduct of the buyers as a defense, but Justice 
Douglas, author of the majority opinion, ""rejected these assertions out of hand."" In Kefauver, The Legality of Dissemination of Market Data by Trade Associations: What does Container Hold?  57 CORNELL L. 
REV. 777, 788 (1972), the author states: ""The majority in Container of course found an effect of price stabilization, but nothing in 
the opinion indicated that they had found a purpose on the part of defendants to achieve such an effect."" ""Container placed a 
new emphasis on the effect of competitors' exchange of market information."" Id. at 791. Professor Handler noted that a contrary 
result would promote evasion. Cf. Eaton, The Robinson-Patman Act: Reconciling the Meeting Competition Defense with the 
Sherman Act, 18 Antitrust Bull. 411, 427 (1973). (""There is however a great potential for abuse in any 'lying buyer' defense. Its 
applicability may therefore be somewhat limited."") A deliberate scheme to fix prices is, of course, illegal, even if unsuccessful, and in such a case the ""purpose"" of the defendants 
would be relevant to establish intent. "
424,3," These instructions were taken in large part from 1 E. DEVITT and C. BLACKMAR, FEDERAL JURY PRACTICE AND 
INSTRUCTIONS, Chapter 23, ANTITRUST-CONSPIRACY-CONTRACT IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE (2d ed. 1970). "
426,4," In view of the tenor of the motion, I see no significance in the fact that the trial judge did not report the foreman's belief that the 
jury was deadlocked. Indeed, the defense lawyers had moved for a mistrial on the previous day because of an allegedly hung 
jury. "
427,5," The problem engendered by a charge to the jury advising of its right to return ""no verdict"" is similar to that in which a criminal 
jury would be told that it may disregard the charge and acquit the defendant in spite of the law. While a jury does have such a 
right, the wisdom of such an instruction has been vigorously debated. See the opinion of Judge Sobeloff in United States v. 
Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 910, 25 L. Ed. 2d 91, 90 S. Ct. 908 (1970). Cf.  United States v. 
Alper, 449 F.2d 1223, 1233 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 988, 92 S. Ct. 1248, 31 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1972)."
427,6," After the jury returned its verdicts, it was polled several times and each juror unequivocally confirmed the findings of guilt. "
428,7," It is difficult to understand the defense' reluctance about allowing the jurors to return home since they had done so each 
evening during the months when testimony was being received. If there had been danger of damaging publicity or improper 
approaches to the jury, it would not have sprung into existence simply because deliberations had begun. "
436,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part: HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal…"" HN2[
] Separate corporate entities such as parent, and subsidiary, though under common ownership, can conspire together in 
violation of the Sherman Act. Perma Mufflers v. Int'l Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-42 (1968). "
437,2," It has been long established that these business relationships may violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 
U.S.C.  § 45, California Packing Corp., (1937); Mechanical Mfg. Co., 16 F.T.C. 67 (1932); Waugh Equip. Co., 15 F.T.C. 232

(S.D.N.Y. 1966). More recently, it has been held that the practice may be illegal under Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.

437,3," See e.g., United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 44-45 (1962). "
438,4," Another commentator has noted that reciprocal arrangements, unlike tie-ins, may even have certain economic virtues: ""It is even possible that buyers and sellers might deal with each other in a reciprocal basis in order to eliminate certain buying 
and selling expenses.  Transaction costs might possibly fall, for example, if reciprocity replaced such 'wasteful' forms of winning 
patronage as expensive entertainment."" Areeda, Antitrust Analysis, at 681 (2d ed. 1974)."
438,5," Moreover, in the absence of coercion it appears that a party-plaintiff to an allegedly illegal reciprocal agreement may be 
defeated by an in pari delicto or estoppel defense.  Perma Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., supra at 140; Columbia Nitrogen 
Corp. v. Royster Co., supra at 15-16. Such a claim has not been raised by defendants herein at this stage of the proceedings: "
441,6," Thus, the relevant portion of the complaint reads: ""In order to induce ISAB to forego the substantial initial and anticipated economic benefits of the competing and lower UOP bid, 
Exxon Research and its affiliate, Esso Italy, conspired to and did plan and agree to exploit their collective market power and 
upon information and belief did combine with Exxon to exploit the market position of Exxon and its subsidiaries to coerce ISAB 
into acceptance of the Exxon Research bid."" Complaint, [*] 12."
441,7," In reaching this conclusion, the court is fully cognizant of the ""liberal"" construction generally accorded antitrust pleadings, 
Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445 (1957). However, HN13[
] while it is now established that antitrust 
complaints need not be pleaded with greater specificity than an ordinary civil action, see Moore, Federal Practice [*] 8.17[3] (2d 
ed. 1975), their sufficiency must nonetheless pass muster under generally prevailing standards.  As measured against the 
general standard, this pleading is insufficient. "
444,8," Venue and jurisdictional considerations in private treble-damage actions involving individuals or unincorporated associations 
are governed by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 15, which provides for the initiation of such suits ""in the district in 
which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent."" "
445,9," Plaintiff does not cite 28 U.S.C.  § 1391 as a potential basis for venue here, and consequently it need not be determined here 
whether that statute provides a basis for venue over Italiana not encompassed in the special antitrust venue provisions.  See 
e.g., Brunette Mach. Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Ind., Inc., 406 U.S. 706 (1972)."
445,10," The court reaches this conclusion in spite of plaintiff's apparent, though possibly unintended, emphasis upon the ""may be 
found"" language of Section 12, see Plaintiff's Main Memorandum in Opposition at 30, because that criterion of venue/jurisdiction 
is generally equated with the narrower ""doing business"" standard: ""A number of courts have held that 'transacting business' is a looser and broader concept than 'doing business' under the other 
statutes, while the word 'found' is essentially equivalent to 'doing business'."" Flank Oil Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 277 F. Supp. 
357, 359 (D. Colo. 1967) (citations omitted). See also Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. American Radiator & Std. Sanitary Corp., 291 F. Supp. 252, 255 (E. D. Pa. 1968) (""The 
word 'found' within this provision of the Clayton Act connotes presence and continuous local activities within the district."") 
(emphasis added). "
446,11," Contrary authority relied upon by plaintiff does not, upon close analysis, support the proposition for which it is cited.Thus, in 
Gallen v. Howard D. Johnson Co., Inc., 1967 TRADE CASES [*] 72,149 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), the court premised jurisdiction here 
over nonresident defendants simply on the ground that they had performed acts in New York in connection with the matter in 
dispute such as to render them liable to our jurisdiction/venue. Despite some perplexing dictum, the case cannot be construed 
as holding that a subsidiary is present wherever its parent may be found, and, in fact, certain language in the decision may be 
read as specifically negating such a construction: ""My holding that the activities of the related complex in New York are sufficient to render the named defendants amenable to 
jurisdiction here is not a holding that the defendants are liable for the activities of other corporations in the complex controlled by 
Simon."" [*] 72,149 at 84,140. Similarly, in Country Maid, Inc. v. Haseotes, 299 F. Supp. 633(E.D. Pa. 1969), defendants were subjected to the 
venue/jurisdiction of a local court because of the court's finding that the various corporations were in essence a single company.  
No such averment is made with respect to the separate corporate identities of Exxon and Italiana.  The court further noted, ""The 
instant case is different from the parent-subsidiary cases in that there is no wholly-owning parent."" 299 F. Supp. at 637. "
447,12," Plaintiff, in its somewhat scattershot approach to this issue also remarks that ""ISAB has established an independent basis for 
jurisdiction over Esso Italy [Italiana] under the long-term provision of Section 302, New York Civil Practice Law & Rules"".  
Plaintiff's Main Memorandum in Opposition at 32.  The suggestion, however, must be rejected since plaintiff nowhere alleges 
that Italiana personally transacted business, committed a tortious act here, or committed a tortious act elsewhere which injured 
the plaintiff here.  It is also well to remember that tort jurisdiction, prescribed by state statutes, is generally irrelevant to 
determinations of jurisdiction or venue under the federal antitrust statutes.  Philadelphia Housing Auth. v. American Radiator & 
Std. Sanitary Corp., 291 F. Supp. 252, 260 (E.D. Pa. 1968). "
449,13," The fraud cause of action is set forth in the two following operative paragraphs of the complaint: ""30.  Defendants have subsequently asserted that Esso Italy did not have any intention of performing the obligations set forth in 
the Joint Agreement at the time that the terms of such Joint Agreement were communicated to ISAB and that the Joint 
Agreement was communicated and undertaken in the absence of or in excess of conferred authority. ""31.  If the commitments of Esso Italy, as part of the Joint Agreement, were at the time made, to the knowledge of defendants, 
made without authority as has been asserted by defendants, then defendants fraudulently induced ISAB to enter into the 
aforesaid Design and Engineering Contract and Licensing Agreement with Exxon Research at a higher cost than it would have 
paid to UOP by making false representations and promises that defendants intended and fully knew to be false when made, and 
which ISAB relied upon, to wit, defendants' commitment to use ISAB's projected refinery for put-through and processing of Esso 
Italy's and Exxon's crude oil and to give ISAB a preference on product exchanges."" "
450,14," In view of this disposition of the fraud aspect of the case, a number of potential jurisdictional questions in respect of Italiana 
present themselves.  Those issues are not ripe for adjudication now, but attention should be called to them nonetheless.  Given 
plaintiff's available options, the court foresees three potential combinations or permutations: ""(i) If the antitrust cause of action is successfully repleaded to include coercion and to establish venue/jurisdiction over Italiana, 
obviously Italiana will be held answerable here for the fraud count (regardless of the fruitfulness of plaintiff's renewed efforts to 
plead fraud against Exxon and ER&E) on the basis of pendent jurisdiction. ""(ii) Should the element of coercion be sufficiently averred in plaintiff's repleaded antitrust complaint, but venue/jurisdiction over 
Italiana not sustained, then the fraud cause of action will become inoperative as to Italiana, even assuming that Exxon and 
ER&E are repleaded back into the common law count.  Whether under these circumstances Italiana is an indispensable party to 
the maintenance of the fraud cause of action is a question which would have to be addressed in that eventuality. ""(iii) Finally, if coercion cannot be alleged in support of the reciprocal dealing claim, but jurisdiction over the foreign defendant 
established, the fraud prosecution would have to be dismissed since this court would lack subject matter jurisdiction (there being 
no federal question to which to append the common law count).  IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1015 (2d Cir. 1975); 
Calderone Enter. Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, supra at 1297; Walner v. Friedman, 410 F. Supp. 29, 33 (S.D.N.Y. 
1975). Diversity would not form a basis for ISAB's claim against Italiana, since both are Italian corporations.  Conceivably this 
court could have diversity jurisdiction of a fraud claim against Exxon and ER&E, if those defendants are satisfactorily repleaded 
into this aspect of the complaint.  However, the court notes that plaintiff does not in its complaint cite 28 U.S.C.  § 1332 as a 
ground for jurisdiction, and further that such an approach might be dismissible for lack of an indispensable party, or even on a 
forum non conveniens basis."" "
457,1," Plaintiffs joined as an additional cause of action violations of New Jersey antitrust laws, 56 N.J.S. § 9-1 et seq. In light of our 
disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to discuss the pendent state claim, which will remain for the trial court."
457,2," Defendant Irvine B. Johnstone is alleged to have violated FHLBB regulation 12 C.F.R. § 571.7(b) by simultaneously being a 
partner in Johnstone & O'Dwyer and a member of First Federal's board of directors."
457,3," Mortensens proposed an amended complaint to add as a defendant Guardian Abstract Company, a title insurance company 
they allege is controlled by Johnstone & O'Dwyer and which is alleged to receive approximately 75% of the fees Johnstone & 
O'Dwyer charge First Federal's mortgage buyers. Johnstone & O'Dwyer admit that they set up Guardian for federal income tax 
purposes."
457,4," Mortensens applied for a $43,000 mortgage; legal fees by Johnstone & O'Dwyer amounted to $540. Based on their sampling of 
First Federal's files, appellants contend that Johnstone & O'Dwyer's fees for these mortgage-related services are ""artificially 
pegged to the cost of the real estate purchased with a minimum fee of $375 and a maximum fee of $550."" Brief of Appellant at 7."
457,5," What appellants do try to argue is that because it is a mortgage the loan is ""unique"": "
458,," . . . Approval by [First Federal] of the loan application . . .  satisfies the mortgage contingency provisions of most residential 
real estate purchase agreements. Thus, the applicant is ordinarily obligated to consummate the purchase on the residential 
real estate under contract. Brief of Appellant at 16."
458,6," We take note of the recently enacted New Jersey statute that may have ended the ""closed attorneys"" plan, 46 N.J. S. 10A-6, 
133 A.2d 688, (effective Jan. 7, 1976)."
458,7," First Federal's Statement of Condition dated December 31, 1972 indicates some $9,000,000 in advances from FHLBB for 
residential mortgages. On December 31, 1974, the figure was $8,100,000."
458,8," For instance, the minutes of First Federal's board of directors' meeting dated February 19, 1976, list under ""mortgages granted"" 
three mortgages insured by Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
458,9," Appellants examined twenty-eight loan files representing every 75th file during the four-year period prior to suit; of those 
twenty-eight, seven applications were initiated by out-of-state residents. During oral argument appellants mentioned that ""several"" closings took place out-of-state. "
459,10," Johnstone & O'Dwyer allegedly ""turn over"" 75% of its mortgage related legal fees to their title company, Guardian."
459,11," At one point plaintiffs' attorney remarked ""We are here on a motion for class action determination."" A hearing on the class 
action motion had been scheduled for January, 1975, but was then postponed to coincide with the hearing on defendants' 
motions. Plaintiffs' attorney seemed unsure of the nature of the attack that would be made by defendants, saying ""I am not really 
going to try to answer at this point the motion for summary judgment. I would like to reserve that for rebuttal."""
459,12," Forrest v. Capital Bldg. & Loan Ass'n, 385 F. Supp. 831 (M.D. La. 1973), aff'd, 504 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 
U.S. 978, 44 L. Ed. 2d 470, 95 S. Ct. 1980 (1975). The Fifth Circuit affirmed a holding on the merits - that there was but a single 
product. Neither it nor the district court dealt with the jurisdictional issue, even though a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction 
was before the district court. Because a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction attacks the power of a court to enter any ruling on the merits, 
the jurisdictional issue is generally decided prior to the entry of judgment on the merits. In Forrest the district court said it would 
consider two of the claims on the merits (one being the single product issue) and that a treatment of those issues on the merits 
would ""moot the need"" to treat the jurisdictional issue. 385 F. Supp. at 835. Thus Forrest provides no illumination on our 
jurisdictional issue. "

Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 71-72, 83 L. Ed. 1111, 59 S. Ct. 725 (1939). That the district court is free to determine facts relevant 
to its jurisdiction has long been clear. See, e.g., Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 42 L. Ed. 682, 18 S. Ct. 293 (1898)."
462,17, A factual jurisdictional proceeding cannot occur until plaintiff's allegations have been controverted.
462,18," In Doctors, Inc. v. Blue Cross, 490 F.2d 48 (3d Cir. 1973), the defendant had filed a 12(b)(1) motion prior to filing an answer, 
so plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegations were entitled to a presumption of truthfulness. The district court in Doctors dismissed the 
complaint; on appeal we reversed, finding sufficient allegations of interstate impact to confer subject matter jurisdiction, taking 
plaintiff's allegations as true. The other Sherman Act case in our circuit implicating Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) did not in fact turn on subject matter jurisdiction. In 
Winkleman v. New York Stock Exchange, 445 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1971), the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint. 
The only such motion by defendant was a 12(b)(1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction motion. It was apparent on appeal, 
however, that the district court had actually considered the motion as made under Rule 56.  445 F.2d at 788. Because plaintiffs 
were given no opportunity to argue or brief the motion to dismiss, we reversed. As stated by Judge Adams, in American Motor "
463,," Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 (3d Cir. 1975): ""One of the most basic tenets of American jurisprudence is that 
procedural fairness requires that each party have notice of the issues involved and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful 
time and in a meaningful manner."" Id. at 1244. We do have some concern, in the present case, that appellants did not have this 
opportunity. Our most recent Sherman case, Evans v. S. S. Kresge Company, 544 F.2d 1184 (3d Cir. 1976), did involve a dismissal for want 
of subject matter jurisdiction, but one granted on a motion for summary judgment, since both parties agreed there were no 
issues of material fact. Thus, a stage in pretrial discovery and other proceedings had thus been reached where all the relevant 
facts were agreed upon. Apart from Sherman Act claims, though, we have frequently had the opportunity to discuss the proper standards for dismissals 
under Rule 12(b)(1). For example, in dealing with dismissals for lack of diversity jurisdiction, we have said that if the plaintiff ""fails 
to bring forth any factual material to support his claim to jurisdiction, then dismissal may properly be granted against him. 
However, it should clearly appear from the record that plaintiff has had an opportunity to present facts . . . that diversity was not 
manufactured."" Groh v. Brooks, 421 F.2d 589, 594 (3d Cir. 1970). See also Tanzymore v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 457 F.2d 1320 
(3d Cir. 1972); Nelson v. Keefer, 451 F.2d 289 (3d Cir. 1971). We have also discussed 12(b)(1) dismissals in non-diversity 
cases. In Local 336, American Federation of Musicians, AFL-CIO v. Bonatz, 475 F.2d 433 (3d Cir. 1973), we reversed the 
dismissal of a complaint that requested enforcement of an arbitration award. There, during argument on a motion for summary 
judgment, the court raised sua sponte the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Judge Gibbons wrote that while the trial court does 
have significant latitude in determining matters of its own jurisdiction, we have never departed from the rule that even on such an issue the record must clearly establish that after jurisdiction 
was challenged the plaintiff had an opportunity to present facts by affidavit or by deposition, or in an evidentiary hearing, in 
support of his jurisdictional contention. Id. at 437. See also Lasher v. Shafer, 460 F.2d 343 (3d Cir. 1972) (Civil Rights Act claim). "
464,19," The discussion on appeal was somewhat spontaneous as the district court had entered a judgment on the merits, under Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The appellate court said it was confirming that the district court had jurisdiction. The hesitancy of some district courts to confront this tricky jurisdictional issue is also exemplified in the one case, also in the 
Fifth Circuit, that dealt with a claim on the merits quite similar to the one sub judice, Forrest v. Capital Buildings & Loan 
Association, 504 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 978, 44 L. Ed. 2d 470, 95 S. Ct. 1980 (1975). In Forrest, 
defendant did make a 12(b)(1) motion but the trial court skipped to a decision against plaintiff on the merits, saying the 
jurisdictional issue was therefore moot.  385 F. Supp. at 835, aff'd, 504 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1974)."
464,20," In Gough, supra, the same court reversed a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction that was based on the jury's finding of insufficient 
effect on interstate commerce. The Ninth Circuit held it error to submit the jurisdictional issue to the jury, and, again, the court 
explained the separateness of the merits issue and the jurisdictional one. Thus the Ninth Circuit's approach to the interrelation of Sherman Act claims' merit and their jurisdictional prerequisite differs 
greatly from that in the other circuits discussed. The Fourth Circuit, in Hospital, supra, preferred to treat a Sherman motion to 
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as a motion on the merits under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  511 F.2d at 680-81 (""better"" to treat an 
insufficient plea of effect on interstate commerce as a failure to state a claim). As early as McBeath, supra, the Fifth Circuit held that the factual issues on the merits in a Sherman Act claim are inseparable 
from the factual issues on the jurisdictional question. As a result, the court held that plaintiff should be given full trial 
opportunities to establish those facts, rather than having the trial court evaluate jurisdiction at a more usual early stage under 
Rule 12(b)(1). An even more intriguing approach is one described, but not adopted, in Finis P. Ernest, Inc., supra, by the Seventh Circuit: 
where a per se violation (such as price-fixing) is alleged the court could skip the usual ""in or affecting commerce"" jurisdictional 
test. This view implicitly equates the interstate nexus required for jurisdiction with that required for success on the merits. For 
cases so holding within the Seventh Circuit see U.S. Dental Inst. v. American Ass'n of Orth., 396 F. Supp. 565 (N.D.  Ill. 1975) "
465,," (can determine jurisdiction better after all evidence is in; for 12(b)(1) court should assume jurisdiction exists unless effect on 
interstate commerce is clearly non-existent); Mar-Farr Corp. v. Copley Press, Inc., 64 F.R.D. 456 (N.D. Ill. 1974) (should not 
grant 12(b)(1) when unsure of effect on interstate commerce). Because those effects need not be proven for success on the 
merits, the facile conclusion is that ""it may be anomalous to require proof of effects to satisfy jurisdiction in those cases where 
proof of effects is not necessary to establish the substantive offense."" 509 F.2d at 1259 (emphasis added). Even a leading 
antitrust commentator poses that question. See P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis, para 183 at 122 (2d ed. 1974). This seems to 
ignore the constitutional requirement of jurisdiction entirely."
465,21," The Court has, however, faced related issues several times.  In United States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Ass'n, 336 U.S. 
460, 464, 93 L. Ed. 805, 69 S. Ct. 714 (1949), the nexus of interstate commerce necessary to success on the merits had been 
found insufficient after a trial. The Court reversed, because the trial court had not considered whether the intrastate conduct 
could have had sufficient interstate effects. A dismissal of a Sherman Act complaint for failure to state a cause of action was reversed in United States v. Employing 
Plasterers, 347 U.S. 186, 98 L. Ed. 618, 74 S. Ct. 452 (1954). The trial court had found ""no allegation of fact which showed that 
these powerful local restraints had a sufficiently adverse effect on the flow of plastering materials into Illinois."" 347 U.S. at 188. 
The Supreme Court disagreed: The complaint plainly charged several times that the effect of all these local restraints was to restrain interstate commerce. 
Whether these charges be called ""allegations of fact"" or ""mere conclusions of the pleader,"" we hold that they must be taken 
into account in deciding whether the Government is entitled to have its case tried. . . . It goes too far to say that the Government could not possibly produce enough evidence to show that these local 
restraints caused unreasonable burdens on [interstate commerce]. Id. at 188-89. A grant of summary judgment for defendants was reversed in Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 7 L. 
Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), not only because the plaintiff should be viewed favorably in any summary judgment but also 
because summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the 
proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot. It is only when the witnesses 
are present and subject to cross-examination that their credibility and the weight to be given their testimony can be 
appraised. Trial by affidavit is no substitute for trial by jury which so long has been the hallmark of ""even handed justice."" Id. at 472-73. When the trial court in a non-jury trial found defendant's interstate nexus insufficient on the merits, the Supreme Court reversed 
in a brief per curiam in Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 19 L. Ed. 2d 554, 88 S. Ct. 443 (1967), finding the requisite nexus because 
the intrastate territorial division ""almost surely resulted in fewer sales to retailers - hence fewer purchases from out-of-state 
distillers . . . ."" Id. at 322. In the current leading tie-in case, Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 
1252 (1969), the Court again reversed the grant of summary judgment for defendants. The Supreme Court explained that not 
only had the district court misunderstood the legal principles on the merits, it had also ""misconceived the extent of its authority to "
466,," evaluate the evidence in ruling on this motion for summary judgment."" Id. at 499. The Court then quoted from Poller, supra, that 
summary procedures should be used sparingly in antitrust litigation. Although it did not involve a tie-in claim, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975), 
did concern the interstate nexus sufficient to support jurisdiction. The trial court in Goldfarb conducted a hearing on the issue of 
liability during which it disposed of defendant's ""defense"" of insufficient effect on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court 
agreed, that the alleged intrastate restraint ""may substantially affect commerce."" Id. at 785 (emphasis added)."
466,22," The appellate court, finding ambiguity in whether the court below had granted dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or 
12(b)(6), regarded the dismissal as having been under 12(b)(6). As a general rule if there is a jurisdictional defect as well as an 
insufficiency on the merits, the correct procedure is to treat a dismissal as having been on the jurisdictional ground for the 
obvious reason that if the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case then a fortiori it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the merits."
466,23, The Court's footnote 5 reads as follows:
466,5," . It may of course be that even though petitioner's complaint adequately alleges an effect on interstate commerce, further 
proceedings in this case will demonstrate that respondents' conduct in fact involves no violation of law, or indeed no 
substantial effect on interstate commerce. Cf.  United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 96 L. Ed. 978, 
72 S. Ct. 690 (1952). "
467,24," See Evans v. S. S. Kresge Co., supra at 7, n.15."
467,25," On the other hand, the conduct at issue in Goldfarb was one step removed from the lending institution, which is not the case 
here."
467,26," Still, we hesitate to conclude that all restraints would confer subject matter jurisdiction. Two cases that we specifically 
approved in Doctors, supra, as properly holding the conduct to be without the reach of Sherman can be distinguished on the first 
consideration. In Lieberthal v. North Country Lanes, 332 F.2d 269 (2d Cir. 1964) plaintiff's allegations were uncontested, thus 
giving the plaintiff the benefit of those and their favorable inferences - questions of disputed fact did not arise.  In Page v. Work, 
290 F.2d 323 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 875, 7 L. Ed. 2d 76, 82 S. Ct. 121 (1961), plaintiff was given that advantage, since 
the court treated it as a Rule 56 motion, and the additional one of having the jurisdictional issue decided after a trial on the 
merits. "
468,27," We distinguish United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 (1947), where the Court held 
the Chicago cabs not brought within interstate commerce merely because interstate travelers used the local cabs, on the 
grounds that the home mortgages here are an essential part of a customer's move into New Jersey. See Goldfarb, supra, at 784 
n.13."
468,28," For example, the trial court acknowledged that competition for title certification might be interstate, but discounted this 
possibility because ""plaintiffs have shown neither that this type of competition exists, nor, assuming it does, that its volume is 
greater than de minimis."" Appendix at 285a. See also Battle v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co., 493 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1110, 42 L. Ed. 2d 
807, 95 S. Ct. 784 (1975); Brett v. First Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n, 461 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir. 1972). The district court relied on 
Spens v. Citizens Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n, 364 F. Supp. 1161 (N.D. Ill. 1973), saying: ""Facts identical with those under 
discussion, i.e., an allegedly unlawful tie-in involving credit imposed by a single institution without market power, compelled 
dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act [in Spens]."" Appendix at 290a (emphasis added). But 
in Spens, although the court dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 without specifying any section of Rule 12, it is apparent that the 
dismissal was granted under Rule 12(b)(6). The court said plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action because they had 
alleged neither a conspiracy nor, under Fortner, any market power. "
470,29," Appellants rely on California v. Federal Power Commission, 369 U.S. 482, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54, 82 S. Ct. 901 (1961), but in that 
case the FPC granted a merger application while the legality of that proposed merger was the subject of a Clayton Act § 7 suit in 
federal court. The holding was bottomed on the immense practical difficulties of unscrambling such a merger. Here there would 
be relatively simple changes at most."
470,30," Nor will it be binding in considering the regulation itself.  An appeal from the agency would lie in our court, 12 U.S.C. § 
1464(d)(7)(B), but assuming the FHLBB here were to rule that the conduct did amount to a tie prohibited by its regulations, 
Mortensens could then come back to the district court. In that case, the fact that the agency prohibited the conduct, while not 
determinative on the antitrust issue, could be given appropriate weight by the district court in resolving the antitrust claim."
470,31," Congress has given the FHLBB the power to prescribe rules and regulations governing the organization and operation of 
federal savings and loan institutions.  12 U.S.C. § 1464(a). For procedures governing hearings before the FHLBB, see 12 U.S.C. 
§ 1464(d). If the FHLBB declines to act, then plaintiffs may return to district court. See Milberg v. Lawrence Cedarhurst Federal 
Savings & Loan, 496 F.2d 523 (2d Cir. 1974). "

the plaintiff did not receive any direct injury from the alleged illegal acts of the defendant. No conspiracy or combination against

the fact that PE was not qualified for certain projects (primarily because of the expense of the testing) did give AMPOT a 
significant head start in its market share. "
528,6," The court's opinion demonstrates excessive concern with preventing the appearance of monopoly even if it requires defiance of 
the realities of the market situation. The same prices and other competitive practices which were found legal so long as there

makes no provision for the natural demise of an industry due to changes in consumer desires. HN3[

industry's excess capacity and of the methods used in A/P production."

applied by a United States district court in passing on a motion for summary judgment in a civil antitrust action."" 394 U.S., at 496. 
Petitioners do not ask us to re-examine Fortner I, which left only the economic power question open on the issue of whether a 
per se violation could be proved.  On the other hand, Fortner has not pursued the suggestion in Fortner I that it might be able to 
prove a § 1 violation under the rule-of-reason standard.  394 U.S., at 500. Thus, with respect to § 1, only the economic-power 
issue is before us. LEdHN[1B][
] [1B]LEdHN[2B][
] [2B]In Fortner I, the Court noted that Fortner also alleged a § 2 violation, namely, that petitioners ""conspired together for the purpose of.: acquiring a monopoly in the market for prefabricated houses."" 394 U.S., at 
500. The District Court held that a § 2 violation had been proved.  Although the Court of Appeals did not reach this issue, a 
remand is unnecessary.  It is clear that neither the District Court's findings of fact nor the record supports the conclusion that § 2 
was violated.  The District Court found only that ""the defendants did combine or conspire to increase sales of prefabricated 
house packages by United States Steel Corporation by the making of loans to numerous builders containing the tie-in provision"" 
and that ""the sole purpose of the loan programs of the Credit Corporation was specifically and deliberately to increase the share 
of the market of United States Steel Corporation in prefabricated house packages…."" App. 1603 (emphasis added).  But 
""increasing sales"" and ""increasing market share"" are normal business goals, not forbidden by § 2 without other evidence of an 
intent to monopolize.  The evidence in this case does not bridge the gap between the District Court's findings of intent to 
increase sales and its legal conclusion of conspiracy to monopolize.  Moreover, petitioners did not have a large market share or 
dominant market position.  See n. 3, infra. No inference of intent to monopolize can be drawn from the fact that a firm with a 
small market share has engaged in nonpredatory competitive conduct in the hope of increasing sales.  Yet as we conclude, 
infra, at 621-622, that is all the record in this case shows. "

prefabricated home manufacturers, the largest of which sold 16,804 homes in that year.  In the following year the Home 
Division's sales declined while the sales of each of its four principal competitors remained steady or increased. "

sales in 1960 were made to dealers receiving financial assistance from the Credit Corp.  See id., at 1589-1590."
547,6, The prime rate at the time was 5% or 5 1/2%. 
548,7," See Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L.J. 19 (1957)."
548,8," See e.g., United Shoe Machinery v. United States, 258 U.S. 451; International Business Machines v. United States, 298 U.S. 
131; International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392. In his article in the 1969 Supreme Court Review, 16, Professor Dam 
suggests that this kind of leverage may also have been present in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1."
548,9," Fortner's expert witness agreed with the statement: ""The amount of the loan as a percentage of the collateral or security is only one element in determining its advantage to a 
borrower.  The other relevant factors include the rate of interest charged, whether the lender discounts the amount loaned or 
charges service for [sic] other fees and maturity in terms of repayment."" App. 1686."
548,10," Relying on Advance Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F. 2d 55 (CA4 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920, 
Fortner contends that acceptance of the package by a significant number of customers is itself sufficient to prove the seller's 
economic power.  But this approach depends on the absence of other explanations for the willingness of buyers to purchase the 
package. See 415 F. 2d, at 68. In the Northern Pacific case, for instance, the Court explained: ""The very existence of this host of tying arrangements is itself compelling evidence of the defendant's great power, at least 
where, as here, no other explanation has been offered for the existence of these restraints.  The 'preferential routing' clauses 
conferred no benefit on the purchasers or lessees.  While they got the land they wanted by yielding their freedom to deal with 
competing carriers, the defendant makes no claim that it came any cheaper than if the restrictive clauses had been omitted.  In 
fact any such price reduction in return for rail shipments would have quite plainly constituted an unlawful rebate to the shipper.  
So far as the Railroad was concerned its purpose obviously was to fence out competitors, to stifle competition."" 356 U.S., at 7-8 
(footnote omitted). As this passage demonstrates, this case differs from Northern Pacific because use of the tie-in in this case can be explained as 
a form of price competition in the tied product, whereas that explanation was unavailable to the Northern Pacific Railway. "
549,11," The Court in Northern Pacific concluded that the railroad ""possessed substantial economic power by virtue of its extensive 
landholdings"" and then described those holdings as follows: ""As pointed out before, the defendant was initially granted large acreages by Congress in the several North-western States 
through which its lines now run.  This land was strategically located in checkerboard fashion amid private holdings and within 
economic distance of transportation facilities.  Not only the testimony of various witnesses but common sense makes it evident 
that this particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business 
activities."" Id., at 7."
549,12," ""Since one of the objectives of the patent laws is to reward uniqueness, the principle of these cases was carried over into 
antitrust law on the theory that the existence of a valid patent on the tying product, without more, establishes a distinctiveness 
sufficient to conclude that any tying arrangement involving the patented product would have anticompetitive consequences."" 
United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 46."
549,13," ""Accordingly, the proper focus of concern is whether the seller has the power to raise prices, or impose other burdensome 
terms such as a tie-in, with respect to any appreciable number of buyers within the market."" 394 U.S., at 504. Professor Dam correctly analyzed the burden of proof imposed on Fortner by this language.  In his article in the 1969 Supreme 
Court Review, 25-26, he reasoned: ""One important question in interpreting the Fortner decision is the meaning of this language.  Taken out of context, it might be 
thought to mean that, just as the 'host of tying arrangements' was 'compelling evidence' of 'great power' in Northern Pacific, so 
the inclusion of tie-in clauses in contracts with 'any appreciable numbers of buyers' establishes market power.  But the passage 
read in context does not warrant this interpretation.  For the immediately preceding sentence makes clear that market power in 
the sense of power over price must still exist.  If the price could have been raised but the tie-in was demanded in lieu of the 
higher price, then -- and presumably only then -- would the requisite economic power exist.  Thus, despite the broad language 
available for quotation in later cases, the treatment of the law on market power is on close reading not only consonant with the 
precedents but in some ways less far-reaching than Northern Pacific and Loew's, which could be read to make actual market 
power irrelevant."" (Footnotes omitted.) "
550,15," The opinion of the Court in Fortner I notes that smaller companies might not have the ""financial strength to offer credit 
comparable to that provided by larger competitors under tying arrangements."" 394 U.S., at 509. Fortner's expert witness was 
unaware of the financing practices of competing sellers of prefabricated homes, App. 1691-1692, but there is nothing to suggest 
that they were unable to offer comparable financing if they chose to do so. "
558,1," We mention in passing that Title I of that act (18 U.S.C. 3331-3334) provides for special grand juries under certain conditions.  
We find no merit in the argument by counsel for some defendants that an indictment for violation of Title IX can be returned only 
by a Title I special grand jury if such a special grand jury is in existence.  We are convinced that any duly constituted federal 
grand jury can indict for any federal crime. "
559,2," We interpret HN2[
] subsection (d), like the Sherman Act, as punishing ""the conspiracies at which it is aimed on the common 
law footing"" and not requiring an overt act.  Nash v. U.S., 229 U.S. 373, 378, 33 S. Ct. 780, 782, 57 L. Ed. 1232 (1913). 
Otherwise it would be otiose, as merely repetitious of the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371. If Section 1962(d) were 
interpreted as requiring an overt act, the allegations of the indictments are insufficient to meet such a requirement."
559,3," Economic analysts distinguish between ""market structure"" and ""market behavior"", and scrutinize each separately.  See U.S. v. 
General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 497, 94 S. Ct. 1186, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1974); Carl Kaysen and Donald F. Turner,

560,5," In ordinary speech the expression ""commercial bribery"" is often used where the delinquent party (such as a purchasing agent

561,7," Conversely, a search is not illegal because it turns out to be a ""dry hole"" or a ""water haul."" One counsel at argument contended 
that the confidential informant mentioned in the affidavit was not reliable, because only one date was charged in the indictment 
whereas the informant described offenses over a longer period of time.  This contention is also unfounded because the 
government is not obliged to indict a defendant for every offense of which it has some evidence. "

608,9," The nature of the project is described in the following excerpts from the Plan which is filed in and a part of the record of this 
case: ""* * * The sentencing purposes of the project are punishment, rehabilitation, and a sensible utilization of the time and 
activities of the defendants in lieu of the talent and time waste that sitting in jail, doing nothing constructive, turns out to be.  The 
offense for which the defendants are sentenced is a misdemeanor for which jail sentences normally are given and not sentences 
to prisons where there are useful programs of time and talent usage.  The product of the project is a reduction of the incidence of 
recidivism in ex-offenders due to unemployment * * * * It is intended that the project become a permanent service agency within 
the Probation Department of the Court, and that role to be played by these defendants will be that of developing the plan of the 
project, carrying out its functions through its initial stages and leaving it as a permanent structure to be carried on by others.  The 
Chief Probation Officer and select members of his staff, as supervising probation officers of the defendants, will leave the 
detailed development of the plan to the defendants.  They will serve principally as resource persons, and as recorders will "
609,," document the experience and accomplishments of the Project.  Since part of the plan is the development of the project itself, this 
proposal of the project is not in detail but in general terms.  The details of the project, its procedures and programs, consistent 
with the general outline herein, shall be the responsibility of the defendants and their successors * * * * [The] first Chairman of 
the Project, shall determine and direct the project assignments of the other defendants who are now and later may be assigned 
to the Project.  The Chief Probation Officer shall furnish facilities, equipment and supplies for the offices of the Project * * * * The 
proposed alternative sentence program is designed to help deal with the problems faced by the ex-offender in finding and 
keeping full-time employment and to assist the U.S.  Probation Office in enhancing the role it plays in the solution of those 
problems * * * * Through orientation, education, and personal involvement, the Defendants would first be required to become 
knowledgeable about the problems of employment and the ex-offender * * * * The Defendants would be responsible for 
surveying and cataloguing the various social agency and philanthropic group services which have programs which might help 
solve the problems of ex-offender employment * * * * Through experience and knowledge * * * the Defendants would recruit the 
assistance of management * * * in making available to the U.S.  Probation Office existing industry training programs for the 
training of ex-offenders * * * * [The] Defendants in such a program, using their management skills and abilities and knowledge of 
Chicago metropolitan area industries, would serve as a model of what can be accomplished in both articulating and solving 
some portion of the problems of employment for ex-offenders * * * * No meaningful solution to the problem of employment for ex-
offenders can be found without an in-depth exposure to the variety of problems the ex-offender faces as well as the problems 
the U.S.  Probation Office faces in helping to secure training and jobs for those under its supervision * * * * The ultimate solution 
of ex-offender rehabilitation through meaningful employment is through accommodation and adaptation of existing training and 
employment facilities to the special needs of the ex-offender rather than training programs designed exclusively for ex-offenders. 
If this be true, marshaling the rich resources of existing industrial training and placement programs must be in large part the 
solution to many problems the U.S.  Probation Office has in securing appropriate jobs and job training for persons under its 
supervision and responsibility.  Although there is ever a crying need, some kind of job, no matter how menial, is almost always 
available for the ex-offender. It is not just any job but a job which fits the abilities and potential of the ex-offender that can make 
the difference in keeping him at work and not back in prison. Job training and job upgrading are the critical problems in 
rehabilitation for the ex-offender * * * * If the model is successful, industry could well come to consider making training facilities, 
and thus job opportunities, available to ex-offenders in addition and as a part of industry's financial and manpower support of 
community and social services."" "
610,1," P. 8, October 9, 1974 Address by William B. Saxbe before Legal Committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of America."
610,2, These cases are collected in Appendix A. 
611,3, The incarceration imposed in the Electrical Equipment and Plumbing Fixtures cases is set forth in Appendix B. 
612,5," The length of participation as to five individuals is stated to be ""indeterminate."" Evidence presented to the Grand Jury but not 
referred to during the sentencing hearings would more precisely identify these defendants' length of participation.  The 
Government will not refer to this evidence, however, since the defendants were not confronted with it. "
615,1," According to the indictment ( § 9), the offense was terminated ""sometime prior to December, 1974,"" more than a year before 
the indictment was returned.  In December, 1974, Congress enacted the ""Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act of 1974,"" which 
amended the Sherman Act to make a violation of the Act a felony (rather than a misdemeanor as before) and to increase 
substantially the maximum penalties.  However, since the present indictment relates to conduct which terminated before the 
amendment, the amendment is inapplicable.  As a result, the offense charged by the indictment is a misdemeanor and the 
punishment cannot exceed a $50,000 fine and a one-year jail sentence. "
616,2," For example, although the present indictment alleges that the annual commerce involved was approximately $1 billion, the 
indictment in the United States Steel case (Blue Book No. 1796) alleged a continuing price-fixing conspiracy involving annual 
sales of $3.6 billion of carbon steel products.  Yet the Government neither opposed nolo pleas in that case nor sought jail 
sentences.Judge Weinfeld, who imposed sentences in that case, is widely regarded as one of the most outstanding judges in 
the country and a strong supporter of the antitrust laws; yet Judge Weinfeld did not impose any jail sentences. Similarly, the United States Gypsum case (Blue Book No. 2356), involved a continuing price-fixing conspiracy involving annual 
sales of over $4 billion.  The six corporate defendants had been previously convicted of fixing prices on the same product and 
were subject to a court decree entered in 1951 prohibiting such activity.  Thus, the defendants were charged not only with a 
criminal statutory violation but criminal contempt as well.  Yet none of the ten individuals indicted in Gypsum - neither those who 
pleaded nolo nor those who were convicted after a six months trial - were incarcerated; all individual defendants were given 
suspended sentences. American Optical (Blue Book No. 1620) is particularly significant since it not only involved hundreds of millions of dollars of 
commerce in a product (eyeglasses) directly sold to millions of consumers, but also involved actual coercion of independent 
manufacturers and independent distributors whose business lives were extinquished or threatened with extinction.  Judge 
Gignoux, on whom the Division relies extensively in its memorandum (pp. 6-7), and whom Assistant Attorney General Baker 
relied on in his oral argument (Transcript, October 5, 1976, p. 56), sentenced the individual defendants who pleaded nolo. No jail 
sentences were imposed. See also, e.g., American Oil (Blue Book No. 1849), involving $720 million annual sales of gasoline; California and Hawaiian 
Sugar (Blue Book Nos. 2427, 2429, 2430), involving $542 million annual sales of sugar; Anaconda American Brass (Blue Book 
No. 1711), involving $360 million annual sales of brass mill products; Archer Daniels-Midland (Blue Book No. 1800), involving 
$305 million annual sales of bakery flour. "

Supplements). "
619,4," Thus, in the Dunham Concrete case, the first case referred to in the Antitrust Division's Appendix A, ""the jury convicted the 
defendants of attempting to monopolize trade in concrete products and violating the labor racketeering provisions of the Hobbs 
Act through strikes, work stoppages and physical violence."" (Blue Book No. 2052, emphasis added.) In Kansas City Music Operators Assn., the second case referred to in Appendix A, the indictment to which defendants pleaded 
nolo contendere ""charged that the defendants and co-conspirators used threats, coercion, and persuasion to prevent and 
attempt to prevent vending machine operators from soliciting locations of other vending machine operators or from expanding 
their vending machine business."" (Blue Book No. 2090, emphasis added.) Similarly, in Metro Denver Concrete, the third case referred to in Appendix A, non-conspirators were told they would be put out 
of business if they did not join the conspiracy, and below-cost prices were offered to a non-conspirator's customers for the 
purpose of driving him out of business.  (Blue Book No. 2124.) The indictment in Molasky (Blue Book No. 2345), another case listed in Appendix A, charged that the defendants induced 
wholesalers to sell their business by threatening to put them out of business or otherwise to injure them economically. The plumbing fixtures cases, referred to in Appendix B to the Division's memorandum, involved hard-core price fixing by 
companies which had been convicted twice previously for price fixing of the same product.  See United States v. Trenton 
Potteries, 273 U.S. 392 (1927) (in which imposition of actual jail sentences was affirmed by the Supreme Court and 
subsequently suspended by the District Court), and Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, 226 U.S. 20 (1912)."
619,5," The fact that defendants have pleaded nolo and saved the Court and the judicial system an expensive and time-consuming trial 
(even assuming such a trial could be manageable) is a factor which the Court should take into account in sentencing in this 
case.  See, e.g., Comment § 1.8(a)(1) of American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty: ""A defendant who enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may substantially contribute to the promptness of his punishment.  If 
a plea of not guilty were entered, the case would have to be placed upon the trial calendar for trial at a later date; if the docket is 
crowded or the preparation is complex or essential participants are unavailable, a substantial interval of time may elapse before 
trial.  In some cases the mere trial of the case would itself consume a considerable period of time.  If a defendant by his plea 
makes avoidance of these delays possible, it is not inconsistent with the objectives of the system to grant charge or sentence 
concessions."
619,*," * * ""The granting of charge and sentence concessions would likewise be proper in such circumstances, for the defendant who has 
decided to forego his chances of acquittal (which exist to some degree in almost every case) has thereby made a sufficient 
contribution to the certainty of punishment to justify some dimunition in the degree of punishment. ""Thus, a defendant who by his plea has made his punishment swift and certain is deserving of charge or sentence concessions 
as a result."" See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 752 (1970). "
620,7," Other members of the Committee included various distinguished members of the bar and legal education (Professor Herbert 
Wechsler of Columbia University and C. Clyde Ferguson, Jr., then Dean of the Howard University School of Law), and the 
judiciary, including United States District Judges Theodore B. Knudson (Minneapolis), Edwin M. Stanley (Middle District North 
Carolina) and Luther W. Youngdahl (District of Columbia)."
620,8," Similarly, Standard 2.2 provides: ""General principle: judicial discretion.  The sentence imposed in each case should call for the 
minimum amount of custody or confinement which is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense and 
the rehabilitative needs of the defendant."" See also Simon, Needed: A New Look at Punishments, 62 A.B.A.J. 1297 (1976). "
621,9," Indeed, Judge Garrity explicitly states: ""The reason for the sentence of the Court is simply the word cocaine."" United States v. 
Foss, 501 F. 2d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1974)."
621,10," See also the recent comment by Judge Walter Hoffman: ""If defendant is a first offender and the offense is not a violent crime, 
the chances for probation are excellent."" Hoffman, Pleas of Guilty in the Federal Courts, 22 The Practical Lawyer (No. 6) 11, 12 
(1976)."
621,11," Furthermore, although grand juries returned 34 and 35 criminal cases in fiscal 1974 and 1975, they returned 38 cases in 
calendar 1962.  Thus, according to the Division's logic, the amount of price fixing in the economy has decreased since 1962 
even though jail sentences have been very rare during that period. "
622,12," The results of scientific tests attempting to measure the effectiveness of punishment as a general deterrent have been 
conflicting and offer unreliable support to the general deterrent theory.  See Andenaes, General Prevention Revisited, 66 J. 
Crim. Law and Criminology 338 (1975); Zimring and Hawkins, Deterrence: The Legal Threat In Crime Control (1973), pp. 8-50, 
for a discussion of some of these various positions. "
623,13," This document strikingly illustrates the wisdom of the principle stated in the American Bar Association Standards Relating to 
Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures ( § 5.3(c)) that, ""Although there will be occasions when sentencing recommendations 
by the prosecutor are appropriate, the prosecutor ordinarily should not make any specific recommendations as to the appropriate 
sentence."" "
626,14," In addition, almost immediately following the statements to the Court on October 19, 1976, Assistant Attorney General Baker 
is reported to have made a further statement to the press concerning the Government's sentencing philosophy, stating: ""I intend 
to appear in court whenever I think it is necessary."" Wall Street Journal, October 20, 1976, p. 2. "
656,1," Section 11(c) of the Code provides: ""Section 11 -- The Engineer will not compete unfairly with another engineer by attempting to obtain employment or 
advancement or professional engagements by competitive bidding, . . . c. He shall not solicit or submit engineering proposals on the basis of competitive bidding. Competitive bidding for 
professional engineering services is defined as the formal or informal submission, or receipt, of verbal or written estimates 
of cost or proposals in terms of dollars, man days of work required, percentage of construction cost, or any other measure 
of compensation whereby the prospective client may compare engineering services on a price basis prior to the time that 
one engineer, or one engineering organization, has been selected for negotiations. The disclosure of recommended fee 
schedules prepared by various engineering societies is not considered to constitute competitive bidding. An Engineer 
requested to submit a fee proposal or bid prior to the selection of an engineer or firm subject to the negotiation of a 
satisfactory contract, shall attempt to have the procedure changed to conform to ethical practices, but if not successful he 
shall withdraw from consideration for the proposed work. These principles shall be applied by the Engineer in obtaining the 
services of other professionals ( F. 26, 389 F. Supp. 1193 at 1205)."
656,2," 15 U.S.C. § 29 (1970). The Statute was amended on December 21, 1974 to provide for initial review in the courts of appeals in 
most cases.  15 U.S.C. § 29(a) (Supp. V 1975). "
657,3," ""Section 11(c) prohibits defendant's members from engaging in any form of price competition when offering their services; 
selection is restricted to considerations of reputation and ability. No fee information may be given a prospective client which 
takes the form of cost estimates or other proposals in terms of dollars, man days of work required, or percentage of construction 
cost which can be compared to that of another engineer. Section 11(c), however, does permit members to disclose 
recommended state society fee schedules to prospective clients in the course of the selection process. Moreover, Sec. 9(b) of 
defendant's Code of Ethics requires its members not to accept work at a fee ""below the accepted standards of the profession in 
the area."" As a result of these sections, the only price information available for input into the client's selection equation is a 
uniformly regular fee schedule. "" (Footnotes omitted.) J.A. 9939-40, 389 F. Supp. at 1200."
657,*," * * * Upon careful review of the pertinent authorities, the Court is convinced that the ethical prohibition against competitive bidding is 
on its face a tampering with the price structure . . . "
658,4," We find largely irrelevant, in deciding the issue before us, opinions dealing with the legality of prohibitions on the advertising of 
professional fees.  Consumers Union v. American Bar Association, 427 F. Supp. 506 (E.D. Va. 1976) (three judge court); Bates 
v. Arizona State Bar, 113 Ariz. 394, 555 P.2d 640 (1976), prob.  juris. noted, 429 U.S. 813, 97 S. Ct. 53, 50 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1976). 
Apart from potential distinctions between professions, there is an enormous difference between advertising fee information to the 
general public and responding to a request for an estimate or bid on a particular job. Fee information thrust at the public is more 
likely to reach individuals unable to evaluate its significance. In addition, the professional who advertises his fee is generally 
publicizing a price for a project whose nature is not yet known to him. In contrast, the professional who responds to a request for 
a bid has a better grasp of the specific task before him and a better opportunity to take into account the sophistication of the 
potential purchaser. Thus we see no correlation between these two issues. "
659,5," For example, in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918), the effect on price 
was only a temporary hold, governing only a small part of total transactions, put into effect by a board of trade representing and 
regulating both buyers and sellers. The doctrine permitting some trade association reporting, which originated in Maple Flooring Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 
U.S. 563, 69 L. Ed. 1093, 45 S. Ct. 578 (1925), increased the amount of economic information available and thereby facilitated 
the rational decision-making necessary for effective competition. Further, the nature of the information exchanged, and the 
absence of any agreement to compel adherence to particular prices, made it highly unlikely that any anti-competitive abuse 
could occur."

666,3," In Crawford v. American Title Insurance Co., 5th Cir. 1975, 518 F.2d 217, the Court applied the McCarran-Ferguson Act 
exemption to the title insurance business in the face of allegations of an illegal conspiracy to restrain trade and to fix prices.  The 
field was held covered by the Alabama Insurance Trade Practice Act. 518 F.2d at 219. "
669,4," In Parker v. Brown, 1943, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315, the Court held the acts of a state commission exempt 
from federal antitrust regulation. The Parker doctrine derives from construction of congressional intent.  The Supreme Court has 
recently limited the Parker exemption. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 1975, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004 at 2015, 44 L. Ed. 2d 
572; Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 1976, 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141. Neither of these cases, however, 
deals with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, where Congress has made explicit its intent to create a broad exemption from the 
antitrust laws with regard to state regulation of the insurance business. See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra slip op. at 5366 
(Blackmun, J., concurring). "

683,4," The case law on this question is split.  In Milberg v. Lawrence Cedarhurst Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n., 496 F.2d 523 (2nd 
Cir. 1974), the court permitted a private cause of action after the FHLBB had declined to act on a mortgagor's complaint.  
However, Goldman v. First Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n. of Wilmette, 518 F.2d 1247, 1250 (7th Cir. 1975), suggests that the 
Milberg result may not be correct in light of recent Supreme Court explanations of when it is proper to infer a private cause of 
action to enforce federal regulations."
683,5," The complaint actually charges that the defendants acted in concert in changing from the ""capitalization"" method to the 
""escrow"" method for covering tax and insurance charges on mortgaged property. Affidavits submitted by the defendants show 
that they have never used the capitalization method.  Nevertheless, generously construed, the complaint can be read to charge 
a conspiracy to require escrowing and not to permit capitalization. See Kinee, supra, at 980."
683,6," The first and third facets are, of course, factually related, but distinct legal theories are pressed by plaintiffs in support of each

without respect to the amount in controversy, or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties, and shall recover the

industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, 
process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any

agreement which is prohibited by subsection (e) of this section; (B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of

violated by the restraint-on-transfer clause.  486 F.2d 907. "

709,7," Petitioners, of course, have the right of access to the agencies and courts to be heard. . . . That right, as indicated, is part of the

710,8," This brings us to the question of antitrust liability when union activity is held to be non-exempt. The principal danger of these 
recent rulings is that a finding of antitrust liability will automatically be made whenever the challenged conduct is held to be non-
exempt. This would be a per se approach with a vengeance. Arrangements may fall outside the scope of mandatory bargaining 
and yet have no adverse effect on competition. We still must find whether the agreement restrains trade and whether the 
restraint is unreasonable. A fair reading of Jewel Tea [Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., Inc., 381 U.S. 676, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. 
Ct. 1596 (1965).] satisfies me that the Court intended that there be a full-scale rule of reason inquiry in every instance in which a 
non-exempt activity is claimed to be in violation of antitrust. Handler, Labor and Antitrust: A Bit of History, 40 Antitrust L.J. 233, 239-40 (1971). Cf.  Jacobi v. Bache & Co., Inc., 520 F.2d 
1231, 1238-39 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1053, 46 L. Ed. 2d 642, 96 S. Ct. 784 (1976)."
710,9," On appeal, the NMU's brief did not discuss the antitrust claim at issue here, presumably because the district court did not reach 
it. Also, in their complaint and their briefs in this court, Commerce and Vantage have argued that the alleged group boycott was 
illegal per se. If, on remand, the district court determines that the rule of reason theory should apply, appellants should be 
allowed to press their claim of a group boycott antitrust violation under that theory."
710,10," We realize that the district court has already determined that the restraint-on-transfer clause was not the result of a conspiracy 
between the NMU and the large shipping companies to enhance their competitive position.  Our remand on the issue of an 
illegal group boycott does not disturb that finding, but by the same token, the finding does not foreclose full examination of 
appellants' group boycott claim. We note that in Connell, ""there was no evidence that Local 100's organizing campaign was 
connected with any agreement with members of the multiemployer bargaining unit. . . ."" 421 U.S. at 625 n.2. The Court 
nonetheless considered the multiemployer bargaining agreement as ""relevant in determining the effect that the agreement 
between Local 100 and Connell would have on the business market."" Id. at 623. The same considerations apply in this case. 
Although the district court found no conspiracy between the NMU and the large shipping companies to injure the smaller 
companies, it must still evaluate the agreement between the NMU and the shipping companies for its effect on the market. "
711,1," It seems to me there is considerable doubt of the continued validity of the limitation of recovery for wrongful injunction to the 
amount of the bond. See Metzger & Friedlander, The Preliminary Injunction: Injury Without Remedy?  29 Bus. Law. 913 (1974); 
Note, Interlocutory Injunctions and the Injunction Bond, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 333 (1959); and Note, Recovery of Damages on 
Injunction Bonds, 32 Colum. L. Rev. 869 (1932). However, as appropriate recovery should be available for violations of the 
antitrust laws, no purpose would be served by further examination of that question. "
712,2," The district court's opinion arrives at the same basic finding but for its legal conclusion which we today reject that the NMU's 
resort to arbitration and the ensuing injunction were nonactionable superseding causes.  411 F. Supp. at 1239."
712,3," This view is fully consistent with the thoughts of Professor Handler whose comments are favorably cited by the majority: To me the test should be this: Whatever is required or expressly authorized under existing labor legislation should be 
exempt from the antitrust laws. And whatever is mandatory should be determined in the light of our national labor policy, 
which should override any countervailing antitrust considerations. Handler, Labor and Antitrust: A Bit of History, 40 Antitrust L.J. 233, 238 (1971). Perhaps a finding of no exemption entails a preliminary appraisal of the nature and merits of the underlying antitrust claim, but it 
does not necessarily follow that the labor organization will be found liable on that claim. ""Exemption and liability are not co-
extensive concepts."" Id. at 237. The removal of the shroud of immunity simply means that the union must answer to the charge 
of violating the antitrust laws."
712,4," In a post-Connell decision, the Eighth Circuit has found the per se approach to be inapplicable to a group boycott arising out of 
a labor agreement. See Mackey v. National Football League, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. 
Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977). A rule of reason inquiry in the context of a labor boycott might well be an appropriate means to 
balance the goals of the antitrust laws with the positive values of collective-bargaining."

] § 291. Authorization of associations; powers Persons engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers 
may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively processing, preparing 
for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce, such products of persons so engaged. Such 
association may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members may make the necessary 
contracts and agreements to effect such purposes: Provided, however, That such associations are operated for the mutual 
benefit of the members thereof, as such producers, and conform to one or both of the following requirements: First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership 
capital he may own therein, or, Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum. And in any case to the following: Third. That the association shall not deal in the products of non-members to an amount greater in value than such as are 
handled by it for members. § 292. Monopolizing or restraining trade and unduly enhancing prices prohibited; remedy and procedure If the Secretary of Agriculture shall have reason to believe that any such association monopolizes or restrains trade in 
interstate or foreign commerce to such an extent that the price of any agricultural product is unduly enhanced by reason 
thereof, he shall serve upon such association a complaint stating his charge in that respect, to which complaint shall be 
attached, or contained therein, a notice of hearing, specifying a day and place not less than thirty days after the service 
thereof, requiring the association to show cause why an order should not be made directing it to cease and desist from 
monopolization or restraint of trade. An association so complained of may at the time and place so fixed show cause why 
such order should not be entered. The evidence given on such a hearing shall be taken under such rules and regulations 
as the Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe, reduced to writing, and made a part of the record therein. If upon such 
hearing the Secretary of Agriculture shall be of the opinion that such association monopolizes or restrains trade in interstate 
or foreign commerce to such an extent that the price of any agricultural product is unduly enhanced thereby, he shall issue 
and cause to be served upon the association an order reciting the facts found by him, directing such association to cease 
and desist from monopolization or restraint of trade.  On the request of such association or if such association fails or 
neglects for thirty days to obey such order, the Secretary of Agriculture shall file in the district court in the judicial district in 
which such association has its principal place of business a certified copy of the order and of all the records in the 
proceeding, together with a petition asking that the order be enforced, and shall give notice to the Attorney General and to 
said association of such filing. Such district court shall thereupon have jurisdiction to enter a decree affirming, modifying, or 
setting aside said order, or enter such other decree as the court may deem equitable, and may make rules as to pleadings 
and proceedings to be had in considering such order. The place of trial may, for cause or by consent of parties, be changed 
as in other causes. The facts found by the Secretary of Agriculture and recited or set forth in said order shall be prima facie evidence of such 
facts, but either party may adduce additional evidence. The Department of Justice shall have charge of the enforcement of 
such order. After the order is so filed in such district court and while pending for review therein the court may issue a 
temporary writ of injunction forbidding such association from violating such order or any part thereof. The court may, upon 
conclusion of its hearing, enforce its decree by a permanent injunction or other appropriate remedy. Service of such 
complaint and of all notices may be made upon such association by service upon any officer or agent thereof engaged in "
718,," carrying on its business, or on any attorney authorized to appear in such proceeding for such association, and such service 
shall be binding upon such association, the officers, and members thereof."
718,7," U.S.C. §§ 291-92. Eight years prior to passage of the Capper-Volstead Act, Congress enacted section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17: HN2[
] § 17. Antitrust laws not applicable to labor organizations The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.  Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be 
construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for the 
purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of 
such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members 
thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws. This was the first Congressional action to protect cooperative endeavors from the antitrust laws. Capper-Volstead's effect was 
""to clarify the exemption for agricultural organizations and to extend it to cooperatives having capital stock."" Case- Swayne Co. 
v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 389 U.S. 384, 391, 88 S. Ct. 528, 532, 19 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1967)."

389 U.S. 384, 88 S. Ct. 528, 19 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1967), in which the Court held that the Sunkist cooperative could not qualify for 
the exemption because some of its members were packing houses that contracted with fruit growers to handle the growers' fruit 
for cost plus a fixed fee.  389 U.S. at 387, 88 S. Ct. 528. The Supreme Court in Case-Swayne emphasized that the legislative 
history of Capper-Volstead made clear Congress's purpose to limit the shelter of the Act to actual growers. Id. at 391-93, 88 S. 
Ct. 528. Thus, the Court concluded that ""Congress did not intend to allow an organization with such nonproducer interests [i.e., 
the packing houses] to avail itself of the Capper-Volstead exemption."" Id. at 395-96, 88 S. Ct. at 535. The instant case is a logical successor to Case-Swayne. In Case-Swayne, the Supreme Court had little difficulty concluding that 
the packing houses were not farmers. Here, entities somewhat analogous to the packing houses, broiler integrators, assert that

others who may be engaged in the production of agricultural products, or are those words merely descriptive of the general 
subject? ""Mr. KELLOGG. I think they are descriptive of the general subject. I think 'farmers' would have covered them all. ""Mr. CUMMINS. I think the Senator does not exactly catch my point. Take the flouring mills of Minneapolis: They are 
engaged, in a broad sense, in the production of an agricultural product. The packers are engaged, in a broad sense, in the 
production of an agricultural product. The Senator does not intend by this bill to confer upon them the privileges which the 
bill grants, I assume? ""Mr. KELLOGG. Certainly not; and I do not think a proper construction of the bill grants them any such privileges. The bill

there was a dramatic growth in the amount of farm tenancy in the country. By the end of the 1920s, a large percentage of 
the nation's farmers no longer owned the land they worked. Tenancy rates were exceptionally high in the specialized cash-

760,1," The Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. § 276a et seq. requires contractors awarded bids by the federal government to contract that 
the laborers and mechanics used on that job will be paid certain minimum wages, determined by the Secretary of Labor to be 
prevailing for the corresponding class of laborers in the geographic area.  The Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act, 43 P.S. § 165-
1 et seq., imposes a similar requirement for construction contracts with the state government.  The United States Supreme Court 
held, in United States v. Binghamton Const. Co., Inc., 347 U.S. 171, 74 S. Ct. 438, 98 L. Ed. 594 (1954), that ""On its face, the 
[Davis-Bacon] Act is a minimum wage law designed for the benefit of construction workers."" I do not, by this opinion, make any 
judgment with respect to the standing of closed shop contractors to bring an action charging violations of the Davis-Bacon Act; I 
only have declined to dismiss such an action at this point.  The standing issues have not been adequately briefed by the parties.  
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently found that laborers had an implied right of action against the contractor for 
violations of the Davis-Bacon Act.  McDaniel v. University of Chicago, 548 F.2d 689 (7th Cir. filed January 21, 1977).  However, 
the United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. Binghamton, supra, 347 U.S. at 176-77, 74 S. Ct. at 441, found that: The language of the [Davis-Bacon] Act and its legislative history plainly show that it was not enacted to benefit contractors, 
but rather to protect their employees from substandard earnings by fixing a floor under wages on Government projects. An implied right of action for contractors under the Davis-Bacon Act might be counterindicated by the Supreme Court's decision 
in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 2088, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975), which required a court, implying a right of action 
under a statute, to specifically find that a claimant was a member of the ""class for whose especial benefit the statute was 
enacted."" (citation omitted, emphasis supplied by the Supreme Court). "
762,2," Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Rule 56. SUMMARY JUDGMENT (e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required.  Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the 
affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.  Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred 
to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.  The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or 
opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.  When a motion for summary judgment is made 
and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, 
but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a 
genuine issue for trial.  If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him. (f) When Affidavits are Unavailable.  Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot for 
reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment 
or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may 
make such other order as is just. "
763,3," On August 5, 1976 the Court denied, in part, plaintiffs' alternate motions for dismissal of defendants' counterclaims or for 
summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed, on August 19, 1976, a motion for reconsideration of the Court's August 5, 1976 order.  The 
counterclaimants filed their response to the motion for reconsideration on September 9, 1976, asserting that a ""massive amount 
of data"" existed in support of the counterclaims which the plaintiffs had not even attempted to inspect.  Plaintiffs sought to 
inspect such data, which was accomplished on Nov. 1, 1976 pursuant to the Court's order of October 19, 1976. Plaintiffs were 
allowed to inspect some of the material defendants averred supported the wage-fixing counterclaims; other materials were 
withheld by the defendants as privileged. In their supplemental response to the motion for reconsideration the defendants 
berated the plaintiffs for their failure to submit a motion to order the production of those materials withheld on November 1, 1976.  
Yet, as of March 24, 1977, the counterclaimants have never once sought to compel answers to interrogatories from plaintiffs 
after an interval of more than seven months since the motion for reconsideration was filed.  The defendants weakly claim that 
they have not had the opportunity for discovery. However, the defendants cannot expect the court to adopt the posture of 
litigants, requiring plaintiffs to supply answers to interrogatories when defendants have not requested the same.  It is obvious 
that no steps have been taken to compel production of the information allegedly within the plaintiffs' control.  The 
counterclaimants have not even attempted to identify for the Court with any specificity what information they desire to obtain.  
The defendants' assertion that the data necessary to oppose the present motion for summary judgment is within the control of 
the plaintiffs is, at best, ""merely colorable."" See Robin Construction Co., supra, at 614. "

September 9, 1976 Brief of Defendants on the Issue Whether the Court Should Reconsider its August 5, 1976 Order on the 
Defendants' Amended Counterclaim, at 8, n. 4.  The Third Affirmative Defense raised by the Reply of Plaintiffs to Defendants' 
Amended Counterclaim, Document No. 83, filed on August 7, 1974 in C.A.No. 73-773, at 4, is that defendants lack standing to

765,," Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in International Ass'n, held in the absence of a labor dispute, that: ""there is no reason to 
hold that a union is any different from any other economic unit in its right to be protected from illegal restraints on its freedom to 
compete."" 483 F.2d at 396-397. Furthermore, Judge Forman found that: According to traditional theories of direct-in-direct harm which have been applied by court decisions in order to limit the 
sweep of antitrust liability, the harm suffered by members of the Unions would be indirect, as they are adversely affected by 
the conspiracy directed against their employers, the non Association contractors, not parties to the present suit.  However, 
the ""target"" theory logically can encompass any claim of damage in the affected area.  483 F.2d at 397. The ""target"" theory, according to Judge Forman, was enunciated in the leading case of Karseal Corp. v. Richfield Oil 
Corporations, 221 F.2d 358 (9th Cir. 1955), where the court asked: ""was Karseal within the 'target area' of Richfield's illegal 
practices, determined in the Richfield case?  Assuming Karseal was 'hit' by the effect of the Richfield antitrust violations, was 
Karseal 'aimed at' with enough precision to entitle it to maintain a treble damage suit under the Clayton Act?"" Conference of 
Studio Unions v. Loew's Inc., 193 F.2d 51, 55 (9th Cir. 1951), cited at 483 F.2d at 396. In this case the Unions would be directly injured by any conspiracy which would ""set wage rates and labor costs at a lower than 
prevailing level commonly known as a 'substandard' level."" Amendment to Defendants' Counterclaim, Document No. 75, filed 
June 19, 1974 in C.A.No. 73-773, P 48.  Contrariwise, defendant Unions would only be indirectly injured by any conspiracy 
which would ""erode, remove and make unavailable the obtaining of substantial portions of the construction industry opportunities 
by those who employ members of defendant unions."", namely ""unionized contractors"".  Amendments to Defendants' 
Counterclaim, Document No. 75, filed June 10, 1974 in C.A.No. 73-773, P 51, §§ A and C.  Consistent with the ""target theory"" 
articulated in Judge Forman's opinion, in the event of either direct or indirect injury, the Unions have standing to sue in this case. See note 1, supra, for a discussion of the ""standing"" of contractor associations to bring a suit for alleged violations of the Davis-
Bacon Act. "
766,6," The defendants assert that ABC has approximately 8,000 members nationwide, but that only 1192 of its members belonged to 
the insurance plan. See Supplemental Answers on Behalf of Certain Defendant Unions to Plaintiffs' Interrogatories to Amended 
Counterclaim at 3, n. 2."
766,7," § 1012(b) provides: . . . the Sherman Act . . . shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated 
by State law. "
767,8," In order to determine whether a specific insurance or insurance-related activity is included within the McCarran-Ferguson Act 
exemption, the court must consider the scope of the statutory term ""business of insurance"", the extent of state regulation over 
any insurance arrangement, and the presence or absence of boycott, coercion or intimidation (the McCarran Act being 
inapplicable to the latter activities.  See 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b) (1970).) Travelers Insurance Co. v. Blue Cross of Western 
Pennsylvania, 481 F.2d 80, 82 (3d Cir. 1973). Certain activities of insurance companies are clearly exempt in accordance with 
the Act.  See 481 F.2d at 82. It has been established that the ""business of insurance"" refers to ""control over the relationship 
between the insurance company and its policyholders."" 481 F.2d at 82. "
768,9," If one accepts for the sake of argument the defendants' theory of the construction market's configuration, then it is not 
surprising that the defendants are unable to demonstrate any anticompetitive effects produced either by the ABC's insurance 
and retirement plans or by the alleged scheme among some ABC contractors to set uniform wage rates on private construction 
jobs.  The defendants, in paragraph 8 of their Answer and Counterclaim (Document No. 39, filed April 26, 1974 in C.A.No. 73-
773), maintain that: . . . the construction field is not a ""high labor intensive"" area.  Rather, construction costs are generally dependent upon 
many factors such as acquisition costs, mortgage placement fees, interest rates, materials cost, equipment rentals, 
commissions, site development fees, and other factors.  The cost of labor is not a ""large portion of the cost"" as alleged by 
Plaintiffs, but merely a small fraction of the total cost of most construction projects.  As such, the difference in labor cost 
among the various contractors does not have a significant impact upon the competitive forces in the construction market 
place. (emphasis added) Hence, any variation in fringe benefit rates, or wage rates, should not alter the bidding capacity of any one contractor and, thus, 
plaintiffs alleged activities, even if true, should not have any anticompetitive effect. "

benefit of his employees and their beneficiaries all plan participants shall be considered to be his employees. (3) Vesting. -- Section 411 shall be applied as if all employers who maintain the plan constituted a single employer, except 
that the application of any rules with respect to breaks in service shall be made under regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of Labor. (4) Funding. -- The minimum funding standard provided by section 412 shall be determined as if all participants in the plan 
were employed by a single employer. (5) Liability for funding tax. -- For a plan year the liability under section 4971 of each employer who maintains the plan shall 
be determined in a reasonable manner not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate -- (A) first on the basis of their respective delinquencies in meeting required employer contributions under the plan, and (B) then on the basis of their respective liabilities for contributions under the plan. (6) Deduction limitations. -- Each applicable limitation provided by section 404(a) shall be determined as if all participants in 
the plan were employed by a single employer.  The amounts contributed to or under the plan by each employer who 
maintains the plan, for the portion of this taxable year which is included within such a plan year, shall be considered not to 
exceed such a limitation if the anticipated employer contributions for such plan year (determined in a reasonable manner 
not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate) do not exceed such limitation.  If such "
770,," anticipated contributions exceed such a limitation, the portion of each such employer's contributions which is not deductible 
under section 404 shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate. Allocations of amounts under paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), among employers maintaining the plan, shall not be inconsistent 
with regulations prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary or his delegate."

770,12," ERISA § 1014, Int.Rev.Code of 1954, § 413(a)(1) provides, in part: § 413. Collectively bargained plans, etc. (a) Application of subsection (b). -- Subsection (b) applies to -- (1) a plan, maintained pursuant to an agreement which the 
Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more

770,14," ERISA § 201(4), 29 U.S.C.A. § 1051(4) (Supp.1977). Prior to the enactment of ERISA, plans maintained by more than one employer were not specifically authorized by the Internal 
Revenue Code in the absence of collective bargaining. However, collectively bargained multi-employer plans were provided for 
by § 501(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  ERISA, therefore, sparked and authorized the very kind of plan which 
defendants claim is illegal under the antitrust laws. See generally Chadwick & Foster, ""Federal Regulation of Retirement Plans: 
The Quest for Parity,"" 28 Vand.L.Rev. 641 (1975), for an exhaustive discussion of the regulatory scheme prior to the adoption of 
ERISA, the legislative history of the Act, and its impact on medical, pension and retirement plans. "
771,15," Defendants assert that there is an undisclosed transcript of a tape recorded session which proves the conspiracy to conduct a 
public relations campaign. The defendants have neither apprised the Court of the content of such a transcript, nor have they 
requested that the materials be reviewed in camera. All of the defendants submissions to date indicate that the transcript, if read, 
would indicate that a concerted public relations campaign was conducted.  However, there has been no representation that the 
transcript will reveal that statements made in the public relations campaign were either false or constituted misrepresentations. If 
the defendants chose not to submit the transcript to the Court, at the very least they could have stated in what way certain "
772,," materials constituted malicious misrepresentations. Instead, the defendants have rested on the mere assertion that the 
campaign was malicious, and therefore must suffer the consequences of a summary judgment. The Court cannot premise a 
decision on speculation about the import of evidence admittedly within the control of the party opposing the motion for summary 
judgment. "
775,*," Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation. "
776,1," An ""occurrence"" policy protects the holder from liability for any act done while the policy is in effect; a ""claims made"" policy, in 
contrast, protects the holder only against claims made during the policy's life. Thus a doctor who practiced for only one year, say 
1972, would need only one 1972 ""occurrence"" policy to be fully covered, but he would need several years of ""claims made"" 
policies to protect himself from claims arising out of his acts in 1972."
776,2," At our request, both sides briefed the question of whether the plaintiffs' antitrust claim was mooted when the state of Rhode 
Island formed a joint underwriting association to provide malpractice insurance. Because of the state's action, St. Paul never 
gathered the fruits of the alleged conspiracy. Nonetheless, we are convinced that, for purposes of our jurisdiction, the state's act 
did not extinguish plaintiffs' every claim for relief.  United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, Inc. 393 U.S. 199, 
203-04, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968). We do not decide whether plaintiffs were in fact ""injured in [their] business or 
property"".  15 U.S.C. § 15, Cf. n. 7 infra. Nor do we decide whether this would be an appropriate case for injunctive relief. "
777,3," In attacking the district court's decision, appellants cite an additional case from the Fifth Circuit. Battle v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins.  
Co., 493 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1110, 42 L. Ed. 2d 807, 95 S. Ct. 784 (1975). Although appellees 
correctly point out that Battle is distinguishable and that it was decided before Meicler, supra, the Battle court did not show a 
willingness to give the boycott provision a straightforward reading, an attitude that we share. See also Ballard v. Blue Shield, 543 
F.2d 1075, 1078 (4th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 922, 97 S. Ct. 1341, 51 L. Ed. 2d 601, 45 U.S.L.W. 3601 (1977)."
777,4," Most cases have dealt with boycotts directed against retailers or other links in the chain of production and distribution. E.g., 
Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 (1941); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. 
Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358, 81 S. Ct. 365 (1961). Consumers have less frequently been 
prey to illegal boycotts, perhaps because a large class of victims cannot easily be coerced without destroying the secrecy on "
778,," which illegal boycotts often depend. But the features that make boycotts objectionable do not disappear when consumers are 
boycotted. Like boycotts aimed at retailers, concerted refusals to deal with consumers may restrain traders' ""ability to sell in 
accordance with their own judgment""; they can deprive consumers of the ""freedom to buy . . . in an open competitive market""; 
and they ""interfere with the natural flow of interstate commerce"". See Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, 359 U.S. 
at 212-13. The Ninth Circuit has held that a boycott of customers is a boycott for antitrust purposes.  Washington State Bowling 
Proprietors Ass'n v. Pacific Lanes, Inc., 356 F.2d 371, 376 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 963, 16 L. Ed. 2d 674, 86 S. Ct. 
1590 (1966). Some commentators would artificially restrict the meaning of ""boycott"", apparently fearing an overbroad application of the rule 
that boycotts are illegal per se. See L. Sullivan, Antitrust §§ 83, 90 (1977). This fear may be allayed more directly by recognizing 
that, while some boycotts are irredeemably anticompetitive and thus fit subjects for a per se rule, others are benign and not 
properly treated as illegal per se. See P.  Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 287 (1967); see also Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. 
Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71 (9th Cir. 1969) (boycott not illegal per se when participants had no anti-competitive 
motive).  Certainly nothing in this opinion requires the application of a per se rule to all acts falling within the ordinary meaning of 
the word ""boycott"". "
779,5," We cannot ignore, however, the great haste with which the Act was drafted and passed. The provision that all now agree is 
central to the Act - the exception of insurance to the extent that it is regulated by state law - did not appear in the Act until it was 
inserted by the House and Senate conferees. See 91 Cong.Rec. 488 (1945); id. 1945; id. 1396.  Only at the last moment did a 
measure that was intended originally as a three-year moratorium on Sherman and Clayton Act coverage become a lasting 
exemption. This change was not noted in the conference report or the statement of the House conferees, id., although it was 
uncovered by Senator Pepper in the floor debates. Id. at 1478."
779,6," S.Rep.No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945), accompanying S. 340; and H.Rep.No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945). "
781,7," We recognize that the dismissal could be affirmed if none of the plaintiffs have standing to sue. But the change in malpractice 
coverage has increased costs for the doctors. The alleged conspiracy thus strikes at their ""business or property"", 15 U.S.C. § 15, 
even if that phrase refers only to ""commercial interests"".  Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. "
782,," Ct. 885 (1972). And no one is more directly injured by a conspiracy among insurance sellers than those who buy the insurance. 
See generally, L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 247 (1976).  Because the doctors named as plaintiffs have standing, we find it 
unnecessary to decide whether the patients have standing or not. "
783,1," The Supreme Court has said that ""the relationship between insurer and insured, the type of policy which [can] be issued, its 
reliability, interpretation, and enforcement - these [are] the core of the 'business of insurance'"" covered by the McCarran-
Ferguson Act.  SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668, 89 S. Ct. 564 (1969)."
783,2," I do not question that the boycott-coercion-intimidation language might in some other context be pushed to the limits which the 
court approves. But these words are hardly so focused as to permit only the broadest, most general meaning. A more limited 
interpretation, besides comporting with the statutory structure and the legislative history, squares with the Supreme Court's 
definition of a group boycott as ""concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders"", Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 
Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 212, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959). See L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 90 at 257 (1976). Furthermore, even reading the boycott exception to include the complained of behavior does not wholly solve the question of 
plaintiffs' standing. If St. Paul is attempting to corner the malpractice market, the more obvious harm is to those companies that 
are being closed out. It can be argued that the higher prices to doctors are only an indirect consequence and that the physicians 
have not suffered the sort of direct injury necessary to bring suit. See Battle v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co., 493 F.2d 39, 
49 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1110, 42 L. Ed. 2d 807, 95 S. Ct. 784 (1975) (plaintiff must show himself to be in 
sector of economy in which violation threatens to break down competitive conditions). This sort of problem suggests that the 
doctors' ostensible antitrust action is aimed less at protecting the free market system than at consumer protection goals left by "
784,," Congress to state regulation. See generally SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668, 89 S. Ct. 564 
(1969). "
787,*," Hon. Frederick vanPelt Bryan of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
788,1," The petition was actually filed jointly by BOC and several of its subsidiaries, all of which are affected by the FTC order. 
Because the separate identity of these subsidiaries has no bearing on the principal issues in this case, we adopt the convention 
of the FTC below of referring to all BOC-related companies under the singular noun ""BOC."" See In re British Oxygen Co. 
(""Findings as to the Facts, Conclusions and Order""), No. 8955, slip op. at 9 (FTC Dec. 8, 1975)."
788,2," The FTC's definition of the relevant domestic industrial gases market is challenged by BOC, but this dispute does not affect our 
disposition of the instant appeal. The question of market definition is relevant to the issue of how important potential competition 
from BOC would be to the industrial gases industry, an issue we need not reach here. "
789,3," The amicus brief argues that BOC's acquisition of Airco should be viewed as a toehold acquisition. Under the generally 
accepted definitions of such an acquisition, however, see, e.g., Kennecott Copper Corp. v. FTC, 467 F.2d 67, 77-78 n.8 (10th 
Cir. 1972) (""acquisition of a firm too small to compete by itself against the largest firms""), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 909, 40 L. Ed. 
2d 114, 94 S. Ct. 1617 (1974); United States v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 367 F. Supp. 1226, 1258 (C.D. Cal. 1973) (acquisition 
""sufficient to assist the potential entrant over the entry barriers . . . but not so large that the entrant merely replaces the acquired 
company""), aff'd mem., 418 U.S. 906, 94 S. Ct. 3199, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1154 (1974); Robinson, Antitrust Developments: 1973, 74 
Colum. L. Rev. 163, 182 n.137 (1974) (acquisition ""of a small market factor that presumably would increase the vigor of 
competition by strengthening the acquired firm""); Turner, Conglomerate Mergers and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 78 Harv. L. 
Rev. 1313, 1368 (1965) (""acquisition of a small firm whose market share has remained the same . . . and that is demonstrably 
less efficient than its large competitors""), it is most unlikely that Airco, the third largest company in the American industrial gases 
market, holding a 16% share while the top two firms have 26% and 18% shares, could be considered a toehold firm. See 
generally Comment, Toehold Acquisitions and the Potential Competition Doctrine, 40 U. Chi. L. Rev. 156 (1972); Case Note, 89 
Harv. L. Rev. 800 (1976). We shall assume for the balance of this discussion that BOC's acquisition did not amount to a toehold."
789,4," The FTC's opinion mentions an additional source of possible procompetitive BOC influence, derived not from BOC's future 
entry into the market but from BOC's future presence on the fringe of the market. FTC Op.  at 16. It is theoretically possible that 
a firm not currently exerting a fringe effect, as is concededly the case here, id. at 15 n.8, 16, could exert such an effect in the 
future, regardless of whether it actually entered the market. Mr. Justice Marshall has termed such a firm ""a potential perceived 
potential entrant,"" Falstaff, supra, 410 U.S. at 560 n.15 (concurring opinion) (emphasis in original), and noted the difficulties 
involved in moving from theory to reality: As its very name suggests, . . . such a firm would be still a further step removed from the exertion of actual, present 
competitive influence, and the problems of proof are compounded accordingly - particularly in light of the showing of 
reasonable probability required under § 7. Id. When there is no evidence of a past or present fringe effect, it would seem the height of speculation to consider a future fringe 
effect as a factor independent of the likelihood that the firm in question would actually enter the market. The entirely speculative 
nature of such a factor is apparent on the face of the Commission's opinion here: Although there is no evidence of such disciplining effect in the past, if present trends continue and supply becomes tight, 
leading firms may coordinate pricing decisions and areas of specialization. . . . The possibility of entry by BOC may become 
a factor to be reckoned with. "
790,," FTC Op. at 16 (emphasis added). No evidence was cited by the Commission as to the likelihood of any of the key variables 
becoming reality in the future. Accordingly, we will not consider the possibility of a future fringe effect as an independent reason 
for blocking this acquisition."
790,5," According to Professor Turner: The problem of proving that the new entrant would have been a substantial competitive factor can be overstated. It is highly 
likely that a new entrant in . . . a tight oligopoly industry . . . will shake things up a great deal in the process of trying to 
acquire a substantial market share, even if in the end its inroads are rather modest."
790,78," Harv. L. Rev. at 1383. The Supreme Court's apparent emphasis on the procompetitive effects factor in Marine Bancorp., 418 
U.S. at 633, must be read in the context of the unique facts of that case, in which banking industry regulation of branch banks 
hindered the acquiring firm's ability to enter or expand, id. at 638. See L. Sullivan Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 640 (1977); 
The Supreme Court, 1973 Term, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 41, 256-58 (1974)."
790,6," The Court in Brown Shoe Co. v. United States set forth the 1950 amendments to Section 7 of the Clayton Act in footnote 18, 
370 U.S. at 311. In another footnote the Court discussed the legislative history at some length, stating in part: "
791,," In the course of both the Committee hearings and floor debate, attention was occasionally focused on the issue of whether 
""possible,"" ""probable"" or ""certain"" anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger would have to be proven to establish a 
violation of the Act. . . . The final Senate Report on the question was explicit on the point: ""The use of these words [""may be""] means that the bill, if enacted, would not apply to the mere possibility but only to the 
reasonable probability of the prescribed [sic] effect. . . . A requirement of certainty and actuality of injury to competition is 
incompatible with any effort to supplement the Sherman Act by reaching incipient restraints."" S.  Rep. No. 1775, 81st 
Cong., 2d Sess. 6. See also 51 Cong. Rec. 14464 (remarks of Senator Reed)."
791,370, U.S. at 323 n.39.
791,7," Because of the predictive or probabilistic nature of the entire actual potential entrant doctrine, Professor Turner has argued that 
a higher standard of proof regarding entry of the firm is appropriate when, as is the case here, ""the sole alleged anticompetitive 
consequence of a merger is the loss of what would have been a new entrant."" 78 Harv. L. Rev. at 1386 (emphasis in original). 
The standard suggested is one of certainty, id., or at least of ""clear proof that the firm would in fact have entered - an admittedly 
rare case, and one bound to become even less frequent if this rule were adopted,"" id. at 1384. Turner's test has apparently been 
adopted by the Fourth Circuit, FTC v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 549 F.2d 289, 294-295 (4th Cir. 1977), which found ""peripheral 
support"" for Turner's view in Falstaff and Marine Bancorp., id. at 13. The Fourth Circuit was, however, concededly drawing 
implications from ambiguous Supreme Court statements or actions in the latter two cases. See id. at 14. In view of the ample 
express authority, including congressional authority, in favor of a reasonable probability standard, as discussed in the text and 
note 6 supra, we decline to adopt any more stringent standard here."
791,8," The Court in United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 458, 12 L. Ed. 2d 953, 84 S. Ct. 1738 (1964), in turn cited 
United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 651, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12, 84 S. Ct. 1044 (1964), for this proposition. We assume 
this reference was to Mr. Justice Douglas's language for the El Paso Court: HN7[
] The effect on competition in a particular market through acquisition of another company is determined by the 
nature or extent of that market and by the nearness of the absorbed company to it, that company's eagerness to enter that 
market, its resourcefulness, and so on. Id. at 660. The context makes clear that in El Paso the Court was referring to proximity both in time and place.  Id. at 660-61. 
Since there a geographic market, and a regulated one at that, was involved, considerations of proximity in place were relevant; 
here that is not the case. "
809,1," It is axiomatic that, in order for a federal action to be cognizable under the Sherman Act, the challenged activity must either be 
in interstate commerce or else have a substantial effect thereupon.  See Battle v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co., 493 F.2d 
39, 47 (5 Cir. 1974) and cases cited therein. "
810,2," Plaintiffs had argued that many persons employing brokerage services are in the process of either moving into or out of the 
state, and that the alleged price-fixing activity by defendants is a per se Sherman Act violation which presumes that the 
jurisdictional requirement of the statute is satisfied.  Yet, the mere interstate movement of a prospective buyer or seller -- 
occurring either prior to or after the furnishing of brokerage services -- hardly infuses such services with the requisite impact 
upon interstate commerce. Equally clear, in our view, is the fact that the per se rule of antitrust law relates solely to the merits 
of the claim and does not dispense with the threshold obligation of the claimant to establish subject matter jurisdiction."
810,3," Considering the results of this discovery and the supplemental briefs of counsel in addition to the pre-existing record, we 
reiterate the view that it is only via the Goldfarb analysis that this action may be said to arise under the Sherman Act. Thus 
rejected is argument by plaintiffs in their final memorandum that brokerage activities take place in interstate commerce by dint of 
a ""national relocation service"" in which two defendant realtors apparently participate.  The service essentially involves an 
exchange of lists of brokers between realtors in different states.  A participating realtor in one state will furnish to a client wishing 
to buy property in another the name of a broker therein who appears on the list, and receives a ""referral fee"" upon 
consummation of the sale by the out-of-state broker. What plaintiffs fail to show in this approach is that the brokerage activity complained of herein occurs in or substantially affects 
interstate commerce. We do not construe their complaint to allege price-fixing with regard to broker referral fees, but only with 
regard to the fees which arise out of realtors' services in connection with the purchase or sale of real estate in the New Orleans 
area.  We disregard the separate and independent participation of a broker in referring clients to out-of-state sources, therefore, 
and focus upon the possible interstate commerce effects of the in-state transaction by which a broker regularly earns his 
commission. "
811,4," In no way contradictory is the deposition testimony of two federal officials involved in the financing/insurance aspect of local 
real estate transactions.  Angel Miranda, an area economist for the New Orleans office of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD), testified as to various programs operative in this area whereby his agency, as well as the Fair Housing 
Administration (FHA), make mortgage insurance available to home-buyers; but he made no reference to broker activity in this 
connection.  See Dep. of Angel Miranda.  Another HUD official, Meaher Turner, gave further testimony concerning these loan 
insurance programs, but spoke of brokers only to the extent their services have been used by HUD in the sale of repossessed 
property.  See Dep. of Meaher P. Turner. Moreover, counsel for both sides cite in their memoranda the deposition of Paul Greiner, a loan guaranty officer for the Veterans 
Administration (VA).  The transcript of this particular testimony nowhere appears in the record.  But it nevertheless is worth 
noting that the memorandum of plaintiffs' counsel confirms what defendants represent to have been Greiner's testimony, i.e., 
that real estate brokers play no role in the actual process during which the VA decides whether to guarantee a loan.  See 
Plaintiffs' Supp. Memo in Opposition to Motion, at p. 11; Defendants' Third Supp. Memo in Support of Motion, at p. 7."
811,5," An apparent discrepancy exists between this statement and that of affiant-brokers Max Derbes, Jr. and Dalton L. Truax, Jr. to 
the effect that brokers ""earn their commissions upon procuring a purchaser or seller. . .."" See Affidavits of Max Derbes, Jr. and 
Dalton L. Truax, Jr., att'd to Defendants' Motion.  Regardless of the exact point in time at which the commission accrues, 
however, the critical inquiry remains whether the service for which a broker earns his commission entails the financing and/or 
insurance of the transaction."
811,6," In deposition testimony, Derbes clarified this reference to the brokerage function being ""essentially"" completed at the time a 
purchaser or seller is procured.  In ""many cases,"" he declared, the broker has done all he must do at this stage, although in 
some instances his continued assistance might be needed to ""make sure everybody is performing the conditions of the 
contract."" See Dep. of Max Derbes, Jr., at 58.  As far as involvement in financing is concerned, however, Derbes emphatically 
denied that under the standard form agreement to purchase or sell a broker acquires the authority to obtain financing on behalf 
of his client.  See id., at 60-62. "
812,7," To the extent matters beyond the pleadings have been called to the court's attention, the motion, albeit styled a motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim, may be treated as one for summary judgment.  See Rule 12(b), F.R. Civ. Pro. In fact, the 
motion also might properly be viewed as one for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In any event, no genuine issue 
of material fact appears to preclude judgment in defendants' favor pursuant to Rule 56. "

833,12," The trial court's charge to the jury on tying was as follows: A tying arrangement exists when a seller refuses to sell one product except on the condition that the buyer also purchase 
from the seller some other product, or service, which the buyer does not need or want, where the effect may be to 
substantially lessen competition. Tying arrangements are considered to be naturally anti-competitive since they deny free 
access to the market for the unwanted product, not because the party imposing the tying arrangement has a better product 
or a lower price, but because it has the power to force a product upon the purchaser. To constitute an illegal tying 
agreement, however, it is not enough that the seller simply possess economic power. That power must have been used to 
force the purchase of some unwanted product. There can be no illegal tie unless unlawful conduct by the seller influences 
the buyer's choice. For an antitrust violation, it is not necessary that the tying arrangement force a purchaser to buy only the 
product of the seller, but only that the amount of trade foreclosed by the agreement is more than merely insubstantial. Moreover, a manufacturer may require its distributor to promote to customers all its products so long as the purchase of 
one product of the manufacturer is not tied to the purchase of another of the manufacturer's products. Plaintiff alleges that the provisions of the distributor and dealer agreements and their interpretation by VWOA imposed the 
requirement on the distributors and dealers to purchase reasonable inventories of first Delanair and then VPC air 
conditioners and to promote the sale of these air conditioners, regardless of whether the distributors and dealers in fact 
wished to buy these VWOA approved air conditioners on the basis of the merits of the Delanair-VPC air conditioner when 
compared to the merits of the competing brands. The defendants deny this allegation saying that they have never required 
Volkswagen distributors and dealers to purchase Delanair-VPC air conditioners as a condition to purchasing Volkswagen 
automobiles. Second, they allege that they have never enforced the provisions of the distributor and dealer agreements 
relating to the promotion of approved parts and accessories and that they have never used any economic power to force 
distributors or dealers into buying Delanair-VPC air conditioners. On the contrary, defendants contend, as a practical 
matter, Volkswagen distributors and dealers have always been free to purchase any brand of air conditioner they desire. Therefore, you must consider if, based on the evidence you have heard, it is more likely than not that Volkswagen 
distributors and dealers have purchased Delanair-VPC air conditioners because VWOA required them to do so as a 
condition to their also purchasing Volkswagen automobiles. Even if you find the existence of a tying agreement, no violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act should be found if you find 
such arrangement was reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill of the Volkswagen vehicles or trademarks. The 
protection of goodwill is a reasonable basis to justify an otherwise unlawful tying agreement. To establish this defense, the 
defendants have the burden to show that these provisions were reasonably necessary to assure that the products identified 
by the Volkswagen trademarks were available at the places identified by such trademarks to assure adequate service and 
parts to such products, or to provide quality products. If you have found that a tying arrangement exists but that the provisions of the franchise agreement were reasonably 
necessary to protect the defendants' goodwill, then you cannot find that the provisions of the franchise agreement violated 
Section 1. On the other hand, if you found that a tying arrangement exists and if you believe that these provisions were not 
reasonably necessary to protect Volkswagen's goodwill, then you must find a violation of Section 1. "

839,19," There was, for example, evidence of Delanair's continued decline; of the growing dissatisfaction with the Delanair unit, with no 
sign of improvement; there was no evidence of new entrants into the market, so as to dispel evidence that market share would 
remain the same; there was evidence regarding the merits and weaknesses of the different competing units, there was also 
evidence that Heatransfer would have produced and marketed air-conditioning units for Volkswagen Types 2, 3, 4, and Audi 
during the damage period, and had, in fact, begun to design units for Types 2 and 3. "
841,20," [Plaintiff's Market Share] Defendants attack the jury's assumption that Heatransfer's portion of the total sales relative to the other competitors would have 
remained constant during the damage period but for the unlawful activities of the defendants. They allege that such an 
assumption is speculative and contrary to the evidence because it fails to consider new entrants into the market and because it 
fails to take into account the sales Heatransfer would have lost to DPD. The assumption that Heatransfer's market share would remain constant is not contrary to the evidence. First, there is no 
evidence of any potential new entrants into the market. Second, although there is some evidence to the effect that the 
relationship between DPD and Heatransfer changed with regard to their respective market shares, there is also evidence that 
this was the result of the newer company's inability to establish itself because of the defendants' anti-competitive practices. 
Furthermore, during the course of the trial, the jury was presented evidence regarding methods of marketing, the merits and 
weaknesses of each individual competitor's product, the trends developing within the market, etc. It cannot be said that the 
inference that plaintiff's sales would have remained constant was made by the jury without a proper consideration of market 
conditions.  Accordingly, the jury's determination to infer that the market shares of each competitor would remain constant 
cannot be said to be contrary to the evidence or to rest on speculation and guesswork. [New Products] Defendants also challenge the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury's assumption that plaintiff would have had the same 
success in marketing units for other models as it had in marketing its Type I unit.  Although the evidence to support this 
assumption is not extensive, it is supported by the testimony of Bill Lende who testified that it was necessary to have a full line of 
air conditioners for the Volkswagen family in order to sell any one type of unit. Lende attributed this necessity to the fact that 
dealers generally preferred to purchase a full line of products from one manufacturer in order to assure the availability of spare 
parts and service. Based upon this testimony, it was reasonable for a jury to infer that a manufacturer's customer for Type I units 
would remain his customer in purchasing units for other vehicles. The Court finds no merit in defendants' argument that the volume of unit sales during the damage period would be less than that 
actually achieved if VPC had not been a competitor within the relevant market. Although there is evidence demonstrating that 
VPC did develop new units and did organize an active sales force, it is also readily apparent from the record that other 
manufacturers were engaged in development of new units to the same extent of [sic] VPC. Indeed, DPD preceded VPC in some 
instances.  Furthermore, there is no evidence to indicate that the tenacity of the VPC sales force was any greater than that 
attributable to other manufacturers. Accordingly, the inference that the size of the market would remain the same without the 
acquisition of Delanair by VWAG is reasonable and supported by sufficient evidence. [Damages After Quitting Business] Lastly, defendants argue that damages cannot be awarded to the plaintiff for that period of time subsequent to Lende's decision 
to withdraw from competition with VPC. The fact that Lende voluntarily withdrew from the market is irrelevant in determining if 
plaintiff is entitled to recover damages. HN28[
] ""The antitrust law does not require a plaintiff to retain possession of a business oppressed by antitrust violation until the business is bankrupt or directly shut down by the violator."" Pollock & Riley, Inc. 
v. Pearl Brewing Co. [1974-2 Trade Cases para. 75,191], 498 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1974); accord Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp.

(1972). The question of whether the plaintiff withdrew from the market because it was forced out by the actions of the defendant 
or whether it withdrew for other reasons was an issue of fact to be determined by the jury in responding to the interrogatory 
relative to causation. Upon a finding that the defendants' conduct caused the plaintiff's injury, an award for damages subsequent 
to the plaintiff's withdrawal from the market is not erroneous. ELEMENTS OF DAMAGES RECOVERABLE AS A MATTER OF LAWSales and Profits Allegedly Lost to DPD "
842,," Defendants argue that a certain percentage of plaintiff's damage calculations premised upon Method II is unrecoverable 
because it represents sales lost to DPD rather than VPC. The Court has carefully reviewed the defendants' calculations 
submitted in support of their argument and finds that they are inconsistent with the damage formula that forms the basis for 
Method II. Method II was premised upon total industry sales; however, defendants' calculations do not include sales made by 
VPC. Accordingly, the Court finds the defendants' argument to be devoid of merit.Lost Capital Value Defendants ask the Court to remit a portion of the damages awarded by the jury that may be attributable to lost capital value. 
This request is premised upon their argument that lost capital value should be calculated as of April, 1970, the date that Lende 
decided to concentrate on marketing the Heatransfer unit in the ""aftermarket"", rather than the date of trial. Plaintiff is correct in assessing lost capital value as of the date of trial, rather than April, 1970. HN29[
] Lost capital value is to 
be determined at the date that a business ceases to do business. See, e.g., Farmington Dowel Products Co. v. Forster 
Manufacturing Co. [1970 Trade Cases para. 73,075], 421 F.2d 61 (1st Cir. 1969). In the instant case, plaintiff's decision in April, 
1970, is no indication that plaintiff ceased doing business altogether. In this regard, the evidence demonstrated that Heatransfer 
continued to compete in the relevant market long after the April, 1970, date and even attempted to reenter the market in 1973, 
only to find that the previous anti-competitive conditions continued to exist.  Because Heatransfer continued to exist and, to 
some extent, compete until the time of trial, even though it was terminating its operations at that time, lost capital value was 
properly assessed as of the trial date. [Interest] Additionally, defendants challenge the inclusion in the claim for damages of $326,000.00 in interest on the capital value 
computation, arguing that prejudgment interest is not allowable as a matter of law.  Plaintiff supports this award by arguing that 
the damage figure for interest does not represent prejudgment interest but is simply a vehicle for establishing capital value loss 
at the date of trial. In this regard, plaintiff, through its expert witness, demonstrated what its capital value loss would be as of 
December 31, 1973. Then, because figures for lost sales and profits were not available for the eight-month period of 1974 prior 
to trial, plaintiff's expert calculated lost capital value as of the date of trial by adding to the figure for December 31, 1973, an 
amount equal to a reasonable return on the capital loss value as of December 31, 1973, for the eight-month period of 1974. In the light of this explanation, the Court does not find that the portion of the damage award labeled ""interest"" can be considered 
""prejudgment interest"" that is prohibited as a matter of law. Further, although the Court does entertain some reservations with 
regard to the determination of capital loss value in this manner, it appears that remittitur of the sum labeled interest would result 
in no change in the judgment in view of the applicable rule in this Circuit that HN30[
] a court may not remit damages below 
that a jury might have awarded. See, Jenkins v. Aquatic Contractors & Engineers, 446 F.2d 520 (5th Cir. 1971); Glazer v. 
Glazer, 278 F. Supp. 476 (E.D.La.1968). In this regard, the $5,000,000 verdict is less than the jury might have awarded, even if 
the interest figure were not included in the damage claim. Accordingly, remittitur premised upon the inclusion of interest on the 
capital value loss in the damage claim will be denied.Profits from the Sale of ""Other Model"" Units [Preparedness and Intentions] Defendants ask that the Court remit that portion of the damage award attributable to profits from the lost sales of units for ""other 
models"" because the plaintiff lacked the necessary ""business or property"" interest in the sale of units for vehicles other than 
Type I to permit the plaintiff to recover damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act. This request is based upon the argument that the 
plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficiently that it had the preparedness and intention to engage in the manufacture of these 
additional units, a status that is necessary before an injured party who is about to engage in a business or to expand an existing 
business must prove before he has standing to claim that he has been injured. In response, plaintiff admits that it never took affirmative steps in manufacturing these units. However, it argues that proof of 
preparedness and intention is relevant only to the threshold question of standing and that it has adequately demonstrated its 
standing through proof that Heatransfer was a going concern engaged in the manufacture of air conditioners for Volkswagen 
automobiles. In this regard, plaintiff asserts that the question of whether it can recover for lost sales for types of units that it 
never manufactured is a question relative only to the damage portion of the trial and thus does not subject it to the heavier 
burden of proof for standing of preparedness and intention to enter a business. It is undisputed that HN31[
] a plaintiff who has attempted to enter a market but who has not succeeded must demonstrate his 
preparedness and intention to enter that market before he may recover damages for an antitrust violation that foreclosed the "
843,," market to him. See e.g., Martin v. Phillips Petroleum Co. [1966 Trade Cases para. 71,845], 365 F.2d 629 (5th Cir. 1966). 
Furthermore, even though an antitrust plaintiff operates a going concern, he must demonstrate his preparedness and intent to 
expand that business into a new market if he claims that expansion of that business into a new market has been foreclosed to 
him by the monopolistic activities of the defendant. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research [1969 Trade Cases para. 
72,800], 395 U.S. 100 [89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129] (1969); Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Co. [1962 Trade Cases 
para. 70,451], 308 F.2d 383 (6th Cir. 1962). However, the Court does not believe that a going concern, which is the victim of an 
anti-competitive practice, must forego damages for sales it would have made as the result of the natural expansion of its 
business simply because it was victimized early in its existence before its attempts to expand could ripen into evidence of 
preparedness and intent to increase its output. Thus, the question for the Court's determination is whether, under the facts of the 
present case, the manufacture of units for each type of Volkswagen vehicle in the relevant market can be considered the 
expansion of a present business into a new market for purposes of standing, or simply one facet of growth in an ongoing 
business for purposes of damages. The line to be drawn between expansion into new areas and growth in established ones is 
not easily defined and one that must be determined from the facts of each case. In the present case, the Court, after much consideration, finds that the sale of ""other model"" units should be considered as a 
damage issue.  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that it had a business or property interest in a going concern that had the 
manufacturing capacity and the market for units for the entire Volkswagen family of automobiles.  Testimony at the trial indicated 
that Volkswagen dealers expected an air conditioner manufacturer to develop a complete line and that these dealers preferred to 
deal with only one manufacturer who manufactured an entire line to satisfy their needs. It appears that the two major competitors 
in the market, DPD and VPC, developed additional units during the damage period, even though they manufactured during the 
base period just about the same variety of units as Heatransfer. Thus, the likelihood for growth and expansion of a business 
such as that of Heatransfer is evident. Furthermore, there is evidence to indicate that the various features and components of the units actually manufactured by 
Heatransfer could be utilized, with some design changes, in additional units that Heatransfer never produced. It does not appear 
that the manufacturing facilities would have to have been modified to any significant degree in order to accommodate different 
unit types. Nor does it appear that the plaintiff would have had to obtain new contract rights or additional sources of financing in 
order to expand. Thus, the history of the expansion and growth patterns of other competitors in the relevant market, the fact that production 
facilities did not have to be varied significantly, and the fact that customers for one unit would in all likelihood remain customers 
for other units lead this Court to the conclusion that the addition of other product lines must be considered as growth of a 
company for purposes of damages rather than expansion into new areas for purposes of determining standing. In this regard, 
the proper standard for considering if the jury award for lost sales of these units is supported by the evidence is whether or not 
such an award is based upon more than mere speculation and guesswork and not whether plaintiff has carried the more difficult 
burden in proving standing of showing that plaintiff had the preparedness and intent to expand in these areas. The Court does not find for the above stated reasons that the assumption that Heatransfer would have expanded is based upon 
speculation or guesswork. Furthermore, the Court does not find that the application of the Heatransfer markup for its Type I units 
to the VPC prices for these additional units in determining lost profits and manufacturing costs makes the award speculative. 
There is evidence to the effect that this markup would have been higher if the plaintiff had based its calculations upon anything 
other than its Type I markup. Although the profits for these additional units cannot be assessed with complete accuracy, the use 
of the Type I profit margin in assessing lost profits resulted in a reasonable award under the circumstances of this case."

] the jury should not be advised of the mandatory tripling provision of 15 U.S.C.A. § 15. The primary policy supporting our decision is that underpinning the tripling provision itself. The purpose of treble damage is to 
deter violations and encourage private enforcement of the anti-trust laws. The justifiable fear of anti-trust plaintiffs is that the 
juries will adjust the damage award downward or find no liability, therefore thwarting Congress's purpose, because of some 
notions of a windfall to the plaintiff. One court has even suggested that a jury might take the revelation of the treble damage 
provision as an intimation from the court to restrict the amount of damages. In sum, we agree with the Court of Appeals for 
the Tenth Circuit that informing a jury would serve no useful function and its probable consequence would be harmful - an 
impermissible lowering of the amount of damages. ""Second, HN35[
] it is not for the jury to determine the amount of a judgment.  Its function is to compute the amount of 
damages. Congress's authorization in 15 U.S.C.A. § 15 to triple the award of damages is a matter of law to be applied by 
the district court without interference from the jury. The fact that the awarded amount will be tripled has no relevance in 
determining the amount a plaintiff was injured by the anti-trust violation."" (Footnotes omitted). Pollock & Riley, Inc. v. Pearl Brewing Company, 498 F.2d 1240, 1242-1243 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied sub nom., 420 U.S.

852,1," Footnoted material referred to on page 16 of the Memorandum Opinion and Order. The distinction being urged here between the burden of proving civil and criminal violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act is 
well illustrated by United States v. Container Corp. of America, Inc., supra. In that case, a civil proceeding, an informal tacit 
agreement among competitors to exchange price information on their charges to specific customers was held to be price-fixing. 
This holding was based on the economic effects of the arrangement -- viz., the stabilization of market prices.  In other words, 
otherwise neutral activities became an unlawful price-fixing scheme because of their economic effects.  Evidence in the record 
indicated that the defendants actually may have exchanged price information so that they could undercut each other.  If in fact 
the defendants were exchanging price information in order to undercut the competition, then clearly they did not have a specific 
intent to fix prices, and they should not be subject to felony penalties.  Had Container Corp. been a criminal proceeding brought 
after the 1974 amendment, this evidence should have been admitted as weighing against any inferences of anticompetitive 
intent which could be drawn from the foreseeability of price stabilization. "
859,*," Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Lawrence T. Zimmerman for the Associated Equipment Distributors; by 
Lloyd N. Cutler, James S. Campbell, William T. Lake, and Donald F. Turner for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn.; and by 
Philip F. Zeidman and John A. Dienelt for the International Franchise Assn. "
860,1," RCA at that time was the dominant firm with as much as 60% to 70% of national television sales in an industry with more than 
100 manufacturers."
860,2," The number of retailers selling Sylvania products declined significantly as a result of the change, but in 1965 there were at least 
two franchised Sylvania retailers in each metropolitan center of more than 100,000 population."
860,3, Sylvania imposed no restrictions on the right of the franchisee to sell the products of competing manufacturers.
860,4, Sylvania's market share in San Francisco was approximately 2.5%-half its national and northern California average.
860,5," There are in fact four corporate petitioners: Continental T.V. Inc., A & G Sales, Sylpac, Inc., and S. A. M. Industries, Inc. All are 
owned in large part by the same individual, and all conducted business under the trade style of ""Continental T. V."" We adopt the 
convention used by the court below of referring to petitioners collectively as ""Continental."""
860,6," Sylvania had achieved exceptional results in Sacramento, where its market share exceeded 15% in 1965."
860,7," In its findings of fact made in conjunction with Continental's plea for injunctive relief, the District Court rejected Sylvania's claim 
that its actions were prompted by independent concerns over Continental's credit.  The jury's verdict is ambiguous on this point.  
In any event, we do not consider it relevant to the issue before us. "
861,8," Although Sylvania contended in the District Court that its policy was unilaterally enforced, it now concedes that its location 
restriction involved understandings or agreements with the retailers."
861,9," The jury also found that Maguire had not conspired with Sylvania with respect to this violation.  Other claims made by 
Continental were either rejected by the jury or withdrawn by Continental.  Most important was the jury's rejection of the allegation 
that the location restriction was part of a larger scheme to fix prices.  A pendent claim that Sylvania and Maguire had willfully and 
maliciously caused injury to Continental's business in violation of California law also was rejected by the jury, and a pendent 
breach-of-contract claim was withdrawn by Continental during the course of the proceedings.  The parties eventually stipulated 
to a judgment for Maguire on its claim against Continental."
861,10," There were two major dissenting opinions.  Judge Kilkenny argued that the present case is indistinguishable from Schwinn 
and that the jury had been correctly instructed.  Agreeing with Judge Kilkenny's interpretation of Schwinn, Judge Browning 
stated that he found the interpretation responsive to and justified by the need to protect ""'individual traders from unnecessary 
restrictions upon their freedom of action.'"" 537 F.2d, at 1021. See n. 21, infra."
861,11," This Court has never given plenary consideration to the question of the proper antitrust analysis of location restrictions.  
Before Schwinn such restrictions had been sustained in Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 124 F.2d 822 (CA2 1942). 
Since the decision in Schwinn, location restrictions have been sustained by three Courts of Appeals, including the decision 
below.  Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F.2d 567 (CA10 1975); Kaiser v. General Motors Corp, 396 F.Supp. 33 (ED 
Pa. 1975), affirmance order, 530 F.2d 964 (CA3 1976). "
863,12," The distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals and endorsed in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's separate opinion have no basis in 
Schwinn. The intrabrand competitive impact of the restrictions at issue in Schwinn ranged from complete elimination to mere 
reduction; yet, the Court did not even hint at any distinction on this ground.  Similarly, there is no suggestion that the per se rule 
was applied because of Schwinn's prominent position in its industry.  That position was the same whether the bicycles were sold 
or consigned, but the Court's analysis was quite different.  In light of MR. JUSTICE WHITE's emphasis on the ""superior 
consumer acceptance"" enjoyed by the Schwinn brand name, post, at 63, we note that the Court rejected precisely that premise 
in Schwinn. Applying the rule of reason to the restrictions imposed in nonsale transactions, the Court stressed that there was ""no 
showing that [competitive bicycles were] not in all respects reasonably interchangeable as articles of competitive commerce with "
864,," the Schwinn product"" and that it did ""not regard Schwinn's claim of product excellence as establishing the contrary."" 388 U.S.., 
at 381, and n. 7. Although Schwinn did hint at preferential treatment for new entrants and failing firms, the District Court below 
did not even submit Sylvania's claim that it was failing to the jury.  Accordingly, MR. JUSTICE WHITE's position appears to 
reflect an extension of Schwinn in this regard.  Having crossed the ""failing firm"" line, MR. JUSTICE WHITE attempts neither to 
draw a new one nor to explain why one should be drawn at all."
864,13," A former Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division has described Schwinn as ""an exercise in barren 
formalism"" that is ""artificial and unresponsive to the competitive needs of the real world."" Baker, Vertical Restraints in Times of 
Change: From White to Schwinn to Where?, 44 Antitrust L.J. 537 (1975). See, e.g., Handler, The Twentieth Annual Antitrust

864,14," Indeed, as one commentator has observed, many courts ""have struggled to distinguish or limit Schwinn in ways that are a 
tribute to judicial ingenuity."" Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 272.  Thus, the statement in Schwinn that post-sale vertical restrictions as 
to customers or territories are ""unreasonable without more,"" 388 U. S., at 379, has been interpreted to allow an exception to the 
per se rule where the manufacturer proves ""more"" by showing that the restraints will protect consumers against injury and the 
manufacturer against product liability claims.  See, e.g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932, 936-938 (CA3 1970) (en banc).  
Similarly, the statement that Schwinn's enforcement of its restrictions had been ""'firm and resolute,'"" 388 U. S., at 372, has been 
relied upon to distinguish cases lacking that element.  See, e.g., Janel Sales Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc., 396 F.2d 398, 406 
(CA2 1968). Other factual distinctions have been drawn to justify upholding territorial restrictions that would seem to fall within 
the scope of the Schwinn per se rule. See, e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. United States, 196 Ct. Cl. 35, 44-46, 449 F.2d 1374, 
1379-1380 (1971) (per se rule inapplicable when purchaser can avoid restraints by electing to buy product at higher price); 
Colorado Pump & Supply Co. v. Febco, Inc., 472 F.2d 637 (CA10 1973) (apparent territorial restriction characterized as primary 
responsibility clause).  One Court of Appeals has expressly urged us to consider the need in this area for greater flexibility.  
Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC, 497 F.2d 1178, 1187 (CA10 1974). The decision in Schwinn and the developments in the lower courts 
have been exhaustively surveyed in ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand 
Competition (1977) (ABA Monograph No. 2). "
865,15," One of the most frequently cited statements of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade v. 
United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918): ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition 
or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must ordinarily 
consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was 
imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the 
reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.  This is not because a 
good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the 
court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."""
865,16," HN3[
] Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial 
practices.  The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences 
must be balanced against its procompetitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule 
reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to 
identify them.  Once established, per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens 
on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 5; United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609-610 (1972), but those advantages are not sufficient in 
themselves to justify the creation of per se rules.  If it were otherwise, all of antitrust law would be reduced to per se rules, thus 
introducing an unintended and undesirable rigidity in the law."
865,17," After White Motor Co., the Courts of Appeals continued to evaluate territorial restrictions according to the rule of reason. 
Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 847 (CA6 1964); Snap-On Tools Corp. v. FTC, 321 F.2d 825 (CA7 1963). For an exposition of the 
history of the antitrust analysis of vertical restrictions before Schwinn, see ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 6-8. "
866,18," As in Schwinn, we are concerned here only with nonprice vertical restrictions.  The per se illegality of price restrictions has 
been established firmly for many years and involves significantly different questions of analysis and policy.  As MR. JUSTICE 
WHITE notes, post, at 69-70, some commentators have argued that the manufacturer's motivation for imposing vertical price 
restrictions may be the same as for nonprice restrictions.  There are, however, significant differences that could easily justify 
different treatment.  In his concurring opinion in White Motor Co. v. United States, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN noted that, unlike 
nonprice restrictions, ""[r]esale price maintenance is not only designed to, but almost invariably does in fact, reduce price 
competition not only among sellers of the affected product, but quite as much between that product and competing brands."" 372 
U.S. 268. Professor Posner also recognized that ""industrywide resale price maintenance might facilitate cartelizing."" Posner, 
supra, n. 13, at 294 (footnote omitted); see R. Posner, Antitrust: Cases, Economic Notes and Other Materials 134 (1974); E. 
Gellhorn, Antitrust Law and Economics 252 (1976); Note, 10 Colum. J. L. & Soc. Prob., supra, n. 13, at 498 n. 12.  
Furthermore, Congress recently has expressed its approval of a per se analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those 
provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair trade pricing at the option of the individual States.  Consumer 
Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801, amending 15 U.S.C.  §§ 1, 45(a).  No similar expression of congressional intent exists 
for nonprice restrictions."
866,19," Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product - television sets in this case - 
and is the primary concern of antitrust law.  The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where 
there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors - wholesale or 
retail - of the product of a particular manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the manufacturer. 
Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a monopolist and no 
intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry.  But when 
interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of 
intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product."
866,20," The Court did not specifically refer to intrabrand competition, but this meaning is clear from the context."
866,21," The Court also stated that to impose vertical restrictions in sale transactions would ""violate the ancient rule against restraints 
on alienation."" 388 U. S., at 380. This isolated reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the commentators on 
the decision, most of whom have regarded the Court's apparent reliance on the ""ancient rule"" as both a misreading of legal 
history and a perversion of antitrust analysis.  See, e.g., Handler, supra, n. 13, at 1684-1686; Posner, supra, n. 13, at 295-296; 
Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 270-271; but see Louis, supra, n. 13, at 276 n. 6.  We quite agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART's 
dissenting comment in Schwinn that ""the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: 
the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today."" 388 U. S., at 392. We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning's interpretation of Schwinn. In his dissent below he argued that the decision 
reflects the view that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of independent businessmen even 
though they have no impact on ""price, quality, and quantity of goods and services,"" 537 F.2d, at 1019. This view is certainly not 
explicit in Schwinn,which purports to be based on an examination of the ""impact [of the restrictions] upon the marketplace."" 388 
U. S., at 374. Competitive economies have social and political as well as economic advantages, see e.g., Northern Pac. R. Co. "
867,," v. United States, 356 U. S., at 4, but an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective 
benchmarks.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis reminded us: ""Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains.  To 
bind, to restrain, is of their very essence."" Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S., at 238. Although MR. JUSTICE 
WHITE's opinion endorses Judge Browning's interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to distinguish Schwinn on grounds 
inconsistent with that interpretation, post, at 71."
867,22," In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more complete prohibition ""might severely hamper smaller enterprises 
resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the competition of giants and of merchandising through independent dealers."" 388 
U. S., at 380. The Court also broadly hinted that it would recognize additional exceptions to the per se rule for new entrants in an 
industry and for failing firms, both of which were mentioned in White Motor as candidates for such exceptions.  388 U.S., at 374. 
The Court might have limited the exceptions to the per se rule to these situations, which present the strongest arguments for the 
sacrifice of intrabrand competition for interbrand competition.  Significantly, it chose instead to create the more extensive 
exception for nonsale transactions which is available to all businesses, regardless of their size, financial health, or market share. 
This broader exception demonstrates even more clearly the Court's awareness of the ""redeeming virtues"" of vertical restrictions."
867,23," Marketing efficiency is not the only legitimate reason for a manufacturer's desire to exert control over the manner in which his 
products are sold and serviced.  As a result of statutory and common-law developments, society increasingly demands that 
manufacturers assume direct responsibility for the safety and quality of their products.  For example, at the federal level, apart 
from more specialized requirements, manufacturers of consumer products have safety responsibilities under the Consumer 
Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 2051 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V), and obligations for warranties under the Consumer Product 
Warranties Act, 15 U. S. C.  § 2301 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Similar obligations are imposed by state law.  See, e.g., Cal. 
Civ. Code § 1790 et seq. (West 1973).  The legitimacy of these concerns has been recognized in cases involving vertical 
restrictions.  See, e.g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970). "
868,24," ""Generally a manufacturer would prefer the lowest retail price possible, once its price to dealers has been set, because a 
lower retail price means increased sales and higher manufacturer revenues."" Note, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 636, 641 (1975). In this 
context, a manufacturer is likely to view the difference between the price at which it sells to its retailers and their price to the 
consumer as its ""cost of distribution,"" which it would prefer to minimize.  Posner, supra, n. 13, at 283."
868,25," Professor Comanor argues that the promotional activities encouraged by vertical restrictions result in product differentiation 
and, therefore, a decrease in interbrand competition.  This argument is flawed by its necessary assumption that a large part of 
the promotional efforts resulting from vertical restrictions will not convey socially desirable information about product availability, 
price, quality, and services.  Nor is it clear that a per se rule would result in anything more than a shift to less efficient methods of 
obtaining the same promotional effects."
868,26," We also note that per se rules in this area may work to the ultimate detriment of the small businessmen who operate as 
franchisees. To the extent that a per se rule prevents a firm from using the franchise system to achieve efficiencies that it 
perceives as important to its successful operation, the rule creates an incentive for vertical integration into the distribution 
system, thereby eliminating to that extent the role of independent businessmen.  See, e.g., Keck, The Schwinn Case, 23 Bus. 
Law. 669 (1968); Pollock, supra, n. 13, at 608-610."
868,27," Continental's contention that balancing intrabrand and interbrand competitive effects of vertical restrictions is not a ""proper part 
of the judicial function,"" Brief for Petitioners 52, is refuted by Schwinn itself.  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S., at 
608, is not to the contrary, for it involved a horizontal restriction among ostensible competitors. "
869,28," There may be occasional problems in differentiating vertical restrictions from horizontal restrictions originating in agreements 
among the retailers. There is no doubt that restrictions in the latter category would be illegal per se, see, e.g., United States v. 
General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 (1966); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, but we do not regard the problems 
of proof as sufficiently great to justify a per se rule."
869,29," The location restriction used by Sylvania was neither the least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have used.  See 
ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 20-25.  But we agree with the implicit judgment in Schwinn that a per se rule based on the nature of 
the restriction is, in general, undesirable.  Although distinctions can be drawn among the frequently used restrictions, we are 
inclined to view them as differences of degree and form.  See Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 279-280; Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and 
Sherman One: An Analysis and Prognosis, 15 N. Y. L. F. 39, 65 (1969). We are unable to perceive significant social gain from 
channeling transactions into one form or another.  Finally, we agree with the Court in Schwinn that the advantages of vertical 
restrictions should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms.  Sylvania was faltering, if not failing, and we 
think it would be unduly artificial to deny it the use of valuable competitive tools."
869,30," The importance of stare decisis is, of course, unquestioned, but as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 
U. S. 106, 119 (1940), ""STARE DECISIS is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest 
decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its 
scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience."" "
870,1," The franchised retailers would be prevented from engaging in discounting themselves if, under the Colgate doctrine, see infra, 
at 67, the manufacturer could lawfully terminate dealers who did not adhere to his suggested retail price."
870,2," Given the Government's emphasis on the inhibiting effect of the Schwinn restrictions on discounting activities, the Court may 
well have been referring to this effect when it condemned the restrictions as ""obviously destructive of competition."" 388 U. S., at 
379. But the Court was also heavily influenced by its concern for the freedom of dealers to control the disposition of products 
they purchased from Schwinn.  See infra, at 66-69.  In any event, the record in Schwinn illustrates the potentially greater threat 
to intrabrand competition posed by customer as opposed to location restrictions. "
871,3," Relying on the finding of the District Court, the Government argued: ""[T]he declared purpose of the Schwinn franchising system [was] to establish and exploit a distinctive identity and superior 
consumer acceptance for the Schwinn brand name as the Cadillac of bicycles, thereby enabling the charging of a premium 
price….  This scheme could not possibly succeed, and doubtless would long ago have been abandoned, if in the consumer's 
mind other bicycles were just as good as Schwinn's."" Brief for United States, O.T. 1966, No. 25, p. 36."
871,4," See, e.g., F. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economics Performance 10-11 (1970); P. Samuelson, Economics 485-
491 (10th ed. 1976). "
872,5," Schwinn's national market share declined to 12.8% in the 10 years following the institution of its distribution program, at which 
time it ranked second behind a firm with a 22.8% share.  388 U. S., at 368-369. In the three years following the adoption of its 
locations practice, Sylvania's national market share increased to 5%, placing it eighth among manufacturers of color television 
sets.  Ante, at 38-39.  At this time Sylvania's shares of the San Francisco, Sacramento, and northern California markets were 
respectively 2.5%, 15%, and 5%.  Ante, at 39 nn. 4, 6.  The District Court made no findings as to Schwinn's share of local bicycle 
markets."

Schwinn and Sylvania as a basis for distinguishing these cases is the more anomalous for its reliance, see infra, at 68-70, on the 
economic analysis of those who distinguish the anticompetitive effects of distribution restraints on the basis of the market shares 
of the distributors. See Posner, supra, at 299; Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price Fixing and Market

874,10," Professor Posner writes, for example: ""There is no basis for choosing between [price fixing and market division] on social grounds.  If resale price maintenance is like 
dealer price fixing, and therefore bad, a manufacturer's assignment of exclusive sales territories is like market division, and 
therefore bad too…. .  .  . ""[If helping new entrants break into a market] is a good justification for exclusive territories, it is an equally good justification for 
resale price maintenance, which as we have seen is simply another method of dealing with the free-rider problem….  In fact, any 
argument that can be made on behalf of exclusive territories can also be made on behalf of resale price maintenance."" Posner,

881,1," In addition to respondents Stoner and Stoner Manufacturing, petitioner also sued respondent Lektro-Vend Corp.  Lektro-Vend 
had developed a radically new vending machine, and it was Stoner's relationship with Lektro-Vend that formed the basis of the 
lawsuit."
881,2," The Court of Appeals' summary of the state-court litigation is illustrative: ""The suit was filed in Kane County, Illinois on August 10, 1965; the complaint charged breach of noncompetition covenants; an 
amended complaint also charged theft of trade secrets.  After a bench trial the court on December 16, 1966 found for Vendo.  
Judgments against Stoner for $250,000 and against both defendants for $1,100,000 were granted.  Stoner and Stoner 
Investments were enjoined from further acts of competition. ""An appeal was taken to the Appellate Court of Illinois.  That court entered its decision on January 30, 1969,…  105 Ill. App. 2d 
261, 245 N.E. 2d 263. The court held that no trade secrets were involved, the noncompetition covenants were valid and 
enforceable, and the covenants had been breached by the defendants.  The grant of injunctive relief was affirmed.  The court "
882,," also held that though the trial court erred in striking the affirmative defense based on the federal antitrust laws, it was correct in 
denying the defense based on the Illinois antitrust laws. The cause was remanded for a determination of damages and further 
proceedings. ""Upon remand the defendant withdrew its affirmative defense asserted under the federal antitrust laws. The trial court, after 
hearing evidence, entered judgments against Stoner and Stoner Investments which totaled $7,363,500. ""Upon a second appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court, the court decided, on September 12, 1973, 13 Ill. App. 3d 291, 300 N.E. 
2d 632, that the trial court erred in the measurement of damages.  The case was remanded for assessment of damages in 
accordance with the Appellate Court's original opinion. ""Upon appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court on September 27, 1974,.  58 Ill. 2d 289, 321 N.E. 2d 1, the appellate court was 
reversed and the trial court's judgments were affirmed.  The Supreme Court in deciding the case constructed a different theory of 
recovery - the breach of a fiduciary obligation on the part of Stoner - than had been asserted by Vendo."" 545 F.2d 1050, 1055 n. 
4 (CA7 1976)."
882,3," ""Quite apart from any liability which may be predicated upon a breach of the covenants against competition contained in the 
sales agreement and the employment contract, it is clear that Stoner violated his fiduciary duties to plaintiff during the period 
when he was a director and an officer of plaintiff."" 58 Ill. 2d, at 303, 321 N.E. 2d, at 9."
882,4," This issue was not presented to this Court in the petition for certiorari, and the Court of Appeals did not discuss it in its opinion. "
884,5," Prior to the enactment of § 16, private injunctive relief was not authorized for antitrust violations.  Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, 
244 U.S. 459 (1917). As far as the legislative history indicates, the sole purpose of § 16 ( § 14 in the original drafts) was to 
extend to private parties the right to sue for injunctive relief. The following passage, taken in its entirety from H. R. Rep. No. 627, 
63d Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1914), demonstrates what Congress had in mind in enacting § 16: ""Section 14 authorizes a person, firm, or corporation or association to sue for and have injunctive relief against threatened loss 
or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against "
885,," threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity under the rules governing such proceedings.  
Under section 7 of the act of July 2, 1890, a person injured in his business and property by corporations or combinations acting 
in violation of the Sherman antitrust law, may recover loss and damage for such wrongful act.  There is, however, no provision 
in the existing law authorizing a person, firm, corporation, or association to enjoin threatened loss or damage to his business or 
property by the commission of such unlawful acts, and the purpose of this section is to remedy such defect in the law.  This 
provision is in keeping with the recommendation made by the President in his message to Congress on the subject of trusts and 
monopolies."" See also S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 17-18 (1914)."
885,6," In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972), this Court held that harassing and sham state-
court proceedings of a repetitive nature could be part of an anticompetitive scheme or conspiracy.  In Otter Tail Power Co. v. 
United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973), one of the allegations was that the federal-court defendant had instituted and supported 
state-court litigation for anticompetitive purposes in violation of the antitrust laws. The District Court had enjoined the defendant 
from ""[i]nstituting, supporting or engaging in litigation, directly or indirectly, against cities and towns, and officials thereof, which 
have voted to establish municipal power systems…."" Jurisdictional Statement, in No. O.T. 1972, 71-991, p. A-115.  This Court 
vacated and remanded to the District Court for consideration, in light of the intervening decision of California Motor Transport, of 
whether the state-court litigation came within the ""mere sham"" exception announced in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference 
v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127 (1961). Those cases together may be cited for the proposition that repetitive, sham 
litigation in state courts may constitute an antitrust violation and that an injunction may lie to enjoin future state-court litigation.  
However, neither of those cases involved the injunction of a pending state-court proceeding, and thus the bar of § 2283 was not 
brought into play. Nothing that we say today cuts back in any way on the holdings of these two cases; what we must here decide is whether such a 
lawsuit may be enjoined by a federal court after it has been commenced, notwithstanding the bar of the Anti-Injunction Act.  
While we conclude that it may not, nothing in our opinion today prevents a federal court in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction 
enjoin from the commencement of additional state-court proceedings if it concludes from the course and outcome of the first one 
that such proceedings would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. With respect to this future litigation, the injunction will 
prevent even the commencement of a second such action, and the principles of federalism do not require the bar of § 2283.  
This distinction is totally consistent with the realization that the true bona fides of the initial state-court litigation is often not 
apparent: ""One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may 
emerge which leads the fact finder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused."" California 
Motor Transport, supra, at 513. Any ""disadvantage"" to which the federal plaintiff is put in the initial proceeding is diminished by his ability to set up the federal 
antitrust claim as an affirmative defense, reviewable by this Court under 28 U.S.C.  § 1257 (3), and his ability to sue for treble 
damages resulting from the vexatious prosecution of that state-court litigation."
885,7," Petitioner has catalogued the following federal statutes, and suggests that each would be so affected: "

Petitioner 10-11, n. 7."
886,8," MR. JUSTICE STEVENS in his dissent, see post, at 649-654, would conclude that since certain types of state-court litigation 
may violate the antitrust laws, an injunction of such litigation while pending is ""expressly authorized"" under the provisions of the 
Anti-Injunction Act.  But this conclusion does not at all follow from the premise that judicial decisions have construed the 
prohibition of the antitrust laws to include sham and frivolous state-court proceedings - a premise with which we do not at all 
disagree, see n. 6, supra. The conclusion is supportable only as a matter of policy preference, and not of statutory construction.  
Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' view, all a federal court need do is find a violation of the federal statute, then by the very force 
of that finding ""express authorization"" for the statute would be presumed.  But this approach flies in the face of our past 
decisions.  For example, in Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 227 (1972), the petitioner had alleged that the state courts ""were 
depriving him of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments."" Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' syllogistic 
formulation, since the state-court action is a violation of § 1983, the express authorization would be readily found on the face of 
the statute.  However, the Court in Mitchum found no such ipso facto shortcut to the explicit prohibition of § 2283, but resorted to 
careful analysis of the legislative history in order to find evidence of congressional authorization. In short, MR. JUSTICE 
STEVENS' approach, which removes the bar of § 2283 from all federal injunctive statutes, is totally inconsistent with this Court's 
longstanding recognition that ""[l]egislative policy is here expressed in a clear-cut prohibition qualified only by specifically defined 
exceptions."" Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, 516 (1955). In reaching this conclusion, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS argues that the Anti-Injunction Act should be ""considered wholly 
inapplicable to later enacted federal statutes that are enforceable exclusively in federal litigation."" Post, at 659.  But this view is 
inconsistent with the approach adopted by the Court in Clothing Workers, supra. In that case, an employer had sought an 
injunction against a union in state court.  This Court found that the action before the state court was ""outside state authority,"" 348 
U.S., at 514, and that jurisdiction was vested solely in the National Labor Relations Board.  But the Court found that the 
exclusive federal jurisdiction was not sufficient to render § 2283 inapplicable.  See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive 
Engineers, 398 U.S. 281 (1970). We think MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' view tends to confuse the jurisdiction granted to federal courts by § 16 of the Clayton Act 
with the separate question of whether a court having such jurisdiction has also been ""expressly authorize[d""] to enjoin state-court 
proceedings.  Post, at 650-654.  But the question of whether an injunction against state-court proceedings has been ""expressly 
authorized"" under § 2283 never arises unless the federal court asked to issue the injunction has subject-matter jurisdiction of the 
case in which the injunction is sought.  Here the District Court is entirely free to proceed with the litigation on the merits of 
respondents' antitrust claim against petitioner, and to grant damages and such other relief as may be appropriate if it determines 
the issues in favor of respondents.  All that we conclude is that it may not include as a part of that relief an injunction against an 
already pending state-court proceeding. "
887,9," Much of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' dissenting opinion is an able brief for the conceded importance of the Sherman and Clayton 
Acts.  But however persuasive it might be in inducing Congress to lift the bar of § 2283 with respect to injunctions issued under § 
16, we do not believe it is persuasive in determining whether, under the present state of the law, Congress has in fact ""expressly 
authorized"" the injunction issued by the District Court here.  For example, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS laments that state-court 
proceedings may now become the vehicles by which an antitrust violator may put one independent businessman after another 
out of business.  See post, at 652-654, 657.  Federal courts are able to enjoin future repetitive litigation, see discussion of 
California Motor Transport and Otter Tail Power, supra, n. 6.  But even if one were to agree with this broad speculation, the 
solution is simple and straightforward.  If Congress determines that the use of state-court proceedings to foster anticompetitive 
schemes is of sufficient gravity, it may simply conclude that the need for greater antitrust enforcement outweighs the need to 
prevent friction in our federal system and amend § 16 to expressly authorize an injunction of state-court proceedings. No desire for more vigorous antitrust enforcement should cause us to lose sight of our role as judges in interpreting the explicit 
command of a congressional statute; for notwithstanding the rhetoric of the dissenting opinion, the conclusion that § 16 is an 
""expressly authorized"" exception to § 2283 is no more than an ipse dixit. The ""explicit wording of § 2283,"" Atlantic Coast Line R. 
Co., supra, at 297, is lost on the dissent; the dissent's approach is the clearest form of judicial improvisation which the Court 
counseled against in Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., supra, at 514."
887,10," A possible exception is Porter v. Dicken, 328 U.S. 252 (1946), regarding § 205(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.  
This Act, enacted in response to wartime exigencies, expired in 1947. "
889,*," I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE STEVENS post, at 661-662 that the examples given in the quoted portion of California Motor 
Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, necessarily involve the use of the adjudicatory process in the same way that the state 
courts were being used in this case.  For example, there is no reason to believe that the Court's reference to the use of a patent 
obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor contemplated only one lawsuit. The case cited in connection with that reference, 
Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172 (1965), held only that the enforcement of a 
patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office could state a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, where the monopolistic acts 
alleged included use of the fraudulent patent through a course of action involving both threats of suit and prosecution of an 
infringement suit. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' quotation from California Motor Transport stops just short of the language that I consider critical to the 
instant case.  The Court's opinion continues: ""Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process.  Opponents 
before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other's tactics, motions, or defenses and may readily call them baseless. One 
claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge 
which leads the fact finder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.  That may be a difficult 
line to discern and draw."" 404 U.S., at 513. Since I believe that federal courts should be hesitant indeed to enjoin ongoing state-court proceedings, I am of the opinion that a 
pattern of baseless, repetitive claims or some equivalent showing of grave abuse of the state courts must exist before an 
injunction would be proper.  No such finding was made by the District Court in this case. "
890,1," Specific findings of likelihood of ultimate success on the merits, likelihood of irreparable harm, a balance of the equities in favor 
of respondent-movants, and of protection of the public interest by issuance of the injunction are recited and substantiated in the 
District Court opinion.  403 F.Supp. 527, 532-538 (1975). The Court of Appeals affirmed, specifically rejecting petitioner's attack 
on the finding of a likelihood of ultimate success on the merits.  545 F.2d 1050, 1058-1059 (CA7 1976)."

Section of the American Bar Association."
890,3," It is well settled, and the District Court so held, that when the precise conduct proscribed by the antitrust laws is sought to be 
furthered by litigation, the antitrust laws forbid a court from giving judgment if to do so ""would be to make the courts a party to the 
carrying out of one of the very restraints forbidden by the Sherman Act."" Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 520. See 403 F.Supp.,

It does not go into detailed definitions which might either work injury to legitimate enterprise or through particularization defeat its 
purposes by providing loopholes for escape.  The restrictions the Act imposes are not mechanical or artificial.  Its general 
phrases, interpreted to attain its fundamental objects, set up the essential standard of reasonableness.  They call for vigilance in

these courts are limited in their jurisdiction to the State, and, in our complex system of government, are admitted to be unable to 
deal with the great evil that now threatens us. ""…  The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the United States to apply the same remedies against combinations which 
injuriously affect the interests of the United States that have been applied in the several States to protect local interests. ….. ""…  The committee therefore deemed it proper by express legislation to confer on the circuit courts of the United States original 
jurisdiction of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity arising under this section, with authority to issue all remedial 
process or writs proper and necessary to enforce its provisions…."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (1890).  Later the same day he said: 
[Congress] may 'regulate commerce;' can it not protect commerce, nullify contracts that restrain commerce, turn it from its 
natural courses, increase the price of articles, and therefore diminish the amount of commerce? ….. ""[The power of the 'combinations'] for mischief will be greatly crippled by this bill.  Their present plan of organization was adopted 
only to evade the jurisdiction of State courts. ….. ""Suppose one of these combinations should unite all, or nearly all, the domestic producers of an article of prime necessity with a 
view to prevent competition and to keep the price up to the foreign cost and duty added, would not this be in restraint of trade 
and commerce and affect injuriously the operation of our revenue laws?  Can Congress prescribe no remedy except to repeal its 
taxes?  Surely it may authorize the executive authorities to appeal to the courts of the United States for such a remedy, as courts 
habitually apply in the States for the forfeiture of charters thus abused and the punishment of officers who practice such wrongs 
to the public.  It may also give to our citizens the right to sue for such damages as they have suffered."" Id., at 2462.  Senator 
Sherman, 3 days later, discussing the rise of the ""combinations"" during the preceding 20 years, stated: ""…  The State courts have attempted to wrestle with this difficulty.  I produced decisions of the supreme courts of several of the 
States. ""Take the State of New York, where the sugar trust was composed of seventeen corporations.  What remedy had the people of 
New York in the suit that they had against that combination?  None whatever, except as against one corporation out of the 
seventeen.  No proceeding could be instituted in the State of New York by which all those corporations could be brought in one 
suit under the common jurisdiction of the United States.  No remedy could be extended by the courts, although they were eager 
and earnest in search of a remedy. ….. "
892,," ""…  When a man is injured by an unlawful combination why should he not have the power to sue in the courts of the United 
States? It would not answer to send him to a State court.  It would not answer at all to send him to a court of limited jurisdiction.  
Then, besides, it is a court of the United States that alone has jurisdiction over all parts of the United States.  The United States 
can send its writs into every part of a State and make parties in different States submit to its process.  The States can not do 
that."" Id., at 2568-2569. Similarly, in the House debate Congressman Culberson, floor sponsor of the bill, had this to say during his introductory remarks: ""If Congress will legislate within its sphere and to the limit to which it may go, and if the legislatures of the several States will do 
their duty and supplement that legislation, the trusts and combinations which are devouring the substance of the people of the 
country may be effectually suppressed.  The States are powerless unless Congress will take charge of the trade between the 
States and make unlawful traffic that operates in restraint of trade and which promotes and encourages monopoly."" Id., at 4091. See Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890, 23 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221 (1956)."

remedies which it provided were coextensive with such conceptions….  [T]he statute in express terms vested the Circuit Court[s]

establish a violation of the Act."
892,10," Although the kind of relief which is appropriate in private litigation may sometimes be different from that which the Government 
may obtain, cf.  United States v. Borden Co., 347 U.S. 514, 518-520, there is no difference in the scope of the jurisdictional grant 
to the federal court in the two kinds of cases: ""[T]he purpose of giving private parties treble-damage and injunctive remedies was not merely to provide private relief, but was 
to serve as well the high purpose of enforcing the antitrust laws. E.g., United States v. Borden Co., 347 U.S. 514, 518 (1954). 
Section 16 should be construed and applied with this purpose in mind….  Its availability should be 'conditioned by the

principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the 
rules governing such proceedings…,"" 38 Stat. 737, 15 U.S.C.  § 26. The legislative history of § 16 is thin.  In addition to the 
nearly identical House and Senate Reports, ante, at 634 n. 5, the following comments from the House debate provide some idea 
of the congressional intent.  Congressman McGillicuddy, a member of the Commerce Committee, described the perceived need: "
893,," ""Under the present law any person injured in his business or property by acts in violation of the Sherman antitrust law may 
recover his damage….  There is no provision under the present law, however, to prevent threatened loss or damage even 
though it be irreparable.  The practical effect of this is that a man would have to sit by and see his business ruined before he 
could take advantage of his remedy.  In what condition is such a man to take up a long and costly lawsuit to defend his rights? ""The proposed bill solves this problem for the person, firm, or corporation threatened with loss or damage to property by 
providing injunctive relief against the threatened act that will cause such loss or damage.  Under this most excellent provision a 
man does not have to wait until he is ruined in his business before he has his remedy."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9261 (1914). During consideration of the Conference Report Congressman Floyd described the scope of the § 16 remedy: ""[S]o that if a man is injured by a discriminatory contract, by a tying contract, by the unlawful acquisition of stock of competing 
corporations, or by reason of someone acting unlawfully as a director in two banks or other corporations, he can go into any 
court and enjoin or restrain the party from committing such unlawful acts."" Id., at 16319."

894,20," In litigation between a franchisee and franchisor the former may challenge the validity of various contract provisions under 
federal law, while the latter may rely heavily on state contract law as a basis for controlling the franchisee's conduct.  State 
proceedings to obtain possession of disputed premises or equipment are powerful weapons in such litigation, even when the 
federal court has the power to maintain the status quo.  See Chmieleski v. City Products Corp., 71 F.R.D. 118, 141-142, 158 
(WD Mo. 1976)."
894,21," The potential consequences of the plurality's view may perhaps best be illustrated by reference to a common-law decision that 
could not possibly survive scrutiny under the Sherman Act. In Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns & Ammunition Co., [1894] 
A.C. 535, the House of Lords held that a 25-year, worldwide covenant not to compete in the arms business was an enforceable 
bargain.  One of the parties to such a contract was therefore entitled to enjoin a breach of the agreement by another party.  If 
such common-law relief should be granted by a state court in a comparable situation, and if the plurality's interpretation of the 
statute were accepted, a federal court would be powerless to interfere with state proceedings to enforce such a judgment."
894,22," The text of the statute is quoted in n. 4, supra."
894,23," Rather surprisingly the plurality seems to regard Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, as supporting its 
position.  That case involved a construction of the portion of the Taft-Hartley Act that conferred jurisdiction on the National Labor 
Relations Board to obtain injunctive relief in certain situations.  The Court rejected the argument that the statute implicitly 
authorized similar relief for private parties: ""Congress explicitly gave such jurisdiction to the district courts only on behalf of the Board on a petition by it or 'the officer or 
regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred.' § 10 (j), (1), 61 Stat. 149, 29 U.S.C.  § 160 (j), (1).  To hold that the Taft-
Hartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to secure interim relief would be to ignore the closely circumscribed jurisdiction given 
to the District Court and to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.  To find exclusive authority for relief vested in the 
Board and not in private parties accords with other aspects of the Act."" Id., at 517. Since the statute did not expressly authorize the requested relief, it was obviously not within the ""expressly authorized"" 
exception to § 2283.  The fact that the Court simply read the relevant statutes literally in that case supports my view that we 
should use the same approach here. In Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281, on which the plurality also relies, the union did not even 
argue that injunctive relief was expressly authorized by federal statute.  It unsuccessfully contended ""that the federal injunction 
was proper either 'to protect or effectuate' the District Court's denial of an injunction in 1967, or as 'necessary in aid of' the 
District Court's jurisdiction."" Id., at 284. That case is wholly inapposite to the issue presented today. "
895,," The fact that these two cases provide the plurality with its strongest support emphasizes the dramatic character of its refusal to 
accept the plain meaning of the words Congress has written."
895,24," ""But the power of the District Courts to issue an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court is questioned, since, by the 
Judiciary Act of 1973, 1 Stat. 335, it was declared that no writ of injunction shall be granted [by the United States courts] 'to stay 
proceedings in any court of a State.' But the act of 1851 was a subsequent statute, and by the 4th section of this act - after 
providing for proceedings to be had under it for the benefit of ship owners, and after declaring that it shall be deemed a sufficient 
compliance with its requirements on their part if they shall transfer their interest in ship and freight for the benefit of the claimants 
to a trustee to be appointed by the court - it is expressly declared, that 'from and after [such] transfer all claims and proceedings 
against the owners shall cease.' Surely this injunction applies as well to 'claims and proceedings' in State courts as to those in 
the federal courts…."" 109 U.S., at 599-600."
895,25," The relevant portions of §§ 205(a) and (c) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 33, simply provided: ""SEC.  205. (a) Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator any person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or 
practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of section 4 of this Act, he may make application to the 
appropriate court for an order enjoining such acts or practices, or for an order enforcing compliance with such provision, and 
upon a showing by the Administrator that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices a 
permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order shall be granted without bond. .  .  . ""(c) The district courts shall have jurisdiction of criminal proceedings for violations of section 4 of this Act, and, concurrently with 
State and Territorial courts, of all other proceedings under section 205 of this Act."""
895,26," ""In the first place, it is evident that, in order to qualify under the 'expressly authorized' exception of the anti-injunction statute, a 
federal law need not contain an express reference to that statute.  As the Court has said, 'no prescribed formula is required; an 
authorization need not expressly refer to § 2283.' Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, 516. 
Indeed, none of the previously recognized statutory exceptions contains any such reference.  Secondly, a federal law need not 
expressly authorize an injunction of a state court proceeding in order to qualify as an exception.  Three of the six previously 
recognized statutory exceptions contain no such authorization. Thirdly, it is clear that, in order to qualify as an 'expressly 
authorized' exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or 
remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a 
state court proceeding.  This is not to say that in order to come within the exception an Act of Congress must, on its face and in 
every one of its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute.  The test, rather, is whether 
an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended 
scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding."" 407 U.S., at 237-238 (footnotes omitted)."
895,27," See n. 11, supra. "
896,28," Thus, the 1851 Act to limit the liability of shipowners, 9 Stat. 635, applied equally to ""preventing or arresting the prosecution of 
separate suits,"" see Providence & N.Y.S.S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U.S., 578, 596. The Interpleader Act, 28 U.S.C.§ 2361, in 
terms, applies equally to the ""instituting or prosecuting"" of other litigation.  In terms of the interest in federalism, since the 
injunction against litigation typically runs against the parties rather than the court, there is little difference between denying a 
citizen access to the state forum and denying him the right to prosecute an existing case to its conclusion.  In either situation, a 
federal injunction must rest on a determination that an important federal policy outweighs the interest in allowing a state court to 
resolve a particular controversy.  But when the federal policy does justify that conclusion, the timing of the state-court action 
should rarely be controlling."
896,29," See n. 7, supra."
896,30," It is true that when the Sherman Act was passed, Congress did not expressly address ""the possibility that state-court 
proceedings would be used to violate the Sherman or Clayton Acts."" Ante, at 634.  As the statute has been construed, however, 
it is now well settled that state courts can be used as the very instruments by which litigants, and the public, may be deprived of 
rights protected by the antitrust laws. When the state courts are so used and the antitrust laws thereby violated, the state 
litigation is as plainly a matter of federal legislative concern as if it had been expressly identified in the debates preceding the 
enactment of the 1890 statute."
896,31," As already noted, supra, at 654-655, n. 23, there was no such express grant of jurisdiction to private litigants in either Clothing 
Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511 or Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281."
896,32," Indeed, Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Porter v. Dicken, 328 U.S. 252, seems to proceed on the assumption that 
the anti-injunction statute is inapplicable when the federal statute may be enforced in either a state or a federal court. "
897,33," Cases in which § 2283 has been held to bar injunctive relief against state proceedings have seldom involved attempts to 
enforce federal statutes.  Indeed, some courts have held that any federal statute expressly authorizing equitable relief is within 
the exception from § 2283."
897,34," It is worthy of note that only 5 of the cited statutes predate the addition of the words ""except as expressly authorized by Act of 
Congress"" to the anti-injunction statute in 1948 (fully 16 were enacted in the last 10 years)."
897,35," The Reviser's Note to § 2283, which is taken from the House Report, H.R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A181-A182 
(1947), states that, with the exception of the addition of the words ""to protect or effectuate its judgments,"" which were intended to 
overrule Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U.S. 118, ""the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood 
and interpreted prior to the Toucey decision."" "
898,36," ""In some situations there could be, of course, a violation of a covenant not to compete without the breach of a fiduciary duty, 
as would be the case if Stoner had not been an officer and director of plaintiff.  In the present case, however, the acts of 
defendants in misappropriating the Lektro-Vend [machine] and their use of it to compete against plaintiff are intertwined, the 
latter being, so to speak, the means by which the former was brought to bear against plaintiff."" Vendo Co. v. Stoner, 58 Ill. 2d 
289, 306-307, 321 N.E. 2d 1, 11 (1974). "
899,37," Indeed, a state court's conclusion that the breach of a covenant not to compete constitutes the violation of a fiduciary 
obligation as a matter of state law is not inconsistent with a federal-court determination that the litigation enforcing that covenant 
was ""conducted in bad faith"" as that concept is used in cases like Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 611. While the District 
Court did not specifically address the question involved in Huffman and Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, it had the following to 
say in addressing the extent of the Sherman Act violation: ""There is persuasive evidence that Vendo's activities in its litigation against the Stoner interests in Illinois state court were not a 
genuine attempt to use the adjudicative process legitimately.  Its theft of trade secret claim was clearly non-meritorious, and 
litigation of this claim might well be interpreted - considering the record as a whole - as an attempt to further harass the Stoner 
interests and limit the amount of aid Stoner could lend Lektro-Vend.  The attempt to enforce the covenants not to compete… 
appears to have been to lengthen the period for which the noncompetition covenants would run.  The purpose of this portion of 
the state litigation seems purely anticompetitive."" 403 F.Supp., at 534-535. The Court of Appeals implicitly affirmed, supra, at 646.  Thus while every state proceeding which clashes with the antitrust laws 
would not necessarily be motivated by a desire to harass or be conducted in bad faith, the findings indicate that such was the 
case here."

926,*," Following this court's decision on the Government's motion to strike the defendants' Parker defense, but prior to the filing of the 
opinion in this action, the Supreme Court shed additional light on the Parker immunity question in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona 
TRADE REGULATION REPORTS NO. 287, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 45 U.S.L.W. 4895 (1977). Bates 
was a multi-faceted challenge to the Arizona Supreme Court's disciplinary rule that prohibited attorneys from advertising in 
newspapers and other media.  The Court held that insofar as plaintiffs sought to predicate their claims on § 1 of the Sherman 
Act, such antitrust claims were barred by Parker immunity, ""since the challenged restraint is the affirmative command of the 
Arizona Supreme Court under its Rules 27(a) and 29(a) and its Disciplinary Rule 2-10(B)."" 45 U.S.L.W. at 4898. Because the 
Arizona Supreme Court was ""the ultimate body wielding the State's power over the practice of law (citations omitted)… the 
restraint is 'compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign', 421 U.S. at 791."" In Bates, the Court distinguished Cantor on three essential grounds.  In the first instance, it observed that ""obviously Cantor 
would have been an entirely different case if the claim had been directed against a public official or public agency, rather than 
against a private party"" since the appellants' claims in Bates were in reality against the State and the Arizona Supreme Court 
and enforcement undertaken by the State Bar was ""completely defined"" by that court. Secondly, the Court recognized that the State had ""no independent regulatory interest"" in the market for light bulbs and there 
was no intimation that the light bulb program ""was justified by flaws in the competitive market or was a response to health or 
safety programs"" or ""essential to the State's regulation of electric utilities."" Id.  Third, the Court noted that the challenged activity 
in Cantor was instigated by the utility with the acquiescence of the state regulatory commission, whereas in Bates the challenged 
""disciplinary rules reflect a clear articulation of the State's policy with regard to professional behavior."" Id.  As a corollary to the 
foregoing comparisons, the court noted its reluctance to approve ""[federal] interference [by means of the application of the 
federal antitrust laws] with a State's traditional regulation of a profession… deeming it significant that the state policy is so clearly 
and affirmatively expressed and that the State's supervision is so active."" Id. It would appear that the opinion in Bates does not require us to depart from our initial denial of the Government's motion to strike 
the State Action defense premised on Parker immunity. In connection with that conclusion certain observations are relevant for 
the future course of the instant proceedings.  In the first instance, all the justices concurred with respect to the Sherman Act 
immunity under Parker v. Brown, nothing that while the claims in Bates were ostensibly directed at the State Bar association, the 
""real party in interest was the State and the Bar association acted merely as the delegated"" agent of the [Arizona Supreme 
Court] under its constant supervision. While the State's participation in and connection with the defendants' rate-making activities is somewhat more tenuous than the 
interrelationship in Bates, we are unable to conclude that certain of the allegedly offensive practices might not be compelled by 
direction of the state acting as sovereign. Similarly, Bates reaffirms the necessity of the State's regulatory interest and the 
Court's disinclination to intervene in areas traditionally subject to state regulation, which would include intrastate commerce.  
Moreover, whether the instant state policies with respect to coherent rate structures are clearly articulated or may be implied and 
whether the state's supervision is ""so active"" requires sensitive factual determinations not capable of adjudication at this stage of 
the proceedings. "
927,5," In Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., supra, 440 F.2d at 1140, the Fifth Circuit explained the applicability of 
Parker immunity in the context of a regulated public utility, stating: ""the Parker exclusion applies to the rates and practices of public utilities enjoying monopoly status under state policy when 
their rates and practices are subjected to meaningful regulation and supervision by the state to the end that they are the 
result of the considered judgment of the state regulatory authority . . ."" (emphasis supplied). In the Gas Light Co. of Columbus decision, the Fifth Circuit held that since the regulatory decision was made after notice and the 
conduct of adversary proceedings, the Parker immunity was available since the administrative action was the ""product"" of the 
state commission.  Id. Although the Fifth Circuit has recently cast some aspersions on the correctness of the underscored 
language in dicta in Litton Systems, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 539 F.2d 418, 422 (5th Cir. 1976), intense 
involvement by the state agency in prescribing the ultimate rate to be charged retains its viability as a consideration and 
standard apropos to the availability of the unfairness doctrine recognized in Cantor, supra, 428 U.S. at 595, 96 S. Ct. at 3119. "
928,6," Alabama -- Under Alabama law, all non-exempted motor carriers are subject ""to control, supervision and regulation by the

""except insofar as the same may be in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the acts of 
congress"" in force in 1940 or thereafter enacted.  Title 48, Ala. Code § 301(4).  The powers and duties of the Alabama public 
service commission are set forth in Title 48, Ala. Code § 301(5), and include, inter alia:"
928,1," .  [The duty] [to] regulate common carriers by motor vehicle as provided in this article and to that end the commission may 
establish reasonable rules and requirements with respect to adequate service, transportation of passengers, baggage, freight 
and express, . . . . . ."
928,4," .  To supervise and regulate common carriers in all matters affecting the relationship between such common carriers and the 
traveling and shipping public. . . ."" Title 48, Ala. Code § 301(17), Alabama statute, further places concomitant duties on the common carriers with respect to rates, 
fares, and charges, including inter alia: "". . .  B. . . . the duty of every common carrier of property by motor vehicle to provide safe and adequate service, equipment 
and facilities for the intrastate transportation of property in the State of Alabama; to establish, observe and enforce just and 
reasonable rates, charges and classifications, and just and reasonable regulations and practices relating thereto . . . [for] all 
. . . matters relating to or connected with the intrastate transportation of property in the State of Alabama. C.  Common carriers of property by motor vehicle may establish reasonable through rates and joint rates, charges and 
classifications with other such carriers or with common carriers by railroad or express or water; . . .  In case of such joint 
rates, fares or charges, it shall be the duty of the carrier parties thereto to establish just and reasonable regulations and 
practices in connection therewith and just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof between carriers participating therein, 
which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of said participating carriers. The foregoing provisions demonstrate -- at least with respect to provision of through routes -- that cooperation between carriers 
in setting joint and nondiscriminatory rates is encouraged or even implicitly approved by the State. Georgia -- Georgia law similarly sanctions cooperation between motor carriers in establishing through routes at prescribed joint 
rates.  To illustrate, the statutory framework requires that the Georgia Public Service Commission ""shall prescribe just and reasonable rates, fares, and charges for transportation by motor common carriers of passengers, 
baggage and property, and for all services rendered by motor common carriers in connection therewith, and the tariffs 
therefor shall be in such form, and shall be filed and published in such manner and on such notice as the Commission may 
prescribe, and shall be subject to change on such notice and in such manner as the commission [sic] may prescribe."" Ga. Code Ann. § 68-613. "
929,," Under Rule 2, General Motor Carrier Rules and Regulations of the Georgia Public Service Commission, Class A carriers are 
defined as: Common carriers of passengers and/or property operating over a fixed route or between fixed termini in intrastate and 
interstate commerce, under Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity. Rule 10(a) of the Rules and Regulations further provides that ""Motor carriers of property operating under certificates Class 'A' will be required to receive property destined to stations 
located on routes of other Class 'A' carriers, and to interchange such property at rates prescribed by this Commission, with 
such connecting carriers."" (emphasis supplied). Again, as a result of the foregoing rules and regulations, defendants note that the establishment of reasonable through rates at 
prescribed joint rates cannot be effectuated without joint and cooperative action by the carriers, and that ongoing administration 
of that requirement by the Georgia Public Service Commission mandates action by the Commission which transcends mere 
general supervisory functions. Mississippi -- Under Mississippi law, any carrier wishing to publish and apply rates different from those prescribed by the 
Mississippi regulatory body must apply to the Commission for authority to make such a change.  Thus, defendants contend that 
the net effect of the pervasive regulatory scheme is to require that all carriers conform to a uniform rate structure, which compels 
cooperation and joint action except in limited circumstances where prior approval of the Commission is required to be secured.  
Moreover, defendants have asserted not wholly without justification that the only manner by which carriers could initiate a 
change in joint-line rates would be by collective application. Tennessee -- Under Tennessee law, the Tennessee Public Service Commission fixes the rates which motor carriers may 
charge.  Although any carrier is permitted to reduce its rates without prior authorization of the Commission, no general increase 
is permitted until hearings have been held and the approval of the Commission secured. Significantly, Rule.40 of Chapter 1220-
2-1 of the Tennessee Public Service Commission, Division of Motor Carriers, adopts Section 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 
49 U.S.C. § 5b, and provides: The rules and regulations governing the agreements between or among two or more carriers relating to rates, fares, 
classifications, division, allowances or charges (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for 
the use of facilities or equipment), or rules and regulations pertaining thereto, or procedures for the joint consideration, 
initiation, or establishment thereof as set forth by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Section 5a of the Interstate 
Commerce Act, are hereby adopted by the Tennessee Public Service Commission; providing, however, that the final 
determination on any rates, fares, classifications, divisions, allowances, charges, rules and regulations or procedures shall 
be left in its final determination to the Tennessee Public Service Commission. (emphasis supplied). The Government concedes that the foregoing rule might be construed as authorizing collective rate-making pursuant to the 
procedures employed by the ICC under § 5a; however, it contends that the ""state action"" test could still not be satisfied since the 
""enabling statute of the Tennessee Commission does not authorize such a rule."" The Government's argument in this respect, 
however, fails to recognize that the most recent decision in this circuit, City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., supra, 
holds that legislative intent and mandate of anticompetitive activities need not be expressed in such enabling legislation, if the 
intent can be inferred from the regulatory scheme as a whole.  Since the Tennessee Public Service Commission has the function 
of primary arbiter of the legislative intent in enacting and enforcing the regulatory provisions governing intrastate motor carrier 
transportation within Tennessee, the Public Service Commission's interpretation and enactment of the foregoing rule has great 
persuasive import in the absence of express legislation on the subject of collective action by motor carriers and antitrust 
immunity. "
930,7," House Bill 417 of the North Carolina Legislature, entitled ""An Act to provide for Uniform and Joint Rates Among Motor Carriers 
of the Same Class"" contains provisions similar to those in the federal Motor Carrier Act. The Bill, which was enacted by the state 
legislature, allows two or more carriers to enter into an agreement relating to ""rates, fares, classifications, divisions, allowances 
or charges"" ""[for] the purpose of achieving a stable rate structure."" Subsection (b) further provides that it ""shall be the policy of 
[the State of North Carolina] to fix uniform rates for the same or similar services by carriers of the same class."" Similarly, like § 
5a of the Motor Carrier Act, the parties to the agreement may apply to the state public service commission for approval of the 
agreement.  Moreover, pursuant to § (h), the parties to any agreement so approved are relieved from the operation of the state 
antitrust laws with respect to the making of the agreement and in carrying out the agreement according to the terms and 
conditions thereof and those imposed by the state public service commission.  The North Carolina provisions are virtually 
identical to the parallel provisions of the Motor Carrier Act and, indeed, constitute demonstrable and persuasive evidence that 
motor carriers, at least within the State of North Carolina, may be subject to conflicting standards imposed by the state 
regulatory commission and the broader standard of competition imposed by the federal antitrust laws. Our observations in this 
respect, of course, do not constitute recognition of any absolute principle that the state could expressly immunize a carrier's 
activities from the federal antitrust laws, since such a holding would be contrary to the Supremacy and Commerce clauses of the 
Constitution.  See Marnell, supra. See also, Cantor, supra, 96 S. Ct. at 3120. "
931,8," Cf.  Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., 1975-2 TRADE CASES P 60,439 (Conn. Sup. Ct. 1975) discussed infra 
at note 9."
931,9," The Attorney General for the State of North Dakota has recently expressed his opinion that the constitutional prohibitions on 
combinations and monopolies for the purpose or having the effect of controlling the price of transportation under North Dakota 
law was not applicable to the rate-making function of a rate-bureau such as defendants herein.  Opinion of the Attorney General 
of North Dakota. 1976-1 TRADE CASES P 60,856 at 68,755 (1976). The Attorney General relied on several factors in reaching 
that conclusion.  In the first instance, he observed that the comprehensive state regulation carried on by the state through its 
Public Service Commission and that the ultimate control over tariffs, rates, charges, rules and regulations and practices of the 
carrier rested ultimately with the state.  He further found it significant that the Public Service Commission had, like North Carolina 
herein, exempted a rate bureau from the proscriptions of the state antitrust laws. In analogizing the state provisions with those 
contained in § 5a of the Motor Carriers Act, he concluded that: ""When actions of common carriers are subject to complete and minute regulation in the public interest by the ICC and PSC 
there is no need to apply antitrust laws to reinforce competition . . . since public regulation such as we have here is 
generally considered to be a substitute for free market forces and anti-trust legislation which has in the past proven its 
inability to preserve competition."" Id. at 68,755. The Attorney General further relied upon a recent order and report of the ICC in Ex Parte No. 297, Rate Bureau Investigation, 
decided June 3, 1975, in which the ICC concluded that review of operations which was also participated in by the Anti-Trust 
Division of the United States Department of Justice, of rate bureaus had not disclosed any significant abuses of the procedures 
utilized by such bureaus; therefore, the report concluded that the antitrust immunity conferred by § 5a should be continued.  
Secondly, the Attorney General found it significant that each carrier member of a rate bureau retained its full right of independent 
action, and that joint rate-making done by such rate conferences was ""necessary to ensure the uniform and non-discriminatory 
rates mandated by the legislature."" Accordingly, the Attorney General concluded that a ""rate bureau's publication of tariffs 
governing the charges for intrastate transportation of property within North Dakota is infused with sufficient state action to 
exempt it from the proscriptions of"" North Dakota's antitrust laws. Significantly, the Attorney General also noted that a rate 
bureau's publication of tariffs governing transportation of property could be distinguished from factual situations involving the tie-
in of a service, such as the sale of electrical bulbs, which was not immunized from antitrust attack under the federal antitrust 
laws, see Cantor, supra, or tie-ins of non-necessary devices for telephone answering devices, which were not immunized from 
attack under Connecticut's antitrust laws. Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., 1975-2 TRADE CASES P 60,439 
(Conn. Sup. Ct. 1975). But see South-West Utilities, Inc. v. South Central Bell Telephone, 1977-1 TRADE CASES P 61,303 (La. 
Ct. Apps. 1976) (Louisiana Public Service Commission has no authority nor could it be implied from power to regulate 
""reasonableness"" of rates to shield a regulated industry from antitrust scrutiny under state law since rates and services which 
are ""reasonable and just"" may be part of an overall conspiracy to restrain trade.) "
935,10," The Government has rather effectively argued that it has no standing to challenge the anticompetitive effects of the rate-
making procedures nor are there any administrative procedures available to it under the laws of the individual states, with the 
result that doctrines of primary jurisdiction or exhaustion of remedies are wholly inapposite.  We are compelled to observe that 
defendant SMCRC has not specifically pointed out any express remedies that the Government might have.  Likewise, insofar as 
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is concerned, we find the instant facts barely distinguishable from Litton Systems, Inc., supra, 
where this circuit observed in an analogous context: ""None of Bell's other arguments in favor of the district court's [prior reference in] this case are persuasive.  First, Bell 
asserts that the state tribunals should have the opportunity to determine the 'validity' of Bell's tariffs. This determination has 
already been made, however; the tariffs were assented to by the State and local tribunals as 'just and reasonable' within the 
meaning of State and local law."""
935,539," F.2d at 424 n. 16. To the extent that defendants might seek prior resort for a determination as to the ""validity"" of the subject tariffs and rates, we 
would be compelled to agree with the Government, that the defendants' rates have either been approved or acquiesced in by the 
respective state public service commissions on the basis of the Litton Systems, Inc. decision. On the other hand, insofar as defendant SMCRC seeks resort to the state tribunals on the question of whether such collective 
ratemaking activities were a ""regulatory necessity"", other language in Litton Systems, Inc. suggests that prior resort to the 
respective agencies might not be wholly futile. Thus, in contrast to the facts herein, the Fifth Circuit in Litton Systems, Inc. concluded that the district court could have, as in 
Cantor, adequately determined the immunity question without prior reference to state agencies, noting: ""The manner in which Bell tariffs were acquiesced in by the state agencies strongly suggests that the tying of PBX 
equipment to general telephone service was not considered necessary to effective regulation of telephone service.  No 
state statute, case, regulation, or ruling has been cited as suggesting even remotely that the acquiescence in the asserted 
tying arrangements is the product of any coherent state policy.  Bell's effort to seek prior recourse at this stage is not 
designed to clarify the purpose of such policy nor the need for arrangements to effectuate that policy . . .  It is arguable that 
Bell desires to establish a regulatory necessity for its practices after itself inventing and establishing those very practices."""
935,539, F.2d at 424. 
936,," The Government has aptly noted that in some instances passive acquiescence by the state commissions has resulted in the 
defendants' establishment of the practices and rates with respect to which they seek to establish a ""regulatory necessity."" 
However, defendants have cited numerous state statutes, regulations, and rules to support their contention that the rates as well 
as the means to fix such rates are the product or result of coherent state policy.  Even assuming that Cantor and Bates v. State 
Bar of Arizona, TRADE REGULATION REPORTS NO. 287, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 45 U.S.L.W. 4895 
(1977) collectively stand for the proposition that Parker immunity is available only to the state or state agencies, we are not 
inclined to summarily hold that prior resort may not be desirable on the unfairness question.  Such a determination could be 
more appropriately made following discovery, through a motion filed by defendants seeking a stay of this action pending prior 
reference after the factual background could be developed. "
941,1," Appellants conceded at oral argument that no finding of fact by the trial judge had been assigned as error and that all issues 
were purely legal.  We, therefore, do not review the trial court's findings of fact. "
942,2," Similarly, in Target Stores, Inc. v. Twin Plaza Co., 277 Minn 481, 153 NW2d 832 (1967), it was held that, ""The fact that a 
document covers a building yet to be constructed implies that the transaction is at most an agreement to lease rather than a 
lease * * *."" 153 NW2d at 840. On the other hand, contracts to lease in future upon completion of a building have been held to 
be present leases. See In re Wonderfair Stores, Inc. of Arizona, 511 F2d 1206 (9th Cir 1975)."
942,3," The lease provides that: ""1.  Lessee shall pay or cause to be paid to Lessor as rental for the leased premises the following amounts: ""(a) 10 per cent of the gross income realized from the operation of the leased facilities up to and including the first $ 
100,000 of such receipts for each year of the lease term * * *, and "
943,," ""(b) One-third of the gross income realized from the operation of the leased facilities in excess of the aforesaid $ 100,000 of 
such receipts for each year of the lease term * * *, and ""(c) Commencing on February 7, 1972, and on each 7th day of February thereafter to and including February 7, 1986, the 
additional sum of $ 5,000."""
943,4," In Marastoni v. Lucey, 268 Or 433, 440, 521 P2d 521 (1974), it was held: ""There are three essential elements of a lease: a 
description of the property, the duration of the term, and the rental consideration."" Accord, Karamanos v. Hamm, 267 Or 1, 4, 
513 P2d 761 (1973); Bevan v. Templeman, 145 Or 279, 289, 26 P2d 775 (1933)."
943,5," The evidence discloses that in Lincoln County Yaquina owned only the waterfront property in Newport and a small upriver 
parcel which was not suited for deep water facilities."

transferee of the reversion who is a purchaser for value still takes subject to the lease if he has actual or constructive notice of 
it."""
943,7," Northwest admitted during the trial that at the time it purchased the property from Sunset, it was aware of the lease provisions.  
The trial court also found in its findings of fact that: ""Defendant Northwest knew of paragraph 6 in the lease between Newport 
and Yaquina prior to receiving a deed and completing the purchase of property from Sunset in March, 1974."" "
945,8," See n.4, supra."
945,9," Under 28 USC § 1337, Federal district courts are granted original jurisdiction of any civil proceeding ""arising under any Act of 
Congress * * * protecting trade or commerce against restraints and monopolies."" See also 15 USC § 15, allowing private suits in 
Federal district courts for antitrust violations.  However, it has been recognized that a defendant can raise in state court a 
Federal antitrust defense to a breach of contract action.  Butler Enterprises v. Vanlandingham, 264 Or 414, 424, 505 P2d 1149 
(1973). See also 1A Moore's Federal Practice 2325, para. 0.208[4] (1974) and Note, ""Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Federal 
Courts in Private Civil Actions,"" 70 Harv L Rev 509 (1957), and cases cited therein. "
946,10," There has been no showing that the operation of the lease provision would allow Newport to set monopolistic fees for the use 
of its docks. By the terms of the lease, the lessee is to ""maintain in effect tariffs which are comparable to and competitive with 
such tariffs from time to time in effect in other parts of the southwestern coast of Oregon."" Moreover, the amount of tariffs appear 
to be regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission.  Newport has received approval of a tariff for petroleum products including 
natural gas. It appears, then, that the restraint at issue is limiting the entry of competitors to Newport in the operation of docks and 
warehouses for deep water ships. "
947,11," In the same case it was noted, ""Whether or not the restriction as to time and territorial extent is reasonable must be judged 
from the standpoint of the time and place when and where the contract is executed, and from the general nature of the business 
involved."" (195 Or at 408.) Similarly, Restatement of Contracts 2d (Tent. Draft May 12, 1977) § 328 at 104, comment a, 
concludes that: ""Whether a restraint is reasonable is determined in light of the circumstances of the transaction, including not 
only the particular facts but general social and economic conditions as well.  The promise is viewed in terms of the effects that it 
could have had and not merely what actually occurred.  Account is taken of such factors as the protection that it affords for the 
promisee's legitimate interests, the hardship that it imposes on the promisor, and the likely injury to the public."""
947,12," Cf. Restatement of Property 2d (Landlord and Tenant) § 7.2, comment b at 254 (1977): ""The mere presence in a lease of a 
noncompetition promise by the landlord justifies the conclusion that it is essential that the promise be observed if the tenant is to 
conduct his business on the leased property profitably."" "
948,13," For a review of the cases discussing the validity of covenants not to compete contained in leases under a common-law 
analysis, see Restatement of Property 2d (Landlord and Tenant) 256-257, Reporter's Note to § 7.2 (1977) and Annotation, 97 
ALR2d 4 (1964). "
949,14," See n.10, supra, regarding lack of effect on prices or tariffs to shippers using the docks."
949,15," The policy basis of the Sherman Act is to protect competition by rendering illegal those business arrangements which unfairly 
assist one competitor to the detriment of other competitors. It is aimed at ""preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule 
of trade."" Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958)."
949,16," That section provides that ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to 
lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods * * *, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such 
price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, * * * 
of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, 
agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.""

950,17," Courts should be wary (particularly in antitrust cases) of granting the declaratory relief sought by a party whose record is 
incomplete and speculative.  Cf., White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 261 (1963). See also Oregon Medical Assn. v. 
Rawls, 276 Or 1101, 1108-1110, 557 P2d 664 (1976). "
951,18," Northwest additionally failed to show the relevant market in which Newport attempted a monopoly. There appears to be some 
dispute about whether proof of the relevant market is necessary to establish an attempt to monopolize. See American Bar Asso., 
Antitrust Law Developments 60-63 (1975).  Compare, United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 395 n. 23 
(1956) with Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177-178 (1965). One writer has 
commented, ""For a time, it was uncertain whether attempt, combination, or conspiracy offenses under the Sherman Act required 
definition of the relevant market. The trend, however, has been toward a recognition that the anti-competitive effects of such 
offenses can only be ascertained by reference to an accurately defined market."" Note, ""Telek v. IBM: Defining the Relevant

withdrawn.  A further claim that the entries on defendants' books and records were sufficient to constitute separate charges for 
exchange access and intercommunication, see pp. 1110-1111 infra, and that plaintiffs were therefore not required to pay the 
entire amount of the tax which was collected from them, was dismissed by the Court before trial, along with a third-party

981,52," At trial the plaintiffs offered into evidence three documents which appear to be notes taken of the meetings of May 17 and 18, 
1961, and similar documents relating to the meetings of October 1965, see p. 1119 infra.  The defendants objected that these 
documents were inadmissible hearsay.  However, the parties stipulated in the pretrial order that each such document was 
""prepared or caused to be prepared"" by an employee of one of the operating companies who attended the meetings, and that 
each was ""directed to or concerned with matters within the scope of employment"" of the person who prepared the document.  
Thus, as to the operating company which employed the person preparing it, each document is admissible within the terms of 
Rule 801(d)(2)(D), Fed.R.Evid. Cf.  United States v. Miller, 246 F.2d 486, 490 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 905, 78 S. Ct. 
332, 2 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1957); United States v. S.B. Penick & Co., 136 F.2d 413, 416 (2d Cir. 1943). Moreover, at the close of the 
plaintiffs' case the Court ruled that the independent nonhearsay evidence adduced by plaintiffs was sufficient, under United 
States v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 1116, 1120 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied sub nom., Lynch v. United States, 397 U.S. 1028, 90 S. Ct. 
1276, 25 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1970), to allow consideration of the hearsay evidence as to all alleged conspirators. However, the fact that these documents are admissible does not mean that they are entitled to any substantial weight.  As the 
Court stated at the time the exhibits were received, it is apparent upon their face that the documents embody ""a man's 
impressions, what he recorded at the time, expressing his own opinion or what he believed he heard."" In many cases the notes 
are fragmentary and unclear in meaning.  Moreover some of the persons who prepared the documents are unidentified. "
982,53," ""Direct in-dialing"" and ""[station] identification"" are, respectively, DID and IOD.  ""Intercept"" refers to a service in which calls 
dialed to unassigned numbers may be routed to an attendant or to a recorded announcement.  ""Night connections"" allow calls 
coming in to the attendant position to be answered even after the attendant has left.  ""Transfer"" is self-explanatory."
982,54," The defendants wanted Centrex to become a standard offering because it promised to offer significant savings over PBX 
service.  Operator time would be reduced because the capability for DID and IOD meant that there would be more calls dialed 
directly, more station-to-station calls, and fewer ""time and charges"" calls.  Moreover, each call was likely to require less circuit 
time since it could be dialed directly to the extension rather than through a switchboard."
982,55, See pp. 1108-1109 supra.
982,56," Except for an additional charge, in the case of Centrex-CO, resulting from the fact that the switching equipment was located 
on telephone company premises.  See p. 1109 supra. "
983,57, See n. 14 supra.
983,58," The record reveals that five subscribers -- American Oil Co., Monsanto Co. (a named plaintiff herein), Union Carbide Corp., 
Mobil Oil Corp. and Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. -- made inquiries to their respective operating companies between 1965 
and 1970.  In at least three cases the operating companies consulted with AT&T before answering that no separation would be 
made.  In addition, the issue was discussed several times within AT&T."
983,59, Kemp had also been involved with Centrex rate matters in 1961 and had helped prepare the April 1961 Centrex materials. 
984,60," The revised tariff filed by New York Telephone Co. in New York State decreased its Centrex station charges by a negligible 
amount, totalling an estimated $1,100 the first year.  The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of West Virginia sought a 
general rate increase simultaneously with its revised Centrex tariff. The revised tariffs filed by the other operating companies did 
not result in any change in their total Centrex station charges."
984,61," Plaintiffs contend that the filing of new tariffs was not necessary in order to establish separate charges sufficient to meet the 
statutory requirement.  In support of this claim they rely primarily upon the fact that language referring to tariffs was dropped 
from a draft of proposed excise tax legislation presented by AT&T lobbyists to the staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on 
Internal Revenue Taxation when the bill was submitted to the committee.  However, this evidence is not relevant to the 
construction of the Act.  HN14[
] The purpose of examining legislative history is to attempt to ascertain Congressional intent on 
ambiguous issues.  See, e.g., Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 618, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976) 
(Stewart, J., dissenting); United States v. Wise, 370 U.S. 405, 414, 82 S. Ct. 1354, 8 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1962); Marriott In-Flite 
Servs. v. Local 504, Air Transport Div., Transport Workers of America, 557 F.2d 295 at 298-299 (2d Cir. 1977); United States v. 
Thompson, 319 F.2d 665, 668 (2d Cir. 1963). Consideration of unofficial materials which were never, so far as the record shows, 
brought to the attention of a single Congressman cannot possibly shed light upon the intent of Congress.  The meaning of 
""separate charge"" as used in the Act must be found in the Act itself and its legislative history. There is nothing in these sources to indicate that a ""separate charge"" was intended to mean anything other than a tariff charge, 
which would be the ordinary construction of a statute dealing with regulated public utilities, whose charges are required by law to 
be embodied in their tariffs. See p. 1106 supra.  Reference to the regulation of telephone companies was in fact made on the 
Senate floor during discussion of the Act. 111 Cong.Rec. 13624-25, 14073 (1965) (remarks of Sen. Long). In any event, the history cited by plaintiffs does not support their position.  First, the reference to tariffs in the AT&T draft was 
made in attempting to distinguish local exchange service from toll telephone service and not in defining ""private communication 
service."" Moreover there is no explanation of why the language referring to tariffs was dropped; plaintiffs' theory that the 
committee staff intended to allow a separation of charges to be made without filing tariffs is pure conjecture.  Cf.  Trailmobile Co. 
v. Whirls, 331 U.S. 40, 61, 67 S. Ct. 982, 91 L. Ed. 1328 (1947); Gemsco, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 244, 260, 65 S. Ct. 605, 89 L. 
Ed. 921 (1945). In short, there is no indication that Congress intended to apply the ""separate charge"" provision to anything other 
than a tariff. Plaintiffs also rely onRev.Rul. 69-152, 1969-1 C.B. 289, which held that a sufficient ""separate charge"" existed when telephone 
company records identified separately the monthly charges for equipment and service even if the customer's bills did not.  
However, nothing in this ruling indicates whether or not the tariffs of the operating company in question had separate charges, 
nor does the ruling refer specifically to Centrex as opposed to PBX.  In fact, in an unpublished technical advice memorandum 
communicated to defendants, the Internal Revenue Service adopted the position that the provisions of an operating company's 
tariff are controlling.  In sum, Kemp, Weber, and other persons involved in considering the question of establishing separate "
985,," charges, who received consistent advice from AT&T's tax attorneys that a tariff revision would be necessary, were fully justified 
in relying on that advice."
985,62," The Tax Adjustment Act of 1966, Pub L. No. 89-368, § 202, 80 Stat. 38, which became effective only two and one-half months

which time the tax was to be reduced to 1% as provided in the Act.  The Congressional reports stated that the tax reduction was

Later that year the 10% rate was extended for another year and a half, until January 1, 1970, and subsequent annual reductions 
to 5%, 3% and 1% were enacted, with total repeal planned for 1973.  Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, P.L. 90-
364, § 105(b), 82 Stat. 251.  Similarly, the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which became effective two days before the scheduled 
reduction of the tax in 1970, postponed each annual reduction of the tax another year, with final elimination set for January 1, 
1974.  P.L. 91-172, § 702(b), 83 Stat. 487.  Both in 1968 and 1969 Congress indicated that the extension of the tax was a 
temporary budgetary measure.  H.R.Rep.No. 1104, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1968), reprinted in [1968] U.S.Code Cong. &

986,65," The prospect of competition also raised concern that, because Centrex-CO and Centrex-CU were made a single offering, a 
competitor might claim that one service unfairly subsidized the other, even if this were not the case.  This consideration 
suggested that Centrex-CO and Centrex-CU should be separated from each other, but did not directly affect the decision 
whether or not to establish separate charges for exchange access and intercommunication."

986,68," In 1962 the Department of Defense filed a protest to the Centrex tariffs filed by Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 
Tennessee; the Tennessee Public Service Commission dismissed the protest on April 17, 1963, which order was affirmed by the 
Tennessee Chancery Court in 1964.  An appeal was dismissed by stipulation.  Also in 1962 the Department of Defense filed a 
protest with respect to Southern Bell's Centrex tariffs in Louisiana, but the protest was never prosecuted.  In 1963 the General "

Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939). In each of those cases competitors 
entered into separate agreements with a third party.  The Supreme Court found the evidence sufficient to establish that, despite 
the fact that each defendant made its agreement independently, each was aware that common action was being taken, and a 
conspiracy was thus found.  In this case, the evidence does not establish that there was any agreement between any of the 
operating companies and AT&T."

Centrex tariffs were not filed by six companies in six states until 1965 or later."
989,73," Three companies in three states did not offer the intercept service; four companies in eight states did not offer night 
connections.  Each of these was part of the basic Centrex package described in AT&T's April 1961 material, see pp. 1116-1117 
supra.  Moreover, over half of the companies did not offer station hunting, a supplemental service recommended by AT&T."

990,78," Plaintiffs contend that the conspiracy can be viewed as a vertical one between AT&T and its subsidiaries because of the

L. Ed. 136 (1899), the illegality is based on the fact that, but for the agreement, there would likely have been actual competition 
among the defendants.  Here there would never have been such competition.  United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 
526, 93 S. Ct. 1096, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1973), was decided under § 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18, which was 
""intended to reach incipient monopolies and trade restraints outside the scope of the Sherman Act."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United

994,95," In light of this decision it is unnecessary to consider several claims advanced by defendants with respect to the antitrust 
charges.  Defendants contend that, even if their actions violated the antitrust laws, plaintiffs cannot recover treble damages 
because the defendants' Centrex rates were embodied in tariffs filed with public utility regulatory commissions.  See Georgia v. 
Pennsylvania R.R., 324 U.S. 439, 453, 65 S. Ct. 716, 89 L. Ed. 1051 (1945); Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., 260 U.S. 156, 43 S. 
Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183 (1922). Each of these cases involved tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal 
agency, and thus involved the proper harmonization of two federal statutes, whereas the case at bar involves allegedly 
conflicting federal and state law.  See generally Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 
(1976). Significantly different considerations may be applicable in each case.  See Litton Systems, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. 
Co., 539 F.2d 418, 420-24 (5th Cir. 1976); Handler, Twenty-Fourth Annual Antitrust Review, 72 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 14 (1972). Defendants also contend that the plaintiffs were not injured in their business or property as required by § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15, and that they have not shown the requisite effect upon interstate commerce."
994,96," I.R.C. §§ 4251, 4291, 7501; see generally DuPont Glore Forgan Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 428 F. Supp. 1297 
(S.D.N.Y.1977). "

telephone companies ""to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, 
facilities, or services for or in connection with [interstate or foreign] communication service."""
995,98," While the plaintiffs analogize the defendants' role to that of a corporate fiduciary, cf.  Oil & Gas Ventures -- First 1958 Fund, 
Ltd. v. Kung, 250 F. Supp. 744, 749 (S.D.N.Y.1966), they expressly disclaimed any contention that the defendants actually had 
any such common law duty, and base their claim entirely upon the Act.  Cf.  Board of Public Util. Comm'rs v. New York Tel. Co.,

995,99," Defendants contend that even if the Act did impose such a duty upon them, the Court should not entertain a private right of 
action for violation of that duty because Congress did not explicitly create such a cause of action and the area of public utility 
regulation is traditionally left to state law.  See Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462, 97 S. Ct. 1292, 1301-04, 51 L. Ed.

proposed by Senator Nelson, which would have required the Council of Economic Advisers to report annually to Congress on 
the economic effects of the excise tax reductions, and in particular whether the benefits were being passed through to 
consumers.  Senator Nelson stated that his amendment, which was passed by the Senate but dropped in conference on the 
ground that the Council already intended to make such a study, see 111 Cong.Rec. 14072-73 (1965), was offered because the 
Act did not prevent any person from retaining for himself the benefits of the tax, and to ensure that Congress found out if that 
occurred.  Senator Long, supporting the amendment, referred specifically to the telephone tax repeal, and the possibility that the 
benefits of that repeal would not be passed on to consumers, thus indicating a belief that even to the extent it was intended to 
benefit consumers the Act did not impose any duty on telephone companies. 111 Cong.Rec. 13624-25 (1965)."

1000,1," Plaintiff instituted this action against all parties having even a remote connection to the cause of action.  Not only were the 
Monmouth County Board of Realtors and the Monmouth County Multiple Listing Service, a committee of the county board, made 
parties defendant, but Charles Darrah, president of the county board, William G. Kircher, executive officer of the county board, 
the New Jersey Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors were joined.  As complete relief can be afforded 
in regard to the rather abstract issue presented by considering the roles of the first two defendants, simplicity suggests that 
consideration of the ancillary defendants be limited. "
1001,2," The court pauses to note that it disagrees with the defendants' argument that application of the per se rule is foreclosed by 
statute.  HN1[
] N.J.S.A. 56:9-5(a) provides: This act shall not forbid the existence of trade and professional organizations created for the purpose of mutual help, and 
not having capital stock, nor forbid or restrain members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate "
1002,," objects thereof not otherwise in violation of this act; nor shall those organizations or members per se be illegal 
combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the provisions of this act.  A close reading of this section demonstrates that the organization as an entity must be viewed separately from its conduct.  
Thus, the act exempts the organization itself while mandating that the activities of its members may not be undertaken in 
violation of law.  Furthermore, a per se approach may not be applied to the organization, although the doctrine may be applied to 
the activities of the organization where appropriate.  See Oates v. Eastern Bergen Cty. Multiple Listing Service, Inc., supra, 113 
N.J. Super. at 394. To construe the statute otherwise would require detailed judicial analysis of conduct which clearly invokes 
the per se rule, such as price fixing, a result not envisioned by the Legislature. "

1006,," (2) Whether the State of Oklahoma split its cause of action against APCO when it could have asserted any alleged violation 
of state antitrust law as a claim pendent to the jurisdiction of the federal court. (3) Whether state antitrust regulation of the conduct alleged in the Petition is preempted by federal antitrust regulation. (4) Whether the State of Oklahoma may maintain this action against this defendant where the Attorney General initiated this 
action without proper authority pursuant to 74 O.S. § 18b. (5) Whether the State, in addition to the other remedies available only to it, also has a civil action for money damages as a 
""person"" within the meaning of 79 O.S. § 25."

Sherman Antitrust Act which is virtually identical to the Section we are today interpreting.  The Supreme Court employed a like 
rationale in ruling ""person"" as used in the Federal Act does not include the United States.  In so holding, the Court stated: ""1. HN3[
] Without going beyond the words of the section, the use of the phrase 'any person' is insufficient to authorize an 
action by the Government.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that if the purpose was to include the United States, 
""the ordinary dignities of speech would have led"" to its mention by name.  It is supported also by the collocation of the 
phrase in the section.  The provision is that 'any person' injured by violation of the Act, 'by any other person or corporation' 
may maintain an action for treble damages against the latter.  It is hardly credible that Congress used the term ""person"" in 
different senses in the same sentence. Yet, unless it did, the United States would not only be entitled to sue but would be 
liable to suit for treble damages. The more natural inference, we think, is that the meaning of the word was in both uses 
limited to what are usually known as natural and artificial persons, that is, individuals and corporations."""

1044,3," Paragraph 6 of the 1954 agreement prohibiting ARCT from delivering its machines to firms other than the licensees of the 
""HELANCA"" process was included by Chavanoz to carry out its contractual commitment to a Swiss company, Heberlein, reading 
as follows: "
1045,," ""Chavanoz undertakes for ARCT to deliver its machines only to firms which sign the licenses mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 
with Heberlein, regardless of the fact of whether the Chavanoz patents constituting the subject of the present contract exist 
or do not exist in the countries concerned."" Under a 1958 modification to the 1954 agreement ARCT-France was relieved from the provisions of paragraph 6 as to certain 
countries, not including the United States, and under certain conditions. "
1047,4," As stated by Judge Widener in Duplan Corporation v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 540 F.2d 1215, 1218, Footnote 3 (4th Cir. 1976), 
""The American legal system apparently has no direct equivalent to the French conseil en brevets.  For our purposes, however, it 
is sufficient to note that Soep was not a lawyer, but, at all times relevant here, represented Chavanoz in patent matters."" "
1051,5," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . ."" Section 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 2) makes liable: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . ."" "
1052,6," In 1954 Chavanoz owned no United States patents, and we need not ponder the question of whether the sale of a machine by 
ARCT-France in this country prior to the 1957 Chavanoz-DMRC agreement to a purchaser not licensed under the HELANCA 
process would have carried with it an implied right to use the machine, for in fact no such sales were made. "
1053,7," Referring to the right to reserve control over a product as to which a manufacturer has parted dominion or transferred risk of 
loss to another, the court in Schwinn said in Footnote 6: ""We have no occasion here to consider whether a patentee has any 
greater rights in this respect."" 388 U.S. at p. 379. The parties in this case, as have the courts and scholars in cases and 
commentaries following Schwinn, have debated the meaning of this rather ambiguous statement.  See an interesting discussion 
of this subject in Vertical Restraints on Patented Products and Schwinn: The Case For a Rule of Reason Approach, 43 George 
Washington Law Review 239, 251-252 (November, 1974). "
1055,8," The exact meaning of ""technical information"" as used here remains something of a mystery.  In a letter to a Throwster's 
attorney dated April 22, 1961, Armitage of DMRC wrote: ""The machine itself contains structural and functional elements, some of which are the subject of patents and patent 
applications and some of which are included in the technical information which is made available to the purchaser of the 
machine, and this also applies to the process under which the licensee is licensed.  As far as the machine is concerned, "
1056,," ARCT, the licensed manufacturer, is not permitted to make available such embodiments of the technical information except 
to licensees for their use."" But there was never any doubt that in order to get the machines a purchaser had to sign a license. In the same letter Armitage 
continued: ""In order to get the machine in the first place from the foreign licensed manufacturer, the purchaser agrees to pay this 
continuing royalty under the license for its use."" (PX 215). "
1058,9," In February, 1959, Chavanoz sued Leesona in France, claiming that the sale and use of the Superloft machines in that country 
infringed three Chavanoz patents which were the counterparts of its United States Patents Nos.  2,741,893, 2,761,272 and 
2,780,047.  This suit was included in the litigation settled in this country in 1964."
1058,10," Denier is a unit of weight for yarns of all materials, natural and synthetic, equal to.05 gram per 450 meters.  From 1957 and 
continuing into the late 1960's 70 denier nylon yarn constituted a major portion of the yarn being processed on false twist 
machines."
1058,11," The initial DMRC royalty of 2 1/2% of the manufacturer's published list price for raw yarn worked out to approximately 4 1/2 
cents per pound for 70 denier nylon based on the then prevailing list price of $1.71 per pound.  This list price remained in effect 
for ten years or more thereafter. "
1059,12," In the same year the present litigation was instituted, 1969, Leesona became the defendant in numerous actions brought by 
purchasers of its false twist machinery challenging the validity of the Leesona patents and asserting antitrust claims.  Several of 
the plaintiffs in the present litigation were parties plaintiff to those actions which were finally consolidated in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida and assigned to the Honorable Clyde Atkins, United States District Judge.  In an 
order of July 11, 1974, Judge Atkins granted summary judgment holding the manufacturing license agreements mentioned 
herein which Leesona had signed with the various machinery manufacturers to be in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Act.  This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on November 5, 1976.  In 
Re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, 541 F.2d 1127, rehearing and rehearing en banc denied, February 3, 1977, cert. 
denied, 433 U.S. 910, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1094, 97 S. Ct. 2976 (1977). Although as previously noted this case is not regarded as 
controlling on the price-fixing aspect of the alleged vertical conspiracy, it is considered, as will be seen, to be highly germane to 
the alleged horizontal conspiracy. "
1061,13," As a matter of fact there were findings in this Canadian case which would have been favorable to DMRC's efforts to invalidate 
the Leesona patents under Section 102 of the United States patent law, 35 U.S.C. § 102. In the Canadian case it was to 
Leesona's interest that it establish the earliest invention date possible for the Canadian counterparts of its United States patents 
Nos. 105, 108 and 109, and it alleged that the inventions embodied in those patents were in fact made in July, 1947, a position 
which the Canadian court in effect adopted.  In the Florida litigation, In Re Yarn Processing, supra, Judge Atkins held Leesona 
collaterally estopped to assert to the contrary, and he invalidated the United States patents on summary judgment in a decision 
reported in 360 F. Supp. 74 (1973), which was later reversed in another appeal, In Re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, 
498 F.2d 271 (5th Cir. 1974). "
1063,14," As noted in Footnote 13, Judge Atkins held the Leesona patents invalid on summary judgment, but on appeal the Fifth Circuit 
held there were issues of fact requiring a trial.  In Re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, 498 F.2d 271 (1974). The court 
understands that thereafter there were various settlements and that no trial to test the validity of the Leesona patents was held. "

case by the Honorable Simon H. Rifkind, of counsel here, see American Patent Law Association Bulletin, October-November, 
1972, p. 696 at p. 699 et seq. "
1066,16," Unquestionably the escrow arrangement which contained this royalty increase had as one of its purposes the offer of security 
to new purchasers of ARCT equipment against the possibility of having to pay royalties to Leesona as well as DMRC in the 
event Leesona won the suit, but to assume that it escaped the notice of Armitage that raising DMRC's royalty rate from 2 1/2% 
to 3 1/2% of the manufacturer's list price brought DMRC's royalty rates into virtual parity with Leesona's for all practical purposes "
1067,," would be to ascribe to him a naivete totally foreign to his character.  Actually, an escrow fund was never established, but after 
the settlement the increased royalty rate remained in effect."
1067,17," The decision of the Canadian trial court upholding these patents would not be controlling in the United States.  Ditto, Inc. v. 
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company, 336 F.2d 67, 70 (8th Cir. 1964)."
1067,18," It is interesting that under one of the settlement agreements between DMRC and Leesona alone DMRC for no additional 
consideration was granted a license under Leesona's patents insofar as they might be applicable to DMRC's Agilon (edge-
crimping) process (PX 223, Tab B). "

Milliken was a man who liked operations which were in the black."" Defendants' Closing Argument, Tr. 88, p. 16,877."
1068,20," In its answer to plaintiffs' interrogatory DMRC listed its royalty income from the beginning of the program through 1973 as 
follows (PX 1062):"
1068,1959,"  $ 1,000.00"

1071,21," Plaintiffs also advance the argument that DMI by its own actions ""facilitated the combination among defendants and their 
combination with Leesona"" and should therefore be liable for its own participation in the settlement. The conclusion that DMRC's 
actions are imputable to DMI under traditional agency principles makes it unnecessary to consider this somewhat novel theory of 
liability. "
1072,22," Waters was in charge of the false twist machinery sales for Whitin but was not a part of management, and although he 
attended two meetings at which unproductive settlement negotiation discussions occurred, there is no evidence that he had any 
part in the final negotiations which resulted in settlement or that he understood the anti-competitive import of the agreements 
finally reached.  Thus it cannot be said that he brought with him to ARCT, Inc. any guilty knowledge of the conspiracy.  See 
United States v. Wilshire Oil Company, 427 F.2d 969 (10th Cir. 1970). "
1073,23," The cases are collected in an annotation in 62 A.L.R.2d 1369, where the annotator makes this interesting observation: ""The cases involving the running of limitations against so-called civil actions for conspiracy present a melange of 
inconsistent, irreconcilable, even contradictory statements of general 'rules' relating to the subject.  This is, perhaps, not 
surprising in view of the vague, poorly defined scope of this kind of civil suit."" Id. at 1385. "

1074,24," In view of the inordinate amount of time required to try and decide these complex cases the court has deemed it appropriate to 
decide all the issues involved in the trial notwithstanding the previous finding of antitrust liability on the part of DMRC, DMI and 
Chavanoz might well be regarded as mooting the patent misuse, validity and infringement issues.  In this way it is hoped that 
decision on appeal may be final as to all liability issues."
1074,25," For a critical analysis of the misuse doctrine see Nicosin, ""Misuse of the Misuse Doctrine in Infringement Suits"", 9 UCLA Law 
Review 76 (1962). See also Wallace, ""Proper Use of Misuse Doctrine"", 26 Mercer Law Review 813 (1975), where it is said: ""The frequent jest that the massive financial and time burdens of complex patent litigation result in everybody's loss except 
the lawyer's may not be far from the truth."" "
1075,26," Paragraph 2 of the agreement recites that ""DMRC has already furnished to licensee certain technical information relative to 
the present inventions which licensee acknowledges"", but there is no evidence that DMRC actually furnished its licensees with 
anything except the license form to be signed and returned.  The licensee was entitled, however, to send its engineers or other 
personnel ""to DMRC or its designee"" for the purpose of obtaining instructions in the practice of the inventions."
1075,27," In a letter to Waters of Whitin dated June 6, 1963, DMRC's patent counsel, Walter E. Mueller, indicated that of the eight United 
States patents issued to Chavanoz prior to that time only two, Nos. 2,891,375 and 2,944,319, were applicable to ARCT 
commercial machines. The two patents which were applicable did not issue until after the first ARCT machines had been sold 
and licensed in this country.  Of the twenty-two patents eventually included in the standard DMRC royalty agreement and "
1076,," asserted against the plaintiffs in this action, two of the patents, Nos. 3,137,119 and 3,382,656, have been held invalid by Judge 
Hemphill and twelve others, Nos.  2,741,893; 2,761,272; 2,780,047; 2,788,634; 2,823,513; 2,823,514; 3,117,861; 3,117,410; 
3,166,881; 3,237,392; 3,333,409; and 3,473,313, have been held by him not to have been infringed by the plaintiffs."

1077,30," In his letter to McClure of May 23, 1961, Armitage said: "
1078,," ""This agreement which we have submitted is a standard license form.  It is the only form of license which we are authorized 
to offer under our basic agreement with Chavanoz.  It covers the inventions under all issued patents and pending patent 
applications . . ."" (PX 215)."
1078,31," In answer to a letter dated September 13, 1963, from George Simmons of the patent department of Rohm & Haas Company in 
which he sought to have pending patent applications excluded from the license DMRC wrote: ""[We] are not in a position to permit you to exclude the pending patent applications from the license. Our basic agreement 
with Chavanoz requires that the sub-licenses granted by us embrace the scope of the license which we ourselves have 
from Chavanoz, and we are therefore compelled by our agreement with them to license under existing patents and existing 
patent applications."" (PX 217). "
1079,32," The earlier Tenth Circuit case, McCullough Tool Company v. Well Surveys, Inc., 343 F.2d 381 (10th Cir. 1965), appears in fact 
to be distinguishable.  The lower court in that case had found that the license agreements were not coerced but that the 
licensees had been offered licenses under individual patents on negotiated terms. On the subject of post-expiration royalties see ""The Misuse Doctrine and Post-Expiration-Discriminatory and Exorbitant Patent 
Royalties"", 43 Ind. L.J. 106 (1967-68), and ""Proper Use of the Patent Misuse Doctrine"", 26 Mercer L.R. 813 (1975). "
1080,33," Armitage testified at Tr. 20, p. 4070, that: ""[The plaintiffs] paid the same royalty regardless of whether a particular patent covered a feature of his machine as long as 
any patent or patent application or invention upon which it was expected to get patent coverage was embodied in that 
machine, and he paid no more for nine features than he did for one."" And again at Tr. 21, p. 4411-12 he testified: ""Q: . . . Is it contemplated that upon the expiration of that patent the royalty rate would be reduced? ""A: It wasn't contemplated by me. ""Q: Now, Dr. Armitage, Mr. Mueller said that that patent [U.S. Patent No.  2,780,047] was not used on any of the ARCT 
machines. Did you and Mr. Soep discuss or consider the reduction in royalties of the patent if the patent wasn't used? ""A: No, never . . . Certainly it never crossed my mind that there should be a difference."""
1080,34," DMRC's vice president and patent counsel testified that the royalty rate proposed to be charged a new licensee in August, 
1976, ""in our view was a satisfactory rate for any one of the patents"" (Tr. 83, p. 16037), but the court can hardly accept that as 
evidence that any one of the patents was in fact worth the full amount of the royalty charged or that DMRC so regarded it in 
earlier years when the plaintiffs here entered into their agreements with DMRC."

1081,36," That there was ample room for ""improvement"" is perhaps best illustrated by Judge Hemphill's ruling herein on a motion for 
summary judgment that patent No.  2,741,893 was not infringed by any Throwster for the simple reason that the uncontradicted 
evidence showed that a substantial part of the twist was not in fact arrested within the heating medium.  Duplan Corporation v. 
Deering Milliken, Inc., 370 F. Supp. 769 (D.S.C. 1973). This patent and its accompanying drawing illustrating the ""invention"" are 
set forth as an appendix to Judge Hemphill's decision.  370 F. Supp. 788-9."
1081,37," In a revision of the Chavanoz-ARCT agreement in 1971 the grant-back clause was rewritten in greater detail, but its essential 
provisions remained unchanged (PX 765)."
1081,38," Four of the eight patents remaining in suit were ARCT inventions: Nos. 2,944,319; 3,232,037; 3,283,414; and 3,584,450.  A 
fifth, No. 3,165,881, was the joint invention of Crouzet of ARCT and deMoncuit of Chavanoz. "

Stedman, ""Acquisition of Patents and Know-How by Grant, Fraud, Purchase and Grant-Back"", 28 U.Pitt. L.R. 161 (1966)."
1082,40," The facts relating to the acquisition by Chavanoz of the '037 patent after this litigation was well underway are set forth in 
plaintiffs' adopted findings 14.86-14.89, inclusive. Briefly, this ARCT patent on a monoroll spindle was never regarded by 
Chavanoz or ARCT-France as covered by the grant-back clause in their agreement until after this litigation had been 
commenced, and the plaintiffs here who purchased machines embodying this invention acquired an implied right to use them 
free of the use right claims of Chavanoz and DMRC based on their attempted acquisition of the '037 patent rights evidenced by 
the actual assignment from ARCT-France to Chavanoz first recorded in the United States Patent Office on November 16, 1970.  
Even if the patent were valid (and the court finds later that it was not) in no event would it be enforceable against any Throwster 
who purchased a machine prior to the date of the assignment, November 4, 1970.  This subject is discussed more fully infra in 
the section on patent validity and infringement. "
1083,41," The court finds particularly reprehensible the attitude of one patent counsel, described as a DMRC ""internal patent man"", as 
expressed in a memorandum to DMRC's patent attorney concerning a pending DMRC patent application when he said: ""ICI patent does not disclose storing a heat-set yarn on a pirn and it might well be that it would be held by the patent office 
or by a court that, this being a foreign reference patent, it did not suggest a yarn within the scope of the above claim.  Of 
course, unless someone else called it to the attention of the examiner, there would be no need for him to know that the 
above claim would read upon a heat-set ICI yarn stored on a pirn."
1083,*," * * ""I think this would, however, slip past the examiner . . . [Unless] the examiner puts two and two together from reading 
DMRC's hot-stretch patent applications, he will not know that a claim of the above type will read upon a thermally relaxed or 
hot-stretched yarn passed about a cold blade member."" (PX 890.) While a patent applicant is not required to ""list out the full spectrum of his knowledge to establish [his] bona fides"", Eli Lilly & 
Company v. Generix Drug Sales, Inc., 460 F.2d 1096, 1102-3 (5th Cir. 1972), one who deliberately conceals material information 
from the Patent Office is just as culpable as one who willfully misrepresents the facts.  See Kearney & Trecker Corporation v. 
Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F.2d 579, 594 (7th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1066, 31 L. Ed. 2d 796, 92 S. Ct. 1500 (1972)."

abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated."" Morton Salt Company v. Suppiger,

Corporation, 132 F.2d 947 (4th Cir. 1943). See further, Kins, ""Dissipation of Patent Misuse"", 1968 Wis. L.R. 918. "
1084,43," In an effort to rebut defendants' purge defense plaintiffs also offered evidence of discussions between DMRC's patent counsel 
and counsel for a third party in August, 1976 (while the trial of these cases was in progress) to show that DMRC was continuing 
its compulsory package licensing program, but the court has the definite impression that this meeting was arranged for 
evidence-gathering purposes, and that statements made by DMRC's counsel at that meeting should not be used against DMRC 
in this case.  The court notes, however, that in the three cases settled during the course of the trial the license agreements all 
provide for a single royalty irrespective of the number of patents used (PX 1229, 1230 and 1231; Tr. 83-16025)."
1084,44," The possibility of employing this defense was first suggested in Automatic Radio Manufacturing Company v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 176 F.2d 799, 805 (1st Cir. 1948), where the court stated: ""[It] is indeed nowhere alleged that Automatic had sought and been refused a license covering less than all of Hazeltine's 
patents. This particular contention has not been pressed on appeal as a separate ground of defense."" In affirming this decision the Supreme Court adverted to the fact that the point had not been pressed on appeal and was 
therefore not considered.  Id., 339 U.S. 827, 831, 70 S. Ct. 894, 94 L. Ed. 1312 (1950). See also 28 U. Pitts. L.R. 207 (1966), 
and 44 Va. L.R. 727 (1958). "
1085,45," Although the court is unable to agree with plaintiffs that Armitage was ""a man to whom the truth was an irrelevancy"" (Tr. 87-
16778), we have his own word for it that while he would tell ""the truth and nothing but the truth,"" he did not always tell ""the whole 
truth"" (Tr. 21-4367).  The statement had reference to a letter which Armitage wrote to a Throwster in 1965 in which he stated in 
effect that the judgment of the Canadian court in the Leesona-Scragg litigation (see slip op. at p. 37, supra) had no material 
effect on the settlement of the Leesona-Whitin litigation in the United States, this statement being in marked contrast to 
Armitage's deposition testimony in 1972 in which he testified that the favorable decision obtained by Leesona in Canada played 
a major part in persuading DMRC and Chavanoz to settle the Leesona-Whitin litigation.  The following are other examples of 
evidence which have influenced the court's appraisal of Armitage as a witness and as a businessman: Although Armitage never bothered to inform himself as to which of the Chavanoz patents applied to the ARCT machines (Tr. 20-
4126), he had no hesitance in warranting to Attorney McClure ""that each of the patents and patent applications listed in 
Appendix 'A' of the agreement covers one or more features of the FT machines ordered or purchased by the licensee or its 
agent . . ."", a representation which was grossly erroneous.  (McClure's letter to Armitage of August 31, 1961 -- PX 410.) Nor did 
Armitage have any explanation as to why several patents were routinely listed in Appendix ""A"" referred to in the license 
agreements which DMRC's patent attorney, Walter E. Mueller, had stated in a letter as early as June 6, 1963 (with copy to 
Armitage) were not applicable to the ARCT machines (PX 97; Tr. 20-4129). In his correspondence with McClure (PX 215 and 410) Armitage stated unequivocally that royalties were payable for the use of 
the machines embodying both patents and ""technical information"", but in his deposition testimony he stated ""we have never 
asserted under this or any other paragraph a right to collect royalties on anything except inventions."" (Tr. 20-4103.) In his letter of April 22, 1961, to Attorney McClure (PX 215) Armitage stated that, contrary to the statement in the license 
agreement itself, Appendix A was normally furnished licensees only ""upon request"" after the license was signed.  In his 
deposition testimony (Tr. 20-4111), in answer to a question as to whether it was his policy not to attach Appendix A, Armitage 
said, ""No, on the contrary, the policy was to send it out.  What the practice was, I don't know how many times it got sent out and 
how many times it got omitted.  It was a sort of secretarial function.  They were supposed to attach it to the agreement."" In writing to the French conseil en brevets, Leo Soep, in response to an inquiry concerning the effect of becoming involved in an 
antitrust violation Armitage wrote: "". . . It is a fact of life here that no one imputes any dishonesty to a corporation for breaking the antitrust laws.  And the 
business community does not attach obloquy to anyone who seeks to improve his own business situation by establishing a 
monopoly."" (PX 435.) When the proposal to form ARCT, Inc. to replace Whitin as the sales agent for ARCT-France in the United States was broached 
to Armitage by the principals of the French company he seemed genuinely pleased by the news and expressed his pleasure to 
Waters (Tr. 80-15557; PX 209), but only a short time later in response to a request by Leo Soep for his comment on the new 
sales arrangement Armitage indicated a total lack of confidence in Waters' ability to perform adequately in competition with 
Whitin, stating: "
1086,," ""Also, as I am sure you know, while Bob Waters has done a terrific sales job over the past few years, he has also made 
some enemies, and Whitin will be able to capitalize, not only on Bob's errors and mistakes, but also on errors and mistakes 
of Whitin which they can now blame on him!"" (DX 752.) The witness, Ward Smith, now president of White Consolidated Industries, Inc., of Cleveland, Ohio, but formerly house counsel 
for Whitin, gave some very interesting testimony concerning Armitage: Q: . . . Since he played such a big role in the events relevant to the case, and since his death has deprived us of the 
opportunity to have his live testimony, the court has expressed some interest in learning something about Dr. Armitage, 
what kind of man he was . . . And I wonder if you could describe your impression of Dr. Armitage. A: Dr. Armitage has got to be one of the most fascinating people I ever met in my life.  He was a predatory negotiator . . . 
And unfortunately he found easy game at Whitin.  On the other hand, he was courteous, he was kind, he was a gentlemen, 
I think in the truest sense of the word, but when you sat down across the table from Dr. Armitage you just held on to 
everything and prayed . ..  I was thoroughly impressed with this man, he was quite a guy, and he obviously, you know, did a 
real job on the Whitin Machine Works as far as I was concerned.  I used to become enraged with him . . . I don't know what 
it was but he mesmerized the people at Whitin Machine Works and I expect everybody else with whom he did business. Q: . . . Did you not advise the management of Whitin that Whitin should repudiate a contract made with Deering Milliken 
Research Corporation because it was unconscionable? A: Yes, sir. (Tr. 67, p. 12953-5.) In a letter to Soep dated April 30, 1960 (PX 215) Armitage recommended issuance of a royalty-free license to a Throwster for a 
short experimental period explaining that this would be an innocuous way of getting the recalcitrant Throwster to sign a license 
and at the same time would encourage others to sign when told about this Throwster's signing ""without details"". And finally, commenting on the ""yes, yes, yes"" recorded telephone conversation between Armitage and Davis of Leesona (PX 
222) counsel for DMRC said during the course of the trial: ""Armitage didn't know that Davis trusted him so little that he had a secretary listening in on the conversation."" (Tr. 12-2352), 
and ""Mr. Davis, who knew Norman Armitage from way back, was fearful that Armitage in this settlement was putting something 
over on him."" (Tr. 88-16875.)"
1086,46," As in the antitrust cases the court feels that in applying the misuse doctrine ""plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their 
proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" 
Continental Ore Company v. Union Carbide Company, 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962). "
1087,47," A threshold question posed by the plaintiffs -- that they acquired at the time of purchase an implied license to use the six 
apparatus patents under the exhaustion doctrine -- has heretofore been decided against plaintiffs (see slip op. at p. 19, supra).  
A list of the twenty-two patents originally involved is attached as Appendix D which also shows the fourteen patents which have 
been taken out of the litigation by Judge Hemphill's prior rulings of invalidity or non-infringement."
1087,48," The '375 patent expired just a few days after the trial of this case began on June 14, 1976."
1087,49, See diagram in Appendix A for an illustration of the components of the basic false twist texturing apparatus. 
1089,50," Although the defendants produced reams of evidence attesting the heat uniformity achieved by a curved tube made from heat 
resistant material and heated by passing an electric current through it, this evidence is relevant only to claims 1 and 2 of the '375 
patent to be considered later. "
1090,51," Plaintiffs' expert witness testified that the language of claim 3 encompassed means other than heating the walls by passing 
electric current through them, Tr. 4, p. 757, and this testimony was implicitly corroborated by the testimony of defendants' expert 
when he testified that since the heaters on the later ARCT machines were heated both by the resistance of electricity passing 
directly through the walls of the tube and also by electrical wires wound around the outside of the tube, both methods of heating 
would constitute ""a means for heating the walls of said tube"" within the meaning of claim 3.  Tr. 52, p. 10,236. "
1093,52," In his order of May 7, 1973, denying a motion for summary judgment as to the '375 patent Judge Hemphill said: ""This court has heretofore commented on what Lincoln Engineering (supra) has propounded as the law of the land: That 
the improvement of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which 
would perform no new function in the combination.  Lincoln also held, however, that where the improvement brings about a 
new or improved result, or the performance of a new function, that the fact that the old elements were included would not 
be ground for invalidity, but would be ground for validity."" It is clear, however, that by this statement Judge Hemphill did not mean to imply that the requirement of co-action of the old 
elements with the improved element could be dispensed with simply by a showing that the improvement brings about a ""new or 
improved result"", for in a subsequent order entered June 19, 1973, following re-argument on the motion Judge Hemphill 
responded to defendants' argument ""centered upon an insistence that patent '375 was a combination apparatus producing 
improved yarn"" by quotations from Anderson's-Black Rock including the following: ""We conclude that while the combination of old elements performed a useful function, it added nothing to the nature and 
quality of the radiant-heat burner already patented. Use of the radiant-heat burner in this important field marked a 
successful venture.  But as noted, more than that is needed for invention."" 396 U.S. 57 at pp. 62-63. "
1095,53," 35 U.S.C. § 112 reads in pertinent part as follows: ""The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in 
such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most 
nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his 
invention. ""The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter 
which the applicant regards as his invention. ""A claim may be written in independent or dependent form, and if in dependent form, it shall be construed to include all the 
limitations of the claim incorporated by reference into the dependent claim."""
1095,54," ""It is clear to us that appellants' claims define subject matter which they regard as their invention. The fact that appellants have 
invented an improved muffler per se does not, in our opinion, mean that the present claims do not also define what they regard 
as their invention. Obviously, appellants' muffler has little use per se; it was intended and is to be used in an internal combustion "
1096,," system.  It is believed therefore that the present claims merely reflect this fact by setting forth the improved feature in association 
with its intended environment.  We note that the claims, set forth as a combination of elements, recite the muffler in terms no 
broader than those in the patent to the muffler per se."" Ex Parte Barber, 187 U.S.P.Q. 244, 246 (1974)."
1096,55," ""From this enumeration of the provisions of the act, it is clear that the party cannot entitle himself to a patent for more than his 
own invention; and if his patent includes things before known, or before in use, as his invention, he is not entitled to recover, for 
his patent is broader than his invention. If, therefore, the patent be for the whole of a machine, the party can maintain a title to it 
only by establishing that it is substantially new in its structure and mode of operation.  If the same combinations existed before in 
machines of the same nature up to a certain point, and the party's invention consists in adding some new machinery, or some 
improved mode of operation, to the old, the patent should be limited to such improvement, for if it includes the whole machinery, 
it includes more than his invention and therefore cannot be supported."" Evans v. Eaton, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 356, 430-431, 5 L. 
Ed. 472 (1822). "
1098,56," Citing Reynolds v. Whitin Machine Works, 167 F.2d 78 (4th Cir. 1948), defendants make the point that the sheer number of 
patents cited against the '375 patent is evidence of its non-obviousness.  As a practical matter, however, it is difficult to see how 
the scope and content of the prior art can be accurately assessed without looking at the art as it has developed, and this may 
very well involve looking at a number of patents. "
1100,57," The court has considered defendants' argument that at least some of the patents (notably Gilchrist) cited by plaintiffs were 
unworkable ""paper patents"", and thus not entitled to weight in determining the scope of the prior art.  For this proposition 
defendants cite Bowser, Inc. v. Richmond Engineering, 166 F. Supp. 68 (E.D.Va. 1958), modified, 264 F.2d 595 (4th Cir. 1959). 
More recent holdings on this subject from the Fourth and other circuits are contra.  As stated by Judge Widener in Blohm & Voss 
v. Prudential-Grace Lines, Inc., 489 F.2d 231, 240 (4th Cir. 1973), ""the issuance of the patent, however, creates a presumption 
that it is workable (citations omitted) and the alleged unworkability of a patent does not necessarily preclude its relevance in 
ascertaining the scope and content of the prior art . . .."" A more complete discussion of this issue is found in Sutter Products 
Company v. Pettibone Mulliken Corporation, 428 F.2d 639 (7th Cir. 1970), at pp. 646-647. The court concludes, therefore, that the prior patents should be given the full effect of what they disclose, even where there is no 
evidence that a particular patent ever resulted in a commercially saleable machine. "
1101,58," ""Heaters made by Leesona and by all other machinery manufacturers conformed to the conventional wisdom that (a) in 
intentional contact heating of the yarn, the operator had to have direct access to the heater surface; and (b) if yarn was heated 
by running it through a tube, the tube had to be straight and yarn contact with the tube had to be avoided.  Chavanoz rejected 
this 'wisdom', departed radically from all prior heaters, and came up with the first commercially satisfactory heater."" Defendants' 
trial brief, pp. 22-23. "
1102,59," Perhaps the most graphic example of this is the fact that plaintiffs' expert, Mattingly, worked for years in England on 
developing a magnetic spindle only to conclude in the end that he had discovered nothing after he was shown the Heinze patent 
for a magnetic spindle which had issued in the United States more than sixty years before. "
1103,60," The Supreme Court has counseled the lower courts to decide the validity issue in all patent cases rather than let them go off 
on the question of infringement because ""of the two questions, validity has the greater public importance."" Sinclair & Carroll 
Company, Inc. v. Interchemical Corporation, 325 U.S. 327, 330, 89 L. Ed. 1644, 65 S. Ct. 1143 (1945). "
1105,61," See, for instance, Graver Tank & Manufacturing Company v. Linde Air Products Company, 339 U.S. 605, 608-09, 94 L. Ed. 
1097, 70 S. Ct. 854 (1950); Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Company, 170 U.S. 537, 42 L. Ed. 1136, 18 S. Ct. 707 
(1898); Marvin Glass & Associates v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 448 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir. 1971); Wilcox Manufacturing Company v. 
Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates, 400 F.2d 960 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1051, 21 L. Ed. 2d 693, 89 S. Ct. 691

General Electric Company, 348 F.2d 985 (4th Cir. 1965). "
1108,62," In reaching this conclusion the court has given thought to the usual secondary considerations urged by defendants, that is, 
long-felt need, commercial success and solution of earlier problems (see defendants' proposed findings of fact hereinafter 
adopted), but it is settled that these factors are not controlling where there is lack of invention. Kamei-Autokomfort v. Eurasian 
Automotive Products, 553 F.2d 603, 606 (9th Cir. 1977)."
1108,63," It is interesting to note that ARCT apparently attributed very little merit to this invention by its president, Henri Crouzet, either 
as an aid to cleaning heater tubes or as producing greater condensation in the removable tube insert.  It employed the device 
only on its earlier model machines and thereafter discontinued its use altogether.  Only the plaintiffs, Burlington Industries, Inc., 
and Schwartzenbach-Huber, who were continuing to use some of the earlier models at the time of the trial, were charged with 
infringement of the '319 patent."
1108,64," In Figure 2 in the drawings this is the point where the ""Z"" hatch marks on the heater tube end and the ""S"" hatch marks on the 
insert tube begin."
1108,65," This is the ""insulating ring"" referred to in the patent. See ""Figure 8"" in Figure 2 of the drawings. "
1109,66," While there is testimony from defendants' expert (Tr. 54, pp. 10,615-18) that the ring performs this function, and other 
testimony that the FT-1 and FTF machines were always shipped with these rings in place and that replacements were 
periodically made available (Tr. 70, pp. 13,541-42), there is equally probative testimony by a witness for plaintiffs that these rings 
burned up and disintegrated quickly after the machines were in operation (Tr. 70, p. 13,592), and that their chief function was not 
to insulate but rather to provide support for the insert tube (Tr. 8, pp. 1595-96). "

1111,68," ""Overfeed"" is defined as ""a device that feeds yarn continuously to a winding mechanism, the linear speed of the yarn through 
the feeding device being greater than the linear speed of the yarn taken up by the winding mechanism."" Hathorne, ""Woven 
Stretch and Textured Fibers,"" p. 5. "
1113,69," At Column 1, Line 47, the patent states "". . . but in this specification no distinction is made between yarns processed with the 
different types of twisting apparatus, and all such yarns are referred to as 'torque elasticized' yarns."" It also discloses that an 
overfeed of from 5 to 20% generally gives the best results in performing the thermal post-treatment operation on torque 
elasticized (false twist) yarns (Column 12, Lines 21-30). "
1122,70," Claim 6, another dependent claim, which calls for a false twisting and yarn heating assembly including ""a pair of convex 
tubular heaters"", is not in issue in this case since none of the ARCT machines owned or operated by the plaintiffs embodied this 
feature."
1122,71," Since all of the ARCT machines since the earliest models have embodied the multi-frame, platform features disclosed in the 
patent, and all of the plaintiffs own some of the machines embodying these features, infringement is not a serious issue with 
respect to this patent. One late model ARCT machine, the FTF-490, has a triple frame arrangement, the one in the middle 
containing one of the heaters and the take-up packages with the voluminizing and supply package frames being disposed to 
either side.  One of the plaintiffs, Texfi, contends that its FTF-490 machines do not infringe the '881 patent, but the court has 
concluded that claim 1 does in fact read directly on this machine. Thus the only real defense to this patent is its alleged invalidity. "
1124,72," For two illuminating discussions of the ""on sale"" defense see Zieg, ""Developments in the Law of 'On Sale'"", Vol. 58, p. 470, 
Journal of Patent Office Society (1976), and Barrett, ""New Guidelines for Applying the On Sale Bar to Patentability"", 24 Stanford 
Law Review 730 (1972). "
1125,73,"  ""Q.  [Suppose] you were faced in 1958 with a yarn path as on the ARCT machine and didn't have a platform, but assume 
further that you were not instructed to provide some means for protecting the yarn or crossing over it . . . what would you 
have done then? ""A.  I find these hindsight hypotheticals a little bit difficult, but if I was directed to beam all my attention to designing a 
platform, I imagine I would have come up with something, but I don't think it would have been quite as practical and cute as 
that solution."" (Tr. 71, pp. 13874-75.) "
1127,74," Defendants' contention that the prior art in textile machinery other than that in the false twist field should not be considered is 
without merit.  Digitronics Corporation v. New York Racing Association, Inc., 553 F.2d 740 (2nd Cir. 1977). ""In determining the scope of the relevant prior art with which the hypothetical ordinarily skilled person must be presumed to 
be familiar, we hold simply that the court must look, in light of both the training of the patentee and the elements in the 
claimed invention which give it its novel quality, at what arts the patentee could reasonably be expected to consult in doing 
the inventing."" Id. at p. 745. The evidence shows that the manufacturers of false twist machines, including ARCT-France, also manufactured various other 
lines of textile machinery. Crouzet of ARCT and de Moncuit of Chavanoz could reasonably have been expected to consult the 
art available in the manufacture of textile machinery generally. Defendants' reliance on the skill of yarn processors to establish the level of skill in the art is likewise misplaced.  The question is 
not what would have been obvious to a user of false twist machines but what would have been obvious to one skilled in the art of 
designing and building textile machinery. Systematic Tool & Machine Company v. Walter Kidde & Company, 555 F.2d 342 (3rd 
Cir., decided March 25, 1977). "
1128,75," This patent raises no serious infringement issue, since plaintiffs admit that if valid and enforceable, claims 1, 2 and 5 of the 
'037 patent are infringed by the monoroll spindle employed on a variety of ARCT machines used by plaintiffs (DX 240).  
Additionally, the court finds that claims 12 - 14 would also be infringed, since plaintiffs' own expert testified that the ARCT 
monoroll spindle contains ""spaced discs, the peripheries of which are in driving contact with the spindle"" as required by these 
claims of the '037 patent. (Tr. 44, p. 8770.) "
1129,76," It seems to be standard operating procedure for many practitioners before the Patent Office to downplay any prior art which 
might constitute an obstacle to patentability.  See, for instance, Footnote 41, supra, and Robbins Company v. Dresser Industries, 
Inc., 554 F.2d 1289, 1292 (5th Cir. 1977), a practice which this court finds highly questionable in view of the high standards of 
forthrightness and candor required of such practitioners."
1129,77," Assuming without deciding that mention of a prior art patent in the specification is equivalent to citation to the examiner, the 
citation of the most pertinent prior art does not preclude a judgment of invalidity where such is conclusively established.  See 
Deering Milliken Research Corporation v. Beaunit, 538 F.2d 1022 (4th Cir. 1976)."
1129,78," Defendants also assert that the '037 patent differs from Heinze in that it teaches and claims a novel configuration of chamfered 
magnet pole tips with faces having approximately the diameter of the spindlette.  The file wrapper (PX 819) indicates that this 
feature was rejected by the patent examiner as not being inventive.  The argument was abandoned, and the patent issued with 
the placement of magnets as its asserted inventiveness.  Patentee is not free to urge here what was rejected there.  Micro-
probe, Inc. v. Wentworth Laboratories, Inc., 431 F. Supp. 238 (C.D.Cal. 1977). General Mills, Inc. v. Standard Brands Inc., 431 
F. Supp. 687 (E.D.Tenn. 1977). Nor do defendants' assertions that their device requires less power and operates more quietly equate with patentability.  The 
more efficient use of power over the biroll spindle would certainly have been obvious to a person of skill in the art at the time of 
the patenting of the monoroll spindle, while quietness of operation appears to have been an unexpected result nowhere 
disclosed or claimed. "
1130,79," Defendants criticized the model made by Mr. Mattingly to illustrate his testimony, contending that he both departed from the 
teachings of Heinze and followed the teachings of the '037 patent in making his model. Specifically, they contend that the 
smooth spindle employed by Mattingly (PX 871) is not specifically described in the Heinze patent; that it is not entirely 
magnetizable, but instead, has non-magnetic ends, while the spindle described in Heinze appears to be completely 
magnetizable; and that the magnet pole tips on the model (PX 870) were slightly flattened, the pole tips in the Heinze patent 
drawings appear almost pointed.  Each of the differences of which defendants complain appeared in the prior art, if not in the 
Heinze patent itself, well prior to the earliest invention date upon which defendants can rely for the '037 patent. With respect to 
defendants' objection concerning the pole tips, it is undisputed that flattened pole tips were used in the prior biroll spindles which 
Crouzet used as the starting point for the '037 patent. Also, the spindlettes for biroll spindles were only partially magnetizable.  In 
fact, they had a magnetic center portion and non-magnetic ends.  Finally, smooth spindlettes were well known in the prior art 
prior to 1963.  Indeed, Crouzet's sketch of the ""Ackermann spindle"", which was known to him prior to his invention, illustrates a 
smooth spindlette.  The court accepts Mr. Mattingly's testimony that in making his model he did not utilize any knowledge which 
he did not possess as early as 1962."
1130,80," United States Patent No.  3,313,096 issued to Marciniak (PX 869) discloses a biroll spindle where the magnet means are 
disposed externally of the drive means.  Marciniak also discloses disposing the magnet means internally of the drive means.  
Marciniak claims priority in France of April 19, 1963 which is prior to the '037's earliest priority date of April 26, 1963.  When 
considered with the Heinze arrangement (PX 771), Marciniak suggests that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in 
the spindle art to place the magnet means of Heinze either inside or outside the drive discs. "
1131,81," Although the record reveals that the monoroll spindle was a useful and profitable embodiment used extensively by the 
plaintiffs in this action, evidence of commercial success and long-felt need is unavailing to a patentee where, as here, invention 
is clearly lacking.  A & P Tea Company v. Supermarket Corporation, 340 U.S. 147, 153, 95 L. Ed. 162, 71 S. Ct. 127 (1950). "
1135,82," A venturi device works on the principle of having two pipes, one inside the other and the smaller one terminating inside the 
larger.  By blowing air through one pipe a suction is created that draws air in through the other pipe."

which the court later adopts as its own. "

patent. The doctrine is intended to discourage unscrupulous copyists who would otherwise make unimportant and insubstantial 
changes or substitutions which add nothing but would take the copied matter outside the protection of the patent law. "
1139,85," Plaintiffs have admitted that several ARCT models owned by many of them incorporate the cooling zone bulking attachment 
taught by the '450 patent, and their sole defense is the alleged invalidity of this patent. "
1140,86," In the initial rejection of the '450 patent application the examiner confirmed this view of the prior art by stating ""To employ 
specific guide surfaces . . . to regulate the tension in the yarn would not be patentable since it is old to employ frictional guide 
surfaces for this purpose. . . ."" (PX 1275).  The patent subsequently issued with ""unrestricted passage of twist"" as its asserted 
distinguishing feature. "
1142,87, Texfi's sub-license provides in paragraph 4: 
1143,," "". . . LICENSEE shall pay DMRC during the life of this agreement royalties in the amount of three and one-half per cent (3-
1/2%) of the manufacturer's list price of the raw yarn . . . which is converted to crimped yarn by LICENSEE according to the 
FT process or on FT machines. . . ."" (DX 702)."
1143,88," Adopted findings are those considered by the court to be most relevant to decision.  Unless rejected expressly or by 
implication in the text the court's failure to adopt other proposed findings is not to be construed as implicitly holding that other 
proposed findings are not supported by competent evidence in the record.  Aware of the criticism sometimes directed at the 
practice of district courts in adopting proposed findings, see Industrial Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corporation, 437 
F.2d 1336, 1339 (9th Cir. 1970), this court has checked the references cited in support of any such findings adopted and has 
assured itself that they are supported by the record. "
1144,89," See ""Laying the Ghost of the 'Invention' Requirement"" by the Honorable Giles A. Rich, Associate Judge of the United States 
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, a speech given to and published by the Patent Law Associations of Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, September, 1972."
1144,90," While this court would not associate itself with the views of one judge who characterized the United States Patent Office as the 
""sickest institution that our government has ever invented"" and ""the weakest link in the competitive system in America"", see 
Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, 456 F.2d 532 at p. 536 (8th Cir. 1972), it is not alone in its impression that patent examiners can be prevailed 
upon to issue patents on a wide variety of devices which do not always comport with statutory and constitutional requirements.  
In the present case Judge Hemphill had occasion to observe that: ""Writing patent claims is like trying to define the shape of a cloud.  If one can precisely define the shape of a cloud by 
detailing where all particular pieces go together, the Examiner will give a person a patent on it."" Duplan Corporation v. 
Deering Milliken, Inc., 379 F. Supp. 388 at p. 396, footnote 12 (D.S.C. 1974). "
1145,," That Judge Hemphill's observation may not be as whimsical as it sounds is perhaps best illustrated by PX 1313 introduced by 
plaintiffs' counsel in a moment of levity at the end of the trial.  It is United States Patent No.  3,936,384 issued on a bar of soap 
with a religious symbol impressed thereon.  Claim 1 reads ""a bar of soap which is embossed with religious markings."" Claims 2 
and 3 are dependent on claim 1. "

1186,3," These non-dramatic rights are called the ""small"" rights of musical compositions as opposed to the ""grand"" or dramatic rights. 
For a discussion of the distinction between these terms, see 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 125.6 (1976).  For our purposes it is 
enough to note that while ASCAP could normally license the performance of a song from, for example, My Fair Lady, it could not 
license the song in the context of a performance in whole or part of the play itself. Apparently, most uses of a musical "
1187,," composition by broadcasters, nightclubs and restaurants would be considered non-dramatic and therefore subject to license by 
ASCAP.  Throughout this opinion references to ""performing rights"" refer only to performing rights for profit in non-dramatic

musical programming. In any case, we understand that all three networks and virtually all commercial television stations in the 
United States hold ""annual"" blanket licenses. Under a per use license, on the contrary, the user would pay only for those compositions actually used during the program. "

1189,12," Judge Lasker had the benefit of the expert testimony of three distinguished economists, Franklin M. Fisher for CBS, Robert 
Nathan for ASCAP and Peter O. Steiner for BMI. The experts disagreed sharply on the likely future action of a direct negotiation 
market. Judge Lasker essentially accepted the Nathan view. He found that the market forces would tend to create a licensing 
agency similar to the Harry Fox Agency which handles synchronization rights. There was testimony that it would take probably 
six months to a year after CBS' announcement of its intention to go to direct licensing for a viable market to emerge and that, in 
the meantime, there would be some disinclination to deal with CBS with some attendant confusion. Mr. Nathan frankly 
conceded, however, that there is no actual evidence of the characteristics of a direct negotiation market in these circumstances, 
for it has never been tried."
1189,13," The writer generally assigns the right to license performing rights to the music publishers. Under the American Guild of 
Authors and Composers form contract, publishers are required to obtain an AGAC writer's consent for television synchronization 
licenses for songs over ten years old, and motion picture synchronization licenses for vocal use of a composition. The District 
Court, based on the testimony, found that ""there is every reason to believe that most writers would either give their publishers 
blanket consent for performance licenses, or give it promptly on a use-by-use basis, just as they presently do regarding synch 
rights."" 400 F. Supp. at 761. The upshot is that, as a practical matter, the networks would generally deal with publishers or 
through brokers or agencies of the publishers, rather than composers. See 400 F. Supp. at 760-62. "
1190,14," CBS also calls attention to one historical situation and to one current situation in support of its thesis that a direct negotiation 
market will not work. It contends that when Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company tried to negotiate individual licenses 
for performing rights on an experimental background music project, it allegedly met with frustration. The District Court found, 
however, that CBS' allegations concerning that situation were overstated and, in any case, did not support CBS' contentions 
here, 400 F. Supp. at 771-75. Its finding is not clearly erroneous. CBS also raises a subsidiary problem dealing with ""music in the can."" Each network now has a large inventory of recorded 
programs and motion picture films containing music for which it has synchronization rights but no performing rights other than 
those afforded by the ASCAP blanket license. CBS contends that since it lacks performing rights the copyright proprietor would 
have an enormous leverage to exact a premium, because, in the absence of a blanket license, appellant could not telecast the 
motion picture without the music owner's consent. There is a good deal of speculation in the record on what would happen to the 
amount of royalty for ""music in the can"" in various hypothetical situations, including testimony that CBS is so powerful a buyer 
that publishers could not afford to get into its bad graces. This is a question of fact and the District Court found that ""CBS has not 
proven that its fears of a 'holdup' by copyright proprietors are justified."" 400 F. Supp. at 776. In any event, it is hard to see how 
""music in the can"" problems will be solved by an injunction against blanket licensing. The individual licenses would still have to 
be negotiated with some of the same economic problems involved."
1190,15," ASCAP distributes about $1,000 ($400-$500 to the publisher or publishers; $400-$500 to the writer or writers) for each 
television network feature performance of an ASCAP composition (and correspondingly lower amounts for theme and 
background uses). The royalty is fixed by ASCAP and not by the licensee. Paragraph XI of the 1950 amended decree requires ASCAP to distribute royalties on ""a basis which gives primary consideration 
to the performance of the compositions . . . ."" Under the 1960 amendment, writers also have the option of receiving royalties 
under a plan which compensates them additionally for length of membership and the recognized status of their works. See 1960

such a ""market necessity"" defense would be applicable. "
1193,23," Cf.  United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 396-97, 71 L. Ed. 700, 47 S. Ct. 377 (1927). We also note that the 
costs of litigating the issue of what is a ""reasonable"" fee in the Southern District of New York would discourage some users from 
taking advantage of this provision in the decree. In fact, in the 27 year existence of the provision, the consent decree judge has 
never had to fix a ""reasonable"" fee for an ASCAP blanket license. Finally, we note that this defense would not be available to BMI because its consent decree has no provision providing recourse 
to the District Court to determine a ""reasonable"" fee in cases of disagreement between the parties."
1193,24," See Amicus Brief, supra note 20 at 14."
1193,25," We do not imply that a government consent decree should be given no weight at all, especially since the Department of 
Justice has the responsibility for enforcing the Sherman Act. But it is not even clear that the problems presented in this action 
are coeval with those which surfaced almost 30 years ago when this decree was negotiated. We have had a more recent 
indication of the government's views, moreover, in its amicus brief in K-91. "
1194,26," In not reaching the same result as the Ninth Circuit did in K-91, we, in no way, intimate that we would have held the blanket 
license to the single radio station to be unlawful, or that the blanket licenses given by ASCAP generally are unlawful. The K-91 
result was, in our view, entirely justifiable as an example of market necessity. Indeed, CBS concedes that market necessity 
would probably justify ASCAP blanket licenses for restaurants, night clubs, skating rinks and even radio stations."
1194,27," We recognize that CBS contends that a blanket licensing system overhanging the market in any combination of circumstances 
will necessarily affect the price for each set of individual performing rights. On this record we are not convinced that this is 
necessarily so. And the District Court found the contrary. CBS has asserted that an individual member of ASCAP, thrown into a direct negotiating market for the first time, will tend to 
measure the royalty he asks for a particular performing right by the royalty he has actually been receiving from ASCAP as his 
share under the blanket license. Considering the counterforce of the strong bargaining power of CBS, we cannot accept this as 
more than a theoretical assumption. Until some alternative method has actually been allowed to function for some time, 
contemporaneously with the blanket license, no man can say for certain that CBS' fears will prove inevitably to be true."
1194,28," On remand, we think it would be appropriate for the District Court to invite the Department of Justice to participate or express 
its view on the appropriate remedy. We also emphasize that in the foregoing discussion of remedy, ""ASCAP"" also includes appellant BMI. See note 1, supra. "
1195,29," As noted, CBS also claims violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. We need not go into the legal arguments on this point because 
they are grounded on its factual claim that there are barriers to direct licensing and ""bypass"" of the ASCAP blanket license. The 
District Court, as noted, rejected this contention and its findings are not clearly erroneous. The § 2 claim must therefore fail at 
this time and on this record. We dispose of CBS' claim of copyright misuse in the same manner and for essentially the same reasons as the § 1 claim. "

1199,1," Since the parties have been referred to in the briefs as plaintiffs and defendants, as they were in the district court, they will be

1201,3," A negative finding for the first question obviates the necessity for a determination with respect to the second and third steps,

1201,4," Relying on this general principle, plaintiffs argue that if the challenged activities do not clearly constitute the business of 
insurance, they fall outside the McCarran Act's protective umbrella and are subject to the full force and effect of the antitrust 
laws. "
1204,5," The court indicated the narrow scope of Travelers as follows: It is therefore readily apparent from the reading of the Travelers case that the Third Circuit is approving the actions of the 
Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania when he exerts pressure on the large insurance companies to get them to 
exercise their power over hospitals to force the hospitals to cut costs wherever possible. This is exactly what Blue Cross 
was doing in our case at the bequest of the Insurance Commissioner. Therefore, since the McCarran-Ferguson exemption 
was applicable in Travelers . . ., I hold today that the McCarran-Ferguson exemption is applicable in Doctors, Inc. . . . . 
Doctors, Inc. vs. Blue Cross, 431 F. Supp. 5, 10 (E.D.Pa.1975), aff'd 557 F.2d 1001 (3d Cir. 1976) (emphasis added)."
1204,6," The Court stated: It appears that, since the insurance contract confers far more benefits upon the policyholder if he uses an authorized 
funeral home, the policyholder is subtly coerced into dealing only with the authorized home.  The imposition of this restraint 
would effectively foreclose the unauthorized funeral director's access to a substantial portion of the market.  493 F.2d at 44-
45. The court held that these facts ""if established, would tend to support a finding of unreasonable restraint of trade."""
1204,493, F.2d at 44. 
1206,7," The McCarran Act likewise affords no antitrust exemption to the so-called noninsurance company defendants who are parties 
to this litigation. Indeed, it would be highly anomalous for this court to conclude that the sale of pharmaceuticals by these 
defendants constitutes the ""business of insurance"" for purposes of federal antitrust law. "

1211,3," As originally constituted in 1954, the DE plan required a prospective manager to contribute 25% of the dealership capital.  After 
1961, some individuals who could not afford a 25% investment were permitted to become involved in the DE program.  They 
would make contributions to an escrow account until the 25% plateau had been reached, after which point the plan operated as 
if the 25% investment had been made initially."
1211,4," The following dealerships were generally profitable and Chrysler's interest was bought out in the year indicated. Black Horse (1974) Cherry Hill Dodge (1972) Cinnaminson (1970) Jenkintown (1969) Northeast (1972) Roosevelt (1971) Springfield (1968) Woodbury (1968) The Willingboro dealership, unprofitable from 1964 to its closing in 1967, was reopened successfully in 1968 and was bought out 
in 1975.  Another dealership - Broadway - was unprofitable initially but became profitable in 1971 and remained a DE dealership 
at the time of trial. Seven dealerships were generally unprofitable and were closed.  The opening and closing dates are indicated below. Cherry Hill C/P (1963-1974) Crescent C/P (1962-1967) "

and was closed in 1971.  Two dealerships were sold to third parties. Hillside was profitable in 1967 but became unprofitable in 
1968, and its assets were sold to Mr. Elfman in 1969.  The Oxford dealership, formed in 1962, was unsuccessful and its assets 
were sold to an independently financed dealership in 1965. "
1213,5," There was no evidence, direct or indirect, that DE competition caused any dealership to close.  The stipulated facts showed no 
decrease in the total sales by privately owned dealerships in the period 1965-1969.  Even Mr. Elfman neither stopped selling 
Chrysler-Plymouth automobiles nor left the Philadelphia area.  Instead, he negotiated for and purchased the assets of a former 
DE dealer from Chrysler, in a transaction that he admitted was ""friendly."" Tr. p. 207-08. "
1214,6," Mr. Elfman admitted that he had additional money for advertising which he chose not to use for that purpose. ""Q.  You have ample funds available to you to have done that if you had wanted to, could you not? ""A.  Yes."" (Tr. 202). "
1215,7," There was a testimony relating to the purchase of 300 cars by a DE dealer in New Jersey.  Although pejoratively dubbed 
""dumping"" by Elfman's witness, Mr. Donald Jones, it was clear that these excess or ""sales bank"" cars were sold to all dealers 
who would buy them.  The point was not mentioned in Elfman's closing argument. Elfman also produced testimony to the effect that in 1965 - well outside of the ""damage"" period - his secretary purchased a 1965 
Valiant from a DE dealership at a price below dealer cost.  On cross-examination, Mr. Elfman admitted that the car ""was a 
leftover 1965 car which had been in the (DE) dealership for 10 months."" (Tr. 186). "
1216,8," Dr. Adams' computation was as follows.  Elfman's sales of 537 vehicles in 1965 represented 2.7% of the total of 19,591

1270,3," Plaintiff brings this Count under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, § 270a (1976)."
1270,4," It is also clear from Fitzgerald that, contrary to the assertions of the defendants, Section 262 is not limited to actions between 
competitors.  In Fitzgerald, the plaintiffs were buyers and sellers of real property who purchased title reports, title insurance, and 
other services from the defendant, Chicago Title & Trust Company, through the institutions which financed their transactions.  
Plaintiffs claimed that the defendant engaged in an unfair method of competition under Section 262 when it paid allowances to 
those institutions.  The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint, holding that the plaintiffs had 
stated a claim under Section 262 because the payments violated the basic policy of Section 2(c) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
13(c).  The plaintiffs and defendant in that action were not competitors."
1270,5," The courts should move very cautiously in construing the broad language of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act 
when it arises outside of the Commission's administrative process.  Congress gave the Commission a great deal of latitude in 
interpreting and enforcing the Act because it believed the Commission as constituted would have the expertise to recognize and 
remedy practices injurious to the public. See Atlantic Refining Co. v. FTC, 381 U.S. 357, 367, 14 L. Ed. 2d 443, 85 S. Ct. 1498 
(1965). We, however, do not have the benefit of such experience and expertise and should limit ourselves to types of conduct 
previously adjudged unlawful.  See Comment, Violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act as a Defense to Contract 
Enforcement Actions: The Problem and a Proposal, 71 Nw. U.L. Rev. 67, 82-85 (1976). The language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 
1/2, § 262 supports this cautious approach. "
1271,6," Some practices may be presumed to injure the public and thus such an allegation would be unnecessary.  For example, a 
businessman who ""passes off"" his goods as those of another -- a violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, §§ 312, 262 -- may be 
presumed to injure the public in creating confusion as to the origin of the goods.  Likewise, a claim that a party violated the letter 
or spirit of a specific antitrust law, e.g., Section 2(c) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(c), may not require the ""public injury"" 
allegation because Congress is presumed to have decided that such acts cause injury to the public.  See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. 
Chicago Title & Trust Co., 46 Ill. App. 3d 526, 361 N.E. 2d 94, 5 Ill. Dec. 94 (1977). Plaintiff, however, cannot avail itself of this latter exception by asserting that it stated a claim in Count III for a group boycott -- a 
per se violation of the Sherman Act. Paragraph 9 of the Third Amended Complaint, realleged in Count III, is too vague and 
conclusory to supply the horizontal element necessary to state a claim for group boycott. At best, plaintiff has only alleged a 
vertical restriction on its supply and such a restriction is not a per se violation of the Sherman Act. See Continental T. V., Inc., 
433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 45 U.S.L.W. 4828 (1977). Moreover, we seriously doubt that plaintiff, even with a 
sufficient horizontal conspiracy allegation, could state a claim under Section 262 on the theory that a violation of the Sherman 
Act and therefore of the FTC Act has been alleged.  The Illinois legislature indicated in Section 3(2) of the Illinois Anti-Trust Act, 
Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, § 60-3(2) (1976), that group boycotts are to be policed under the rule of reason and are not to be treated as 
per se violations.  We believe that it would defeat this intention for the courts to consider group boycotts as per se violations 
through the ""back door"" of Section 262.  Therefore, plaintiff would also have to allege an anti-competitive effect."
1271,7, Plaintiff argues that this precedent is not binding because it is dicta.  A careful reading of the opinion reveals that it is not dicta. 
1272,8," It is obvious from Lawrence Chrysler Plymouth that the existence of a ""control"" relationship sufficient to satisfy Section 1221(a) 
does not in itself justify piercing the corporate veil. The doctrine requires proof of three elements: ""Control by the parent to such a degree that the subsidiary has become its mere instrumentality; fraud or wrong by the 
parent through its subsidiary, e.g., torts, violation of a statute or stripping the subsidiary of its assets; and unjust loss or 
injury to the claimant, such as insolvency of the subsidiary."" Matter of Bowen Transports, Inc., 551 F.2d 171, 179 (7th Cir. 1977). The ""control"" must indicate ""[actual] domination, rather than 
the opportunity to exercise control."" Id. at 179."

1277,1," According to Sears' answer to one of plaintiff's interrogatories, after Sears' purchase of 750 shares of Upton Machine Co. in 
1925, ""the Upton Machine Company underwent major corporate changes, including merger with the Seeger Refrigeration 
Company in 1955, and The Birtman Electric Company in 1957.  The name of the resulting corporation was changed to Whirlpool 
Corporation in 1957."" "
1278,2," It is thus difficult to understand the dissent's view that there was ""no substantial evidence . . . offered to show that Oreck was 
terminated for some possible lawful reason . . . ."" (Emphasis supplied.)"
1278,3," The holdings of Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., 100 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418, cert. denied, 355 
U.S. 822, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38, 78 S. Ct. 29 (1957), and a similar case, Schwing Motor Co. v. Hudson Sales Corp., 138 F. Supp. 899 
(D. Md.), aff'd, 239 F.2d 176 (4th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 823, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38, 78 S. Ct. 30 (1957), were succinctly 
summarized in a case relied on by the dissent, Quality Mercury Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 542 F.2d 466 (8th Cir. 1976), as follows: 
""Both courts [Packard and Schwing] held that HN2[
] a manufacturer has a right to select his customers and may agree with 
one to exclude another, if, (1) the agreement is not a horizontal one between competitors; (2) the manufacturer is not using it to 
establish market dominance; or (3) the manufacturer is not using it to promote a monopoly."" 542 F.2d at 470. As is made clear in 
the remainder of this opinion, Whirlpool, as the manufacturer of vacuum cleaners, did not engage in a horizontal agreement 
between competitors, while Oreck submitted no substantial proof that Whirlpool's motive in cancelling Oreck was to establish 
market dominance or to promote a monopoly in the vacuum cleaner business. The dissent also relies on Quality Mercury, supra, for the proposition that a per se rule under § 1 of the Sherman Act becomes 
applicable when ""a horizontal, intrabrand competitor exercises a veto power over plaintiff's access to the manufacturer's goods 
or trademark . . . ."" The result in Quality Mercury, however, involving the refusal of Ford to grant a Lincoln dealership in the 
Minneapolis area allegedly because a preexisting dealership had veto power over such a decision, was to remand for trial in "
1279,," order to allow the plaintiff ""an opportunity to prove the unreasonableness of the restraint,"" 542 F.2d at 472, decidedly not a per 
se approach to the alleged Sherman Act violation."
1279,4," United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1125, 93 S. Ct. 938, 35 L. Ed. 2d 
256 (1973), cited in the dissent as limiting the Hawaiian Oke holding, was a case where hotels, restaurants and companies 
supplying those businesses in Portland, Oregon, organized an association to attract conventions to their city.  The association 
was financed by contributions from its members.  ""To aid collection, hotel members . . . agreed to give preferential treatment to 
suppliers who paid their assessments, and to curtail purchases from those who did not."" 467 F.2d at 1002. (Emphasis supplied.) 
Hilton Hotels thus involved a horizontal agreement between competitors at the same level, not the situation in Hawaiian Oke or 
the present case. "
1280,5," The dissent attempts to get around these facts by claiming that ""Sears was the equivalent of many Whirlpool vacuum cleaner 
distributors,"" a novel theory which simply transforms Sears into something it is not.  The implications of applying such a concept 
in future cases require the trial court to make legislative determinations.  When is a single company ""big"" enough to be 
considered tantamount to a series of ""little"" companies? The dissent presumably leaves the determination of what is a ""big"" 
company for this purpose of one case but not ""big"" for the purpose of another case, to the wisdom of the trial judge, in the 
complete absence of any criteria or standards which the court can apply. The dissent also charges the majority with looking not to substance but to form.  Perhaps the best rejoinder to such a 
characterization of our opinion is contained in Judge Medina's fine opinion in United States v. Morgan, 118 F. Supp. 621 
(D.N.Y. 1953), an action under §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act against seventeen investment banking firms charging a 
combination, conspiracy and agreement to restrain and monopolize the securities business in the United States, in which the 
court wrote: ""Much of the confusion, especially in the field of antitrust law, is due to the fact that the breadth and scope of the Sherman 
Act are so general and beneficent that lawyers and even judges often fail to heed repeated admonitions that each case 
must necessarily stand on its own legs, and that the conclusions reached in each depend largely upon the peculiar 
characteristics of the particular industry involved."" 118 F. Supp. at 688. In short, the facts and circumstances of this controversy do not call for the application of the per se rule against price fixing 
and/or group boycotts, so that the per se approach must not be dogmatically followed because it was used in other cases in 
which those factors were present.  Indeed, the dissent's attempt to convert this case into one involving a horizontal price fixing 
conspiracy itself might be characterized as looking to form rather than substance. "
1282,1," Payne's statements were never objected to by defendants as not within the scope of his employment by Whirlpool and are 
therefore admissible under Rule 801(d) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Judge Owen also instructed the jury, without objection 
by defendants, that defendants' failure to call Payne to the stand to explain or refute these statements, given his clear 
availability, may be taken to indicate that if called his testimony would have been unfavorable to defendants. "
1284,2," The proof of a conspiracy between Whirlpool and Sears was more than sufficient.  Indeed, a manufacturer may be held to 
violate § 1 of the Sherman Act ""irrespective of monopoly or conspiracy,"" when he refuses to deal with a distributor and thereby 
creates an ""arrangement"" in restraint of trade.  Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Co., 324 F.2d 566, 573 (4th Cir. 1963). The existence 
of a conspiracy and Sears' membership and participation could also be inferred from the totality of the course of conduct 
engaged in by the defendants, United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960); United 
States v. A.  Schrader's Son, Inc., 252 U.S. 85, 64 L. Ed. 471, 40 S. Ct. 251 (1920). The jury was entitled to rely, among other "
1285,," things, upon (1) Sears' purchase of 90 per cent of Whirlpool's annual production of vacuum cleaners and two-thirds of its 
production of all appliances, (2) Sears' position on the Whirlpool board, (3) its use of its own brand name (which decreased its 
reliance on Whirlpool as a source) and (4) Sears' traditional high price structure.  This evidence of a motive to maintain high 
prices and leverage over Whirlpool coincided with Whirlpool's irrational termination of an increasingly successful distributor, 
Oreck's entry into Sears' mail order domain at discount prices, the fact that ""an honorary director of Sears"" placed Oreck's mail 
order solicitation before the Whirlpool board, and Payne's statements to David Oreck admitting that Sears had applied pressure 
on Whirlpool.  Viewed as a whole the evidence clearly supported the jury's finding of conspiracy. "

had the lowest record in the preceding season and continuing to the team which had the best record, each team in each round 
of the draft selects one player. Under league rules the selecting team has the exclusive right to negotiate with the players it 
selected.  Several courts have suggested that similar draft systems may run afoul of the antitrust laws, on the ground that they 
eliminate competition for the services of the most talented athletes. See Denver Rockets v. All-Pro Management, Inc., 325 F.

also advertised in the afternoon paper.  In the case sub judice two distinguishable products are involved -- a service contract and 
a truck rental. "
1374,1," A complaint has also been filed by Twin Express, Inc., against the same defendants (except Twin does not sue Seatrain) 
arising out of the same facts. The suits have been consolidated for trial on the issue of liability. Twin has joined in Conex's 
motion for summary judgment, and both plaintiffs and all defendants have agreed to be bound by the Court's determination of 
this motion. Twin, like Conex, is a consolidator and corporation of Puerto Rico. Although the discussion in text will refer to 
Conex, it applies equally to the Twin suit, unless otherwise noted."
1374,2," Section 8 of the 1959 memorandum of settlement was entitled ""Containers-Dravo Size or Larger"" and provided: a.

is performed in the Port of Greater New York whether on piers or terminals controlled by them, or whether through direct 
contracting out, shall be performed by ILA labor at longshore rates. Notwithstanding this concession, union objections to container use continued and there is much support in the record for the

stuffed or stripped under the rules, then the steamship carrier shall pay, to the joint Container Royalty Fund liquidated 
damages of $250 per container which should have been stuffed or stripped. Such damages shall be used for the same

whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or 
otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person."

member with whom Conex has settled its claims); Sea-Land's manager of cargo operations; NYSA's administrative director; and 
Sea-Land's chairman of the board and chief executive officer. The ILA called Thomas Gleason, its international president since 
1963, and in the industry since 1915. "
1377,7," The critical portion of the Second Circuit opinion reads as follows: The following parts of [the NLRB] opinion seem to us controlling and convincing. . . . the disposition of this case turns on whether ILA's activities and its contractual agreements with NYSA had primary or 
secondary objectives.  If ILA's activities and its agreements with NYSA were designed to preserve work to which ILA-
represented employees working in the Port of New York were entitled, then both the activities and the contractual 
arrangements would be primary in purpose and, therefore, would not be unlawful.  However, if ILA's real object was to 
obtain either work traditionally performed by employees not represented by ILA or work to which ILA had abandoned all 
claims, then the pressures on NYSA members and the contractual arrangements would have a secondary object and would 
violate Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) and 8(e), respectively. As the United States Supreme Court instructed in National Woodwork 
Manufacturers Association v. N.L.R.B., ""the touchstone is whether the agreement or its maintenance is addressed to the 
labor relations of the contracting employer vis-a-vis his own employees."""
1377,*," * * * . . . in order to properly evaluate the validity of ILA's claim to the work, ""it is essential to define with some precision the work 
in controversy since that is the predicate upon which the issue of work preservation must turn."" It is clear from the record 
that the work in controversy here is the LCL and LTL container work performed by Consolidated and Twin at their own off-
pier premises. It is with this precise work in mind that the contentions of the parties must be evaluated. The traditional work of the longshoremen represented by ILA has been to load and unload ships. When necessary to 
perform their loading and unloading work, longshoremen have been required to stuff and strip containers on the piers. Similarly, for many years, maritime cargo has been sorted and consolidated off the docks by companies employing 
teamsters and unrepresented employees. With the advent of vessels designed exclusively to carry the large containers "
1378,," presently in use, these consolidating companies, such as Consolidated and Twin, have continued to consolidate shipments 
into containers prior to their placement aboard the vessels. The consolidators generate such work themselves, performing it 
not on behalf of the employer-members of NYSA but for their own customers who have goods to ship. Furthermore, they 
perform this consolidation work at their own off-pier premises, with their own employees who are outside the unit 
represented by ILA, and who fall within the coverage of separate collective-bargaining agreements, under which they are 
represented by other labor organizations. It is clear, therefore, that Consolidated and Twin have traditionally been engaged 
in the work of stuffing and stripping containers such as are here in controversy. From the foregoing and the record as a whole, it is clear that the on-pier stripping and stuffing work performed by 
longshoremen as an incident of loading and unloading ships does not embrace the work traditionally performed by 
Consolidated and Twin at their own off-pier premises. It does not fall within ILA's traditional role to engage in make-work 
measures by insisting upon stripping and stuffing cargo merely because that cargo was originally containerized by nonunit 
personnel. Yet, ILA's demands here could only be met if the work traditionally performed off the pier by employees outside 
the longshoremen unit were taken over and performed at the pier by longshoremen represented by ILA. Judge Feinberg dissented, arguing that the Board had erred in identifying the work in controversy. He maintained that the work 
which could be preserved without violating 8(e) must be defined as the generic category of preparation of cargo for shipment, 
not as the specific tasks currently being performed by the longshoremen. In his view, under the Board's and the majority theory, 
work preservation agreements would be virtually precluded where it could be established that other employees at other sites 
were doing or had done the work for which protection was sought. "
1379,8," The NLRB's definition of the work in controversy, approved by the Second Circuit, has come under critical attack. See Note, 
Work Recapture Agreements and Secondary Boycotts: ILA v. NLRB (Consolidated Express), 90 Harv.L.Rev. 815 (1977) (""The 
narrow view adopted in Consolidated Express, Inc. would restrict the collective bargaining process, thereby limiting its potential 
to ease the economic and social tension which accompany technological change."") The Third Circuit has expressly declined to comment on the validity of the Rules in this Circuit. See Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. 
Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 552 F.2d 985 n.5 (3rd Cir. 1977)."
1379,9," ILA charges that the Board's decision was motivated by policy considerations, rather than legal analysis. The Second Circuit, 
however, expressly based its enforcement of the Board's order on the sufficiency of the record to support the conclusion that the 
Rules on Containers had no valid work preservation objective. That Court expressly disavowed the Board's ""policy"" rationale. 
Moreover, it rejected the Board's finding with respect to ""abandonment"" -- the subject to which the ILA's newly discovered 
evidence relates. "
1380,10," The term ""freight forwarder"" means any person which (otherwise than as a carrier subject to chapters 1, 8, or 12 of this title) 
holds itself out to the general public as a common carrier to transport or provide transportation of property, or any class or 
classes of property, for compensation, in interstate commerce, and which, in the ordinary and usual course of its undertaking, 
(A) assembles and consolidates or provides for assembling and consolidating shipments of such property, and performs or 
provides for the performance of break-bulk and distributing operations with respect to such consolidated shipments, and (B) 
assumes responsibility for the transportation of such property from point of receipt to point of destination, and (C) utilizes, for the 
whole or any part of the transportation of such shipments, the services of a carrier or carriers subject to chapters 1, 8, or 12 of 
this title.  49 U.S.C. § 1002(a)(5)."
1380,11," 49 U.S.C. § 1010 provides, in pertinent part, (a)(1) No person shall engage in service subject to this chapter unless such person holds a permit, issued by the 
Commission, authorizing such service . . . (3)(c) The Commission shall issue a permit to any qualified applicant therefor, authorizing the whole or any part of the 
service covered by the application, if the Commission finds that the applicant is ready, able, and willing properly to perform 
the service proposed, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the permit, is or will be consistent with the 
public interest and the national transportation policy declared in this Act; . . . According to the defendants, Conex applied for authority to provide freight forwarding services, but its application was denied by 
the Interstate Commerce Commission in January of 1971. The Commission's denial was based on Conex's failure to establish 
that its proposed services would be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy. The Commission 
also indicated that Conex was engaged in services without the required ICC authority. Consolidated Express, Inc., Freight 
Forwarder Application, ICC Docket FF-384 (Jan. 19, 1971). Exhibit 6 to Benkhardt Affidavit. The record suggests that Twin Express never applied for an ICC license. "
1382,12," However, the Supreme Court has stated that, in choosing between two arguably applicable limitations statutes of the forum 
state there is no reason to reject the characterization that state law would impose unless the characterization is unreasonable or 
inconsistent with national labor policy. UAW v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., supra, at 706 (1966). Where the forum state itself has several limitations of statutes, the court has no option but to choose among them. However, 
choosing among limitations periods of several states according to the forum's choice of law principles introduces a host of 
unnecessary complexities. State choice of law rules for selection of an appropriate statute of limitations are explored in Heavner 
v. Uniroyal, Inc., 63 N.J. 130, 140-141, 305 A.2d 412 (1970), and Allen v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 555 F.2d 361 (3rd Cir. 
1977). Attempting to apply these rules where the cause of action is federal is like fitting a round peg in a square hole. The most 
sensible thing to do, if the case law would permit it, would be for the federal courts to develop federal statutes of limitations, as a 
matter of federal common law, to fill the void. "
1383,13," In Falsetti v. U.M.W., 355 F.2d 658 (3rd Cir. 1966), the court suggested, in dicta, that the equitable doctrine of laches could 
bar a § 301 claim. See also United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906 (5th Cir. 1973) (equitable doctrine of laches is 
applicable to suit under Civil Rights Act of 1964.) "
1387,14," This is of course the question addressed by the NLRB and determined adversely to the union in this case. The language of 
National Woodwork, however, suggests to me that the NLRB and Second Circuit were wrong: the jobs of the ILA members were 
threatened by the boycotted product and the union activities were not used as an Allen Bradley sword to influence labor relations 
of a different employer."
1387,15," Even Allen Bradley may be read more narrowly as simply holding that the non-statutory exemption is unavailable, but that the 
activity may still be beyond the scope of the antitrust laws. And certain language in Allen Bradley suggests that a union commits 
an antitrust violation only when it participates in a pre-existing employer conspiracy. "
1388,," Interestingly, the Allen Bradley court treated the situation as if the union had merely joined an already existing conspiracy of 
employers, while the facts of the case strongly suggest that the union had masterminded the plan. "

they would have been only too happy to negotiate seriously with Hecht once he had a franchise ring hollow, for they knew full 
well that Hecht could not get a franchise until he had access to the stadium. There was certainly no willingness to negotiate any 
arrangement conditioned on Hecht's getting the AFL franchise; this might well have been all Hecht needed to obtain it. If the 
Redskins were as sure as they now assert they were that Hecht and associates could never have obtained a franchise because 
of lack of financial resources and other reasons, the Redskins could have avoided this lawsuit by waiving their restrictive 
covenant and then watching the AFL turn down the Hecht application."

""competition between the leagues for franchise locations;"" since each league was considering expansion to a host of desirable 
sites, the court properly held that the market, geographically, was "" at least as broad as the United States, including Hawaii and 
portions of Canada."" 323 F.2d at 130. This case, by contrast, concerns the potential competition between two teams for 
customers in one location. Unlike the NFL, the Redskins as ""sellers"" do not operate nationally; unlike the AFL, Hecht is not trying 
to expand nationally. He sought merely to compete with the Redskins on their home turf."
1400,21," These customers would include potential season ticket holders and occasional ticket buyers, and, to a lesser extent, 
purchasers of local radio and pre-season television broadcasting rights. Most of a professional football team's broadcasting 
revenue, of course, derives from the national television contract, which is negotiated by the league. As testimony at trial 
indicated, however, individual teams have very little control over the revenue they derive from this contract, and thus the most 
important factor in considering location of a franchise is the potential ""gate"" in the home city. Tr. (4 Apr. 1975) at 31. For this 
reason, national television audiences and national television contract revenues should be ignored in ascertaining the relevant 
market here. Cf.  United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 361, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963) (holding

Terminal R.R., supra note 37. Hecht, however, did not request an instruction to this effect."

competition to be restricted to Washington, D.C. In view of our disposition of the relevant market issue, supra p. 990, this 
argument need not detain us further.  Second, defendants argue that, notwithstanding the essential facility doctrine, the jury 
could still have found the restrictive covenant reasonable. See pp. 995-96 infra. This argument robs the essential facility doctrine 
of any significance, and we reject it. The garden-variety restrictive covenant does not violate § 1 unless it unreasonably restrains 
trade; when the restrictive covenant covers an essential facility, however, all possible competition is by definition excluded and 
the restraint is thus unreasonable per se - provided, of course, that the facility can be shared practically. The requested 
instruction adequately accommodated this proviso."

amend his instruction: ""When you use the word disjunctive, I would like you to sort of explain that [it means] either one or the 
other must be injured."" Tr. 2684. The judge refused. Id. During its deliberations, the jury asked to hear the instruction on ""injury

the jury had to find an injury to property if Hecht were to have standing. See Tr. 2856. The record suggests no reason for the trial

alleged to be a ""competitor"" of Star Lines."
1417,5, The parties dispute whether the charter to PFEL was made before or after February 17.
1417,6," This last count was first asserted by plaintiff in its amended complaint, filed in August."

] ""The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or 
if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought."" "
1418,8," More precisely, Star Lines alleges that cargo is regularly picked up from New York City shippers, and that the containers and 
trailers which pick up the goods are owned by PRMSA itself, and are registered in New York.  PRMSA has twice specifically 
addressed this contention.  In its reply brief, PRMSA contends that all of the containers and trailers that it owns are licensed in 
New Jersey, not in New York.  At oral argument, PRMSA asserted that it owned no trucks at all, but that all the trucks were 
owned by PRMMI.  It will be assumed for purposes of this motion that all the vehicles involved are owned by PRMMI and 
licensed in New Jersey.  However, we view PRMSA's statements regarding the ownership and licensing of the vehicles 
discussed by Star Lines, and the failure to deny Star Lines' assertion that the vehicles regularly pick up goods in New York City 
despite the fact that PRMSA twice ""corrected"" other details of Star Lines' assertion, as an admission that the gist of the claim is 
true."
1418,9," While neither party had indicated what volume of PRMSA/PRMMI's business is attributable to New York shippers, there is 
sufficient reason to believe that the New York business is substantial enough to satisfy the requirements of § 22. The 
substantiality of the business done is to be judged from the viewpoint of the average businessman, and not the corporate giant.  
Fashion Two Twenty, Inc. v. Steinberg, 339 F. Supp. 836, 841 (E.D.N.Y. 1971). See also United States v. Burlington Industries, "
1419,," Inc., 247 F. Supp. 185, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1965); J. & B. & S. Restaurant Corp., Inc. v. Henry's Drive-In, Inc., 353 F. Supp. 389, 392 
(W.D.N.Y. 1973). From this viewpoint, as little as $30,000 of sales is substantial ( Fashion Two Twenty, Inc. v. Steinberg, supra); 
so too, sales that constitute less than 2% of defendant's business is not insubstantial ( J. & B. & S. Restaurant Corp., Inc. v. 
Henry's Drive-In, Inc., supra). In short, the question is whether the amount of business in issue is so little as to be insignificant. I have no doubt that PRMMI's New York business is substantial for purposes of § 22.  PRMSA's business is shipping cargo 
between East Coast ports and the Caribbean.  Port Elizabeth, which services PRMSA's New York customers (see note 7, 
supra), is one of the major ports of call for PRMSA's ships. PRMMI's vehicles regularly make pick-ups in New York City.  See 
note 7, supra.  It is highly unlikely that the trade between New York and the Caribbean constitutes an insubstantial portion of 
PRMSA's business. In view of the virtual certainty that PRMSA's New York business is substantial, and in view of the fact that venue is based not 
only on the shipments from New York but also on the existence and activities of PRMMI's New York office (discussed supra), it 
would serve no useful purpose to require discovery before deciding this motion so that Star Lines could establish the exact 
amount of the New York trade."
1419,10," PRMSA correctly points out that, unlike § 15, § 22 does not expressly indicate that venue may be based on the in-district 
activities of a corporation's agent.  However, there is no reason to read this difference in language as requiring a court to ignore 
the activities of agents when venue is at issue under § 22. Indeed, such an interpretation would vitiate the very purpose of § 22. I 
decline to read § 22 as being narrower in this regard than the statute it was designed to enlarge upon. "
1420,11," Plaintiff's counsel has recently brought to the court's attention an affidavit of a former Executive Director of PRMSA that was 
submitted in another case in this district.  Sworn to on March 19, 1976, the affidavit states in part that ""PRMSA's ships are 
frequently present in the Port of New York . . . PRMSA continually does business in New York and, since such business is 
necessary to serve the Commonwealth, will continue to do such business indefinitely."" In light of the determination that PRMSA 
is transacting business here through the activities of PRMMI, it is unnecessary to explore the issues raised by this affidavit, or to 
determine what weight to give it in the face of the contrary position taken by PRMSA in this litigation."
1420,12,"  HN5[
] ""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil 
action to any other district or division where it might have been brought."""
1420,13," In addition to persons who are presently employees, PRMSA asserts that the testimony of two of its former executives will be 
crucial to its case.  As non-parties residing in Puerto Rico, these witnesses are beyond the subpoena power of this court.  
However, there is no reason to believe that PRMSA cannot procure the voluntary attendance of its former Executive Director 
and its former General Counsel. "

intended only to reach conspiracies affecting goods imported into this country.  Post, at 323-324.  But the scope of congressional 
power over foreign commerce has never been so limited, and it is established that the antitrust laws apply to exports as well.  
See, e.g., Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 599; United States v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 92 F. 
Supp. 947 (Mass.)."
1431,12," Moreover, in the Webb-Pomerene Act, ch. 50, 40 Stat. 516, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  § 61 et seq., Congress has provided a 
narrow and carefully limited exception for export activity that would otherwise violate the antitrust laws. See United States v. 
Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199. A judicial rule excluding all non-Americans as plaintiffs in treble-damages 
cases would hardly be consistent with the precisely limited exception Congress has established to the general applicability of the 
antitrust laws to foreign commerce."
1431,13," See n. 2, supra. "
1432,14," It has been suggested that depriving foreign plaintiffs of a treble-damages remedy and thus encouraging illegal conspiracies 
would affect American consumers in other ways as well: by raising worldwide prices and thus contributing to American inflation; 
by discouraging foreign entrants who might undercut monopoly prices in this country; and by allowing violators to accumulate a 
""war chest"" of monopoly profits to police domestic cartels and defend them from legal attacks.  Velvel, Antitrust Suits by Foreign 
Nations, 25 Cath. U.L. Rev. 1, 7-8 (1975)."
1432,15," The case relied on by petitioners as establishing a general rule, United States v. Fox, 94 U.S. 315, merely adopted New York's 
construction of its Statute of Wills, as a matter of state law.  Id., at 320. Even in New York the word ""person"" did not have a 
settled meaning.  Compare In re Will of Fox, 52 N. Y. 530, aff'd sub nom.  United States v. Fox, supra, with Republic of 
Honduras v. Soto, 112 N. Y. 310, 19 N.E. 845. In fact, contemporaneous cases generally held that the sovereign was entitled to 
have the benefit of a statute extending a right to ""persons."" See, e.g., Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U.S. 508, 514-517; Dollar 
Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239; Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229, 231. Cases construing federal statutes of the same era also indicate that the use of the term ""person"" did not invariably imply an 
intent to exclude governmental bodies.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360 (""person"" in §§ 3140 and 3244 of the Revised 
Statutes of 1878 includes a State); California v. United States, 320 U.S. 577, 585-586 (""person"" in the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 
U.S.C.  § 801 et seq., includes both a State and a city); Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 396 
(""person"" in the Sherman Act includes a city)."
1432,16," Even earlier, in Chattanooga Foundry, supra, at 396, the Court held without extended discussion that a city was entitled to sue 
for treble damages."
1432,17," In 1955 Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the United States to sue for single damages when it is injured in its 
business or property.  Ch. 283, § 1, 69 Stat. 282, 15 U.S.C.  § 15a. "
1433,18," While THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent says there are ""weapons in the arsenals of foreign nations"" sufficient to enable them to 
counter anticompetitive conduct, such as cartels or boycotts, post, at 327-328, such a political remedy is hardly available to a 
foreign nation faced with monopolistic control of the supply of medicines needed for the health and safety of its people."
1433,19," Congress has explicitly conferred jurisdiction upon the federal courts to entertain such suits: ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of 
$10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between -- . . . . . ""(4) a foreign state… as plaintiff and citizens of a State or of different States."" 28 U.S.C.  § 1332(a)(4) (1976 ed.). Among the actions foreign sovereign governments were entitled to maintain at the time of the passage of the Sherman and 
Clayton Acts were suits for common-law business torts, such as unfair competition, similar in general nature to antitrust claims.  
See French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., 191 U.S. 427 (1903); La Republique Francaise v. Schultz, 94 F. 500 (SDNY 
1899). "
1434,20," In a letter that was presented to the Court of Appeals when it reconsidered this case en banc, the Legal Adviser of the 
Department of State advised ""that the Department of State would not anticipate any foreign policy problems if… foreign 
governments [were held to be] 'persons' within the meaning of Clayton Act § 4."" A copy of this letter is contained in the 
Memorandum for the United States as Amicus Curiae in opposition to the petition for a writ of certiorari filed in this Court."
1434,21," Cf. n. 1, supra. "
1435,1," The Webb-Pomerene Act exempts certain actions of export associations from the antitrust laws, but the exemption applies only 
if the association's actions do not restrain trade or affect the price of exported products within the United States and do not 
restrain the export trade of any domestic competitor of the association.  15 U.S.C.  § 62. Although the Act was subsequently "
1436,," regarded as carving out an exemption from the antitrust laws, the legislative history indicates considerable question at the time 
whether the conduct of exporters meeting the conditions specified in the Act would have violated the antitrust laws even without 
the putative exemption.  See H.R. Rep. No. 50, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1917)."
1436,2, The equivalent language of subsequent drafts can be found at 21 Cong. Rec. 2598-2600 (1890). 
1438,3," The Court adverts to a letter from the Legal Adviser of the State Department to the Court of Appeals advising that no foreign 
policy problems were anticipated from a decision holding foreign governments to be persons within the meaning of § 4 of the
