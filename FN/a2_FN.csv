26,1," Plaintiffs also assert a civil rights claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming certain portions of the Illinois Supreme Court 
decisions violated procedural and substantive due process.  The Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this claim.  Rooker v. 
Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149 (1923); Louis Ender Inc. v. General Foods Corp., 467 F.2d 327 
(2nd Cir. 1972); Sarelas v. Sheehan, 326 F.2d 490 (7th Cir. 1963). As explained in Adkins v. Underwood, 370 F. Supp. 510, 
514-15 (N.D. Ill. 1974): ""While HN1[
] lower federal courts were given certain power in the Judiciary Act of 1789, they were not given any power 
to directly review cases from state courts, and they have not been given such power since that time . . . .  Only the 
Supreme Court is authorized to review on direct appeal the decision of state courts.  From the beginning this country has 
had two essentially separate legal systems.  Each system, federal and state, proceeds independently of the other with 
ultimate review in the United States Supreme Court of federal questions raised in either system. ""Even HN2[
] if a state court decision is constitutionally wrong, that does not make the judgment void, it merely leaves it 
open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding.  Unless and until so reversed or 
modified, it would be an effective and conclusive adjudication.  Under the legislation of Congress, no court of the United 
States other than the United States Supreme Court can entertain a proceeding to reverse or modify a state court judgment 
which is in error."""
26,2," The motion for preliminary injunction only sought relief for Mr. Stoner and Stoner Investments, not Lektro-Vend Corporation.  It 
is clear, however, that the hearing litigated the interests of all three plaintiffs and that Vendo acquiesced in this procedure.  
Plaintiffs' motion to amend the motion to include Lektro-Vend is therefore granted. "
27,3," Federal Trade Commission approval was required before Vendo could purchase the Stoner vending machine interests.  
Apparently this was accomplished by misrepresenting to the Commission that Stoner Manufacturing and Vendo were not actual 
or potential competitors. The record demonstrates that at the least Vendo was a potential competitor of Stoner Manufacturing. "
28,4," The final Illinois Supreme Court opinion makes such a review imperative.  The Illinois court expressly refused to consider the 
allegations that the state proceedings were part of an anticompetitive scheme.  Plaintiffs, having never had a trial on this issue, 
must be heard in the only forum now available. "
32,5," The findings contained herein are interlocutory in nature necessarily based on an incomplete record.  Of course, a complete 
trial specifically directed to the issues in this case might produce evidence requiring a different or more limited result. "

Smith for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States; by Vincent J. Apruzzese, Francis A. Mastro, and William L. Keller for "

Norton J. Come, and Linda Sher for the National Labor Relations Board, and by J. Albert Woll, Laurence Gold, and Thomas E. 
Harris for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. "
44,1," The primary effect of the agreement seems to have been to inhibit the union from offering any other employer a more favorable 
contract. When asked at trial whether another subcontractor could get an agreement on any different terms, Local 100's 
business agent answered: ""No. The agreement says that no one will be given a more favorable agreement. I couldn't, if I desired, as an agent, sign an 
agreement other than the ones in existence between the local contractors and the Local 100. .  .  .  .  . ""Q. I see. So that's - in other words, once you sign that contract with the Mechanical Contractors' Association, that sets the only 
type of agreement which your Union can enter into with any other mechanical contractors; is that correct, sir? ""A. That is true."" Tr. 45-46. "
45,2," There was no evidence that Local 100's organizing campaign was connected with any agreement with members of the 
multiemployer bargaining unit, and the only evidence of agreement among those subcontractors was the ""most favored nation"" 
clause in the collective-bargaining agreement. In fact, Connell has not argued the case on a theory of conspiracy between the 
union and unionized subcontractors. It has simply relied on the multiemployer agreement as a factor enhancing the restraint of 
trade implicit in the subcontracting agreement it signed."

Various bills introduced in both Houses included such provisions, see 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1912-1915, but neither the bill that 
passed the Senate nor the one that passed the House contained a Denver Building Trades provision. The Conference

construction-industry exemption from § 8 (e). 105 Cong. Rec. 17333 (1959) (proposed Senate resolution), 2 Leg. Hist. of

the Committee may have intended the § 8 (e) proviso simply to preserve the status quo under Carpenters' v. NLRB (Sand Door),

47,10," Local 100 contends, unsoundly we think, that the NLRB has decided this issue in its favor.  It cites Los Angeles Building & 
Construction Trades Council (B & J Investment Co.), 214 N.L.R.B. No. 86, 87 L.R.R.M. 1424 (1974), and a memorandum from 
the General Counsel explaining his decision not to file unfair labor practice charges in a similar case, Plumbers Local 100 
(Hagler Construction Co.), No. 16-CC-447 (May 1, 1974).  In B & J Investment the Board approved, without comment, an 
administrative law judge's conclusion that the § 8 (e) proviso authorized a subcontracting agreement between the Council and a 
general contractor who used none of his own employees in the particular construction project. The agreement in question may 
have been a prehire contract under § 8 (f), and it is not clear that the contractor argued that it was invalid for lack of a collective-
bargaining relationship. The General Counsel's memorandum in Hagler Construction is plainly addressed to a different argument 
- that a subcontracting clause should be allowed only if there is a pre-existing collective-bargaining relationship with the general 
contractor or if the general contractor has employees who perform the kind of work covered by the agreement. "

(remarks by Rep. Barden); 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1289, 1715. The NLRB has taken this view.  Operating Engineers Local 542, 
142 N.L.R.B. 1132 (1963), enforced, 331 F. 2d 99 (CA3), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 889 (1964)."
48,13," As noted above, supra, at 628-630, the garment-industry proviso reflects different considerations. The text of the proviso and 
the treatment in congressional debates and reports suggest that Congress intended to authorize garment workers' unions to 
continue using subcontracting agreements as an organizational weapon.  See Danielson v. Joint Board, 494 F. 2d 1230 (CA2 
1974) (Friendly, J.)."
48,14," Connell also has argued that the subcontracting agreement was subject to antitrust sanctions because the construction-
industry proviso authorizes only voluntary agreements. The foundation of this argument is a contention that § 8(b)(4)(B) forbids 
picketing to secure an otherwise lawful ""hot cargo"" agreement in the construction industry. Because we hold that the agreement 
in this case is outside the § 8(e) proviso, it is unnecessary to consider this alternative contention."
48,15," See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., (House Managers' statement), 65-67 (1947); 93 Cong. Rec. 4757, 4770, 
4834-4874 (1947) (debates over Sen. Ball's proposal for antitrust sanctions and Sen. Taft's compromise proposal for actual 
damages, which became § 303 of the NLRA). "
49,16," The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART argues that § 303 provides the exclusive remedy for violations of § 8(e), 
thereby precluding recourse to antitrust remedies. For that proposition the dissenting opinion relies upon ""considerable evidence 
in the legislative materials."" Post, at 650.  In our view, these materials are unpersuasive. In the first place, Congress did not 
amend § 303 expressly to provide a remedy for violations of § 8(e). See Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 
1959, §§ 704(d), (e), 73 Stat. 544-545. The House in 1959 did reject proposals by Representatives Hiestand, Alger, and 
Hoffman to repeal labor's antitrust immunity. Post, at 650-654. Those proposals, however, were much broader than the issue in 
this case. The Hiestand-Alger proposal would have repealed antitrust immunity for any action in concert by two or more labor 
organizations. The Hoffman proposal apparently intended to repeal labor's antitrust immunity entirely. That the Congress 
rejected these extravagant proposals hardly furnishes proof that it intended to extend labor's antitrust immunity to include 
agreements with nonlabor parties, or that it thought antitrust liability under the existing statutes would be inconsistent with the 
NLRA. The bill introduced by Senator McClellan two years later provides even less support for that proposition. Like most bills 
introduced in Congress, it never reached a vote."
49,17," In most cases a decision that state law is pre-empted leaves the parties with recourse only to the federal labor law, as 
enforced by the NLRB.  See Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274 (1971); San Diego Building Trades Council v. 
Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959). But in cases like this one, where there is an independent federal remedy that is consistent with 
the NLRA, the parties may have a choice of federal remedies. Cf.  Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 176-188 (1967); Smith v. 
Evening News Assn., 371 U.S. 195 (1962)."
49,18," Texas law is a good example. Texas Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Arts. 5152 and 5153 (1971), declare that it is lawful for workers to 
associate in unions and to induce other persons to accept or reject employment. Article 5154, however, referring to the 
preceding articles, provides: ""Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal, affect or diminish the force and effect of any statute 
now existing on the subject of trusts, conspiracies against trade, pools and monopolies."" The Texas antitrust statutes prohibit, 
among other specified agreements, trusts, and monopolies, any combination of two or more persons to restrict ""the free pursuit 
of a lawful business."" Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 15.02-15.04 (1968). "
50,19," In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment that the agreement with Local 100 violated the antitrust laws, Connell sought a 
permanent injunction against further picketing to coerce execution of the contract in litigation. Connell obtained a temporary 
restraining order against the picketing on January 21, 1971, and thereafter executed the contract - under protest - with Local 100 
on March 28, 1971. So far as the record in this case reveals, there has been no further picketing at Connell's construction sites. 
Accordingly, there is no occasion for us to consider whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids such an injunction where the 
specific agreement sought by the union is illegal, or to determine whether, within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, there 
was a ""labor dispute"" between these parties. If the Norris-LaGuardia Act were applicable to this picketing, injunctive relief would 
not be available under the antitrust laws. See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219 (1941). If the agreement in question is 
held on remand to be invalid under federal antitrust laws, we cannot anticipate that Local 100 will resume picketing to obtain or 
enforce an illegal agreement. "
51,1," Before 1932 this Court had held that secondary strikes and boycotts were not exempt from the coverage of the antitrust laws. 
E.g., Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stone Cutters' Assn., 274 U.S. 
37. Duplex and its progeny were overruled by Congress with passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70.  See Milk Wagon 
Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., 311 U.S. 91, 100-103; United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 229-231, 
235-237. "
52,2," The Act added § 8(b)(4) to the National Labor Relations Act, making it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its 
agents ""to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in 
the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, 
materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-
employed person to join any labor or employer organization or any employer or other person to cease using, selling, handling, 
transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business 
with any other person…."" 61 Stat. 141. "
53,3," The amendment introduced by Senator Ball provided in part that the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act ""shall not be 
applicable in respect of violations of subsection (a) [defining prohibited secondary conduct], or in respect of any contract, 
combination, or conspiracy, in restraint of commerce, to which a labor organization is a party, if one of the purposes of such 
contract, combination, or conspiracy is to fix prices, allocate customers, restrict production, distribution, or competition, or 
impose restrictions or conditions upon the purchase, sale or use of any material, machines, or equipment."" 93 Cong. Rec. 4757 
(1947)."
53,4," Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 158-159, provided: ""(a) It shall be unlawful, for the purposes of this section only, in an industry or activity affecting commerce, for any labor 
organization to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal 
in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, 
materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is - ""(1) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or any employer or 
other person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, 
processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person; .  .  .  .  . "
54,," ""(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason [o]f any violation of subsection (a) may sue therefor in any

54,5," Section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 
1959, 73 Stat. 519, 542-543, now provides in part that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents: ""(4)(i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry 
affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, 
or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to threaten, 
coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object 
thereof is - ""(A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or to enter into any 
agreement which is prohibited by subsection (e) of this section…."" 29 U.S.C. § 158 (b)(4)."
54,6," Section 303, as amended by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 519, 545, now provides: ""(a) It shall be unlawful, for the purpose of this section only, in an industry or activity affecting commerce, for any labor 
organization to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section 158(b)(4) of this title. ""(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason [o]f any violation of subsection (a) of this section may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States subject to the limitations and provisions of section 185 of this title without 
respect to the amount in controversy, or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties, and shall recover the damages by 
him sustained and the cost of the suit."" 29 U.S.C.  § 187."
54,7," Indeed, Connell's original state-court complaint was filed before Connell had signed any agreement with Local 100. See ante, 
at 620. At that point it was apparent that the primary reason for the lawsuit was Connell's request for an injunction to stop the 
union's picketing. "
55,8," If, contrary to the Court's conclusion, see ante, at 626-633, Congress intended what it said in the proviso to § 8(e), then the 
subcontracting agreement is valid and, under the view of the Board and those Courts of Appeals that have considered the 
question, Local 100's picketing to obtain the agreement would also be lawful. See, e.g., Orange Belt District Council of Painters 
v. NLRB, 117 U.S. App. D.C. 233, 236, 328 F. 2d 534, 537; Construction Laborers v. NLRB, 323 F. 2d 422 (CA9); Northeastern 
Indiana Bldg. Trades Council, 148 N.L.R.B. 854, enforcement denied on other grounds, 122 U.S. App. D.C. 220, 352 F. 2d 696. 
Connell would therefore have neither a remedy under § 303 nor one with the Board. It would seem necessarily to follow that conduct specifically authorized by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act could 
not by itself be the basis for federal antitrust liability, unless the Court intends to return to the era when the judiciary frustrated 
congressional design by determining for itself ""what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands."" Duplex Printing 
Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219. In my view, 
however, even if Local 100's conduct was unlawful, Connell may not seek to invoke the sanctions of the antitrust laws. 
Accordingly, I find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether the subcontracting agreement entered into by Connell and Local 
100 is within the ambit of the construction-industry proviso to § 8(e), and if it is, whether it was permissible for Local 100 to utilize 
peaceful picketing to induce Connell to sign the agreement."
55,9," If Connell and Local 100 had entered into a purely voluntary ""hot cargo"" agreement in violation of § 8(e), an injured nonunion 
mechanical subcontractor would have no § 303 remedy because the union would not have engaged in any § 8(b)(4) unfair labor 
practice. The subcontractor, however, would still be able to seek the full range of Board remedies available for a § 8(e) unfair 
labor practice. Moreover, if Connell had truly agreed to limit its subcontracting without any coercion whatsoever on the part of 
Local 100, the affected subcontractor might well have a valid antitrust claim on the ground that Local 100 and Connell were 
engaged in the type of conspiracy aimed at third parties with which this Court dealt in Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 
325 U.S. 797. At the very least, an antitrust suit by an injured subcontractor under circumstances in which Congress had failed 
to provide any form of private remedy for damage resulting from an illegal ""hot cargo"" agreement would present a very different 
question from the one before us - a question which it is not now necessary to answer.  Cf.  Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 
U.S. 676, 708 n. 9 (opinion of Goldberg, J.). On the other hand, the signatory of a purely voluntary agreement that violates § 8(e) is fully protected from any damage that 
might result from the illegal ""hot cargo"" agreement by his ability simply to ignore the contract provision that violates § 8(e). If the 
union should attempt to enforce the illicit ""hot cargo"" clause through any form of coercion, the employer may then bring a § 303 
damages suit or may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. See 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(B). Since § 8(e) provides that 
any prohibited agreement is ""unenforcible and void,"" any union effort to invoke legal processes to compel the neutral employer 
to comply with his purely voluntary agreement would obviously be unavailing. "
56,10," The legislative proceedings leading to the passage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (the 
Landrum-Griffin Act), 73 Stat. 519, began in January 1959 when Senator John Kennedy introduced S. 505, 86th Cong., 1st 
Sess. In March 1959 Senator Kennedy introduced S. 1555, incorporating 46 amendments to S. 505 made by the Committee on 
Labor and Public Welfare. S. 1555, with various additional amendments, was approved by the Senate on April 25, 1959, and 
sent to the House, where it was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. On July 30, 1959, the House Committee 
favorably reported H.R. 8342, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. One week earlier H.R. 8400 and H.R. 8401, identical bills, were introduced 
in the House by Representatives Landrum and Griffin, respectively. The House voted on August 13, 1959, to substitute the text 
of H.R. 8400 for the text of the House Committee bill, and the Landrum-Griffin bill was then inserted by the House in S. 1555 in 
lieu of its provisions. The Conference made several substantive changes in the Landrum-Griffin bill, which was then passed by 
both the House and Senate and approved by the President. See generally 1 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA vii-xi. "
57,11," Representative Hiestand, during House debate on the report of the Conference Committee, recommended adoption of the bill 
as amended by the Conference and complimented Representatives Landrum and Griffin for their efforts in guiding the bill 
through Congress. But in expressing concern over the fact that the legislation did not restore antitrust sanctions for union 
secondary activity and other anticompetitive restraints of trade, he warned: ""[W]e should act today with full knowledge that 
passage of the Landrum-Griffin bill will not solve every problem. The heart of the problem, the very heart, is the sheer power in 
the hands of labor union leaders due to their above-the-law status with respect to our antimonopoly laws."" 105 Cong. Rec. 
18132; 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1719."
57,12," Section 2 (b)(2) of Senator McClellan's bill, S. 2573, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., provided that the Sherman Act be amended to 
read in part: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, every contract, agreement, or understanding, express or implied, between any labor 
organization and any employer engaged in the transportation of persons or property, whereby such employer undertakes to 
cease, or to refrain from, purchasing, using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in any of the products or 
services of any producer, processor, distributor, supplier, handler, or manufacturer which are distributed in trade or commerce in 
any territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, or between any such territory and another, or between any such

71,7," The FDIC noted that the independent Tucker Bank had not been in unsound financial condition when C&S assumed de facto

trade and commerce: ""1. The routine and systematic practice of furnishing to one another comprehensive information as to past, present and future 
competitive practices and policies with a purpose of achieving uniformity among the defendants; ""2. The provision by C&S National to the five percent defendants of various manuals and memoranda; "
72,," ""3. The provision by C&S National to the five percent defendants of suggestions and advice on such matters as rates, hours of 
operation, types of loan to discourage and minimum loan rates…. ""The Government also asserts, and the record shows, that the advice and suggestions offered by C&S National are generally 
followed. ""These activities, however, do not amount to collusive price fixing. For example, there is no suggestion that any advice as to 
rates amounts to more than an expert appraisal of a market situation from the point of view of a lending institution -- a type of 
opinion to which a lending institution would naturally be expected to pay great attention…. ""The practices involved here do not conform to the accepted definition or description of per se antitrust violations where no resort 
to context or circumstances is required (or permitted). .  .  .  .  . ""There is no evidence of record to conclude that the utilization by the five percent defendant banks of the services or information 
received by them from C&S National or C&S Holding was a result of any tacit or explicit combinations rather than the natural 
deference of the recipient to information from one with greater expertise or better sources. In either case there is the flow of 
information as to rates, practices, etc., which the Government apparently applauds or at least condones in a correspondent 
banking relationship."" 372 F. Supp., at 626, 627, and 628."

any adverse economic or competitive implications whatever…."" 372 F. Supp., at 638. Competitors of the suburban 5-percent 
banks ""expressed the view that the proposed mergers would have no effect whatsoever on competition as it relates to third 
parties."" Ibid. The court found ""as a fact that there is no presently existing substantial competition between the five percent 
defendant banks and C&S National, or inter sese, or with third parties, which would be affected by the proposed merger."" Id., at

73,," In the interval between the trial and the announcement of the District Court's opinion, the Supreme Court of Georgia had ruled in 
a separate suit brought by a group of independent suburban banks that C&S was in technical violation of the state bank holding 
company law with respect to the 5-percent banks in the Atlanta suburbs. Its judgment was grounded on the fact that, in addition 
to the 5-percent stock interest directly owned by C&S Holding, substantial numbers of shares were owned by C&S officers and 
directors. The state court accordingly directed the Georgia Banking Commissioner to file suit to force divestiture of excess stock 
holdings by these shareholders.  Independent Bankers Assn. v. Dunn, 230 Ga. 345, 197 S.E. 2d 129, modified sub nom.  
Citizens & Southern National Bank v. Independent Bankers Assn., 231 Ga. 421, 202 S.E. 2d 78. The District Court's opinion took 
notice of this state-court judgment and concluded that it would not lead to genuine competition among the 5-percent banks or 
between them and C&S.  372 F. Supp., at 643. After the District Court's opinion was announced, the state Banking 
Commissioner, acting pursuant to the state-court judgment, ordered C&S Holding to limit its direct and indirect interest in the 
stock of correspondent associate banks to 5 percent and ordered C&S to ""terminate any direct or indirect supervision of the… 
five percent banks beyond that which is available from The Citizens and Southern National Bank or the Citizens and Southern 
Holding Company to any bank that wishes to enter into a correspondent relationship with such bank or holding company."" On 
June 3, 1974, the District Court amended its opinion nunc pro tunc to find that the Banking Commissione's ""order does not 
change the underlying basis of the Court's decision that the proposed mergers will not substantially lessen competition."" Id., at

interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served."" Hence,

74,15," Prior to the amendments of July 1, 1966, Pub. L. 89-485, § 7, 80 Stat. 237, prior approval of the Board was not required for 
causing a bank to become a subsidiary of a bank holding company. In addition to adding this requirement, the 1966 
amendments broadened the definition of a subsidiary from a company in which a bank holding company ""own[s]"" 25 percent of 
the voting shares to a company in which a bank holding company ""directly or indirectly own[s] or control[s]"" this percentage 
share. Compare § 4 of the 1966 amendments, 80 Stat. 236, with § 2 (d) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 133. 
The provision is now codified at 12 U.S.C.  § 1841 (d)(1). The definition of subsidiary has also included, from the outset of the 
Act, ""any company the election of a majority of whose directors is controlled in any manner"" by a bank holding company.  12 "

definition of subsidiary to include ""any company with respect to the management or policies of which such bank holding 
company has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence, as determined by the Board, after notice and 
opportunity for hearing."" 12 U.S.C.  § 1841 (d)(3)."

subsection headings omitted) reads: ""(a) Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted or construed as approving any act, action, or conduct which is or has been or 
may be in violation of existing law, nor shall anything herein contained constitute a defense to any action, suit, or proceeding 
pending or hereafter instituted on account of any prohibited antitrust or monopolistic act, action, or conduct, except as 
specifically provided in this section. ""(b) The Board shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval by it pursuant to section 1842 of this title of a 
proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction, and such transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth 
calendar day after the date of approval by the Board. Any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of an acquisition, 
merger, or consolidation transaction approved under section 1842 of this title shall be commenced within such thirty-day period. 
The commencement of such an action shall stay the effectiveness of the Board's approval unless the court shall otherwise 
specifically order. In any such action, the court shall review de novo the issues presented. In any judicial proceeding attacking 
any acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved pursuant to section 1842 of this title on the ground that such 
transaction alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of Title 15, the standards applied 
by the court shall be identical with those that the Board is directed to apply under section 1842 of this title. Upon the 
consummation of an acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved under section 1842 of this title in compliance 
with this chapter and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this section, or 
upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in 
any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of 
Title 15, but nothing in this chapter shall exempt any bank holding company involved in such a transaction from complying with 
the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction. ""(c) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of any acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction approved by 
the Board under section 1842 of this title, the Board and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the 
State involved, may appear as a party of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel. ""(d) Any acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described in section 1842 (a) of this title which was consummated at 
any time prior or subsequent to May 9, 1956, and as to which no litigation was initiated by the Attorney General prior to July 1, 
1966, shall be conclusively presumed not to have been in violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of Title 15. ""(e) Any court having pending before it on or after July 1, 1966, any litigation initiated under the antitrust laws by the Attorney 
General with respect to any acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described in section 1842 (a) of this title shall apply

October 15, 1914 (the Clayton Act), and any other Acts in pari materia."" "
76,17," The Secretary to the Federal Reserve Board described the investigation and the 1968 ""understanding"" in a 1972 letter to the 
Justice Department: ""The fact finding inquiry undertaken by Board staff into the relationship between Citizens & Southern and the other banking 
institutions referred to was begun in 1966 and continued into 1968. The principal focus of the inquiry concerned essentially two 
questions: (1) whether Citizens & Southern had unlawfully acquired a direct or indirect stock ownership in these banking 
institutions in excess of 5 per cent without first having secured the requisite prior Board approval; and (2) whether the banking 
institutions had unlawfully become subsidiaries of Citizens & Southern by virtue of the election of directors without first having 
received the requisite prior Board approval. The inquiry arose in 1966 out of information contained in Citizens & Southern's 
registration statement filed with the Board and in 1968 as a result of information supplied by the Comptroller of the Currency in 
connection with the merger of the Citizens and Southern National Bank and the Citizens and Southern Bank of Augusta. The 
inquiry referred to was not initiated as a result of any application filed with the Board for approval of an acquisition, merger, or 
consolidation transaction under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act. .  .  .  . ""The Board of Governors did not issue any order approving the relationships between Citizens & Southern and the other banking 
institutions under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act. .  .  .  . ""There was no determination made that approval of the Board under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act was required 
for Citizens & Southern to retain an ownership interest of 5 per cent or less in the banking institutions referred to or to maintain 
the relationships with those banks in circumstances where Citizens & Southern did not elect a majority of the directors of any 
such bank. There was an understanding reached between members of the Board's staff and representatives of Citizens & 
Southern that in those cases where Citizens & Southern purchased 5 per cent or less of the stock of a bank, in some instances 
furnishing a principal operating officer for such bank, as well as other employee benefits, Citizens & Southern would not be 
deemed to have control of a majority of the directors of such bank on these facts alone. Further, where the foregoing 
circumstances existed and where control of additional shares was purchased by the bank's executive officer, control of such 
shares purchased would not be attributed to Citizens & Southern so long as Citizens & Southern did not finance the purchase of 
such shares, directly or indirectly. Finally, it was understood that even though Citizens & Southern was responsible, directly or 
indirectly, in placing one or two directors on the boards of such banks, if that number did not constitute a majority of directors of 
such bank, the Board's staff would not consider that Citizens & Southern could reasonably be held to have control of a majority 
of the directors of such bank."" "
77,18," See n. 15, supra."
77,19," LEdHN[6D][
] [6D]The grandfather provision creates a conclusive presumption of compliance with the antitrust laws, but not necessarily of compliance with the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. See 12 U.S.C.  § 1849 (f)."
77,20," If the correspondent associate program had received formal Board approval, any antitrust immunity created by the machinery 
in § 1849 (b) could, of course, have extended only to those features of the program clearly and expressly encompassed by the 
approval order. But § 1849 (d) applies even where, as here, there has been no approval order. If the provision were construed to 
cover only transactions actually violative of § 1842 (a), a court applying the provision would face the daunting -- and quite 
senseless -- task of dissecting a complicated, integrated transaction, such as the formation of a de facto branch, into those 
components which did and those which did not require prior approval of the Board. "
78,21," The Tucker Bank, which was not founded as a new bank by C&S, comes within the coverage of the grandfather provision, as 
explained in the previous section. De facto branching through the de facto ""acquisition"" of pre-existing banks might raise 
questions under the Sherman Act considerably different from those presented by the C&S practice of de facto branching through 
founding new banks."

Bancorporation, 418 U.S., at 628-629. But most of these barriers - e.g., chartering requirements - at least arguably serve the 
overriding public interest in maintaining customer confidence in the industry as a whole by assuring adequate financial stability 
and responsible management for all banks. Antibranching laws, on the other hand, are now widely recognized as a simple 
device to protect outlying unit banks from the rigors of regional competition. See Report, President's Commission on Financial

82,31, See Appendix to this opinion.
82,32," In the entire history of C&S's 5-percent program, only the Stone Mountain Bank terminated its relationship with C&S. The 
record shows that that bank was not sponsored by C&S, that a large amount of the stock remained in the hands of a family 
hostile to C&S, that the bank's shareholders never intended to merge with C&S, and that the bank's board of directors resisted 
introduction of C&S banking methods. None of these factors exists with respect to the banks at issue in the present case. It is true that C&S has recently been ordered by the State Banking Commissioner to trim back its percentage ownership of the 
suburban banks and to modify, in ways not yet fully clear, its ""supervision"" of those banks. See n. 11, supra. But the District 
Court considered this development and concluded that it would not lead to true competition among the defendant banks. The 
court explicitly found that the changes ordered would not affect the bonds of inter-bank consultation and cooperation which are 
at the heart of the correspondent associate program.  372 F. Supp., at 638, 643, and n. 8. "
85,1," These computations consider the 5-percent defendant banks as completely separate entities (rather than as constituting a part 
of the C&S system as actually is the case), and of course, do not relate to competition as such but rather to the assignment of 
statistical proportions to the various entities involved."
85,2," See n. 1, supra. "
88,1," Relationships labeled ""correspondent banking"" may call for careful scrutiny as the sale of specialized services by the 
corresponding bank shades into ""consultation"" by the correspondent on every business decision of significance. Correspondent 
banking, like other intra-industry interaction among firms or their top management, provides an opportunity both for the kind of 
education and sharing of expertise that ultimately enhances consumer welfare and for ""understandings"" that inhibit, if not 
foreclose, the rivalry that antitrust laws seek to promote. As one commentator on commercial banking practices has observed: ""[C]ommunication, especially when it comes from those at the top of a power hierarchy, tends to facilitate conflict resolution. 
Perhaps a great deal should not be made of this, but competition is a form of conflict and, in the present context, conflict 
resolution is a form of restraint on competition."" Phillips, Competition, Confusion, and Commercial Banking, 19 J. of Finance 32, 
42 (1964). Since the relationship of C&S to the 5-percent banks goes well beyond ordinary ""correspondent banking,"" this case does not 
present an occasion for further examination of the lawfulness of these more limited interconnections among firms."
88,2," The Consumer Credit Operating Bulletin, 7 App. E-1024 (DX-311), is illustrative. It explains what bank records should be 
established, the methods for arranging a repayment plan, and the procedures to be followed in perfecting a security interest. In 
addition, the manual sets forth C&S practice with respect to charges for late payments, extensions of repayment deadlines, and 
the notification of a borrower's employer about repayment delinquency. "

92,12," My conclusion that the affiliative relationships are not within the terms of § 3 (a), at least prior to the 1970 amendment, is 
further supported by the scope and outcome of the 1968 investigation of C&S undertaken by the Federal Reserve Board staff. 
The investigation was convened specifically to inquire into a possible violation of § 3. The staff was principally concerned with 
the pattern of ownership of the stock of the 5-percent banks, especially by C&S officers and employees. Ultimately the staff 
found this acceptable, so long as C&S did not finance the purchases. There is no indication, however, that the staff concerned 
itself with communications between C&S and the 5-percent banks with respect to such matters as interest rates, loan repayment 
policies, or other terms of business."
92,13," There is little doubt that pent-up consumer demand for additional banks would sooner or later induce efforts to organize new 
ones. More questionable, however, is whether regulatory authorities would respond promptly to permit new entry. In general, 
regulatory policy has been thought to retard formation of new banking institutions. See Peltzman, Entry in Commercial Banking, 
8 J. Law & Econ. 11 (1965). "
93,14," The record demonstrates that such a chain of events is possible. Citizens & Southern Bank of Stone Mountain, organized in 
1957 with C&S assistance, functioned as a correspondent associate from 1959 until 1970. At that time it declined an offer of 
acquisition by C&S and became independent of the C&S system. Appellees have argued that Stone Mountain represents a 
unique case because a majority of voting stock remained in the hands of a single family not intimately tied to the C&S system. 
This contention is not wholly supported by the record, since in his trial testimony Mr. Mills Lane, President of C&S from 1946 to 
1970, referred to three other banks having a similar structure of ownership. (2 App. 378-379, referring to Pelham, Fayetteville, 
Hogansville). The example of Stone Mountain does, in any event, demonstrate that sponsorship can occur under conditions 
ultimately leading to independence of the sponsored institution. "
94,15," The District Court made no finding as to the relevant geographic market, accepting the Government's contentions arguendo in 
deciding the case. The Court apparently does the same. A report prepared by the Government's expert witness concluded that 
while the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area was too large to be considered an integral geographic market, the 
constituent counties of DeKalb and Fulton were ""reasonable geographic areas within which it is appropriate to analyze the 
competitive effects of the proposed mergers."" 4 App. E-83. This is an approximation, of course, since the same report revealed 
that a number of DeKalb residents use Fulton County banks, thus suggesting that in certain respects DeKalb and Fulton County 
banks compete for the same business. Accordingly, it appears that defining the geographic market to include both DeKalb and 
Fulton Counties would be justified under our cases. See United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank & Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350 
(1970); United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321 (1963)."
94,16," Three of the 5-percent banks - Sandy Springs, Chamblee, and Tucker -- had deposits exceeding $15 million as of January 1, 
1970. North Fulton, Park National, and South DeKalb were smaller and more recently organized, but all have experienced "
95,," vigorous growth. The average annual rate of deposit growth for the two years preceding January 1, 1970, was 102% for North 
Fulton and 50% for Park National, in contrast to a national average rate for all commercial bank deposits during the same period 
of slightly more than 10%. South DeKalb, organized in late 1969, had more than doubled its deposits from $ 1.5 to $ 3 million 
during the first half of 1970. 5 App. E-422, E-546."
95,17," See n. 16, supra."
95,18," Officers of both C&S and the 5-percent banks testified that they had not contemplated a severance of relations, but this 
testimony does not establish what would happen if the acquisitions were enjoined. Had the managements testified that they 
would not consider severance under any circumstances, such declarations of an intention to eschew a course dictated by 
economic self-interest would have to be viewed with skepticism. See United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 568-
570 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., concurring in result). Whether the 5-percent banks would have been formed at all had their principals expected the Clayton Act to bar ultimate 
acquisition by C&S is a different question. I am not troubled by it for essentially the same reasons that have led me to conclude 
above that enjoining continuation of correspondent associate relationships would not deter sponsorship of de facto branches 
under state-law restrictions on de jure branching. See supra, at 143-144. "
96,19," The record indicates that at the time C&S applied for regulatory approval of the acquisitions, its two largest competitors, First 
National Bank of Atlanta and Trust Company of Georgia, had sought and in some cases had obtained, approval for similar 
acquisitions of affiliated banks. 1 App. E-39. "

American Antitrust Laws"", 80 Yale LJ 195, 292-293; 6A Corbin, Contracts, § 1412A).  We note, too, that administrative agency

Burns v City of New York, 213 NY 516, 524; Hoff v Royal Metal Furniture Co., 117 App Div 884, affd 189 NY 555); however, the 
renewal provision must be in precise language to permit such a construction, as these cases hold."
124,4," The Supreme Court of New Jersey explicitly stated that it did not reach the question of the equitable defense raised by the 
tenant claiming that Shell was guilty of price discrimination and tie-in practices.  For further developments with respect to the 
New Jersey franchising laws, see Mariniello v Shell Oil Co. (368 F Supp 1401). "

133,1," For convenience, we will refer to the appellants as the Bubble Up Corporation. "
134,2," Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola did not franchise the same bottlers. The two cola products directly compete at the consumer level. A 
bottler with a dual franchise might be hesitant to strongly promote one cola product over the other, with competitive detriment to 
both syrup manufacturers. To the extent that the lemon-lime segment of the soft drink market comprises a separate set of 
consumers, this conflict is lessened. Non-cola soft drinks and cola products are sufficiently competitive at the consumer level, 
however, to make dual franchises for Coca Cola and Seven Up relatively rare."
134,3," In the late 1950's, Seven Up began to increase its share of the total soft drink market, taking advantage of its ability to satisfy 
increased consumer demand for lemon-lime soft drinks."
134,4," By 1960 the lemon-lime segment of the soft drink market accounted for 10.5% of total soft drink sales. Seven Up made over 
80% of the total lemon-lime drink sales."
134,5," Evidence indicated that other drinks competed in this submarket as well, including citrus drinks (e.g., Squirt), and various 
ginger ales. However, those products were really minor competitive factors. Collectively these products comprised the ""green

136,9," The Sherman Act's statute of limitations apparently bars Bubble Up's Section 1 challenge to the Investment Market Program.  
HN4[
] 15 U.S.C. § 15b provides in pertinent part: ""Any action to enforce any cause of action under sections 15 and 15a of this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued."" The Coca Cola Company 
discontinued the IMP in October 1963, and Bubble Up did not file its complaint until January 2, 1968. Bubble Up seeks to avoid 
the statute of limitations bar by claiming that Coca Cola engaged in a continuing course of exclusionary conduct. We doubt the 
validity of that approach here. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 
(1971). However, we reach the merits of Bubble Up's challenge to the IMP because of its relevance to the intent issues in the 
Section 2 charge."
136,10," See Note, Advertising and Shared Monopoly in Consumer Goods, 9 Colum. J. Law & Soc. Prob. 241, 253-55 (1973)."
136,11," Bubble Up asserts that the bottler territories did not correspond to the television market areas because of vertical territorial 
restrictions. Therefore it claims the IMP is an illegal product of those restrictions. Yet Bubble Up did not specifically make this 
argument at the trial, nor did it request jury instructions on this theory. See Section II.A.2., infra. The trial evidence on the point is sketchy. Bottler territorial limitations are a function of factors like plant capacity, delivery truck 
range, available labor force, etc. The designated television marketing areas for advertising were a function of the power of the 
area TV transmitter. It seems doubtful that bottler territorial limitations had any impact on the advertising program for Sprite. 
Certainly the trial evidence on the point is not conclusive."
136,12, The price term of the standard Sprite franchise agreement read as follows: Price of Concentrate Price of Syrup Sprite per unit * 
137,, per gallon *
137,*," The above prices incude an advertising allowance of (1) five cents (5 cents) per gallon of syrup, or equivalent gallon of 
concentrate, which, however, can only be spent for point-of-sale material approved by Fanta Beverage Company and (2) an 
additional sum of twenty cents (20 cents) per gallon of syrup, or equivalent gallon of concentrate, purchased by BOTTLER under 
this agreement shall be spent, one-half (1/2) of said amount on advertising or promotions mutually agreed upon by BOTTLER 
and COMPANY, and one-half (1/2) of said amount in such manner and form as Fanta Beverage Company deems desirable. Additionally the contract obligated the bottler ""To vigorously promote the sale of the Beverage [Sprite] through the preparation or 
formulation of sales, advertising and promotional plans and to spend reasonable sums therefor."" Thus in performance of his 
obligation to vigorously promote Sprite through advertising, the franchisee could apply five cents of the purchase price of a 
gallon of Sprite syrup or concentrate equivalent to purchase point of sale advertising material. An additional twenty cents per 
gallon was spent for other advertising or promotions. Under the contract provision the bottler had partial control over the expenditure of one half of the twenty cent allowance. Trial 
testimony indicated however that in practice the Coca Cola Company exercised complete control over the entire contract 
advertising allowance during the existence of the IMP. Q Now, the advertising, of course, this is advertising that Coca-Cola spends to advertise the product? Coca-Cola doesn't give the money over to the bottler, right? A No. Testimony of Thomas C. Law, Record Vol. 22 at 119."
137,13," The IMP was not particularly successful in practice. The Coca Cola Company counted on the increase in Sprite gallon sales 
for the second and third years of the program to keep actual advertising expenditures relatively constant over the IMP's lifespan. 
As former Coca Cola executive Thomas C. Law explained, this did not occur. And it didn't work for a very good reason. . . . There wasn't enough advertising because, for example, let's say the bottler is going to do 10,000 gallons of syrup the first 
year. We were going to spend 60 cents a gallon. That would mean we would spend $6,000. The second year, we were only going to spend 40 cents a gallon. So, in order to spend the $6,000, the bottler would have 
to do 15,000 gallons, 15,000 times 40 cents is $6,000 again. So, again as much syrup. He would have to have a 50 percent 
increase in business in order to have $6,000 advertising. The third year we were only going to spend 20 cents. On the third year he had to do 30,000 gallons of syrup in order for us 
to spend $6,000. . . . Cost was going up. Cost of television advertising was getting higher. "
138,," So, we were faced with a situation where the bottler had to have a 50 percent increase the second year and had to double 
his business the third year in order for us to have the same amount of advertising dollar. Well, obviously, this didn't work, because he just didn't do that. The product didn't grow that fast, and the television cost 
went up, now [sic] down, and, as you did more business, you would need more advertising. So, as soon as we could we did away with investment market. We abandoned it. Record Vol. 16 at 22-24. Actually Mr. Law is incorrect about the increase necessary for the third year. A bottler would have to increase purchases to 
20,000 gallons rather than 30,000 to achieve the $6,000 figure. See text following n.12, supra."
138,14," Both Sherman Act § 1, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1970), and Clayton Act § 3, 15 U.S.C. § 14 (1970), prohibit tying arrangements. But § 3 
only applies where both the tying and the tied products are ""goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other 
commodities."" The standards of proof under the two sections differ. HN8[
] To establish an illegal tying arrangement under § 1, the antitrust plaintiff must show (1) sufficient economic power in the tying product to appreciably restrain competition in the tied 
product, and (2) that the tying arrangement affects a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce.  Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. 
United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). But under § 3, the plaintiff succeeds if he establishes either 
of the above elements. Id. See also Advance Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55 (4th Cir. 1969), cert.

138,15," Given the economics of television advertising, an individual Sprite bottler could not economically conduct a television 
advertising program in his bottling territory. Television advertising has significant economies of scale, and large national 
advertisers can obtain the most favorable time slots, and get quantity discounts on advertising purchases. Note, Advertising and 
Shared Monopoly in Consumer Goods, 9 Colum. J. Law & Soc. Prob. 241, 254-55 (1973)."
138,16," Cf. Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955, 92 S. Ct. 1172, 31 L. Ed. 2d 232

and spices); Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. dism'd, 381 U.S. 125, 85 S. Ct. 1364, 14 L. Ed. 2d 284 
(1968) (franchisee required to purchase all store equipment and supplies from franchisor). Coca Cola Company advertising 
purchases actually defrayed business expenses that the bottler might otherwise have incurred to effectively market Sprite in his 
area of operations. "
139,," Our disposition of Bubble Up's tying arrangement claim obviates any consideration of Coca Cola's contention that Sprite syrup 
and Sprite advertising really are one product for antitrust purposes. See Kugler v. AAMCO Automatic Transmissions, Inc., 460 
F.2d 1214 (8th Cir. 1972); United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (E.D.Pa.1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 
567, 81 S. Ct. 755, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1961). "
140,17," It would be a constitutionally impermissible re-examination of the jury's verdict for the district court to enter judgment n.o.v. on 
a ground not raised in the motion for directed verdict. Compare Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654, 55 S. 
Ct. 890, 79 L. Ed. 1636 (1935) with Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U.S. 364, 33 S. Ct. 523, 57 L. Ed. 879 (1913)."
140,18," Wilson B. Franklin, Vice President of Coca Cola USA and manager of the fountain sales department, testified that Coca Cola 
initiated this program purely in response to competitors' similar programs. Record Vol. 23 at 136-37. Coca Cola did not use the 
program in areas where competitors were not employing it, and would discontinue it in areas where rival soft drink companies 
abandoned their programs. Record Vol. 23 at 140-41."
140,19," Post-mix products are soft drinks mixed and dispensed on retail outlet premises with post-mix equipment. Mr. Franklin 
explained the mechanics of a post-mix system: Post-mix equipment is equipment that can take the syrup, whether it would be Coca-Cola syrup or any other syrup, they 
have a carbonating unit, a refrigerating unit, and a dispensing mechanism, those are the three basic components, from 
which they can dispense the drink then one at a time. That mechanism may be a one-drink unit, two-drink unit, three-drink 
unit, four-drink unit. Fast food operations such as McDonald's, Burger Chef, or Burger King are typical users of a post-mix system. "
141,20," Bottlers with franchises to bottle Coca Cola or Sprite had no direct connection with the equipment lending program. The Coca 
Cola Company made the equipment lending agreements directly with the retailer. The company then contracted with fountain 
syrup wholesalers for maintenance, but not all Sprite or Coca Cola bottlers had franchises to wholesale syrup. "

142,22," Bubble Up did not object at trial to the relevant market instruction the trial court gave; nor does it challenge the adequacy of 
that instruction here. "
143,23," Calvin C. Stoddard, a Coca Cola employee, testified: The lemon-lime market accounted for 10 or 12 percent of the total market. We, the Coca Cola Company, did not have an 
entry there. We wanted Sprite as our entry in the lemon-lime market. We wanted to advertise it and put it in the home and 
cooler market. Record Vol. 8 at 68. At the time the Coca Cola Company introduced Sprite, Mr. Stoddard was a district manager in Detroit, 
Michigan. He subsequently held various other positions with the company and was on the marketing staff for company owned 
plants at the time of trial."
143,24," Both parties agree that the relevant geographic market was the nation as a whole. That premise appears correct. See United 
States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). The Coca Cola Company and the Bubble Up

to the question of whether the Sinclair contract with Malco was a requirements contract; if Sinclair's refusal was a material 
factor resulting in that contract having the effect of a requirements contract, and that contract was illegal, then said refusal 
was a means to effectuate an illegal restraint.  These questions present material mixed questions of fact and law as to the 
effect of said refusal which are not presently resolved.  Therefore, the requirement of direct injury to the investment 
companies being unresolved, summary judgment is inappropriate. As noted previously, however, this conclusion is predicated upon the assumption that the investment companies' injury was in 
fact caused by Sinclair's refusal to finance.  Sinclair challenges this assumption, claiming that any injury resulted solely from the 
investment companies' failure to obtain alternative financing. Yet this argument assumes that alternative financing was 
reasonably then available; this fact has not been demonstrated.  Even if alternative financing arrangements were available, any 
additional costs incurred therein would have been caused by Sinclair's refusal.  The Court concludes that questions of fact 
remain as to whether Sinclair's refusal caused the investment companies' injury."

as the commission may prescribe. The commission, if in its opinion such action appears necessary or suitable in the public 
interest, may, and, upon written petition or complaint of the state, under direction of the governor, shall, make such investigation 
of such schedule of rates or proposed amendment as, in the opinion of the commission, is necessary to determine whether the 
rates specified in any schedule are unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate, or that the 
service furnished by such company is inadequate to or in excess of public necessity and convenience, and shall, in the case of a 
proposed amendment increasing the rate schedule of a gas or electric company, make such investigation and hold at least one 
public hearing thereon, provided the commission may approve without public hearing an interim rate increase under bond and 
subject to refund with interest if the rate approved after hearing is less than the interim rate and provided further the commission 
may, in its discretion, hold such hearing or hearings upon any increase in the rates charged by a gas or electric company 
resulting from the application of a fuel cost adjustment or purchased gas adjustment clause pursuant to section 16-19b.  If the 
commission finds any rate to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such 
company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive, it 
may determine and prescribe an adequate service to be furnished and just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be 
made by such company.  The commission may, in its discretion, pending its conclusion upon an amendment increasing any rate, 
suspend the effective date of such increase for not more than one hundred and fifty days from the effective date of such 
increase.  If the commission has not made its finding respecting such increase within the period of suspension, such increase 
may become effective pending the commission's finding with respect to such increase or, in the discretion of the commission,

customers such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the rates fixed by the commission in its finding or 
fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the commission.  If the commission finds that the 
imposition of any increase in rates would create a hardship for a municipality, because such increase is not reflected in its then 
current budget, or cannot be included in the budget of its fiscal year which begins less than five months after the effective date of 
such increase, the commission may defer the applicability of such increase with respect to services furnished to such 
municipality until the fiscal year of such municipality beginning not less than five months following the effective date of such 
increase; provided the revenues lost to the public service company through such deferral shall be paid to the public service 
company by the municipality in its first fiscal year following the period of such deferral.  Upon conclusion of its investigation of the 
reasonableness of such increase, the commission may order the company to refund to its customers any amounts the company 
may have collected from them during the period that such increase was in force, which amounts the commission may find to 
have been in excess of the rates fixed by the commission in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result 
of a finding by the commission.  Any such refund ordered by the commission shall be paid by the company, under direction of 
the commission, to the customer in such amounts as are determined by the commission."" "
187,14," No federal statutory provision on point has been briefed or argued.  In 1968, however, the federal communications 
commission in its Carterfone decision declared void tariffs filed with the FCC and with state regulatory commissions by all 
domestic telephone companies prohibiting the interconnection of subscriber-owned devices with the carrier's telephone system.  
In re Carterfone, 13 F.C.C.2d 420, 424-26. Forthwith the regulated telephone companies filed tariffs (similar to that of the 
defendant in this case) with the appropriate regulatory agencies providing for interconnection of such equipment so long as the 
telephone company furnished, installed and maintained the interconnect.  International Telephone & Telegraph Corporation 
v. General Telephone & Electronics Corporation, 351 F. Sup. 1153, 1179 (D. Hawaii), rev'd, 518 F.2d 913 (9th Cir.).  The 
National Academy of Sciences has since reported to the FCC that its study of the technical factors affecting interconnection 
suggests that while the use of telephone company provided protection apparatus may have been temporarily expedient, there 
should ultimately be an equipment certification program conducted by the FCC.  Id., 1179 n.59. In the meantime, courts have 
proceeded to adjudicate on the merits the validity of such apparatus requirements under federal antitrust laws. See, e.g., 
International Telephone & Telegraph Corporation v. General Telephone & Electronics Corporation, supra."

188,17," The trial court relied extensively on the reasoning in Business Aides.  The court in that case, however, had adopted the theory 
of ""state action"" immunity articulated in Washington Gas Light Co. v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 438 F.2d 248 (4th Cir.), 
which was also relied upon by both the trial court and the defendant in this case.  The Washington Gas Light theory is that mere 
acquiescence by an agency in actions taken by companies subject to public regulation constitutes a grant of immunity under 
Parker.  The validity of that theory was recently undermined by the United States Supreme Court in Goldfarb v. Virginia State 
Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, a case reversing a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision whose outcome 
had hinged on the Washington Gas Light theory.  Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 497 F.2d 1, 5 (4th Cir.).  See also 
Communication Brokers v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Virginia, 370 F. Sup. 967, 969 (W.D. Va.), where a district 
court in the Fourth Circuit declined to apply the Parker analysis of Washington Gas Light in a suit by a plaintiff engaged in the 
business of selling, leasing, installing, and repairing communication equipment, who alleged, inter alia, that the defendant "
189,," telephone company had sought to restrain unduly competition by deliberately delaying the procurement of ""interface devices"" 
necessary for the interconnection of the plaintiff's equipment to the defendant's network.  The theory underlying Washington Gas 
Light, also followed in Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., 440 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1062,

""permitted"" by regulatory agencies, a measure adopted in several other jurisdictions.  See, e.g., Minn. Stat. § 325.8017.2; Va.

16-19 of the General Statutes."

207,10," The debates in 1943 were inconclusive, although the House then, as later, seemed more inclined to grant a proposed antitrust 
exemption for insurance. 89 Cong.Rec. 10144-10152 and 10659-10664 (1943); and see also extensions of remarks in the 
Appendix of the Congressional Record, beginning at A5272, A5377 and A5683. The House passed a bill with an exemption for 
insurance in 1944. 90 Cong. Rec. 6417-6419, 6449-6456, 6524-6557, and 6559-6566 (1944). The bill was reported out of 
committee in the Senate but died on the calendar. 90 Cong.Rec. 8054 (1944). "
208,11," An independent line of cases deals with whether state power to regulate or tax insurance companies is impeded by the 
Commerce Clause. The leading cases are Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 66 S. Ct. 1142, 90 L. Ed. 1342 
(1946) and Robertson v. California, 328 U.S. 440, 66 S. Ct. 1160, 90 L. Ed. 1366 (1946). There is language in these opinions 
that the intent of Congress in enacting the McCarran Act was to give the states full use of their power in the insurance field up to 
the legislatively unavoidable limits of the Commerce Clause. Of course, Congress meant to permit full state regulation of 
insurance, but it also provided that in the absence of appropriate state legislation the federal antitrust laws would apply without 
additional action by Congress. What we must decide is the standard for state statutes regulating insurance under § 2(b) and 
whether the statute in this case meets that standard. Another line of cases considers what activities constitute the business of insurance under § 2(b) to determine the application of 
other federal statutes, most notably the federal securities laws, SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 89 S. Ct. 564, 21 
L. Ed. 2d 668 (1969), and to determine whether the federal securities laws cover certain annuity contracts issued by insurance 
companies, SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 65, 79 S. Ct. 618, 3 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1959); SEC v. United Benefit Life 
Ins. Co., 387 U.S. 202, 87 S. Ct. 1557, 18 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1967)."
208,12," In the other case, FTC v. Travelers Health Assn., 362 U.S. 293, 80 S. Ct. 717, 4 L. Ed. 2d 724 (1960), the Court held that by 
state regulation Congress meant regulation by the state in which the disputed acts took place. Thus Nebraska could not render 
federal laws ineffective in other states with respect to the activities of Nebraska domiciliary corporations by declaring that it was 
regulating the out-of-state activities of its domiciliary corporations."
208,13, Brief of Petitioner at 3.

209,16," As noted above, footnote 5, the Senate amended the original bill because it thought § 2(b) would authorize the states to 
sanction Sherman and Clayton violations. Its amended bill excluded the Sherman and Clayton acts from the operation of § 2(b) 
altogether. In the debate on the conference report Senators McCarran and O'Mahoney emphasized that only state legislation 
regulating insurance, not just any state legislation, would satisfy § 2(b). See 91 Cong.Rec. 1443 and 1444 (1945) (printed in the 
appendix to this opinion). Senator Pepper, in attacking the compromise, made the strongest statements concerning what the 
provision would permit. See 91 Cong.Rec. 1478, 1480, 1481, 1485 (1945). The response of Senator O'Mahoney was that the bill 
only authorized the states to permit what would otherwise be Sherman or Clayton violations if they used something like ICC or 
state public utility rate-setting mechanisms, 91 Cong.Rec. 1483 (1945), and again that it did not permit private regulation but only 
""public regulations written by public authority,"" 91 Cong.Rec. 1485 (1945). Private combinations or agreements were acceptable 
""provided those combinations and agreements were in the open and approved by law. Public supervision of agreements is 
essential,"" 91 Cong.Rec. 1486 (1945). He thus put content into the precise phrasing of the main part of § 2(b) that only state 
statutes ""regulating the business of insurance"" were covered by the section (emphasis added). "
210,17," Plaintiffs raised other contentions as to the weaknesses of the statute. See 451 F.2d at 1180, and the opinion of Justice 
Douglas dissenting from the denial of certiorari, 409 U.S. at 917-918, 93 S. Ct. 215, 34 L. Ed. 2d at 180-181."
210,18," Such a quasi-legislative pronouncement, and an inaccurate one at that, is to be given little weight as a barometer of legislative 
intent. See the discussion in Mount Sinai Medical Center of Greater Miami v. Weinberger, 517 F.2d 329 (5th Cir. 1975)."
210,19," See footnote 11, supra. "
211,20," American Family Life Assur. Co. v. Blue Cross of Fla., Inc., 486 F.2d 225 (CA5, 1973) (monopolization charge based on Blue 
Cross' ""coordination of benefits"" provision failed because the restraint of trade was not unreasonable, so there was no antitrust 
violation at all); American Gen. Ins. Co. v. FTC, 496 F.2d 197 (CA5, 1974) (FTC sought injunction against merger of insurance 
companies; denial affirmed because of Commission's failure to exhaust its own administrative remedies); and Battle v. Liberty 
Nat. Life. Ins. Co., 493 F.2d 39 (CA5, 1974), cert. denied 419 U.S. 1110, 95 S. Ct. 784, 42 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1975), (trial court 
granted Rule 12(b)(6) motion; remand for more findings; record not adequate to determine whether defendants were in the 
business of insurance)."
211,21," This section provides that the Sherman Act shall apply to any agreements to or acts of boycott, coercion or intimidation, the 
moratorium and other provisions notwithstanding."
211,22," The two district court cases cited by the majority do not add anything new. Harrison v. Chicago Title Insurance Co., 1974-2 
Trade Regulation Reports 98,022 (D.Kan.1974), reaches the same conclusion as the District Court in the present case, in almost 
the same language, and relying upon the same cases, National Casualty, California League and Commander Leasing. Mitgang "
212,," v. Western Title Insurance Co., 1971-2 Trade Regulation Reports 98,024 (N.D.Cal.,1974) follows California League from the 
same court in holding sufficient to create the § 2(b) exception a general antitrust law. The opinion notes, however, that 
California now regulates rates for title insurance by law so that ""state law at present fully covers the area complained of by 
plaintiffs."""
212,23," In that case the FTC quoted extensively from the legislative history but did not cite or rely on any of the pertinent material here 
discussed and included in the appendix to this opinion."
212,24," Both insurance regulators and executives read the McCarran Act in 1945, as I do now, to require that state regulation be 
effective if it is to render federal law inapplicable. A committee of the American Mutual Alliance reported that ""regulated by state 
law"" meant ""a valid statute, or regulation having the force of law, plus a means of enforcement, which deals 'affirmatively' and 
effectively with the activitiy in question and under which the business is governed and directed according to stated standards."" 
Special Committee on Legislation, American Mutual Alliance, Preliminary Memorandum Re the Effect upon the Insurance 
Business of the Clayton, Robinson-Patman, and Federal Trade Commission Acts (Chicago, July 15, 1945) at 5, quoted in 
Council of State Governments, Insurance Committee, ""Revision of State Systems for Insurance Regulation: Report and 
Recommendations,"" (December 1946) at 5. The Council of State Governments' insurance committee came to the same 
conclusion. Revision of State Systems at 8, 12, 21-22."
212,25, See in particular the exchange between Senators Pepper and Ferguson in 91 Cong.Rec. 1481 (1945).
212,26," See in particular the comments of Senator O'Mahoney, a co-sponsor of the bill, in 91 Cong.Rec. 1480, 1483, 1485 and 1486 
(1945)."
212,27," See Revision of State Systems, supra, footnote 24, at 4. See also the comments of Senator Ferguson, 91 Cong.Rec. 479 
(1945) and of Representative Walter, 91 Cong.Rec. 978 and 1086 (1945)."
212,28," The insurance committee's position is contained in its Revision of State Systems, supra, footnote 24."
212,29," The powers granted to insurance commissions in the Unfair Trade Practices Act for Insurance were specifically designed to 
match the Clayton, FTC and Robinson-Patman Acts. See Revision of State Systems, supra, footnote 24, at 21-22. "
213,30," The subject matter with which we are concerned is price-fixing by title insurers. In part the District Court rested its decision 
upon state regulation of the title insurance business in general. Regulation of other aspects of that business, however 
comprehensive and extensive, cannot contribute to adequacy of an antitrust regulatory system with respect to § 2(b). Congress 
hardly intended that state regulation of the form of policies, licensing of agents, capital structure of companies, and the like, was 
to have any relationship to whether federal or state law would regulate antitrust activities"
213,31," Compare with this the general rule for appeals from decisions and orders of the commissioner, § 47(5), which gives prima 
facie effect to the commissioner's decision, presumably covering both questions of fact and conclusions of law. Such decisions 
can be reversed or modified only if ""substantial rights"" were prejudiced on a question of law, findings were contrary to the weight 
of the evidence, or the commissioner's action was arbitrary or capricious. "
214,32," The courts of two other states, both of which enacted variations of the model statute here in question, have come to contrary 
results on the question of whether there is an implied private remedy for violations of specifically enumerated unfair trade 
practices.  Greenberg v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., 34 Cal.App.3d 994, 110 Cal.Rptr. 470 (1973) (implied 
remedy); Retail Clerks Welfare Fund v. Continental Casualty Co., 71 N.J.Super. 221, 176 A.2d 524 (1961) (no implied remedy); 
cf., Craver v. Union Fidelity Life Ins. Co., 37 Ohio App.2d 100, 307 N.E.2d 265, 66 O.O.2d 170 (1973) (insurer held to contract 
on representations in advertisements, based in part on policy against deceptive insurance advertising). In all three of these 
cases the practice complained of was specifically enumerated. Where the practice has not been determined to be an unfair trade 
practice, and the commissioner is specifically empowered to hold hearings and make such determinations, it is even less likely 
that an implied private remedy would be found."
214,33," Revision of State Systems, supra, footnote 24, at 21-22."
214,34," Revision of State Systems, supra, footnote 24, at 10-11. The Council of State Governments' committee viewed the FTC as a 
supplementary mechanism, and considered the Unfair Trade Practices Act as simply meeting the scope of the federal agency, 
id., at 21. Alabama adopted this scheme as to all lines of insurance save title and accident and health. Tit. 28A, § 253."
214,35," As noted, supra, footnote 24, the Council also believed from its reading of the legislative history that state regulatory systems 
must be adequate to trigger § 2(b). Revisions of State Systems at 8, 12, 21-22."
214,36," Senator O'Mahoney quoted the language of Parker v. Brown that states could not authorize Sherman Act violations, 317 U.S. 
at 351, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. at 326, 91 Cong.Rec. 1480 (1945). Senator Pepper responded that Parker v. Brown did not 
involve a statute like the proposed McCarran Act, 91 Cong.Rec. 1480 (1945). Although Senator O'Mahoney did not respond to 
that point, his numerous references to the necessity for state supervision, see footnote 16, supra, make it clear that only such 
supervisory regulatory systems were within the scope of § 2(b). Where the wrong complained of is insurance companies' 
cooperation in submitting rates to a state official for approval, the Noerr doctrine should apply.  Eastern Railroad Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, reh. denied 365 U.S. 875, 81 S. Ct. 899, 5 L. 
Ed. 2d 864 (1961). Moreover, Congress may not have contemplated judicial review of the adequacy of state regulatory systems authorizing rate-
setting otherwise in violation of federal law. On the second day of debate on the conference report the Senate considered rate-
making that would otherwise be in violation of federal law, and the point reiterated by Senator Murdock in that context was that 
Congress always retained the power to make specific provision for insurance regulation if the states' performance were not 
satisfactory to it. This argument was based on § 2(b), which provides that state law shall not be invalidated by an act of 
Congress ""unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance."" See 91 Cong.Rec. at 1481, 1482 and 1484; see 
also the comments of Senators O'Mahoney and Barkley at 1486-1487 and of Senator Ferguson at 1487 (1945). The only 
references during this second day of debate to the ""adequacy"" of state regulation generally were made by Senator Barkley, 91 
Cong.Rec. 1486 and 1488. In light of the emphasis in that day's debate on rate-setting otherwise in violation of the Sherman Act, "
215,," I think this reference to an ultimate appeal to Congress does not negate the requirement discussed the first day that state laws 
prohibiting ""combinations and restraints of trade,"" 91 Cong.Rec. 1444 (1945), must be adequate."
215,37," Plaintiffs represent to us that the commissioner has never secured an injunction against price-fixing, indeed has never cited 
any insurance company for price-fixing. I need not comment upon whether lack of enforcement will cause a facially effective 
statute not to trigger § 2(b). In this instance, where the statute is suspect if not inadequate on its face, the absence of 
enforcement directed against price-fixing is at least circumstantial evidence of inadequacy. In the absence of any case law on 
adequacy, courts will be better able to determine what statutes are adequate if trial courts compile informative records on how 
the various statutes have been utilized. "
219,1," Section 3(4) of the Illinois Antitrust Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 38, § 60-3(4)) provided: ""Every person shall be deemed to have 
committed a violation of this Act who shall: "
220,," (4) Lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, or 
services, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption, enjoyment, or resale, or fix a price charged thereof, or 
discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser 
thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodity or service of a 
competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale or contract for such sale or such 
condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line 
of commerce."" "
224,1," The parties have devoted much discussion in their briefs to whether the ""pervasive regulatory scheme"" provided by the federal 
securities acts renders this case ""immune"" from the laws of antitrust. Because I conclude that the Sherman Act does not in the 
first instance apply to the facts alleged by plaintiff, the question of antitrust immunity here pares down to irrelevancy."
224,2," Section 10, entitled ""Regulation of the Use of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices,"" reads in relevant part: "

commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange --"
225,*," * * (b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security * * *, any manipulative or deceptive device or 
contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors."""
225,3," Rule 10b-5, entitled ""Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices,"" reads as follows: HN3[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate 
commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange (1) to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, (2) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any 
person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."""
225,4," According to plaintiff, defendants are chargeable, not alone with misrepresentation, but with non-disclosure as well, the later on 
the ground that defendants failed to apprise Madison that Charter did not intend to include Madison's shares in the December 2 
registration statement. Thus, in essence, Madison urges that defendants may be liable not only for the false assurances 
allegedly given by them, but also for their failure to reveal that those assurances were false.  Such two-sided coin does not hold 
currency with this Court."
225,5," In Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 153, 31 L. Ed. 2d 741, 92 S. Ct. 1456 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled 
that in cases of non-disclosure ""positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery."" Nonetheless, materiality -- defined by 
Affiliated Ute to subsume ""that [which] a reasonable investor might have considered * * * important in the making of his decision"" 
-- still must be shown.  List v. Fashion Park, Inc., 340 F.2d 457, 462 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 811, 86 S. Ct. 23, 15 L. Ed. 
2d 60 (1965). Moreover, there is some force to the Third Circuit's reasoning that Affiliated Ute has not rendered the question of 
actual reliance wholly irrelevant in non-disclosure cases, at least where ""defendant is able to demonstrate that there was clearly 
no reliance, that is, that even if the material facts had been disclosed, plaintiff's decision as to the transaction would not have 
been different * * *."" Rochez Brothers, Inc. v. Rhoades, 491 F.2d 402, 410 (3d Cir. 1974). See also List v. Fashion Park, Inc., 
supra at 463-64. "
226,6," It should be noted that plaintiff has not alleged that it had purchased its Charter shares in reliance on Charter's representation 
that the shares would be included in any registration and that Charter had at that time intended not to perform.  Were such "
227,," allegations the substance of the complaint, Madison would apparently have standing as a purchaser. See Devonbrook, Inc. v. 
Lily Lynn, Inc., CCH FED. SEC. L. REP. P 94,621 at 96,205 note 1 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). "
234,1," The employment of so-called ""dirty tricks"" may be evidence of an attempt to exclude, and, in a situation where it is clear that 
only one competitor may survive, this factor may be crucial. Thus, Judge Wyzansky has stated ( Union Leader Corp. v. 
Newspapers of New England, Inc., 180 F. Supp. 125, 140 (D. Mass. 1959), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 284 F.2d 582 (1st Cir. 
1960), cert. den., 365 U.S. 833, 81 S. Ct. 747, 5 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1961): "". . . we may say that there is no sharp distinction between (a) the existence of an intent to exclude and (b) the use of unfair 
means. In a situation where it is inevitable that only one competitor can survive, the evidence which shows the use, or 
contemplated use, of unfair means is the very same evidence which shows the existence of an exclusionary intent. . . ."" This 
may be the real, unarticulated basis for Perryton, et al., but the quotation above demonstrates the importance of the factor of 
defendants' practical ability to take over completely. Such evidence is not present in this case. "
240,1," The Silent Watchman Corporation is successor in interest to or has used the name of The Recording Devices Company, Lock-
Tronic Corporation, Controlock Corporation and Dayton Time Lock Company. "
241,2," The trial court found: ""4. The Original Agreement expressly withheld the exclusive right to lease and service Dayton Time Locks to chain organizations 
from plaintiff. ""5. A chain organization as defined by the Original Agreement is any organization having a place of business in any of the states 
of California, Oregon or Washington and in one or more states in addition thereto. ""6. Plaintiff may lease and service Dayton Time Locks in the states of Arizona and Nevada to chain organizations on a non-
exclusive basis which have places of business in California, Oregon or Washington and branch business locations in the states 
of Arizona and/or Nevada. ""7. Plaintiff has been granted no right to lease and service Dayton Time Locks in states other than California, Oregon, 
Washington, Nevada and Arizona."""
241,3," Paragraph 15 of the agreement provides: ""[Plaintiff] agrees that, during the life of this contract, and any renewal or extension 
thereof, except as herein provided, it will not sell or lease any locks, devices or service of any kind in competition with the

understood that the above limitation excludes the present business of [plaintiff] in alarm exit locks and/or sequel locks."" "
242,4," ""2. The Original Agreement, and every provision contained therein, is clear and unambiguous. ""3. Under the terms of the Original Agreement defendant granted plaintiff the exclusive right to lease from defendant and 
thereafter to service a door lock, manufactured by defendant known as 'Dayton Time Lock' in the states of California, Oregon, 
and Washington. "". . . . ""10. The Amendatory Agreement, and every provision contained therein, is clear and unambiguous. ""11. The Amendatory Agreement did not grant plaintiff the right to lease the device known as the 'Controlock' from defendant. ""12. The Controlock is not within the meaning of the term 'improvement' as said term is used in paragraph 7 of the Original 
Agreement. ""13. Plaintiff and defendant never contemplated nor intended that the Controlock would be included within or be the subject of 
any of the provisions of either the Original or Amendatory Agreements. ""14. Defendant never agreed, orally or in writing, to supply plaintiff with the device known as the Controlock on any basis other 
than an experimental or test basis. ""15. Plaintiff and defendant never agreed to a price to be charged if the Controlock were ever supplied to plaintiff by defendant 
on any basis other than an experimental or test basis. ""16. Any Controlocks supplied to plaintiff by defendant were for testing purposes only and were not supplied under the Original 
Agreement or the Amendatory Agreement. ""17. Neither defendant nor plaintiff by either act or conduct, interpreted or construed the provisions of the Original Agreement or 
the Amendatory Agreement to include the Controlock."" "
243,5," The court concluded: ""12. Plaintiff and defendant did not agree, either orally or in writing, that defendants, or any of them, would repay in any manner

277,27," In his oath supporting the reissue application, plaintiff's vice president stated unequivocally '. . . that claim 10 in original form is

277,28," Moreover, counsel for I.B.M. were, for that reason, not familiar with the machine tool industry. "
278,12," Judge Stevens noted this was a dramatic change in Kearney & Trecker's position that 29 of 60 claims in the reissue patent 
were infringed. 452 F.2d at 580-581. "
279,13," We should note that since Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., supra, another Court has reached a conclusion 
opposite to the one reached by the Seventh Circuit on the propriety of Beall's conduct. In that case Beall sued K&T for damages 
for premature termination of his contract as a consultant. Beall prevailed because the Court found the evidence offered by K&T 
legally insufficient to establish Beall had ""personally and substantially"" participated in the evaluation of the Brainard patent while 
at the Patent Office. Beall v. Kearney & Trecker Corp., 350 F. Supp. 978, 983 (D. Md., 1972). Thus, the Court was unable to 
conclude that K&T had shown that Beall violated the conflict of interest provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. § 207. The Court 
recognized that its conclusion ran counter to the holding of the Seventh Circuit on the same issue but said: A comparison of the evidence available to each court, however, will illustrate the reasons for this difference. As was 
discussed more fully above, the only substantial evidence before this court relevant to the question of whether Beall had 
""personally and substantially"" participated in the evaluation of Kearney & Trecker's patent was that two out of four pieces of 
Patent Office correspondence bore his signature. The Seventh Circuit, on the other hand, had before it evidence that in 
December of 1959, Beall had personally visited the Kearney & Trecker plant in Milwaukee to observe a demonstration of 
the machine for which the patent application had been made.  452 F.2d at 585. Furthermore, in the Seventh Circuit case, 
there was evidence that Beall had had several discussions with the defendant's patent counsel in relation to the then 
pending application, and that changes in the application were made by Kearney & Trecker at Beall's suggestion.  452 F.2d 
at 585-586. It was from this evidence, which was not presented in the instant case, that the Seventh Circuit was able to find 
that ""Beall participated personally and directly in the deliberations within the Patent Office which preceded the issuance of 
the original Brainard patent"" and that ""[Beall's] signature on the Notice of Allowance was not a mere ministerial act."" 452 
F.2d at 590. "
280,," Thus, Beall prevailed in his action for damages for premature termination of his contract as a consultant. This puts K&T in the 
same position as the man who was sued for divorce by his wife on the grounds of impotency and at the same time by another 
woman in a bastardy case -- and he lost both cases. From the evidence in the case before this Court, the amount K&T paid to Mr. Beall would not be great. There is no evidence in 
this case as to K&T's losses resulting from the decision in the Giddings & Lewis case. However, in Beall, supra, at 980, the Court 
stated: ""As a direct consequence of this decision [Giddings & Lewis], Kearney & Trecker have incurred damages in excess of 
four million dollars."" "
281,14," This distinction does not mean a thing according to one text writer who says it is: "". . . arguable that unenforceability of the patent on this basis [procurement of a patent by fraud on the Patent Office] should 
be pleadable as an estoppel to the same extent as invalidity, thus rendering immaterial the imprecise characterization of 
unenforceability as invalidity . . . ."" Hamburg, Patent Fraud and Inequitable Conduct, Vol. 1, p. 4-12. The author notes that the Supreme Court in Blonder-Tongue used the term ""invalid"" in characterizing its holding in Walker 
Process concerning ""the consequences of procurement of a patent by fraud or enforcement of a patent with knowledge that it 
was procured by fraud"" (emphasis supplied), thus apparently obliterating the distinction between invalidity and unenforceability. 
Id., 4-11. He concludes that ""it would seem more equitable that the estoppel rule of Blonder-Tongue be applicable to unenforceability as 
well as invalidity than not be so applicable."" Id., p. 4-13. "
285,15," In such cases: "". . . [Courts] of equity do not make the quality of suitors the test. They apply the maxim requiring clean hands only where 
some unconscionable act of one coming for relief has immediate and necessary relation to the equity that he seeks in

286,16," For another definition of fraud, see also § 1.03, Patent Fraud and Inequitable Conduct, Hamburg (Clark Boardman Company, 
Ltd., 1973). "
290,17," The defendant contends the Brainard patent is invalid in the light of the prior art, 35 U.S.C. § 103; that it lacks novelty under 
35 U.S.C. § 102; and that the facts require the conclusion of law that the patent is invalid by reason of obviousness."
290,18," There is considerable confusion in the testimony regarding project numbers assigned to work done for Hughes at Kearney 
and Trecker and work which Kearney and Trecker allege was their own independent and entirely separate project. However, a 
number of the exhibits make clear that both project numbers ED 74 and ED 77 were used on the Hughes line of machine, one 
being the first of the three-machine line project, and the other being an evolution of further development which was also begun 
and implemented under the joint venture. As things turned out, the ""second project"" turned into the Milwaukee-Matic project as 
time went on and Hughes withdrew from the venture. This is clear from the testimony of John Hansen, K&T's project engineer: ""Q I believe there were certain developments, however, that were made which were not Flexomatic I developments which I 
believe we have referred to as Flexomatic II developments. . . . "
291,," ""A Yes. But I cannot use the term Flexomatic II because the same designs were later used in the Milwaukee-Matic and so 
there's no real distinction between Flexomatic II, as you call it, and Milwaukee-Matic."" See also the testimony of Hughes' Dr. Leone, tr. 1873, et seq."
291,19," Dx 54, Wagenseil to Russell, monthly report, shows that in December, 1956 Brainard became responsible for the physical 
design of the next series of K&T machines, using Hughes controls, and at the same time K&T would be receiving and 
assembling Hughes' Model II control unit."" "
292,20," The tremendous scope of the research and development project at Hughes to apply numerical control to machine tools cannot 
go unnoticed. The Hughes exhibits numbering in the hundreds point out clearly what enormous effort and what brilliant scientific "
293,," talent went into this effort. The earliest exhibit we can find is dx 755, dated February 15, 1954, prepared by Wallace Brainard, 
then assistant to the head of the Manufacturing Division (Division 16) at Hughes. It demonstrates the knowledge and skill of Mr. 
Brainard and the work already done at that point in time at Hughes in research and development to the breadboard testing stage 
of Brainard's Magpie project. Management at Hughes had initiated and encouraged such projects and the Magpie program 
evolved into a development later known as Automatex, which, in its turn, was broadened and redeveloped into the Flexomatic 
project, which was the project involved in the joint venture with Kearney & Trecker. The skill of the people working on these projects to use numerical control in the best way to create a fully automatic machine tool 
is set out, for example, in dx 390, dated March 28, 1955, in a report and projection of future goals prepared by Michael May, 
Senior Technical Staff at Hughes. He lists the personnel then available to work on the project. We incorporate that list here: J. V. Blankenbaker -- Responsible for the logical design of the HAC data processor. D. L. Curtis -- (after termination of present commitments) Responsible for the circuit designs in the HAC data processor. D. C. Hierath -- Staff engineer. Designer and project engineer for the machine control equipment being designed in digital 
systems and control department. Twenty-six years electrical engineering experience. R. R. Johnson -- Ph. D., Cal. Tech. expected June 1955. Digital computer, logical design and systems engineering experience. T. T. Kumagai -- Digital computer design experience; systems engineering experience. Logical design of the HAC printer. W. C. Leone -- Ph.D. Carnegie Tech. Professor of Mechanical Engineering Section Head at HAC, Control Engineering Section. M. Phister -- Ph.D., Cambridge. Digital computer, logical design and systems engineering experience. A. D. Scarbrough -- Ph. D., Cal. Tech. expected June 1955. Transistor digital computer project leader at HAC. H. L. Shoemaker -- Section Head, Digital Systems Section. Responsible for the system engineering, logical design and circuits 
for the HAC Data Processor. Coming into the project as heads later we find such people as Dr. Raymond Griest, with Ph.D.s in three fields -- electrical 
engineering, mathematics and physics; William Wagenseil, DSE in Mathematics, lecturer in physics at UCLA, inventor for Bell 
Laboratories with patents on telephone switching from 1936-1950; Dr. William Leone, previously mentioned on Mr. May's list, 
now a V.P. of Rheem Mfg.; Dr. Rollin M. Russell, on the policy board for Hughes and later a Vice President, with a long 
background of research in applied sciences; Dr. Lawrence A. Hyland, Vice President and General Manager of Hughes Aircraft 
since 1954, with an outstanding background of scientific achievement and awards (dx 397). Dr. Hyland was in overall charge of the automation program at Hughes and his testimony (tr. Vol. 19), as well as the testimony of 
Dr. Griest (tr. Vol. 22), that of Dr. Russell (tr. Vol. 30) and that of William Wagenseil (tr. Vols. 16-18) and of Dr. Leone (tr. Vols. 
11-15) show the depth and breadth of the work done at Hughes. This testimony also shows that after the joint venture was 
begun with Kearney & Trecker, the Hughes team was very much in the picture, continuing to study, work out details, and 
planning and designing in furtherance of the joint project. See, e.g., the monthly status reports of Wagenseil to Russell (dx 100, 
et seq.); and see, e.g., the exchanges between Dr. Leone of Hughes and Joerger and Hansen of Kearney and Trecker (dx. 154, 
et seq.). It is noteworthy also that throughout the program, from the Magpie onwards, Wallace E. Brainard was in a peculiarly important 
position. He was in on the earliest developments and explorations at Hughes and continued in an inventive and executive 
capacity there until he left in February, 1956 and went to work for Kearney & Trecker, where, of course, he continued in the 
same field of machine tool automation, but on behalf of Kearney & Trecker. In contrast to this fund of knowledge and skill in the art of numerical control of machine tools at Hughes and which Mr. Brainard 
personally possessed or could call upon while at Hughes, we note dx 149, a memorandum written by J. R. Joerger (B.S. 
Mechanical Engineering, 20 year K&T employee, then Sales Manager at K&T), dated November 22, 1955, regarding a visit by 
Mr. Brainard of Hughes to discuss an idea ""they have for tape control machining processes."" He ends by saying: ""The entire 
idea appears to be nebulous, if not fantastic, . . ."" Morris L. Hutchens, Brainard's ""boss"" at K&T, asserted (tr. 9704, et seq.) that 
K&T had ""done work in the numerical control area * * * back in 1943."" But there is no documentation to support this that we can 
find, except that Mr. Sipek (Project Engineer for Flexomatic and Milwaukee-Matic) refers to ""tracer controlled skin mills"" which 
K&T produced in the period 1948-1954. It is also of interest to note that ten months after the joint venture was in progress, Joerger of K&T visited Hughes (dx 660) and 
reported on a demonstration ""covering the single axis control of a No. 2 K&T Horizontal Mill."" This machine had been converted 
to numerical control at Hughes for their own purposes (to prove the feasibility of their control system) (Leone, tr. 1891-93). Mr. "
294,," Joerger comments the demonstration was a success, and ""[after] seeing this performance, I am certain that they will not have 
many problems in making any overall system operate."" He recognizes that Hughes thinks K&T is going to have a large 
engineering staff available for this type of proposal work. I might note that as an organization K&T has a very ordinary proposal 
section in the past. He also notes that ""K&T is becoming less important to Hughes each day. Don't think for one minute that they 
are dependent on us, because our contribution to this program so far has been a bare minimum."" Another member of the K&T 
""team,"" I. R. Gregor reports in dx 663 his impressions following a visit to Hughes in November of 1956 (11 months after the 
contract was signed) and in this comprehensive report and analysis it seems evident that indeed K&T has up to this time 
contributed a ""bare minimum."" "
295,21," For example, on October 21, 1955, Wallace Brainard wrote in a detailed report to his superior Parkhurst: ""Raymo Woolridge is 
probably working on automatic control and is probably aware of everything HAC [Hughes] has conceived. We have had a 
periodic transfer of people intimately familiar with our work to R.W."" "
296,," William Wagenseil, Hughes executive, states in his deposition, at r. 2485-90: ""The organization which became Industrial 
Systems and Controls [the Hughes side of the Kearney & Trecker-Hughes joint venture] had previously been working on 
computers of the data-processing and computation type. In the course of this work they developed a number of concepts, some 
of which were patented and some of which were not, which really became standards in parts of the industry. This occurred as 
the people left Hughes and took the information with them. * * * The Hughes patent people would not prosecute people who 
stole the Hughes patents. * * * [People] departing from Hughes tended to take their information with them and the control on the 
departure of information from Hughes was very poor."" The testimony of John A. Hansen (tr. Vols. 31-32) seems to indicate that Hughes invented nothing and that all inventions on the 
Flexomatic line were made at K&T. It must be noted that K&T obtained patents on inventions made on the Flexomatic line. Mr. 
Hansen asserts: there were no mechanical engineering people at Hughes except a few assistants; there was no one in overall 
command at Hughes who was an expert in the field of machine tool automation (tr. 5707, et seq.). Mr. Hansen was not even 
sure where the idea for a three-machine line came from; he thought perhaps that was a K&T idea, too. He had ""no experience at 
that time in numerical controls"" (tr. 5481). Throughout the testimony of Mr. Wagenseil, Dr. Russell, and Dr. Leone and others there is mention of Hughes' getting 
something done to obtain patent coverage on inventions which they ""felt sure"" were being made by Hughes people during the 
Flexomatic project with K&T. See, e.g., px 231, in which Dr. Leone described to Hughes' patent counsel some of the concepts 
he believed Hughes should patent. These included ""joint patent participation [with K&T personnel] in both mechanism and 
control"" on the drilling machine drum indexing functional diagram; drilling machine elementary diagram sheet No. 4. As to drilling 
and tapping functional diagram, he says: ""HAC should file separately on the drill spindle and tapping spindle mechanical design. 
The original design was HAC's, including a three-speed gear box, jaw clutch coupling, hydraulic feed on drill, lead screw tapping, 
stationary drill busing attached to quill, position control on drill depth, and limit switch control on tapping spindle."" As to ""Boring 
head-two spindle,"" he says: ""both the general configuration and the means of tool radius control are exclusively HAC's."" 
However, Dr. Leone was never contacted about what was or was not to be patented by Hughes or what his or others' 
contributions were (tr. 2170). Dr. Leone, in answer to the question about what K&T added to the Flexomatic machine as built, 
said: ""Nothing."" (tr. 1855-57). "
297,22," While nothing at Hughes made Brainard obvious, perhaps it should be noted that at Hughes the idea of a hybrid or single 
machine existed in 1956 according to Mr. Wagenseil and was worked on on the q.t. without official sanction (r. 2355). K&T was 
the customer in mind and their requirements as to drill speed, tolerances, etc., were more severe than their requirements for the 
first set of machines (r. 2355). Wagenseil indicated the thought of a hybrid machine with simplified controls providing all the table 
motions in a simple table with the different cutters approaching it was not unique to him but was ""sort of a general discussion of 
these kinds of problems"" (r. 2357). He made personal sketches of a machine he believed would be reasonably versatile and a lot 
cheaper than the Flexomatic line (r. 2358). However, no money was appropriated for this (4. 2376). Wagenseil was just ""trying to 
look ahead and anticipate when they [Hughes] would finally come around to my point of view (r. 2376). "

of attorney fees and other expenses constituting such injury. Hence, Giddings & Lewis is not considered pertinent to this aspect 
of our discussion, i.e., pertinent to the discussion as to when, if ever, attorney fees are assessible as damages in an antitrust 
action. Giddings & Lewis after remand was presumably settled. However, in a reported case, a Court stated that Kearney & 
Trecker's damages were in excess of $4 million.  Beall v. Kearney & Trecker Corp., 350 F. Supp. 978, 980 (D. Md., 1972). The Court of Appeals took note, as we do, of the District Court's conclusion that the original Brainard patent was valid when 
issued September 4, 1962, and stated that by then-presumably by virtue of the superior quality of its machine-plaintiff had 
already obtained a position of market leadership. The Court noted that it was not until after the reissue that the defendant "

its own research and development."" Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., supra, at 600. Along that line, there is nothing in this case to suggest ""in terrorem"" effect of the reissue claims had any impact on the defendant

acquisition of the Morgan patent, it should be noted that under the agreement K&T was bound to issue licenses to anybody and "
309,," everybody and a percentage of the license fees went to IBM. IBM had good reason to sell the machine because it was not in the 
machine tool business and K&T was. If K&T refused to license a customer, IBM reserved the right to do so itself. In sum, that 
analysis of the evidence led this Court to the conclusion that the antitrust violation resulted only from the abuse by K&T of the 
reissue privilege. There was no violation of § 7 of Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. "

324,2," At least one authority, Willis & Pitofsky, Antitrust Consequences of Using Corporate Subsidiaries, 43 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 20, 35 
(1968) argues that to allow affiliated corporations not in competition with each other to constitute a conspiracy would discourage 
corporations from decentralizing corporate management, which they would normally do for reasons which have nothing to do 
with market considerations. The article suggests that the intra corporate conspiracy theory be utilized only when the parent and 
subsidiary publicly adopt a competitive posture a la Kiefer-Stewart, or the parent does business through subsidiaries and uses 
the subsidiaries to produce anti-competitive effects a la Yellow Cab.  Id. at 35. Neither of these conditions is present in this case."

not mere violation of the statute. The damage for which recovery may be had in a civil action must be proximately related to the 
conspiracy; recovery for a statutory violation is not based on the conspiracy itself but on injury to the plaintiff produced by 
specific overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy. The 'mere existence of a violation is not sufficient ipso facto to support the action' 
and a 'private person has no right to complain of a violation of § 1 or § 2 as such, nor does such a violation per se give a private

357,8," The facts in Bushie are virtually identical to those before us.  In Bushie, the plaintiff, formerly a distributor for defendant 
manufacturer, brought suit under Sections I and II of the Sherman Act when the defendant canceled his distributorship contract 
and retained a new distributor. The Ninth Circuit affirmed summary judgment in defendant's favor.  In finding that the plaintiff did 
not present a Section I claim, the court conceded that the agreement between the manufacturer and the new distributor would 
eliminate the plaintiff as a distributor, but the court held that this effect would not support a conclusion that the manufacturer's 
motive was anti-competitive. Hence, the court ruled that a manufacturer may discontinue dealing with a particular distributor for 
business reasons sufficient only to itself; any adverse effects upon the distributor are immaterial absent any arrangement 
restraining trade.  460 F.2d at 119-120. In regard to the Section II claim, the court held that unless the manufacturer uses the 
control over his own products to establish market dominance, the antitrust laws are not violated.  Id. at 120-121. "
358,9," Although Cicione claims that Schmidt illegally dictated resale prices and maintained territorial restraints, it does not allege that 
the termination was in any way related to the price fixing or territorial limitations.  Therefore, there was no ""causal nexus"" 
between these alleged violations and the cancellation.  See, Hutchinson v. American Oil Company, 221 F. Supp. 728 (E.D. Pa. 
1963). Furthermore, as discussed hereinafter, we find the allegations of price fixing and territorial restraints to be legally 
deficient."

Schmidt's motion for summary judgment, pg. 5, paragraph 23. "
359,11," Although there are cases which hold that a dangerous probability of monopolization is not an essential element of proof, see, 
Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459, 474 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993 84 S. Ct. 1920, 12 L. ed. 2d 1046

such proof. "
360,12," Cicione further contends, with respect to its cancellation, that Mariniello v. Shell Oil Company, 511 F.2d 853 (3d Cir. 1975) and 
Shell Oil Co. v. Marinello, 63 N.J. 402, 307 A.2d 598 (1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 920, 94 S. Ct. 1421, 39 L. Ed. 2d 475, 
prevent Schmidt from terminating Cicione without good cause.  This Court has previously rejected this rationale, North Penn Oil 
& Tire Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 371 F. Supp. 676 (E.D. Pa. 1974), by pointing out that Shell Oil Co. v. Marinello interpreted 
the public policy underlying the recently enacted New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, which is not the law of Pennsylvania.  The 
decision of the Third Circuit in Mariniello v. Shell Oil Co. does not affect our holding in North Penn."

paragraphs 7 and 9; pg. 3, paragraph 14. "
361,14," The Pennsylvania Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-431(b), provides in part: When a Pennsylvania manufacturer of malt or brewed beverages licensed under this article names or constitutes a 
distributor or importing distributor as the primary or original supplier of his product, he shall also designate the specific 
geographical area for which the said distributor or importing distributor is given distributing rights, and such distributor or 
importing distributor shall not sell or deliver the products of such manufacturer to any person issued a license under the 
provisions of this act whose licensed premises are not located within the geographical area for which distributing rights 
have been given to the distributor and importing distributor by the said manufacturer: Provided, That the importing 
distributor holding such distributing rights for such product shall not sell or deliver the same to another importing distributor 
without first having entered into a written agreement with the said secondary importing distributor setting forth the terms and 
conditions under which such products are to be resold within the territory granted to the primary importing distributor by the 
manufacturer. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any manufacturer from authorizing the importing 
distributor holding the distributing rights for a designated geographical area from selling the products of such manufacturer 
to another importing distributor also holding distributing rights from the same manufacturer for another geographical area, 
providing such authority be contained in writing and a copy thereof be given to each of the importing distributors so 
affected."
361,15, See stipulated facts.
361,16," Schmidt urges as an additional basis in support of its motion for summary judgment, that Cicione's active participation in the 
territorial restrictions bars its claim.  However, since we have ruled that the territorial restraints entered into pursuant to the 
Pennsylvania Liquor Code were valid under the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not necessary to discuss the merits of this 
argument. "
362,17," It is unclear whether Cicione has charged Schmidt with fixing maximum resale prices or with dictating the exact price at which 
Cicione was required to sell.  However, even if Schmidt's conduct is viewed as the fixing of maximum prices, it would still fall 
within the meaning of the word ""stipulated"".  See Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distiller Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 388, 71 S. Ct. 
745, 95 L. Ed. 1035 (1951); Graham v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 233 F. Supp. 825, 830-831 (E.D. Pa. 1964), aff'd per curiam,

362,18," See United States v. Revlon, Inc., 1975-1 TRADES CASES P 60,202 (S.D.N.Y. 1975), p. 65, 727, where the Court said: As to retailers, sold by Revlon direct, Revlon did have a definite practice and policy to require resale price maintenance in 
those states with fair trade laws.  Revlon insisted on fair trade agreements, oral or written (but nearly always written, in one 
form or another) before it would sell to retailers in those states.  Such a policy is not unlawful under the Sherman Act."
362,19," Cicione appears to place reliance upon two recent decisions, Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolf Coors Co., 506 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 
1975) and Adolf Coors Company v. F.T.C., 497 F.2d 1178 (10th Cir. 1974). In both cases, the same factual background led to 
similar Sherman Act charges being brought against Adolf Coors Company (""Coors""), a beer manufacturer. However, Cicione 
does not specify precisely how these two decisions are applicable to the case at bar.  Although the Coors cases and the instant 
case both involve Sherman Act charges that were brought against beer manufacturers, we find that they are readily 
distinguishable and do not support any of Cicione's allegations.  In Copper, a retail liquor store owner whose supply of ""Coors"" 
was cut off by a Coors distributor claimed that Coors conspired with distributors in its eleven-state marketing area to fix the retail "
363,," price of ""Coors"".  In retaliation for plaintiff's selling below Coors' suggested prices, Coors allegedly caused its distributor to 
discontinue supplying ""Coors"" to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff also alleged that Coors conspired with its distributors to create and 
enforce exclusive territories, thereby making it impossible for plaintiff to obtain a supply of Coors beer from another distributor. 
With respect to the issues of price fixing and territorial restraints, Coors did not assert that any state law insulated it from the 
prohibitions of the Sherman Act. Contrariwise, the basis for Schmidt's motion for summary judgment on the price fixing charge is 
its compliance with the Pennsylvania Fair Trade Act, together with Cicione's testimony that it would have lost business if it had 
tried to charge a higher price for Schmidt's beer, (see n. 20, supra), and on the territorial restraints charge, the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Code, which requires territorial restrictions."
363,20," See deposition of Joseph Cicione, pgs. 295-297; pg. 348. Q.  I recognize your testimony that Mr. Arenschield is supposed to have told you that these were prices you must sell at, but let's 
leave that aside.  Suppose he had not said that and assume that -- as I believe the case to be -- you were entitled to sell and 
free to sell at any price you wanted.  Would you have charged more than those prices on the schedule there A.  I don't think I would, in view of the fact that if I did, I would be selling higher than Piel's and Schaefer and I would lose some 
of the business. Q.  You couldn't get away with that, could you? A.  No, I couldn't get away with it. Q.  Is that true, by and large, of all the resale prices you sold at through the years?  You have to meet your competition? A.  With the best we can compete with them, we try to yes. Q.  So that you could not have increased your prices if you wanted to, in view of the competition from Piel's and Ballantine and 
Schaefer? A.  Under the structure, under this setup, I don't see where we could. Q.  I mean just in the free and open competition of the marketplace.  Didn't you have to meet the competition of those other 
brands?A.  Yes."
363,*," * * Q.  So that under any circumstances the prices that you charged throughout this period that we are talking about -- 1969 through 
1974 -- were fixed by competition, weren't they? A.  To a certain extent.  We tried to -- Q.  (Interposing) Could you have charged more than your competition? A.  Questionable.  I don't know if I could and get away with it.  I could have, but if I would have got away with it, I don't know.Q.  
You might have lost business?A.  I might have lost some business."
363,*," * * Q.  Wouldn't it be true that if you tried to charge more for Schmidts that you would have then lost business of Schmidt's beer? A.  Yes, it would be true."
363,21," See Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corporation, 514 F.2d 690, 694 (5th Cir. 1975), where, in a similar case, the Court said: 
""Kestenbaum submits that although it is true that he would have stayed competitive with popular brands even without a directive 
from Falstaff, when Falstaff's requirement that he do so was coupled with its taking of one-half of all additional revenue from his 
price increases on retail accounts, a situation was created in which he was not free to realize the percentage of profit that could "
364,," have been attained absent this requirement . . . . A prerequisite to Kestenbaum's recovery on this issue was a showing that the 
price ceiling on sales by him, disregarding the price charged to him, caused injury.  Not only did he fail to prove this, he 
established that the wholesale price which Falstaff allegedly fixed was a proper price. "

(C.A.5, 1974), the Fifth Circuit held that there was no right to unlicensed lay counsel, especially where the Defendant had twice 
rejected competent Court-appointed counsel.  The Fifth Circuit did not cite any authority in support of its holding.  In Guajardo v. 
Luna, 432 F.2d 1324 (C.A.5, 1970), a prisoner sought to file a civil suit on behalf of his father, an illiterate who was not in prison.  
The State Court refused to accept the suit on the ground that only licensed attorneys were allowed to file suit.  The prisoner then 
sought a declaratory judgment from Federal District Court that the Constitution guaranteed him the right to file suit on behalf of 
his father.  The District Court denied relief.  On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that there was no Constitutional guarantee that a 
non-attorney may represent other people in litigation.  As in United States v. Cooper, no authority was cited."

before pleading. 1 Pollock & Maitland, History of English Law 211 (1909).  Similarly, the first 'attorneys' were personal 
agents, often lacking any professional training, who were appointed by those litigants who had secured royal permission to 
carry on their affairs through a representative, rather than personally.  Id., at 212-213."" Note, however, that permission of the Crown was still needed.  As is apparent from the aforecited English statutes, the

discussion of the exception see Comment, Exceptions to Schwinn's Per Se Rule: Their Validity and Implications for the Future, 
31 Wash. & Lee L.Rev. 643 (1974). "
406,14," This exception has not been universally accepted. See U.S.  v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 302 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C., 1969), rev'd on 
other grounds, 410 U.S. 52, 93 S. Ct. 861, 35 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1973), applying the Schwinn per se rule in the face of an identical 
argument. "
407,15," The business is discussed in Comment, Trading Stamps, 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1090 (1962)."
407,16," Our conclusion is bolstered by evidence below indicating that S & H has at times deviated from its generally applied resale 
restrictions. Near the airport involved more than one gasoline service station in the same neighborhood has been licensed to 
distribute Green Stamps. S & H made no showing that the sale of stamps to those stations resulted in significantly smaller 
revenues."

1866. The ""ancient rule"" apparently derived by deduction from a given concept of property rights, alienability being one such 
right and its withholding inconsistent with a ""sale,"" and perhaps in part from Quia Emptores' purpose to deter subinfeudation and 
so conserve the prerogatives of the great feudal magnates. The Sherman Act seems to rest on somewhat different bases."
408,3," Our opinion in Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 506 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1975) merely takes a very literal interpretation of 
Schwinn when vertical restrictions are coupled with price fixing; it does not foreclose such a treatment of Schwinn.  Id. at 941-45."

408,5," 372 U.S. 253, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963). It is possible to view Schwinn as a mere application of White Motors to a 
particular situation where the economics are plain, with others to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Indeed it is tempting to 
do so, for so we are rescued from attempts to compare bicycles with trading stamps, credit cards, etc.  But the Court's language 
probably indicates an intent to sweep more broadly than this. "

to the public prior to the date of the original complaint herein and was a trade secret of plaintiff;"" ""12-(a).  On information and belief, IBM aided and abetted by Koretzky has, since the grant of the - 059 patent, continuously 
used and exploited the property of M&T which at the time of filing the original complaint herein was a trade secret of M&T.  
Further, on information and belief, the - 059 patent was and continues to be part of a licensing program of IBM by which IBM 
derives substantial income to the detriment of M&T."""
423,4," Plaintiff alternatively argues that even if the tort is not a continuing one, then the provisions of CPLR § 203(f) should apply to 
permit an action to be commenced within two years after the actual or imputed discovery of facts which show that a cause of 
action has accrued.  It argues that the relevant date would then be 1973, when the - 059 patent first came to its attention.  A 
similar argument was rejected in Gerber v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 64 Misc. 2d 687, 689, 315 N.Y.S.2d 601, 603 
(Civil Ct. 1970), where the court stated: "". . . the Court of Appeals has noted that HN5[
] it is 'unquestionable' that the Statute of Limitations in conversion actions is not 
tolled by mere ignorance or lack of discovery of the wrong.  Unless the statute itself expressly provides that the cause of action 
does not accrue until the facts are discovered, such as in cases of fraud or breach of prospective warranty, the statutory period 
begins to run from the time of the wrong even though the injured party had no knowledge of its existence. . . . ""The discovery accrual provision of subdivision (f) of CPLR Sec. 203 is of no avail to the plaintiff, since it only comes into 
operation in a case where the applicable Statute of Limitations runs from discovery, actual or imputed; it is not intended to create 
a new standard of measure. . . ."" Moreover, plaintiff had imputed knowledge of its cause of action on November 21, 1967, when the patent was issued.  
""'Issuance HN6[
] of a patent and recordation in the Patent Office constitutes notice to the world of its existence.'"" Hartley Pen Co. v. Lindy Pen Co., 16 F.R.D. 141, 157 (S.D.Cal.1954), aff'd sub nom., Kimberly Corp. v. Hartley Pen Co., 237 F.2d 294, 304

Newell v. West, 18 Fed.Cas.No.10,150, p. 50 (C.C.N.D.N.Y.1875).  Plaintiff thus had imputed knowledge of the patent's 
existence, the subject matter it covered, the fact that Koretzky was the inventor, and IBM's record title to the patent more than 
two years before it filed this suit. "

Even the former figure, however, would be unreasonably high for an association in which approximately half of the contractors 
pay premiums under $5,000. See note 10 supra. Plaintiffs interpret Oda's testimony, Deposition, Feb. 27, 1975, at 97, to mean that the bid was rejected because it required a free 
choice of insurance agent by the insured and therefore did not conform to the bid request. Aside from the fact that Oda had no 
knowledge why the proposal was rejected, White's testimony on the point explains the reason and he was in charge of the 
process. In addition, the bid proposal did not specify that there could be no free choice of insurance agent, see Doc. 221-22,

433,38," The Court can only speculate on their reasons. Perhaps they believed that the group plan violated the antitrust or insurance 
laws, whether it was open or closed. Perhaps they did not want to become agents for INA/PEIC (although INA indicated that 
even that wasn't necessary; they could deal through Yamada, see Doc. 1117-18). Many plaintiffs certainly believed that the plan 
was closed, and that they were precluded from writing insurance. See, e.g., Doc. 2438, 1128-32. This was one of many 
misconceptions about the intentions of the IBEW and PECA. See, e.g., Doc. 1128-32. The Court regrets the extent to which lack 
of communication among the parties may have led to this litigation, and hopes that this note will help others in the future to avoid 
the same mistake. "

434,40, Plaintiffs' Opening Brief 24.
434,41," The sale of workmen's compensation insurance in Hawaii by Oda or any of the plaintiffs at times relevant to this suit is an 
integral part of an interstate transaction because the insurer is a California corporation. The Supreme Court ""has long held that 
'there is an obvious distinction to be drawn between a course of conduct wholly within a state and conduct which is an 
inseparable element of a larger program dependent for its success upon activity which affects commerce between the states.'""

United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, 324 U.S. 293, 297, 89 L. Ed. 951, 65 S. Ct. 661 (1945). Since a taxi trip between stations to change trains as part of an interstate journey has been held to be in the stream of 
commerce for Sherman Act purposes, see United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 228-29, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 
1560 (1947), it follows that intrastate competition for the sale of interstate insurance policies is within the reach of federal 
antitrust law."
434,42," ""It is often said that the concerted refusal to deal -- or its evil-sounding equivalent, 'boycott' -- is unlawful per se. But there may 
be restraints with some boycott characteristics that are not or should not be automatically unlawful. . . . Indeed, one might even 
hold that any agreement affecting competitive behavior is necessarily an agreement that the collaborators will not buy or sell on 
any other terms; and there is no sharp logical distinction between refusing to sell at all and refusing to sell except on condition."" 
P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 287 (1967). "
435,43," Plaintiffs first theory would probably be equally applicable to the several hundred group plans described in note 9 supra, but 
plaintiffs have not cited any holding that a similar plan violates the antitrust laws. Plaintiffs lay great emphasis on the fact that Article 19 requires all contractors to participate in the group plan, but they have not 
demonstrated the legal significance of this fact with respect to per se violations. It neither increases nor diminishes the strength 
of plaintiffs' boycott argument because the targets of the requirement to place insurance with the winning bidder are not antitrust 
boycott victims. The contractors who may be required by their collective bargaining agreement to deal with INA/PEIC ""against 
their wishes"" are ""victims,"" if at all, of majority rule and American labor policy."

] A distinction is to be drawn between the assignment of a party's rights under a contract and a delegation of the party's 
duties. Madison Pictures, Inc. v. Chesapeake Inds., Inc., 147 N.Y.S.2d 50, 57 (Sup. Ct. 1955); Williston, Contracts § 407 (3d ed. 
1940). Technically, a party's duties cannot be delegated to another without the consent of the obligee. Unfortunately, attorneys 
do not always utilize the skills of contract draftsmanship required by the subtle distinction and ""assignment"" has often been "
449,," inartfully used to encompass both assignment of rights and delegation of duties. See J. Calamari & J. Perillo, Contracts § 254 
(1970); Corbin, Assignment of Contract Rights, 74 U. Pa. L. Rev. 207 (1926)."
449,7," In Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U.S. 540, 46 L. Ed. 679, 22 S. Ct. 431 (1902), defendants argued that they were not 
liable on promissory notes given for the price of pipe because the seller had previously combined with other manufacturers of 
pipe to establish and control prices. The Court held that there was no necessary legal connection between the sale of goods to 
defendants and the allegedly illegal arrangement made by plaintiff with other pipe manufacturers. The contracts under which the 
notes had been given were deemed to be ""collateral"" to the combination and would not support a defense to paying for what 
defendants had received. The Supreme Court also rejected an antitrust defense in D. R. Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corn Products Refining Co., 236 U.S. 165, 59 
L. Ed. 520, 35 S. Ct. 398 (1915). In that case, defendant sought to avoid paying the purchase price for glucose by contending 
that the contract had been executed pursuant to an illegal exclusive dealing arrangement. The Court held that liability on the sale 
was distinct from the question of illegal combination notwithstanding the possibility that a wrongdoer might receive some ""indirect 
benefit"" or ""remote aide"" from enforcement of the contract. The Court observed that the contract was not so ""inherently"" or 
""intrinsically"" illegal as to require courts to refuse to enforce it for fear of compelling a wrongful act. See also A. B. Small Co. v. 
Lamborn & Co., 267 U.S. 248, 252, 69 L. Ed. 597, 45 S. Ct. 300 (1925). In Bruce's Juices v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743, 91 L. Ed. 1219, 67 S. Ct. 1015 (1947), a purchaser of cans contended that 
promissory notes that it had executed were void because they were given for goods purchased at discriminatory prices in 
violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13, 13a. The Court analyzed the purpose of the antitrust statutes, the intent 
of the drafters of those statutes, and the functions to be served by avoiding enforcement of illegal contracts. The Court 
concluded that, in the absence of an intrinsically illegal contract that would be ""consummated by the judgment sought,"" it would 
not judicially supplement explicit statutory remedies for antitrust violations."
449,8," Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U.S. 540, 551, 46 L. Ed. 679, 22 S. Ct. 431 (1902). "
450,9," This proposition has been questioned on the ground that the purchase that was the subject of the suit probably would not have 
been made but for the plaintiff's promise of non-delivery. See Comment, The Defense of Antitrust Illegality in Contract Actions, 
27 U. Chi. L. Rev. 758, 765 (1960)."
450,10," The Court in Kelly was obviously unwilling to consider any of the background of the transaction before it. See note 9 supra. 
See also 368 F. Supp. at 1278."
450,11," Lower courts have seized upon this rationale in determining whether to entertain an antitrust defense to a contract action. 
Thus, in Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., 340 F.2d 753, 768-69 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 820, 15 L. Ed. 2d 66, 86 "
451,," S. Ct. 47 (1965), the Sixth Circuit allowed defendant to prove that a contract it had breached was a tying arrangement in 
violation of the Sherman Act. The court refused to enforce the contract, which required payment by a defunct newspaper of the 
purchase price of unwanted and unnecessary future services from Associated Press. In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Malco 
Petroleum, Inc., 471 F.2d 1258 (6th Cir. 1972), however, the same court distinguished Associated Press as a case involving an 
executory contract; the court refused to allow defendant to avoid payment on a promissory note that was allegedly given in 
furtherance of an illegal tying arrangement and for which defendant had received $200,000. Cf.  Medusa Corp. v. Gordon, 496 
F.2d 249 (6th Cir. 1974); Lewis v. Seanor Coal Co., 382 F.2d 437, 441 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 947, 19 L. Ed. 2d

457,1," .  When the above-mentioned provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act were reported to the Senate floor, the Commerce 
Committee reported the bill with an amendment which would have extended the Commission's jurisdiction over motor carrier 
rates, to be coextensive with the ICC'S jurisdiction over intrastate railroad rates, as set forth in the Shreveport Rate Case, 
(Houston, East and West Texas Railway Co. v. United States) 234 U.S. 342, 34 S.Ct. 833, 58 L.Ed. 1341 (1913). That case held 
that the Commission could cancel intrastate railroad rates when it found that those rates substantially affected interstate railroad 
rates in a discriminatory manner.  That portion of the bill was expunged before being passed by the Senate.  When the House 
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce reported the bill, it amended it to prohibit 'the extension of federal regulation in 
intrastate transportation that was exercised under the authority of the decision of the Supreme Court in the 'Shreveport' Case 
and of the provisions of Section 13(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act.' See H.R.Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1935); 
74 Cong.Rec. 12204-279 (July 31, 1935)."
457,2," .  The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is intended to apply primarily to cases in which the court has jurisdiction to grant a remedy 
upon the proof of the facts alleged, but the issues are such as fall within the special competence or 'expertise' of an 
administrative agency in some field where uniformity of statutory policy or interpretation is desirable.  Marnell v. United Parcel 
Service of America, Inc., 260 F.Supp. 391, 413 (N.D. Cal.1966); United States v. Western Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. 59, 77 S.Ct. 161, 
1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956) (question of reasonableness of rates); General American Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal Co., 308 
U.S. 422, 60 S.Ct. 325, 84 L.Ed. 361 (1940) (deferred to agency factual question of 'reasonableness of rates').  In such a case 
the judicial process is usually stayed pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.  The doctrine of "
458,," primary jurisdiction is, however, inapplicable when the question is not one of fact requiring the fact-finding expertise of a federal 
agency, but rather one of law.  Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., Inc., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S.Ct. 1596, 14 L.Ed2d 640 (1965). In the 
instant case, the questions before the court is solely legal, i.e., whether the fixing of intrastate rates and anti-competitive conduct 
fall within the ambit of immunity under SMCRC'S 5a agreement.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to refer the issue to the ICC, 
since the Interstate Commerce Act makes it clear that the Commission has no regulatory authority over intrastate rate-making of 
motor carriers. "
459,3," .  An affidavit attached to the motion to compel production of documents indicates that it has received documentary evidence in 
another Grand Jury investigation of the motor carrier industry and specific complaints regarding possible violations of the federal 
antitrust laws by SMCRC. "
466,1," As would be expected, the statutes of Pennsylvania and Virginia which control the establishment of insurance rates require that 
the cost of paying claims be reflected in level of premiums to be charged. 40 Pa. Stat. § 1183(a); Va. Code, § 38.1-252(3)

467,2," For what significance it may have, this matter was settled between the parties without appeal. "
475,1," Ford Marketing Corporation was incorporated in 1970, and commencing in July 1970 was responsible for the marketing of 
Ford, Mercury and Lincoln automobiles and related products. Prior to July 1970 this marketing function had been performed by 
the manufacturer, Ford Motor Company. It appears that subsequent to the trial of this action Ford Marketing Corporation was 
dissolved, and the marketing function was returned to Ford Motor Company. For the purposes of this case, defendants Ford 
Motor Company and Ford Marketing Corporation will usually be treated as a single entity, and will be referred to as ""Ford""."
475,2," For purposes of simplicity, in this opinion I will refer to franchised Ford, Mercury and Lincoln dealers as ""Ford dealers"". "
476,3," It appears that prior to 1968 the amount of the allowance used in calculating the dealer price was 42%, and that commencing in 
1968 the amount of this allowance was 40%. "
477,," There were certain other discounts or allowances granted, under certain circumstances, to dealers in connection with the 
purchase of crash parts. FLM makes claims for damages based on certain allegations of inability to obtain these allowances. 
These claims will be discussed in the supplemental opinion regarding damages. "
480,4," This is a restated figure, deducting from the cost of parts the amount of $21,897.00 wholesale incentive allowance settled in 
fiscal 1973 and applicable to 1972. "
483,5," FLM contends, not only that Ford withdrew the wholesale incentive allowance, but that Ford directed Atlas to completely cease 
doing business with FLM. I reject FLM's contention on the latter point. The Ford witnesses deny that any such direction was 
given, and I credit this denial. "

] Section 2(a) has been held to apply to competitive injury occurring where the competitors are on different functional levels of distribution.  Purolator Products, Inc., 65 F.T.C. 8 (1964), aff'd, 352 F.2d 874 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 
1045, 19 L. Ed. 2d 837, 88 S. Ct. 758 (1968). There the Commission found a competitive injury covered by Section 2(a), where 
jobbers competed with wholesale dealers from whom the jobbers purchased goods. The facts in Purolator were substantially 
different from the facts presented in the present case, and resort was had in Purolator to the ""indirect purchaser"" doctrine, which, 
for reasons described hereafter, I hold inapplicable to the present case. However, Purolator does illustrate the point that Section 
2(a) can be applied, in an appropriate case, to a competitive injury where the competitors are not on the same functional level. In United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 1321 (1966), to be described more fully later 
in this opinion, the Supreme Court found a Sherman Act violation where General Motors combined with certain of its Chevrolet 
dealers to prevent other Chevrolet dealers from selling to discount houses, thereby preventing the discount houses from 
competing with dealers. "

an injury to a competitor is sufficient proof of injury to competition.  F.T.C. v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 49, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 
S. Ct. 822 (1948). "
505,1," Defendants contend that Saxer should not be allowed to act as both class representative and as one of the attorneys for the 
class.  This contention lacks merit inasmuch as the court in Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., 67 Cal.2d 695 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 
732], implicitly sanctioned such dual representation."
505,2," The Cartwright Act provides in part: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the 
following purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  . . .  (c) To prevent competition in 
manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.  . . .  (e) To make or enter 
into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any or 
any combination of any of the following: . . .  (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may 
have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."" 
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16720.) Section 16702 of the Business and Professions Code defines ""persons"" as "". . . corporations, firms, partnerships and 
associations existing under or authorized by the laws of this State or any other State, or any foreign country."" Section 16726 of the Business and Professions Code states: ""Except as provided [herein] . . . , every trust is unlawful, against 
public policy and void."" "
506,3," Saxer initially argues that section 16756 of the Business and Professions Code outlines the pleading requirements for a 
Cartwright Act violation in a civil action.  However, this contention was considered and rejected in Chicago Title, supra, 69 Cal.2d

] While both section 1 of the Sherman Act and sections 16720 and 16726 of the Cartwright Act purport to prohibit all restraints on trade, each has been interpreted to permit restraints found to be reasonable.  ( Standard Oil Co. v. United States,

there was no evidence about which lines of commerce were substantially affected by Pitchford's inability to handle them. Under

564,1," The complaint in this action initially alleged six causes of action, in three sets of pairs -- (1) price discrimination in the first and 
second causes of action; (2) vertical price fixing in the third and fourth causes of action; and (3) tie-in sales in the fifth and sixth 
causes of action. Injunctive relief was sought in the odd-numbered causes and the imposition of penalties in the even-numbered 
causes.  The oil company moved under CPLR 3211 (subd [a], par 7) to dismiss all six causes of action for failure to state a 
cause of action.  Supreme Court granted the motion as to the third and fourth causes (vertical price fixing) and denied it as to the 
other four causes.  The parties then cross-appealed to the Appellate Division.  Thereafter before argument the parties stipulated 
to withdraw all appeals before the Appellate Division except the oil company's appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss the 
first and second causes of action. Thus, there was considered at the Appellate Division and is now before us on this further 
appeal only the pair of causes of action alleging price discrimination. "

566,4," We find nothing in Columbia Gas of N. Y. v New York State Elec. & Gas Corp. (28 NY2d 117), which calls for a contrary 
disposition.  Because of the factor of utility rate regulation that case concededly did not involve price discrimination as such. The 
price discrimination there confronted was that in a particular factual setting, involving an abuse of monopoly power by a public 
utility within the proscription of section 65 of the Public Service Law. We do not denigrate the decision in Columbia Gas.  We 
merely acknowledge that its holding does not dictate the conclusion that subdivision 1 of section 340 of the General Business 
Law must be stretched to embrace the nonreciprocal, unilateral practice alleged in the present case. "
568,*," As I interpret the majority opinion, one might conclude that the affirmative defenses in the Robinson-Patman Act have 
negatived the general rule that price discrimination is prohibited.  With this I cannot agree.  Such a theory overlooks the scheme 
of the statute itself which requires an alleged violator affirmatively to prove in a full-blown adversarial proceeding (and not on a 
motion to dismiss, as here) that the pricing policies were justifiable.  Notably, the act was designed to limit the scope of the then 
extant affirmative defense and to strengthen price discrimination prohibitions ( Federal Trade Comm. v Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 
505, 516; see, generally, Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act, pp 3-24). "

592,6," We recognize that Pan Am's claim is phrased in terms of Hefler's being liable to Pan Am for chargebacks which Pan Am owes

under the terms of its credit agreement with Pan Am, to hold Pan Am liable when American Express had paid out money on 
unauthorized credit card purchases. However, Pan Am will only suffer a loss if it has actually provided services but had been 
unpaid: thus we conclude Pan Am's claim is based upon direct injury to itself. "

622,1," An experience rating measures the safety record of employees over a period of time. REA claims that its employees enjoyed a 
better safety record than the employees of other railroads, which should have reduced the rates payable by REA."
622,2," REA finally withdrew as to these employees on June 1, 1972. "
623,3," Although the named plaintiff was the railroad, the Court stated that ""Amoskeag, the principal beneficiary of any recovery and 
itself estopped from complaining of petitioners' alleged wrongs, cannot avoid the command of equity through the guise of 
proceeding in the name of respondent corporation which it owns and controls."" 417 U.S. at 713. "
625,4," Although REA asserts that it has ""implicit authorization"" from the unions representing employees to sue on behalf of the 
employees, there is no binding agreement that REA use the money it would recover for the benefit of the employees. "
626,5," Pre-1969 creditors, to the extent that they had been wronged by actions of the REA board after entering into the credit 
arrangement with REA, might have a stronger interest if they were before this court. Whether a recovery would be appropriate 
even in that instance need not now be decided, since, as noted earlier, this is not a creditors' suit, and no pre-1969 creditors 
other than the railroad defendants have any interest in REA's assets."
626,6," Travelers and the conference defendants, of course, cannot be held liable, either, since the basis of Bangor Punta is avoidance 
of unjust enrichment, not deterrence of allegedly illegal or improper conduct. See 417 U.S. at 717. "
632,1," As amended in 1968, the provisions reads: ""If the Corporation finds that any former Participant (whether retired or whose employment has been voluntarily or involuntarily 
terminated) is engaged or employed, directly or indirectly, in any occupation or in a business, which in the opinion of the 
Corporation is in competition with or to the Employer, or injures or is detrimental to the business of the Employer, and if after 30 
days written notice, such former Participant continues to be engaged or employed, directly or indirectly, in such occupation, the 
Trustees shall cancel the benefits of such former Participant."""
632,2," The only federal antitrust question decided in Bradford was that the covenant not to compete and accompanying forfeiture 
clause did not constitute a per se violation. The court never reached the question of whether the covenant could afford the 
Sherman Act standard of reasonableness because it held that it was reasonable under state law. The opinion does not resolve 
whether an unreasonable covenant not to compete would be in violation of federal antitrust laws."
632,3," Defendant vigorously denies that the benefits had vested. Without deciding the question, I will assume for the purposes of this 
motion that the benefits are vested. "
633,4," Plaintiff also seeks to distinguish this case on the basis of the allegation that the forfeiture clause has been applied in a 
discriminatory fashion. If the forfeiture clause does not offend the antitrust laws in and of itself, the fact that it has not been 
enforced on every occasion adds nothing to the cause of action."
633,5," Defendant has, for reasons that remain unclear, interpreted this to be a reference to the Pension Reform Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 
1001, and proceeded to point out that the Act is not yet in effect with respect to this plan. In response, plaintiff, without making 
any reference to the Code, argues that the policies embodied in the Pension Act are applicable. This is all inapposite. "

expensive local live programming. "
654,5, See note 1 supra.
654,6," The microwave transmitter allowed Delta to pick up a network signal in Jackson and beam it to its station in Meridian.  This 
eliminated the need for AT&T long-lines service.  Delta was still required to pay AT&T charges for local-channel service to 
transport the signal from the AT&T switchboard to Delta's microwave transmitter, both located in Jackson, and station-
connection charges."
654,7," Central Television, Inc., (the assignee of Delta's license and presently the operator of WHTV as a satellite station) stated in its 
application to the FCC for Delta's license that Meridian ""is presently unable to sustain two viable full time television stations."" 
Although, the application was signed under penalty of federal law for false statements by F. Carrington Weems as President of 
Delta, Weems denies having read the statement before he signed it.  Because of this denial, the statement is not considered an 
admission on Weems' part for purposes of summary judgment. "

655,9," The importance of predicted audience was known to Delta at the outset.  The report which was commissioned by Walker 
opened with the statement that ""stations must be judged in terms of circulation provided to the advertiser."" In addition, this same 
report warned that the new station's audience would probably not attract a network with which to affiliate for the first 12 to 18 
months.  The report's affiliation warning proved accurate: Delta went on the air in June of 1968 and the NBC affiliation became 
effective July 1, 1969. "

343 U.S. 929, 72 S. Ct. 762, 96 L. Ed. 1339 (1952), in an attempt to show that it is alleging sufficient parallel action to withstand 
summary judgment. But, in that very case, after holding that an antitrust violation existed, the court required that ""the distributor . 
. . give plaintiff an equal opportunity with the operators of conventional theaters to bid for pictures on first run."" The court went on 
to say that the reason that parallel activity in Lowe's could be the basis for a finding of a conspiracy to restrain trade was that here we add that each distributor refuses to license features on first run to a drive-in even if the higher rental is offered.  
Each distributor has thus acted in apparent contradiction to his own self-interest. This strengthens considerably the 
inference of conspiracy . . .. Id. at 583 (emphasis added).  The roles of the purchaser and seller in Lowe's are reversed from the case presented by Delta, 
but the lesson is the same.  HN7[
] An inference of conspiracy or anticompetitive activity neither arises from a refusal to sell a 
product or service for less than it is worth nor from a refusal to buy a product or service for more than it is worth."
661,30," Delta alleges that the second coincidental survey performed during the summer or fall of 1969 by ARB showed 6,000 average 
prime-time viewing homes.  As discussed in Section I(B) of this opinion, supra, telephone coincidental surveys were treated by 
the industry as less reliable than regular surveys.  No regular independent survey showed Delta over ABC's 7,000 or NBC's 
6,000 average prime-time viewing homes minimum level for station compensation. "
662,31," In the research conducted by the networks, UHF conversion figures in the neighborhood of 30-40 percent were used.  The 
report commissioned by Walker before the Delta venture was begun estimated a conversion figure of 30-35 percent.  The 1970 
United States Census reports show, depending on the market definition used, the UHF conversion percentage of total television 
homes to be between 27.8 and 35.3. "
663,32," There are considerations aside from audience level which enter into any independent business decision regarding affiliation. 
Affiliation carries certain costs including constant communications between the station and network -- visits by network 
representatives, regular monitoring and analysis of the station promotional assistance and, when justified by the station's 
audience, the station's hourly rate.  In addition, a poorly run station also reflects badly upon the network since the network's logo 
is prominently displayed both by the station and in promotional campaigns.  We note this not to suggest that such considerations 
were applied to Delta but to say that adherence to a minimum threshold for affiliation is business justified."

666,42," Ever since the television tariff structure was established, the FCC has continually been involved in its investigation and 
examination.  The tariffs became effective May 1, 1948.  The FCC proceeding which originally examined these tariffs was docket 
No. 8963.  That proceeding remained before the FCC until May 18, 1960 when the FCC finally terminated its investigation.  The 
FCC adopted a policy of continuing surveillance and said that ""in the event the future developments make it desirable to 
investigate specific matters now encompassed herein"" the FCC would ""institute new proceedings regarding such matters."" 
Hughes Sports Network, Inc. v. AT&T, 25 FCC2d 560 (1970). Hughes Sports Network was an active participant in docket No. 
8963 and the issue of discrimination in the occasional-use vs. regular-use tariff structure was before the FCC in that proceeding.  
While docket No. 8963 was before the FCC, a study commission was appointed by it to report on television networks. This 
report, the Barrow report, was begun in 1955 and concluded in 1957.  Proceedings in docket No. 12782 were instituted in 1957 
after the filing of the Barrow report.  An additional study group was formed to report on television networks during this 
proceeding leading to the filing of the Bryant report on July 2, 1965 (an interim report was filed in 1960).  Hughes filed its action 
assailing the tariff structure June 3, 1965.  The Hearing Examiner and the FCC Review Board's affirmance ruled that the 
occasional-use vs. regular-use provisions of the tariff discriminated against Hughes.  Hughes Sports Network, Inc. v. AT&T, 25 
FCC2d 550, 560 (1970). The full FCC reversed and remanded, but only on the previous holding that Hughes was not entitled to 
damages.  34 FCC2d at 691. This issue was appealed to the Second Circuit, Cause No. 73-1216, but prior to briefing agreement 
was reached between AT&T and Hughes which disposed of the matter.  This kind of open, continual, active examination of the 
tariff structure argues forcefully against any possibility that conspiratorial activity marked the establishment of the tariffs."
666,43," AT&T's private line tariffs which cover telephone, telegraph, data transmission, document reproduction, and other 
communication services, all include the dual-point vs. multi-point ""dilemma."" AT&T asserts that it provides approximately 
137,000 interexchange (long-lines) services to about 8,000 customers -- approximately 9,000 of these services to about 1,400 
customers involve multi-point service.  Multipoint service to ABC, CBS and NBC constitute less than 10% of the various private 
line services that AT&T provides to all of its customers.  These provisions (multi-point vs. dual-point) have been involved in 
private line service tariffs since at least 1934."

668,52," In the order of February 11, 1972, this court ruled: This issue came on to be heard on various motions filed by certain of the counter-defendants herein, and at the outset of 
the hearing, the Court raised on its own motion the question of the necessity of referring this case to the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, as enunciated in the case of Carter v. AT&T 
(C.A. 5, Tex.), 365 F.2d 486 (1966). This issue had previously been raised by a motion filed by counter-defendant American Telephone and Telegraph 
Company (AT&T) to the original Counterclaim filed herein by Delta Communications Corporation (Delta).  Said 
Counterclaim was thereafter amended, and at a hearing held in this cause on January 14, 1972, counsel for Delta advised 
the Court that the Amended Counterclaim raised no issue as to the validity of AT&T's interstate tariffs on file with the FCC, 
but raised issues only as to the application of said tariffs. The Court therefore treated the present hearing as an informal pretrial conference and discussed said question with 
counsel for Delta and AT&T.  Counsel for Delta again advised the Court that the Amended Counterclaim does not raise any 
issue as to the validity of said tariffs but that it does raise issues as to their applications. "
669,," The Court therefore finds and adjudicates that it has been conclusively established that there is no issue involved in this 
case concerning the validity of said tariffs and that there is, therefore, no necessity for referring this case at this time to the 
FCC for preliminary determination of the validity of said tariffs, in accordance with the decision in Carter v. AT&T. The Court further finds that it has jurisdiction to try the issues raised by the pleadings herein.  (Emphasis added). This order of February 11, 1972, was reconfirmed by this court's orders of May 30, 1972, and March 1, 1973.  Thus, in its order 
of March 1, 1973, this court ruled in paragraph 2(c): c.  Without modifying or limiting any prior Orders of this Court, interrogation at such depositions concerning any claim or 
allegation of Delta Communications Corporation as to the tariffs of American Telephone and Telegraph Company shall be 
limited to the subject matter of any misapplication of such tariffs or application of them in a discriminatory manner."
669,53,"  The best illustration is to accept momentarily the concession of appellants that the tariff is authoritatively held to be valid 
administratively for regulatory purposes, to which they add, but not valid for antitrust purposes.  We can recognize, of 
course, that in this some time weird antitrust world, in which antitrust policies appear to have an overpowering influence in 
the running clash between supposedly coordinate executive agencies or departments of the same government, cf.  
California v. FPC, 1962, 369 U.S. 482, 82 S. Ct. 901, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54, it is possible for the Courts to hold finally that this 
result could occur.  But that choice ought not to be made, the occasion for facing such a possibility ought not to be forced 
until it is inescapably necessary.  The very difficulties inherent in that prospect demonstrate that. . . . If, as the law clearly 
permits, the monopolistic and antitrust implications of the practices compelled by the tariff were among the factors 
considered and evaluated by the FCC, a Court would be hard put in either contriving or thereafter verbalizing a concept 
which, in a sort of now-you-see-it, now-you-don't sleight of hand, would allow the tariff to be valid and yet invalid at one and 
the same time. Carter v. AT&T, 365 F.2d 486, 495-96 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1008, 17 L. Ed. 2d 546, 87 S. Ct. 714 (1967)."

prime-time programs Delta was unable to broadcast because Southern was preempting the best of all programming. Under the 
facts shown, however, the first group makes the strongest case for an increase in ABC programming by Southern."
677,76," Although summary judgment standards require the court to assume WDAM exerted the alleged pressure on NBC, that 
assumption does not require the inference that it did so in furtherance of a scheme to preserve Southern's Meridian monopoly.

678,77," The fact that ABC usually paid AT&T delivery charges for its programs to Southern while NBC did not accentuates this 
reasonableness. "
679,78," In examining this assertion we note the following factors already reviewed: First, too few hours were involved in Southern's 
portion of the conspiracy to allow an inference that it actually existed; only three NBC programs were cancelled, two because 
NBC no longer produced them and one because NBC would not allow Southern to show it.  Second, the effect of the asserted 
WDAM pressure was a failure; NBC gave Delta seven programs at the start of the new season and in less than a year it had 
granted Delta a first-call affiliation with the network."

said to be to assist Southern in eliminating Delta as competition.  See note 76, supra."

Sherman Act, but withdrew them because it was agreed that the tying item here, the Dunkin' Donuts trademark, franchise 
system and logo, was not ""goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities"" as required by Section 3. 
The district court decided, however, that the trademark, system and logo did constitute a separate tying product sufficient for 
purposes of the Sherman Act. We do not consider that decision an obvious one. See, e.g., Redd. v. Shell Oil Co., 524 F.2d 1054

similar in substance to the case at bar, but Siegel did not present for decision the particular narrow issue presented by this 
interlocutory appeal. There, the Chicken Delight franchisees, unlike the Dunkin' Donuts franchisees here, relied on the express 
terms of the standard form Chicken Delight franchise agreement as imposing an allegedly illegal tie-in; the franchise agreement -
- common to all the franchisees -- provided, in the district judge's view, the ""integral core"" of the complaint for purposes of 
determining whether common or individual questions predominated.  271 F. Supp. at 726. More significantly, the district court 
there did not premise its finding of predominant common issues on a rejection of the doctrine of individual coercion; nor did it 
certify a § 1292(b) interlocutory appeal on the propriety of that rejection. The district court here did both. This interlocutory appeal thus presents a narrow legal question: whether this class certification, 
expressly premised on rejection of the doctrine of individual coercion, was proper. Because Siegel did not present the narrow 
class certification issue presented by this interlocutory appeal, we have no occasion at this time to decide definitively whether 
Siegel, in its several aspects, ought to be favorably regarded in this circuit. Suffice it to say, the matter is not free from doubt.

713,10," Concerning the damages to the franchisees in Siegel, supra, n.5, Professor Areeda asks the following troublesome questions: (1) How can the value of the franchise be rationally determined except by reference to what franchisees have demonstrated 
a willingness to pay? (2) Why must there be a recovery by the tie-in purchaser who was not in fact injured by the form in 
which the franchisor chose to take his reward? To be sure, that form may be challenged by society in order to maximize 
competition on the merits in the tied products, but query whether that is sufficient reason to award a windfall to an uninjured 
franchisee. Denying damages would mean, of course, that the franchisee would not sue the ""wrongdoer"". Should such a result be 
considered desirable? Whenever a legal rule condemns conduct regardless of significant effects, society may need a 
mechanism for disregarding the trivial. De minimis rules are one way, but they may complicate inquiries unnecessarily. 
Prosecutive discretion is another route: the Government will usually ignore the trivial. And, of course, the suppliers of the 
tied products can sue for an injunction, if not for damages, when a tie seems significant to them. The franchisee, on the 
other hand, may sue for the treble damage windfall allowed by the district court regardless of the significance of the 
restraint and notwithstanding the fact that he paid no more than he would have paid in the form of a franchise fee. P. AREEDA, ANTITRUST ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, TEXT, CASES para. 554, at 617 (2d ed. 1974). Concerning the effects of the holding in Siegel, a law review commentator makes the following observations: By being overly zealous in striking down tie-ins under section 1 of the Sherman Act, courts may inadvertently cause vertical 
integration and thus destroy the advantage of ""enabling numerous groups of individuals with small capital to become 
entrepreneurs."" Therefore, courts should balance the coercive effect of tie-ins on the franchisee with the benefit he derives 
from the franchise form of doing business. In no case should they lose sight of the economic realities of franchising 
including the necessity that the franchisor receive adequate compensation for the license of his trademark.  "

714,12," In granting summary judgment for Dunkin' Donuts in E.B.E., Inc. v. Dunkin' Donuts, Inc., supra, n.7, the district court 
emphasized the attractiveness of the package deal to the franchisee. From the record established to date in this matter, one theme is consistently evident: Plaintiff sought and desired a 
packaged, ready-to-go business operation. The plaintiff's officers, Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, were perfectly willing to rely on 
defendants' services in assembling the business package, and it never occurred to them to do otherwise. It was defendants' 
ability to deliver such a package that was attractive to the plaintiff. Far from claiming that she and her husband were forced 
to accept the equipment, the property lease and the signs as a condition for obtaining the franchise, Mrs. Edwards asserts 
merely that it was never affirmatively impressed upon them that they could buy from other sources.  "

distinguished titles. The truth is that we are all sinners; nobody's record is clean; and indeed it is only fair to say that much of the 
very texture of the law invites us to sin, for it so often holds out to us, as though they were objective standards, terms like 
'reasonable care,' 'due notice,' 'reasonable restraint,' which are no more than signals that the dispute is to be decided with 
moderation and without disregard of any of the interests at stake. So inveterate is the disposition to eschew all deduction in such 
cases, that some ironist might argue that, given the average judicial capacity for self-scrutiny, it is safer not to expose the springs 
of decision, because the chances of a right result are greater than that its support will endure disclosure. Perhaps so; maybe, for

instructed to refrain from selling to banana growers (Finding of Fact 216); and that purchasers used the property to grow cotton 
and not bananas because of agronomic and economic advantages (no blowdowns, no Panama disease, the availability of truck 
transportation rather than rail) and the Guatemalan government's encouragement of cotton growing (Finding of Fact 218) as well 
as its opposition to banana growing (Finding of Fact 220). While there was a finding that a few leases did preclude banana 
production, the court below also found that this was not a ""general policy"" and in fact the weight of the evidence was to show 
that UF sold the land generally without restriction."
728,25," That decree provided in pertinent part that ""United shall sell to an Eligible Person (as hereinafter defined) production and 
transportation assets . . . including producing banana lands or producing banana lands and banana purchase arrangements, 
ships, and other essential accessory assets, reasonably calculated to be capable of importing annually into the East Coast, Gulf 
Coast and/or West Coast ports of the United States approximately 9,000,000 stems of bananas per year . . . ."" As already noted, 
the term ""Eligible Person"" specifically excluded Standard Fruit, then UF's chief competitor. However, the Justice Department 
expressed some misgivings about whether a sale of Tiquisate to Chalk would comply with the consent decree. Finding of Fact 
241. "
729,26," Appellant argues that the court below committed ""clear error"" when in its opinion it stated that Chalk ""apparently wanted to buy 
the Tiquisate land at $100 an acre (the upset price), get the equipment and plant for nothing, and buy it as a divestiture under 
the consent decree which would also require UF to sell him the appurtenances needed for a going business including a 
steamship fleet worth $5 million."" Appellant argues that under section VIII(A) or (B) of the consent decree production assets 
were required to be sold, and that since Chalk in his letter of December 30, 1963 to Fox referred to that section, he could not 
have intended to get the assets for nothing. While Chalk may have been familiar with the decree, the letter referred to talks 
about the ""purchase"" by Chalk of acreage; it goes on to say, ""it will be necessary for you to turn over to us simultaneously all the 
facilities . . . ."" (emphasis added). This is susceptible of the interpretation stated by the lower court. The memorandum of the 
conference of September 30, 1963 between UF and Chalk is enlightening. Mr. Blow commented, ""Mr. Chalk then turned to 
Paragraphs B and C of Article VIII of the consent judgment. He said of Paragraph B that this paragraph necessarily called for 'a 
real money negotiation' and that his interest was in buying 'cheap.'"" In view of Chalk's failure to come up with a total price or a 
means of independent financing, we agree with the court below that it is doubtful in any case that the Department of Justice 
would have permitted a divestiture to Chalk."

Neither requisite was established here. We also note that equipment preferences or discrimination are not to be found in the usual litany of per se violations under the

para. 75,072 (9th Cir.  May 9, 1974), was withdrawn by the full court's Order of December 19, 1974.  The original majority

762,2," Certain testimony indicated that Sylvania instituted its elbow room policy in order to avoid being driven out of the television 
market. Ray J.  Steiner, at the time of trial the Vice President of Sony Corporation of America, and prior to April, 1969, the 
National Sales Manager of Sylvania, testified as follows: "". . . basically elbow room was as a result of the fact that as a company we were in trouble. By that I mean that we needed 
something, a sales pitch that the sales company could use in order for us to get a foot hold in the market. Basically we were competing with RCA, Zenith, Magnavox, Motorola, private brands, and very frankly we were not doing a 
good job. So the elbow room is basically a selective or limited distribution approach that has been used by other companies in the 
business, for example, Magnavox, Frigidaire, and we decided that we could no longer have a me too approach to the 
dealers. Because if we were in a me too approach or the same type of approach as RCA or Zenith, basically there was no reason 
for the dealers to handle our line because they could handle other lines."
762,*," * * * We knew that if the advent of this program, if it didn't work and we didn't keep our plant running in Batavia, there was the 
alternative that we would probably go out of the television business."" (Record at 2543-44) (Emphasis added)."
762,*," * * * . . . the result was that it [the elbow room policy] was successful.  We did get a foothold in the market place and we were 
able to compete with the big boys in the business and it got the onus off our back that we were going out of business."" 
(Record at 2554) (Emphasis added). William E. Boss, Jr., the Vice President of Marketing for Sylvania, testified that the purpose of the elbow room policy was: "". . . really to enable us and our retailers to survive profitably, to effectively compete in a marketplace. Limited distribution 
merely means that there are less dealers in a given area. We have, for example, perhaps one-sixth of the dealers of our 
competition, but by having a limited distribution policy we feel that we can develop a more mutually profitable business with 
the retailer. If we were to go out and compete with the majors we would not be successful."" (Emphasis added). "
763,3," Selective distribution was pioneered in the late 1950's by another company, Magnavox, which held only a small share of the 
television market.  By utilizing this method of distribution, as above noted, Sylvania was able to increase its share of the market 
to approximately five percent, thereby becoming an effective interbrand competitor."
763,4," At trial Sylvania denied that its elbow room policy involved any express or implied agreement with its franchised dealers 
concerning the movement of television sets. Sylvania insisted that its elbow room policy was implemented unilaterally by an 
announcement. However, for purposes of this appeal Sylvania has deferred to the implied findings of the jury and has argued its 
appeal upon the assumption that an implied agreement existed between Sylvania and its dealers prohibiting the shipment of 
inventory to unauthorized locations. "
764,5," In 1965, Continental opened five new stores. Its sales volume exceeded $1,000,000, and it had a $300,000 line of credit with 
Sylvania. "
765,6," The jury's verdict was returned in the form of answers to special interrogatories. The verdict in respect to the antitrust claim is 
as follows: A. Antitrust Claim"
765,1," . Did Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. engage in a contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of 
the antitrust laws with respect to location restrictions and price fixing as an integral part of a single distribution policy? /Yes X /No"
765,2," . Did Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. engage in a contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of 
the antitrust laws with respect to locations restrictions alone? X /Yes     /No"
765,3," . Did John P. Maguire & Co., Inc. engage with Sylvania in a contract, combination or conspiracy: a. As described in Question 1 above? /Yes X /No b. As described in Question 2 above? /Yes X /No"
765,4," . If the answer to Question 1, 2, or 3 is ""yes"", did Continental T. V., Inc., sustain damage to its business or property as a 
proximate result of such violation of the antitrust laws? X /Yes     /No"
765,5," . If the answer to Question 4 is ""yes"", what is the amount of such damage? $591,505"
765,7," The trial judge's finding on this point appears to be in conflict with the finding of the jury that Maguire and Sylvania were not 
involved in any contract, combination, or conspiracy to enforce the location restriction.  HN1[
] When issues common to both "
766,," legal and equitable claims are to be tried together, the legal issues are to be tried first, and the findings of the jury are binding on 
the trier of the equitable claims.  Beacon Theatres v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 3 L. Ed. 2d 988, 79 S. Ct. 948 (1959). We 
therefore rely upon the findings of the jury if they appear to be inconsistent with findings of the trial judge."
766,8," HN2[
] Since the incidental injunctive relief granted below was predicated upon the application of an erroneous legal standard 
(See the District Court's conclusion of law No. 5, quoted infra note 9), the equitable Decree, in addition to the legal Judgment, 
must be vacated. See United States v. Parke Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960); Beverage 
Distributors, Inc. v. Olympia Brewing Co., 440 F.2d 21 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 906, 29 L. Ed. 2d 682, 91 S. Ct. 2209 
(1971)."
766,9," The district judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to the equitable Decree. The most significant 
conclusions are as follows: ""3. Sylvania, during the time involved herein, and in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, did engage in a contract, 
combination or conspiracy with its retail dealers, including Handy Andy and Continental, pursuant to which it restricted and 
enforced its location distribution policy and imposed a system of location restraints upon its retail dealers limiting for all 
practical purposes the areas in which they could display and sell Sylvania brand products which the dealers had purchased 
from Sylvania and which were owned by them."
766,4," . As a proximate result of Sylvania's conduct as above described, Continental sustained damage to its business and 
property as found by the jury. Moreover, equitable relief having been granted in the Judgment heretofore entered on the 
11th day of December, 1970, the Court deems it necessary to enter in support thereof, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of 
Law contained herein."
766,5," . The foregoing restraints are per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, inasmuch as Sylvania made sales to its 
retailers upon 'condition, agreement or understanding limiting the retailers freedom as to where and to whom it will resell 
the products', these sales having been made 'subject to territorial restrictions upon resale.' United States v. Arnold[,] 
Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365 at 378-379, [18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856] (1967)."""
766,10," The trial judge in this case was the distinguished Associate Justice Tom C. Clark (Ret.), sitting by designation in the District 
Court. In formulating his jury instructions, Justice Clark apparently adopted some of his own dissenting comments in White Motor 
Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 275, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963). There, the majority of the Court, against the will 
of Mr. Justice Clark, declined to establish a broad per se rule regarding all vertical territorial restraints."
766,11," The court also rejected a jury instruction proposed by Sylvania which propounded the theory that even if the Schwinn per se 
rule were applicable to locations restrictions, Sylvania would be exonerated if it could prove a ""failing company"" defense. The 
rejected instruction reads as follows: "
767,," ""If you find such a contract, combination or conspiracy to restrain movement or sale of merchandise, such a practice would 
be presumptively unlawful. However, before you can find it to be a violation of the antitrust laws, you must consider whether 
it was justified. In this case, such a restriction would be justified if Sylvania had proved by a preponderance of the evidence 
that the adoption of such a restriction was reasonably necessary to enable Sylvania to remain in the television business or 
to enable it to increase the strength and effectiveness of its competitive efforts in the television industry. If you find that such 
justification has been shown, you should find that Sylvania and Maguire have not violated the antitrust laws. If you find that 
Sylvania has not proved such a justification by a preponderance of the evidence, and if you find the existence of a contract, 
combination or conspiracy to restrict movement or sale of merchandise, as I have defined it above, then you should find 
that Sylvania has violated the antitrust laws."" (Emphasis added)."
767,12," We think it noteworthy that all of the law review commentators who have undertaken a detailed analysis of the decision of our 
court's original panel have reached the conclusion that the District Court's application of a per se rule of illegality was wholly 
inappropriate and that, in light of the purposes of the Sherman Act, the ""rule of reason"" should have been applied. Robinson,

770,16," White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963), involved customer restrictions that 
precluded distributors and dealers from selling trucks to any federal or state government or subdivision thereof and to other large 
customers without the permission of the manufacturer."
770,17," One exceptionally distinguished commentator, very recently the Assistant Attorney General heading the Antitrust Division of 
the Department of Justice and now a United States District Judge, has interpreted Schwinn as clearly exempting locations 
clauses from the rule of per se illegality because a locations clause is implicit in this right of a manufacturer to select his dealers: "
771,," ""Justice Fortas' opinion does clearly exempt two types of arrangements.  First, it upholds the right of a manufacturer to 
select - or 'franchise' - the dealers 'to whom, alone, he will sell his goods' - citing United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 
300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919) - where competitive products are readily available. A necessary element of the 
right to 'franchise' - which I suggest is really a word of art covering the Category 2 arrangement described earlier - is the 
right to have a 'location clause.' That is, a manufacturer must be free to appoint another to be his dealer at a given place 
and to agree not to appoint another dealer within a certain distance. If this were not so, a manufacturer would exhaust his 
right of dealer selection - which Justice Fortas says he has - once he appointed a single dealer. Moreover, the auto dealer 
location clause - allowed to stand in the General Motors Discount House case - would be outlawed sub silentio."" McLaren, Territorial and Customer Restrictions, Consignments, Suggested Retail Prices and Refusals to Deal, 37 Antitrust L.J. 
137, 144-45 (1968) (footnote omitted)."
771,18," The conclusion we reach is not inconsistent with the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 
in Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 506 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1975). Two fundamental distinctions between Coors and the 
present case make the reasoning of Coors inapplicable to our situation: (1) Coors involved overt price fixing, a clear per se 
violation of section one of the Sherman Act. As Judge Gee pointed out in his concurring opinion (506 F.2d at 955), any 
consideration of Schwinn was unnecessary to the decision in Coors.  (2) The restrictions involved in Coors were, like those in 
Schwinn, designed to foreclose all intrabrand competition, while Sylvania's ""elbow room policy"" undeniably retained and fostered 
substantial intrabrand competition. In Coors, the plaintiff alleged that Coors combined or conspired with its distributors to fix the retail price of its beer and caused its 
distributors, servicing the plaintiff's retail liquor store, to discontinue the supply of Coors beer to the plaintiff when he sold below 
the suggested retail price and declined to give assurances that he would not continue to do so in the future.  506 F.2d at 936. 
HN12[
] Vertical price fixing, of course, has long been recognized as a per se violation of the Sherman Act. United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 88 L. Ed. 1024, 64 S. Ct. 805 (1944). There being evidence that Coors had 
conspired to fix prices, we agree with Judge Gee that it was unnecessary for the court to rely upon Schwinn so as to hold that 
Coors' practices were a per se antitrust violation. But of more significance is the fact that the Coors opinion explicitly recites that 
the evidence of price fixing was the foundation for the determination that Coors' restrictions ran afoul of the Schwinn holding: ""We do not say that vertically imposed territorial restrictions may never comport with the Sherman Act; Schwinn itself 
conceded they might be proper in the case of new entrants in a highly competitive field or 'failing companies'. And there 
may be other exceptions. We say only that this record does not, as a matter of law, provide justification for excepting Coors 
from the effect of Schwinn, in light of the price fixing evidence."" 506 F.2d at 945 (Emphasis in original). Later in the Coors opinion the court abandoned an inquiry into various exceptions which the Tenth Circuit has engrafted onto the 
Schwinn rule, saying: ""But we need pursue the question no further here. Coors's restraints were ancillary to an illegal price fixing scheme."" 506 
F.2d at 947-48. We therefore believe that there is no significant similarity between our situation and that presented in Coors. In Coors territorial 
restraints were utilized to effect vertical price fixing - a clear per se violation by whatever means it is achieved. Here, there was 
absolutely no evidence that Sylvania engaged in price fixing or that there was any other unlawful purpose underlying the location 
clause agreements. The second major distinction between Coors and the present case inheres in the competitive effects of the challenged territorial 
agreements. In addition to his claim of price fixing, the plaintiff in Coors contended that ""Coors conspired or combined with its 
distributors to create and enforce exclusive territories within which each distributor was to conduct his business, making it 
impossible for the plaintiff to obtain a supply of Coors beer from another distributor once his original supply had been cut off."" 
506 F.2d at 936 (Emphasis added). Mr. Coors himself stated that ""unless the distributor could be assured that he would not be 
confronted with competition from another Coors distributor within his territory - assured there would be no intrabrand competition "
772,," - the distributor would be unwilling to make the necessary capital expenditure, and lending institutions would be unwilling to 
extend credit to him."" 506 F.2d at 938 (Emphasis added). In contrast to the Coors restrictions which ""assured that there would be no intrabrand competition"" because the distributor 
promised to ""conduct his wholesale distribution exclusively within the prescribed territory"" (506 F.2d at 938), Sylvania permitted 
intrabrand competition. No Sylvania retailer was forbidden to sell to persons residing outside any prescribed territory, and 
Sylvania franchised more than one dealer in every major metropolitan area in Northern California. It was not impossible for a 
buyer to purchase from more than one seller, as it was for the plaintiff in Coors. Thus, the restriction in Coors, like the restriction 
in Schwinn and unlike Sylvania's location clauses, ""assured that there would be no intrabrand competition."" Similar considerations apply to the Tenth Circuit's decision in Adolph Coors Company v. FTC, 497 F.2d 1178 (10th Cir. 1974), 
cert.  denied, 419 U.S. 1105, 42 L. Ed. 2d 801, 95 S. Ct. 775 (1975). We need not speculate as to how that decision might relate 
to locations clauses, since the Tenth Circuit expressly considered the legality of locations clauses in the later case of Salco 
Corp. v. General Motors Corp., (discussed at p. 994, infra) and resolved the issue as we resolve it now."
772,19," See Robinson, Recent Antitrust Developments - 1974, 75 Colum. L.  Rev. 243, 276 n.207 (1975)."
772,20," ""We need not reach these questions concerning the meaning, effect, or validity of the 'location clause' or of any other provision 
in the Dealer Selling Agreement, and we do not. We do not decide whether the 'location clause' may be construed to prohibit a 
dealer, party to it, from selling through discounters, or whether General Motors could by unilateral action enforce the clause, so 
construed."" United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 139-40, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 1321 (1966)."
772,21," Another case, United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972), dealt similarly 
with locations clauses. Although Topco involved horizontal rather than vertical limitations, the District Court, on remand, 
expressly allowed the defendant to fix the locations of his licensees, except where doing so would give an exclusive territory to 
another licensee. The District Court's Judgment provided: "". . . nothing in this Final Judgment shall prevent defendant . . .  (2) from designating the location of the place or places of 
business for which a trademark license is issued, provided that the defendant shall not refuse to grant a trademark license 
to any member or withdraw a license from any member, except any withdrawal incidental to the bona fide termination of 
any member firm's membership in Topco, if such action would achieve or maintain territorial exclusivity in any member 
firm."" United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 1973 Trade Cas. (CCH) para. 74,391 (N.D. Ill. 1973). An appeal was taken from the judgment entered by the District Court, after remand, and this judgment was summarily affirmed, 
with only Mr.  Justice Douglas dissenting.  414 U.S. 801, 94 S. Ct. 116, 38 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1973). "
773,," The dissenting opinions written by my brothers Browning and Kilkenny rely heavily upon language from the Supreme Court's 
opinion in Topco for the sweeping and unqualified conclusion that, in Judge Kilkenny's words, ""restricted intrabrand competition 
cannot be justified by alleged interbrand competitive gain."" The majority believes that such a broad interpretation of Topco is 
plainly wrong. In Topco the Court held that the District Court had erred by applying a rule of reason to a horizontal restraint, 
which, the Court noted, is ""one of the classic examples of a per se violation of § 1."" 405 U.S. at 608. Thus, Topco stands only for the accepted proposition that HN13[
] a rule of reason may not be applied in circumstances 
wherein a per se violation has been clearly established. A vertical device, like the locations clause employed in the present case, 
is by no means a ""classic example"" of a per se violation. When, as here, the issue of per se liability has not been previously 
determined, Topco in no way precludes consideration of whatever gains in interbrand competition have resulted from intrabrand 
restrictions."
773,22," Continental attempts to circumvent the precedent established by the Schwinn, Topco, and General Motors ( United States v. 
General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 1321 (1966)) orders on remand by arguing that the 
manufacturer's acknowledged right to ""franchise by location"" means only that a franchisor may authorize a dealer to hold himself 
out as the ""authorized agent"" of the franchisor only at certain locations. Thus, the argument continues, the right to ""franchise by 
location"" does not give the franchisor any right to prevent the franchisee from opening as many additional outlets as he wishes at 
unauthorized locations, and the franchisor must provide additional quantities of product and related services to the dealer at 
these locations. HN14[
] The ""right to franchise by location"" is construed to mean only that the franchisor may deny his 
franchisee the right to ""hold himself out as the authorized agent"" of the manufacturer at these additional locations. We find the foregoing argument to be highly artificial and even spurious.  The very fact that the television sets sold from the 
unauthorized location bear the Sylvania brand name implies to the public that the store is an ""authorized Sylvania dealer"", even 
if the store cannot expressly identify itself as such. The franchised Sylvania dealer has the advantage of company arranged 
credit, guaranteed company shipments, Sylvania's national advertising of the product, and his recognized name as a Sylvania 
dealer at his authorized locations. Any inherent advantages of being a Sylvania franchisee go with the dealer to the new 
location, regardless of whether he holds himself out at the new location as a franchised Sylvania dealer or not. The decree on 
remand in Schwinn expressly provided that nothing therein should prevent Schwinn ""from designating in its franchise 
agreements the location of the place or places of business for which the franchise is issued"" 291 F. Supp. 564, 566 (N.D. Ill. 
1968). Continental would define ""franchise"", as applied to the facts here, to mean the right of a store at an unauthorized location 
to refer to itself in its advertisements or signs on the premises as an ""authorized Sylvania dealer."" It is obvious to us that the 
word, ""franchise"", should more logically be interpreted to mean the right to purchase television sets from Sylvania for resale, in 
conjunction with the above mentioned benefits; in essence, the right to act as a Sylvania dealer. Both the Schwinn and Sylvania 
franchises were agreements which authorized the dealer to sell the manufacturer's products from a specific location. The 
primary purpose of the franchises in both cases was to authorize the sale and display of the manufacturer's product, as part of 
an overall system of distribution. Therefore, we read the above quoted language from the Schwinn decree on remand explicitly to authorize the practice followed 
by Sylvania, designating the location or locations from which a particular retailer was authorized to operate as the manufacturer's 
dealer. The term ""franchise"" in the Schwinn order on remand has been similarly interpreted by law review commentators. See, 
e.g., Pollack, Alternative Distribution Methods After Schwinn, 63 Nw. U. L. Rev. 595, 603-04 (1968): ""Nor does the Schwinn doctrine outlaw the use of the so-called 'location clause', which designates the location of the place 
of business for which a franchise is issued and which requires the franchisor's consent to operate the business at another 
location. . . . Indeed, without some such agreement, it is difficult to see how a franchise relationship could operate. . . . 
Subsequently in his final decree in the Schwinn case on remand from the Supreme Court, Judge Perry specifically 
authorized Schwinn's use of location clauses in its franchise agreements."""
773,23," The location clause involved in Salco provided: ""Once dealer is established in facilities and at a location . . .  mutually satisfactory to Dealer and Buick, Dealer will not move

774,24," The tendency of the courts to construe the Schwinn holding narrowly has been the subject of law review discussions. See 
Note, Territorial and Customer Restrictions: A Trend Toward a Broader Rule of Reason?, 40 Geo.  Wash. L. Rev. 123 (1971);

774,25," While a locations clause is a common tool utilized by manufacturers in their distributorship or franchise arrangements, it is by 
no means the only vertical restraint that has been employed to subject a distributor or retailer of products bearing a recognized 
trade name to certain controls over his business operations. These other controls on dealer territorial expansion include such 
practices as exclusive dealerships, area of primary responsibility covenants, and profit pass-over requirements. Each of these 
vertical restraints might limit intrabrand competition, and all are susceptible, linguistically, to inclusion within the literal language 
of Schwinn; nevertheless, all have been upheld against claims that they fall within Schwinn's per se rule of prohibition. See 
Colorado Pump & Supply Co. v. Febco Inc., 472 F.2d 637 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 987, 36 L. Ed. 2d 965, 93 S. Ct.

of primary responsibility ""without more"", but holding that there was ""more"" in Monsanto's additional policies that effectively 
curtailed the ability of its distributors to sell Monsanto Herbicides, after purchase, to whomever they wished). HN16[
] A primary responsibility clause is basically an agreement obligating a distributor to concentrate his sole efforts in a 
specified geographical area for which he is primarily responsible. The use of these clauses was endorsed in White Motor Co. v. 
United States, 372 U.S. 253, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963), by Mr. Justice Brennan, who noted in his concurring opinion "
775,," that the lawfulness of area of primary responsibility covenants has been recognized in many consent decrees. (372 U.S. at 271 
n.12). HN17[
] A profit pass-over arrangement requires a dealer who makes sales within the territory of another dealer to turn over 
part of his profits from those sales to that other dealer, to compensate the other dealer for the latter's promotional efforts in the 
territory wherein the sale occurred. Mr. Justice Brennan also discussed this type of restriction in White Motor Co., supra, noting 
""if, for example, such a cross-sale incurs only an obligation to share (or 'pass over') the profit with the dealer whose territory has 
been invaded - as is most often, and apparently here, the case - then the practical effect upon competition of a territorial 
limitation may be no more harmful than that of the typical exclusive franchise - the lawfulness of which the Government does not 
dispute here."" 372 U.S. 253, 270-71, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (Brennan, J., concurring)."
775,26," The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, held in Tripoli that a cosmetic manufacturer's restriction on its distributor's resale of products, 
intended for professional use, to non-professionals was not a per se violation of the Sherman Act, although the challenged 
practice fell within the Schwinn language pertaining to restrictions on resale after title to the product passes to the distributor. 
The court applied the rule of reason and held the restrictions reasonable as a means of protecting the public from potential harm. 
The court chose to restrict Schwinn to its facts, stating: ""That case [Schwinn] does not, as plaintiff proposes, establish as a per se violation every attempt by a manufacturer to 
restrict the persons to whom a wholesaler may resell any product whatsoever, title to which has left the manufacturer. 
Rather, Schwinn must be read, as must all antitrust cases, in its factual context."" 425 F.2d at 936 (3rd Cir. 1970). More recently, the Third Circuit has suggested that the principle established in Tripoli may not be limited to health and safety 
justifications, but may extend to encompass the broader proposition that "". . . where a manufacturer's restriction is related to a 
legitimate business purpose, Schwinn may be inapplicable."" Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco Corp., 494 F.2d 840, 847 n.13 (3rd

777,30," It has been argued that if, under Schwinn, Sylvania could not legally prevent Continental from selling to another unfranchised 
retailer, who thereupon resells from an unauthorized location, then there is no reason why Continental could not sell to itself (by 
shipping television sets to unauthorized locations for resale there). It may be true that any attempt by Sylvania to restrict sales by 
its franchisees to unfranchised dealers would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. However, Sylvania was careful to avoid 
this problem by allowing its dealers to sell to anyone. Allowing a franchised dealer to sell to a non-franchised retailer has a far 
different effect upon the franchisor than allowing a franchisee, in violation of a contract, to open a store at any location he 
chooses. The unfranchised retailer would ordinarily, in the first instance, pay a higher price for the Sylvania product because the 
unfranchised dealer would be buying through a middleman, the franchised dealer, rather than directly from Sylvania. On the 
other hand, as we have previously emphasized, the franchised dealer has the benefit of company arranged credit, guaranteed 
company shipments, and a recognized name as a Sylvania franchisee, as well as the advantage of buying directly from the 
manufacturer at a lower price. And all advantages of the status of a Sylvania franchisee attend the dealer's move to the new 
location, regardless of whether he holds himself out at the new location as a franchised Sylvania dealer. The franchised dealer 
who violates the company's elbow room policy still will retain all the benefits of his franchise, while eliminating the benefits to the 
company of having a reliable market, and spaced distribution. The ultimate economic result of the approach below would likely 
spell the doom of all Sylvania franchised dealers. No longer could Sylvania offer to its dealers the primary advantage of a 
promise not to franchise more dealers than a particular market could reasonably support. This promise on Sylvania's part was 
not nearly as restrictive as an exclusive dealership, which our court and many others have upheld, but it did tend to prevent the 
kind of ""cut-throat"" competition between franchisees that could ultimately result in the destruction of Sylvania as an interbrand 
competitor. The elbow room policy was never used by Sylvania severely to restrict intrabrand competition or to divide markets. 
No dealer had a veto power over the entry of other dealers into his area, and locations were authorized by Sylvania solely on the 
basis of market expandability. Taking another approach, Continental also argues that ""Continental sold in Sacramento not 'to itself', but to an 'unfranchised 
dealer', namely, to S.A.M. Industries, Inc."" In fact, the record thoroughly belies this contention and conclusively demonstrates 
that Continental was indeed shipping to itself in Sacramento because S.A.M. Industries, Inc., was not a separate, independent 
dealer. In the original Answer and Counterclaim, Continental (including S.A.M.) alleges that it, as a group of affiliates, did business in 
California under the firm name and style of ""Continental T.V."" Throughout its Answer S.A.M.  and the other affiliated corporations 
referred to themselves, collectively, as ""Continental."" In his statements to the jury, Continental's attorney made it clear that 
S.A.M. was a part of Continental and that the Sacramento store operated by S.A.M. was doomed to be a link in the Continental 
chain.  The testimony of George Shahood, the President and General Manager of Continental T.V., also shows that the 
Sacramento store was part of Continental T.V.'s whole enterprise. Finally, and as the irrefutable answer to Continental's 
alternate approach, the district judge found as a fact that ""Cross claimants are a group of affiliated corporations in substantially 
common ownership which did business under the name 'Continental T.V.' George Shahood and his wife were the principal 
owners of all the corporations and Mr. Shahood was the principal operating officer."" "

780,36," Lee Egan Preston, Jr., a professor at the School of Management at the State University of New York in Buffalo, testified as to 
his conclusions after a study of the television market: ""A: Now, since Sylvania occupies a relatively small position in the television market and it is therefore a competitive element 
in that market, I think the television market would be less competitive if Sylvania would be out of it, because the number of 
brands, after all, are 10 to 12. Sylvania is in there. They are at the bottom, but in there. Now, if we squeeze out the bottom firms from that market, then I think we would see a decline in competition among brands 
in all the major markets in the country. Therefore, if this distribution policy or any particular distribution policy has the effect 
of strengthening Sylvania or any other smaller firm as a competitive force among the other firms in that market, many of 
which are much larger, then I think we have to look carefully at that policy as an element in competition, indeed as a 
procompetitive policy among the brands and the manufacturers as a whole. Q: In the opinion which you have just described for us, sir, did you ascertain whether the type of distribution policy that you 
have assumed to be employed was in any way beneficial to competition in the sense beyond the one you have just given? A: I think I just responded to that by saying that I think that anything that maintains a range of competition alternatives 
throughout the market strengthens competitive forces there."""
780,*," * * * ""Q: Assuming a distribution practice of the type that you are asked to assume, is there any anticompetitive characteristics

781,36," a See Note, 53 Texas L. Rev. 127, 136 (1974)."
781,37," A number of justifications have been offered for vertically-imposed territorial restraints, a few of which can be briefly 
summarized. We express no view as to the validity of these justifications, either as a matter of abstract economic theory or in the 
context of the specific facts of this case. As previously indicated, under the rule of reason the ultimate question must be 
answered by the trier of fact. Perhaps the major justification offered for such restrictions is that they enable a manufacturer to obtain access to markets that 
are otherwise closed to him. It is altogether probable that distributors will be unwilling to handle a manufacturer's product unless 
they are afforded some protection against ruinous intrabrand competition. Dealers could justifiably believe that in the absence of 
vertical restrictions, ""cutthroat"" intrabrand competition from other dealers would drive down prices and render their operation 
unprofitable, and endanger their capital investment. A second argument in favor of vertical restrictions is the so-called ""free ride"" theory. Vertical restrictions are said to be necessary 
to prevent dealers from invading the territories of other dealers by choosing to rely on the promotional efforts of those other 
dealers rather than undertaking costly selling activities themselves. It is argued, with significant logic, that in the absence of 
vertical territorial restrictions, dealers will not provide advertising or repair facilities as extensively as they would if they could be 
assured that invading dealers will not pirate the benefits of these promotional activities. A third asserted justification for vertical restrictions is that they encourage total sales effort on a dealer's part by facilitating more 
concentrated and intense coverage of each geographic market, thus leading to increased sales of the manufacturer's products. 
Sales to large customers located close to the dealer usually require lower distribution costs than sales to smaller, more distant 
customers. Accordingly, the manufacturer benefits if all customers are charged an identical price and the dealer's savings from 
sales to the choice customers offset the higher costs incurred in sales to others. Vertical territorial restrictions are thus often 
designed to motivate dealers to increase their depth of coverage in narrowly defined areas rather than ""skimming"" choice 
customers over a wider area. A fourth major justification for the legality of vertical restraints is that they are necessary incentives to motivate dealers to provide 
a high quality and character of dealer services such as consumer credit, prompt and efficient repairs, and other post-sale 
services. The theory is that dealers can be persuaded, and are willing, to provide these better services in exchange for some 
insulation from ruinous intrabrand competition. For a more detailed discussion of these justifications and others, see Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price 
Fixing and Market Division, 75 Yale L.J. 373, 430-453 (1966); Comanor, Vertical Territorial and Customer Restrictions: White

781,38," In the words of the present Solicitor General of the United States, "". . . the inescapable fact is that an agreement which 
eliminates competition is basic to almost every productive unit consisting of more than a single person. The agreement may be 
spelled out or, more often, may be tacit, but, to the degree that coordination of the productive activities of persons is achieved, 
actual or potential competition must be eliminated."" Bork, supra n.37 at 377 (1966). For a classic discussion cautioning against 
an overly literal construction of the Sherman Act, see the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Northern Securities Co.  v. 
United States, 193 U.S. 197, 400-411, 24 S. Ct. 436, 48 L. Ed. 679 (1904). "
782,39," A study of HN28[

the Sherman Act was that courts should be guided exclusively by consumer welfare and the economic criteria which that value 
premise implies."" Bork, Legislative Intent and the Policy of the Sherman Act, 9 J. Law & Econ. 7, 11 (1966). The current Solicitor 
General also noted that: ""It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the most faithful judicial reflection of Senator Sherman's and his colleague's policy 
intentions was the rule of reason enunciated by Chief Justice White in the 1911 Standard Oil and American Tobacco 
opinions. There was in White's opinions as in Sherman's speeches the idea that the statute was concerned exclusively with 
consumer welfare and that this meant the law must discourage restriction of output without hampering efficiency. White 
appears also to have incorporated into his rule of reason those major rules of law which Sherman envisaged as implied by 
a consumer-welfare policy.  The rules implied by the policy are alterable as economic analysis progresses, however. White 
clearly foresaw this and incorporated that principle of change into the rule of reason."" Id. at 47."
782,40," We acknowledge that, as a matter of economic theory, there is a sharp divergence of opinion as to the alleged procompetitive 
effects of vertical territorial restrictions. Perhaps the classic exposition of the competing arguments appear in two discussions, 
one written by Solicitor General Bork, and the other by William Comanor. Compare Bork, supra n.37, with Comanor, supra n.37. 
We do not further summarize the major aspects of the competing views, inasmuch as our reasoning in the present case 
endorses neither of the views. We simply believe that the fact that a disagreement exists, and the corresponding possibility that 
the locations clauses involved here may have had a procompetitive effect, renders wholly inappropriate the application of a per 
se rule of illegality. The ultimate consideration of the procompetitive merits of Sylvania's practice must be conducted under the 
rule of reason."
782,41," Sylvania vigorously contends that even if its locations practice could be held to be illegal per se under Schwinn, then it should 
have had the benefit of an instruction on the ""failing company"" defense. We have hitherto quoted its proffered jury instruction in 
this respect. See note 11 supra. Sylvania argues that at the time its ""elbow room"" policy was instituted, Sylvania would have 
been compelled to abandon its television manufacturing business if it did not increase its share of the market in the manner that 
it did. HN29[
] The failing company defense has generally been applied to mergers or acquisitions which would otherwise 
violate the antitrust laws. United States v. Greater Buffalo Press, 402 U.S. 549, 29 L. Ed. 2d 170, 91 S. Ct. 1692 (1971); Citizen 
Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148, 89 S. Ct. 927 (1969); International Shoe Co. v. FTC, 280 U.S.

L.J. 597 (1964); Connor, Section 7 of the Clayton Act: The Failing Company Myth, 49 Geo. L.J. 84 (1960). However, United 
States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967) indicates that the defense is also 
available in cases wherein a vertical restraint is being challenged. The Court in Schwinn clearly indicated its intent that the failing 
company defense, once shown, would then subject the case to the rule of reason and the per se rule would not be applicable. 
We requote the Court's remarks: "
783,," ""We first observe that the facts of this case do not come within the specific illustrations which the Court in White Motor 
articulated as possible factors relevant to a showing that the challenged vertical restraint is sheltered by the rule of reason 
because it is not anticompetitive. Schwinn was not a newcomer, seeking to break into or stay in the bicycle business. It was 
not a 'failing company '."""
783,388," U.S. at 374. However, because we have determined that the trial court erred in applying the Schwinn rule of per se illegality 
to Sylvania's locations clauses and that a new trial is therefore required, we find it unnecessary now to decide whether there was 
sufficient evidence to warrant instructing the jury on the failing company defense. For future guidance to the District Court, 
however, we think it presently appropriate to emphasize that HN30[
] even if a manufacturer is prosperous in its whole 
operation, the failing company defense is applicable if the company is failing in the manufacture and distribution of one of its 
significant products. In Schwinn, Mr. Justice Fortas wrote of the ""product market."" 388 U.S. at 382. Similarly, our determination that the rule of per se illegality established in Schwinn is inapplicable to the Sylvania location 
practice challenged here also makes it unnecessary for us to consider the merits of Sylvania's argument that it had no 
reasonable basis for believing its practices violated the antitrust laws because the conduct in question occurred before the 
Schwinn decision."
783,42," While the disposition of the present case was under consideration by the full court, a panel issued its opinion in Noble v. 
McClatchy Newspapers, 533 F.2d 1081 (9th Cir. 1975). The majority here has no quarrel with the result reached by the Noble court; however, any language in the Noble opinion that 
may be inconsistent with any of the majority's language in the present case is hereby disapproved."
783,1," In passing on whether or not to grant an injunction on the appellant's practices, the district court entered elaborate findings of 
fact which are in direct contradiction of many of the statements in the majority opinion.  For example, footnote 30 of the majority 
opinion states that ""the elbow room policy was never used by Sylvania severely to restrict intrabrand competition or to divide 
markets. No dealer had a veto power over the entry of other dealers into his area, and locations were authorized by Sylvania 
solely on the basis of market expandability."" However, in its 16th finding of fact the district court concluded that ""the action of 
Sylvania [reducing Continental's credit line, cancelling Continental's orders, and cutting off all communication with Continental, 
among other things] was taken pursuant to the contract, combination or conspiracy alleged by Continental and was part and 
parcel thereof and at the instance of Sylvania's co-conspirator Handy Andy; and as a result thereof Continental was prevented 
from selling its Sylvania brand products in its store in Sacramento."" The district court also found that on September 7, 1965, 
Sylvania's area sales manager advised Continental's principal operating officer ""that due to prior 'commitments' which Sylvania 
had with Handy Andy, it was impossible for Sylvania to franchise Continental in Sacramento."" Needless to say, the findings of 
the district court are implicit in and grow out of the jury's general verdict and its affirmative response to the previously maintained 
special interrogatory. "
785,1," a The pertinent instructions read: ""So too, concerted action in the form of dividing territories in which a dealer may resell merchandise purchased from the 
manufacturer without resale price maintenance constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws. That is to say, where a 
manufacturer, by means of a contract, combination or conspiracy, restricts the territories within which a dealer may resell 
merchandise purchased from the manufacturer, such a restriction is unlawful regardless of whether or not that restriction is 
good business practice from the manufacturer's point of view and is likely to assure adequate volume of profits. Any 
agreement, combination or conspiracy by which a manufacturer interferes with the ordinary and usual forces of competition 
to restrict the territories within which dealers may resell merchandise which they have purchased from the manufacturer or 
to keep one dealer from competing for customers or sales in a territory or area served by another dealer also constitutes a 
violation of the antitrust laws, whether or not the territories resulting seem reasonable or unreasonable. ""Therefore, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Sylvania entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy 
with one or more of its dealers pursuant to which Sylvania exercised dominion or control over the products sold to the 
dealer, after having parted with title and risk to the products, you must find any effort thereafter to restrict outlets or store 
locations from which its dealers resold the merchandise which they had purchased from Sylvania to be a violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, regardless of the reasonableness of the location restrictions. On the other hand, on this question of territorial or customer restrictions, you are instructed that a manufacturer, such as 
Sylvania, has a right, acting alone and independently for its own business interests, to select its customers, and for this 
purpose, the manufacturer may grant an exclusive 'franchise' to certain dealers to whom, alone, he will sell his products. 
Also, it is lawful for the manufacturer to designate the location or locations of the place or places of business for which said 
dealer or dealers are franchised. It is also lawful for the manufacturer to decline or refuse to grant a dealer's request for a 
franchise at different or additional locations."" [Tr. 3446-48]"
785,1," b Continental's counsel said: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, there are also types of antitrust cases, which this is, which are so pernicious, the policies are so 
pernicious to competition, so anti-competitive in their impact on our economy that the law states there is no possible way to 
justify them. And, ladies and gentlemen, the two restrictions involved in this case are such marketing, distribution 
restrictions: Territorial restrictions and price maintenance restrictions are what lawyers and courts call per se violations of 
the act if they are enforced by contract, combination or conspiracy. ""So despite what Mr. Popofsky told you in his opening argument, despite what Prof. Preston testified to on the stand, the 
facts are that it is only necessary in this case to find, number one, that Sylvania had a policy by which it restricted the 
territory in which and/or customers to which Continental could sell Sylvania products after it had purchased them from 
Sylvania. ""As a part of that distribution policy, Sylvania maintained minimum prices and enforced those minimum prices."" [Tr. 3338]"
785,1, c Sylvania's counsel said: 
786,," ""You will not be asked, as counsel pointed out, to make any decision about the reasonableness of the distribution practice 
or whether or not competition is or is not being bettered or furthered. ""You will be asked only to decide what is the true character of the Sylvania practice. Was it the character that Continental 
suggests? Did it really involve price-fixing on the one hand and control over territories on the other, or did it, as we suggest, 
involve no more than a franchise by location practice? ""If it is the latter we contend the instructions make it lawful. So you will be asked only to identify the character of the 
practice."" [Tr. 3378] "
788,2," Compare Professor Schmitt's descriptions of the effects of the location clause employed by automobile manufacturers: The location clause inherently limits the dealer's ability to reach customers outside his marketing segment. The size of this 
segment varies according to the shopping habits of customers, traffic connections and population density. Even though a 
dealer is free to sell to customers wherever they may be located, the location clause secured market segmentation which 
effectively allows the manufacturer to control the degree of intrabrand competition. The location clause factually restricts the 
dealer's business activities directly in terms of territorial freedom and indirectly in terms of freedom of customer choice. Schmitt, Antitrust & Distribution Problems in Tight Oligopolies - A Case Study of the Automobile Industry, 24 Hastings L.J. 849, 
903-04 (1973)."
788,3," The only finding of the district court questioned by the majority is the finding that Sylvania requested Maguire to sue Continental 
on its outstanding notes as a part of Sylvania's attempt to prevent Continental from selling Sylvania products in Sacramento. We 
do not agree that this finding is ""in conflict with the finding of the jury that Maguire and Sylvania were not involved in any 
contract, combination, or conspiracy to enforce the location restriction."" Majority Opinion, footnote 7. The jury's conclusion that 
Maguire was not part of the conspiracy to impose resale restrictions on Continental is consistent with a finding that Sylvania 
used Maguire in carrying out the conspiracy between Sylvania and Handy Andy found explicitly by the trial judge and by 
implication by the jury as well. "
789,4," In Hobart Bros. Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., supra, the manufacturer, Hobart, used an area of primary responsibility clause 
to limit the territory in which Gilliland would sell Hobart's products. Since Hobart not only manufactured but also sold on the same 
level as its dealers, the effect of the restriction was a horizontal division of markets eliminating competition between Hobart and 
its dealers. The court concluded that ""such an arrangement must be treated as it operated in practice rather than 'as arranged by 
skillful drafting.' Cf.  Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98, 84 S. Ct. 1051 (1964)."" Id. 471 F.2d at 899. See

794,9," It is mentioned in the body of our dissent that Salco failed to recognize or even mention the Schwinn prohibition on resale. To 
demonstrate that this restriction is now fully recognized in the later 10th Circuit case of World of Sleep, Inc. v. Stearns & Foster 
Co., 525 F.2d 40 (1975), we quote: ""The Schwinn case played a dominant role in the trial of the instant case, and the trial judge attempted to tailor his 
instructions to fit the teaching of that case. In Schwinn, it was held that where a manufacturer, such as Stearns in the 
instant case, sells his product to a distributor, such as World of Sleep, and in connection with such sale 'firmly and 
resolutely' subjects the distributor to territorial restrictions upon resale, whether by 'explicit agreement or silent combination 
or understanding with his vendee,' a per se violation of the Sherman Act results."" Id. at 44."

retains title, dominion and risk with respect to the product, and the position of the dealer is akin to that of an agent or

impact of such limitation is 'unreasonably' restrictive of competition. . . ."" Id. at 45."
794,10," After reviewing Schwinn and several other relevant authorities, the author states that . . . to dust off the old Boro Hall decision and add that the location clause was not rendered unlawful in United States v.

questionable at best. "
796,1," If the majority's statement that ""the legislative intent underlying the Sherman Act had as its goal the promotion of consumer 
welfare"" (p. 1003) is meant to exclude other purposes, it is refuted by the legislative history referred to in the authorities cited 
herein. Even assuming that some contemporary economists might maintain that in a given case consumer interests might be 
better served by eliminating competition between independent businessmen, ""There is little evidence that Sherman and the 
others had any idea of imposing an economist's model of competition on American industry. They did not consult economists of 
the time; and if they had done so, they would have found little support for any such course."" A. Neale, The Antitrust Laws of the 
United States of America 13 (2d ed. 1970). In striking contrast to the views of the Congress, economists of the late 1800's 
considered ""trusts"" and other combinations to be a natural evoluntionary advance, and monopolies to be both inevitable and 
potentially beneficial. Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890, 23 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221, 237-38 (1956). 
Considering the level of economic thought prevailing in 1890, it is inconceivable that Congress passed the Sherman Act ""out of 
an exclusive preoccupation with the idea that prices should always equal marginal costs."" Blake & Jones, In Defense of Antitrust, 
65 Colum. L. Rev. 377, 384 (1965). "
797,2," ""In the congressional debates, the Sherman Act was urged as a means of dealing with great trusts that had accumulated 
tremendous power threatening small businessmen, the consuming public, and the social order.  Its purpose was variously 
conceived to be to preserve 'free and full competition,' to protect the public against high prices, and to protect small business 
and individual freedom against corporate wealth and power.  In the broad, general terms of the debates, the Senators appeared 
to regard these social, political, and economic purposes as consistent, collateral thrusts of the Act."" Bohling, Franchise 
Terminations Under the Sherman Act: Populism and Relational Power, 53 Texas L. Rev. 1180, 1189 (1975). ""The legislators 
were well aware of the common law on restraints of trade, and of the powers of monopolists to hurt the public by raising price,

799,6," United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 427 (2d Cir. 1945). A perceptive foreign observer suggests that this preference for a system of independent, competing business entities reflects an 
American distrust ""of all sources of unchecked power"": An economy made up of independent, competing business units fulfils the condition that economic decision making should 
be dispersed and renders the holders of economic power liable to mutual encroachment. It is important to this conception 
that the individual's right to engage in business activities of his own choice shall be preserved and that no single economic 
unit, whether in the form of monopoly or combination, shall be able to exclude rivals at its own behest and so render its own 
power immune from invasion. A. Neale, supra note 1, at 430. "
800,7," Under Schwinn ""a juggling of labels or of the place of passage of title will not suffice to invoke rule of reason treatment. Nor will 
the casting into the consignment mold of relationships with independent economic entities in the distribution business, whose 
business decisions on the sale of the products would reflect functions, investments, and goals which in fact differ from those of 
the producer, serve to immunize restrictions. In fact, as well as in form, the consignee's function must be close to that of a mere 
salesman for the producer, for the law to tolerate producer-imposed restrictions on the consignee's decision-making.""

of Agency and Sale in Antitrust: General Electric, Simpson, Schwinn, 53 Minn. L. Rev. 57, 67 (1968). When asked whether a 
supplier could avoid the impact of Schwinn by switching to distribution by consignment, Professor Turner (then Assistant 
Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division) replied: Our position would be that any time we see price fixing and resale price maintenance, territorial restrictions, or customer 
limitations imposed on distributors - though they be called consignees - who are performing significant functions in addition 
to a selling function, and there is no excuse of the kind we have indicated we think reasonable, such as new entrants, we 
will attack those restrictions. Panel Discussion, Orderly Marketing, Franchising and Trademark Licensing: Have They Been Routed by Schwinn and Sealy?

800,8," Professor Averill writes that behind Schwinn is ""the idea that each separate unit of a distribution system which risks its capital

to whom it will sell."" Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and Sherman One: An Analysis and Prognosis, 15 N.Y.L.F. 39, 64 (1969). Other

interbrand competition"")."
801,10," 388 U.S. at 380-81. The Court explicitly looked to the ""product market as a whole,"" intrabrand and interbrand, in applying the 
rule of reason to Schwinn's distribution through consignees under which Schwinn retained ownership and risk.  Id. at 382. For further evidence that the Court was fully aware of the alleged benefits to interbrand competition of Schwinn's distribution 
program, see Keck, The Schwinn Case, 23 Bus. Law. 669 (1968)."
801,11," Topco defended its use of territorial division in terms nearly identical to those employed by Schwinn and Sylvania: Topco essentially maintains that it needs territorial divisions to compete with larger chains; that the association could not 
exist if the territorial divisions were anything but exclusive; and that by restricting competition in the sale of Topco-brand 
goods, the association actually increases competition by enabling its members to compete successfully with larger regional 
and national chains. United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, 405 U.S.  at 605. The Supreme Court's rationale for not considering Topco's 
economic justification for stifling intrabrand competition was applied not only to the horizontal division of territories in which 
members could retail Topco-brand goods, but also to territorial and customer restrictions on wholesaling by members of Topco.  
Id. at 612. The Court reasoned that: like territorial restrictions, limitations on customers are intended to limit intra-brand competition and to promote inter-brand 
competition.  For the reasons previously discussed, the arena in which Topco members compete must be left to their 
unfettered choice absent a contrary congressional determination.  United States v. General Motors Corp., supra; cf. United 
States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. supra . . . . Id. Like the restraints held per se illegal in Topco, Sylvania's vertically imposed territorial restriction on Continental was intended 
to limit intrabrand competition and promote interbrand competition.  Thus, the reasons given by the Court in Topco for not 
examining the ""difficult economic problems"" involved in attempting to balance losses in competition in one sector of the economy 
against alleged gains in another are equally relevant in this case. "
802,12," The Court quoted Mr. Justice Black's explanation of the need for per se rules in such situations in Northern Pac. Ry. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958): ""This principle of per se unreasonableness not only makes the type 
of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, but it also avoids the 
necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as 
well as related industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable - an inquiry so 
often wholly fruitless when undertaken."" 405 U.S. at 607."

differentiation, such restrictions eliminate not only intrabrand competition, but competition between brands as well. Comanor, 
supra, at 1437; Zimmerman, supra note 7, at 1183-85; Schmitt, supra, at 906. The economic justifications offered in support of vertical restraints are carefully examined and rejected by Judge Wisdom in

requests or demands (R.T. 2904); that Sylvania did not use coercive means to prohibit a dealer in one territory from selling in 
another territory (R.T. 2905-07); that no dealer relied to a greater extent than normal on Sylvania for product (R.T. 2907-09); and 
that no excluded dealer was an especially vigorous competitor (R.T. 2929-30)."

ourselves on it, but I don't think we would be able to. . . . . Q. There is really no way you can tell from the competitive effect at a retail level - you can't tell from that type of information what 
the competitive effect at the manufacturing level is going to be, can you? A. They are not the same thing. I agree with that, that they are not the same. Q. And there doesn't seem any direct correlation between the two? A. Of course, if a firm, as I say, was pricing its product way out of competitive limits at the retail level, then it would show a 
decline in marketing shares at the manufacturing level. Q. Didn't you say in this article, starting at page 508 in Duke Law Review: ""A closely related matter is the interaction between horizontal and vertical market relationships. The present state of economic 
analysis doesn't in general permit us to specify the impact of changes of one of several vertically related market levels upon

entire business or service which is promoted nationally under a trademarked name and associated in the public mind with a 
highly distinctive external appearance or with a standardized uniform operation. There is no indication that the Court 
intended these decisions to apply across the board to trademark-licensing arrangements, also frequently subsumed under 
the term franchising, in which the licensor imposes restrictions on the licensees to ensure the identity of origin, quality, and 
uniformity of the trademarked product and thus preserve his rights in the trademark. Nothing in any of the Court's four 
opinions would suggest that even in the case of outright sales of trademarked products the Court intended to modify 
established trademark law which requires the trademark owner to maintain sufficient control over his licensees to assure 
that his mark will not be deemed abandoned and that the licensee will apply the mark either to the same products or to 
products of substantially the same quality that the public in the past has associated with the mark."

109-10. Shortly after the Supreme Court's Schwinn decision, Arnold, Schwinn & Co.  took over the functions of its nine independent 
wholesale distributors. The case, however, is not typical. The company had few independent dealers; 75% of its distribution was 
by consignment which was upheld by the Schwinn decision. In the extensive literature on Schwinn published in the decade since 
that decision, no evidence is offered that forward integration by producers into distribution has been accelerated by the Supreme 
Court's ruling. The automobile and oil industries, which account for two thirds of all franchising sales, are examples of industries 
which have not integrated following antitrust decisions requiring the abandonment of vertical restraints on independent dealers. 
Such integration is unlikely, in the automobile industry, in the future. Schmitt, supra note 13, at 913. In the oil industry, the 
substantial diseconomies that would result from integration (Miller, Exclusive Dealing in the Petroleum Industry: The Refiner-
Lessee Dealer Relationship, 3 Yale Econ. Essays 223, 232 (1963)) are a significant disincentive to distribution through 
company-owned outlets. See Comanor, supra note 13, at 1435-36 & n.32. The following are illustrative of judgments that the net effect of the Schwinn prohibition of vertical territorial restraints will be to 
benefit small independent businesses: Therefore, all this decision is saying, and what it really means is that a person in a dominant position cannot have the 
benefits accruing to a franchise system, and at the same time retain the benefit of being able to control the ultimate 
disposition of those goods. So you have to make a decision, either you have an independent distribution system or you don't. . . . In the long run it 
[Schwinn] will probably be more beneficial to the smaller businessman than it will be harmful. Panel Discussion, supra note 7, at 56 (remarks of S. Jerry Cohen). Therefore, with the elimination of the location clause from franchise contracts, the freedom of dealers as to where and to 
whom they will sell will be increased. This probably will lead only to sporadic changes in the distribution pattern and will not 
affect the viability of the franchised distribution system. The principal result of the demise of the location will be the "
807,," preservation of the dealer's freedom to do business. At least in some areas, intrabrand competition will be enhanced, and 
the manufacturers' stifling of intrabrand competition will be replaced by the operation of market forces. Schmitt, supra note 13, at 909. "

843,4," As Professors Wright and Miller emphasize, a Rule 42(b) motion for ""separate trials"" presents considerations distinct from a 
Rule 21 motion for ""severance"" and the terms ""separate trials"" and ""severance"" should not be used interchangeably. 9 WRIGHT 
& MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE: CIVIL § 2387, at 277 (1971). "
844,5," At a second in-chambers conference, the Court asked counsel for both sides to suggest a proper trial format so as to avoid 
confusing the jury with the introduction of evidence by defendant under the guise of rebuttal which was actually evidence of 
purportedly ""unclean hands"" conduct of the plaintiffs.  The Court was concerned that despite the striking of affirmative defenses 
and a separation of trials to avoid prejudice and confusion, defendant would still be able to introduce evidence of ""unclean 
hands"" and in pari delicto during plaintiffs' case-in-chief. Neither side was able to suggest a suitable method for segregating the presentation of such potentially confusing testimony.  
Defendant contended that the proof in this case would require application of a ""rule of reason"" to its conduct to determine 
whether it had violated the antitrust laws, necessitating in its view the introduction of evidence as to plaintiffs' conduct in 
promulgating parallel pricing schemes to present the proper economic background so that the jury could ascertain the 
""reasonableness"" of defendant's conduct.  Plaintiffs pointed out that one of the primary components of their case would be proof 
of the fact of damages suffered by them allegedly as the result of defendant's alleged anticompetitive conduct.  They therefore 
felt that bifurcation of trial--for example, into separate stages to resolve first liability and then damages--was not workable in view 
of the necessary elements they had to prove to get their case to a jury. On this basis, the Court at this time makes no effort to establish an appropriate order of presentation of proof at trial.  Such a 
resolution undoubtedly will be necessary at a later time.  As stated above in the description of the applicability of defendant's 
evidence to plaintiffs' case-in-chief, see Part IV.C.4.c., supra, some of the potentially confusing evidence is apparently relevant 
to the issue of causation of damages.  The propriety of a ""reasonableness"" defense cannot be resolved on the present record. 
Also, the Court recognizes that while plaintiffs could introduce (as they indicated at the conference in-chambers) evidence to 
establish a prima facie case of a per se price fixing scheme solely out of the mouths of defendant's officers, employees and 
customers, as a tactical matter they might not wish to limit their presentation in this manner, but would prefer to have the jury 
also hear testimony from their witnesses as to the allegedly deleterious effects of defendant's alleged anticompetitive scheme. "
847,6," The Advisory Committee noted the various problems attendant to the use of an adverse party's expert information in its notes 
to the Proposed Rule 26(b)(4)(B).  See 43 F.R.D. 211, 234-35 (1967). The Advisory Committee emphasized the danger of 
prohibiting discovery of information held by expert witnesses which could undercut effective cross-examination where the "
848,," particular approach that an adversary's expert can utilize cannot properly be anticipated or documented, while at the same time 
recognizing that in solving the problem, the Court should be requiring a party to prepare his own case in advance, and not out of 
the mouth of the adversary's expert.  43 F.R.D. at 235. "
849,7," The Court notes that this result as to defendant's first two requests is not only permissible on these facts under Rule 
26(b)(4)(B) but is also totally in accord with the policy established by Rule 34 as stated above, see 8 Wright & Miller, supra § 
2218.  Such a result also comports with the policy suggested by the panelists for the trial of complex civil cases such as this one.  
See Manual for Complex Litigation, 1 J. Moore, Federal Practice, Part 2, § 2.715 (2d ed. 1975). Further, such a result is consonant with the decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Second and Third Circuits in 
the only decisions that the Court could find which presented analogous situations: Liebert, supra, 519 F.2d 542; Dioguardi, 
supra, 428 F.2d 1033; and Kelly, supra, 420 F.2d 26. Those cases did not involve requests for discovery of computer information 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B) but were rather requests made by accused persons for the right to test the validity of computer 
results or scientific examinations prior to the trial of criminal cases.  To that extent, the cases can be analogized to the instant 
situation because a court in a criminal case would be considering whether a situation presented circumstances arguably parallel 
to the ""exceptional circumstances"" required to be found in the civil context.  Cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). In Liebert, the defendant was charged with failing to file income tax returns.  The Government relied heavily upon the computer 
evidence from the appropriate regional Internal Revenue Service center which reflected that defendant's name was absent from 
the list of persons who had submitted returns for the years in question, and appeared instead on a list of persons who were 
designated as not having filed.  Defendant sought to discover these lists and to ascertain the manner in which they had been 
prepared by the computer. Although holding that the IRS offer of alternative information satisfied defendant's request and avoided the danger of an invasion 
of the privacy of other taxpayers (or non-taxpayers) whose names appeared on the list, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals 
agreed with defendant (and cited the Manual for Complex Litigation for the proposition) that he was entitled to have access to 
the computerized information in some form to permit proper pre-trial preparation: ""A party seeking to impeach the reliability of computer evidence should have sufficient opportunity to ascertain by pretrial 
discovery whether both the machine and those who supply it with data input and information have performed their tasks 
accurately."" "
849,519," F.2d at 547. The defendants in Dioguardi were charged with committing fraud in connection with the assets and property of a bankrupt in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 152. A government witness had testified at trial after instructing a computer to prepare figures furnished 
by another witness which were designated to reveal the nature of fraud in connection with the assets.  428 F.2d at 1037. The 
computer expert had no independent knowledge of any of the facts that he used to instruct the computer and totally relied for his 
facts upon the recollection of the other witness.  The Government failed to produce this computer program.  Commenting on this 
failure, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated: ""We fully agree that the defendants were entitled to know what operations the computer had been instructed to perform and 
to have the precise instruction that had been given. . . .  We place the Government on the clearest possible notice . . . of the "
850,," great desirability of making the program and other materials needed for cross- examination of computer witnesses, such as 
flow-charts used in the preparation of programs, available to the defense a reasonable time before trial."" "
850,428," F.2d at 1038 citing United States v. Kelly, supra, 420 F.2d 26. Kelly was a narcotics case in which the Government presented an expert witness who testified at trial as to the presence of the 
narcotics in defendant's possession discovered by the expert through the use of a new testing device called a ""neutron 
activation"" device, which supplemented or supplanted information generated through reliance upon more conventional chemical 
analyses.  420 F.2d at 28. The Government had refused to disclose to defendants the design or reliance upon the new device 
and its results before trial.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that such a refusal required reversal of the convictions. Nothing that the use of a new test of this caliber to supplant prior test results is permissible, the Court of Appeals went on to 
make several observations as to why such new methods had to be disclosed fully to the defendants in advance of trial: ""It is important that the defense be given a chance to research the techniques and results of scientific tests taken by the 
government. . . .  [The government] chose to bolster this already quite strong case by a concededly new and, to any trier, 
quite dramatic demonstration of a method of determining trace elements in a substance[.] . . . Fairness requires that 
adequate notice be given the defense to check the findings and conclusions of the government's experts."" "
850,420, F.2d at 28-29.
850,8," The question of ""alternative claims"" was considered by Judge McVicar in a somewhat analogous context in the first case to 
formulate the ""fairness"" doctrine on which Rule 26(b)(4) is based, Lewis v. United Air Lines Transport Corp., supra, 32 F. Supp. 
21, a case brought to recover for damages sustained in an aviation accident where one aspect of the controversy was the role in 
the accident by an airplane engine cylinder. In commenting upon the proper scope of discovery of the expert as to his findings 
concerning the cylinder, the court stated, 32 F. Supp. at 23: ""If it should appear, however, that [the expert] made changes in the cylinder, he should tell what those changes were; he 
should describe the appearance of the cylinder prior thereto and after the changes were made; furthermore, if he made any 
tests of the cylinder which cannot be repeated now with the same results because of the changes he has made, he should 
describe such tests and the results thereof."" (Emphasis added)  Discovery of Dr. Massy on ""alternative claims"" would be proper in this case on the Lewis rationale and the rationale utilized by 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in United States v. Kelly, supra, 420 F.2d at 29. See note 7, supra. "

In People v. Santa Clara Valley Bowling etc. Assn. (1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 225 [47 Cal.Rptr. 570], the Court of Appeal labeled as 
a per se violation a bowling proprietors' association rule providing that bowlers could compete in association tournaments only if 
they bowled a certain number of league games in member houses.  The court found that such a rule was intended to coerce 
bowlers into abandoning nonmember establishments and frequent those owned by members. Silver v. New York Stock Exchange (1963) 373 U.S. 341 [10 L.Ed.2d 389, 83 S.Ct. 1246], is also sometimes cited to show the 
general applicability of the per se rule. In that case, two Texas over-the -counter brokers and dealers in securities arranged with 
members of the New York Stock Exchange for direct telephone connections with a number of firms.  The exchange told the firms 
to disconnect the telephones, substantially damaging the business of the Texans.  The court found that the Sherman Act was 
violated, although its rationale is not entirely clear.  While the opinion begins with language indicating the finding of a per se 
violation, the court then proceeds to examine and reject various justifications for the exchange's practice and also attacks the 
lack of procedural due process granted the plaintiffs.  The latter part of the decision has led at least two commentators to 
conclude that Silver applied the rule of reason. (Note, Trade Association Exclusionary Practices: An Affirmative Role for the Rule 
of Reason (1966) 66 Colum.L.Rev. 1486, 1487-1488; The Supreme Court, 1962 Term (1963) 77 Harv.L.Rev. 62, 156.) Others "
957,," have interpreted Silver as a per se case, a circumstance which justifies the criticism of one writer that ""The judgment of history 
must surely be that the courts and the legal profession have been far more successful in the results achieved in antitrust cases 
than in their efforts to articulate the ideas involved."" (Rahl, Per Se Rules and Boycotts Under the Sherman Act: Some 
Reflections on the Klor's Case (1959) supra, 45 Va.L.Rev. 1165, 1168.)"
957,10," We recognize that in rejecting a per se rule in this case we are sacrificing some advantages, i.e., the facilitation of judicial 
certainty and the saving of litigation costs.  ( Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) supra, 356 U.S. 1, 5.) But the cost 
need not be significant.  If a particular regulation is declared invalid under the rule of reason, both the courts and parties in a 
future case may contemplate that a similar rule in a comparable industry having like economic effects will also be held invalid.  
Adoption of the rule of reason does not preclude application of the doctrine of stare decisis. "
958,11," Although this case deals primarily with a salesman, we see no reason to distinguish between a salesman and a broker with 
respect to the access rule.  Nonmember brokers, like nonmember salesmen, are of course denied access to the multiple listing 
service and are thus injured by the rule to the same extent as salesmen. Moreover, the possible justifications for both rules -- 
insuring professional and ethical competence and preserving autonomy over provision of benefits and membership selection -- 
apply equally to both groups.  The only difference between the two groups is in the injury caused by the ""primarily engaged"" rule.  
While part-time brokers are excluded from membership by a separate ""primarily engaged"" bylaw, such exclusion does not 
prevent them from earning a living to the same extent that it reacts upon salesmen, who may not sell real estate unless 
employed by a broker."
958,12," It is not necessary for Palsson to prove that many brokers and salesmen have actually left the real estate field or declined to 
enter because of failure to obtain membership. When, as in the present case, a practice has a tendency to restrain trade, it may 
violate antitrust law, ""whether it be 'wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.'"" ( Id., at p. 12 [89 
L.Ed. at p. 2026].) "
959,13," We emphasize that the question before us concerns the validity of the ""primarily engaged"" rule in conjunction with other board 
bylaws effectively denying employment to nonmember salesmen. The question of availability of judicial review for an exclusion 
from membership, absent the access rule and the employment rules, is not before us. "
962,1," The plaintiffs have at no time requested a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.  While there was mention at 
oral argument of a then-impending May 3, 1976, deadline for entry of the advertisement into the 1976 St. Paul Yellow Pages, the 
plaintiffs' request for the injunctive relief sought in their complaint has at no time been ripe for disposition."
962,2," In setting forth the § 1983 claim, the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to support their conclusory allegation that the 
defendants are acting ""under color of state law."" The defendants' obedience of the State statute discussed in the text does not 
rise to the status of action ""under color of state law"" for purposes of § 1983.  The fourth cause of action, apparently bottomed on 
§ 1985, fails to allege the class-based animus necessary to state a claim under that statute.  See Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 
U.S. 88, 101-02 (1971); Turbak v. Haines, 4-75-Civil 42 (D. Minn. December 31, 1975), at Slip Op. 8 n. 5."
962,3," There, ""the Supreme Court held that Congress did not intend the Sherman Act to apply to state agents acting in furtherance of 
state policies or to private parties acting under the direction of state law."" Note, The State Action Exemption and Antitrust 
Enforcement Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1976). As the Supreme Court has subsequently 
noted, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 775 (1975), this has been referred to as the ""state action doctrine."" Stated in "
963,," another way, the doctrine holds that the Sherman Act ""was intended to regulate private practices and not to prohibit a State from 
imposing a restraint as an act of government."" Id.  at 788. "
964,4," The Supreme Court's recent ruling in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., No. 74-895 
(May 24, 1976), invalidating on First Amendment grounds a State statute which prohibited advertising of prescription drug prices, 
was on direct appeal from a three-judge district court.  See Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. v. Virginia State Board of 
Pharmacy, 373 F. Supp. 683 (E.D. Va. 1974). That case demonstrates the procedure which must be followed where a plaintiff 
seeks to invalidate a State statute upon the ground of its conflict with the First Amendment."
964,5," Similarly, a local commentator in discussing the present case asks rhetorically ""[would] not a reference to divorce… in a 
reputable law list be as violative of M.S.A. Section 518.29… as would an identical listing in the Yellow Pages?"" Wheeler, 
""Attorneys Ask to Let Fingers Do Walking,"" 2 Quaere 1, 3 (May 1976)."
964,6," The statute was enacted in 1901.  The plaintiffs make no claim that the defendants conspired with anyone to bring about the 
enactment of the statute.  In any event, such conduct would most likely be insulated from antitrust liability under the doctrine of 
Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961)."
964,7," Publication of an inoperative telephone number would not assure to the defendants immunity from prosecution under M.S.A.  § 
518.29, so long as the advertisement continued to contain sufficient information enabling the public to respond to the 
advertisement. For example, any firm name disclosed in the advertisement and traceable through the ""White Pages"" would be 
analogous to the indirect communication achieved by the newspaper box in Giantvalley."
964,8," Portions of the plaintiffs' brief are inconsistent with their affidavit and more consistent with the allegations of the complaint.  For 
example, the brief states: ""At no time did Defendant… give as a reason for their refusal to accept or publish Plaintiffs' advertisement that the advertisement 
is or may be violative of state law.  Had Defendant raised this argument before its deadline for the acceptance of Classified 
Yellow Pages advertisements had expired, Plaintiffs would have agreed to modify their advertisement accordingly…."" This is 
inconsistent with the affidavit's allegation that the plaintiffs had in fact agreed to so modify their advertisement. "
965,9," See EC 2-9, 2-10 and 2-14, and DR 2-101 and 2-102.  If the Minnesota Supreme Court were to adopt the amendments to the 
Code of Professional Responsibility suggested by the House of Delegates of the ABA on February 17, 1976, the abbreviated 
version of the advertisement would apparently conform to State law.  See 62 ABA Journal 470 (April 1976)."
965,10," The plaintiffs also assert in their brief that ""many of the Code sections cited by defendants are… subject to First Amendment 
attack."" This argument is not properly before this Court for the reasons set forth in the text with respect to the other allegations of 
unconstitutionality. The same is true of any constitutionally-based claim that the Minnesota legislature has improperly delegated 
its lawmaking function to ""a private club headquartered in Chicago."" Wheeler, supra, note 5 at 3. "
966,11," See note 9, supra."
966,12," The Court notes, however, that the reasoning employed here to prevent attorneys - who are subject to the Code - from suing 
defendants under the antitrust laws may not be applicable to a case in which the plaintiffs are non-lawyers.  The Court 
expresses no opinion as to the merits of a hypothetical antitrust suit commenced by nonlawyers against advertising entities such 
as the defendants. "
968,13," Another commentator has also noted that: ""… a holding that the Sherman Act applied to the states would void state legislation without ensuring that Congress would 
adequately deal with those local situations where a regime of competition was inapposite."" Note, supra note 3 at 721.  An 
example of such a law might be one requiring that attorneys be licensed before being permitted to practice in a State. "
974,1," Cf.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 120 n. 15, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969). "
975,2," In Duff, the plaintiff had no business at all whereas in the instant case the plaintiff is an actual competitor with the defendant in 
several product areas and has an ongoing business; the plaintiff in Duff did not presently own the equipment necessary for 
competition nor did he have business resources in active operation whereas Fleer has alleged that its ongoing business 
enterprise includes many of the manufacturing and marketing operations that would be used in the manufacture and sale of 
baseball trading cards. "
977,3," At the next pretrial conference in this case the court will establish a discovery schedule and entertain requests for scheduling 
summary judgment motions. "
978,4," Including those which negate Fleer's contentions that there have been changed conditions since 1965 which defeat collateral 
estoppel. See Greene v. General Foods Corp., 517 F.2d 635, 659 (5th Cir. 1975)."
978,5," See Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco Corp., 494 F.2d 840, 844 (3d Cir. 1974), Ct. International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. 
v. General Telephone and Electrics Corp., 380 F. Supp. 976 (M.D. N.C. 1974). Cf. Note, Collateral Estoppel of Nonparties, 87 
Narv. L. Rev. 1485 (1974)."
978,6," 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a) reads: ""(a) A final judgment or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf 
of the United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie 
evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said 
laws or by the United States under section 15a of this title, as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree 
would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto: Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgments or 
decrees entered before any testimony has been taken or to judgments or decrees entered in actions under section 15a of 
this title. """
978,7," Section 5b, 15 U.S.C. 16(b), tolled the statute of limitations on the private actions pending the government initiated 
proceedings. "
979,8," However, an FTC finding of a violation of sec. 5(a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act is not an antitrust decree. The FTC 
Act is not enumerated in section 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 12, as an ""antitrust law."" In State of North Carolina v. 
Charles Pfizer & Co., supra, the Fourth Circuit noted that the scope of liability under the FTC Act is broader than under the 
Clayton Act."
979,9," But see United States v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 205 F. Supp. 94, 96 (S.D. N.Y. 1962)."
979,10," The court's reading of the legislative history agrees with the thesis of the commentary, section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 8 U. of 
San Francisco L. Rev. 74 (1973)."
979,11," In Rachal, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint for an injunction which led to an adjudication that the 
defendant had violated the securities laws.  Subsequently, a private party -- a stranger to the SEC action -- brought a damage 
action against the defendant and asserted the adverse determination of liability in the former action against the defendant.  In 
the injunctive action the defendant had no jury trial right; in the damage action it did.  Allowing the plaintiff to use the judgment 
from the first case as an estoppel in the second would defeat the jury trial right.  This, the court reasoned, presented an 
""overriding consideration of fairness,"" Bruszewski v. U.S., 181 F.2d 419, 421 (3d Cir. 1950), which precluded collateral estoppel. 
In the instant case, Fleer has expressly waived its right to a jury trial, so Rachal is distinguishable. "
980,12," The defendants' position may be sui generis.  It is infrequent that a defendant can make a plausible claim that the plaintiff had 
a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence and arguments in an FTC proceeding brought on a commission complaint.  The 
initial decision of the Hearing Examiner lends substance to Topps' claim.  It states, inter alia: Fleer's representatives were star witnesses and, in proportion, carried the burden of making the record in this proceeding.  
They were in constant attendance throughout the hearing. . . .  In retrospect, much of the struggle for contracts with 
ballplayers seems to be Fleer's private struggle with Topps. . . .  The Hearing Examiner is, however, of the opinion that the 
delegation of the Commission's ""adjudicative fact-finding functions"" does not embrace a policy question going to the public 
interest.  67 F.T.C. at 777."
980,13," We note (without endorsement) that a selective application of collateral estoppel whereby antitrust plaintiffs could use it but 
defendants could not, would be consistent with the plaintiff bias in 15 U.S.C. § 16a. Hence, the pre-emption issue presents the 
alternatives of preemption; no pre-emption; and selective pre-emption. "
983,1," The Honorable Robert W. Warren, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, is sitting by designation. "
984,2, The full text of the noncompetition clause reads:
984,5," .  During the term of this agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination of his employment 
hereunder, whether by lapse of time or by termination as hereinafter provided, Stoner shall not directly or indirectly, in any 
of the territories in which the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates is at present conducting business and also in 
territories which Stoner knows the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates intends to extend and carry on business by 
expansion of present activities, enter into or engage in the vending machine manufacturing business or any branch thereof, 
either as an individual on his own account, or as a partner or joint venturer, or as an employee, agent or salesman for any 
person, firm or corporation or as an officer or director of a corporation or otherwise, provided however that the Company, its 
subsidiaries and affiliates shall be excluded from the restrictions hereof and provided also that Stoner shall be permitted to 
own, hold, acquire and dispose of stocks and other securities which are traded in the investment security market whether 
on listed exchanges or over the counter."
984,3," In 1959 when Stoner Manufacturing sold out to Vendo it was manufacturing a candy vending machine called a ""drop shelf"" 
machine. The Phillips's machine, which became known as the ""Lektro-Vend"" model, was an extension of the ""drop shelf"" model.  
After the purchase of the Stoner assets in April 1959, Vendo began experimenting with the same idea as that developed by the 
Phillipses.  Two models were built.  Vendo, however, considered the models defective in certain mechanical respects and too 
expensive to produce.  The project was dropped. "
985,4," In an attempt to aid the reader to better understand this complex litigation and at the same time to shorten the opinion, a 
summary of the state court litigation follows.Vendo v. Harry B. Stoner and Stoner Investments, Inc. The suit was filed in Kane County, Illinois on August 10, 1965; the complaint charged breach of noncompetition covenants; an 
amended complaint also charged theft of trade secrets.  After a bench trial the court on December 16, 1966 found for Vendo.  
Judgments against Stoner for $250,000 and against both defendants for $1,100,000 were granted.  Stoner and Stoner 
Investments were enjoined from further acts of competition. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Court of Illinois.  That court entered its decision on January 30, 1969, Vendo Co. v. Stoner, 
105 Ill. App. 2d 261, 245 N.E. 2d 263. The court held that no trade secrets were involved, the noncompetition covenants were 
valid and enforceable, and the covenants had been breached by the defendants.  The grant of injunctive relief was affirmed.  
The court also held that though the trial court erred in striking the affirmative defense based on the federal antitrust laws, it was 
correct in denying the defense based on the Illinois antitrust laws. The cause was remanded for a determination of damages and 
further proceedings. Upon remand the defendant withdrew its affirmative defense asserted under the federal antitrust laws. The trial court, after 
hearing evidence entered judgments against Stoner and Stoner Investments which totaled $7,363.500. Upon a second appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court, the court decided, on September 12, 1973, Vendo Co. v. Stoner, 13 Ill. 
App. 3d 291, 300 N.E.2d 632, that the trial court erred in the measurement of damages.  The case was remanded for 
assessment of damages in accordance with the Appellate Court's original opinion. Upon appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court on September 27, 1974, Vendo Co. V. Stoner, 58 Ill. 2d 289, 321 N.E.2d 1, the 
appellate court was reversed and the trial court's judgments were affirmed.  The Supreme Court in deciding the case constructed 
a different theory of recovery - the breach of a fiduciary obligation on the part of Stoner - than had been asserted by Vendo. "

regulating the conduct of the judgment debtors during the pendency of the injunction."

] In general terms, the ""direct injury"" or ""secondary effect"" doctrine is 
based on an examination of the relationship between the claimant and the alleged antitrust violator to determine whether the 
injury is ""remote"" or ""secondary,"" rather than ""direct,"" or whether there is an intermediate person suffering a more primary harm.  
See, e.g., Billy Baxter, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 431 F.2d 183 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 923, 91 S. Ct. 877, 27 L. Ed.

60,552 (E.D.N.Y. 1975). HN7[
] The ""target area"" analysis requires a determination as to whether or not the claimant's injured commercial enterprise 
was in the target area of the economy in which the defendant's antitrust violation eliminated competition.  Conference of Studio 
Unions v. Loew's, Inc., 193 F.2d 51, 54-55 (9th Cir. 1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 919, 72 S. Ct. 367, 96 L. Ed. 687 (1952). See, 
e.g., In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, supra, (farmers alleging damage to crop yields from defendant's alleged conspiracy 
to eliminate competition in the development of automotive air pollution control devices lack standing).  Courts adopting the target 
area approach state, with some justification, that the Supreme Court's decision in Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 642, 89 
S. Ct. 1871, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1969), is supportive of their position. The Sixth Circuit has rejected both of these approaches, and applies the standing test developed by the Supreme Court in 
Assoc. of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970), to section

1016,6," In a letter to Blue Cross dated November 6, 1973, Insurance Commissioner Denenberg made the following comments about 
""free care"": ""This department cannot and will not approve the submitted cost-plus factor.  I draw your attention to several basic reasons. ""First, free care, the alleged cause of the plus factor, is not a cost connected with Blue Cross coverage . . . Blue Cross 
cannot pay for services outside of Blue Cross coverage. "
1017,," ""In short, Blue Cross, itself a nonprofit corporation, is not authorized to make contributions or gifts to hospitals in 
recognition of free services which may have been provided to the community . . .."""
1017,*," * * ""Sixth, the provisions and financing of free care service is a community problem.  Costs of free care should be shared by 
the entire community through appropriations from government funds or otherwise."" Exhibit M to Affidavit of Bruce Taylor, 
pp. 1-3."
1017,7, Uniform Cost Contract -- 1967.
1017,8," The constitutionality of this act was upheld by a three-judge court in Guest v. Fitzpatrick, 409 F. Supp. 818 (E.D. Pa. 1976), 
appeal pending.  Judge Luongo dissented from the majority opinion of Judge Weiner and Circuit Judge Van Dusen."
1017,9," Commissioner Sheppard ordered that the termination of the contracts be suspended for ninety days.  He observed that ""the parties should be able to conclude [the negotiations] successfully within the very near future. . . ."" Defendant Exhibit V, 
p.3. It would appear that Commissioner Sheppard, unlike some of his predecessors, is willing to approve a hospital contract under 
which Blue Cross bears some share of free care and bad debt costs.  He stated: "
1018,," ""It is appropriate and proper for Blue Cross, on behalf of its subscribers, to bear an appropriate portion of certain free care 
and bad debt costs of member hospitals, after crediting against such free care and bad debt costs the resources available 
to hospitals for such purposes from sources other than patient payments."" p.2."
1018,10," ""HN2[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several states . . . is declared to be illegal. . . ."""
1018,11," ""HN3[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states . . . shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor. . ."" "
1019,12," Because we conclude that § 1013(b) is inapplicable, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether Blue Cross would be entitled to 
summary judgment on the ground that its activities in the Philadelphia area did not constitute unlawful monopolization or restraint 
of trade."
1019,13," After oral argument on this motion the court granted the defendant's motion to strike plaintiff's affidavits on the ground that 
they failed to conform to the requirements of Rule 56(e).  Plaintiff was given leave to submit additional affidavits and to file a 
supplemental brief pointing out pertinent portions of deposition testimony.  Order of May 20, 1976. "
1020,14," We apply emphasis to the word ""primarily"" because we do not believe section 1013(b) should be strictly limited to the classic 
situation of insurance company blacklisting.  In appropriate circumstances, the language of that provision would reach other 
practices which have the same purpose and effect as blacklisting or which are equally pernicious in violating the most 
fundamental notions of competition and fair play.  In the instant case we are not presented with circumstances that require us to 
decide this issue.  But see Addrisi v. Equitable Life Insurance Society, 503 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 929, 
43 L. Ed. 2d 400, 95 S. Ct. 1129 (1975)."
1020,15," We note, however, that Frankford Hospital contends that Blue Cross has used its existing contractual relationships with the 
hospitals by intentionally withholding large sums of money which it owes to the hospitals in order to coerce them into signing a 
new contract."
1020,16," The omitted footnote in the above quoted passage stated, ""If a hospital refused to agree to the contract, Blue Cross would reimburse the hospital on a per diem basis by an amount 
insufficient to cover the hospital's costs.  A hospital would have to make up any deficiency by charging the patient directly.  
We note that this procedure is typical of the indemnification plans offered by private insurance companies."" "

1021,19," The following exchange in the Mullen deposition illustrates the small role played by Blue Cross representatives: ""By Mr. Bogus [plaintiff's counsel]: Mr. Mullen, did you have occasion to discuss this matter with any one else at Blue Cross 
other than Mr. Gannon? Mr. Mullen: No, I have a very hard time getting anyone at Blue Cross to talk to me."" Deposition p. 14."
1021,20,"  ""Mr. Bogus: Did anyone at Blue Cross tell you that non-participating hospitals were likely to harass or pester your 
members?  [Objected to by Blue Cross counsel] "
1022,," Mr. McGuire: No.  The hospitals have did it, though.  The hospitals have did it.  They have harassed and pestered our 
members. Q: Have you discussed that problem with anyone at Blue Cross? A: To the point where, you know what's happening, has there been anything done through negotiations or stuff like that."" 
McGuire Deposition p. 9."
1022,21," See supra, at p. 1108"
1022,22," In declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction we have also considered that it is extremely unlikely that we would ever decide the 
merits of the state law claims in plaintiff's favor.  Only a novel state law argument could defeat the otherwise obvious conclusion 
that Pennsylvania common law doctrines of unfair competition have been preempted by the statutes establishing nonprofit 
hospital plans and providing for their regulation; and by Act 94.  However, before we would base a decision on a novel state law 
claim we would abstain so that that decision could be made, if at all, in the state courts.  Thus, had we exercised pendent 
jurisdiction the best result the plaintiff could have expected would have been for the court to abstain.  Thus it is made no worse 
off by our failure to exercise pendent jurisdiction. "

1057,1," The agreement was actually one between ""PLOUGH"" and ""STUART,"" as those terms were defined in the agreement.  Since 
The Stuart Company was later acquired by Atlas Chemical Industries, Inc., which in turn was later acquired by ICI, America, Inc.,

the Plough-Atlas 1961 license. Our examination of the trial record and statements of counsel therein satisfies us that while the 
primary thrust of the case presented may have been claimed per se illegality of the Plough-Atlas agreement, the alternative 
theory was not eliminated."

1066,6," Throughout this discussion we are merely indicating that which a jury might have determined to be facts demonstrating illegal 
combination and do not intend in any way to indicate that such is what would have been found if the case had gone to the jury. "
1082,1," It is a matter of some amusement to note that this widely recognized principle is one for which it is difficult to find explicit 
precedent above the district court level.  Yet, it must be Hornbook Law because the existence of a conflict between the decisions 
of the Courts of Appeal in two or more Circuits provides a major basis for the grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court.  See for 
example, Bruning v. United States, 376 U.S. 358, at pp. 359-360, 11 L. Ed. 2d 772, 84 S. Ct. 906 (1964). That the district courts are bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeals of their own Circuit is evidenced by Massaro v. 
United States Lines Co., 198 F. Supp. 845 (DC-Pa. 1961), aff'd, 307 F.2d 299 (CA-3, 1962).  The Court of Appeals adhered to 
its earlier decision, by which the district court ruled it was bound, but made no mention of the principle (as it need not have since 
it was free to change its mind). "
1083,," John Deere Co. v. Graham, 333 F.2d 529 (CA-8 1964), seems to be one of the few rulings at that level which states the 
principle and which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, 383 U.S. 1, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966), but, again, without 
mention of the principle. "
1086,2," The traditional concepts of a ""relevant market"" and of ""market shares"" within it obviously have little significance in the maritime 
shipping industry. By Congressional and administrative policy under § 15 of the Shipping Act, agreements of all kinds except the 
one-time merger or acquisition of assets may be entered into with FMC approval.  It was evidently the philosophy of the 
Alexander Report, on which the Supreme Court relied heavily for its ruling in the Seatrain case, supra, that the then widespread 
practice of entering into all manner of operating agreements be allowed to continue, rather than be forbidden, but subject to 
regulation.  Consequently, all manner of agreements that would otherwise be per se violations of the antitrust laws are exempted 
from them and sanctioned.  These include agreements to fix rates (prices), allocation and division of markets, pooling 
arrangements, and other cooperative arrangements between competitors at the same market level (horizontal). This means that the ""market"" at any time bears no reasonable resemblance to a free, open and competitive market, but rather is 
one that is severely distorted by this wide array of sanctioned agreements.  See the testimony of the court-appointed expert 
witness, Dr. Jules Backman, Exh. C-2 at pp. 63-66. This distortion is further aggravated if the market analysis is confined to U.S. flag carriers, as the United States urges.  Within 
this group of carriers, other policies and practices of the United States itself intrude.  Thus, carriers who receive an operating 
differential subsidy are required to serve specified trade routes, and may not compete with unsubsidized carriers on other routes 
without special permission.  Similarly, the charter by Military Sealift Command of the 14 cargo ships of U.S. Lines subtracts "
1087,," whatever cargo they carry from what would otherwise be part of the ""relevant market,"" which the so-called ""bidding system"" for 
Department of Defense cargo, in which negotiations follow the bidding, and under which the lowest bidder gets no more than 
50% of the cargo, adds to the crazy-quilt pattern.  Exh. GX-36 shows that in quite a few cases, most of the cargo was carried by 
other than the lowest bidder, presumably because it lacked space to handle it.  This kind of policy, for which no statutory 
authority was produced although requested by the court, suggests that a carrier with the most capacity on a given trade route is 
free to decide to bid high -- at or close to its published tariff level -- knowing that its competitors (who may decide to bid lower) 
cannot carry the cargo and that it will wind up transporting a large share of the total although it was high bidder.  This strategy 
implies no antitrust or other improper characteristic.  The policies and practices of the Military Sealift Command obviously invite 
that strategy as a matter of individual decision. A still further distorting policy is that defense cargo is to be shipped in containers. Since U.S. Lines and Sea-Land have the 
largest container capacity of the U.S. flag lines, and since those lines are to be preferred, the policy serves to concentrate the 
business in those two companies.  Yet, it is the same United States that charges the defendants with violating antitrust laws."
1087,3," The extensive testimony of officials from the Military Sealift Command, in an effort to determine the number of long-tons carried 
on various routes, showed that the theory of the United States was more like Procrustes' Bed than like the facts. A considerable mathematical exercise, studded with unproved assumptions, was performed to convert ""measurement tons"" (40 
cubic feet) into ""long tons"" (2,240 pounds).  As the report of the court-appointed expert shows, the number of long tons, the 
number of containers and the number of cubic feet of cargo is reported for each outbound and inbound sailing to the Maritime 
Administration on Form MA-578A.  See Exh. C-2, exhibits 1 and 2. The Military Sealift Command keeps figures in measurement tons only, although the manifests record weight as well as volume, 
because its payments to carriers are based only on cubic feet of cargo (measurement tons).  The exercise involved an effort to 
derive a conversion factor from measurement tons to long tons, and it was obviously unreliable.  The actual number of long-tons 
could have been obtained instead from the Maritime Administration, which does record the figures.  There is no point in climbing 
through the attic window when the front door is open. The inability of the United States to gather information in the possession of its various agencies, or to use the support of their 
technical staffs, was beyond understanding.  This deficiency was most evident when the United States informed the court that it 
was not prepared to proceed with cross-examination of a defense witness whose direct testimony it had received more than 2 
weeks before, and when it had ""no questions"" for cross-examination of other defense witnesses.  This was at a point when the 
case was more than 5 years old. The United States comes before the court on an equal basis, the same as any other party.  The responsibility expressed in F.R. 
Civ. P. 11, applies to the United States as it does to private parties.  As the party that filed the complaint, it had an obligation to 
have reasonable ground to make the allegations in it.  The evidence at trial, with some 5 years to prepare, showed that it did not. "
1088,4," This is an expression of the art of decision making, which consists of arriving at sound judgments on the basis of incomplete 
evidence. It recognizes that the actual and potential market, whether geographic or service based, is best measured by the existence and 
potential for competition. Dramatic as the container ship concept may be, looked at by itself, the implication that it is the ""be-all 
and end-all"" in marine transportation of cargo is simply not sustainable.  The system is highly specialized, requires heavy capital 
investments at fixed port locations, and so is exposed to the same risks as the dodo. The record shows that other ocean carriers have considered containerization but have decided to go another route, with barge 
carriers and roll on/roll off ships, and with unitized cargo, for example.  This gives them the capability to compete with full 
container systems while retaining a high degree of flexibility to handle other cargo and to serve ports not equipped for a full 
container system and not worth equipping.  There is obviously a limit, even though not clearly calculable, to which the 
development of full container systems can be justified, operationally and financially.  The intrusion of foreign flag competition (not 
subject to our antitrust laws) in this area could be devastating. In this context, the market shares of the two companies is relatively small, and for this reason it is highly likely that the Merger 
Agreement would have been sustained against challenge if the issue were not moot. "
1089,5," The FMC determination, 16 FMC at 216, that the parties intended the destruction, liquidation or dismemberment of U.S. Lines 
as a single common carrier as a possible result of the Supplemental Agreement, and consequently disapproving it, is unfounded.  
The court's finding here is to the contrary.  Kidde has an undoubted right, as noted, to dispose of U.S. Lines, including its 
liquidation or dismemberment.  Its right to do so is restricted by the Supplemental Agreement as a course of last resort, only if 
other means which would preserve U.S. Lines as an operating carrier are not available. The effect on trade or commerce, even if this last resort means prove unavoidable, is negligible when weighed against the 
justification.  A liquidation would hardly be likely to result in scrapping the ships. Their only probable buyers would be other 
carriers who could use them in their own operations, thus improving their own ability to compete. The form and pattern of competition might be altered but nothing suggests that it would be reduced or restrained in any 
significant way. "
1095,1," ""(b)(1) The regulation under subsection (a) of this section, to the maximum extent practicable, shall provide for -"
1095,*," * * ""(D) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry; including the priority needs to restore and foster 
competition in the producing, refining, distribution, marketing, and petrochemical sectors of such industry, and to preserve the 
competitive viability of independent refiners, small refiners, nonbranded independent marketers, and branded independent 
marketers;"
1095,*," * * ""(F) equitable distribution of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products at equitable prices among all regions and 
areas of the United States and sectors of the petroleum industry, including independent refiners, small refiners, nonbranded

1095,*," * * ""(I) minimization of economic distortion, inflexibility, and unnecessary interference with market mechanisms."" "
1098,2," Hereinafter, all references to sections in the 200 series are references to the FEA regulations found in 10 C.F.R. (January 1, 
1976), unless a contrary reference is clearly indicated in the text. "
1100,3," The sole exception to this arises in the case of ""new suppliers."" § 211.10(e).  Murphy, in accepting new customers for No. 2 
fuel oil, becomes an old supplier of new end-users and not a new supplier. § 211.9(d)."
1100,4," Moreover, plaintiffs' Section 7 claim ""is not directly involved"" in plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction; nor have Section 7 
issues been addressed by defendant's motion.  Thus, even if the Court found that both pricing conduct and marketing conduct 
were immunized from antitrust attack, the ultimate relief which defendant seeks by its motion, viz, dismissal of the complaint, 
would not be warranted. Plaintiffs' Section 7 claim is directed to Murphy's vertical integration into the Duluth and Cloquet markets.  It is clear that the 
EPAA as finally enacted was not designed to "" . . . attempt to regulate the structure of the gasoline [or heating oil] industry."" See, 
Guyer v. Cities Service Co., 381 F. Supp. 7, 10-11 (E.D. Wis. 1974) (Reynolds, J.) (and legislative history analyzed therein).  
Antitrust scrutiny of the structure of Murphy's operations in Duluth and Cloquet is not preempted by FEA regulation under the 
EPAA. "
1102,5," Plaintiffs argue that there exists no repugnancy between the price relief sought and the criminal sanctions which might be 
imposed, for defendant could comply with a pricing order by simply ceasing to sell at retail. Two considerations lead the Court to 
reject this argument. First, this position seeks to do indirectly what the plaintiffs disclaim doing directly in their preliminary injunction motion - plaintiffs 
attempt to force a restructuring of Murphy's operations in Duluth and Cloquet.  The Court finds it inappropriate indirectly to force 
a divestiture without exploring the Section 7 issues that have heretofore lain dormant in this case. Second, the price relief is broader than necessary to protect plaintiffs from defendant's allegedly predatory conduct.  The injury 
plaintiffs allege is the loss of customers to defendant, and the customer relief requested in plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary 
injunction would be clearly adequate to maintain the status quo and preserve plaintiffs' competitive viability pending final 
resolution on the merits.  Since plaintiffs seek a form of relief which is closely tailored to the nature of the harm, alleged, it is 
unnecessary to construe plaintiffs' requested price relief as an attempt to bludgeon defendant into not selling to any customers 
at all. "
1105,6," Such an interpretation of § 755(c)(5) is particularly appropriate in light of the fact that the EPAA was an emergency measure 
which was undoubtedly drafted with some haste."
1105,7, This spread is sometimes rounded to 3.65 cents. 
1106,8," The record does not disclose whether Murphy's supplying of former customers of plaintiffs has been pursuant to the ""new end-
user"" regulations or whether Murphy has simply been providing such customers with part of Murphy's surplus product.  If the 
latter is the case, there is not even a colorable argument for preemption, for the distribution of surplus product to end-users is 
done entirely at the discretion of the supplier. § 211.10(g)(5). "
1112,9," For purposes of this motion the Court has accepted as true plaintiffs' claims that they will be driven out of business in the 
relatively near future.  On the basis of this evidence, it appears that there is a dangerous probability that Murphy may succeed in 
monopolizing the Duluth and Cloquet markets. The Court notes, however, that this probability may not be so great as plaintiffs allege.  Murphy's market share appears to be 
less than 30%, and that share increased by only 5% from 1974 to 1975.Cf., Empire Gas, supra, at Slip Op. 17. "

1127,1," The complaint alleges: ""12.  On [or about April 5, 1974] defendant's agent . . . informed Kaiser Sand & Gravel that it should cease doing business with 
plaintiff and commence doing business with defendant and purchase the equipment needed for Kaiser's private two-way 
communications . . . . ""13.  In order to persuade Kaiser Sand & Gravel to do so, the defendant's agent . . . falsely and maliciously informed Kaiser 
Sand & Gravel Co. that plaintiff had failed to properly perform certain acts that were needed for Kaiser Cement to properly use 
the private two-way radio communications equipment it had purchased from plaintiff, including the securing of proper license 
from the F.C.C. ""14.  At the time that the defendant's agent . . . made the above statement, he knew it to be false and untrue, and he did it for 
the purpose of inducing Kaiser Sand & Gravel Co. to cease doing business with plaintiff and commence doing business with 
defendant. ""15.  In so doing, the defendant's agent . .. knew that Kaiser Sand & Gravel Co. would be greatly concerned with any problems 
with F.C.C. licenses and if it accepted them as true, it would be induced to cease doing business with plaintiff and commence 
doing business with defendant. ""16.  This action . . . is just the latest instance of unfair actions that the defendant has taken in its attempt to drive the plaintiff out 
of the business of providing private communications equipment and to monopolize the provision of the private two-way radio 
communications equipment to private industries and government agencies."""
1127,2," Count I seeks $2 million in damages to be trebled for violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act ($6 million); count II seeks $2 million 
in damages to be trebled for violations of the California Cartwright Act ($6 million); and count III seeks $2 million of actual 
damages and $1 million in punitive damages for violation of other state laws."
1127,3," In contrast to the allegations in plaintiff's complaint, see note 1 supra, the Deposition of Michael Lucero (docket #126), Kaiser's 
Manager of Purchasing reveals that: ""(1) Far from being false and malicious, the information provided Kaiser by Motorola concerning the deficiencies in the 
Kaiser FCC license application prepared by G.C.E. was true and accurate; "
1128,," ""(2) the deficiencies in Kaiser's applications in fact led the FCC to reject them; ""(3) no disparaging comments of any kind were ever made to Kaiser by anyone from Motorola; and ""(4) no suggestion was made that Kaiser should cease doing business with G.C.E."""
1128,4," For example, with regard to incidents involving Wellsco Data, Delta Truck Lines, Avis Rent-A-Car, Bus Express Service, and 
General Mills, the record is uncontradicted that Motorola did not engage in any unfair trade practices and was not responsible in 
any untoward manner for G.C.E.'s loss of those companies' business.  See Deposition of Ron Forney (docket #57); Deposition 
of William Bacigalupi (docket #53); Deposition of Robert Roemer (docket #64); Deposition of Jim Oates (docket #56); Deposition 
of Dale Garret (docket #48)."
1128,5," Many of these statements, either in whole or in part, recite multiple hearsay as to what Motorola salesmen told plaintiff's 
customers or other Motorola competitors, recount acts and statements of Motorola relating to different competitors of Motorola in 
different parts of the country with different primary lines of business from the plaintiff, or otherwise fail to conform with the 
requirements of rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
1129,6," HN3[
] Of course, if defendant's practices were merely competitive and not unfair, the fact that plaintiff would have to devote 
more time to obtaining sales would not constitute an actionable injury."
1129,7," HN4[
] However, to the extent that plaintiff contends the unfair practice of Motorola consisted of inducing plaintiff's customers 
to breach existing contracts with the plaintiff, the fact that the contract was not breached would prevent this particular business 
tort from being actionable.  See e.g., Charles C. Chapman Building Co. v. California Mart, 2 Cal. App. 3d 846, 853, 82 Cal. Rptr. 
830, 834 (2d Dist. 1969). However, such conduct could be actionable as unjustifiable interference with advantageous business 
relations.  Id. at 855, 82 Cal. Rptr. at 836. "
1130,8," While this court notes that depositions are genuinely more trustworthy than affidavits, and that the factfinder is more likely to 
believe the statements of an impartial witness than an interested one, we are unwilling to depart from the general rule that 
questions of credibility are sufficient to raise material questions of fact for purposes of rule 56.  See 6 Moore's Federal Practice, 
para. 56.15[4] (2d Ed. 1976)."
1130,9," The affiant's account of this incident is slightly different at deposition (compare docket #96(a) with docket #145); but for 
purposes of this motion, the court will draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff wherever possible."
1130,10," These statements (docket #72(b)) are inconsistent with those contained in the affidavit of Motorola salesman Steven Muir 
(docket #103(a)); however, for the purposes of this motion we must accept Mr. Cisne's version as true."
1130,11," The statements in this affidavit (docket #95) are contradicted by those of the affidavit of Motorola salesman Frank Kerba 
(docket #103(b)), who indicates that there was no suggestion that Denalect break any agreement; however, for purposes of this 
motion, the court will assume plaintiff's version of the facts are correct. "
1131,12," These statements (docket #85(b)) are somewhat inconsistent with the affidavit of Motorola salesman Tuthill (docket #103(d)) 
and with a later deposition of Mr. Cuyler (docket #150).  However, for purposes of this motion, we will draw all inferences in favor 
of plaintiff wherever possible."
1131,13," The statements contained in Mr. Bloat's affidavit (docket #41(a)) are contradicted by statements he made in a subsequent 
deposition (docket #151) and by the affidavit of Motorola salesman Bronson (docket #103(c)), which Bloat supports at his 
deposition. Nevertheless, for purposes of this motion all inferences will be drawn in favor of plaintiff wherever possible."
1131,14," This statement (docket #33(a)) is contradicted in a later deposition of Mr. Kennedy (docket #144) when he testifies that he 
cannot recall any request that he break contractual relationships with G.C.E.  However, for purposes of this motion, we will draw 
all inferences in favor of plaintiff wherever possible."
1131,15," Mann's deposition (docket #64) contradicts this part of Long's testimony (docket #71); however, for purposes of this motion, 
we assume that plaintiff's version of the facts is correct. "
1132,16," At deposition (docket #143), Mr. George testified that there was no specific request for him to break a contract and no 
disparagement of G.C.E.'s goods and services.  (Compare docket #105(b).) However, for purposes of this motion, the court will 
draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff wherever possible."
1132,17," Also somewhat relevant are the statements of some of Motorola's other competitors and the deposition of Mr. Ernest 
Luckhardt, a former Motorola sales manager, which together indicate that it is a standard Motorola practice to inspect F.C.C. 
licenses and applications in order to find out which businesses are considering the purchase of radio equipment and then to 
approach those businesses and to try to sell them Motorola equipment.  However, given the voluminous record before us, this 
court neither has the space nor inclination to catalogue every factual question which would have to be proved at trial.  Examples 
of the type of factual questions which, though established, and arguably relevant to this motion, this court nevertheless chose 
not to report are plaintiff's charges that when plaintiff informed Motorola of the existence of radio interference between plaintiff's 
customers and Motorola's customers, Motorola waited some period of time before taking steps to correct the problem.  See e.g., 
Affidavit of Bill Rippee (docket #38(b)). To be sure, the record also reflects many instances in which plaintiff's assertions were completely unsupported by admissible 
evidence or completely contradicted by the supporting papers of the defendant.  For example, the depositions of Messrs.  Corbin 
(docket #52) and Dunaway (docket #50) of G.C.E. contain at least 15 allegations of further unfair practices of Motorola of which 
there is no evidence except for the hearsay statements which those G.C.E. officials report in their depositions. See also note 4 
supra.  Especially noteworthy is plaintiff's failure to submit any evidence to substantiate its allegation that defendant engaged in 
predatory pricing.  Significantly, plaintiff has not responded to defendant's assertion that plaintiff has completely abandoned its 
predatory pricing allegation, and plaintiff's closing brief, which lists the material facts that it has shown to be in dispute, fails to 
mention defendant's practice of predatory pricing or any supposed Robinson-Patman violations that it had previously claimed the 
defendant engaged in.  See also note 26 infra."

the court wrote: HN9[
] ""To establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize a part of trade or commerce under section 2 of the Sherman Act, it would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the 
product involved.  Without a definition of that market there is no way to measure Food Machinery's ability to lessen or destroy 
competition."" 382 U.S. at 177. "
1135,25," HN13[
] It also appears that an inference of specific intent to monopolize does not have to be made with regard to a particular relevant market. In Lessig, the court held that since section 2 prohibits attempts to monopolize ""any part"" of interstate 
commerce, the relevant market was not in issue.  327 F.2d at 474. See also United States v. Yellow Cab, 332 U.S. 218, 91 L. 
Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 (1947). This part of the Lessig holding, although rarely followed in other jurisdictions, see note 23 
supra, still appears to be the law in this jurisdiction.  Thus, in an attempt to monopolize action, the determination of a relevant 
market becomes necessary only when it is essential to prove a defendant's dangerous probability of success by a showing of 
market power."
1135,26," The complaint also alleges that defendant engaged in predatory pricing on several occasions.  However, the only evidence 
which plaintiff has submitted that even alludes to this charge are the assertions of its president Walter Corbin, that the defendant 
outbid plaintiff for several accounts by offering large discounts from its list price, and the affidavit of the president of Palomar 
Communications in Escondido, California, describing how Motorola increased its sales force in Escondido, and offered large 
discounts from its list price with the result that Palomar lost a large share of its business and was forced to cut prices itself. In both these instances there is absolutely no indication that Motorola's discounts were below cost.  With regard to plaintiff's 
claim that Motorola's conduct in Escondido violated the Robinson-Patman Act, even if true, it would not be relevant to this action 
as plaintiff has no standing to raise a violation of the antitrust laws that it is completely unaffected by.  And while in some cases, 
courts have inferred an intent to monopolize from repeated violations of the Robinson-Patman Act, see e.g., Power 
Replacements Corp. v. Air Preheater Co. Inc., 356 F. Supp. 872 (E.D. Pa. 1973) the inference that could be drawn from one 
possible violation in a market in which plaintiff does not participate, even when considered with defendant's other alleged unfair 
practices, is not sufficient to show an intent to monopolize. "
1136,27," In addition, it was clear that there was a dangerous probability of success, both defendants in effect already possessing 
monopoly power."
1136,28," The court particularly objected to this latter implication as the evidence was clear that the defendants were making 50% to 
60% profit on each sale.  356 F. Supp. at 891."
1136,29," In fact, it is not clear exactly what inference the court drew from defendant's unfair practices.  Although there is dicta in the 
court's opinion to indicate that such conduct would have been sufficient to show the specific intent necessary to constitute an 
attempt to monopolize claim, the defendant was actually found guilty of monopolization not attempt to monopolize. Thus, 
defendant's disparagement and other unfair acts were technically used only to infer the willful acquisition and maintenance of 
monopoly power and not a specific intent to monopolize. This distinction is significant because while the two concepts are 
closely related, they are not identical and there are instances in which certain conduct could be found to satisfy the former 
requirement and not the latter.  See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) (holding that it is 
impermissible for a firm with monopoly power to grow with the market thereby depriving would-be entrants of the tempting 
invitation to fill unfilled demand.) See also Cooper supra note 22 at 389-392."

1137,," ""Every contract, combination, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . . "" Although section 1 was clearly directed against only ""concerted activity,"" relying on theories of ""intraenterprise"" conspiracies or 
so-called ""thin"" conspiracies among corporations associated in one business enterprise, many courts have permitted what 
appears to be single-firm competitive behavior to be litigated under section 1 of the Sherman Act. See Whitten v. Paddock Pool

1138,38," For example, Mr. Dunaway, General Sales Manager of General Communications Engineering, contends that defendant's act 
of contacting Michael Lucero of Kaiser Sand & Gravel and informing him that the F.C.C. license prepared for him by G.C.E. was 
incorrect is actionable.  Plaintiff contends that such action unnecessarily cost G.C.E. approximately two weeks of time and 
possibly some of the confidence of its customer. Similarly, plaintiff complains of an instance in which a Motorola salesman 
mentioned to the manager of Laird's Office and Supply, a ""customer"" of plaintiff, that he had noted that a Laird's license 
application had just been filed with the F.C.C.  This came as a surprise to the manager who had been told by Mr. Dunaway that 
the application had been filed some two months earlier.  As a result of the Motorola salesman's remark, Laird's contacted G.C.E. 
and discovered that there had been an error and that the application had only just been filed.  This distressed Laird's, and 
despite G.C.E.'s assurances that they would try and expedite matters, Laird's invited Motorola to submit a proposal, which was 
ultimately declined.  Plaintiff contends that it should be compensated for the time that it had to spend with Laird's recementing its 
order. "
1139,39," It cannot be overlooked, for instance, in the Kaiser Sand & Gravel incident, that Kaiser was grateful that Motorola had correctly 
pointed out a problem which Kaiser might have in securing F.C.C. licenses. Indeed, Kaiser regarded Motorola's comments as a 
service -- one which would not have been received were plaintiff's contentions to prevail.  Deposition of Michael Lucero, pp. 11-
12 (docket #126).  Similarly, were it not for Motorola's comment to the manager of Laird's Office Supply, that business might

1139,42," In point of fact, were this court actually required to reach this issue, we might be forced to defer our decision until the parties 
supplied further information on the relevant product and geographic markets.  However, for purposes of this discussion, we 
assume that the relevant product market consists of all private two-way radio communications equipment and that the relevant 
geographic market consists of the Bay Area and Northern California, the area in which plaintiff admits to do virtually almost all of 
its business.  See deposition of Walter F. Corbin at pp. 17-18 (docket #52). It must be remembered that plaintiff's attempt claim is predicated upon defendant's use of alleged unfair practices against it 
pursuant to a plan to drive it from the marketplace.  Accordingly, it would appear that the relevant geographic marketplace to 
which this court should look is the marketplace in which plaintiff competes.  Cf.  Becker v. Safelite Glass Co., 244 F. Supp. 625, 
637 (D. Kan. 1965). While it is true that it is the dangerous probability of success of the defendant that this court is in part trying "
1140,," to assess, the fact that defendant has market power in a different part of the country is not a particularly relevant factor if the 
defendant does not have the power to set prices or exclude competition in the market from which it desires to drive plaintiff.  The 
only relevance of defendant's market power elsewhere might be to show its ability to engage in a course of predatory pricing 
against the plaintiff: however, as previously noted, plaintiff has failed to set forth any evidence that would indicate that this is 
actually being done.  See notes 25 and 17 supra. To the extent that plaintiff charges defendant with attempting to monopolize a broader geographic market by relying on 
defendant's alleged unfair practices against other competitors in markets in which plaintiff does not compete, we do not believe 
that plaintiff has standing to make such charges.  See In re Multi-District Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L., No. 31, 481 F.2d 122 (9th 
Cir. 1973)."

1141,50," The only evidence which tends at all to indicate that Motorola has sufficient market power to exclude competition is the 
affidavit of Dean Hovey of Palomar Communications in Escondido, California.  Mr. Hovey relates Motorola's practice of 
discounting prices up to 25% of its list price, and causing his firm to lose substantial amounts of business until it too decided to 
reduce prices.  However, whatever the substance of these allegations, they are irrelevant to this action, having occurred in a 
market in which plaintiff admits to having no interest. Plaintiff's reliance on a 1972 congressional report which indicates that Motorola dominated the sale of police radio equipment 
that was purchased with LEAA funds in Arkansas and Wisconsin is similarly not relevant here.  See House Comm. on Gov't 
Operations, ""Block Grant Programs of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration,"" H.R. Rep. 92-1072, 92d Cong., 2d

1176,4," We note also the many instances where courts have fashioned private remedies from regulatory legislation prescribing only

1182,2," The sub-bidding procedure may at times be plagued by other unethical practices such as ""bid shopping,"" in which generals 
submit their own bids and thereafter ""shop"" for a mechanical or other subcontractor who will meet a given price, and ""bid piracy"" 
in which a subcontractor will use the valuable information contained in a competitor's already-filed bid as a starting point for the 
preparation of his own bid. The discussion of unethical practices in the mechanical contracting industry in this action, however, 
has focused almost entirely upon bid peddling."

and § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 14. In his brief in this Court, petitioner has also argued that the program constitutes 
unlawful tying violative of § 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaint seeks treble damages and an injunction permanently enjoining 
respondent from requiring the purchase of bulbs in connection with the sale of electrical energy.  The complaint purports to be 
filed on behalf of all persons similarly situated, but the record contains no indication that the plaintiff moved for a class 
determination pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 (c)."

Stone's opinion discussing the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the Commerce Clause, see 317 U.S., at 357, 358-359, 368, but

May the California raisin program be enjoined in the present action?....................64"""
1201,19," At p. 59 of its brief, the Government stated: ""The Sherman Act does not in terms define its scope in so far as it applies to the activities of state governments.  But nothing in 
the Act precludes its application to programs sponsored by the states.  Sections 1 and 2 prohibit unlawful conduct by 'persons,' 
and the word 'person,' as defined in Section 7, in some connections at least, may include a state.  Georgia v. Evans, 316 U.S. 
159. ""But the question we face here is not whether California or its officials have violated the Sherman Act, but whether the state 
program interferes with the accomplishment of the objectives of the federal statute."""
1201,20," At p. 63 of its brief, the Government stated: ""A state statute permitting, or requiring, dealers in a commodity to combine so as to limit the supply or raise the price of a subject 
of interstate commerce would clearly be void.  The question here is whether a state may itself undertake to control the supply 
and price of a commodity shipped in interstate commerce or otherwise restrain interstate competition through a mandatory 
regulation."""
1201,21," ""But it is plain that the prorate program here was never intended to operate by force of individual agreement or combination.  It 
derived its authority and its efficacy from the legislative command of the state and was not intended to operate or become 
effective without that command.  We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its 
purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.  In a dual system of government 
in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their 
authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to 
Congress. ""The Sherman Act makes no mention of the state as such, and gives no hint that it was intended to restrain state action or 
official action directed by a state. "
1202,," .  .  . ""There is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history. The sponsor of the bill which was 
ultimately enacted as the Sherman Act declared that it prevented only 'business combinations.' 21 Cong. Rec. 2562, 2457; see 
also [id.] at 2459, 2461.  That its purpose was to suppress combinations to restrain competition and attempts to monopolize by 
individuals and corporations, abundantly appears from its legislative history. ..  . ""The state in adopting and enforcing the prorate program made no contract or agreement and entered into no conspiracy in 
restraint of trade or to establish monopoly but, as sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government which the Sherman 
Act did not undertake to prohibit.  Olsen v. Smith, 195 U.S. 332, 344-[3]45; cf.  Lowenstein v. Evans, 69 F. 908, 910."" 317 U.S., 
at 350-352."
1202,22," See n. 15, supra."
1202,23," See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 172-187; Adickes v. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 188-234 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in 
part and dissenting in part)."
1202,24," In his three-page discussion of the Sherman Act issue in Parker v. Brown, Mr. Chief Justice Stone made 13 references to the 
fact that state action was involved.  Each time his language was carefully chosen to apply only to official action, as opposed to 
private action approved, supported, or even directed by the State.  Thus, his references were to (1) ""the legislative command of 
the state,"" and (2) ""a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature,"" 317 U.S., at 350; and to (3) ""a 
state's control over its officers and agents,"" (4) ""the state as such,"" (5) ""state action or official action directed by a state,"" and (6) 
""state action,"" id., at 351; and to (7) ""the state command to the Commission and to the program committee,"" (8) ""state action,"" 
(9) ""the state which has created the machinery for establishing the prorate progam,"" (10) ""it is the state, acting through the 
Commission, which adopts the program…,"" (11) ""[t]he state itself exercises its legislative authority,"" (12) ""[t]he state in adopting 
and enforcing the prorate program…,"" and finally (13) ""as sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government…,"" id., at 
352. The cumulative effect of these carefully drafted references unequivocally differentiates between official action, on the one hand, 
and individual action (even when commanded by the State), on the other hand. "
1203,25," Indeed, in Parker v. Brown itself, there was significant private participation in the formulation and effectuation of the proration 
program.  As the Court pointed out, approval of the program upon referendum by a prescribed number of producers was one of 
the conditions for effectuating the program.  See ibid."
1203,26," ""It cannot be said that any State may give a corporation, created under its laws, authority to restrain interestate or international 
commerce against the will of the nation as lawfully expressed by Congress."" Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 
197, 346."
1203,27," In the Parker opinion itself, the Court pointed out that HN3[
] a State does not give immunity to those who violate the 
Sherman Act ""by declaring that their action is lawful."" 317 U.S., at 351."
1203,28," ""Respondents' arguments, at most, constitute the contention that their activities complemented the objective of the ethical 
codes.  In our view that is not state action for Sherman Act purposes.  It is not enough that, as the County Bar puts it, 
anticompetitive conduct is 'prompted' by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the 
State acting as a sovereign,"" Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 791."
1203,29," See Continental Co. v. Union Carbide, 370 U.S. 690; cf. also Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450, cited in 
Parker v. Brown, supra, at 352."
1203,30," Thus, although the private decision to enforce a statewide fair trade program was not only approved by the State, but actually 
would have been ineffective without the statutory command to nonsigners to adhere to the prices set by the plaintiff, the rationale 
of Parker v. Brown did not immunize the restraint.  Quite the contrary, in his opinion for the Court Mr. Justice Douglas cited 
Parker for the proposition that private conduct was forbidden by the Sherman Act even though the State had compelled retailers 
to follow a parallel price policy.  He said: ""Therefore, when a state compels retailers to follow a parallel price policy, it demands 
private conduct which the Sherman Act forbids.  See Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350."" 341 U.S., at 389."
1203,31," We recently described an analogous exercise of a public utility's power to make business decisions subject to Commission 
approval in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345: HN4[
] ""The nature of governmental regulation of private utilities is such that a utility may frequently be required by the state 
regulatory scheme to obtain approval for practices a business regulated in less detail would be free to institute without any "
1204,," approval from a regulatory body.  Approval by a state utility commission of such a request from a regulated utility, where the 
Commission has not put its own weight on the side of the proposed practice by ordering it, does not transmute a practice 
initiated by the utility and approved by the Commission into 'state action.' At most, the Commission's failure to overturn this 
practice amounted to no more than a determination that a Pennsylvania utility was authorized to employ such a practice if it so 
desired.  Respondent's exercise of the choice allowed by state law where the initiative comes from it and not from the State, 
does not make its action in doing so 'state action' for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Id., at 357. (Footnote omitted.)"
1204,32," Nor is such a conclusion even arguably inconsistent with the underlying rationale of Parker v. Brown. For in that case 
California required every raisin producer in the State to comply with the proration program, whereas Michigan has never required 
any utility to adopt a lamp-exchange program."
1204,33," As MR. JUSTICE STEWART pointed out in his dissenting opinion in Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 389, 
the ""very reason for the regulation of private utility rates -- by state bodies and by the Commission -- is the inevitability of a 
monopoly that requires price control to take the place of price competition."""
1204,34," Commenting on a possible conflict between federal regulatory policy and federal antitrust policy we have repeatedly said 
""'[r]epeal [of the antitrust laws] is to be regarded as implied only if necessary to make the… [Act] work, and even then only to the 
minimum extent necessary.'"" Id., at 391, quoting Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357."
1204,35," Indeed, since our decision in Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, supra, there can be no doubt about the proposition that 
HN5[
] the federal antitrust laws are applicable to electrical utilities.  Although there was dissent from the particular application 
of the statute in that case, there was no dissent from the basic proposition that such utilities must obey the federal antitrust laws. "
1205,36," Respondent does not argue that state regulation provides a stronger justification for an implied exemption than federal 
regulation. On the contrary, respondent relies heavily on Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, 422 U.S. 659, in which the Court 
upheld the fixed commissions of the stock exchange as an integral part of the effective operation of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934.  The inapplicability of that case is manifest from MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S brief concurring opinion in which he stated: ""The Court has never held, and does not hold today, that the antitrust laws are inapplicable to anticompetitive conduct simply 
because a federal agency has jurisdiction over the activities of one or more of the defendants.  HN6[
] An implied repeal of the 
antitrust laws may be found only if there exists a 'plain repugnancy between the antitrust and regulatory provisions.' United 
States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 351. ""The mere existence of the Commission's reserve power of oversight with respect to rules initially adopted by the exchanges, 
therefore, does not necessarily immunize those rules from antitrust attack….  The question presented by the present case, 
therefore, is whether exchange rules fixing minimum commission rates are 'necessary to make the Securities Exchange Act 
work.'"" Id., at 692-693. The lamp-supply program is by no means comparably imperative in the continued effective functioning of Michigan's regulation 
of the utilities industry."
1205,37," See n. 34, supra. Recent cases make it clear that the relevant ""'aspect of the agency's jurisdiction must be sufficiently central 
to the purposes of the enabling statute so that implied repeal of the antitrust laws is 'necessary to make the [regulatory scheme]

National Assn. of Securities Dealers, 422 U.S. 694, 719-720, the Court pointed out: ""Implied antitrust immunity is not favored, and can be justified only by a convincing showing of clear repugnancy between the 
antitrust laws and the regulatory system.  See, e.g., United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S., at 348; United States v. 
Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 197-206 (1939)."" These cases are, of course, consistent with the ""cardinal rule,"" applicable to legislation generally, that repeals by implication are 
not favored.  Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503. "
1206,38," Of course, the absence of an exemption from the antitrust laws does not mean that those laws have been violated."
1206,39," It is this concern which has repeatedly prompted the introduction of bills which, if adopted, would make the award of treble 
damages in antitrust litigation discretionary rather than mandatory.  See Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to 
Study the Antitrust Laws 378-380 (1955).  See also, e.g., H.R. 978, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957); H.R. 190, 87th Cong., 1st

1206,40," ""As a charter of freedom, the Act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional 
provisions.  It does not go into detailed definitions which might either work injury to legitimate enterprise or through 
particularization defeat its purposes by providing loopholes for escape.  The restrictions the Act imposes are not mechanical or 
artificial.  Its general phrases, interpreted to attain its fundamental objects, set up the essential standard of reasonableness.  
They call for vigilance in the detection and frustration of all efforts unduly to restrain the free course of interstate commerce, but 
they do not seek to establish a mere delusive liberty either by making impossible the normal and fair expansion of that 
commerce or the adoption of reasonable measures to protect it from injurious and destructive practices and to promote 
competition upon a sound basis."" Appalachian Coals, Inc.  v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 359-360. "

1207,42," Indeed, it did not even occur to the plaintiff that the state officials might have violated the Sherman Act; that question was first

1207,44," ""We accept, as the starting point for our consideration of the case, the same basic construction of the Sherman Act adopted by 
the courts below -- that no violation of the Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of 
laws.  It has been recognized, at least since the landmark decision of this Court in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, [221 U.S. 
1,] that the Sherman Act forbids only those trade restraints and monopolizations that are created, or attempted, by the acts of 
'individuals or combinations of individuals or corporations.' Accordingly, it has been held that where a restraint upon trade or 
monopolization is the result of valid governmental action, as opposed to private action, no violation of the Act can be made out."" 
(Rock Royal and Parker are then cited in the footnote which is omitted.) 365 U.S., at 135-136."
1207,45," MR. JUSTICE STEWART's analysis rests largely on the dubious assumption that if each of several steps in the 
implementation of an anticompetitive program is lawful, the entire program must be equally lawful. "
1209,1," The Court expressly stated in Schwegmann: ""The fact that a state authorizes the price fixing does not, of course, give immunity 
to the scheme, absent approval by Congress."" And again: ""[W]hen a state compels retailers to follow a parallel price policy, it 
demands private conduct which the Sherman Act forbids."" 341 U.S., at 386, 389."
1209,2," The argument that New Jersey law exempted Northern Securities Company from the Sherman Act was thoroughly canvassed 
in the plurality opinion.  193 U.S., at 344-351. It was rejected for the reason ""that no State can endow any of its corporations, or 
any combination of its citizens, with authority to restrain interstate or international commerce, or to disobey the national will as 
manifested in legal enactments of Congress."" Id., at 350."
1209,3," In passing, we may cast at least a sidelong glance at a related area of federal trade regulation -- that of the patent laws.  
Although the federal statute is no more explicit on the point than is the Sherman Act, see 35 U.S.C.  § 100 et seq., it clearly pre-
empts state laws that purport either to expand on or to infringe the federal patent monopoly. See, e.g., Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 "
1210,," U.S. 653 (1969); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, 376 U.S. 234 
(1964)."
1210,4," The McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed in reaction to the holding in United States v. Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533 
(1944), that the business of insurance is ""commerce"" within the meaning of the Sherman Act.Congress' expressed concern was 
that the application of that Act would ""greatly impair or nullify the regulation of insurance by the States,"" bringing to a halt their 
""experimentation and investigation"" in the area.  The Act was vigorously endorsed by Governors and insurance commissioners 
of ""almost all of the States."" The Justice Department, in opposing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, specifically argued that Parker v. 
Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943), made the legislation unnecessary because it immunized the insurance business insofar as it was 
regulated by the States.  Congress was not so sure: ""Parker v. Brown dealt with a State commission authorized by State statute to enforce a program in conformity with, if not 
supplementary to, a Federal statute.  Obviously, all State regulation concerning insurance does not and would not fall in such a 
category."" S. Rep. No. 1112, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1944).  See also S. Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-3 (1945); H.R. 
Rep. No. 873, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1943); H.R. Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1945). "
1212,5," The approach described in the text is entirely consistent with the result reached in Parker v. Brown. Wildly fluctuating 
agricultural prices are a prime candidate for some collective scheme that interrupts free competition in order to bring badly 
needed stability; under the State's close supervision, as was the case in Parker, the scheme seems entirely reasonable.  I see 
no reason to disapprove the holding of Parker, therefore, and to the extent that the plurality, by stressing the identity of the state 
defendants in that case, intimates that a different result might have been reached had the raisin growers themselves been sued, 
I cannot agree. Neither can I agree with the dissent, however, that Parker must be taken to stand for the broad proposition that a State can 
immunize any conduct from the application of the Sherman Act. It is true, as the dissent points out, that there are statements 
arguably to that effect in Parker, but the opinion is hardly unambiguous on the point.  The Court also observed in that case that 
""a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their 
action is lawful."" 317 U.S., at 351. Moreover, if we must choose between Parker's more categorical statements and the 
seemingly contrary statements in Schwegmann and Northern Securities, see nn. 1 and 2, supra, I prefer the latter, as more in 
keeping with the actual holdings of those cases."
1212,6," MR. JUSTICE STEVENS states that there may be cases in which ""the State's participation in a decision [to adopt the 
challenged restraint] is so dominant that it is unfair to hold a private party responsible for his conduct in implementing it."" Ante, at 
594-595.  I agree that a defense based on fairness may be available.  I would not, however, rule it out in this case, as the 
Court'sopinion does.  The parties, like the court below, so far have addressed themselves only to the question whether 
petitioner's suit is completely barred by Parker v. Brown and the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the 
challenged tie-in.  I would confine our present decision to that question alone, leaving consideration of a fairness defense to the 
lower courts on remand, and making only these two further observations: First, I take it that a defense based on fairness would be a defense to a damages recovery but not injunctive relief.  The latter, of 
course, presents no danger of unfairness.  Moreover, as MR. JUSTICE STEVENS implies by his emphasis on not unfairly 
holding a private party ""responsible,"" the defense rests on the theory, not that the challenged restraint is legal, but that since the 
defendant has committed no voluntary act in implementing it, he cannot be said to have violated any law.  The same would not 
be true of acts following a judgment that the restraint is in fact illegal, and the state law to that extent invalid. Second, I would hope that consideration will be given on remand to allowing a defense against damages wherever the conduct 
on which such damages would be based was required by state law. Such a rule would comport with the theory that a defendant 
should not be held ""responsible"" in damages for conduct as to which he had no choice, by which I do not mean to rule out other 
possible grounds for such a rule.  See Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust 
Laws, 49 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 693, 728-732 (1974). It would also eliminate what seems to me the extremely unfair possibility that 
during a particular period -- and it could be a regulatory lag during which the regulatee was attempting to change the state 
mandate -- the regulatee could be required by state law to conform to a course of conduct for which he was all the while 
accumulating treble-damages liability under federal law. "

1213,2," Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 788."
1213,3," The progenitor of that doctrine in this Court was Olsen v. Smith, 195 U.S. 332, a decision relied on by Parker to support the 
proposition that when a State, acting as sovereign, imposes a restraint on commerce, that restraint does not violate the Sherman 
Act. Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S., at 352. Olsen involved a challenge to the validity of a Texas law fixing the charges of pilots 
operating in the port of Galveston and prohibiting all but duly commissioned pilots from engaging in the pilotage business.  The 
Court rejected the argument that the Texas pilotage statutes were ""repugnant… to the laws of Congress forbidding combinations 
in restraint of trade or commerce,"" 195 U.S., at 339: ""The contention that because the commissioned pilots have a monopoly of the business, and by combination among themselves 
exclude all others from rendering pilotage services, is also but a denial of the authority of the State to regulate, since if the State 
has the power to regulate, and in so doing to appoint and commission, those who are to perform pilotage services, it must follow 
that no monopoly or combination in a legal sense can arise from the fact that the duly authorized agents of the State are alone 
allowed to perform the duties devolving upon them by law.  When the propositions just referred to are considered in their 
ultimate aspect they amount simply to the contention, not that the Texas laws are void for want of power, but that they are 
unwise.  If an analysis of those laws justified such conclusion -- which we do not at all imply is the case -- the remedy is in 
Congress, in whom the ultimate authority on the subject is vested, and cannot be judicially afforded by denying the power of the 
State to exercise its authority over a subject concerning which it has plenary power until Congress has seen fit to act in the 
premises."" Id., at 344-345."
1213,4," If Parker v. Brown, supra, could be circumvented by the simple expedient of suing the private party against whom the State's 
""anticompetitive"" command runs, then that holding would become an empty formalism, standing for little more than the 
proposition that Porter Brown sued the wrong parties. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN in a separate opinion today states that he sees ""no reason to disapprove the holding of Parker"" ante, 
at 613 n. 5, but then proceeds to do precisely that.  The holding in Parker was that ""[t]he state in adopting and enforcing the "
1214,," prorate program… imposed [a] restraint as an act of government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit."" 317 U.S., 
at 352. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN's position is that the Sherman Act does prohibit all state-imposed restraints which do not 
satisfy the Sherman Act's ""rule of reason"" -- a view quite different from the holding in Parker.  The fact that the result in Parker 
could have been reached by a different route -- by a holding, for instance, that the prorate restraint was ""reasonable"" within the 
meaning of the Sherman Act or was impliedly exempted by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 -- is simply 
irrelevant. I am puzzled by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN's willingness to emasculate Parker, which the Court indicated to have continued 
vitality just this Term.  See Virginia Pharmacy Bd.  v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 770. It seems to me that such a 
step is inconsistent not only with the legislative history of the Sherman Act but also with well-settled principles of stare decisis 
applicable to this Court's construction of federal statutes.  See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671 n. 14. If those principles 
preclude the reconsideration of an antitrust exemption which is in every sense an ""aberration"" and an ""anomaly,"" Flood v. Kuhn, 
407 U.S. 258, 282, then a fortiori they preclude the re-examination of an exemption that coincides with a clear expression of 
congressional intent."
1214,5," A different approach is, of course, called for in interpreting this Court's summary dispositions of appeals.  See generally Hicks 
v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 345 n. 14; Port Authority Bondholders Protective Comm.  v. Port of New York Authority, 387 
F.2d 259, 262 (CA2)."
1214,6," California's argument began with a statement of the principle that the Federal Government and the States -- ""sister 
sovereignties,"" Supplemental Brief for Appellants 35 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942, No. 46 -- are each ""supreme"" when 
legislating ""within their respective spheres."" ""The subject of Federal power is still 'commerce,' -- not all commerce, but commerce 
with foreign nations and among the several states."" Id., at 35-37.  Incorporating by explicit reference its preceding argument with 
respect to whether the Federal Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 pre-empted the California statute, id., at 38, and proceeding 
from the premise that the subject matter of the California law was intrastate commerce within the jurisdiction of the State, 
California contended that ""it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the police 
powers of the States unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested."" Ibid.  California added that ""[s]uch an intent 
should be even more clear and express when it serves not only to suspend the police powers, but to subject the sovereignty of 
the State to the inhibition and penalties of Congressional action."" Id., at 38-39. The plurality's position today seems to be that because the State of California placed particular emphasis on the fact that the 
proscriptions of the Sherman Act, if applicable, would run directly against the State, California's argument in the first part of its "
1215,," brief was simply and solely that ""Congress never intended to subject a sovereign State to the provisions of the Sherman Act…."" 
Ante, at 588.  Yet, as the preceding quotations show, California's argument in the first part of its brief dovetailed two interrelated 
themes: First, that state regulation of intrastate commerce was not pre-empted by the Sherman Act and, second, that the 
framers of the Sherman Act did not intend its proscriptions to run directly against the sovereign States.  It was the first of these 
themes that California deemed primary.  Near the close of the first part of California's brief appeared the following passage: ""To hold the State within the prohibition of the Sherman Act in the present instance would result in prohibiting it from exercising 
its otherwise valid police powers.  This Court has repeatedly and emphatically stated that 'it should never be held that Congress 
intends to supersede or by its legislation suspend the exercise of the police powers of the State, even when it may do so, unless 
its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested.'"" Supplemental Brief for Appellants 47-48 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942, 
No. 46 (footnote omitted)."
1215,7," This distinction was properly drawn, as is apparent from decisions in the labor law context.  A State or political subdivision 
thereof is not normally subject to the prohibitions of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U.S.C.  § 
151 et seq.  See, e.g., NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility Dist., 402 U.S. 600. But it certainly does not follow that sovereign enactments 
of the State may not be deemed pre-empted by the federal legislation.  San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236; Garner v. 
Teamsters, 346 U.S. 485."
1215,8," The Solictor General began his analysis with the following statement: ""A state statute permitting, or requiring, dealers in a commodity to combine so as to limit the supply or raise the price of a subject 
of interstate commerce would clearly be void.  The question here is whether a state may itself undertake to control the supply 
and price of a commodity shipped in interstate commerce or otherwise restrain interstate competition through a mandatory 
regulation."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 63 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942, No. 46. He then acknowledged that ""[i]t seems clear that Congress, when it enacted the statute, did not intend to deprive the states of 
their normal 'police' powers over business and industry….  For example, in the field of public utilities, a state can undoubtedly 
regulate rates without running afoul of the Sherman Act notwithstanding the fact that the rate regulation may embrace interstate 
commerce."" Id., at 63-64 (footnotes and citations omitted).  But, the Solicitor General continued, ""[a]lthough Congress plainly did 
not regard local laws in these fields as incompatible with the Sherman Act, we believe that the same cannot be said when the 
state statute is designed directly to control the competitive aspects of an industry in a manner which will have more than local 
effect."" Id., at 64-65.  This was the critical portion of the Solicitor General's argument, which sought to draw a delicate distinction 
between acceptable police power legislation, such as public utility regulation, and pre-empted police power legislation, such as 
that designed explicitly to suppress competition affecting interstate commerce. "
1216,9," The only exception is where the attempt to influence state regulation is a ""sham"" aimed at ""harass[ing] and deterr[ing]… 
competitors from having 'free and unlimited access' to the agencies and courts…."" California Motor Transport Co.  v. Trucking 
Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 515. "
1217,10," The Court's reliance on Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, is misplaced.  There the Court held that a utility's 
discontinuance of service to a customer for nonpayment of bills was not ""state action"" sufficient to trigger the protections of the 
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The petitioner had argued that because the State Public Utility Commission 
had approved that practice as a part of the respondent's general tariff, the termination was ""state action"" for Fourteenth 
Amendment purposes.  Id., at 354. The Court disagreed, holding as follows: ""The nature of governmental regulation of private 
utilities is such that a utility may frequently be required by the state regulatory scheme to obtain approval for practices a 
business regulated in less detail would be free to institute without any approval from a regulatory body.  Approval by a state 
utility commission of such a request from a regulated utility, where the Commission has not put its own weight on the side of the 
proposed practice by ordering it, does not transmute a practice initiated by the utility and approved by the Commission into 'state 
action.' At most, the Commission's failure to overturn this practice amounted to no more than a determination that a 
Pennsylvania utility was authorized to employ such a practice if it so desired.  Respondent's exercise of the choice allowed by 
state law where the initiative comes from it and not from the State, does not make its action in doing so 'state action' for 
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Id., at 357 (footnote omitted). This constitutional holding has no bearing on whether a utility's action in compliance with a tariff which it proposed is exempt 
from Sherman Act liability.  The latter is a question of legislative intent, not constitutional law, and must be answered on the 
basis of a separate line of authority -- namely, decisions such as Parker and Noerr which have construed the Sherman Act."
1217,11," I disagree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE's conclusion that Michigan's policy is ""neutral"" with respect to whether a utility should 
have a lamp-exchange program.  See n. 26, infra. Moreover, I think it is apparent that insistence on statutory articulation of a 
state ""purpose"" to regulate activities performed incident to the provision of a ""natural monopoly"" service will lead to serious 
interference with state regulation. See ibid."
1217,12," As the Court noted in Noerr, the scheme at issue in Parker required popular initiative.  365 U.S., at 137-138, n. 17. And as it 
further noted, Parker itself expressly rejected the argument that the necessity for private initiative affected the ""program's validity 
under the Sherman Act…."" Id., at 137. "
1218,13," The Court seems to indicate at one point that it would be improper to ""superimpose"" antitrust liability on state regulatory 
schemes aimed at suppressing competition and raising prices.  See ante, at 595 (""Unquestionably there are examples of 
economic regulation in which the very purpose of the government control is to avoid the consequences of unrestrained 
competition.  Agricultural marketing programs, such as that involved in Parker, were of that character"").  But some state 
regulation, the Court continues, aims not at suppressing competition, but rather at duplicating the effects of competition -- i.e., 
keeping prices down.  With respect to state regulation of the latter type, the state scheme will not afford an exemption to the 
extent the regulated party is engaged in ""business activity in competitive areas of the economy."" Ante, at 596 (footnote omitted). This rationale will not bear its own weight.  If compliance with a state program aimed at suppressing competition in nonmonopoly 
industries -- i.e., raisin production -- cannot give rise to Sherman Act liability, then surely compliance with a state program aimed 
at controlling the terms and conditions of service performed incident to the provision of a ""natural monopoly"" product cannot give 
rise to treble damages. "

1222,25," MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN expresses the view that the Court answered the question of ""what was to be the result if the 
expanding ambit of the Sherman Act should bring it into conflict with inconsistent state law"" in Schwegmann Bros.  v. Calvert 
Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, and that the answer it gave was that any state regulatory statute ""inconsistent"" with the judicially 
expanded Sherman Act was pre-empted. Ante, at 606.  But the opinion in Schwegmann -- which did not purport to modify or 
overrule Parker -- is most plausibly read as resting on a post-1890 expression of congressional intent, the Miller-Tydings Act.  
See infra, at 639.  Even assuming, however, that Schwegmann conflicted with Parker, then surely the most significant aspect of 
that conflict is that Congress did not allow it to persist, as Schwegmann was soon legislatively overruled by the enactment of the 
McGuire bill, 66 Stat. 632, 15 U.S.C.§§ 45(a)(2)(5)."
1222,26," The Court states at one point that the omission of a ""direct reference to light bulbs"" in the statute creating the Michigan Public 
Service Commission indicates that the State's policy is ""neutral on the question whether a utility should, or should not, have such 
a program."" Ante, at 584, 585.  This statement seems to suggest that the Court considers the specificity with which a state 
legislature deals with particular regulatory matters to be relevant in determining whether agency action respecting such matters 
represents a sovereign choice, entitled to deference under the Sherman Act. This suggestion overlooks the fact that Michigan's policy, far from being ""neutral,"" is, as announced in Mich. Comp. Laws § 
460.6 (1970), to vest an expert agency ""with complete power and jurisdiction to regulate all public utilities in the state…."" That 
agency is ""vested with power and jurisdiction to regulate all rates, fares, fees, charges, services, rules, conditions of service and 
all other matters pertaining to the formation, operation or direction of such public utilities.  It is further granted the power and 
jurisdiction to hear and pass upon all matters pertaining to or necessary or incident to such regulation of all public utilities, 
including electric light and power companies…."" Ibid.  (emphasis added). If a state legislature can ensure antitrust exemption only by eschewing such broad delegation of regulatory authority and 
incorporating regulatory details into statutory law, then there is a very great risk that the State will be prevented from regulating 
effectively.  For as this Court has repeatedly observed in another context, ""[d]elegation… has long been recognized as 
necessary in order that the exertion of legislative power does not become a futility….  [T]he effectiveness of both the legislative 
and administrative processes would become endangered if [the legislature] were under the… compulsion of filling in the details 
beyond the liberal prescription [of requiring the making of 'just and reasonable' rates and regulating in the 'public interest'] here.  
Then the burdens of minutiae would be apt to clog the administration of the law and deprive the agency of that flexibility and 
dispatch which are its salient virtues."" Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co.  v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 398. "

1236,17," The government suggests that an interpretation such as that we reach would be incongruous, permitting only a $5,000 penalty 
for a full-blown anti-trust violation, but a $10,000 penalty for a violation of the broader FTCA § 5.  The short answer, of course, is 
that this result is not incongruous if, as we have found, Congress so intended.  Nor is such an intent unreasonable.  For 
instance, Congress might determine that there should be a $10,000 penalty for violating cease and desist orders which, by and 
large, are capable of prompt compliance; on the other hand, Congress might determine that the $5,000 figure should obtain for 
violations of divestiture orders under the Clayton Act, because divestiture cannot be accomplished overnight.  Lastly, the 
government's argument itself leads to an incongruity, for it would permit the FTC to collect $10,000 for each violation of an order 
stemming from Clayton Act § 11, but relegate the ICC, the FCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the CAB, which agencies 
proceeded under the same statute, to penalties of $5,000 for each violation. "

that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States which it would not otherwise have.  
The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from 
the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for his failure 
to obtain the action or for not making the effort.  The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff 
does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the

1254,25," If this lawsuit were realigned as a derivative action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1, Sunshine Pontiac, although the real party

1254,27," It is evident that in processing Judice's application for a dealership, General Motors treated Judice, not Sunshine Pontiac, as 
the individual applicant.  This is understandable since the independent dealer is of paramount and critical importance to the 
success of Motors Holding Dealer Investment Plan.  The Plan states (Harvey Affidavit, Exhibit A, Investment Plan at 2): "
1255,," ""General Motors need outlets for the sale and service of its various consumer products in all markets where those products 
are salable.  In the case of its automotive products, that means practically everywhere.  Its policy is to distribute such 
products through independent merchants, who operate with their own capital and for their own profit.  Character, capacity, 
the willingness to work and ambition to progress, as well as the requisite capital, have long been recognized as essential 
ingredients in the success of any business.  The entire history of enterprise demonstrates the futility of expecting success 
where any of these prime essentials is lacking to an important degree. "" Here an obvious distinction exists between the independent dealer deemed so essential to the sale and distribution of General 
Motors' automobiles and the corporate dealership which is substantially owned and entirely controlled by General Motors and 
exists to protect the investment of General Motors.  The Dealer Investment Plan calls for Judice to own a steadily increasing 
percentage and eventually all of the voting stock of Sunshine Pontiac, see note 12, supra, and to have full authority for the 
operation and management of the dealership. Finally, and perhaps most revealing, the dealership was formed in the name of 
Judice's Sunshine Pontiac, Inc."

costs by eliminating duplicated ground facilities to be in the public interest. Defendants' Memorandum, Exh. 4, at 2-3.  The 
opinion accompanying Order E-1930 suggests that the Board carefully considered the effect of the proposed agreement upon 
competition within the airline industry, and found the anticompetitive impact outweighed by the resulting reduction in costs to the 
public.  The order does not indicate if the Board considered whether the agreement would have an anticompetitive impact upon 
other industries, as, for example, the local carrier industry.  In a later order, however, the Board has manifested a concern with 
preserving healthy competition between ACI and local independent carriers. See Local Cartage Agreement Case, 15 CAB 850,

rejected the argument that this licensing method was the only practicable way to exploit the patent, holding that the plaintiff's 
attempt to establish a monopoly in an unpatented article constituted mis-use of its patent. The Chief Justice indicated that if the 
plaintiff was willing to grant unconditional licenses to manufacturers on a royalty basis, reconsideration of its right to relief would 
be appropriate. "

1322,7," Plaintiff, in arguing that § 271(d) expressly sanctions its licensing policies, maintains that ""[in] the event that at some future time 
a substantial commercial use for propanil should arise in this country which does not infringe the patent at bar, Rohm and Haas 
then would modify its licensing policy since the Section 271(d) exception would no longer apply"".  In its complaint plaintiff 
charges defendants with actively inducing infringement, under § 271(b), as well as contributory infringement, under § 271(c).  
Throughout its memorandum filed in opposition to defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiff urges that its own 
conduct vis-a-vis patent misuse under § 271(d) should be sanctioned or condemned depending solely upon whether propanil is 
determined to be a staple or non-staple article.  Nowhere in the language of § 271(d) has Congress limited or otherwise defined 
patent misuse by reference to the staple or nonstaple nature of an unpatented component.  For reasons set out in Fromberg, 
Inc. v. Thornhill, 315 F.2d 407, 414-415 note 20 (5th Cir. 1967), and Section III.B.2., infra, this Court has concluded that the 
nature of a component article of a patented combination is germane only to the definition of a contributory infringer under § 
271(c); it should not confuse analysis of the patentee's conduct under § 271(d) for purposes of determining patent misuse vel 
non. "

a member of the patent subcommittee of the House, is purported to have stated that: ""… this colloquy is almost entirely meaningless, it being merely an exchange of pleasantries by some senators having little, if 
any familiarity with the subject matter they were discussing.  21/ [21)….  Any senator or representative who got as far as reading the title of the bill would see it was a bill to revise and codify the 
laws.]"" J. Scafetta, note 8, supra at 558.  While the Court agrees that little weight should be accorded to this colloquy between senators 
on the floor, great weight must be accorded to the presumption that, in citing this exchange on at least two occasions, the 
Supreme Court has concluded that the result in Mercoid has not been overruled. The Court has closely studied the Scafetta article, note 8, supra, for two reasons.  First, it is the most recent as well as the most 
comprehensive commentary published on the doctrine of patent misuse. Second, it has been graced by the Robert C. Watson 
Award for 1975 from the American Patent Law Association for the best publication prepared by an author, while a student, on a 
""subject of primary importance to the patent system"".  See 58 J. PAT. OFF. SOC'Y, 69 (1976). The collision in this case of the 
policies underpinning the patent laws and the antitrust laws is graphically illuminated by Scafetta's assault on the views of the 
Justice Department and the American Bar Association Section on Antitrust Law, which coincide with this Court's finding of 
patent misuse. Scafetta, supra at 589.  See ABA ANTITRUST SECTION 339-41 (1975). Based primarily on his interpretation of the Supreme Court's opinion in Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 
U.S. 476 (1964), Mr. Scafetta concluded in his article that the enactment of § 271 effectively overruled the result as well as the 
broad dictum in the Mercoid decisions.  For reasons set out in Section III.C., infra, this Court disagrees.  Moreover, the 
exploitation pursued in the present case transcends the conduct which confronted the Supreme Court in Mercoid.  Section III.A.,

request from PMA, each such participant shall furnish to PMA a list of men it is using on a steady basis.  Steady men shall 
participate in the Pay Guarantee Plan in accordance with the rules that are adopted by PMA and ILWU. Revised Agreement P 5, J.A. at 453.  See also S.M.4 P 3a, J.A. at 425."
1359,9, 
1359,3," .  A nonmember participant will share in the use of the joint work force upon the same terms as apply to members of PMA.  
For example: (a) the nonmember participant shall obtain men on the same basis as a PMA member from the dispatch hall operated by 
ILWU and PMA through the allocation system operated by PMA, (b) if a work stoppage by ILWU shuts off the dispatch of men from the dispatch hall to PMA members, nonmember 
participants shall not obtain men from the dispatch hall, (c) if during a work stoppage by ILWU, PMA and ILWU agree on limited dispatch of men from the dispatch hall for PMA 
members, such limited dispatch shall be available to nonmember participants. The essence of (b) and (c) of this section is the acceptance by nonmember participants of the principle that a work 
stoppage by ILWU against PMA members is a work stoppage against nonmember participants. Revised Agreement P 3, J.A. at 452.  See also S.M.4 P 8-10, J.A. at 426-27. The Revised Agreement also required uniform terms regarding selection of men in the joint work force, continuance of obligation 
to pay PMA assessments, and use of uniform payment and record forms."

1360,11," The pending antitrust cases to which Hearing Counsel refers were discussed at length in his first Memorandum, J.A. at 57-61.  
In the first case, Port of Anacortes v. PMA and ILWU, Civil No. 72-618 (D. Ore., filed Aug. 2, 1972), eight ports challenge 
Supplemental Memorandum No. 4 under the antitrust laws. The second case, brought by the Port of Longview, makes basically 
the same allegations of antitrust conspiracy violations.  Port of Longview v. PMA and ILWU, Civil No. 72-626 (D. Ore., filed Aug. 
3, 1972).  The third case added to the general antitrust claims a challenge to the collective bargaining agreement provision 
concerning containerized shipments.  Port of Seattle v. PMA, Civil No. 214-72C2 (W.D. Wash., filed Apr. 4, 1972).  All three 
cases were stayed pending Commission determination of the status of the agreements under the Shipping Act. "
1361,12," These agreements and conferences engaged in price fixing, discriminatory rates, limiting sailings by certain lines or from 
certain ports, freight volume restrictions, tariff pooling, and assessing fines for assistance to non-conference lines.  In addition, 
they fought outside competition by giving tariff rebates or by using ""fighting ships"" subsidized by the conference to destroy a 
single competing line.  H.R. Doc. No. 805, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 281-95 (1914) (""Alexander Report"")."
1361,13,"  It is claimed that the adoption of the first course - the prohibition of cooperative arrangements between practically all the 
lines in nearly all the divisions of our foreign trade - would not only involve a wholesale disturbance of existing conditions in 
the shipping business but would deprive American exporters and importers of the advantages claimed as resulting from 
agreements and conferences if honestly and fairly conducted, such as greater regularity and frequency of service, stability 
and uniformity of rates, economy in the cost of service, better distribution of sailings, maintenance of American and 
European rates to foreign markets on a party, and equal treatment of shippers through the elimination of secret 
arrangements and underhanded methods of discrimination. H.R. Rep. No. 659, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. 28 (1916), quoting Alexander Report at 416. "

property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is 
commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain 
acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his 
fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his 
own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, 
restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization

thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, 
or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms 
or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party 
making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be

1364,19,"  HN17[
] Strikes or agreements not to work, entered into by laborers to compel employers to yield to their demands, may 
restrict to some extent the power of employers who are parties to the dispute to compete in the market with those not 
subject to such demands.  But under the doctrine applied to non-labor cases, the mere fact of such restrictions on 
competition does not in itself bring the parties to the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act. Furthermore, 
successful union activity, as for example consummation of a wage agreement with employers, may have some influence on 
price competition by eliminating that part of such competition which is based on differences in labor standards.  Since, in 
order to render a labor combination effective it must eliminate the competition from non-union made goods, an elimination 
of price competition based on differences in labor standards is the objective of any national labor organization.  But this 
effect on competition has not been considered to be the kind of curtailment of price competition prohibited by the Sherman 
Act.  Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 503-04, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1940) (citations omitted)."

] So long as a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups, the licit and the illicit 
under § 20 [of the Clayton Act] are not to be distinguished by any judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the 
rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means. United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 232, 85 L. Ed. 788, 61 S. Ct. 463 (1941). "
1365,21," The union had disclaimed any interest in representing Connell's employees.  This factual aspect of the case is highly relevant 
since the Court determined that section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act allows a subcontracting agreement ""within the 
context of a collective-bargaining relationship."" 421 U.S. at 627. Even more important is the Court's suggestion that within a 
collective bargaining setting, labor policies may weigh more heavily. There can be no argument in this case, whatever its force in other contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude might be 
entitled to an antitrust exemption if it were included in a lawful collective-bargaining agreement.  Id. at 625-26 (emphasis added)."
1365,22," Furthermore, the coercive secondary strike was not subject only to the special remedies of the National Labor Relations Act 
since the violation at issue related to section 8(e) regarding hot cargo clauses rather than 8(b)(4) limiting secondary activities.

Justice to exempt collective bargaining agreements from section 15 by means of a rule making proceeding.  Boston II, supra, 16

appeared to expand its claim of jurisdiction in New York Shipping Association and the case before us.  See Pacific Maritime

covers agreements between ""every common carrier by water, or other person subject to this chapter"" and ""another such carrier 
or other person subject to this chapter."" See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. FMC, 125 U.S. App. D.C. 282, 371 F.2d 747, 
752 (1966). Section 801 provides in relevant part: HN32[
] The term ""other person subject to this chapter"" means any person not included in the term ""common carrier by 
water,"" carrying on the business of forwarding or furnishing wharfage, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities in 
connection with a common carrier by water."
1369,46," U.S.C. § 801 (1970). The Commission assumed that both PMA and Marine Terminals Corporation were covered by the 
definition, but denied section 15 jurisdiction over the agreement.  In reversing, the Supreme Court was silent on the issue.  This 
silence may reflect an acceptance of the FMC assumption of coverage or the theory later propounded by FMC that the presence 
of a non-covered party in the agreement does not destroy jurisdiction over the agreement. See New York Shipping Ass'n., 16 
F.M.C. 381, 388-89 (1973), aff'd sub nom.  New York Shipping Ass'n. v. FMC, 495 F.2d 1215, 1220 (2d Cir. 1974). Contra

1369,32," For example, unionization among New York longshoremen was sufficient in 1874 to organize a five-week strike seeking higher 
wages. By 1914, New York locals united within the International Longshoremen's Association and, by 1916, the ILA secured a 
port-wide agreement.  Similarly on the West Coast, an agreement obtaining wage increases from all Seattle area employers was 
signed in 1915.  C. Larrowe, Shape-Up and Hiring Hall, chs. 7-9, 87-89 (1955). "
1370,33," Compare New York Shipping Ass'n. v. FMC, 495 F.2d 1215, 1220 (2d Cir. 1974) in which the union-labor agreement 
involved an assessment formula. While we agree with the Second Circuit that the contents are like those of the 
Volkswagenwerk, we cannot accept the conclusion that active negotiation of the agreement by the union is ""a distinction without 
a difference."" 495 F.2d at 1220. Unlike the Second Circuit we face not only a different type of agreement, cf. id. at n. 11, but one 
which has been stalled for several years by FMC action. We note also that, while the agreement in New York Shipping is similar in terms to one over which this court assumed 
jurisdiction, see Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc. v. FMC, 160 U.S. App. D.C. 351, 492 F.2d 617 (1974), the Transamerican
