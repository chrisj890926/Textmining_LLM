] Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, § 7, 38 Stat. 731; U. S. C. Title 15, § 18.  The relevant paragraph is as follows: ""No corporation shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of two or more 
corporations engaged in commerce where the effect of such acquisition, or the use of such stock by the voting or granting of 
proxies or otherwise, may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, or any of them, whose stock or 
other share capital is so acquired, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of 
any line of commerce."" "

was carring on a business."
463,23," The identification of ""fair competition"" with ethical principles is expressed in the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American 
Medical Association and in the Constitution of the District Medical Society. Chapter III, Article VI of the Principles of Medical Ethics reads in part as follows: ""Conditions of Medical Practice.  Section 2.  It is unprofessional for a physician to dispose of his services under conditions that 
make it impossible to render adequate service to his patient or which interfere with reasonable competition among the 
physicians of a community.  * * * ""Contract Practice.  Section 3.  * * * Contract practice per se is not unethical.  However, certain features or conditions if present 
make a contract unethical, among which are: * * * 2.  When there is underbidding to secure the contract.  3.  When the 
compensation is inadequate to assure good medical service. 4.  When there is interference with reasonable competition in a 
community."" Chapter IX, Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution reads as follows: ""It is unprofessional for a physician to dispose of his 
services under conditions that make it impossible to render adequate service to his patient or which interfere with reasonable 
competition among the physicians of a community."" "
464,," These provisions were utilized for purposes of disciplinary action against members of the District Medical Society employed by 
Group Health. Thus, the expulsion of Dr. Scandiffio, a member of the Group Health staff, from the District Medical Society 
followed a finding of the Compensation, Contract and Industrial Medicine Committee that he was guilty of violating Sections 1 
and 2, Article III, and Section 5, Article IV, all of Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Society.  That this disciplinary action 
against members of the Society was intended to affect Group Health Association is shown by the letter of December 10, 1937, 
sent by the Chairman of the Compensation, Contract and Industrial Medicine Committee of the Society to its Executive 
Committee which reads as follows: ""On November 22nd, 1937, our committee addressed a communication to you advising you 
of our investigation concerning Drs. Allan E. Lee and M. Scandiffio, and recommended that they by expelled as members of the 
Society because of their violation of Section 1, Article III, Chapter 9, and Section 5, Article IV, Chapter 9, of the Constitution of 
the Medical Society of the District of Columbia.  Our committee is today in receipt of a letter from Dr. Allan E. Lee, advising us 
that he has resigned from the staff of Group Health Association.  Inasmuch as our recommendation respecting Dr. Lee was 
based upon the fact that he had entered into a contract with Group Health Association and that contract has now been 
terminated by him, we feel that no further action should be taken with respect to Dr. Lee.We therefore, respectfully request that 
the charges and recommendations against Dr. Lee, embodied in our communication of November 22, 1937, be withdrawn and 
that appropriate action be taken by your committee thereon."" It is shown, also, by the letter of the same Chairman to Dr. Lee under date of December 21, 1937: ""In acknowledgment of your 
letter of December 10, in which you enclose a copy of your resignation as a member of the medical staff of Group Health 
Association, Inc., may I say that upon receipt of same the Compensation, Contract and Industrial Medicine committee appeared 
before the Executive Committee and requested a withdrawal of its charges against you, which request was granted.  Such action 
places your status as that of a member now in good standing."" The concern of the defendants Association and Society with the effect of Group Health on the economic status of the medical 
profession, and upon competition in financing and making available medical and hospital services, is abundantly illustrated by 
articles and statements of officers and members thereof.  An article, appearing in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association for October 2, 1937, reads in part as follows: ""Out of a total population of 486,869 in the District of Columbia, 
115,912 are civil employees of the United States government, and, of these, 2,517 are employees of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board and its affiliated agencies.  If to these persons, all of whom are eligible for membership in Group Health Association, 
their dependents are added, allowing an average of two dependents for each employee, a total of 347,736 persons is reached, 
out of a total population of 486,869 that the promoters of Group Health Association, according to their certificate of incorporation, 
seek to withdraw from the ordinary practice of medicine and to cover into a group health insurance contract practice system and 
treat through physicians hired for that purpose.  The effect of the withdrawal from private practice of even one-half that number 
of persons, all of whom are able to pay for medical services, will materially disturb medical practice in the District of Columbia 
and react against public interest.  * * * The scheme is so planned that the richer and more liberally paid employees are to obtain 
medical service at rates based on the incomes of the poorest employees.  The courts have repeatedly held that the value of 
medical services rendered to a patient may be properly appraised in relation to his wealth, just as the value of legal services are 
commonly appraised in relation to the value of the interests that the lawyer is called on to protect, whether interests involving the 
life of his client or his client's property.  Under the present scheme, fees that are charged for medical services to the richer and 
more liberally paid employees are to be identical with those charged employees of the lowest grade, doing part-time work."" The author of this article, who was one of the individual defendants, was Director of the Bureau of Legal Medicine and 
Legislation of the American Medical Association from 1922 to 1939, when he retired.  He holds degrees both of law and of 
medicine. He was called as a witness by appellants and developed the theme of the article further as follows: ""If GHA expanded its activities to a point where it took over a substantial part of the people of the District of Columbia - rich and 
poor alike, - the United States Government subsidizing its services - it is quite obvious that the various doctors in the District of 
Columbia, with their plants, with their experience, and everything else, would not be able to compete on a fair, honest basis; and 
that is when medical practice would be broken down by the subsidized practice, tending to destroy the medical profession."" The record reveals other similar statements of which the following are examples: ""I think it would be exceedingly unfortunate to 
stabilize the income of the medical profession, because there is just as much difference in the qualifications of doctors as there 
is in the qualifications of stenographers.  Some of them can do it and some of them are rotten.  * * * It would be unfortunate to 
stabilize the pay of doctors."" "" * * * let us * * * consider what would happen in the District of Columbia provided you were able to obtain the maximum of 
enrollment in this corporation.  * * * you see what it would do here as an economic thing.* * * It would simply result in the 
necessary exodus of a large part of the medical profession of the District of Columbia, * * * ."" "
465,," "" * * * Quite naturally, however, the organized profession is insisting upon not being forced by misguided or unfair competition to 
give up any of its rightful prerogatives."" ""The question has many implications.  * * * About all the outside doctor would have to do would be to take care of the indigent 
and the riff-raff and the members who had been dropped by the club."" ""Dr. McGovern said that he looked upon this Group Health Association movement as an organization coming in and interfering 
with his business. He added that he expected to be in practice for some 20 years and he did not propose, if it could be avoided 
at all, to have an organization such as was proposed to interfere with his work and income.  'Just what are you fellows going to 
do about it?"" He cited the instance of the musicians who had succeeded in preventing the Marine Band from cutting in on their 
business in playing before assemblies without cost to the sponsors.  * * * The lawyers as a group had prevented inroads in their 
business.  'It just doesn't seem that we are active in preventing the National Government from entering the practice of medicine 
and interfering with our business.  It should be demanded from the American Medical Association that they send a man down 
here now and see just what could be done.'"" [Italics supplied] "" * * * corporation practice of medicine * * * in the District of Columbia threatens to have a far reaching and deleterious effect on 
the private practice of medicine."" "" * * * one is compelled to wonder what will become of the private practice of medicine in those centers if the government is to 
subsidize cut-rate medical schemes.  * * * "" Maintenance of ""free and fair competition"" was the theme of defendants' request for instruction No. 31, refused by the trial court 
which read in part: "" * * * the defendants were entitled, both collectively and individually, to adopt and carry out reasonable 
regulations in professional practice for the purpose of maintaining free and fair competition in the District of Columbia and * * * 
any restraints caused thereby upon Group Health Association, Inc., its doctors, members or operations, without more, would not 
violate the Sherman Act."""
465,24," Group Health Association is described in the indictment as follows: ""33.  Group Health Association, Inc., was incorporated on 
February 19, 1937, and authorized to do business under and by virtue of the laws of Congress for the District of Columbia.  Said 
corporation is a non-profit, cooperative association of employees of certain departments in the executive branch of the United 
States Government employed in the District of Columbia.  Most members of Group Health Association, Inc., are embraced within 
the low income group, over 80% of them earning annual incomes of not more than $2,000.  Said corporation is engaged in the 
District of Columbia in the business of arranging for the provision of medical care and hospitalization to its members and their 
dependents on a risk sharing prepayment basis.  Said corporation collects monthly payments in the form of dues from its 
members.  Medical care is provided by a medical staff consisting of salaried general practitioners and specialists engaged in 
group practice under the sole direction of a medical director.  Said corporation pays adequate salaries to the doctors on its 
medical staff and provides the medical staff with a modern, well equipped clinic, which was opened on November 1, 1937.  Said 
corporation also defrays, within limits, the expenses of hospitalization of its members and their dependents.  The personal 
relationship ordinarily existing between doctor and patient obtains between the doctors on the medical staff of Group Health 
Association, Inc. and their Group Health Association, Inc. patients."""
465,25," ""Evidence has been permitted in this case with respect to the public need or lack of need of so-called low-cost medicine. I 
charge you that any need, or lack of need, for a low-cost medicine plan, has nothing to do with the right of the defendants to 
exercise their lawful powers and duties in connection with the practice of the medical profession. The rights of Group Health 
Association, Inc. are no greater because of an alleged need for low-cost medicine, than if no such need existed.  Group Health 
Association, Inc. had a lawful right to disapprove of what it may have thought was the attitude of the defendants toward low-cost 
medicine plans, just as the defendants had an equal right to disapprove of what the defendants thought was the attitude of 
Group Health Association, Inc. with respect to low-cost medicine plans.  Each party to the controversy had the right to further 
and advance its own opinion in the controversy by all methods of legitimate persuasion and reasoned argument whether applied 
to members of the medical profession, the Washington hospitals, or the public.  Refused.  J.M.P."" "
466,26," That appellants' attack on Group Health was for the purpose of restraining competition is admitted, by implication, also in their 
opening brief: "" * * * that a corporation known as the Twentieth Century Fund with assets of approximately $3,500,000, and 
whose main objective was to actively promote the organization of group payment agencies, i.e., organizations through which 
groups of people might obtain all-around medical and hospital care in return for some fixed periodic payments, was subsidizing 
GHA and enabling it to sell medical services at less that cost for the purpose of destroying the private practice of medicine and 
to set up in its place or stead a theory of the distribution of medical services advocated by such Fund; that HOLC was diverting 
Government moneys to subsidize GHA and thereby enabling it to sell medical services at less than cost; * * * ."""

physician his country had known.  There short decades passed, and an outstanding American physician of the next generation 
found himself revaluing Ruch's medical essays.  The results were rather startling.  'It may be safely said,' observed Elisha 
Bartlett in 1843, 'that in the whole vast compass of medical literature, there cannot be found an equal number of pages 
containing a greater amount and variety of utter nonsense and unqualified absurdity.' A more sudden and extreme revision of 
scientific opinion could hardly be imagined.  Here was Ruch lauded by one generation and repudiated by the next."""
470,64," Shryock, id. at 371-372: ""Hence there gradually evolved, in educated minds, a syllogism of some such form as this: Medical 
science can now prevent or cure certain major diseases.  Many people continue to suffer from these very diseases.  Ergo, "
471,," medical science does not serve the people as it should.  The most obvious explanation was to be found in the mounting costs of 
service.Here, again, it is to be noted that it was the very progress which physicians had made in science, which involved them in 
new difficulties in the practice of their art.Technical improvement led to simultaneous increase in the demand for medical 
services and in ther price that must be paid for them.  And so the more that people trusted medical aid, the less they could afford 
it.  Here was a serious and unexpected impasse in the public relations of the profession."""
471,65," Shryock, id. at 399-400: ""In 1926 some fifteen leaders in medicine, public health, and the social sciences had inaugurated a 
series of conferences which led to the creation of a national Committee on the Costs of Medical Care.  This body consisted of 
fifty members drawn from various interested groups rainging from private practitioners to economists.Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, 
Secretary of the Interior in President Hoover's cabinet, served as Chairman.  * * * The Committee carried out a nation-wide 
survey of sickness and medical service among nearly nine thousand white families.  Their reports revealed, by 1932, a direct 
correlation between income and all types of medical service; and tended in general to substantiate the claims made by the 
advocates of health insurance more than a decade before.  The lowest income group (under $1,200 per year) received more of 
certain types of care - presumably due to charity services - than did the next two higher groups ($1,200 to $3,000); but in general 
these classes all received much less service than those whose incomes were above the last-named amount.  Thus the group 
with the lowest amount of service received only 50 per cent as many days of hospitalization, and only 41 per cent as many 
medical calls as did the group with the highest amount of service.  In every case, the latter was the highest income group.  The 
highest group itself received less medical service than the standard which the majority of the Committee considered essential to 
good care."" The American Medical Associaion, it is true, disagrees with the conclusions of these eminent professionals.  Shryock, id. at 401:

investigation which '* * * revealed the fact that there are few, if any, people in the United States really suffering from lack of

474,87," For example, in 1936, the State Medical Society of Wisconsin disapproved a plan proposed for the care of employees of the 
International Harvester Company.The proponents of this plan, who were members of the States Society, refused to resign, and 
were subsequently tried, found guilty and expelled from the Society on the ground of violations of the By-Laws of the Society and 
the Principles of Medical Ethics.  The Expelled members appealed to the Judicial Council of the American Medical Association, 
which affirmed the action of the State Society.  As appears from the opinion of the judicial Council, the features of the plan were 
as follows: ""1.  Unlimited medical and surgical service for $1.00 per month for a single man; $2.00 per month for man and wife; 
$3.00 per month for man, wife and family.  2.  Only diseases excluded from the plan - mental and contagious.  Hospitalization 
not included.  3.  There would be no solicitiation of patients. 4.  All physicians who joined the clinic would benefit from any profits.  
5.  Patients may select any physician on the staff. 6.  Preventive treatment not included in the plan.  7.  No written contract 
between patient and clinic.  Participants in plan restricted to those with income of $200.00 or less per month."" "
475,," The opinion of the Judicial Council also stated that: ""The Judicial Council is distinctly of the opinion that practice under the terms 
and conditions to which these appellants have agreed with the employees of the International Harvester Company constitutes a 
violation of Chapter III, Art, VI, (Revised) Sec. 3, of the Principles of Medical Ethics (contract practice contrary to sound public 
policy)."" In the meantime and following the action of the State Society, Dr. Cutter, Secretary of the Association, had written the 
Superintendent of Mount Sinai Hospital, Miliwaukee, Wisconsin, in the following language: ""It has come to our attention, through 
correspondence with the Medical Society of Milwaukee County, that certain physicians have been expelled from that society 
through participation in an organization known as 'Milwaukee Medical Center.' It is also reported that certain of these same 
individuals continue as members of your attending staff with hospital privileges.  May we call your attention to the recent 
resolution passed by the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association, as follows: 'Resolved, That it is the opinion of 
the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association that physicians on the staffs of hospitals approved for intern 
training by the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals should be limited to members in good standing of their local county 
medical societies and that the House of Delegates requests the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals to take this under 
advisement.' What possibility, if any, exists for observance of the principle laid down in this resolution?"" After a series of temporizing correspondence, Dr. Cutter again addressed the Superintendent of Mount Sinai Hospital as follows: 
""In view of the fact that we have receiverd no reply to our letter of May 5 and no notification of any action taken with respect to 
the employment of physicians expelled from the county medical society, we wish to inform youn that we are recomending to the 
Council that Mount Sinai Hospital be romved from the approved intern list and also from the Register of the American Medical 
Association."" One week later the Superintendent of Mount Sinai Hospital wrote Dr. Cutter that the objectionable physicians had been denied 
further staff and courtesy privileges at Mount Sinai Hospital by vote of the Executive Committee."

499,1," The petition was filed on December 1, 1937.  Preliminary matters having intervened and been disposed of, the cause came on 
for trial on January 16, 1941.  It was not finally submitted, however, until May 23, 1941. After its submission legislation was proposed in Congress permitting the consolidation and merger of domestic telegraph carriers 
and it was stated in the newspapers that the President of the United States favored such merger in the interest of the war effort. Because of this, a conference was held, attended by the court and counsel for the respective parties, with a view to determining 
what further should be done in the instant case, if anything.  At that time counsel for the Government expressed some doubt as 
to the proposed legislation being enacted.  Subsequently, however, it was enacted and signed by the President and on May 13, 
1943, a contract was signed between Western Union and Postal agreeing on a plan for merger. In view of the proposed and pending legislation -- and after conference with counsel -- a decision in this cause was postponed.  
After the enactment of the legislation, to-wit, on May 11, 1943, (two days before the signing of the Agreement above referred to) 
a further conference was held by the court and counsel.  The transcript of the minutes of that conference shows the following: ""The Court: Let the record show that on this date, May 11, 1943, at two o'clock p.m., pursuant to correspondence heretofore had 
between the various counsel present and the Court, a conference was held in the United States Court House in New York City, 
the main purpose of which was to determine whether or not, in view of the present status of the merger legislation and the things 
that are being done thereunder by the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Postal Telegraph Company, it is expedient 
and proper for the Court to decide the case of United States v. Western Union Telegraph Company, et al., Equity No. 86-129, or 
whether a decision in the case should be held in abeyance until some future time, with the possibility that it might not be 
necessary or even essential to decide the case at all.  After conference and consultation between all the parties and the Court, it 
appears that the Government, represented by Miss Brass, Special Attorney, Department of Justice, and Mr. Lynch, Assistant 
United States Attorney, is of the opinion that the Court should proceed with reasonable dispatch to decide the case.  It is the 
view of Mr. Stark, representing the Western Union Telegraph Company and other defendants, that the Court might well wait at 
least until further steps have been taken in the merger proceedings with a view to deciding whether the case should finally be 
determined or not.  Miss Brass states that it is the view of the Department of Justice, however, that even though the merger 
should become an accomplished fact, nevertheless the Government desires this case decided by the Court because of the 
possibility of some similar situation arising in the years to come with some other telegraph company or similar organization.  
Miss Brass, does what I have dictated to the reporter cover your views and did I properly state the expression of the 
Government? ""Miss Brass: Yes, that is right. ""The Court: Mr. Lynch, that expresses your views, too? Mr. Lynch: It expresses the views of the Government. ""The Court: And, Mr. Stark, have I correctly stated your views? ""Mr. Stark: Yes, sir.  * * * ""The Court: * * * I would like to have the record show what I have already mentioned, that I was prompted in doing this, having 
this conference and holding the matter off, because it was my impression, perhaps an erroneous impression, but it was my 
impression, that at the last conference we had the thought was there would not likely be a merger and, therefore, I might just as 
well go ahead and decide the case.  Subsequently I heard from Mr. Stark and through the public press that this enabling 
legislation had been passed, and I had already seen in the papers that the President thought this merger should take place as 
part of the war effort.  I did not want to do anything that I thought would in any way interfere with that, and I say that without "
500,," presuming, or meaning to presume, that a decision by this court would in any way interfere with it.  I just thought I should have 
the expression of counsel, but I think we all understand alike now.  * * * ""Miss Brass: Of course, there is still the possibility the thing may not go through; there may never be a merger. ""Mr. Stark: That is possible. ""Miss Brass: And it could be, if the merger does go through very shortly, as you seem to think it will, that after it is in operation, 
we might see how it operates.  Maybe, if the case is decided, they will not take that position, but we do feel now, regardless of 
whether or not we have a merger, we would like to have it decided. ""The Court: And would you state what you stated a while ago, if I understood it correctly, that even if the merger became 
accomplished, you would still want the case decided, the Government would, because you felt there might be new companies in 
the future, or something of the kind? ""Miss Brass: Yes. ""The Court: What was that statement?  Would you put that in the record please? ""Miss Brass: All right.  Even if there is a merger at some time in the future, the Department would like to have the case decided 
because the act permitting the merger provides that new companies may come into the telegraph field upon receiving a 
certificate of convenience and necessity from the Federal Communications Commission.  The act also provides that the 
International telegraph companies may have feeder lines at various cities throughout the United States for the purpose of 
receiving and transmitting messages by international telegraph. For this reason, the field should be kept open so that the 
facilities needed by the international telegraph companies would be available."" "
531,1," The ""allied lines"" of insurance handled by appellees are described in the indictment as ""inland navigation and transportation, 
inland marine, sprinkler leakage, explosion, windstorm and tornado, extended coverage, use and occupancy, and riot and civil 
commotion insurance."""
531,2," The pertinent provisions of §§ 1 and 2 of the Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 1 and 2, commonly 
known as the Sherman Act, are as follows: ""Sec. 1.  HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal: . . .  Every person who shall make any

or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor, . . ."""
531,3," The indictment does not state the proportion of fire insurance and ""allied lines"" sold by stock companies, as distinguished from 
mutuals, etc., in the six states involved.  But it does state that ""stock companies receive approximately 85% of the total premium 
income of all fire insurance companies operating in the United States."""

531,5," The appellees include all of the individuals and companies named as defendants in the indictment except the Universal 
Insurance Company and the Kansas City Fire and Marine Insurance Company, neither of which joined in the demurrer to the 
indictment. "
532,6," Although the District Court also sustained two additional grounds of demurrer (that the indictment did not state facts sufficient to 
constitute a federal offense, and that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter), the opinion makes clear it did so 
because of the conclusion that ""the business of insurance is not commerce."" Two further grounds of demurrer, based upon the 
Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Amendments, were not considered by the District Court."
532,7," See 56 Stat. 271 amending 34 Stat. 1246; 18 U. S. C. 682; United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 192-193. Appellees 
contend that the District Court read both counts of the indictment as alleging that the trade or commerce sought to be restrained 
and monopolized was the business of selling fire insurance, that the Court rightly decided that such business was not 
commerce, and that therefore its judgment should be affirmed.  The Government denies that the Court construed the indictment 
so narrowly.  It insists that the first count of the indictment charges a violation of § 1 of the Act regardless of whether the 
insurance business itself be commerce, since that count charges that the practices of the fire insurance companies constituted 
an unlawful restraint of interstate trade or commerce in such fields as transportation and industry which must purchase fire 
insurance. Cf. Polish Alliance v. Labor Board, post, p. 643.  In the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to pass upon this 
question.  We consider the case on the assumption that appellees' contention on this point is correct. "

from ordinary commercial transactions, and, as we have seen, according to the sense of the world from the earliest times -- 
certainly the sense of the modern world -- is of the greatest public concern."" German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, 233 U.S. 389, 
414-415. "

home offices in or near New York City.  Best's Life Reports, 1939, as summarized in Monograph 28 printed for the use of the 
Temporary National Economic Committee, Appendix A (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1940).  Each of these companies is 
licensed in every state of the Union except that two of them are not licensed in Texas.  Life Insurance Year Book, 1942-3. The five largest stock fire and marine insurance companies, owning total assets of approximately $ 550,000,000, are similarly 
located.  Best's 1943 Digest of Insurance Stocks, xxxii.  And each does business in every state of the Union.  Ibid."
534,16," The amounts given as premiums collected and losses paid during the period 1931-1941 are for all stock fire insurance 
companies operating in the six states involved.  The companies which were parties to the alleged conspiracies probably 
collected and paid about 90% of these amounts since they controlled that percentage of the total business."
534,17," ""The defect of the argument lies in the character of their business.  Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of 
commerce. The policies are simple contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the corporations and the 
assured, for a consideration paid by the latter.  These contracts are not articles of commerce in any proper meaning of the word.  
They are not subjects of trade and barter offered in the market as something having an existence and value independent of the "
535,," parties to them.  They are not commodities to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another, and then put up for sale.  They 
are like other personal contracts between parties which are completed by their signature and the transfer of the consideration.  
Such contracts are not inter-state transactions, though the parties may be domiciled in different States.  The policies do not take 
effect -- are not executed contracts -- until delivered by the agent in Virginia.  They are, then, local transactions, and are 
governed by the local law."" 8 Wall. 168, 183."

536,23," That the decisions of this Court upholding state insurance laws do not necessarily constitute a denial of federal power to 
regulate insurance has, upon occasion, been recognized both by insurance executives and lawyers.  See, for example, An 
Address on the Regulation of Insurance By Congress, by John F. Dryden, President, Prudential Insurance Company of America, 
delivered November 22, 1904, pp. 12-13: ""The decision [Paul v. Virginia], and those that have followed, did not relate to the real 
point involved in a consideration of the regulation of the insurance business as interstate commerce by the Federal government. 
. . .  It is the opinion of qualified authorities who have given most careful consideration to this aspect of the subject . . . that under 
the implied and resulting powers of the Constitution the Supreme Court would not withhold the verdict of constitutionality from an 
act of Congress declaring interstate insurance to be interstate commerce."" See, similarly, Insurance is Commerce, by George F. 
Seward, President, The Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York (1910) pp. 15-16; S. S. Huebner, Federal Supervision and 
Regulation of Insurance, Annals, Amer. Acad. of Pol. and Soc. Science, Vol. xxvi, No. 3 (1905) 681-707.  But see, e. g., contra:

Supervision of Insurance (N. Y. 1905) pp. 12-20. The report of the Committee on Insurance Law of the American Bar Association, in 1906, discussing the constitutionality of

541,45," We have been pointed to only one reference made to the business of insurance in the Congressional discussions preceding 
passage of the Sherman Act, and that is a statement of Senator Turpie which flatly challenged the reasoning of this Court in 
holding that insurance was not commerce, and further predicted that in the future the Commerce Clause would not be given 
such a limited construction: ""The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Vest] spoke the other day about the difficulty of defining the word 'commerce,' especially as 
contained in the phrase 'interstate commerce.' I recollect one judicial decision upon this subject very definitely.  The Supreme 
Court has decided that insurance is not commerce, and I suppose by following the circle of negations long enough and excluding 
all the things not commerce we should come at last to the residuum, which must be commerce or interstate commerce, because 
it can be nothing else.  A fortiori, judging from this principle, I should myself have decided that transportation is not commerce 
nor interstate commerce either. . . . ""I feel inclined to make the prediction, as one of the things to come in this vast domain, scarcely touched, of cases arising under 
the Constitution and laws of Congress, that the whole mass of merchantable paper known as negotiable by the law merchant, 
made at one place, negotiable at another, payable at another, transcending in its negotiation State lines, will be remitted to 
Congressional action, and with respect to its creation, its formation, its negotiation, with respect to all the rights and liabilities 
which may arise under it, the people, stunned with the eternal dissonance of conflicting decisions and judgments of forty-eight or 
fifty tribunals of last resort in the States upon the subject of interstate negotiable paper, will require Congress to act therein, and 
that, unconstitutional as I now deem it or think it, it will as a matter of necessity be done, and in any such legislation with respect 
to that paper, the whole bulk of it, the personal and peculiar conditions of litigants will not be inquired about, but simply whether 
the one party or the other is entitled to relief or liable to recovery against him by reason of being a party to interstate commercial 
paper, negotiable and payable and suable under the action of Congress which may finally take place upon that subject. . . . ""Nor do I think with the Senator from New York that we are discharged from duty or released from our obligation to legislate 
upon the subject of trusts because the States have a right to do so."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2556-2557. And see Note 48, infra."
541,46," Senator George, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee which redrafted the Sherman Act before its final passage, 
stated on the floor of the Senate that, ""The bill has been very ingeniously and properly drawn to cover every case which comes 
within what is called the commercial power of Congress. . . .  It is well known that the great evil of these combinations, these 
conspiracies, as they are called, these monopolies, as they are denominated by the bill, consists in the fact that by combination, 
by association, there have been gathered together the money and the means of large numbers of persons, and under these 
combinations, or conspiracies, or trusts, this great aggregated capital is wielded by a single hand and guided by a single brain, 
or at least by hands and brains acting in complete harmony and co-operation, and that in this way, by this association, by this "
542,," direction of this immense amount of capital, by one organized will, to a very large extent, these wrongs have been perpetrated 
upon the American people."" 21 Cong. Rec. 3147. Earlier, Senator Sherman had explained, ""I do not wish to single out any particular trust or combination.  It is not a particular 
trust, but the system I aim at."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2457.  And in the House, Representative Stewart, delivering the last speech 
preceding the unanimous adoption of the present Act, stated "". . . HN12[
] The provisions of this trust bill are just as broad, 
sweeping, and explicit as the English language can make them to express the power of Congress over this subject under the 
Constitution of the United States. . . ."" 21 Cong. Rec. 6314. Compare Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1 and United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, with Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. 
United States, 175 U.S. 211 and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106."
542,47," Senator Sherman, explaining his bill to the Senate, stated, ""It is to arm the Federal courts within the limits of their constitutional 
power that they may co-operate with the State courts in checking, curbing, and controlling the most dangerous combinations that 
now threaten the business, property, and trade of the people of the United States."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2457."
542,48," For example, the following colloquy occurred in the House during the debate in passage of the Clayton Act: ""Mr. BARTON.  We had an illustration recently where a big fire insurance company came into the State where local insurance 
companies have been doing business, not confined to the border of the State, and cut prices in that immediate locality until we 
had in three States 40 or 50 local companies put out of business, and then the price was put back where it was profitable to the 
company.  Might not this same condition exist where we started a wholesale house in a State where their territory was confined 
to the State -- might it not be a reduction of prices for putting that institution out of business? ""Mr. WEBB.  If the purpose is to wrongfully injure or destroy a competitor, this section will cover such practice; but insurance 
companies are not reached, as the Supreme Court has held that their contracts or policies are not interstate commerce. ""Mr. BARTON.  Is it not right that they should come within the law? ""Mr. WEBB.  Yes."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9390. So far as appears, this was the only mention of the insurance cases during the discussions leading to passage of the Clayton 
Act.  And, as in 1890, when the Sherman Act was under consideration, the reference to these cases showed dissatisfaction with 
them.  See note 45, supra."
542,49," § 29 (b), 41 Stat. 988, 1000. "
543,50," Whether reliance on earlier statements of this Court in the Paul v. Virginia line of cases that insurance is not ""commerce"" could 
ever be pleaded as a defense to a criminal prosecution under the Sherman Act is a question which has been suggested but one 
it is not necessary to discuss at this time. "
545,1," It charges an agreement (a) to fix premium rates, (b) to fix commissions paid, (c) to adopt reclassifications of risks on the basis 
of which premium rates are fixed, (d) to adhere to standard terms, conditions, and clauses, in the insurance contract, (e) to 
withhold reinsurance facilities from non-members of the South-Eastern Underwriters Association, (f) to withdraw from and refuse 
to enter agencies representing non-members, (g) to boycott and withhold patronage from purchasers of insurance from non-
members, (h) to disparage the services and facilities of non-members, (i) to establish and maintain rating bureaus to police and 
maintain these agreements, (j) to establish and maintain boards and groups of agents for the same purpose.  There is no 
allegation that commissions are paid otherwise than on the entering into of the contracts.  The indictment thus charges only 
restraints in the terms of the insurance contracts and restraints, by boycotts, in competition in entering into such contracts and in 
entering into contracts of reinsurance."

548,3," The decisions of this Court that the negotiation of a contract between citizens of different states is not interstate commerce 
were known to and accepted by Congress.  In the course of the debates in the Senate on the original bill introduced by Senator 
Sherman, Senator Turpie, discussing the extent of the federal commerce power, stated, ""I recollect one judicial decision upon 
this subject very definitely.  The Supreme Court has decided that insurance is not commerce. . . ."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2556.  During 
subsequent debates on that bill Senator Hoar, who later took charge of the revised bill reported by the Judiciary Committee and 
ultimately enacted, 21 Cong. Rec. 3145 et seq., denied the existence of federal substantive power, under the commerce clause 
or Article III, § 2, over contracts between citizens of different states, asserting that Senator Sherman's bill could be supported 
only as a regulation of the ""importation, transportation, or sale of articles. . . ."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2567.  See also the statements of 
Senator Eustis at 21 Cong. Rec. 2646, 2651-2."

see the statement of Senator Edmunds, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill in the form in 
which it passed, that in drafting that bill the committee thought that ""we would frame a bill that should be clearly within our "
549,," constitutional power, that we should make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it 
to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its definitions as applicable to each particular case as it 
might arise."" 21 Cong. Rec. 3148.  Similarly Senator Hoar, a member of that committee who with Senator Edmunds was in 
charge of the bill, stated ""Now we are dealing with an offense against interstate or international commerce, which the State can 
not regulate by penal enactment, and we find the United States without any common law.  The great thing that this bill does, 
except affording a remedy, is to extend the common-law principles, which protected fair competition in trade in old times in 
England, to international and interstate commerce in the United States."" 21 Cong. Rec. 3152."

549,9," Compare the debates in the House on the bill, S. 569, to establish a Department of Commerce and Labor.  As reported by the 
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, § 6 of the bill provided for the creation of a bureau of insurance to 
""exercise such control as may be provided by law"" over insurance companies and to ""foster, promote, and develop"" the 
insurance business by collecting and compiling statistics.  H. R. Rep. No. 2970, 57th Cong., 2d Sess., 12, 15.  After extended 
debate, in which the provision was objected to for want of power in the federal government to regulate the insurance business 
and as a threat to the continuance of existing state regulation, 36 Cong. Rec. 868-9, 872-3, 908-11, 919-21, and in which it was 
insisted by proponents of the bill, as now, that insurance is commerce, 36 Cong. Rec. 876-7, amendments to strike all reference 
to insurance from the bill were adopted.  36 Cong. Rec. 911, 921.  A proposed amendment to prohibit the use of the mails by 
insurance companies doing business in violation of state law was likewise defeated.  36 Cong. Rec. 922-3.  The conference 
committee then inserted the provision, adopted as § 6 of the Act, 32 Stat. 828, authorizing the Bureau of Corporations to compile 
and publish useful information concerning corporations doing business in the United States and engaged in interstate or foreign 
commerce, ""including corporations engaged in insurance."" Upon assurances that this section ""simply authorizes information 
being secured"" and that ""there is nothing in this measure that contravenes the votes of the House on that subject,"" 36 Cong. 
Rec. 2008, the conference report was adopted.  The insurance provisions were not in the bill as it had originally passed the 
Senate, and the conference report was adopted by that body without debate.  36 Cong. Rec. 1990, 2035-6. The Commissioner of Corporations made a study of state legislation, but reported that ""in view of the decisions of the Supreme 
Court I have not felt warranted in trying to assume jurisdiction over insurance companies for the purpose of investigation.""

550,10," Mr. Webb's statement was made in answer to an inquiry by Mr. Barton as to whether the proposed section 2 of the Clayton Act 
would render illegal certain practices if engaged in by wholesalers, in the course of which Mr. Barton referred to an instance of 
such practices committed by insurance companies.  The colloquy continued: ""Mr. BARTON.  It is not right that they should come within the law? Mr. WEBB.  Yes."" Assuming that Mr. Webb's answer related to insurance companies, and expressed a desire that such companies should be 
included within the prohibitions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, but were not, nothing was done to amend those Acts so as to 
carry out that desire or which would require this Court to reexamine the scope of federal power over insurance."

555,11," It is impossible to believe that Congress, if it ever intended to assume responsibility for general regulation of insurance, would 
have made the antitrust laws the sole manifestation of its purpose.  Its only command is to refrain from restraints of trade.  
Intelligent insurance regulation goes much further.  It requires careful supervision to ascertain and protect solvency, regulation 
which may be inconsistent with unbridled rate competition.  It prescribes some provisions of policies of insurance and many 
other matters beyond the scope of the Sherman Act. Also it requires sanctions for obedience far more effective than the $ 5,000 maximum fine on corporations prescribed by the 
antitrust laws.  Violation of state laws are commonly punishable by cancellation of permission to do business therein -- a drastic 
sanction that really commands respect. The antitrust law sanctions are little better than absurd when applied to huge corporations engaged in great enterprise.  In the 
two related Madison Oil cases (see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150) fifteen of the seventeen 
corporations convicted had combined capital and surplus reported to be $ 2,833,516,247.  The total corporate fines on them 
were $ 255,000, making a ratio of fines to corporate capital and surplus of less than 1/100 of 1 per cent.  In addition, fines of $ 
180,000 were assessed against individuals.  In the automobile financing case (see United States v. General Motors Corp., "
556,121," F.2d 376, cert. denied, 314 U.S. 618) General Motors Corporation, three wholly owned subsidiaries and no individuals were 
convicted.  The fines were $ 20,000.  Capital and surplus were then reported at $ 1,047,840,321, the fine being somewhat less 
than 1/500 of 1 per cent thereof. In each case the corporate fines were $ 5,000, the maximum permitted by the statute.  15 U. S. C. § 1."
556,12," The last agency to investigate insurance problems was the Temporary National Economic Committee.  It made no 
recommendation of federal control.  Its chairman, Senator O'Mahoney, after reviewing carefully the problems caused by the 
concentration of economic power in the hands of the insurance companies and the abuses of the business, said: ""Therefore I 
say again that personally I would not support any law that would undertake to do away with state regulation of insurance, and 
there never has been suggested to me or to any member of the TNEC or to the committee as a whole any thought of doing away 
with state regulation or imposing federal supervision."" 26 American Bar Association Journal 913.  Both dominant political parties 
have supported the present system.  In 1940, the Democratic platform contained this provision: ""We favor strict supervision of all 
forms of the insurance business by the several States for the protection of policyholders and the public."" The Republican 
platform of that year contained this provision: ""We favor a continuance of regulation of insurance by the several States."""

556,14," See Insurance Blue Book (Centennial Issue, 1876) Ch. VI, Fire Insurance, p. 32."
556,15," In 1866, a bill was introduced in the House, providing for creation of a national bureau of insurance in the Treasury 
Department.  It was not passed.  H. R. 738, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. In 1868, a bill was introduced in the Senate proposing a national bureau of insurance, but never passed.  S. 299, 40th Cong., 2d

regulate insurance, and said: ""The views of the Supreme Court have practically met the approval of the bar and business men of 
the United States as being in accordance with law and common sense."" H. R. Rep. 2491, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., March 23,

effect that Congress should have power to regulate the business or commerce of insurance throughout the United States and its 
territories or possessions.  The resolutions were not reported out of the Judiciary Committee.  S. J. Res. 103, 63d Cong., 2d 
Sess.; H. J. Res. 194, 63d Cong., 2d Sess.; S. J. Res. 58, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. In 1933, a resolution was introduced for a similar constitutional amendment which died in committee.  S. J. Res. 51, 73d Cong.,

557,," Moreover, by exceptions and exemptions Congress has indicated a clear intent to avoid interference with state supervision. 
Insurance corporations are excepted from those who may become bankrupts.  11 U. S. C. § 22. Insurance issued by any issuer 
under state supervision is exempted from the Securities Act.  15 U. S. C. § 77c (a) (8).  Insurance companies supervised by 
state authority are exempted from regulation as investment companies.  15 U. S. C. §§ 80a-2 (a) (17) and 80a-3 (c) (3)."
557,16," In New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, 231 U.S. 495, 502, the Court said: ""To reverse the cases, therefore, would 
require us to promulgate a new rule of constitutional inhibition upon the States and which would compel a change of their policy 
and a readjustment of their laws.  Such result necessarily urges against a change of decision."""
557,17," In resisting pressure to federalize insurance supervision Congress has followed the advice of some of the best informed 
champions of the public interest on insurance problems.  One was Louis D. Brandeis.  Speaking as counsel for the Protective 
Committee of Policy-holders in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, before the Commercial Club of Boston, on October 26, 
1905, Mr. Brandeis said: ""The sole effect of a Federal law would be -- the sole purpose of the Dryden bill [see note 15, supra] must have been -- to free 
the companies from the careful scrutiny of the commissioners of some of the States.  It seeks to rob the State even of the right to 
protect its own citizens from the legalized robbery to which present insurance measures subject the citizens, for by the terms of 
the bill a Federal license would secure the right to do business within the borders of the State, regardless of the State 
prohibitions, free from the State's protective regulations. With a frankness which is unusual -- and an effrontery which is common 
-- among the insurance magnates -- this bill is introduced in the Senate by John F. Dryden, the president of the Prudential Life 
Insurance Company -- the company which pays to stockholders annual dividends equivalent to 219.78 per cent. for each dollar 
paid in on the stock; the company which devotes itself mainly to insuring the working men at an expense of over 37.28 cents on 
every dollar of premiums paid; the company which, in 1904, made the worst record of lapsed and surrendered industrial policies. 
. . . ""Federal supervision is also advocated by Mr. James M. Beck (formerly Assistant Attorney General of the United States), the 
counsel for the Mutual Life Insurance Company, and his main argument against State supervision appears to be that the 
companies pay, in the aggregate, for fees and taxes in the several States $ 10,000,000, which he says is twice as much as is 
necessary to cover the expense of proper supervision. Ten million dollars is a large sum in itself, but a very small one compared 
with the aggregate assets or the aggregate expense of management.  Mr. Beck's company paid in 1904 $ 1,138,663 in taxes 
and fees.  Its management expenses were $ 15,517,520, or nearly fourteen times as much.  Our Massachusetts savings banks 
paid in the year ending October 31, 1904, $ 1,627,794.46 in taxes to this Commonwealth: that is $ 80,890.02 more than the 
whole expense of management, which was $ 1,546,904.44. ""Doubtless the insurance departments of some States are subjects for just criticism.  In many of the States the department is 
inefficient, in some doubtless corrupt.  But is there anything in our experience of Federal supervision of other departments of 
business which should lead us to assume that it will be freer from grounds of criticism or on the whole more efficient than the 
best insurance department of any of the States?  For it must be remembered that an efficient supervision by the department of 
any State will in effect protect all the policyholders of the company wherever they may reside.  Let us remember rather the 
ineffectiveness for eighteen long years of the Interstate Commerce Commission to deal with railroad abuses, the futile 
investigation by Commissioner Garfield of the Beef Trust, and the unfinished investigation into the affairs of the Oil Trust in which 
he has since been engaged.  Federal supervision would serve only to centralize still further the power of our Government and to 
increase still further the powers of the corporations."" Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous Court wrote, in Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co., 275 U.S. 274, 276 (1927): ""A contract of 
insurance, although made with a corporation having its office in a State other than that in which the insured resides and in which 
the interest insured is located, is not interstate commerce."" He joined in other similar decisions in Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. 
Co. v. Wisconsin, 247 U.S. 132; National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U.S. 71. "
558,18," Thirty-five states of the Union have filed amicus curiae briefs with us, protesting against the decision which the Court is 
promulgating. "
565,1," In the latter two cases, which involved electrical trade, the indictment charged explicitly refusal to work on any but electrical 
equipment manufactured or assembled in New York City. "
567,2," The evidence does not show concert of action between the San Franicsco group and the East Bay group.  Rather, it discloses 
that each group of employers and employes acted within its own areas.  And the mere fact that they followed the same pattern 
and that some members of the San Francisco employer group helped the Oakland and Contra Costa group establish a 
depository system of their own, does not prove one conspiracy. Nor is the fact that the International approved the form of the agreement with both employer groups, by endorsing, indirectly, the 
""depository"" system, constitute the binding tie which makes all parties to one agreement. "
568,3," I treated this subject fully in my dissent in Brown v. Parker, D.C.1941, 39 F.Supp. 895, 903. The Supreme Court up-held these 
views in Parker v. Brown, supra. By ""processing"" I really mean ""construction."" In the strictly ""processing"" cases, there is no ""building"" of a system.  There is but a change in an object which continues to retain 
its identity, such as the slaughtering and dressing of chickens, the dressing of furs, the grinding of a lens from a lens blank, or 
the cleaning, stemming or packing of raisins. See: Live Poultry Dealers' Protective Ass'n, 2 Cir., 1924, 4 F.2d 840; Greater New York Live Poultry Chamber of Commerce v. 
United States, 2 Cir., 1931, 47 F.2d 156; United States v. International Fur Workers Union, 1938, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 541; United 
States v. Univis Lens Co., 1943, 316 U.S. 241, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. 1408; Parker v. Brown, supra. Here there is the construction of a system, which in its very making became a part of a building to which it was attached.  By the 
law of fixtures, it became a part of the land on which the building stood.  Certainly, the ""system"" could not be the object of 
interstate commerce, for it was never in it.  It came into being locally in the state, and never had a detached existence, rendering 
it capable of being traded in interstate commerce, although some of its parts originated in it. "
569,4," The Supreme Court, by denying certiorari in the case, 1943, 317 U.S 695, 63 S.Ct. 436, 87 L.Ed. 556, has approved the 
conclusion that an agreement of this character does not monopolize trade.  What adds strength to this case is the fact that the 
courts had previously found the same defendants guilty of other monopolistic practices in a prosecution under the Sherman Anti-
Trust law. United States v. General Motors Corporation, 1941, 7 Cir., 121 F.2d 376, certiorari denied, 1942, 314 U.S. 618, 62 
S.Ct. 105, 86 L.Ed. 497. "

581,1," This was done after a consent decree had been entered against five of the major distributors in United States v. Paramount 
Pictures, Inc.  This dismissal did not eliminate the charge that these distributors had conspired with the defendant exhibitors to 
restrain and monopolize trade.  And some of the distributors, though dismissed from the case, were found to be co-conspirators 
with the exhibitors in making franchise agreements and in licensing films for the purpose of maintaining the exhibitors' theatre 
monopolies and of preventing the independents from competing. "
582,2," Crescent is used for Crescent Amusement Co.; Cumberland for Cumberland Amusement Co.; Lyric for Lyric Amusement Co., 
Inc.; Cherokee for Cherokee Amusements, Inc.; Kentucky for Kentucky Amusement Co., Inc.; Muscle Shoals for Muscle Shoals 
Theatres; and Rockwood for Rockwood Amusement Co. "
583,3," The defendant exhibitors during the five-year period preceding the filing of this suit paid about 90% of their total film rental to 
the eight major distributors."
583,4," The expansion of the combination during this period was summarized by the District Court as follows: ""On August 11, 1934, the defendant exhibitors and their affiliates operated in thirty-two towns in Tennessee (excluding 
Nashville), Kentucky, and Alabama, in six of which they had competition.  On August 11, 1939, the defendant exhibitors and 
their affiliates, with the exception of Strand, heretofore dismissed as a defendant, operated in seventy-eight towns in Tennessee 
(excluding Nashville), Kentucky, Alabama, and North Carolina, in five of which they had competition, and the only towns in which 
they have competition today outside of Nashville, are Gadsden, Alabama, Harriman, Gallatin and McMinnville, Tennessee, and 
Franklin, Kentucky.  In two of these towns -- Gadsden, Alabama, and Harriman, Tennessee -- the independent theatres have 
opened since the filing of this suit and two more -- Franklin, Kentucky, and Gallatin, Tennessee -- are towns which Crescent 
entered less than two years before the filing of this suit. "
584,," ""Of the forty-five towns in Tennessee listed in the 1940 census as having populations between 2,500 and 10,000, Crescent and 
its affiliates now operate theatres in all but nine.  The independents operating in three of those nine towns have already been 
approached by Sudekum emissaries with the suggestion that they sell to one of the defendant exhibitors."" Their financial growth was found to be ""out of all proportion"" to their physical expansion: ""During the five-year period immediately preceding the suit, the Crescent and Rockwood companies each experienced a 
phenomenal growth in earnings and surplus which was out of all proportion to the increase in gross receipts and gross assets 
resulting from physical expansion of the business and improving general economic conditions.  During the five-year fiscal period 
from June 30, 1934 to June 30, 1939, Crescent's total assets were less than doubled, but its surplus was increased thirty times.  
During the last fiscal year of said period its gross receipts were less than twice the amount of its gross receipts for the first fiscal 
year of said period, but its net profits (exclusive of dividends received) were more than five times those of the first year.  During 
the five-year period, its net earnings (exclusive of dividends received) averaged about 35 per cent per annum, on its 
capitalization."""
584,5," A union of the exhibitor with a distributor in such a program would of course constitute a conspiracy under the Sherman Act as 
held in Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208. "

misdemeanor . . ."" "
622,1," The District Court found "". . . that there has not only been a violation of the anti-trust laws, beginning with the first agreement 
between Hartford and Empire in 1916, but I am convinced that this violation of the laws was as deliberate as any that I can find 
in a review of anti-trust cases."" 46 F.Supp. 541, 552-553. Hartford and Lynch were also found guilty of contracting in violation of 
the Clayton Act."
622,2," Sixteen pages of the trial court's opinion are given to a summary of manifestations of conscious guilt.  The instance cited in the 
opinion of Mr. Justice Black is illustrative.  See also text infra at note 10.  The methods employed ranged from suggestions for 
""cooperation"" to the division of fields within the industry and the squeeze-out of rivals, ruthlessly and constantly through the 
system of licensing and leasing which the court found was ""the greatest abuse."" Cf. text infra at note 15.  Hazel-Atlas was a 
hold-out until the ""three-way partnership"" agreement of 1932.  The long story showing how that company finally was brought 
""within the family"" is particularly interesting in disclosing the methods used in bringing a rival to book. "
623,3," Characterizing the case as ""primarily documentary,"" though also noting the ""reticence of some of the key witnesses to disclose 
what plainly was within their knowledge as principal actors in the main conferences that occurred over a period of time,"" the 
court stated: "". . . in this case, the men who planned and directed the proceedings under scrutiny, from 1916 down to the time of 
the filing of the complaint herein, left behind them numerous exchanges of letters and many memoranda executed 
contemporaneously with the happening of the main events and designed for the information of their contemporaries, their boards 
of directors, or for their successors in office.  It is hard to imagine a case in which a court would have more first-hand information 
of what the parties did and intended than in the case at bar."" (P. 553.)"

institution of this proceeding.  Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power, Sen. Doc. No. 95, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.

624,5," Referring to the defendants' argument ""that the price of glassware to the consumer has not increased,"" the District Court's 
opinion stated (p. 620): ""But again this is not a good defense if there have been violations of the law.  Moreover, the history of 
the case shows the great extent to which automatic machinery has come into use within the past forty years.  It is natural to 
assume that the cost of production would decrease with the great influx of automatic machinery. Evidently the defendants 
managed to retain this saving in the cost of production by means of the conspiracy herein, which is manifested by the large 
profits in the industry.  The benefits certainly were not passed on to the public."" Previously the court had found that, ""Dominance 
over the entire industry is today so complete that at any time within the choice of Hartford and Owens prices to the consumer of 
glassware may arbitrarily be raised beyond all reason."" (P. 619.)"
624,6," Illustrative of the combination's purpose in this respect is Levis' report to Owens' board of directors in November, 1929: ""Our 
negotiations with Hartford-Empire Company and others, so far as our patent situation and royalty income is [sic] concerned, 
should be to attempt to secure a position whereby we pay no royalty on any item we produce and we attempt to have all others 
pay royalty on every item they produce, we participating with any one else in the royalties they receive."""
624,7," With reference to the contention that the amendments made by the defendants in their contract relations, without the court's 
knowledge, between the filing of the complaint in 1939 and the closing of testimony over two years later, the court said: ""Men 
cannot, by illegal means, erect an illegal structure -- a structure of dominance and control over an industry vital to the welfare of 
the public -- and then, by destroying the illegal means by which the structure has been erected, take the position that they have 
reformed, that they have adopted a new course of conduct, and that they should go on their way unmolested by the law -- as 
long as the illegal structure and its adverse effects upon the public remain."" (P. 618.)"
624,8, Cf. notes 13 and 17 infra. 
625,9," Throughout the litigation the facts have been substantially undisputed in consequence of the documentary and conclusive 
character of the proofs.  Cf. note 3 supra.  The dispute has been primarily over the inferences to be drawn from the facts, the 
defendants contending, in the words of the District Court (p. 615), that ""any control that may exist over the production and 
marketing of unpatented glassware is but the result of a normal exercise of the patent privilege,"" with like contention, of course, 
concerning the production and licensing of glassmaking machinery. The contention merely poses the basic question of law in the 
case."
625,10, Cf. notes 2 and 13.
625,11," Unless, in fact, this were Corning, which since 1922 has owned, or controlled, 43 per cent of Hartford's stock. According to the 
District Court, Corning ""in practical effect had sufficient control over Hartford to dictate the policies of Hartford in accordance with 
Corning's wishes."" (P. 557.)"
625,12," Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106."
625,13," The trial court's conclusions concerning these changes, cf. text infra at note 14, may be considered in the light of the other 
evidence showing consciousness of violation, with anticipation of remedial action, cf. note 2 supra, and of practices by which 
domination obtained under patents was maintained after they had expired, e. g., Hartford's refusal to license others than Corning 
to make heat-resistant ware and oven ware on its feeders after Corning's patents on glass composition for these wares had 
expired in 1936.  (P. 556.) Cf. also Owens' continued domination of the suction field, noted in this Court's opinion, by use of 
improvement patents after its basic patent had expired. "
626,14, Cf. note 13 supra. 
627,15, Cf. note 2 supra.
627,16," Cf. the statement, in 1922, of V. M. Dorsey to A. D. Falck, of Corning: ""F. G. Smith, in private, suggested to me the most 
revolutionary theory, which he will no doubt talk to you about, viz., putting out the feeders very much like telephones are 
installed, that is, with an installation charge with a flat royalty plus royalties on production above a given amount.  I think it has 
much to be commended.  It would certainly put the pirates out of business quickly."""
627,17," Cf. note 7 supra, and the instances cited from Exhibit 76 in the District Court's opinion, 46 F.Supp. 541, 604-606, which 
caused it to raise the question why criminal prosecution had not been instituted."
627,18," Even a disposition so guarded would realize for the owner the fruit of his wrongdoing in the case of patents illegally acquired 
and integrated in the pool.  But it would terminate the continuing benefit to him and the possibility of his further misusing the 
patent to the public harm. "

635,1," There can be no question of this Court's power to review and modify terms of relief in Sherman Act suits, when they exceed the 
limits imposed by law or amount to an abuse of discretion.  As the Court's opinion indicates, this power has been frequently 
exercised, most often in the cases cited to strengthen rather than to weaken the remedy where violation has been found, United 
States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 184; United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 226 U.S. 470; United States v. Swift

Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707. In Local 167 v. United States, 291 U.S. 293, the judgment and decree were affirmed without change, 
the Court observing, at 299: ""The United States is entitled to effective relief. . . .  In framing its [the decree's] provisions doubts 
should be resolved in favor of the Government and against the conspirators."" "
636,2," It is hardly necessary to point out specifically the large difference between a finding that competition has been restored to the 
industry and one that ""a dissolution of Hartford and a distribution of its patents into various hands would create a worse situation 
than that envisaged by the District Court's decree."" "

674,8," Senator Pomerene said, 56 Cong. Rec. 173: ""It [the bill] does not repeal, it does not affect the Sherman law so far as it applies 
to domestic commerce. It strengthens the Sherman law and the Federal Trade Commission law, in so far as unfair practices are 
concerned, beyond territorial lines."" And he also said: ""this bill does not repeal the Sherman law,"" and that associations not 
remaining within the immunity granted by § 2 ""violate the law of the land."" (p. 172.) He said further that such an association 
""would be subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities of this country, including both the Federal Trade Commission and the 
Department of Justice."" (p. 170.) Congressman Webb, in discussing the amendment to § 5, said that the language of the 
provisions of § 2 ""is a perfect preservation of the Sherman law in all of its virility within the confines of this country,"" 56 Cong.

1937, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  §§ 1, 2, 3 and 4."
697,2," As more particularly described in the complaint, the 'Eastern area' includes the District of Columbia and the States of Alabama, 
Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New "

Phillips, Petroleum, Musselshell, Yellowstone, and Carbon."
698,3," Claim 1 of the patent reads as follows: 'A plasterboard comprising a body, a covering of fibrous material adhering to one face of 
the body folded to inclose an edge of the body and overlie a portion of the opposite fact thereof, and a covering of fibrous 
material for said opposite face of the body overlying said folded-over portion of the first mentioned covering but having its edge 
spaced from the edge of the board.' "
700,4," As will be noted, most of these license agreements were executed on various dates during October, 1929, and have been 
referred to throughout the record as the 'November 1929 contracts.'"
700,5," Claim 9 of the patent reads as follows: 'A light weight building material composed of a hard mass of cellular structure which 
comprises set cementitious material having permanently fixed therein foam cells that possess their original form and which are 
arranged throughout the structure in foam-like formation.'"
700,6," Claim 17 of the patent reads as follows: 'A wallboard comprising a porous body of hardened cellular cementitious material 
enclosing a plurality of voids encased in tough pliable films, and cover sheets therefor which are applied by means of pressure 
when said cementitious material is in a plastic state whereupon said cover sheets remain bonded to said cementitious material 
after the same has set and hardened.'"
700,7," Claim 2 of the patent reads as follows: 'A wallboard consisting mainly of gypsum and having a paper liner, cooked starch being 
incorporated with the gypsum in about the proportion of 2 lbs. of starch to 40 lbs. of gypsum, to insure adhesion of said paper 
liner.' "
701,8," Although Birdsey patent No. 1,358,508 for partially closed-edge gypsum board was included within the patents which were the 
basis of the USG-Universal license contract of September 17, 1926, there was apparently still outstanding at the time of the 
execution of the license contract of November 5, 1929, an in infringement claim by USG against Universal under this Birdsey 
patent. See page 2 of the license contract of November 5, 1929, Government Exhibit 6."
701,9," On January 3, 1939, USG consented to the assignment of this license to Newark. "
702,10," On January 3, 1939, USG consented to the assignment of this contract to Newark."
702,11," This contract was assigned to Celotex on April 12, 1939."
702,12," On January 3, 1939, USG granted Newark, which had merged with Kelley, a royalty free perforated lath license, at the same 
time canceling the Kelley revised license. "
703,13," There were two general classes of provisions.  The first related to prices as such and the second related to protecting the 
prices set.  The first class of provisions made an affirmative statement of the minimum price which might be charged by a 
licensee for board embodying the licensed inventions.  For this purpose the overall market was variously divided.  The basic list 
of prices was for carload shipment to dealers to set up as to divide the market territorially by the use of mill basing points, the 
delivered price to dealers being determined by taking the lowest combination of mill base price plus freight from that point to 
destination.  A standard billing weight was given per thousand square feet of different thicknesses of board.  These were for 
standard dimensions, a differential being added to the base price for odd sized products.  Special prices were stated for cut 
stock of stated thicknesses f.o.b. certain mills in named markets.  Superimposed on this basic price system were variations 
stating flat delivered prices for delimited areas, defining as single delivery points described metropolitan areas, stating special 
base prices for some thicknesses of board shipped from named base points for delivery in limited territories, providing for 
variations in price and/or allocation of charges (i.e., to dealer or shipper) for special shipments such as mixed cars, pool cars, 
and stopover cars, with territorial variations; and there were provisions for special prices for particular jobs, types of jobs, or 
types of purchasers other than dealers, e.g., contractors, prefabricated house makers, Century of Progress, and the like.  
Special discounts were provided for sales 'to other manufacturers' where permitted.  In fine, prices were varied according to the 
following factors in various combinations: style of product, amount or product, territory, form of shipment nature of use, and type 
of purchaser. The bulletins covering perforated lath were less detailed and less numerous (apparently because of the subsequent inclusion of 
the perforated board patent in the basic board license agreement) but they involved the same factors as above named. The provisions described above were substantially duplicated with respect to a separate set of prices applicable to delivery f.o.b. 
dealers' trucks at given mills or warehouses.  This type of transaction was called a 'pick-up,' and it appears that the bulletins did 
not contemplate such deliveries at any other places than at those listed or delivery of less than a stated minimum number of 
square feet.  There was no provision in the bulletins for sales to purchasers other than dealers, except for the provisions above 
referred to in respect of contractors and prefabricated house manufacturers and the like, and 'other manufacturers.' The second class of provisions, referred to above as r lated to price protection, were first in the following form: 'Allowances, Etc.: 
The minimum price fixed by licensor for patented board and/or lath shall not be reduced below such minimum price or prices by 
or through allowances, payment or rebate to customers for use of railroad siding; for switching performed after car has been 
originally set for unloading; for warehousing, trucking or unloading, or other service by them in connection with shipments or 
deliveries of patented board and/or lath. Nor shall such net cost to customer be reduced below such minimum price or prices by 
the establishment or continuance of warehouses with dealers or other buyers; or through allowance or adjustment on board 
which customer claims is of poor grade and not up to standard, except when such an allowance or adjustment on substandard 
board is first authorized by the licensor; or by allowance for any other reason whatsoever by a licensee direct or by a salesman 
of patented board out of his own compensation; or through the extension of other than regular terms to any such dealer or buyer.  
Quotations deducting the regular cash discount so that the quoted price is less than the minimum price to the licensee, are 
considered as quotations to sell at less than the minimum price and therefore in violation of the license agreement. On 
quotations to U.S. Government regular minimum delivered price less 2% of delivered price (cash discount) shall be the minimum 
price. "
704,," 'Also, where a salesman selling patented board to a customer is authorized by licensee or its agent to sell the same wholly or 
partly on a commission basis, or where a salesman not employed by licensee makes a sale of patented board to a customer on 
a commission basis and licensee or his agent accepts such sale, in either of such events the commission paid by the licensee is 
a deduction from the price at which the board is sold by licensee, and where after deducting such commission, the amount is 
less than the minimum price, licensor shall regard the sale as made at a price less than the minimum price fixed by licensor and 
a violation of the terms of the license agreement. Licensor also regards sales of patented board by commission salesmen, 
without the written consent of licensor, as a violation of the terms of the license agreement.' See pages 3-4 of Government 
Exhibit 37, a bulletin of February 24, 1937. Later another form was used, to wit: 'Rebates, Allowances, Etc. 'Any sale of patented products, though ostensibly made at or above the minimum price established by licensor, will nevertheless 
be considered a violation of the provisions of the license if licensee directly or indirectly reduces the actual price charged by 
licensee below such minimum price by granting the customer rebates, unearned or unwarranted refunds, credits or discounts, by 
reducing the price of other products, by hiring customers' trucks, by granting allowances for advertising or other purposes, by 
splitting of salesmen's compensation or commissions with customers, by overshipment of patented products, by including board 
under the guise of dunnage, or by making any other payment or allowance in the form of money or otherwise which has for its 
purpose and effect reducing the price charged by licensee below such minimum price.' See page 2 of Government Exhibit 37, a 
bulletin of February 6, 1939. "
705,14," For convenience the term 'combination' will sometimes be used in this opinion, as it is in the complaint, to refer to the alleged 
unlawful contracts, combinations, conspiracy, monopoly and attempt to monopolize. "
706,15," The licensees who executed contracts relating to metallized board and perforated lath have been named in the statement of 
facts above. "
708,16," There have been two previous related proceedings.  These were criminal indictments, both returned on June 28, 1940.  One, 
United States v. United States Gypsum Co. et al., No. 66008, in the District Court of the United States for the District of 
Columbia, charged USG, National, Certain-teed, Ebsary, Newark, and numerous officers and employees of these companies 
and of The American Gypsum Company (acquired by Celotex), with conspiring illegally to fix prices on gypsum board and to 
eliminate jobbers from the gypsum board industry; the other indictment, United States v. Certain-teed Products Corp. et al., No. 
66007, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, charged USG and Certain-teed with a conspiracy 
illegally to fix prices on perforated gypsum lath. The criminal case first described came on for trial in the fall of 1941, and on 
November 19, 1942, at the conclusion of the Government's case, a verdict was directed in favor of the defendants.  A nolle 
prosequi was filed in the second case on September 17, 1942."
708,17," Fifty-one interrogatories were served upon USG, Avery, and Knode; 53 upon National and Baker; 56 upon Certain-teed and 
Hartley; 42 upon Celotex and Dahlberg; 53 upon Ebsary and Frederick G. Ebsary; 59 upon Newark and Tomkins; 47 upon 
Texas. "
709,18," The Government's contention is phrased in the language of Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 3 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 
991, 993. This case is discussed below. "
715,19, The license agreement was Exhibit A to a stipulation of facts upon which the case was submitted. 
717,20," In a Senate debate preceding the enactment of the Sherman Act, Senator Sherman its proponent, stated: ' * * * It is the unlawful combination, tested by the rules of common law and human experience, that is aimed at by this bill, and 
not the lawful and useful combination.  Unlawful combinations made by individuals are declared by the several states to be 
against public policy and void, and in proper cases they may be punished as criminals.  If their business is lawful they can 
combine in any way and enjoy the advantage of their united skill and capital, provided they do not combine to prevent 
competition.  A limited monopoly secured by a patent right is an admitted exception, for this is the only way by which an inventor 
can be paid for his invention.' (21 Cong.Rec. 2457(1890)) "
718,," The use of the term 'limited monopoly' by Senator Sherman makes it pertinent to comment that there is a distinction between a 
patent monopoly and other monopolies granted by the Government.  A patent to land, either upon purchase from the 
Government or by virtue of satisfaction of the homestead or mining laws, grants to the patentee a right to land upon which, prior 
to the issuance of the patent, the applicant had no claim; on the contrary, it was wholly owned by the Government in trust for the 
people; such a patent moreover grants the land in perpetuity.  A patent monopoly is not only limited in time to seventeen years 
but also it grants nothing that either the Government or anyone else has theretofore owned or possessed.  It is the applicant's 
invention or discovery --  as a result of his own energy and of his ingenuity beyond the ordinary skill of the art --  of 'any new and 
useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof' (Rev. Stat. Sec. 4886 
(1875), as amended, 35 U.S.C.A.  § 31) which is the basis for the issuance of a patent. An inventor is under no legal obligation 
to disclose or to use the fruit of his thought and labor.  The patent laws, upon the theory that the public will benefit by disclosure 
and use of inventions, offer him, in consideration of disclosure, an exclusive right to make, use and vend for a period of 
seventeen years.  It is true, as stated by Mr. Justice Story in Pennock and Sellers v. Dialogue, 1829, 2 Pet. 1, 7 L.Ed. 327, that 
the promotion of the progress of science and the useful arts is the main objective of the patent laws and that the reward of 
inventors is secondary and merely a means to that end.  It is true, also, as said by Mr. Justice Daniel in Kendall v. Winsor, 1858, 
21 How. 322, 329, 16 L.Ed. 165, that 'Whilst the remuneration of genius and useful ingenuity is a duty incumbent upon the 
public, the rights and welfare of the community must be fairly dealt with and effectually guarded.  Considerations of individual 
emolument can never be permitted to operate to the injury of these.' And it is true, as said in United States v. Masonite Corp., 
supra, that this must be the point of departure for decision on the facts of anti-trust cases involving patents 'lest the limited patent 
privilege be enlarged by private agreements so as to by-pass the Sherman Act.' (316 U.S.at page 278, 62 S.Ct.at page 1078, 86 
L.Ed. 1461) But these statements do not narrow the ruling in the General Electric case.  They but put in other words the 
limitation expressed in that case --  that the terms and conditions of a patent license are not to yield to the patentee more than 
the normal and reasonable reward of a patent monopoly. "
719,21," Henry v. A. B. Dick Co. was overruled in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra, upon the ground that the 
grant of a patent to a machine is of the exclusive right to use the mechanism and produce the result with any appropriate 
material, but that such material is no part of the patented machine or of the combination which produces the patented result, and 
that therefore the owner of the patent cannot restrict use of the machine to material supplied by him.  In the General Electric 
case the Court stated that 'The overruling of the Dick case and the disapproval of the Button-Fastener case ( Heaton-Peninsular 
Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 6 Cir., 77 F. 288, 35 L.R.A. 7281, by the Motion Picture Film case did not carry 
with it the overruling of Bement (& Sons) v. (National) Harrow Company.' (272 U.S.at page 493, 47 S.Ct.at page 198, 71 L.Ed. 
362. "
721,22," This was recognized in General Electric Co. v. Laco-Philips Co., 2 Cir., 1916, 233 F. 96, where the court, speaking of the Just 
& Hanaman patent, said: 'I think the invention here in suit is of great merit, entitled to firm support, and second only to Edison's.  
Edison found a dim pathway and transformed it into an illuminated road.  Just & Hanaman have broadened that road into a 
boulevard, alive with blazing lights.' (233 F.at page 105) In General Electric Co. v. Independent Lamp & Wire Co., D.C.D.N.J. 1920, 267 F. 824, the court, speaking of the Coolidge 
patent, said: 'The ductile tungsten filament has gone into general use, and has in large measure, if not entirely, supplanted all 
other filaments, including that of Just & Hanaman, for incandescent electric lamps. It is less expensive to produce, yet it has far 
greater durability and utility than the squirted filament.  It is a commercially new product of great utility, having properties and 
characteristics unknown to the natural and normal tungsten, or, in fact, to any other material.' (267 F.at pages 828, 829) "
723,23," The Westinghouse percentage was accomplished by a license provision that the royalty should be 2% of the sales price on 
that part of the Westinghouse production which amounted to no more than 15% (later 17.25%) of the combined General Electric 
and Westinghouse sales of the patented lamps, but that the royalty should be increased to 10% on any sales of Westinghouse in 
excess of that percentage.  The license provided for a reduction of the 2% royalty to 1% after the total royalties paid by 
Westinghouse amounted to $ 800,000 (later increased to $ 945,000) or in any event at the end of 10 years; but it was 
specifically provided that under no circumstances should the 10% royalty on the excess sales of Westinghouse be decreased.  It 
is to be inferred that General Electric did not regard it necessary to reserve the right to fix the price for the manufacturers given a 
small percentage to sell in a limited field but that it thought that in the case of Westinghouse the percentage was sufficiently 
large to necessitate the reservation of the right to fix the Westinghouse price minimum in order to protect General Electric as 
licensor in its own market. "
724,24," A patent was involved in that case, but it was not upon the product (brick) on the output of which by licensees there was a 
quantity restriction.  The patent was for a brick loading machine, and use of the patent as a foundation for the license 
agreements involved was, in a broad sense, subterfuge.  This case is discussed in greater detail in topic VIII."
724,25," Annexed to the stipulation of facts in the General Electric case and made a part of such stipulation were Exhibit A, the license 
agreement of March 1, 1912, and Exhibit B, the General Electric Company's del credere agency contracts, instructions and 
schedules, and purchase contracts.  Annexed to the license agreement were a Schedule A, listing the patents on which the 
license agreement was founded, and a Schedule B, the contents of which will be referred to below.  Comprised within Exhibit A, 
the license agreement, and Schedules A and B thereto, were for following provisions (which cover pages 111 to 180 of the 
Record of 875 printed pages in the General Electric case).  It will be noted that, while not so segregated, they divide themselves 
into three general classes of provisions: general and miscellaneous provisions, including the provisions of the license agreement 
itself (Exhibit A) of some twenty numbered paragraphs; provisions for arriving at price; and provisions for protecting price. The license agreement granted to the licensee a non-exclusive license under the patents listed in Schedule A, and under 
patents which the licensor might own or control, and under patents to be issued under patent applications owned by the licensor, 
for improvements on carbon filament, metallized filament, tungsten and tantalum filament lamps, and for improvements in 
machines, appliances or processes for the manufacture of such lamps. The license agreement impliedly forbade the licensee to 
contest, during the existence of the agreement, validity of the licensor's patents. The licensee agreed to pay royalties, and the 
licensor and licensee each agreed to keep books with reference to its manufacture, sales and shipments of all electric lamps, 
and to keep its books open to the inspection of the other.  The license provided that it was granted on the express condition that 
the licensor should have the right to fix the licensee's prices, terms and conditions of sale of any tantalum, metallized carbon, or 
tungsten filament lamp which embodied any of the inventions of the patents included in the license. These terms and conditions 
were set forth in Schedule B.  The licensee agreed that it would sell lamps only in accordance with Schedule B and under the 
licensor's form of contract and in compliance with general sales rules set out in Schedule B and at prices not lower and on terms 
and conditions no more favorable to the purchaser than those set out in the Schedule.  The licensee agreed to make reports 
called for in the Schedule.  The reports included: a report within ten days on all appointments of agents showing date of 
appointment and compensation allowed; an immediate report of each purchaser's contract entered into, with the amount on 
which discounts were based; an immediate report of all sales to purchasers for immediate delivery without contract; a report 
giving the net value of all lamps sold by each agent; a report giving the net value of all lamps delivered under purchasers' 
contracts; a monthly report of all allowances, replacements and other adjustments made on account of claims for defective 
lamps, or otherwise giving the amounts of such allowances; a report of the net value of incandescent lamps of each class sold 
and invoiced. Schedule B, included, in addition to the general sales rules referred to above, forms for the appointment of B agents and A 
agents, for the purchase of incandescent lamps, instructions to manufacturers' agents, sales instructions for A agents and for B "
725,," agents, price schedules of extra charges for tipless lamps, colored lamps, changes in standard base of lamp, etching letters and 
special lamps. Schedule B also contained a list of prices of the different types of metallized carbon, tantalum and tungsten 
filament (Mazda) lamps, a discount table and instructions with respect to deliveries, freight charges and the like.  The licensee 
expressly agreed to sell lamps under the licensor's (manufacturer's) form of contract for purchase of lamps. This contract form 
covered a purchaser's estimated requirements for a year and contemplated that purchases should in no event exceed the 
purchaser's requirement of lamps for its own use during the period of the contract; required the purchaser to agree to pay for 
lamps in accordance with the rate of discount specified, and to pay transportation charges in accordance with an attached 
delivery schedule; provided for terms of 30 days with 2% discount for payment within 10 days; reserved to the manufacturer the 
right to cancel if lamps sold thereunder were used on lighting circuits other than those supplied with current by the purchaser 
exclusively, or other than those located in the building or on the property occupied, owned or leased by the purchaser.  (The 
licensee was thus restricted entirely to making sales to consumers.) The license agreement prohibited the licensee from selling in the territory of the Chicago Edison Company or the Boston Edison 
Company except to those companies. The general sales rules in Schedule B provided that lamps might be sold at contract prices only to purchasers who had executed 
the standard form of purchase contract, and to purchasers for immediate delivery without contract where the seller had definite 
knowledge that the lamps so sold were for the purchaser's own immediate use; required that all purchase contracts must be 
made on standard forms furnished or approved by the licensor; required each contract to be limited to one brand of lamp. The 
sales rules provided that prior to the acceptance of any contract information regarding the amount of purchases for which the 
contract might be made must be obtained from the licensor; provided that on lamps purchased, billed and delivered at standard 
package or higher prices within 30 days prior to the signing of a contract, contract prices might be allowed, but that lamps 
ordered before the expiration of a contract and not delivered and invoiced within 30 days after the expiration thereof, should not 
be included in the contract.  The sales rules provided that the requirements of more than one customer could not be combined 
and covered by one contract except where the lamps were ordered for use in installations owned or controlled by one 
corporation, co-partnership or individual.  The sales rules, as well as the contract form above, required that the terms of sale 
should be 2% 10 days, 30 days net; they provided that no bid for use both in foreign and domestic territory should offer any 
lower price on the lamps for foreign consumption than on those for domestic use (although the right to fix the price on lamps 
applied only th those sold for use in domestic territory).  Under the sales rules no sales or quotations were to be submitted on 
lamps covered by attached schedules in connection with any other material or lamps not covered by such schedules where the 
award of such business was based upon the combined value of the scheduled lamps and other lamps and materials; no sample 
was to be supplied free of charge; no guarantee could be made on lamps except in accordance with the 'standard 
specifications'; allowances for burned out lamps or bases were forbidden and also allowances or payments made to cover the 
cost of inspecting or testing lamps, except that factory facilities might be given without charge for the purpose of initial inspection 
or test, but not for life test.  (These provisions were obviously intended to prevent indirect price cutting by the furnishing of 
services or other things of value to the purchaser.) Under the price lists and discount schedules included in Schedule B there was a variation in prices and discounts depending 
upon the quantities purchased during a period of a year, and according to whether or not the purchase was in standard package 
quantities or in broken package quantities.  The applicable discount varied from 10% to 37% in standard package quantities and 
0% to 27% on broken package quantities depending upon whether the purchaser was in a bracket for $ 150, $ 300, $ 600, $ 
1200, $ 2500, $ 5000, $ 10,000, $ 20,000, $ 40,000, $ 80,000, or $ 150,000 in total purchases during the period of a year.  The 
license agreement placed certain restrictions upon the time within which changes might be made in the discount schedules. The delivery and freight schedule set out in Schedule B provided that all lamps might be sold or billed to purchasers f.o.b. point 
of shipment, with freight allowed on shipments consisting of not less than one standard package to all points on or east of the 
Mississippi River, to all points in the states of Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri, and to all points on the Missouri River south of 
Sioux City, Iowa; on deliveries of less than standard package quantities, it was required that the goods should be sold only f.o.b. 
the manufacturer's place of business or that of his agent, and no allowance was to be made for either freight or express; as to all 
points outside the areas above described freight was to be added to the billing price of lamps in accordance with additional 
charges shown on the schedule, which were apparently calculated by the licensor on an average freight cost basis. The license agreement obligated the licensee not to allow its agents any greater compensation than that allowed by the licensor 
to its agents; and the licensor expressly reserved the right to approve or disapprove any agent which the licensee might seek to 
appoint.  The provision in terms was this: 'It is understood that the Licensor proposes to appoint as agents, for the sale of a 
portion of its metallized filament, tungsten filament and tantalum filament lamps, persons and companies who will sell the 
Licensor's said lamps to consumers through their own salesmen.  And this license is granted only upon and is subject to the 
condition that the Licensee shall not interfere with such portion of the Licensor's business in such lamps carried on in this "
726,," manner, by offering to allow or allowing the Licensee's agents greater compensation than that allowed by the Licensor to its 
agents, as specified in said Schedule B, or by appointing as agents persons or companies of whom the Licensor affirmatively 
disapproves as being irresponsible representatives for handling metallized filament tungsten filament, and tantalum filament 
incandescent lamps covered by this license.' (G. E. Record, supra, at pages 122, 123) (This is to be compared with the 
provisions in the USG license bulletins purposed to prevent rebating on the price of patented board by the splitting of salesmen's 
commissions with customers.) The license agreement forbade the licensee's selling any parts of an incandescent lamp made under the license, as 
distinguished from a complete lamp, without the written consent of the licensor; the licensee was permitted to refill burned out 
lamps and to sell the same, but was required to guarantee that any such lamps sold by it would not be refilled. It was provided in the license agreement that if arbitrators should find that the licensee had sold at lower prices or on terms and 
conditions more favorable to the purchaser than those prescribed by the licensor, the damages for such violation of the license, 
in the absence of evidence to the contrary, should be an amount equal to the total value at the prices established under the 
agreement of the lamps involved in each transaction.  A similar provision existed in respect of damages assessed against the 
licensor for any sales made by it at prices lower or on terms and conditions more favorable to the purchaser than those 
prescribed for the licensee. The foregoing summary of the provisions of the General Electric-Westinghouse license agreement shows the restrictions placed 
upon the licensee by the license itself.  As has been pointed out above in the text, the Government contended in the General 
Electric case that the license agreement itself required Westinghouse to adopt General Electric's del credere agency method of 
distribution and therefore to be bound also by the same restrictions therein which General Electric placed upon its own agents, 
and the Court held that, assuming this to be correct, 'the result must be the same.' (272 U.S.at page 489, 47 S.Ct.at page 196, 
71 L.Ed. 362) Therefore the restrictions of the del credere agency contracts, instructions to agents and agents' compensation 
schedules, may be considered as having been held to be proper restrictions upon a licensee, although not contained in the 
provisions of the license agreement itself in the General Electric case.  The restrictions are contained in Exhibit B, above 
referred to, and may be summarized as follows: The General Electric del credere agency system divided the trade into three classes: (1) Large consumers readily reached by 
General Electric and sold directly by its own salaried employees with deliveries being made from its own factories and 
warehouses; (2) large consumers under contracts with General Electric, negotiated by agents, the deliveries being made from 
stock in the custody of the agents; (3) general consumers who were sold by agents under similar contracts.  The agents under 
the second class were called B agents and those under the third class A agents.  There were some 400 B agents of General 
Electric operating under two contracts, which specified in detail the manner in which they were to handle and distribute the 
lamps consigned to them.  These agents performed the functions formerly performed by jobbers in the industry.  The B agents 
were to recommend to General Electric efficient and reliable distributors to act as A agents.  There were some 21,000 A agents -
-  usually retail electrical supply dealers in small places.  (At the time the stipulation of facts in the General Electric case was 
entered into Westinghouse Lamp Company employed approximately 140 B agents and approximately 6100 A agents throughout 
the United States.) The A agents were authorized to make sales only to consumers for immediate delivery and to purchasers 
under written contract with the manufacturer. Lamps were consigned to the A and B agents and were sold through them in 
accordance with minute instructions and detailed requirements.  Rules for eligibility for appointment as B and A agents were 
established and standard forms of contracts to be entered into with different classes of agents were specified.  The restrictions 
and requirements with respect to agents and purchasers were complex.  The price schedules, discount schedules, agents' 
compensation schedules, forms of contracts for various types of purchasers and agents, and accompanying instructions in effect 
by January, 1925, cover 614 pages (pp. 180-794) of the printed record in the General Electric case. "
727,26," As pointed out earlier in this topic II, the Court in the General Electric case said, in respect of the Bement case: 'A combination 
of manufacturers owning a patent to make float spring tool harrows, licensed others to make and sell the products under the 
patent, on condition that they would not during the continuance of the license sell the products at a less price, or on more 
favorable terms of payment and delivery to purchasers, than were set forth in a schedule made part of the license. That was held 
to be a valid use of the patent rights of the owners of the patent. . . . ' (Italics supplied) (272 U.S.at pages 490, 491, 47 S.Ct.at 
page 197, 71 L.Ed. 362.)"
727,27," ' . . .  The Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company in negotiating and executing said license acted in entire good 
faith, and witnesses called on its behalf would testify (and this shall be regarded as testimony given in this case) that in the 
negotiation of said contract it dealt with the General Electric Company at arm's length and secured the most favorable terms that 
it was able to negotiate after protracted discussions covering a period of many months, and believed and still believes that the 
license finally obtained was reasonable and fair and entirely lawful in every respect.' (G. E. Record, supra, at page 105) "
728,28," It has been pointed out earlier in this topic that the General Electric plan of distribution which, had it been a requirement of the 
General Electric-Westinghouse license, would not, the Court said, have changed the result in the case, 'was of course devised 
for the purpose of enabling the company to deal directly with consumers and purchasers, and doubtless was intended to avoid 
selling the lamps owned by the company to jobbers or dealers, and prevent sale by these middle men to consumers at different 
and competing prices.  . . . ' (272 U.S.at page 483, 47 S.Ct.at page 194, 71 L.Ed. 362.) "
732,29," '35.  Deny each and all of the averments contained in Paragraph 46 of the Complaint and, further answering, these defendants 
aver that through extensive research work carried on by the expenditure each year of substantial sums of money, the defendant, 
United States Gypsum Company, developed extensive improvements in the art of manufacturing gypsum products and in the 
character and quality of such products and acquired and now owns numerous United States Letters Patent covering its 
inventions and improvements embodied in said gypsum products and in their manufacture, particularly with regard to gypsum 
board. Further answering, these defendants aver that, in accordance with the patent laws of the United States, the defendant, 
United States Gypsum Company, acquired a legal monopoly in the manufacture sale and use of such gypsum products 
embodying the inventions and improvements set forth and claimed in its said patents and that, after due deliberation, said 
defendant determined to share its said monopoly with other manufacturers of gypsum board through the granting of licenses to 
manufacture and sell gypsum board embodying the inventions and improvements set forth and claimed in said defendant's 
patents, to the end that the gypsum industry and the public generally might benefit through the production and enjoyment of a 
superior product they could not otherwise have produced or had, and, as a condition in said licenses and for the reasonable and 
appropriate protection of the patent rights which it had acquired, the defendant, United States Gypsum Company, reserved the 
right to establish the minimum prices at which its licensees might sell the patented products so manufactured by them, pursuant 
to the terms of the license agreement. These defendants further aver that the right so reserved to defendant, United States 
Gypsum Company, was designed to and did protect said defendant's patent rights and was an entirely proper and legal 
restriction within the purview of the patent laws and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States; that the said 
license agreements involved basic patents in the manufacture of gypsum board and were, in law and in fact, bona fide license 
agreements, reasonably designed to secure to the defendant, United States Gypsum Company, the pecuniary reward for its 
valid patent monopolies to which it was entitled.'"
732,30," These are the paragraphs of the complaint which allege the execution by USG and Certain-teed of the May 1929, November 
1929, metallized board, and perforated lath license agreements. "
737,31," Dickson v. Uhlmann Grain Co., discussed above, is here cited."
737,32," In aid of a more generalized argument on burden of proof the Government cites United States v. Eastman Kodak Co., 
D.C.W.D.N.Y. 1915, 226 F. 62, appeal dismissed 1921, 255 U.S. 578, 41 S.Ct. 321, 65 L.Ed. 795, and United States v. United 
States Steel Corp., D.C.D.N.J. 1915, 223 F. 55, affirmed 1920, 251 U.S. 417, 40 S.Ct. 293, 64 L.Ed. 343, 8 A.L.R. 1121. In the 
first of those cases it was undisputed that the Eastman Kodak Company controlled from 75 to 80% of the entire interstate trade 
in cameras, film, plates and photographic paper, and had accordingly secured a monopoly. District Judge Hazel held that under 
these circumstances the burden rested upon the defendants to prove that this was accomplished by lawful methods --  normal 
processes of growth, mere acquisition of property, or superior merit of products.  In United States v. United States Steel Corp., 
Circuit Judge Buffington, speaking for the District Court, ruled that the vast size of the Steel Corporation, the influence and 
control incident to such size, and the seeming power of the Corporation to crush and its ability to absorb business through its 
systemized organization, were all factors so associated with monopoly to restrain trade and crush out competition 'that we may 
say that, standing alone as a mere insolated fact, this great company gives one such an impression of monopoly that we feel we 
may in this inquiry place the burden upon it and its formers to satisfy us by affirmative proof that monopoly was not the purpose 
for which it was formed, but that it was the normal regular, and natural outcome of the improvement in steel making, and its 
concentrated powers were only such as were deemed to be necessary to successful producing and marketing its product.' (233 
F.at page 121) But when the Steel Corporation case reached the United States Supreme Court, that tribunal ruled that 'we must 
adhere to the law and the law does not make mere size an offense or the existence of unexerted power an offense.' (251 U.S.at 
page 451, 40 S.Ct.at page 299, 64 L.Ed. 343, 8 A.L.R. 1121) In United States v. International Harvester Co., 1927, 274 U.S. 
693, 708, 47 S.Ct. 748, 753, 71 L.Ed. 1302, the Supreme Court rules that 'The law, however, does not make the mere size of a 
corporation, however impressive, or the existence of unexerted power on its part, an offense, when unaccompanied by unlawful 
conduct in the exercise of its powers.  United States v. United States Steel Corporation, 251 U.S. 417, 451 (40 S.Ct. 293, 64 
L.Ed. 343, 8 A.L.R. 1121).' Again in United States v. Swift & Co., 1932, 286 U.S. 106, 116, 52 S.Ct. 460, 463, 76 L.Ed. 999, the 
Court said 'Mere size, according to the holding of this court, is not an offense against the Sherman Act unless magnified to the 
point at which it amounts to a monopoly ( United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417 (40 S.Ct. 293, 64 L.Ed. 343, 
8 A.L.R. 1121); United States v. International Harvester Co., 274 U.S. 693, 708 (47 S.Ct. 748, 71 L.Ed. 1302)), but size carries 
with it an opportunity for abuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is proved to have been utilized in the past.' "
742,33," The Van Riper case, above cited, contains a good statement of the rule concerning the admissibility of declarations in 
conspiracy cases: 'Such declarations are admitted upon no doctrine of the law of evidence, but of the substantive law of crime.  
When men enter into an agreement for an unlawful end, they become ad hoc agents for one another, and have made 'a 
partnership in crime.' What one does pursuant to their common purpose, all do, and, as declarations may be such acts, they are 
competent against all.  Hitchmen C. & C. Co. v. Mitchell, 245 U.S. 229, 249, 38 S.Ct. 65, 62 L.Ed. 260, L.R.A. 1918C, 497, 
Ann.Cas. 1918B, 461; Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, 188 U.S. 208, 23 S.Ct. 294, 47 L.Ed. 446. For this reason, merely 
narrative declarations are not competent.  But it is also a part of the law of joint crimes that, when a party joins an existing group 
already so engaged, he assumes responsibility for all that has been done theretofore.  Anonymous, 6 Mod. 43; People v. 
Mather, 4 Wend. (N.Y.) 229, 258, 259, 260, 21 Am.Dec. 122; Com. v. Rogers, 181 Mass. 184, 194, 63 N.E. 421; 1 Russell on 
Crimes (8th Ed.) 190; 1 Bishop, New Criminal Law, Sec. 642.  For this reason all that was done before he entered may be used 
against him, but obviously not what was done after he left, Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 309, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 
429; Brown v. United States, 150 U.S. 93, 14 S.Ct. 37, 37 L.Ed. 1010.' (13 F.2d at page 967) "

747,35," In that case it is pointed out that the process which a court or a commission properly follows in reaching a decision on the facts 
includes four parts: (1) Evidence must be taken and weighted both as to its accuracy and as to its credibility; (2) from 
consideration of this evidence a determination of facts of a basic or underlying nature must be reached; (3) from these basic 
facts the ultimate facts, usually in the language of an applicable statute or principle of law, are to be inferred, or not, as the case 
may be; (4) from this finding the decision will follow on the application of the statutory or judicially enunciated criterion. "
753,36," Since the only exhibits in evidence are Government exhibits they will for convenience be referred to hereafter merely as 
Exhibit . . ., rather than as Government Exhibit . . . . "
756,37," On May 1, 1937, Newark purchased the stock of Kelley.  On June 23, 1937, Kelley executed its perforated lath license 
agreement with USG.  On January 3, 1939, Newark merged with Kelley.  On the same date USG granted Newark a perforated 
lath license, at the same time canceling the previous perforated lath license granted Kelley. "
762,38," The provision in full is: '2.  The licensee further agrees to pay to the Licensor for the right, license and privilege of 
manufacturing, using and/or selling plasterboard or gypsum wallboard, and for the privilege of using the processes and making 
and using the machines and/or inventions embodying the inventions set forth and claimed in said Utzman Patents and in any 
and all of said patents and applications for letters patent described in Exhibit A, an amount (hereinafter for convenience referred 
to as a license fee or royalty) equivalent to five per cent (5%) of the selling price of the Licensee of all plasterboard or gypsum 
wallboard of every kind, whether patented or unpatented, manufactured and sold by Licensee between the date hereof and 
August 6, 1929, the date of the expiration of said Utzman Patent Number 1,034,746, and thereafter an amount equivalent to one 
and one-half per cent (1 1/2%) of the selling price of the Licensee of all such plasterboard or gypsum wallboard from August 6, 
1929, until February 10, 1937, the date of the expiration of said Patent Number 1,330,413.' This is the language of the Ebsary license of May 22, 1929, Exhibit 5.  The provisions of the Texas license of April 11, 1927, 
Exhibit 599, and of the Certain-teed license of May 22, 1929, Exhibit 4, are similar. "
763,39," In the record the 'whereas clauses' above mentioned were incorrectly referred to as the third and fourth rather than the fifth 
and sixth.  This was because what was shown the witness during the examination was page 48 of the complaint on which four 
'whereas clauses' appeared.  But there were two previous 'whereas clauses' on page 47.  The Ebsary agreement of May 22, 
1929, is printed in the complaint at pages 4757 inclusive. "
764,40," This letter (a declaration binding only upon Atlantic) refers to the undesirability of selling seconds in certain markets, to the 
restriction of sales of seconds to such territory as might absorb them with the least disturbance to the trade in general, and to the 
policy of Atlantic to sell as few seconds anywhere as possible.  The letter refers also to the need of each wallboard manufacturer 
for some outlet for No. 2 board, stating that this is logical in territory fairly near the plant since this reduced price commodity 
cannot bear much freight."
764,41," The license provision was as follows: '9.  The licensee and the Licensor each expressly covenants and agrees that all of said 
patented product sold by it and commonly known in the trade as 'seconds' shall be plainly invoiced as seconds and shall be 
plainly marked with a visible red stamp or label firmly fixed on each of said board showing the word 'seconds' in letters at least 
three inches in height.' (Exhibit 3, paragraph 9)n.40 This letter (a declaration binding only upon Atlantic) refers to the 
undesirability of selling seconds in certain markets, to the restriction of sales of seconds to such territory as might absorb them 
with the least disturbance to the trade in general, and to the policy of Atlantic to sell as few seconds anywhere as possible.  The 
letter refers also to the need of each wallboard manufacturer for some outlet for No. 2 board, stating that this is logical in territory 
fairly near the plant since this reduced price commodity cannot bear much freight."
764,42," The restrictive provision was: 'It is expressly understood that licensee in its business of manufacturing and selling plasterboard 
and/or gypsum wallboard will use only said bundle set forth and claimed in said Patent Number 1,696,877 and will not use any 
other bundle or method of bundling plasterboard during the term of said license.' This is the language of the Ebsary agreement 
of May 22, 1929 (Exhibit 5). "
765,43," This is the language of the Ebsary agreement of May 22, 1929 (Exhibit 5)."
765,44," This is the language of the Ebsary agreement of October 18, 1929 (Exhibit 11). "
766,45," The miscellaneous gypsum products referred to in the complaint, as specified by the bill of particulars, are gypsum block, 
gypsum tile, and Keene's cement. "
769,46," The bill of particulars lists as manufacturing distributors, in addition to those named in the text, the American Cyanamid & 
Chemical Corporation, of New York, N.Y.; The Calvin Tomkins Company, of New York, N.Y.; the Grand Rapids Plaster 
Company, of Grand Rapids, Michigan; the Michigan Gypsum Company, of Grand Rapids, Michigan; The Alabastine Company, 
of Grand Rapids, Michigan; and the Wasem Plaster Company, of Fort Dodge, Iowa.  No evidence was introduced concerning 
those companies. "
771,47," The bulletins referred to are Exhibits 404 of May 23, 1929; 410 of June 7, 1929; 411 of June 19, 1929; 413 of June 26, 1929; 
and 414 of July 9, 1929.  (The exhibits are declarations binding only upon USG.) These bulletins show that: On May 23, 1929 
(Exhibit 404), the price of 3/8' #1 Grade (standard) wallboard f.o.b. Oakfield, New York; Gypsum Ohio; Plasterco, Virginia; Grand 
Rapids, Michigan; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Southard, Oklahoma; Sweetwater, Texas; and Acme, Texas, was $ 20 per M sq. ft.; of #2 
Grade wallboard of the same dimension, $ 17.50 per M sq. ft.; and of seconds of the same dimension $ 15 per M sq. ft.  On 
June 7, 1929 (Exhibit 410), the price of #2 board for the same dimension and basing points was raised to $ 18.75, and the price 
of seconds to $ 16.25, per M sq. ft., no change being made in the price of standard board.  These same prices were continued 
by the bulletin of June 19, 1929 (Exhibit 411).  On June 26, 1929 (Exhibit 413), #2 board was priced at $ 20, the same as the 
standard board; and seconds were priced at $ 17.50.  On July 9, 1929 (Exhibit 414), standard board went to $ 22.50, seconds 
remained at $ 20, and no mention was made of #2 board, the same remaining therefore at the previous figure of $ 20 per M sq. 
ft. On May 23, 1929 (Exhibit 404), the price of 3/8' #1 Grade (standard) wallboard, based on New Brighton, New York, was $ 22.60 
per M sq. ft.; of #2 Grade of the same dimension, $ 20.10 per M sq. ft.; and of seconds of the same dimension, $ 17.60 per M 
sq. ft.  On June 7, 1929 (Exhibit 410), the #2 board was raised to $ 21.35 per M sq. ft.; the seconds to $ 1885; and, no change 
being made in the standard board price, it thus remained at $ 22.60.  On June 19, 1929 (Exhibit 411), no price change was 
made for the New Brighton, New York, basing point, and prices therefore remained the same on standard, #2 board, and 
seconds.  On June 26, 1929 (Exhibit 413), the New Brighton price for 3/8' #2 board was changed from $ 21.35 per M sq. ft. to $ 
22.60; and the seconds from $ 18.85 to $ 20.10; no change was indicated in the standard board.  On July 9, 1929 (Exhibit 414), 
the 3/8' standard board based on New Brighton was priced at $ 25.10 per M sq. ft., the seconds at $ 22.60; no change in price of 
#2 board being indicated, that remained at $ 22.60. The foregoing figures are given as illustrative.  The bulletins refer also to prices f.o.b. other basing points."
771,48," This memorandum (a declaration binding only upon Certain-teed) states that the writer is endeavoring to work out a seconds 
policy with USG. "
773,49," The body of this letter reads as follows: 'We are advised that your company has recently sold wallboard and/or plasterboard embodying the claims and inventions of the 
patents under which you are licensed to Wallace & Herring, Alexandria, Virginia at prices below the licensor's minimum price to 
you for such board in such market. 'Specifically, that you did sell this firm a mixed carload of plaster and patented board and did not invoice or charge to this firm a 
certain amount of plaster, and this was also handled so as to reflect to the said Wallace & Herring, Alexandria, Virginia a rebate 
on the patented board they purchased from you. 'Please advise in detail as to your sales of patented board to this firm, and specifically advise us of any donations or credits 
made in conjunction with your sales of said board.'"
773,50, The body of this letter reads thus: 
774,," 'Referring to your letter of March 31st with reference to Wallace & Herring, Alexandria, Virginia, we wish to advise that we have 
secured from them in every case the full Bulletin price for wallboard or plasterboard under the License Agreement. 'Whatever sales of plasterboard have been made to this firm have been made at the prevailing price and no special price made 
to induce board business.' "
777,51," The full test of the telegram is: 'Lee Story and Companys man in Brooklyn is quoting on Kelly (sic) board up to two dollars per 
thousand below license bulletin prices to lumber dealers in New York City You must investigate and correct this immediately as 
we look to you for protection under our contract Lee Story must be eliminated immediately as a jobber Wire us full information at 
once tonight.' "
778,52," The Government asserts that the evidence shows that the reason for USG'S refusal to give its consent to Ebsary to sell the 
Cardiff Gypsum Company was that Cardiff was known as a price cutter on plaster. But the evidence concerning refusal to grant 
the Ebsary request was received solely on the issue of whether the defendants were attempting to control the prices of plaster. "
781,53," Kelley's explanation, although it names Oakfield as the customer involved, is made in terms of Paragon Plaster & Supply Co.  
The evidence shows that that company, the Paragon Plaster Company, and the American Hardwall Plaster Company were the 
sole owners of Oakfield, that Oakfield was the plaster producing company for them, and that it stocked plasterboard and lath for 
mixed car shipments for those companies."
781,54," The exhibits are listed in chronological, rather than numerical, order. "
784,55," This evidence is discussed on pages 9 to 46 in the Government's Memorandum filed May 5, 1944, in opposition to the motions 
now under consideration. "
786,56," It is, indeed, doubtful that the Government even contends that this additional evidence proves lack of bona fides in the 
licenses or operations beyond the proper limits of the patent monopoly. Throughout the introduction of evidence and the oral 
argument, in which emphasis was placed by the Government on the charge of lack of bona fides in the licenses, they were 
variously referred to as 'sham,' 'subterfuge,' 'coverup,' 'not bona fide.' In the Government's briefs filed in opposition to the present 
motions there is little on this subject or in these terms, and in that part of the memorandum which aggregates the additional 
evidence now under discussion (pages 9 to 46 of the Government's Memorandum of May 5, 1944) there is nothing; and nothing 
concerning operations beyond the proper limits of the patent monopoly. "
787,57," It is common knowledge that there are numerous national trade associations which agree upon and carry out plans for 
industry betterment without coming within the condemnation of the Sherman Act. "

800,5," The insecticides in suit are mainly directed at the musca domestica.  Within ten weeks the house fly lays about five batches of 
eggs, 100 eggs in a batch.  Within three weeks, hatching takes place and each new female deposits hundreds of eggs.  
Calculations show that between April and September, if all hatched flies live, the progeny of a single female fly would be 
approximately 6,000,000,000,000. "
801,6," Research carried on by defendant between 1930 and 1938 in order to make its insecticides free of all odor and irritation and 
the work done by defendant's Dr. Hester, which resulted in the issuance of the Hester patent No. 2,220,521, are irrelevant 
matters, for Heckert's invention must be tested as of 1931, not 1938.  In order to test the validity of a patent its contribution to the 
art must be tested as of the day of its birth, not a decade later, or long after the art has advanced.  Standing here, in 1946, we 
are required to look back at Heckert working in 1929-30.  Practically everything we take for granted today at one time was a 
problem, in many cases a problem that was thought to be insoluble.  In short, in determining the validity of Heckert's patent, we 
can not play the role of a Monday morning quarterback. "

United States of America, its territories and possessions of brazing solders embodying the invention covered by said Letters 
Patent and so long as such brazing solders continue to be covered by said patent, shall be no more favorable to the customer 
than those which from time to time Westinghouse establishes and maintains for its own sales of similar or competing brazing 
solders under such patent to such or other similarly situated customer purchasing in like quantities.  MacGregor shall be notified 
of all such prices, terms and conditions of sale fixed by Westinghouse. ""The prices, terms and conditions of sale of Westinghouse may be changed by Westinghouse from time to time, notice being 
given MacGregor, but not less than five days' notice shall be given before any such change shall go into effect. ""6. It is agreed that it shall be regarded as an evasion of this agreement amounting to a breach thereof for MacGregor to reduce 
Westinghouse's sale price or alter Westinghouse's selling terms and conditions of sale directly or indirectly either through its own 
organization, its agents or others by any device, subterfuge or evasion or by any means whatever or to make the prices lower or 
the terms or conditions more favorable than those set forth by Westinghouse."""
813,2," Copper, phosphorus and tin solder is Patent No. 2,125,680; copper, phosphorus and silver solder is Patent No. 2,162,627. "
814,3," The agreement to fix prices, if unlawful at all, was so whether it was executed or not.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810. But this agreement by MacGregor to sell at fixed 
prices was no mere token, for the trial court found that on July 11, 1940, Westinghouse called MacGregor's attention to his 
obligation to observe user and distributor prices, and that on October 23, 1940, Westinghouse, through one of its attorneys, 
wrote MacGregor's attorney that ""if MacGregor sells direct to the user, he should conform to the user prices established, and 
when he sells direct to the dealer, he should conform to the dealer prices established."" The oral testimony of Westinghouse's 
representatives construed the contract as requiring MacGregor to maintain the prices.  Moreover, the record before us shows 
that MacGregor positively testified that he had maintained the Westinghouse prices on the copper-phosphorus combination 
because he considered himself bound to do so under the license contract."
814,4," Since the case is to be remanded for trial of the validity of the patent, we find it unnecessary to consider the propriety in any 
event of indulging a presumption of validity in favor of Westinghouse's patent without giving a presumption of a patentable 
difference to those of MacGregor.  See Miller v. Eagle Manufacturing Co., 151 U.S. 186, 208. "

816,4," ""In the instant case the court has not been requested either directly or indirectly to require MacGregor to maintain 
Westinghouse prices.  By his own testimony he has not maintained them.  The price-fixing clause is not in issue.  It is raised 
merely as a defense to a suit for accounting and payment of accrued royalties."" Discussion of findings by trial court in the 
MacGregor case. As to the Katzinger case the District Court opinion found that ""no price fixing by the respondent has been proved by the 
petitioner. . . .  At no time did the respondent attempt to carry it out and the respondent was at all times willing to have same 
removed from the contract."" Further, a specific finding of fact was that ""Respondent was always willing to eliminate the price 
fixing provisions of the license agreement, and these provisions terminated ipso facto upon termination of the license by 
petitioner."" It was on the basis of the facts so found by the District Court that the Circuit Court of Appeals held, when the 
estoppel issue was before it, that the mere presence of a price-fixing clause in the licensing agreement, whatever its setting and 
however inoperative, precluded estoppel against the licensee. 139 F.2d 291. With the estoppel issue thus eliminated, the case "
817,," was returned to the District Court to pass on the validity of the patent. Inasmuch as the Circuit Court of Appeals had found that 
the District Court had erred in its decree enforcing estoppel, the previous findings regarding estoppel became irrelevant and fell 
with the reversed decree. These findings, however, did not cease to be part of the record before the Circuit Court of Appeals on 
the first appeal.  It is that decision, with the record on which it is based, that is now before us.  If the Circuit Court of Appeals had 
enforced estoppel, the decree of the District Court and the findings on which it is based would not have been vacated.  The 
findings that were before the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal are now before us on review of that court's decision. The license agreement provided for royalties based on a percentage of the net sales.  The amount of the net sales was not fixed 
by agreement except insofar as certain scheduled articles called for a minimum price.  The record does not show the prices at 
which the sales were made.  Not only that, the claim of the licensee was that the articles for which royalties were claimed were 
outside the license. Plainly such articles were not included on the minimum price schedule and could not have been sold 
according to the scheduled price list.  The claim for royalties, therefore, was not a claim for royalties at fixed prices."
817,5," Upon full consideration the principle of the Bement case was reaffirmed and applied in United States v. General Electric Co., 
272 U.S. 476. The latter case in turn was cited with approval in Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., 283 U.S. 27, 31. It is 
relevant to note that Mr. Justice Brandeis joined in the General Electric opinion and himself wrote the Carbice opinion.  No 
member of this Court has been more resourcefully alert to protect the public interest from undue extension of the patent 
monopoly while at the same time observing the rights which Congress has seen fit to confer by the patent grant. "
818,6," The considerations that determine the granting of a license on payment of royalties are distinct from those that underlie an 
additional clause for price-fixing. They are not interdependent in fact and were not so treated by the parties; no artificial notion 
regarding consideration requires that they be treated as interdependent.  On lesser considerations of policy than have guided 
the course of patent law, this Court has refused to treat separate provisions of a contract as integrated.  See Philadelphia, 
Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad Co. v. Howard, 13 How. 307, 339; Pollak v. Brush Electric Association, 128 U.S. 446, 455."
818,7," Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Co., 326 U.S. 249, went on the ground that an earlier expired patent had put the device in 
question into the public domain. "
825,1," The relevant portions of this provision read as follows: ""If the Licensee shall discover or invent an improvement which is applicable to the Transwrap Packaging Machine and suitable 
for use in connection therewith and applicable to the making and closing of the package, but not to the filling nor to the contents 
of the package, it shall submit the same to the Licensor, which may, at its option, apply for Letters Patent covering the same.  In 
the event of the failure of the Licensor so to apply for Letters Patent covering such additional improvements, inventions or 
patentable ideas, the Licensee may apply for the same.  In the event that such additional Letters Patent are applied for and are 
granted to the Licensor, they shall be deemed covered by the terms of this License Agreement and may be used by the 
Licensee hereunder without any further consideration, license fee or royalty as above provided.  In the event that any such 
additional improvements are patented by the Licensee for use in connection with Transwrap Packaging Machines, (after the 
refusal or failure of the Licensor to apply for Patents thereon), the Licensor may, nevertheless, have the use but not the 
exclusive use of the same outside of the several territories covered by this License Agreement. The expenses of obtaining any 
such Patents shall be paid by the party applying therefor."" By another provision of the agreement, likewise challenged, it was provided that during the term of the license all improvement 
patents, whether secured by petitioner or by respondent, were to be included in the terms of the license without payment of an 
additional royalty. The petitioner, however, was to have the right to use and license the use of any such improvements outside 
the territories covered by the agreement."
825,2," Petitioner joined issue and filed a counterclaim asking that the improvement patents be assigned, that the agreement be held 
terminated and that respondent be enjoined from using the original or improvement patents. The District Court dismissed the 
complaint, declared the agreement terminated, and ordered respondent to assign the petitioner the improvement patents. The 
Circuit Court of Appeals, on reversing, held not only that the provision for the assignment of the improvement patents was 
unlawful but also that petitioner was excused from any further performance because respondent had repudiated its agreement to 
assign those patents. It remanded the cause to the District Court to determine whether petitioner was entitled to restitution. "

862,1," Though defendant does not make the argument, it would seem possible to contend that, under this extensive definition, 
plaintiffs became enemy nationals after the outbreak of war, since their concealment of I.G. assets continued thereafter.  Such 
an argument would not require restricting the scope of Sec. 9(a)."
862,2," Notwithstanding some interpretation of this case as full support for the Custodian's position, ef.  56 Yale L.J. 1068, it does not 
go so far; for only at issue was the question whether a claimant had some remedy in some court, thus making unjustified the 
refusal of a corporation to transfer stock on its books to the Custodian. "
870,3," In fact, there seems good ground for the contention that this misrepresentation, legally considered, was yet more extensive. 
Specifically, under Sec. 5, subd.  E(ii), of Exec. Order 8785, supra, Jasco itself could be viewed as a foreign national, in view of 
the substantial ownership- much more than the 25% referred to later in the regulation- of its stock by an enemy. But the 
Custodian has not taken this position as to Jasco in his vesting order.  Nor has his counsel done so in this case, either on this 
issue or on the right to sue- possibly because, inter alia, the substantial results of the action would apparently not be greatly, if at 
all, affected. "

872,2," This Article also provides that the licenses should be granted by S.I.G. 'only in consideration of substantial royalties payable to 
it and upon a fair, and as nearly as may be, a uniform basis * * * '"
872,3," Note the reference to Article IV-A as stating 'conditions * * * imposed upon S.I.G.' It is suggested that Article V deals solely with patent rights for the hydrogenation process which, in Article I, is defined as a 
'specific class of processes lying within the hydrocarbon field.' I think such an interpretation of Article V incorrect.  It cites patent 
rights for this specific class merely by way of 'example.' A reading of Article V as a whole make this apparent, I think. Article V in 
its entirety is as follows: 'Departures from Article III and IV.  Standard may refrain from making the assignment to S.I.G. as provided in Art. III and S.I.G. 
may depart from the proposed licensing plan of Art. IV so long as the result as far as the interests of I.G. are concerned, shall be 
the same as though the said assignment was made and the proposed plan followed and so long as the result contemplated by 
Arts. III and IV is effected.  For example, S.I.G. may grant to another corporation for a consideration, the patent rights for the "
873,," hydrogenation process in the United States, and to a third corporation, for a consideration, the patent rights for the 
hydrogenation process outside of the United States.  These corporations shall not be empowered to engage in manufacturing 
operations, and shall be obliged to conduct the licensing of the patent rights conveyed to them under conditions the same as 
those imposed upon S.I.G. under Art. IV-a hereof.  S.I.G. shall not be obligated to account to I.G. for the considerations received 
for such grants but shall pay over the entire considerations so received to Standard Oil Company of New Jersey after deductions 
for its own account as provided in Art. IV-B, b & c.  But S.I.G. shall be obligated to provide that I.G. receives an account of all 
royalty payments including cash, free shares or other consideration, received by said corporations from the licensees the 
compensation provided in Art. IV-A hereof to the same extent as if those licensees were licensed directly by S.I.G.' It is also suggested that Article IX authorizes S.I.G. to assign any of the patents outright to Standard or I.G.  But Article IX relates 
solely to 'patent rights hereafter purchased by Standard or I.G. from others,' and not transferred to S.I.G.  Article IX reads as 
follows: 'Purchased Patent Rights.  All assignments and grants of patent rights which are herein made or agreed to be made by 
Standard or I.G. to S.I.G. are subject to the following provisions, in so far as they relate to patent rights hereafter purchased by 
Standard or I.G. from others: If such patent rights are offered for purchase to Standard or I.G. the one to which the offer is made 
shall, if the matter appears to be important to the other, and it shall be practicable to do so, seek the cooperation of the other in 
making such purchase, with such fair distribution of the total expense as may be then agreed upon.  The refusal of the other to 
cooperate in and share the expense of any such acquisition shall release the acquired patent right in every way from the 
operation of this agreement, but the patent right may be brought under this agreement, to the extent that acquiring party still 
holds the same, at any time upon payment by the other of its equitable share of the purchase price.' It is further suggested that Article XII authorizes S.I.G. to assign the Agreement itself.  But that Article (which must be read in the 
light of the rest of the Agreement) is as follows: 'Assignment of Agreement.  Any party may assign the whole or any part of the rights and benefits accruing to it under this 
agreement, with or without assignment of those obligations which are not personal and inseparable from the business of the 
respective parties.  Any assignment of obligations by one party shall, however, not be effective as regards the responsibility of 
the assigning party to the parties in respect thereto.' Another such suggestion rests on Article XVII, which reads as follows: 'Duration of Agreement. 'A. This agreement shall be effective Nov. 9th, 1929, and shall remain in force until terminated by two years written notice served 
by any party upon the others but no such notice shall be served prior to December 31, 1945. 'B. All patent rights, including licenses (save those covered in paragraph D hereof), which are or may be assigned or granted by 
any party to another by or in accordance with this agreement shall continue to be held and enjoyed by the party so acquiring 
them until the expiration of the respective patents, even though this agreement shall have earlier terminated, but no party shall 
be obligated to give to any other any technical assistance or experience with relation to surviving patent rights after the 
expiration of this agreement. 'C. Neither Standard nor S.I.G. shall be obligated to make any payments to I.G. except as covered in paragraph D hereof, after 
the termination of this agreement, save for and on account of licensing revenue coming within this agreement and accruing 
before its termination, but I.G. shall continue to hold and enjoy its participation in any compensation paid for accruing before the 
termination of this agreement, even though such payment shall cover in part rights obtained by the licensee enduring beyond the 
term of this agreement. 'D. Excepted from the provisions of paragraphs B and C of this Article, shall be patent rights of I.G. relating to the hydrocarbon 
field but not to the hydrogenation process and acquired by I.G. subsequent to December 31, 1941.  These excepted patent 
rights may, before the expiration of this agreement, be licensed by S.I.G. to others for the full term of the patents in question, but 
S.I.G. shall be obligated to account to I.G. as provided in Art. IV hereof in respect to any revenues received from such licenses 
for the full term thereof, notwithstanding the same may extend beyond the life of this agreement. 'E. Effective as of the date of termination of this agreement S.I.G. shall reassign to I.G. all patent rights coming within Paragraph 
D, subject to such licenses as may theretofore have been granted thereunder.  As to such licenses, this reassignment shall not 
affect the obligation of the licensee or the participation of the parties in the royalties to be paid.' It is suggested that paragraph B gives S.I.G., after the termination of the agreement, the right to pass outright title (subject to 
existing licenses) to any of the patents (other than those within D) for the then unexpired life of such patent. I do not so construe 
B.  Reading it in connection with C, D. and E, and in the light of Articles IV-A and V, I think it merely cuts off the right of I.G. to "
874,," 'licensing revenue' accruing after the termination of the agreement.  But even if B is construed as suggested, the right thereby 
conferred is of very narrow scope; for the agreement could not be terminated, at the earliest, until December 1, 1947, by which 
date the life of many of the patents would have been over or of brief duration."
874,4, Except perhaps (as indicated in note 3) the narrow right to transfer outright patents unexpired when the agreement terminated.
874,5," As this question was not discussed by the parties and is not here involved, it need not here be answered. I note in passing that here the $ 35,000,000 cannot be said to have been paid solely for title to the Class A patents and the rights 
under the Class B patents; for Standard received 80% of the royalties and other immensely valuable intangibles. "
875,6," It might conceivably be argued that S.I.G. owns the title but defendant, as successor to I.G., has the right to an injunction 
against S.I.G., should the latter attempt to violate the conditions imposed by Articles IV-A and V.  However, I think that, under the 
authorities above cited, the facts which would justify such an injunction prevent passage of title: When a court will enjoin the use 
of a substantial part of the 'bundle of rights,' it is difficult to deny that the transferor has parted with 'substantially less than the 
entire 'bundle' * * * .' Rohmer v. Commissioner, supra. At best, S.I.G., as to a most important part of the 'bundle,' acquired a bare 
legal title, which is far less than that which the trial judge allotted to it. "
881,1," Griffith Amusement Co., Consolidated Theatres, Inc., R. E. Griffith Theatres, Inc., Westex Theatres, Inc., H. J. Griffith, and L. C. 
Griffith.  R. E. Griffith, a brother of H. J. and L. C. Griffith, was a defendant, but died while the suit was pending in the District 
Court and the action was not revived against his estate or personal representative."
881,2," The circuit includes the four corporate appellees and their affiliated exhibitors. When less than the full ownership of a theatre 
was acquired, the contract would provide that the buying and booking of films was exclusively in the hands of the Griffith 
interests. "
882,3," The agreement negotiated by the common agent would be executed between a distributor and each of the corporate appellees 
or between a distributor and an individual exhibitor."
882,4," There were a few franchise agreements covering films to be released by a distributor during a term of years, usually for three 
years and in one instance for five years. The theatres of appellees in Oklahoma City were second, not first, run theatres."
882,5," The privilege was frequently conditioned on the playing of, or paying for, a designated quantity of the film obligation during 
stated portions of the season."
882,6," Those are the eight major film distributors who originally were defendants.  The charge that these distributors conspired with 
each other was eliminated from the complaint and they were dismissed as defendants by stipulation or on motion of appellant.  
But the charge that each of the distributors had conspired with the appellee exhibitors was retained. "
883,7," Section 1 provides: HN5[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. . . ."""
883,8," Section 2 provides: HN6[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any 
other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . ."""
883,9," So also a conspiracy to monopolize violates § 2 even though monopoly power was never acquired.  American Tobacco Co. v. 
United States, 328 U.S. 781, 789. "
884,10," It was said in United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417, 451, that mere size is not outlawed by § 2.  But size is 
of course an earmark of monopoly power. Moreover, as stated by Justice Cardozo, speaking for the Court in United States v. 
Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 116, ""size carries with it an opportunity for abuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is 
proved to have been utilized in the past."" "
891,1," HN1[
] ""SEC. 12.  That any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all

S. C. § 22."
891,2," These, with the states of their incorporation and their principal places of business, are as follows: State of in Principal place of Corporation corporation business National City Lines, Inc.

California San Francisco Phillips Petroleum Co. Delaware "

892,3," Forty-four cities in sixteen states are included.  The states are as widely scattered as California, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, 
Nebraska, Texas and Washington.  The larger local transportation systems include those of Baltimore, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, 
Los Angeles and Oakland.  The largest concentrations of smaller systems are in Illinois, with eleven cities; California with nine 
(excluding Los Angeles); and Michigan with four.  The local operating companies were not named as parties defendant."
892,4," The appellee companies fall into two groups.  The largest, which may be called the supplier group, includes the six last named 
in note 2 above.  Except Federal, they are engaged in producing and distributing the commodities purchased by the local 
operating companies, the sale of which is charged to be monopolized and restrained.  Federal is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Standard, engaged in managing investments for Standard. The other group, including the first three companies listed in note 2, is collectively called City Lines.  National is a holding 
company with operations directed from Chicago.  American and Pacific are its subsidiaries.  The three own, control or have 
substantial interests in the operating companies. The complaint charges that the supplier appellees furnish capital to City Lines for acquiring control of the local operating 
systems, upon the understanding that City Lines cause all requirements of the local systems in busses, petroleum products, tires 
and tubes to be purchased from the supplier appellees and no other sellers. "
893,5," The prayer of the complaint sought complete divestiture of the supplier appellees' financial interests in City Lines; partial 
divestiture of City Lines' interests in local transportation companies; voiding of existing contracts between the supplier appellees 
and City Lines; and an injunction against purchases from those suppliers by City Lines or their operating companies, except in 
accordance with a competitive bidding plan to be included in the decree."
893,6," In highly attenuated summary the showing was that the transactions creating the core of the charged conspiracy took place 
chiefly in or near Chicago; appellees' chief witnesses and documentary evidence are located there; their transportation to Los 
Angeles and extended presence there will cause great hardship; no defendant ""resides"" or has its principal office or place of 
business in the California district (cf. note 2); and two trials in distant cities, see text infra at note 41, will greatly magnify the 
hardship. See 7 F.R.D. 456, 465."
893,7," The Government stresses that three of the five supplier defendants transact business and are ""found,"" cf. note 1, in the 
California district; the volume of sales allegedly restrained is much greater on the Pacific Coast than elsewhere; substantial 
portions of the evidence, oral and documentary, will be produced from California, etc.  Cf.  7 F.R.D. 456, 465."

893,10," ""SEC. 5.  Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any proceeding under section four of this act may be pending, 
that the ends of justice require that other parties should be brought before the court, the court may cause them to be summoned, 
whether they reside in the district in which the court is held or not; and subpoenas to that end may be served in any district by 
the marshal thereof."" 26 Stat. 210, 15 U. S. C. § 5. Section 4 of the Sherman Act (i. e., ""this act"") refers specifically to civil

895,16," ""HN3[
] Wisely, it has not been attempted to catalogue the circumstances which will justify or require either grant or denial of 
remedy.  The doctrine leaves much to the discretion of the court to which plaintiff resorts, and experience has not shown a 
judicial tendency to renounce one's own jurisdiction so strong as to result in many abuses. ""If the combination and weight of factors requisite to given results are difficult to forecast or state, those to be considered are not 
difficult to name.  An interest to be considered, and the one likely to be most pressed, is the private interest of the litigant. . . .  
The court will weigh relative advantages and obstacles to fair trial."" Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508."
895,17," The Eastman opinion referred to the disadvantages suffered by plaintiffs under § 7 of the Sherman Act who were injured 
where they resided or conducted their business, only to be forced to seek out the wrongdoing company in a distant forum to 
secure venue and service of process, and therefore also to transport witnesses and incur other disadvantages in trial.  273 U.S. 
359, 373-374. Likewise the legislative discussions hereinafter cited uniformly treat the problem as one involving both instituting 
the suit and trying it.  There is no hint that it was contemplated the two phases of the litigation might be separated and conducted 
in different places.  See, e. g., notes 31 and 32 infra."
895,18," Section 12 began as § 10, became § 11 in the Senate, and finally § 12 in conference.  Similarly, § 4 began as § 5, changed 
first to § 3, and finally to § 4.  Section 4 provides for recovery of treble damages in private antitrust proceedings and its venue 
provisions apply in terms only to such suits.  Section 12 applies to ""any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws 
against a corporation."" This literally is broad enough to include the suits comprehended by § 4."
895,19," The original wording of the two sections in respect to venue was slightly different but the substance was identical, both 
following the preexisting provisions of § 7 of the Sherman Act. "
896,20," E. g., Representative Dickinson urged that the language ""be extended sufficiently to reach every contingency, so that these 
concerns may be sued in that jurisdiction where they commit the wrong, where the acts complained of may be committed, where 
the officers, agents, or employees, acting for their master corporation, may be found setting aside the law, and where the 
witnesses are easily obtainable . . . ."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9190.  Later he stated that he wanted to ""give the widest liberty of bringing 
suits where the damage is done and where the action arose."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9417. Representative Sumners spoke to the same effect: ""Mr. Chairman, I believe this matter of venue is one of the most important 
connected with the whole subject of antitrust legislation. . . .  The philosophy of legislation with regard to this subject should give 
the venue at the place wherein the cause of action arises."" Id. 9467.  See also id. 9414, 9415, 9608."
896,21," ""Why not at the end of the section, after the word 'found,' add other words, such as 'doing business, or violating the provisions 
of this law, or wherever it may do business or where its agents, officers, or employees may be found,' or other appropriate 
language.  A dozen suggestions may be made in the way of amendment."" Id. 9190.  See also id. 9414-9417, 9466, 9607, 9663, 
9682."
896,22," ""Mr. SCOTT.  What is the gentleman's understanding of the word 'found'; what is its import as used in this section? ""Mr. DICKINSON.  I understand that there is some decision by some court that I am not very familiar with that may possibly 
cover the very thought suggested by my proposed amendment.  I do not believe that it meets the situation, and if there be any 
doubt about it, in order that the Government may prosecute successfully and institute suits and actions and have trials the 
language ought to be clear and definite, and so plain that he who runs may read, so that there can not be two constructions."" Id. 
9415. ""Mr. CULLOP.  May I suggest . . . that every suit which has arisen under the Sherman antitrust law has been brought at the 
home of the corporation itself, or at its principal place of business, and therefore there was no occasion to construe this 
language, 'is found,' which is ambiguous and uncertain.  If you are to construe 'is found,' you will have to construe that as the 
place of the residence of the corporation, because it is not migratory.  You can not get service upon some person traveling 
throughout the country and hold your jurisdiction throughout that territory. ""Mr. CARLIN.  Why should not the suit be brought in the habitat of the corporation? We have been successful so far in that 
matter. ""Mr. CULLOP.  In this case for the very best reason, I think.  The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. CARLIN] now has disclosed the 
purpose of this language, and that is why I am combating it, and for the best of reasons, I think.  I do not want to make a resident 
of California come to Trenton, N. J., to bring a suit for violation of this law, but I want him to sue at home in the jurisdiction where 
the cause of action arose."" Id. 9416.  See also id. 9466-9467, 9607-9608, 9663-9664."
896,23," E. g., Representative Floyd stated that the provisions were designed ""to give the Government the widest possible scope in 
getting service in these cases, and the provision is right as it is written and ought not to be changed."" Id. 9416."
896,24," ""Mr. FLOYD. . . .  The very broadest language that can be used in a statute of this kind conferring jurisdiction is to give the 
jurisdiction where the corporation resides or is found."" Id. 9415.  And ""I think the provisions relating to service properly drafted as 
they appear in the bill, and that the proposed amendment and others suggested in the debate would narrow the scope of the 
provisions as drawn."" Id. 9417.  And see id. 9608. "
897,25," See, e. g., Representative Cullop's suggestion to confer jurisdiction on state courts without a right of removal to the federal 
courts.  Id. 9662-9664."
897,26," In opposing the suggestion to confer jurisdiction on the state courts, Representative Floyd argued, inter alia, that ""any friend of 
this legislation, as I am sure the gentleman from Indiana [Representative Cullop] is, ought not to aid those who are fighting this 
legislation -- the trusts and the combines of this country -- by loading it down with questionable amendments that will tend to 
defeat it and destroy it in the end."" Id. 9663."
897,27," In place of the House amendment to § 12 of ""or has an agent,"" the Senate committee substituted this language: ""or transacts 
any business; and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be 
found."" Sen. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 73."

897,31," See notes 25, 26.  The following are examples of the discussion on the plaintiff's right to choose: ""Mr. DICKINSON. . . .  I do 
not ask to strike out any language of the committee, but simply to add to it, to make clear and definite and certain so that any "
898,," person and any corporation may be sued not only where it has its residence as a corporation or individual, but that it can be 
sued wherever it is found doing business and the cause of action may arise. ""Mr. STEPHENS of Texas.  . . . I thoroughly agree . . . ."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9414. ""I will say to my friend from Wisconsin [Mr. Stafford] that we are liberalizing the procedure in the courts in order to give the 
individual who is damaged the right to get his damages anywhere -- anywhere you can catch the offender, as is suggested by a 
friend sitting near by."" The quoted language is that of Representative Webb.  51 Cong. Rec. 16274.  See id. 9467, 9607; also 
note 32."
898,32," Mr. SCOTT.  I could not conceive that anything would deprive the plaintiff of his right to choose the place of trial if he so 
desired, either in the district where found or where the corporation resides."" Id. 9417. ""Mr. SCOTT.  . . . The amendment enlarges the present interpretation of the word 'found' as applied to the corporate jurisdiction, 
and permits suit to be brought, with absolute discretion on the part of the plaintiff, in any district in which the defendant may have 
an agent, without defining the character of that agent."" (Emphasis added.) Id. 9467."
898,33," Representative Floyd remarked that the committee ""language was used to make this section conform to the existing law and 
enable him [the Attorney General] to have greater liberty in bringing these suits."" Id. 9415.  And see note 23 supra."
898,34, See notes 6 and 7. 
899,35," It should be noted, however, that HN6[
] ""the mere balance of convenience"" in favor of defendants would be insufficient to 
justify application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  This has been true since the earliest Scottish and English cases 
applying the doctrine, although the test has been variously formulated.  For example, dismissal has been authorized if suit is 
""vexatious and oppressive and an abuse of the process of the Court,"" or ""only brought to annoy the defendant."" See Braucher, 
The Inconvenient Federal Forum, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 908, 909-911. Cf. also note 16 supra."
899,36," Congress has provided that the trial of these actions may, upon request of the Attorney General, ""be given precedence over 
others and in every way expedited, and be assigned for hearing at the earliest practicable day . . . ."" 32 Stat. 823, 15 U. S. C. § 
28. The policy of expediting final decision of these cases is further implemented by authorizing direct appeals to this Court.  32 
Stat. 823, 15 U. S. C. § 29."
899,37," See, e. g., Schine Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110; United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, which were instituted in 
1939 and have recently been remanded for further proceedings in the trial courts.  And the Eastman case, 273 U.S. 359, though 
begun in 1915, was not decided by this Court until 1927."
899,38," In this case, although the proceedings have advanced without unwarranted delay at any one stage, more than a year has 
been consumed solely on the issue of forum non conveniens.  The complaint was filed on April 10, 1947.  Motions to dismiss, 
supported by affidavits to show inconvenience, were filed in August and September.  The trial court made findings and entered 
judgment of dismissal on October 15 and allowed an appeal on December 3.  The Government filed its statement as to 
jurisdiction in this Court on January 20, 1948; we noted probable jurisdiction on February 9, heard oral argument on April 28, and 
today we resolve the issue.  But for the intervention of the motions, the consequent dismissal and appeal, the case with 
appropriate expedition might now be well on the way to final decision on the merits. "
900,39," In this case these possibilities have been discounted, largely upon the basis that the appellees had joined in stipulating that all 
regarded the Illinois forum ""as the proper forum for the above action"" and that, in case of dismissal in the California district and 
filing of a like suit in the Illinois district, the defendants would not move for dismissal of the new suit on the ground of forum non 
conveniens.  The stipulation perhaps would be effective in this case to avoid the complexities of repeated motions if suit were 
reinstituted in Chicago, but not if the Government should select any of the other venues open to it under § 12. In any event, the stipulation is wholly irrelevant to any question of the general effect of the doctrine's applicability upon antitrust 
proceedings.  For once that were established, no defendant or group of defendants in subsequent cases would be bound, or 
perhaps likely, to execute such a stipulation."
900,40," As the Government points out, in practically all of the more complex types of antitrust proceedings, the principal defendants 
are corporations doing a multistate business, and the combination or conspiracy charged seldom has a defined locus.  In such 
situations, it is generally true that, whatever the forum chosen by the plaintiff, it will be inconvenient for some of the defendants 
and often for most of them.  When there is such diffusion of possible venue, that fact of course would be basis for declining to 
apply the doctrine of forum non conveniens, even if applicable.  It is also reason for declining to accept the view that the doctrine 
was intended to be applicable. Thus, in this case, all but two of the appellees were incorporated and hence ""reside"" in Delaware.  None are incorporated in 
Illinois, and only two have their principal places of business or headquarters in Chicago.  The invariable practice for fifty-four 
years, first under § 7, then under § 12, has been that suit may be maintained and trial had at the plaintiff's election where the 
corporation ""resides"" or where it ""is found."" But if this suit had been brought in Delaware or at any of the principal places of 
business except Chicago, under the application of forum non conveniens made here the trial could not have proceeded in any of 
those other places.  Cf.  Tivoli Realty v. Interstate Circuit, 167 F.2d 155. The statute, § 12, does not require trial to be had where 
the agreement in conspiracy takes place.  Locus of coming to agreement is not the gist of the offenses proscribed."
900,41," The indictment was returned on April 9, 1947; on August 14, 1947, defendants' motion to transfer the cause was granted.  The 
civil complaint was filed on April 10, 1947, and dismissed on October 15, 1947."
900,42," Rule 21 (b) provides: ""OFFENSE COMMITTED IN TWO OR MORE DISTRICTS OR DIVISIONS.  The Court upon motion of 
the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as to him to another district or division, if it appears from the indictment or 
information or from a bill of particulars that the offense was committed in more than one district or division and if the court is 
satisfied that in the interest of justice the proceeding should be transferred to another district or division in which the commission "
901,," of the offense is charged."" Cf. note 43 and text.  In addition to the questions there reserved, we express no opinion on whether 
Rule 21 (b) applies to criminal antitrust prosecutions. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure became effective March 21, 1946.  It would be stretching very far the idea of utilizing 
legislative history, if criminal rules adopted twenty-two years after a civil statute was enacted were given any significance upon 
the meaning or effect of the statute."
901,43," The precise point apparently has not arisen since the adoption of Rule 21 (b), but there would seem to be no statutory basis 
for appeal from an order of this type.  See 18 U. S. C. § 682. See also Semel v. United States, 158 F.2d 231, 232."
901,44," All that defendants would have to do, in any practical sense, in order to secure dismissal, would be to convince the District 
Court that transfer of the criminal cause should be made, and then demonstrate the self-evident fact that trial of the two causes 
in different districts would be inconvenient."
901,45," In view of our decision in this civil case, there would be nothing to prevent appellees from making a motion under Rule 21 (b) 
of the Criminal Rules to have the criminal cause retransferred to the Southern District of California, if in the changed outlook 
arising from this decision that should be their pleasure. The Government argues further that as a practical matter there is little likelihood that appellees will be forced to defend both 
actions.  For its distinctly footnote value we quote from its brief: ""When the Government believes that there has been a violation of the Sherman Act, it sometimes seeks corrective relief by way 
of a civil suit filed after, or simultaneously with, the return of a criminal indictment, but when companion proceedings are thus 
instituted it is only rarely that both are ultimately brought to trial.  If it is held on the present appeal that dismissal of the civil 
complaint was erroneous, the Government will not seek to bring the criminal and the civil cases to trial simultaneously and, in 
any event, it is highly unlikely that it will be found necessary to bring both cases to trial. "
902,," ""If the Government obtains a decree in a civil suit, the defendants in a related criminal case usually file pleas of nolo contendere.  
If the criminal case is tried first and verdicts of guilty are returned, there is nothing left for trial in the civil case except the 
question of relief ( Local 167 v. United States, 291 U.S. 293, 298-299), and the parties are customarily able to reach an 
agreement on this question and dispose of the civil case by the entry of a consent decree."""

903,1," ""The court upon motion of the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as to him to another district or division, if it appears from 
the indictment or information or from a bill of particulars that the offense was committed in more than one district or division and 
if the court is satisfied that in the interest of justice the proceeding should be transferred to another district or division in which 
the commission of the offense is charged."""
903,2," ""I do not question the motive of the Government in instituting the prosecution in this district. ""But I am satisfied that a trial here would impose unnecessary hardships on the defendants and entail unjustifiable expense 
which it is the object of the new rules of criminal procedure, and especially of the rule under discussion, to avoid.  Altogether the 
facts spell out the vexatiousness and oppressiveness which the Supreme Court has warned us to eschew in matters of this 
character."" 7 F.R.D. 393, 402-403. "

61 S. Ct. 463, 85 L. Ed. 788, a later statute in pari materia was considered to throw a cross light upon the Anti-trust Acts, 
illuminating enough even to override an earlier ruling of the court."" "

] Whether the application of the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches is concerned in a case where the 
plaintiff's right to damages is founded on a conspiracy must depend upon whether plaintiff had knowledge of the existence of the

corporation, and all evidence on behalf of both the plaintiff and the defendants was elicited either from him or while he was on 
the witness stand. 'The plaintiff, at the conclusion of the evidence yesterday, moved that the court direct the jury to answer the special inquiry in the 
negative.  The defendants separately moved that the court direct the jury to render a verdict on the special issue in the 
affirmative. HN8[
] The court may and it should direct a verdict if the evidence is undisputed or if the evidence, even though it 
be conflicting, be so conclusive that the court, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, should set aside a verdict in opposition 
to it.  Brady v. Southern Railway Company, 320 U.S. 476 (64 S.Ct. 232, 88 L.Ed. 239); Farr Company v. Union Pacific Railroad 
(10 Cir.), 106 F.2d 437; National Mutual Casualty Company (of Tulsa, Okl.) v. Eisenhower (10 Cir.), 116 F.2d 891; Mutual 
Benefit (Health & Accident Ass'n) v. Snyder, (6 Cir.), 109 F.2d 469; Oklahoma Natural Gas Company v. McKee, (10 Cir.), 121 
F.2d 583. 'It appears to the court in this case that the evidence upon the issue now before the jury is undisputed.  All of the evidence 
shows both knowledge and good cause to believe on the part of the plaintiff during the period specified in the special inquiry, 
that its business had been damaged by acts of the defendants in violation of the Antitrust Laws. The statements of the president 
of the defendant corporation, who was the only witness in the case, that he had no knowledge or cause to believe, are opinions, 
and in the opinion of the court are therefore not proper evidence.  However, even if the statements of the president of the 
corporation, who was the only witness, that he had no knowledge or cause for belief be considered as evidence, the court would 
still direct a verdict in the affirmative upon the special issue, because the evidence is so conclusive in favor of an affirmative 
answer upon the special issue that the court would set aside a negative reply by the jury to the special issue.  Statements in 
writing and under oath by the witness Burnham, who was the managing president of the plaintiff, commencing in 1925 and 
continuing throughout the years to 1940, show without dispute a continued awareness and knowledge of the plaintiff's cause of 
action set out in the complaint.  Not only that, but these writings make continuous claim as to the responsibility of the defendants 
for the loss and damage caused to the plaintiff's business.  Consequently, no mere lip service as to the contrary can rise to the 
dignity of creating a factual conflict for resolution by the trier of the fact.  There has been no evidence in the opinion of the court 
of any fraudulent representation or concealment by the defendants of the plaintiff's cause of action which deterred the plaintiff 
from timely presentation of its claim in this court.  The so-called Zabriskie and Emlaw conversations do not by any stretch of the 
imagination go beyond denials of the plaintiff's claim.  In no sense do they reach the statute of fraudulent representations or 
concealment of such an affirmative nature as to in law be misleading to the plaintiff.  Moreover, the evidence without dispute 
shows the plaintiff did not rely upon the statements made by these two men and hence there is no proof of any misleading 
character to be attributed to them. ' * * * there has been a contention made by the plaintiff that the plaintiff made every effort and used every diligent procedure at 
its command to endeavor to obtain what it stated to be the necessary evidence in connection with its asserted cause of action. 
However, the law does not excuse an untimely presentation upon the ground that the party asserting the claim has been unable 
to obtain others to aid in the presentation of the claim.  HN9[
] The burden of presenting an asserted claim in a legal 
proceeding always rests upon the party who has and asserts it, and he may not excuse untimely presentation because he has 
been unable to enlist the aid of others in order to bring about adjudication in the court of his claim. HN10[
] 'The plea of the statute of limitations is not a technical one. No court can disregard it because of a personal desire that 
someone may ultimately obtain recompense for an injury alleged to have been suffered.  The statute of limitations plea is as 
much a component part of the scheme of administration of justice as is the theory that a just claim should be given consideration 
by a court.  There are many reasons why claims must be timely presented.  For the reasons the court has stated, the plaintiff's 
motion for a directed verdict will be denied and the defendants' several motions will be granted.' "

945,3," ""It is not unreasonable for the General Motors Company to have a finance company.  It is not unreasonable for the General 
Motors Company to have contracts with its dealers for a year or to have a cancellation clause in them.  They have a perfect right 
to have a finance company and to recommend its use.  They have a perfect right to cancel a contract from their dealer as long 
as they are not performing any unreasonable act. ""They have a right to determine whom they will sell their cars to, and they have a right to determine whom they will not sell their 
cars to because cars are their product and they are their property and no law compels them to sell them to any man they don't 
want to sell them to; but that is not the charge in this case.  The charge is not that by having difficulty in contracts in itself, these 
defendants did anything wrong; it is not charged here that to recommend the use of GMAC there is anything wrong; it is not 
charged here that cancellation for cause is anything wrongful; but the Government's theory in this case is irrespective of these 
contracts and independent of them and outside of them the conditions have been asserted that they, under the designation of 
those to the grand jurors unknown, the actions have been such that the possibility, the ability to cancel, the ability to refuse to 
renew a contract, have been used as clubs upon the dealers to force them to use GMAC and that these acts that are 
complained of were acts that were used to force the dealers to use GMAC, the Government insists that these acts inspired by 
that motive have been such as to result in cancellations that otherwise would not have occurred; in discriminations that would 
not otherwise have occurred in the shipment of cars in interstate commerce and in refusals to renew that would not otherwise 
have occurred, and in the use of GMAC when it otherwise would not have been used. ""In other words, the Government has no right to complain, and it may not complain of the defendants' right to limit its sales of 
cars to persons whom it may select, its right to determine who it shall sell to, its rights to determine upon what terms it will sell, 
its right to pick its own dealers. ""It can only complain if the defendants do sufficient of these acts charged in the indictment as constitute duress upon the dealer 
to accomplish a result that would have otherwise not have been accomplished, and to make a dealer do something that he 
would not have done of his own free will. ""That, almost, is the question in this case -- whether the dealer could act as a free man; whether he could act of his own free will. ""The defendants say: ""'We never imposed any restrictions upon that freedom of action.' ""The Government says it did and there is that question.  If it did -- if the defendants did that sort of thing -- and if it resulted in an 
unreasonable restriction and unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, then you would have a right to find them guilty. ""If they did not do it, this lawsuit is at an end, and that is a question which you have got to decide. ""You know, you have heard of the terms: ""Exposition; ""Persuasion; ""Argument; ""Coercion. ""They are different steps.  They are graduated steps that I suppose every salesman goes through, except perhaps the last. ""In Exposition one may expound the merits of that which he has to sell; he may explain its nature and by his exposition make a 
clear picture of what he has. ""By persuasion he may endeavor to persuade the person to whom he is talking to accept that which he has to offer. ""There is little advancement in his further progress, to argue. ""Persuasion means something softer than argument, perhaps, but he may argue with him, and argue with him the respective 
merits of his product and other products being offered to the person to whom he makes his offer. ""All of these are proper. ""He may not go beyond that and use something that is within his power to use as a club to coerce the person to accept that 
which he has to offer. "
946,," . . . . ""You must remember that, after all, this coercion, if you find that coercion exists, then the ultimate question is; Has that resulted 
in unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce?  And that is a question for you to determine from all of the evidence."" "

shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years, or by imprisonment in the county jail not 
exceeding one year, or by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or by both such fine

1022,2," Appellants say, after quoting from a concurring opinion in United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 243, ""We believe, 
therefore, that it is perfectly clear that a state may not apply either statutory or common law policies concerning restraint of trade 
to illegalize combinations among workingmen for the purpose of eliminating wage competition throughout a trade or industry."" 
And petitioners further argue that a state may not ""make it unlawful for an employer to acquiesce in union demands that he 
refrain from supplying goods to nonunion peddlers . . . ."""
1022,3," In the International Harvester Co. case, 234 U.S. 199, the then Missouri statute was construed as inapplicable to combinations 
of purchasers and laborers.  For this reason the statute was challenged as denying equal protection of the laws.  Replying to the 
challenge, this Court said at p. 210: ""Whether it would have been better policy to have made such comprehensive classification it 
is not our province to decide.  In other words, whether a combination of wage earners or purchasers of commodities called for 
repression by law under the conditions in the State was for the legislature of the State to determine."" "
1024,4," Eastern States Lumber Dealers v. United States, 234 U.S. 600, was cited in note 21.  In that case the lumber association was a 
combination of retail lumber dealers found by the court to have conspired to prevent wholesale dealers from selling directly to 
consumers of lumber.  The sole basis for the injunction was the distribution and dissemination of truthful information by the 
association to its members in an official report.  This Court sustained the decree which broadly enjoined the distribution of this 
truthful information. The cases cited in note 21 of the Thornhill opinion include the following, strongly emphasizing states' powers to regulate their 
internal industrial and economic affairs and rejecting contentions that challenged regulations violated the Federal Constitution.  
Senn v. Tile Layers Union, 301 U.S. 468; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502; 
Dorchy v. Kansas, 272 U.S. 306; Aikens v. Wisconsin, 195 U.S. 194; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366. Another case cited in note 
21 of the Thornhill opinion was Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309 U.S. 436. It also involved a violation of the federal 
antitrust laws, and once again this Court sustained the power of the Government to enjoin trade practices deemed in violation of 
those laws.  The only other case cited in note 21, Labor Board v. Newport News Co., 308 U.S. 241, sustained an order against 
an employer which restrained it from using its influence over employees to interfere with their activities."
1024,5," Both parties here rely on the Ritter case.  Empire contends that this Court affirmed the action of the Texas courts on the basis 
of the state's antitrust law.  Appellants argue that this Court upheld the Texas injunction on the ground that the business 
picketed did not bear a sufficiently close relation to the labor dispute to justify picketing at that place.  Since the Court relied on 
this ground, appellants contend that the Court impliedly rejected the contention that the injunction was justified because of an 
alleged violation of the antitrust laws. This Court's opinion in the Ritter case, as well as the dissents, did emphasize questions 
other than the antitrust act contentions.  The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas had not mentioned the Texas antitrust laws in its 
first or second opinion in the Ritter case.  138 S. W. 2d 223, 149 S. W. 2d 694. A third opinion, denying rehearing, did make 
reference for the first time to the state's antitrust laws, but did not definitely point out in what way the picketers' conduct violated 
any specific provision of these laws.  149 S. W. 2d 694, 699. Under these circumstances nothing that was said in the Ritter 
opinion stands for the principle that speech and writings, utilized as a part of conduct engaged in only to break a valid anti-trade-
restraint law, render that course of conduct immune from state control. "
1025,6," ""Picketing by an organized group is more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very 
presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being 
disseminated.  Hence those aspects of picketing make it the subject of restrictive regulation."" Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, 
supra, at 776-777. The opinion in Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 537-538 stated: "". . . When to this persuasion other things are added which 
bring about coercion, or give it that character, the limit of the right has been passed. . . .  But short of that limit the employer's 
freedom cannot be impaired.  The Constitution protects no less the employees' converse right.  Of course espousal of the cause 
of labor is entitled to no higher constitutional protection than the espousal of any other lawful cause.  It is entitled to the same 
protection."" A concurring opinion in Thomas v. Collins, at 543-544, stated this: ""But once he uses the economic power which he has over 
other men and their jobs to influence their action, he is doing more than exercising the freedom of speech protected by the First 
Amendment.  That is true whether he be an employer or an employee.  But as long as he does no more than speak he has the 
same unfettered right, no matter what side of an issue he espouses."" "
1032,1," Standard Stations, Inc., has no independent status in these proceedings; since 1944 its activities have been confined to 
managing service stations owned by the Standard Oil Co. of California."

] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal: . . . ."" 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.

price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, 
wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the 
effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 14."
1033,4," After the Clayton Bill, H. R. 15657, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., had passed the House, the Senate struck § 4, the section prohibiting 
tying clauses and requirements contracts, on the ground that such practices were subject to condemnation by the Federal Trade "
1034,," Commission under the then pending Trade Commission Bill.  In support of a motion to reconsider this vote, Senator Reed of 
Missouri argued that the Trade Commission would be unlikely to outlaw agreements of a type held by this Court, in Henry v. A. 
B. Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1, not to be in violation of the Sherman Act. See 51 Cong. Rec. 14088, 14090-92.  The motion was agreed 
to.  Id. at 14223."
1034,5," It is clear, of course, that HN3[
] the ""line of commerce"" affected need not be nationwide, at least where the purchasers 
cannot, as a practical matter, turn to suppliers outside their own area.  Although the effect on competition will be quantitatively 
the same if a given volume of the industry's business is assumed to be covered, whether or not the affected sources of supply 
are those of the industry as a whole or only those of a particular region, a purely quantitative measure of this effect is inadequate 
because the narrower the area of competition, the greater the comparative effect on the area's competitors. Since it is the "
1035,," preservation of competition which is at stake, the significant proportion of coverage is that within the area of effective 
competition.  Cf. Indiana Farmer's Guide Publishing Co. v. Prairie Farmer Publishing Co., 293 U.S. 268, 279; United States v. 
Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 226. The criteria of substantiality deemed relevant in cases involving a nationwide market are 
thus also relevant in measuring the effect of Standard's requirements contracts in the seven-state Western area. "
1036,6," Standard urges that the effect of its contracts is similarly confined in view of the fact that they apply not to all sales by a dealer 
but only to those made through a designated service station. Putting aside the fact that it does not appear that dealers 
commonly own more than one service station, there is marked difference between a contract which confines an entire retail 
outlet to the sale of a single brand and a contract which merely confines the use of a dispensing mechanism to a single brand: 
service-station sites, and therefore retail outlets, are limited in number; the number of pumps which a dealer may choose to set 
up is not, or so, at least, the Court assumed in the Sinclair case.  It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that competition between 
suppliers is directed rather toward exclusive contracts with the maximum number of strategically located outlets than toward 
exclusive arrangements with dealers as such. "
1037,7," The Court considered and found inadequate defendant's attempt to establish that the successful use of the machines 
depended upon a quality of salt which only it could supply, but the Court's willingness to consider such evidence does not 
weaken the holding that coverage of a more than insignificant volume of business by such tying clauses is an adequate basis for 
finding a lessening of competition or a tendency to monopoly."
1037,8," It may be noted in passing that the exclusive supply provisions for tires, tubes, batteries, and other accessories which are a 
part of some of Standard's contracts with dealers who have also agreed to purchase their requirements of petroleum products 
should perhaps be considered, as a matter of classification, tying rather than requirements agreements."
1037,9," This advantage is not conferred by Standard's contracts, each of which provides that the price to be paid by the dealer is to be 
the ""Company's posted price to its dealers generally at time and place of delivery."" "
1038,10," Some members of the House opposed § 4 of H. R. 15657, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. (the equivalent of what is now § 3) as denying 
this benefit to the newcomer, see 51 Cong. Rec. 9267, and Representative McCoy of New Jersey offered an amendment, id. at 
9398, to make the agreements in question illegal only when entered ""with the intent of obtaining or establishing a monopoly or of 
destroying the business of a competitor,"" which he and others supported on this ground.  See id. at 9400-02, 9409.  The 
amendment was rejected.  Id. at 9410."
1038,11," For an exposition of the considerations here summarized, see Stockhausen, The Commercial and Anti-Trust Aspects of Term 
and Requirements Contracts, 23 N. Y. U. L. Q. Rev. 412, 417-31 (1948)."
1038,12," Upon the request of Standard, its six largest competitors filled out questionnaires showing the number of retail dealers who 
distributed their products during the years 1937 through 1946.  Though their position relative to each other has fluctuated, the "
1039,," figures show that as a group they have maintained or improved their control of the market.  Together with Standard, these six 
companies distributed, as of 1946, through 26,439 of approximately 35,000 independent service stations in the Western area."
1039,13," The dual system of enforcement provided for by the Clayton Act must have contemplated standards of proof capable of 
administration by the courts as well as by the Federal Trade Commission and other designated agencies.  See 38 Stat. 734, 
736, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 21, 25.  Our interpretation of the Act, therefore, should recognize that an appraisal of economic 
data which might be practicable if only the latter were faced with the task may be quite otherwise for judges unequipped for it 
either by experience or by the availability of skilled assistance."
1039,14," The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, adopted July 30, 1948, provides, as one mode of 
procedure, for reference of restrictive trade practices by the Board of Trade to a permanent Commission for investigation in 
order to determine ""whether any such things as are specified in the reference . . . operate or may be expected to operate against 
the public interest."" 11 & 12 Geo. VI, c. 66, § 6 (2).  The Act does not define what is meant by ""the public interest,"" although in § 
14 it sets up broad criteria to be taken into account.  It is noteworthy, however, that, having established so broad a basis for 
investigation, the Act entrusts the task to an expert body without provision for judicial review.  This approach was repeatedly 
contrasted in debate with that of the United States.  See 449 H. C. Deb. 2046-47, 2058, 2063 (5th ser. 1948); 157 H. L. Deb. 350 
(5th ser. 1948).  Compare § 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 41 Stat. 480, 49 U. S. C. § 5 (2), referring to the 
Interstate Commerce Commission determination of the more defined issues of ""public interest"" under review in New York 
Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U.S. 12, 24; United States v. Lowden, 308 U.S. 225. "
1040,15," Representative Floyd of Arkansas, one of the managers on the part of the House, explained the use of the word ""substantially"" 
as deriving from the opinion of this Court in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211, and quoted the passage 
from id. at 229 in which it is said that ""the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce comprises the right to enact a law 
prohibiting the citizen from entering into those private contracts which directly and substantially, and not merely indirectly, 
remotely, incidentally and collaterally, regulate to a greater or less degree commerce among the States."" 51 Cong. Rec. 16317-
18.  Senator Chilton, one of the managers on the part of the Senate, denying that the clause weakened the bill, stated that the 
words ""where the effect may be"" mean ""where it is possible for the effect to be."" Id. at 16002.  Senator Overman, also a Senate 
conferee, argued that even the elimination of competition in a single town would substantially lessen competition.  Id. at 15935."
1040,16," See United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 179: ""Applying the rule of reason to the construction of the statute, it was held in the Standard Oil Case that as the words 'restraint of 
trade' at common law and in the law of this country at the time of the adoption of the Anti-trust Act only embraced acts or 
contracts or agreements or combinations which operated to the prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition 
or unduly obstructing the due course of trade or which, either because of their inherent nature or effect or because of the evident 
purpose of the acts, etc., injuriously restrained trade, that the words as used in the statute were designed to have and did have 
but a like significance."" See also Handler, A Study of the Construction and Enforcement of the Federal Antitrust Laws 3-9 (T. N. 
E. C. Monograph No. 38, 1941).  Compare § 4 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, 1906, which forbids combinations 
entered into ""with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public,"" construed in Attorney General v. Adelaide 
S. S. Co., [1913] A. C. 781, as requiring proof of actual economic detriment."
1040,17," ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint 
was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, 
the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts."" 246 U.S. at 238. "
1041,1," See Final Report and Recommendations of the Temporary National Economic Committee, S. Doc. No. 35, 77th Cong., 1st 
Sess. (1941).  For more detailed analyses, see Competition and Monopoly in American Industry (TNEC Monograph 21, 1940)

Largest Nonfinancial Corporations (TNEC Monograph 29, 1940); Relative Efficiency of Large, Medium-Sized, and Small 
Business (TNEC Monograph 13, 1941). The merger and acquisition movement, which has been evident since the turn of the century and which contributed to the 
spiraling concentration of corporate wealth into the hands of the few, has not ended.  We are presently in the midst of a similar 
movement.  See the Federal Trade Commission report, The Present Trend of Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions, Sen. Doc. 
No. 17, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), p. 6, where it is shown that ""the increase in the merger movement following VJ-day 
parallels very closely the sharp upward movement which took place at the end of World War I."" The causes which have recently 
contributed to the growing bigness of big corporations are varied.  See Lynch, The Concentration of Economic Power (1946), pp. 
3-4 where it is said: ""Even before the entrance of the United States into the war the placing of defense contracts served to augment the growth of 
bigness in industry and to intensify the struggle for survival by small concerns.  By 1941 the pattern of defense contracts which, 
with modifications, was to remain for the duration of the war had been established.  It is reported that in that year fifty-six firms, 
less than one-half of 1 percent of the manufacturing establishments of the country, were awarded 75 percent of all the contracts. "
1042,," Concentration was even more marked within this group, however, inasmuch as six corporations held 31 percent of the total.  
Between June, 1940, and March, 1943, more than 100 million dollars worth of prime warsupply contracts were awarded.  
Seventy percent of these were held by the leading 100 corporations; 10 corporations held 32 percent, and the leading 50 held 60 
percent. ""Studies by the United States Department of Commerce during 1943-1944 throw additional light on this trend toward industrial 
concentration.  After Pearl Harbor the total number of firms in business declined precipitously.  Despite the wartime industrial 
boom, the number of firms which discontinued operations was greater than that replaced by new entries; it is estimated that the 
number in business in 1943 was nearly 17 percent less than in 1941.  There are numerous indications that the relative 
importance of small business has declined during the war period and that the dominance of big business has become more 
marked.  Between 1938 and 1942 it appears that the total number of workers employed by 95 percent of the nation's 
corporations (the smallest) declined 23 percent, whereas those employed by 5 percent of the corporations (the largest) 
increased 22 percent.  A related study indicates that between January 1, 1941, and January 1, 1943, business firms employing 
fewer than 125 workers each experienced an increase in employment of 1 percent and an increase in the value of their product 
(attributable principally to price increases) of 16 percent; during the same period, however, the increase in employment by the 
large establishments employing more than 125 workers was 62 percent and the increase in the value of the product, 96 
percent."""

whereby the Court allowed those who had built one of the tightest monopolies in American history largely to retain their ill-gotten 
gains and continue their hold on the economy.  The philosophy of that decision can be summed up in the words Brandeis used 
to describe the decree effecting a so-called dissolution of the American Tobacco Co.  He said that its defenders ""appear to have 
discovered in the Constitution a new implied prohibition: 'What man has illegally joined together, let no court put asunder.'"" The

the defendant started with a patent monopoly of the machine for utilization of its product.  The customers, canners, were in effect 
the ultimate consumers of salt as such.  But they could get the advantages of the invention only if they tied themselves to use no 
other salt therein. "

7326; 56 Cong.Rec. 119. Senator Pomerene openly stated to the Senate considering the Act: ' * * * although an association 
organized under the pending bill should enter into some agreement or perform some act in a foreign country which met the 
requirements of law there, if at the same time the effect of it were such as to materially interfere with the policy of the United 
States under its trust laws, then it would be subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities of this country, including both the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.' (56 Cong.Rec. 170) In refuting the contention that the Webb Act would permit associations formed under the Act to participate in world-wide cartels, 
Senator Pomerene declared: ' * * * if I may refer to another phase of this debate, a very plausible argument was made on yesterday when the position was 
taken in substance that this bill was a repeal of the Sherman antitrust law, and if it became the law of the land and these 
associations were authorized they would at once seek to control the foreign market, and probably enter into a combination with 
foreign companies and cartels engaged in the same line of business * * * .' 'If the Senator when making this argument had recited facts instead of fancies, there might have been some force in his 
utterances, but he was giving free rein to his imagination. The Senator overlooked the fact that this bill does not repeal the 
Sherman law.' (56 Cong.Rec. 172) Further statements by Senator Pomerene were to the same effect. He declared, in speaking of the Webb Act, 'It does not repeal, 
it does not affect the Sherman law so far as it applies to domestic commerce. It strengthens the Sherman law and the Federal "
1068,," Trade Commission law, in so far as unfair practices are concerned beyond territorial lines.' (56 Cong.Rec. 173); he specifically 
pointed out that 'There is nothing in this bill authorizing the division of territory abroad.' (56 Cong.Rec. 181)"

1068,20," .  The intent of the agreement of 1928 to bar shipments to the United States is not clear. In any case, the 1935 agreement 
superseded all prior arrangements and indicated that the United States was 'Territory common to both Parties' and that I.C.I. and 
Belgian Solvay would each have the right 'to manufacture and to sell in the United States * * * .' The division of 1938 shows joint 
participation in the American market. "

these areas. (Gov. ex. 82, 83, 85, 102, 104) But this was only an alternative remedy to the control of material and the elimination 
of all competing exports from the United States itself (Gov. ex. 83, 84, 104)."

American exporters. See Temporary National Economic Committee, Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power,

Ash.' (Gov. ex. 110)"
1072,28," .  Calkex by a resolution of its Board of Directors required members to export exclusively through Calkex (Gov. ex. 146). It also 
abolished the formal requirement of the resolution in 1940 (Gov. ex. 147), but all members continued to export exclusively 
through Calkex thereafter. In domestic sales, Calkex members likewise maintained contract provisions restricting the use of ash 
sold to the consumption of the purchaser (Gov. ex. 164, 165). Its members supplied statistics regarding export shipments made 
independently of Calkex (Gov. ex. 107), and cooperated fully with Alkasso in eliminating export competition (Gov. ex. 74, 93, 95, 
97, 108). "

1110,3," .  The trial court stated, 'There is no question that all fourteen defendants are properly suable in this (Delaware) district', and 
concluded, as we have said, that five defendants did not transact business in Texas.  See 89 F.Supp.at page 279. The court 
cited Mebco Realty Holding Co. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., D.C.N.J., 45 F.Supp. 340 and Westor Theatres, Inc. v. Warner 
Bros. Pictures, inc., D.C.N.J., 43 F.Supp. 757. But compare Giusti v. Pyrotechnic Industries, 9 Cir., 156 F.2d 351. No reference 
was made to United States v. Scophony Corporation, 333 U.S. 795, 68 S.Ct. 855, 92 L.Ed. 1091. The complaints, defendants' 
affidavits and an affidavit filed by counsel for the plaintiffs seem to raise an issue of fact within the purview of the Scophony 
decision as to whether the five defendants referred to were transacting business in Texas.  This issue could have been resolved 
only by the taking of oral testimony.  Cf.  Frederick Hart & Co. v. Recordgraph Corporation, 3 Cir., 169 F.2d 580. On the instant 
record there would seem to be as much basis for a conclusion that the five defendants referred to were transacting business in 
Texas as for the conclusion that the four New York corporations were transacting business in Delaware.  In the view that we take 
of the cases at bar it is unnecessary to determine this fact issue. "

very similar issues were raised in a removal case."
1111,9," .  In Jiffy Lubricator Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corporation, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 360, 363, it was said that the congressional purpose in 
enacting Section 1404(a) was ' * * * to grant broadly the power of transfer for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the 
interest of justice, whether dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens would have been appropriate or not.' See also 
United States v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., D.C.D.C., 83 F.Supp. 233, 234. "
1112,10," .  The facts in the Ferguson case were very similar to those before the trial court in the pending Delaware actions, assuming 
arguendo that five of the corporate defendants do not transact business in Texas.  In the Ferguson case, jurisdiction was also 
based on the antitrust laws, and the court held, in view of the consent of the defendants to be sued in Michigan, the transferee 
forum, that it was not necessary that ' * * * venue in the transferee forum be proper as to every one of a number of defendants 
before transfer may be ordered.' Judge Ryan went on to say, 'Such a result (authorizing transfer) is possible, if the statutory 
condition is construed as requiring the transferee forum to be a proper venue as to at least one of the defendants in a multi-
defendant case; in such a situation it can fairly be said that the action might have been brought there in a venue sense.' See 89 
F.Supp.at pages 48, 49. Cf. the disposition of the application for mandamus against Judge Ryan, sub non.  Ford Motor Co. v. 
Ryan, 2 Cir., 182 F.2d 329. Cf.  McCarley v. Foster-Milburn Co., D.C.W.D.N.Y., 89 F.Supp. 643, and the disposition of the 
application for mandamus against Judge Knight, sub non. Foster-Milburn Co. v. Knight, 2 Cir., 181 F.2d 949. See also United States v. National City Lines, 337 U.S. 78, 69 S.Ct. 955, 959, 93 L.Ed. 1226, in which the issue was whether 
Section 1404(a) extended the doctrine of forum non conveniens to a civil antitrust suit brought by the United States.  There was 
a stipulation by the defendants not to raise the venue issue in the transferee forum.  The Supreme Court decided that the case 
might be transferred. Inferentially this supports Judge Ryan's position in Ferguson v. Ford Motor Company, supra. Judge 
Rodney, in considering the motion to transfer the actions with which we are presently concerned, pointed out that since United 
States v. National City Lines was a civil suit brought by the United States, Section 5 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  
§ 5, would have permitted the United States to bring in additional parties and he treated Section 5 as a venue statute enlarging 
the scope of Section 12 of the Clayton Act, disagreeing with Judge Ryan's interpretation of the National City Lines decision.  
Though Section 5 is a venue statute no additional parties were sought to be brought in by the United States as defendants in the 
National City Lines suit and therefore in our opinion Judge Ryan was right on this aspect of the matter.  We conclude, 
nonetheless, that the question presently before us was not in focus in the National City Lines case before the Supreme Court."
1112,11," .  We have not referred to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Tivoli Realty Co. v. Interstate Circuit, 167 
F.2d 155, reversing D.C., 75 F.Supp. 93, for the reason that it is irrelevant to the issues presented in the instant cases, Section 
1404(a) not being in effect at the time of the decision, viz., on March 18, 1948. "
1114,1," .  Cf.  Foster-Milburn Co. v. Knight, 2 Cir., 1950, 181 F.2d 949."
1114,2," .  Such is the common law rule.  Restatement, Conflict of Laws, Secs. 89, 92 (1934).  This rule is given full effect by the 
limitations imposed upon the process of district courts by Rule 4(d) and (f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Compare the 
decision of this court in Orange Theatre Corp. v. Rayherst Amusement Corp., 3 Cir., 1944, 139 F.2d 871."
1114,3," .  A corporation may transact business within a state yet not be subject to process of a district court there.  With the conception 
of transacting business stated in United States v. Scophony Corp., 1948, 333 U.S. 795, 68 S.Ct. 855, 92 L.Ed. 1091, contrast 
the more limited provision for service of process upon a corporation in Rule 4(d)(3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "

1116,8," .  Relying in large measure upon this absence of relationship between these defendants and Texas, the Court of Appeals for the

1151,3," .  For example, Tampa, Florida is the site of plaintiff's cannery, a cannery of California Packing Corporation and one of Stokely 
Brothers. Each of these canneries bought cans from defendant under identical contracts. The annual purchase of each of these 
three canneries was approximately equal. Plaintiff received no discount during the period in dispute, with the exception of a 1% 
discount in 1939. California Packing Corporation received a 5% discount as a result of being permitted to pool its purchases, and 
Stokely Brothers received a discount of between 3% and 4% for the same reason. The economic advantage thus derived over 
plaintiff by these competitors is patent. "
1152,4," .  The evidence reveals that for years defendant had maintained a policy of equalizing freight for a purchaser to the factory or 
plant nearest the point of delivery of the can shipment, irrespective of where the cans were manufactured. Plaintiff had many 
times theretofore purchased the 3.12 Iscan and other Iscans on the basis of this freight pricing policy."
1152,5," .  In Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 826, 92 L.Ed. 1196, the Supreme Court, in 
condemning an arbitrary discount system similar to the one before us as discriminatory, stated: 'Theoretically, these discounts 
are equally available to all, but functionally they are not'. "
1176,1," Inclusion of Messrs. Gieb and Moore in the suit at all is highly questionable.  On the occasions in question they were officers of 
the respective cities, performing duties within their jurisdiction and discretion and no less immune than the courts from civil suit. 
Judge Bonner, in Rains v. Simpson, 50 Tex. 495, upon vigorous restatement of this fundamental rule, quotes from an early 
authority, viz.: ""'I prefer to place the decision on the broad ground that no public officer is responsible in a civil suit for a judicial 
determination, however erroneous it may be, and however malicious the motive which prompted it.  Such acts, when corrupt, 
may be punished criminally, but the law will not allow malice and corruption to be charged in a civil suit against such an officer 
for what he does in the performance of a judicial duty. The rule extends to judges from the highest to the lowest; to jurors, and to 
all public officers, whatever name they may bear, in the exercise of judicial power.'"" (Emphasis mine.) In the same connection, counsel for Gieb also poses the question of whether under the circumstances of this case, his agency 
for the city can be raised by appellant in face of the sell settled rule that in transactions where the agent acts for both parties 
unknown to one of them, the issue is available only to the principal and not to a third party.  See Newton v. Mann, 111 Colo. 76, 
137 P.2d 776, 147 A.L.R. 772 and cases there cited. "

passage on non-scheduled air lines, by means of direct threats of imposing and by imposing a commercial boycott upon plaintiff 
and by revoking plaintiff's ticket agency contracts with defendant air lines; '(b) Organized threats of punitive boycott action against plaintiff in order to prevent and stop plaintiff's display of placards, 
posters and other advertising materials announcing the sale and distribution of air transportation tickets on non-scheduled air 
lines; '(c) An attempt, through control and manipulation of the ATC and IATA system of approved travel agent lists, to destroy plaintiff's 
business and commercial standing; '(d) Concerted use of the organizational structure, and the policy-making and policing powers of the ATC and IATA, to intimidate, 
coerce and restrain plaintiff from dealing as a travel agent with non-scheduled air lines, and to apply commercial boycott 
sanctions in punitive retaliation for such dealings with non-scheduled air carriers; '(e) Utilization of the machinery of CAB proceedings to serve the carrying on and fostering of the concerted program to impose a 
destructive commercial boycott upon plaintiff; '(f) Threats of reprisal and punitive action against plaintiff's travel agency business for testifying on behalf of a non-scheduled 
carrier before the CAB; '(g) Harassing, disparaging, discrediting and impugning plaintiff's business dealings and relations; '(h) A concerted cancellation of plaintiff's travel agency contract agreements with defendant air lines, designed to effectuate a 
commercial boycott against plaintiff in reprisal for plaintiff's refusal to cease dealing with the non-scheduled air lines; coercing 
and intimidating plaintiff into abandoning of agency agreements and rights thereunder; all of which was planned, organized and 
designed to injure, damage and destroy plaintiff's business.' The complaint also alleges violation of other provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 49 U.S.C.A. 401 et seq., which may be 
characterized as unfair trade practices. The allegations of conspiracy here are in substantial degree similar to the conspiracy allegations in S.S.W., Inc. v. Air Transport

1233,*," In that report, at page 10, the following statement appears: ""The commission desires to call particular attention to its solution of 
a problem which arose in preparing the codification of the Cartwright Anti-Trust Act (Chapter 530, Statutes of 1907, as 
amended). In 1909 (Chapter 362) the act was amended, among other things, to provide certain exemptions in Section 1. ""The Federal District Court for the Southern District of California has held that these exemptions, added to the California Act in 
1909, are unconstitutional and not separable and that, therefore, the entire California act is invalid. ( Blake vs. Paramount 
Pictures, Inc., (1938) 22 F. Supp. 249). This decision relies on the United States Supreme Court decision which held 
unconstitutional a Colorado antitrust statute, containing exemptions substantially identical to those added to Section 1 of the 
California act in 1909, on the ground that these exemptions, a part of the Colorado statute as originally enacted, made the 
required standard of conduct too uncertain for a penal statute. ( Cline vs. Frink Dairy Co. (1927) 274 U.S. 445, 71 L. Ed. 1146, 
47 S. Ct. 681). ""The Attorney General of California is of the opinion that this 1909 amendment was invalid in view of the holding in Cline vs. 
Frink Dairy Co., never became a part of the 1907 act, hence that Section 1 of the Cartwright Act in the form in which originally 
enacted is valid and operative. (Opinion NS 2806, July 29, 1940.) "
1234,," ""In the absence of a decision by the California Supreme Court, the commission has prepared a codification of the entire 
California act, as amended. As thus codified, without substantial change, it will, of course, have neither greater nor less validity, 
operation or effect than prior to codification. ( Business and Professions Code, Sec. 2: San Joaquin etc. Irr. Co. vs. Stevinson, 
164 Cal. 221, at 233, 128 P. 924 and 234; Sobey vs. Molony, 40 Cal. App. 2d 381, 104 P.2d 868.) However, as a special 
precaution, the commission has inserted a specific saving clause (Section 16701) which is specially designed to leave as it is the 
question of separability, so that the 1907 Cartwright Act, and the 1909 amendments thereto, will manifestly have no greater (and 
no less) validity, operation, or effect than if they had not been codified."" "

1246,2," There has been no determination and apparently there is no contention by respondent that some part of the expenses of 
litigation (the $ 162,991.13) is nondeductible or includible in income because related to nontaxable items of income.  We 
accordingly find it unnecessary to consider the principle involved in the following language in Glenshaw Glass Co., supra, p. 872: ""The parties * * * further agreed that the fees allocated to the claims that gave rise to taxable income are deductible as an 
ordinary and necessary business expense, and that the fees allocated to the claims that did not give rise to taxable income 
are not deductible."" "
1247,3," The total settlement in Glenshaw Glass Co., supra, was not trebled on a one-third-two-thirds basis because some part of the

and 15(c) of the 1934 Act.  In administering these Acts the SEC has uniformly dealt with these sections as part of an integral 
plan to protect investors in the securities markets generally, and has consistently held exchange transactions and over-the-
counter transactions to be subject alike to these broad powers of prohibition and regulation. Sec. 17(a) of the 1933 Act, and 
Secs. 9 and 10(b) of the 1934 Act have remained in their original form.  In 1936 and 1938, however, the Congress added to Sec. 
15 of the 1934 Act certain additional specifications as to manipulative devices by incorporating subsection (c) therein. "

1326,1," This is to be distinguished from purchases in the open market by the manager for the purpose of covering ""over-allotments."" 
Knowing that some may decline to participate and others may refuse to take all of what he proposes to allot to them, the 
manager will sometimes allot and offer more than he has, hoping to come out even.  If then all accept, he has an ""oversold"" 
position.  Whether or not the SEC will regard this as stabilizing becomes a question of the original intention of the manager. "

the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 25, 1934 dealt extensively with 
this subject, in which this interdepartmental committee, headed by John Dickinson, under appointment by the Secretary of 
Commerce, had evinced special interest during the course of its investigation.  Mr. Dickinson was an Assistant Secretary of 
Commerce and his committee was one of considerable distinction, including among its members, A. A. Berle, Jr., James M. 
Landis, later to become chairman of the SEC, Henry J. Richardson and Arthur H. Dean, of counsel for several of the defendants 
in this case.  See comments on the operation of the syndicate system and stabilizing transactions connected therewith (Report, 
pp. 13-15).  The general recommendation is study and regulation. This report was submitted shortly before the hearings on the 
bills which, after a certain amount of redrafting, subsequently became the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  See also testimony 
of Thomas G. Corcoran, a coauthor of the bill, before the Senate Committee (Hearings before Senate Committee on Banking 
and Currency on S. 2693, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 1934, p. 6512) and that of Thomas G. Corcoran and James M. Landis, then a 
Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission engaged in administering the Securities Act of 1933, before the house 
Committee (Hearings before House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.R. 7852 and 8720, 73d Cong., 2d 
Sess. 1934, pp. 114 and 21). "

75th Cong.), following a message from President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 29, 1938, stating a need for a thorough study of 
economic power and its effects on the American economy. Hearings with respect to investment banking were held between 
December 12, 1939 and January 12, 1940, and were recorded in Parts 22 through 24 of the published hearings.  The 729 page 
Report, while containing a number of conclusions and recommendations with respect to other phases of the investigation, makes

1366,26," .  In City of Atlanta v. Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Co., C.C.E.D.Tenn.1900, 101 F. 900, the district court considered two 
actions brought to recover damages under Section 7 of the Sherman Act (Act of July 2, 1890, ch. 647; 26 Stat. 209).  Following 
the decision of the Supreme Court in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 1899, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S.Ct. 96, 44 L.Ed. 136, 
plaintiffs alleged that, by reason of the unlawful combination, defendants had advanced the price of their steel pipe, and that 
plaintiffs were in consequence compelled to pay an exorbitant and unfair price.  The defendants interposed as a defense the 
Tennessee statutes of limitation of one and three years as found in the Code of Tennessee (Shannon's Revisal), § 4469, 4470. 
The former section prescribed a limitation of one year to actions for statutory penalties and injuries to the person.  The latter 
prescribed a limitation of three years for injuries to property, real and personal.  To these pleas, plaintiffs demurred upon the 
ground that 1047 of the Federal Revised Statutes applied to the action.  That federal statute read: "
1367,," 'No suit or prosecution for any penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States, shall 
be maintained, except in cases where it is otherwise specially provided, unless the same is commenced within five years from 
the time when the penalty or forfeiture accrued * * *.' (Now 28 U.S.C.A.  § 2462) The district court, relying upon Huntington v. Attrill, 1892, 146 U.S. 657, 13 S.Ct. 224, 36 L.Ed. 1123, held that the federal statute 
of limitations applied only to actions maintainable by the United States.  It then proceeded to analyze the Tennessee statutes of 
limitation.  It held that the one-year statute, § 4469, was not applicable, construing the word 'penalty' therein to mean the same 
as in the rejected federal statute. It held applicable the three-year statute, § 4470, which read as follows: ""Actions for injuries to personal or real property; actions for the detention or conversion of personal property, within three years 
from the accruing of the cause of action."" Specifically it held that the causes of action barred by Section 4470 included 'every species of injury to personal property 
included in the more general or collective name of torts or civil wrongs.' 101 F. at page 910. The appeal was heard by a Circuit Court of Appeals, including Circuit Judge Lurton, who wrote the opinion, and who had 
theretofore been a Justice and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Tennessee. The Circuit Court of Appeals (6 Cir., 1903, 127 
F. 23, 64 L.R.A. (721) agreed that Section 1047, supra, was not applicable and that the one-year Tennessee statute of 
limitations was also not applicable.  The Circuit Court of Appeals then held that the cause of action was not one for an injury to 
property within the meaning of the Tennessee three-year statute, Section 4470.  It pointed out that the English Statute of 21 
James I, c. 16, operated upon the form of action and was therefore fore no longer applicable in Tennessee, where the rule had 
been adopted that the statute of limitations applicable depends upon the nature and character of the action, not upon its form.  
The court concluded that the ten-year Tennessee statute, § 4473, the catch-all provision, applied. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.  The unanimous opinion of the Court was written by Mr. Justice 
Holmes and is reported sub nom.  Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta, 1906, 203 U.S. 390, 27 S.Ct. 65, 66, 
51 L.Ed. 241. The Supreme Court held that the limitation of five years in the Federal Revised Statutes, Section 1047, to any 'suit 
or prosecution for any penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States' did not apply, 
relying upon Huntington v. Attrill, 1892, 146 U.S. 657, 13 S.Ct. 224, 36 L.Ed. 1123, and Brady v. Daly, 1899, 175 U.S. 148, 20 
S.Ct. 62, 44 L.Ed. 109. The Supreme Court concurred with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the plaintiffs' cause of action fell 
within the catch-all statute (Code of Tennessee (Shannon's Revisal), § 4473), saying, 203 U.S. at page 398, 27 S.Ct. at page 
66: 'Although the decision is appealed from, as this question involves the construction of local law we cannot but attribute weight to 
the opinion of the judge who rendered the judgment, in view of his experience upon the supreme court of Tennessee.'"
1367,27," .  Section 2462, 28 U.S.C.A. provides: 'Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or 
forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first 
accrued if, within the same period, the offender or the property is found within the United States in order that proper service may 
be made thereon.' "

costs as determined by the court, plus whichever of the following sums is greater: (1) Such amount not more than three times 
the amount of the overcharge, or the overcharges, upon which the action is based as the court in its discretion may determine, 
or (2) an amount not less than $ 25 nor more than $ 50, as the court in its discretion may determine: Provided, however, That 
such amount shall be the amount of the overcharge or overcharges if the defendant proves that the violation of the regulation, 
order, or price schedule in question was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the 
occurrence of the violation.  50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, § 1895."
1370,33," .  Particularly did the City Court and the decisions following it overlook the statement in Kessler v. Fleming, 9 Cir., 1947, 163 
F.2d 464, at page 468: 'It is reasonably clear that Congress imposed the sanction as a measure of civil redress.  As observed in Crary v. Porter, 8 Cir., 
157 F.2d 410, 414, increased or multiple damages are not authorized to be assessed under § 205(e) of the Act as a substitute 
for criminal punishment. Criminal sanctions for violations are separately provided for in § 205(b) * * * Multiple or exemplary 
damages whose allowance depends upon the recovery of actual damages, have never, so far as we are aware been regarded 
as amounting to a criminal penalty.  The view that the treble damage sanction is remedial rather than punitive has been taken in 
other cases aside from Crary v. Porter, supra.'"
1370,34," .  Section 216(b), 29 U.S.C.A. provides: '(b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or 
employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, 
and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.  Action to recover such liability may be maintained in any court of "
1371,," competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly 
situated.  No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party 
and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.  The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment 
awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.'"
1371,35," .  This was pointed out by Judge Cardozo in United States v. Swift & Co., 1932, 286 U.S. 106, at page 114, 52 S.Ct. 460, at 
page 462, 76 L.Ed. 999: 'We are not doubtful of the power of a court of equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to changed conditions, though it was 
entered by consent * * *.  Power to modify the decree was reserved by its very terms, and so from the beginning went hand in 
hand with its restraints.  If the reservation had been omitted, power there still would be by force of principles inherent in the 
jurisdiction of the chancery.  A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as 
events may shape the need. * * * The result is all one whether the decree has been entered after litigation or by consent.' "
1374,36, . [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL]
1374,37," .  Since the Paramount suit was pending during the effective period of the Wartime Tolling Act (56 Stat. 781, amended 59 Stat. 
306, 15 U.S.C.A. 16 note) consideration of the applicability of this act to this suit is unnecessary."
1374,38," .  The ultimate issue presented at this separate trial is whether the claims pleaded are barred in toto as to each particular 
defendant.  Factual findings as to when the statute was tolled subsequent to September 1, 1935 have been made only because 
necessary to decision.  Whether any defendant may be held liable for wrongful acts committed within a specific period, be it of 
short or long duration, is reserved for later determination.  This must be so for I have concluded that the defense of the statute of

pure competition, information as to present and prospective conditions of supply and demand may be imperfect or unequally 
distributed; custom may restrain complete independence of action; friction may impede the movement of capital between 
industries, products, and firms; minor obstacles may limit access to and withdrawal from the field.  But other of the conditions of 
perfect competition must be preserved; commodities must be standardized; sellers and buyers must be numerous and small; no 
one of them may control enough of the supply or the demand appreciably to affect the price; each of them must take price as 
given and adjust his output or purchases to it. * * * Pure competition undoubtedly does exist, but its occurrence is comparatively 
rare."" Wilcox, Competition and Monopoly in American Industry, TNEC Monograph No. 21, p. 3 (1941)."

one were to ask any graduate student to define ""monopoly"", ""He may start by telling you that there is an element of monopoly in 
all trading, but he will probably not start with a definition of 'perfect' monopoly, which turns out, like perfect competition, to be 
nonexistent, or substantially so, outside Soviet Russia."" And see: Oppenheim, op. cit., p. 122, who points out that the ""perfect""

State of Nevada, and are sold and shipped in interstate commerce from said States to the State of Nevada for use there. '13.  Plumbing contractors in Southern Nevada are engaged in the business of distributing, selling and installing plumbing and 
heating supplies, and make a charge and obtain a profit both from the sale of said supplies and from their services in installing 
the same.  Over three-fourths of all plumbing and heating supplies used in Southern Nevada are distributed, sold and installed 
by plumbing contractors who are members of defendant Association and defendant Exchange and a major part of all said 
plumbing and heating supplies are distributed, sold and installed by defendant plumbing contractors. '14.  Manufacturers and wholesalers located in States other than the State of Nevada, sell and ship directly to plumbing 
contractors in Southern Nevada more than 40 per cent of all plumbing and heating supplies which are purchased by said 
plumbing contractors. '15.  The remainder of the plumbing and heating supplies purchased by said plumbing contractors are obtained from wholesalers 
located in Southern Nevada, who purchase plumbing and heating supplies from out-of-state sources for resale to said plumbing 
contractors and other customers.  Substantial quantities of plumbing and heating supplies are purchased from out-of-state 
sources by the said Southern Nevada wholesalers in response and pursuant to prior orders placed with said wholesalers by 
plumbing contractors and, upon receipt of said supplies from out-of-state sources, said supplies are immediately delivered to the 
plumbing contractors who ordered the same. '16.  Substantial quantities of plumbing and heating supplies are shipped from manufacturers, wholesalers or other sources 
outside of the State of Nevada, directly to the job site or place where the same are installed by plumbing contractors in Southern 
Nevada. '17.  Consumers of plumbing and heating supplies ordinarily do not install said supplies, and this service customarily is 
performed by a plumbing contractor, who employs and supervises skilled labor for this purpose.  The service performed by 
plumbing contractors in Southern Nevada, including defendant plumbing contractors, in distributing, selling and installing 
plumbing and heating supplies is an integral part of, and necessary to, the movement in interstate commerce of plumbing and 
heating supplies which are manufactured in States other than Nevada, and which are distributed, sold and installed in Southern 
Nevada.  Thus, plumbing contractors, including those named as defendants herein, are conduits through which plumbing and 
heating supplies manufactured in and shipped from States of the United States other than the State of Nevada, are sold and 
distributed to the consuming public in Southern Nevada.  Said plumbing and heating supplies flow in a continuous, uninterrupted 
stream from their points of origin in States other than Nevada, to their places of installation and use in buildings in Southern 
Nevada.' "

] The word 'affect' is used in two different situations under the antitrust laws.  A case under the antitrust laws, so far 
as the interstate commerce element is concerned may rest on one or both of two theories: (1) That the acts complained of, occurred within the flow of interstate commerce. This is generally referred to as the 'in 
commerce' theory. (2) That the acts complained of, occurred wholly on the state or local level, in intrastate commerce, but substantially affected 
interstate commerce. Under both of these theories, the transactions complained of must affect or have and effect on interstate commerce or the 
requirements of the statute are not satisfied.  Under the 'in commerce' theory, the ultimate effect on interstate commerce is the 
impact on that commerce under a qualitative and not a quantitative test.  If there is price fixing or division of the market involved, 
there are violations per se, as a matter of law. Where there is involved no price fixing or division of the market, the effect of the 
transactions complained of may be a question of law or a mixed question of law and fact. Turning to the second alternative, where acts wholly within intrastate commerce substantially affect interstate commerce, these 
intrastate acts may occur before goods enter the flow of commerce, or after they leave the flow of commerce. Here we have a 
question of fact as to whether the wholly intrastate acts substantially affect the flow of commerce. After determination of the issue as to whether the wholly intrastate acts substantially affect the flow of commerce, we then reach 
the same problem that is reached under the 'in commerce' theory, namely the ultimate effect or impact of the acts complained of 
on interstate commerce and again the test is a qualitative one and not a quantitative test, and again is a question of law, or a 
mixed question of law and fact. "
1615,4," .   United States v. Starlite Drive-In, Inc., 7 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 419, holds to the contrary, viz., that the 'effects' alleged are 
conclusions of law, but does not cite the Ninth Circuit case referred to in the text, United States v. Chrysler Corp. Parts 
Wholesalers. In view of the simplified pleading of the federal system, the Ninth Circuit ruling seems preferable. "
1616,5," .  In U.S. v. Detroit Sheet Metal & Roofing Contractors Ass'n, Inc., D.C. Mich. 1953, 116 F.Supp. 81, an indictment was held 
sufficient which alleged that intrastate activities affected interstate commerce. The facts alleged are similar to the instant case, in 
that it involved a Roofing Association, six building contractors and twelve individuals associated with nine corporate defendants. But see Howard v. Local 74, etc., (U.S. v. Employing Lathers Ass'n of Chicago and U.S. v. Employing Plasterers Ass'n of 
Chicago), D.C. Ill., 118 F.Supp. 387, where the District Court held indictments did not state an offense under the antitrust laws.  
The defendants were the associations, the Union and its officials.  The court held no effect on interstate commerce had been 
alleged and characterized the matters complained of as 'wholly a charge of local restraint and monopoly'. On Nov. 30, 1953, the U.S. Supreme Court noted probably jurisdiction in each of the cases, No. 439 and No. 440, respectively, 
on the Supreme Court's docket, and placed them on the summary calendar, 346 U.S. 894, 74 S.Ct. 227. "
1619,6," .  The court in the Ziegler case consisted of Mathews, Stephens, and Driver (District Judge).  The court in the Remmer case 
consisted of Mathews, Stephens and Orr.  The court in the Kobey case consisted of Mathews, Orr and Lemmon (District Judge).  
(Judge italicized wrote opinion) "
1620,7," .  'A combination may be in restraint of interstate trade and commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act even through 
(though) the restraint is applied before the interstate journey beings (begins) or after it has ended. 'Prices fixed in advance to effect a product at the end of its interstate journey are an interference with that commerce, although, 
at the time the sale is actually made, the product originating in interstate commerce may actually have come to rest on the shelf 
of the 'retailer.' It is the agreement on prices, in advance, which constitutes the violations, not the sale at the price. 'In assaying price-fixing agreements, the test is not so much whether the effect is felt after the movement of the goods has 
reached the end of the interstate journey.  The inquiry seeks the effect upon prices in the market.  And if this effect be shown, it 
matters not that the movement has come to a halt within the state.' "
1621,8," .  'The purpose, intent and necessary effect of the aforesaid combination and conspiracy has been and is to directly, 
unreasonably, arbitrarily and unlawfully restrain and obstruct the flow of plumbing and heating supplies in interstate commerce 
into Southern Nevada by: '(a) Suppressing and eliminating competition among plumbing contractors in the sale, distribution and installation of plumbing 
and heating supplies by fixing both the prices of the supplies sold and the prices charged for the subsequent installation of these 
supplies; '(b) Narrowing and restricting the market in which builders, owners and other consumers are able to purchase plumbing and

1622,9," .  'Violation per se' means that the acts complained of constitute a violation regardless of the alleged reasonableness of the 
restraint which is affected thereby or the facts which are offered in justification of the restraint.  As a matter of law the per se 
violation has an effect on commerce. 'Violation per se' does not mean (as the government contends) that the acts complained of, 
to-wit, a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market, automatically and illegally affect interstate commerce in a case where 
such intrastate activities are alleged to have an 'effect' on the interstate flow of commerce. This is a question of fact. "

1637,1," The corporate defendants are International Boxing Club of New York, Inc., International Boxing Club, and Madison Square 
Garden Corporation.  The individual defendants are James D. Norris and Arthur M. Wirtz.  The individual defendants, together 
with Madison Square Garden Corporation, own 80% of the stock of International Boxing Club of New York, Inc., and 
International Boxing Club.  The nature of the business involved is described in an appendix to this opinion."

] ""§ 1. . . . Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . .  Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1-7 of this title to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . . HN2[
] ""§ 2. . . . Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . ."" Section 4 confers jurisdiction on the district courts ""to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1-7 of this title"" in equity 
proceedings instituted under the direction of the Attorney General."
1637,3," The District Court's opinion was oral and not transcribed.  All the parties agree, however, that the dismissal was based on 
Federal Baseball and Toolson. "
1638,4," The complaint further alleges that ""With the progressive and continuing expansion of television facilities, the proportion of the 
promoter's total revenue derived from television, radio and motion pictures, has been on an ascending curve . . . ."" "

1658,3," 'The general principle announced in numerous cases is that a right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue, and directly 
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed in a subsequent suit between the 
same parties or their privies; and, even if the second suit is for a different cause of action, the right, question, or fact once so 
determined must, as between the same parties or their privies, be taken as conclusively established, so long as the judgment in 
the first suit remains unmodified.' Southern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 1897, 168 U.S. 1, 48, 18 S.Ct. 18, 27, 42 L.Ed. 355; 
to the same effect Partmar Corp. v. Paramount Pictures Theatres Corp., 1954, 347 U.S. 89, 74 S.Ct. 414, 98 L.Ed. 532; Becher 
v. Contoure Laboratories, Inc., 1929, 279 U.S. 388, 49 S.Ct. 356, 73 L.Ed. 752; United States v. Moser, 1924, 266 U.S. 236, 45 
S.Ct. 66, 69 L.Ed. 262. The quotation from the Becher case appearing in the majority opinion relates to the distinction between 
the competency of the state court to decide issues properly before it and its competency to declare a patent invalid.  The 
Supreme Court indicated only that, as to the first, the state court was competent and its decision conclusive on the federal court 
even though it would not have had the power to render a judgment declaring the patent invalid.  So here it would seem clear that 
the state court's decision of the anti-trust issue properly before it would be conclusive although undeniably it would not have had 
the power to entertain a treble damage action. "
1663,1," Rule 8(a), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., uses the words 'a claim for relief.' '* * * the plaintiff must plead a legal right and its 
violation,-which is what has always been denominated as a 'cause of action."" Sidebotham v. Robison, 9 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 
816, 831, cases collected. "
1664,2," The trial court filed a memorandum (unpublished) on sustaining a motion to dismiss the original complaint but granted leave to 
file the amended complaint, here considered.  Upon sustaining a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, the trial court 
adopted its memorandum previously filed when the original complaint was struck down. "
1665,3," How plaintiff may prove its damage, and the difficulties it may encounter are not now before us.  The cases relied on in the trial 
judge's memorandum:- Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. Railway Co., 1922, 260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183; Turner Glass 
Corp. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 7 Cor., 1949, 173 F.2d 49, and Northwestern Oil Co. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 7 Cir., 1943, 138 
F.2d 967,-stand for the rule that in actions brought under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, plaintiff's damages must be proved by 
facts from which their existence is logically and legally inferable and cannot be supplied by conjecture.  But see Bigelow v. RKO 
Radio Pictures, Inc., 1946, 327 U.S. 251, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652."
1665,4, See additional cases cited in note 6 of the Vines case. 
1666,5," We have quoted from a conclusion of law in the interest of brevity.  The findings of fact are to the same effect but more 
extensive. "
1667,6," See discussion pages 800-801.  The reported case concerned a motion to dismiss and it was held a cause of action was 
stated.  The case, on the trial, based essentially on the Robinson-Patman Act, resulted in judgment for defendants and is now on 
appeal. "

1696,19," The producers were aware of the adverse effect of television on attendance at motion-picture theatres. The investigation 
conducted by Stanford Research Institute in four typical western towns, the results of which were placed in the record, indicates 
that of the persons interviewed in what the investigators considered a typical urban area 79.4% consisted what they called the 
'common audience', i.e., persons who saw motion pictures and looked at television frequently.  The investigation disclosed that 
of this group 22.5% would not attend motion pictures if better quality feature films were shown on television. A companion chart 
in the record estimated that such a reduction in theatre attendance would have entailed a loss of 67.7 millions of dollars to 
producers and distributors for the year 1954.  This loss contrasts enormously with the amounts available for televising motion 
pictures in that year, --  21.9 million."

quotes with approval the following statement from Bertrand, Evans & Blanchard, The Motion Picture Industry, --  A Pattern of 
Control, 40-41 (TNEC Monograph No. 43, 1941): ""The establishment of clearance schedules is an intricate procedure.  It involves a complex bargaining process and the balance 
of a variety of opposing economic interests.  It may be stated initially that the primary objective of the distributor is, of course, to 
maximize his total revenue from each picture. This aim gives him a very direct interest in clearance periods.  The higher rental 
fees paid by the prior-run exhibitor are directly conditioned on the extent of the protection which he is granted, and in general the 
longer the clearance period before subsequent showing, the higher the rental fee the prior-run exhibitor will pay. ""On the other hand, the distributor's revenue from subsequent-run exhibition is also important to him; this income may mean the 
difference between black or red ink on his ledgers.  But the longer the clearance period, the smaller will be these returns --  not 
only because more customers will have attended the prior showing rather than wait for subsequent exhibition, but also because 
the effects of the advertising and exploitation efforts made when the picture was released will have been vitiated over this time.  
In general, the greater the total box-office return earned by a film in all showings, the greater will be the distributor's revenue. * * 
* ""The relation between run, clearance and zoning, admission price, seating capacity, and rental fees is indeed a complex one.  
The range covered by these factors is indicated by this fact: a license fee amounting to many thousands of dollars may be paid "
1700,," for the first showing of a film in a large metropolitan theater, and within a year the same film may be exhibited in some small 
theater in the same city for a fee of less than $ 20."""

was taken off the fair-trade lists, Eastman continued to sell it at the same price, with no drop in volume. "

Fair Trade and the Art of Prestidigitation, 65 Yale L.J. 196 (1955); and see the footnote references therein to the enormous 
quantity of iiterature on the subject. "
1757,6," .  The claim that there was not 'fair and open competition' apparently was based upon an alleged monopoly, as the court said 
that the fact that plaintiff had a 'lion's share of the business does not indicate that one is not in fair and open competition.'"
1757,7," .  He might have wanted to read the story of the Flood, Genesis, chs. 7 and 8. This court is of course bound by the specific holding of the Maryland Court of Appeals.  Cf. Fulda, Resale Price Maintenance, 21 
U.Chicago L.Rev. 175, 197-198 (1954): 'Of particular interest, perhaps, are the decisions that copyrighted books must be treated 
like other commodities for purposes of fair trade in spite of the fact that a reader who wishes to buy The Grapes of Wrath will not 
likely be content with Ferdinand the Bull'; with which this court concurs, and also doubts if the would-be purchaser of Schnitzler's 
Casanova's Homecoming would settle for Hardy's The Return of the Native."
1757,8," .  Those who wished to hear the William Tell Overture could do so; whether under the baton of a leader of a symphony 
orchestra, or as 'rendered' by Spike Jones. "
1760,8," A. Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp., 1936, 299 U.S. 183, 57 S.Ct. 139, 144, 81 L.Ed. 109; General 
Electric Co. v. Home Utilities Co., D.C.D.Md.1955, 131 F.Supp. 838, affirmed per curiam, 4 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 384; Revere 
Camera Co. v. Masters Mail Order Co., D.C.D.Md.1955, 128 F.Supp. 457, 460."
1760,9," .  As more fully discussed in section (c) infra, the primary attempted justification for fair-trading the package is the claim that the 
purchaser relies upon the implicit guaranty 'that the quality of the article in question is the same as previous articles which bore 
the same mark.'"
1760,10," .  Note: Fair Trade Acts --  In General --  Package Containing Non-Fair-Traded Items cannot be Fair-traded, 69 Harv.L.Rev. 
385 (1955); Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp., 1936, 299 U.S. 183, 193, 57 S.Ct. 139, 144, 81 L.Ed. 
109: 'The primary aim of the law is to protect the property --  namely, the good will --  of the producer, which he still owns.  The price 
restriction is adopted as an appropriate means to that perfectly legitimate end, and not as an end in itself.'"
1760,11," .  The Goody case upheld the fair-trading of trademarked long-playing records although the standard 78 r.p.m. records were 
not fair-traded. The decision was based upon the theory that the Fair Trade Laws gave the producer an independent choice as 
to each product.  The Klein case cites Goody, and sees 'no warrant for a contrary view in any provision of the statute.' (121 
N.Y.S.2d at page 48). "
1761,12," .  This portion of opinion approved in Harvard Law Review Note, supra, Note 10."
1761,13," .  The injunction was denied because of the 'close factual question' as to whether plaintiff had abandoned its fair-trade policy by 
granting a New York agency to Ritz Camera Center, which had a store in the District of Columbia (which has no Fair Trade Law) 
and which it was alleged regularly sold plaintiff's products in Washington, D.C., and accepted and filled mail orders for the sale of 
such products, at prices below plaintiff's established fair-trade prices. This court is advised that the case was tried on the merits in April 1955 and fully briefed; no decision had been announced when 
this opinion was filed.  For the decision therein see Eastman Kodak Co. v. Siegel, Sup., 150 N.Y.S.2d 99. "
1762,14," .  The cost of the outfits is greater by 1 cents-48 cents than the cost of the items purchased separately. No figures were given 
as to the cost of manufacturing the cardboard carrier, which is not fair-traded, and is not sold as an independent item."
1762,15," .  This may in fact be Eastman's concept.  It does not fair-trade its flash holders, because for at least some months after a new 
Eastman camera is placed on the market, only Eastman flash holders will fit it, and they are accordingly not in free and open 
competition. But the testimony was that outfits containing such new cameras and flash holders were placed upon the fair-trade 
lists as soon as marketed."
1762,16," .  Are the bottles of liquors in a Christmas hamper any different from what they were before the package was assembled; and 
do they regain their pristine character when removed, unopened, from the hamper?"
1762,17," .   Eastman Kodak Co. v. Siegel, d/b/a Tower Photo Shop, 1955, 207 Misc. 986, 140 N.Y.S.2d 260, at page 262, Steuer, J.: 'It would seem that an abandonment could only be spelled out if plaintiff is permitting or consenting to an arrangement whereby 
the article can be sold in reality below the fair trade contract price. In this connection no objection can be seen to combining 
articles in a single offer providing all of them are products of the seller's manufacture trademarked by him and meet the 
requirements of being in free competition.  The fact that the fair trade price for the combination of articles is less than the total of 
the fair trade prices for the articles individually is not significant.'"
1762,18," .  See Guerlain, Inc., v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 1947, 297 N.Y. 11, 74 N.E.2d 217, at page 218, that for a 'new commodity' the 
'very form and character of the basic product (must be) altered'; 'a new article, possessing a completely different function', must 
be created. "
1763,19," .  So far as the effect of the inclusion of products of other manufacturers is concerned, the opinion of Steuer, J., in the same 
case, 1955, 207 Misc. 986, 140 N.Y.S.2d 260, 262, supra, note 17, appears to be in accord. The suggested analogy to radio and television sets in Note 69 Harv.L.Rev. 385-386 would not seem apt.  Few people would buy 
a chassis, transformers, condensers and picture tubes separately, and attempt to make a radio or television set; just as very few 
would buy the component parts of an automobile, and expect to 'manufacture' the finished product."
1763,20," .  The evidence disclosed that plaintiff allowed its employees a discount on plaintiff's products.  Defendant has made no point of 
this, possibly because of the language in Schill v. Remington-Putnam Book Company, 1941, 179 Md. 83, at page 95, 17 
A.2d 175, at page 181, 22 A.2d 129, approving certain contractual exceptions, not including employee discounts, and saying: '* 
* * It does not appear that the Fair Trade Act precludes exemptions from the contract contemplated by its provisions, and we can 
see no logical objection to reasonable exemptions agreed upon by the parties to the contract', and General Electric Co. v. S. 
Klein-on-the-Square, Sup.1953, 121 N.Y.S2d 37, 49, but to the contrary, see Bristol-Myers Co. v. L. Bamberger & Co., 1937, 
122 N.J.Eq. 559, 195 A. 625, affirmed on opinion below, 1938, 124 N.J.Eq. 235, 1 A.2d 332. "
