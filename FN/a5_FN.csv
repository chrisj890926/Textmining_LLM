26,5," .  Existence of the necessary tying elements was not found in the Times-Picayune case.  If in that case defendant newspaper 
publisher had required by contract provision the purchasers of advertising space to subscribe to defendant's papers, prices and 
service being equal to that of competing papers, with substantiality satisfied, the illegality per se of the requirement could hardly 
be doubted. The postulated situation is more analogous to the present case than the facts found in Times-Picayune. "

existence of the following leases containing traffic clauses, all valid and subsisting as of 1949, the year in which suit was 
commenced: (1) At least 1,000 leases involving more than 1,000,000 acres of grazing lands.  (See Response to Request IV.) (2) At least 16 leases of iron ore land, covering 5,261 acres. (See Response to Request VII.) (3) At least 2 leases of coal lands.  (See Response to Request VI.) (4) At least 19 oil and gas permits or leases, covering 135,000 acres of land. (See Response to Request V.) In addition, defendants admit the existence of the following contracts for the sale of timber or timberland subject to traffic 
clauses: (1) Out of 75 contracts for the sale of timberland, involving over 2,000,000 acres of land and over 21,000,000,000 board feet of 
timber, at least 42 of such contracts were subject to traffic clauses.  (See Response to Request I and Exhibit A.) (2) Out of 210 timber contracts, involving more than 390,000 acres of land and more than 6,000,000,000 board feet of timber, at 
least 157 of such contracts included traffic clauses.  (See Response to Request II and Exhibit B.)"

66,4," The court below in its opinion, reported at 105 F.Supp. 372, decided on motion to dismiss the complaint, that the patent 
monopoly had been misused by Newburgh in violation of the antitrust law.  The motion was based on the testimony contained 
in the deposition of September 17, 1951 of Hans Holterhoff, the Treasurer of Newburgh.  Mr. Holterhoff, the son of August 
Holterhoff, the inventor of the process, stated: 'Where the pricing of each process of moires is concerned, they (the licensees) 
must abide by a minimum price list which is established by our firm.' The license agreements themselves have not been 
introduced in the record."
66,5," The court below on the motion to dismiss assumed the validity of both patents in issue.  Our holding that Patent No --  145 is 
valid places the case in the same posture in this court on the issue of antitrust law violation as it was in the court below."

minimum or stipulated prices, or requiring a vendee to enter into contracts or agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated 
prices, for the resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or container of which bears, the trade-mark, brand, or name of the 
producer or distributor of such commodity and which is in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class 
produced or distributed by others, when contracts or agreements of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate 
transactions under any statute, law, or public policy now or hereafter in effect in any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia 
in which such resale is to be made, or to which the commodity is to be transported for such resale. '(3) Nothing contained in this section or in any of the Antitrust Acts shall render unlawful the exercise or the enforcement of any 
right or right of action created by any statute, law, or public policy now or hereafter in effect in any State, Territory, or the District 
of Columbia, which in substance provides that willfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale, or selling any commodity at 
less than the price or prices prescribed in such contracts or agreements whether the person so advertising, offering for sale, or 
selling is or is not a party to such a contract or agreement, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person 
damaged thereby.'"
103,4," Its weakness from a realistic point of view is highlighted by the fact that here more than two-thirds of defendant's sales were 
made over the counter in its extensive three-story store in the District, while the remaining or mail-order sales were by no means 
limited to New York customers; witness the two federal cases in Maryland that we have cited which also involve this defendant. "

107,1," This phrase was separable from the provisions of the Cole Amendment providing for a federal cause of action. Being so 
separable, it could easily have been inserted in the McGuire Act which leaves enforcement to the several states. It is a fair 
conclusion, therefore, that in situations where the transaction is in interstate commerce Congress did not intend to permit the 
state in which the goods are delivered to be able to enforce its local resale price maintenance statute. "
109,1," Masters Mail Order of Washington, D.C. did most of its business in across the counter sales, but I think that that is immaterial 
to the issues before us since our concern is only with the substantial mail-order sales to the New York market."
109,2," Stress on title passage seems to me to be particularly unfortunate for that would allow even a wholly in-state retailer to evade 
his state's fair trade law when selling to an out-of-state consumer by merely arranging that title pass in a free-trade state with 
some relevant contacts."
109,3," Bissell Carpet Sweeper Co. v. Masters Mail Order Co. of Washington, D.C., D.C.Md.1956, 140 F.Supp. 165, affirmed 4 Cir., 
1957, 240 F.2d 684, Does not seem to me to be persuasive authority for a contrary result as to the McGuire Act since that dealt 
primarily with the Maryland statute. Nor is the decision of much assistance in construing the Feld-Crawford Act, for despite the 
similarity of language between the Maryland and New York acts, the New York legislature and the New York courts have already 
firmly indicated an intent to protect the home market as much as possible. See Raxor Corp. v. Goody, 1954, 307 N.Y. 229, 120 
N.E.2d 802 certiorari denied, 1954, 348 U.S. 863, 75 S.Ct. 88, 99 L.Ed. 680 and Eastman Kodak Co. v. Masters, Inc., Sup.1956, 
153 N.Y.S.2d 433. Moreover, in Bissell we do not have the many contacts by the seller with the fair trade state which make the 
transactions before us sales in New York for all practical purposes. "
113,1," Indicative of the wide acceptance of the mark and its identification with the plaintiff's product is the fact that in one of the last 
scenes of the play 'No Time For Sergeants', which had over a year's run in New York and is now presented under the auspices 
of the Theatre Guild by traveling companies throughout the country, one of the high-ranking officers asks, 'Who has the 
Dramamine?' "
116,2," The Fair Trade Agreement called 'Manufacturer-Wholesaler Contract' contained these clauses: 'Whereas, the Manufacturer is the producer or the distributor of various commodities and the Wholesaler is engaged in the sale 
of such commodities at wholesale in various states which have enacted fair trade acts, and the Manufacturer and the Wholesaler 
desire to avail themselves of the provisions of such fair trade acts and of the fair trade acts of such other states as shall enact 
such statutes; 'Now, Therefore, in consideration of the premises, and the mutual benefits and obligations accruing to and assumed by the 
parties hereto from and by the execution and delivery of this agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: * * * '2. The Wholesaler will not (except as specifically permitted by statute) directly or indirectly, advertise, offer for sale or sell any of 
the Products to any buyer in any state in which at the time of such sale a fair trade act shall be in effect at less than the minimum 
wholesale selling price at that time stipulated therefor in such state by the Manufacturer. '3. The minimum wholesale selling prices stipulated by the Manufacturer for the Products in various states are those now or 
hereafter designated in Schedule A plus, in each sale, the amount of all sales and excise taxes applicable to such sale. "
117,," 'The Manufacturer, at any time and from time to time by written notice given to the Wholesaler as hereinafter provided, may (a) 
eliminate one or more Products from Schedule A; (b) add one or more Products to Schedule A and stipulate minimum wholesale 
selling prices therefore; and/or (c) change the minimum wholesale selling price of any one or more of the Products. 'Each elimination from and each addition to Schedule A and each change in any minimum wholesale selling price, including 
each such change made pursuant to Article 4 of this agreement, shall be effective at the opening of business on the date 
specified in the notice thereof, and such notice (which may take the form of a revised Schedule A which specifies its effective 
date) shall be mailed so that, in the ordinary course of the mails, it will be received by the Wholesaler before the date so 
specified. '4. In the event that, pursuant to any agreement similar to this one, the Manufacturer shall stipulate a minimum wholesale selling 
price for any of the Products in any given state which shall be different from the minimum wholesale selling price at the time 
stipulated for such products in such state under this agreement, the Manufacturer will give prompt written notice of such fact to 
the Wholesaler and such different minimum wholesale selling price shall be effective under this agreement as provided in Article 
3 hereof.'"
117,3," The general form of agreement entitled 'Manufacturer-Wholesaler Agreement' and entered into between Searle and the 
wholesale druggists in the Los Angeles area contained this clause relating to drop shipments: '7. We will allow you a handling discount of 10% (based upon our quotation) on drop shipments of Searle Tablets in Bulk 
Packages Only to any accredited hospital, physician or established clinic which orders such shipments through you. In the case 
of institutions which are city, county or state controlled, this handling discount arrangement extends to drop shipments of Any 
Searle Item or Package Size. Under no circumstances will we allow a handling discount on Federal Government business.' "

plaintiff is the same and is claimed to have damaged each of the plaintiffs in the same manner, plaintiffs may join under 
Rule 20(a) or maintain the suit as a spurious class suit under Rule 23(a)(3), though the judgments are several and no one 
is bound unless he is present.' (At page 742. Emphasis added.) A later case from the same circuit approves the principle that separate judgments must be entered: 'Here we are dealing with a spurious class action, containing common elements of fact and law, but based upon separate 
and individual claims growing out of the same transaction.  Hughes v. Encyclopedia Britannica, 7 Cir., 199 F.2d 295; Kainz

although the remaining requisites of the true class action must be met.  Their joinder is a matter of economy and efficiency on 
the part of courts and parties -- an avoidance of a multiplicity of suits. Courts have possessed the power to afford and have 
afforded this remedy long before the adoption of the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The joinder was and is a matter of

275,2," .  In March, 1955, the most extensive study of the automobile industry ever conducted by Congress was begun by a 
subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. After nine months of background study, hearings 
began on January 19, 1956, and ran until June 21, 1956.  See: Hearings, Before the Subcommittee on Automobile Marketing 
Practices, the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, United States Senate, 84th Cong., 2nd Sess.; Senate Report 
No. 1879, 'Bigness and Concentration of Economic Power --  A Case Study of General Motors Corporation,' 84th Cong., 2nd 
Sess.  Out of these investigations first came 'The Automobile Marketing 'Fair Play' Bill,' S. 3946, 84th Cong., 2nd Sess., a bill 
which sought to outlaw (among other things) as unfair methods of competition and as unfair acts or practices in commerce, (1) 
the inducement by means of coercion, intimidation, or discrimination, of dealers to accept for delivery any product of any kind, 
and (2) cancellation of a dealer's franchise without his consent, unless the franchise agreement contained mutually agreed upon 
standards by reference to which the duties and obligations of the dealer might be determined.  See: Senate Report No. 2791, 
84th Cong., 2nd Sess.  This proposed statute was to have become part of the Federal Trade Commission Act and to have been 
enforced by the F.T.C.  The bill passed the Senate at the end of the 84th Congress, but was never acted upon by the House of 
Representatives. Enacted into law, however, was the less detailed 'Automobile Dealer's Day in Court' act, which took effect on August 8, 1956, 
and which was sponsored by Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney, of Wyoming.  See: Senate Report No. 2073, 84th Cong., 2nd 
Sess.  This statute permits a dealer to sue an automobile manufacturer for damages sustained by failure of the manufacturer to 
act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the terms or provisions of the dealer's franchise, or in terminating, 
cancelling, or not renewing the franchise with the dealer. The essential term, 'good faith,' is defined in the act as imposing upon 
each party to the franchise the duty 'to act in a fair and equitable manner toward each other so as to guarantee the one party 
freedom from coercion, intimidation, or threats of coercion or intimidation from the other party'; the definition adds the further 
proviso, however, 'That recommendation, endorsement, exposition, pursuasion, urging or argument shall not be deemed to 
constitute a lack of good faith,' 15 U.S.C.A. (1957 Supp.), Sec. 1221 et seq. "

288,2," .  The brokerage may be paid by Conference members in accordance with the following rules adopted pursuant to the basic 
agreements. 'Rule 10 of the Conference Tariff No. 11: Brokerage. Freight brokerage not to exceed 1 1/4% of the amount of freight may be 
allowed only to bona fide brokers whose actual business shall be brokerage and freight between ocean carriers and general 
shipping public; a broker whose business is maintained directly or indirectly by a shipper or consignee for the purpose of 
handling his business exclusively shall not be deemed a bona fide broker; freight brokerage shall be paid only on the following 
understanding which shall be written or stamped on all brokerage bills: ""In compliance with Section 16 of the Shipping Act, 1916, payment by the carrier and the acceptance of freight brokerage by the 
broker are on the strict understanding that no part of the brokerage shall revert to the shipper or consignee, and that the 
business of the broker is in no sense subsidiary to that of the shipper or consignee.' 'Note: --  Act Canadian Ports 'In compliance with Section 16 of the Shipping Act, 1916' shall be deleted.' "
289,3," .  AUT was advised by Lloyd, which carried the great bulk of the freight, on June 12, 1952, that the so-called brokerage 
attempted to be charged would not be paid by Lloyd on any shipments since this would mean that the Brazilian Government 
would be paying brokerage on shipments 'they would normally handle as they have been handled in the past.' There is no 
evidence justifying the claim that Lloyd as a matter of fact took this action as a result of the June 12, 1952, meeting.  In fact the 
evidence is to the contrary."

291,6," .  It seems perfectly clear, as held by both the examiner and the Board, that the action of the Conference at the June 12, 1952, 
meeting, without its submission to and approval by the Board, was a violation of § 15 of the Act.  The Conference vote, it may 
plausibly be argued, reflected an agreement designed to punish AUT for its action in bidding against the Conference.  The 
Conference members, prior to the June 12, 1952, meeting, had paid brokerage to forwarder-brokers where such persons had 
been merely 'identified with the cargo,' and the action of that date was obviously a modification of an existing agreement and 
required under 15 to be filed with the Board for approval before becoming effective.  See Pacific Westbound Conference v. Leval 
& Co., 1954, 201 Or. 390, 269 P.2d 541. "

therefore, no conclusive presumption of illegality.' "
314,1," .  In this connection we said: 'This brings us at last to the final point in the case, whether the district judge was right in dismissing the amended complaint for 
failure to sufficiently allege fraudulent concealment. Without setting out the allegations, because of their great length, we think it 
quite clear that plaintiffs' amended complaint does well state their claim, that by secretly moving under the guise and protection 
of the public interest and through the public authorities, the defendants fraudulently intended to and did conceal the scheme and 
their participation in it, and that the defendants' effort to meet this pleading by invoking judicial notice of matters which they call 
to our attention in their briefs, will not at all do.  It may well be that the facts are better pleaded than they can or will be proved.  
The matters to which appellees seek to call our attention may prove the Achilles heel in, and the death wound to, plaintiffs' case 
before the jury, but these are not matters which arose on the face of their pleading or in any other proper way below, and we 
may not consider them in passing on the ruling under review.  Their claim of blissful ignorance may suffer also before the jury 
from their admissions in their pleadings that Ball's antipathy, indeed enmity, to them, was of long standing and had been long 
known to them, as it may with the jury open a breach in their defense of fraudulent concealment, but these and all other such 
matters are and must remain for the arbitrament of the jury and may not be adjudicated by the court.' 223 F.2d 238, 248. "
315,2," .  Since upon the trial of this one issue the existence of the conspiracy as charged is assumed, we shall hereafter refer to the 
conspiracy in that sense, although such reference in no way implies that there has been a finding that such a conspiracy did in 
fact exist."
315,3," .  We depart from the chronological statement of fact here to state that the fact that Main and Wheeler actually made 
representations to the Post Office Department was not known by appellants until December 27, 1946, within the period of three 
years from the filing of the suit.  This is agreed to by everybody.  It is in effect claimed by appellants to be the main support of 
their claim of lack of knowledge. "
316,4," .  This suit, too, was finally won by Crummer."
316,5," .  After stating that 'The duPont interests apparently concluded that they had to wage war if their selfish plans, dreams, etc. were 
to reach fruition on Crummer,' the statement also said: 'The duPont interests failed in their flight in the Florida Legislature for they were fighting not only Crummer but the people of the 
state; they failed in their fight against the enactment of the amendment to the Federal Municipal Bankruptcy Act, because of the 
overwhelming support urging its enactment; and they failed in their fights in the courts because the merits were against them. 'However, when the agents of the SEC and Post Office Department moved in and took over the front line of attack upon 
Crummer the course of the battle changed.  The potent forces of the Federal Government were too much for Crummer.  He was 
compelled to retreat.  And, as a result, for all practical purposes Crummer was eliminated as the prominent figure in the field of 
Florida public finances. Immediately the duPont interests assumed the position of prominence to such an extent that there now 
exists a duPont public credit monopoly in Florida.  For example: While Crummer was permitted to function in Florida the duPont 
interests were able in open competition to obtain not more than one-forth of the authorized refunding bonds, but, since "
317,," Crummer's elimination the duPont interests and associates have purchased about seventy five per cent of the volume authorized 
for which they tendered bids. 'I realize that the Department of Justice is not interested in the success or failure of competitors in any field of endeavor, but I am 
certain that it is extremely interested in determining whether or not its authority is being used by others as a vehicle to persecute 
one competitor at the behest of another, and especially where it appears that the competitors have entered into the same type of 
contract and only one, in the field of many, stands criminally charged.' "

352,2," It appears from the testimony of Herman Bloom, Vice President of the Margon Corporation, that prior to 1948, the defendant 
sold approximately 80% of the dolls' eyes.  It further appears from his testimony that subsequent to 1948, the defendant sold 
approximately 50% of the individual movable eyes.  This witness claimed that the individual movable eye was developed by his 
company.  Whether the defendant's dominance in the field was due to this or some other factor, the evidence does not disclose.  
He further testified that the competitors did not appear in the market until about 1952 or 1953.  A determination that the position 
of dominance was attained illegally would be based upon conjecture. "

staged during the 12 years immediately preceding 1949, 45% were held in New York City, of which 75% were in Madison "
390,," Square Garden.  The balance of the New York championship bouts, with one exception, were held in Yankee Stadium, the Polo 
Grounds, or St. Nicholas Arena."
390,4," Between 1937 and 1948, 50% of all championship contests were staged in either Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium, 
the Polo Grounds, St. Nicholas Arena, Chicago Stadium, Detroit Olympia Arena, or the St. Louis Arena."
390,5," At the time the I. B. C.'s were formed, Joe Louis owned 20% of the stock of each and the other 80% was split evenly between 
Norris and Wirtz on one hand and Madison Square Garden on the other.  At some point thereafter, Louis ceased to be a 
stockholder and his share was split evenly between Norris-Wirtz and Madison Square Garden.  At the time of the final decree, 
apparently as the result of an effort to make a showing of separateness of control, the Norris-Wirtz interests owned all of the 
stock in I. B. C., Illinois, and Madison Square Garden owned all of the stock in I. B. C., New York.  The trial court found that the

years, the trustees are ordered to sell it within the next two years. "
396,10," This provision of the decree, applying only to championship contests, ordered appellants to lease their respective buildings 
upon seasonable written request by a qualified promoter, if the proposed rent is reasonable, if the applicant furnishes adequate 
security, and if at the time of the application the building is neither already under lease to another for the specified day nor in 
conflict at that time with ""any well-established event"" which has been regularly conducted therein.  If the parties cannot agree on 
what constitutes adequate security or a reasonable rental, either party may apply to the court for a determination thereof. "
398,1," Apart from its divestiture and dissolution provisions, the decree imposes wide-ranging and pervasive restrictions on appellants' 
activities in boxing promotion and exhibition.  It renders void all exclusive contracts which they may presently have with boxers.  
It prohibits the making of new exclusive contracts, with the exception that, after five years, exclusive provision may be made for 
return bouts. Similarly, exclusive leases with stadia not owned by appellants are proscribed.  So, too, are such arrangements 
with television and radio broadcasters.  Further, appellants are restrained, for a period of five years, from promoting more than 
four championship boxing programs annually, two by Madison Square Garden and two, cumulatively, by Norris and Wirtz.  
During that five-year period also, the compulsory leasing provisions discussed in the Court's opinion are to be in effect.  Finally, 
the decree removes Norris and Wirtz as officers and directors of Madison Square Garden, and enjoins them from holding such 
positions in the future."

S. C. Section 18) might prevent Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department from taking any effective action in the event 
they concluded that possible violations of the anti-trust laws were involved."" (Emphasis by the Commissioner.) Commissioner 
Doerfer, joined by Commissioner Mack, responded that it was unnecessary to hold a hearing because the investigation had fully 
revealed the facts.  He concluded, however: ""It is difficult to see how approval of this exchange may effectively preclude other 
governmental agencies from examining into this or any other transaction of the network companies."" "

423,14," We recently explained the nature of the doctrine in  United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64: HN4[
] ""The doctrine of primary jurisdiction, like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, is concerned with 
promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties.  
'Exhaustion' applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is 
withheld until the administrative process has run its course.  'Primary jurisdiction,' on the other hand, applies where a claim is 
originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues 
which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case 
the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views."" "
424,15," See, generally, 3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, §§ 19.05, 19.06; Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction Reconsidered: The Anti-
Trust Laws, 102 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 577; Schwartz, Legal Restriction of Competition in the Regulated Industries: An Abdication of 
Judicial Responsibility,  67 Harv. L. Rev. 436; von Mehren, The Antitrust Laws and Regulated Industries: The Doctrine of 
Primary Jurisdiction,  67 Harv. L. Rev. 929."
424,16," This followed because, in the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis in  Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., supra, at 161, "". . . a 
combination of carriers to fix reasonable and non-discriminatory rates may be illegal."" This Court in  Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. 
Co., supra, took the position that shippers were entitled to have rates filed by carriers who were not parties to a conspiracy, even 
though the rates filed were the lowest which would be found to be reasonable.  The risk that future filings would be at the 
uppermost limits of the zone of reasonableness was too great, and damage from the conspiratorial filings was presumed to flow.  
Of course, when the agency is permitted to exempt from antitrust coverage rates filed cooperatively, the doctrine equally applies 
to an attack on the alleged conspiracy. United States Navigation Co. v.  Cunard S. S. Co., supra;  Far East Conference v. United 
States, supra. "
425,17," Under Title II, common carriers are required to furnish communications service on reasonable request and may charge only 
just and reasonable rates, § 201. Such carriers must file rates with the FCC, and can charge only the rates as filed, § 203. The 
Commission may hold hearings on the lawfulness of filed rates, § 204, and after hearings may itself set the applicable rate, § 
205. Cf.  49 U. S. C. § 15 et seq., 46 U. S. C. § 817. In view of this extensive regulation, Congress has provided that certain 
actions of telephone and telegraph companies may be exempted from the antitrust laws by the Commission, § 221 (a) and § 222 
(c)(1).  Cf.  49 U. S. C. §§ 5 (11), 5b (9) and 46 U. S. C. § 814. Such exemptions are, however, subject to review, see  Federal 
Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., 356 U.S. 481."
425,18," This conclusion is re-enforced by the Commission's disavowal of either the power or the desire to foreclose the Government 
from antitrust actions aimed at transactions which the Commission has licensed.  This position was taken both before the district 
judge below, and in a Supplemental Memorandum filed in this Court, page 8: ""Concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice to enforce the Sherman Act, the Commission, of course, has 
jurisdiction to designate license applications for hearing on public interest questions arising out of facts which might also 
constitute violations of the antitrust laws. This does not mean, however, that its action on these public interest questions of 
communications policy is a determination of the antitrust issues as such.  Thus, while the Commission may deny applications as 
not in the public interest where violations of the Sherman Act have been determined to exist, its approval of transactions which 
might involve Sherman Act violations is not a determination that the Sherman Act has not been violated, and therefore cannot 
forestall the United States from subsequently bringing an antitrust suit challenging those transactions."" Nor was this position taken merely for the purposes of this litigation, for it has been the view of the Commission over a period of 
years.  See Report on Uniform Policy as to Violation by Applicants of Laws of United States, FCC Docket No. 9572 (1950), 1 
Pike and Fischer, Radio Regulation, Part III, 91:495; National Broadcasting Co. v.  United States, 319 U.S. 190. Since, as Mr. 
Justice Brandeis observed, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction rests in part upon the need for the skill of a ""body of experts,"" it 
would be odd to impose the doctrine when the experts deny the relevance of their skill. "

its gross receipts entirely from the sale of shoes. The 22,000 figure is determined as retail shoe stores having such percentage 
of sales. The six firms' percentages of nation's total retail shoe store operation for 1956: International Shoe, the nation's largest shoe manufacturer (but one of the 13 largest firms above considered) had only 0.5% of 
the nation's total."

each, per year.  The 6 largest ranged from 126.1 to 266.8 million each, per year.  The smallest of these 12 had 16.4 million

stated: 'Similarly, the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the honest 
conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone, including 
du Pont's competitors, does not defeat the Government's right to relief.  It is not requisite to proof of a violation of § 7 to show 
that restraint or monopoly was intended.' See also Bethlehem Steel, supra, 168 F.Supp. loc. cit. 617. "

procure legislative and executive action is contrary to public policy and illegal.  Marshall v. Baltimore & O. Railroad Co., 1853, 16

503,3," .  The attempt to influence legislation and executive action while rightly held by the trial court to be less important than the direct 
vilification of the long haul trucking industry was nevertheless properly found to be a vital element of the defendants' conspiracy 
to injure and/or destroy that group.  Even assuming the brazen interference with legislation and executive action in this instance 
was lawful, its entire motivation was shown to emanate from the conspiracy charged.  It was part of defendants' scheme to 
wreck their competitor, to monopolize that branch of commerce for themselves.  As such it violated the Sherman Act. Giboney v. 
Empire Storage & Ice Co., 1949, 336 U.S. 490, 497-502, 69 S.Ct. 684, 93 L.Ed. 834; United States v. Krasnov,

Railway Co. v. Aircoach Transport Association, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 253 F.2d 877, 887. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 1909, 213 U.S. 347, 29 S.Ct. 511, 53 L.Ed. 826, urged below and here by the 
Railroads, has no real application to the facts before us.  The later decisions of the Supreme Court in United States v. Sisal 
Sales Corporation, 1927, 274 U.S. 268, 47 S.Ct. 592, 71 L.Ed. 1042, and Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 1952, 344 U.S. 280, 73 
S.Ct. 252, 97 L.Ed. 252 clearly indicate that the Banana Company opinion is limited to the proposition that the Sherman Act 
cannot be invoked against persuading a foreign sovereign to act.  Okefenokee Rural Electric Membership Corp. v. Florida Power 
& Light Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 413, is the other decision stressed by the Railroads in the district court and on appeal.  That 
too is hardly an authority for anything pertinent under the instant unescapable facts.  There the complaint made no allegation 
that the conspiracy was directed to ruining a competitor in his business.  The later case of Crummer Co. v. Du Pont, 5 Cir., 1955, 
223 F.2d 238 and 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 425, certiorari denied 1958, 358 U.S. 884, 79 S.Ct. 119, 3 L.Ed.2d 113, leaves no 
doubt but that as of now in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, HN1[
] a conspiracy to drive a competitor out of business is a 
violation of the Sherman Act even though, as in Crummer, its most important element was the obtainment of its objective by 
secretly moving under the guise and protection of the public interest and through the public authorities. "

504,3," .  A typical example is supplied by Senate Bill No. 615, Session of 1951 of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, referred to 
from time to time in the testimony as the 'Big Truck Bill', caused to be introduced by the Truckers, which would have raised the 
permissible weight limits of heavy trucks from 45,000 to 60,000 pounds.  The defendants procured the veto of this bill by 
Governor Fine.  A somewhat similar bill, also proposed by the Truckers, was 'Bill A-13) in the New Jersey Legislature.  Similar 
legislation was also before the legislatures of New York and Ohio.  I shall not detail the various bills in the various State 
legislatures involved.  These are set out in full, with many allied matters, in the opinions of the court below.  See 155 F.Supp. 
768, and opinion on damages, 166 F.Supp. 163, 166. "
505,4," .  It should be noted that neither the opinion of the court below, 155 F.Supp. 768, nor that of this court, pinpoints whether the 
action is sustained under Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act."
505,5," .  The complaint alleges a conspiracy to create a monopoly. See paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of the complaint.  I assume therefore 
that the action at bar was one brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act but I make no point of any deficiency in pleading as 
will appear from this opinion in the discussion of the applicability of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the 'restraint of trade' section."
505,6," .  Proof in the record aside, the court below and this court are entitled to take judicial notice that the Railroads have not driven 
the Truckers out of business."
505,7," .  The circumstances are peculiarly unfitted for the maintenance of a Section 2 case.  We do not have before us a situation 
where one corporation, or even a few corporations, attempt to eliminate all competition so that it, or they will be left with 
unbridled power over prices, output, and entry into the competitive field.  An entire section of what may be called the 
'transportation industry' consisting of many railroads is accused of trying to eliminate another section of the transportation 
industry, the Truckers, a situation that as far as research indicates has never previously resulted in successful antitrust litigation.  
Even if the Railroads had actually eliminated the Truckers' competition completely the Railroads' position would be far different 
than that of the successful monopolist since there still would be competition among the various railroads. Further-more the 
interstate ground transportation industry is a regulated industry, with almost every phase of its activity controlled by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission. "

508,15," .  Parenthetically, the court below reached, to me at least, the unsual result that the counterclaims asserted by the Railroads 
against the Truckers could not be maintained though the counterclaims allege acts of substantially the same character and 
nature as those of the Railroads and Byoir upon which judgment here is based.  It is true that the Railroads conceded that the 
counterclaims are without merit.  This concession was, I think, a necessary one.  My view is based on the conclusion expressed 
in this opinion that the Truckers have not proved a cause of action under the Sherman Act. But the court below held that the 
Truckers' attempts at favorable legislation were permissible because they were attempting to procure laws that would better their 
competitive positions in relation to the Railroads. The court explains that the legislation sought would have permitted the 
Truckers to enter fields previously closed to them and that therefore no violation of the antitrust laws was involved.  But business 
gained by interstate truckers of necessity would be at the expense of interstate railroads. Moreover the position of the court 
below in respect to the counterclaims not stating a valid and proved cause of action overlooks the 'good will theory' advanced by 
the court itself as the basis for its judgment.  That there were attacks made by the Truckers on the good will of the Railroads is 
indubitable and the court below so found.  See 155 F.Supp. at page 803. The distinction attempted to be made by the court is "
509,," too subtle for me to grasp.  It seems to be based on the theory that under the Sherman Act what is one competitor's meat may 
be another competitor's poison."
509,16, .  See 155 F.Supp. at pages 826-829.
509,17," .  It should be observed that the court below effected legislation for it requires the Railroads and Byoir not to publicize material 
relating to the Truckers 'without disclosing their (own) participation', See paragraph 'IV-(6)' of the final decree.  I would conclude 
that this alone would require modification of the form of the injunction entered by the court below and approved by this court.  Cf.  
N.A.A.C.P. v. State of Alabama, 1958, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488, in which the Supreme Court 
interdicted the prohibition of 'privacy in group association'. "
510,18," .  The court below stated: '* * * (A) real private injury to the truckers was accomplished.  There was definitely a loss of good will 
to the trucking industry and in some instances that loss of good will was extreme.' 155 F.Supp. at page 810 ('Summary')."
510,19," .  The court stated: 'The use of the term 'good will' * * * relates not only to the direct damage done to the truckers, i.e., the 
refusal of truck users, because of the campaign, to avail themselves of that form of transportation (loss of business), but refers 
also to the more subtle type of injury done the entire trucking industry by discrediting it in the eyes of the general public, the 99% 
users of the highways, and eliminating the likelihood of public appreciation of the trucking industry as such or sympathy with the 
truckers' position which would be fundamental in gaining general public support to avoid the imposition of crippling burdens and 
restrictions.' 155 F.Supp. at pages 810-811 ('Summary')."
510,20," .  Section 3 of the Stipulation is as follows: 'The only damages claimed by the plaintiffs (except plaintiff Pennsylvania Motor 
Truck Association) are those that each of them may have suffered because of its inability to carry more than the weight limits 
fixed by the laws of Pennsylvania prior to the change in the law in 1955.' "
511,," The court took the position that the section of the stipulation quoted limited the money value of the Truckers' claims but not the 
nature of their claims.  This was an erroneous interpretation of the stipulation.  The Truckers called to testify conceded that their 
respective businesses had been harmed only by the legislative action or inaction that the Railroads and Byoir had effected. At 
pretrial conference it was stipulated that the Truckers who had not testified as to this issue would give similar evidence.  
Following this agreement the stipulation set out in Section 3, supra, was entered into.  The distinction made by the court 
between the nature of the damage and the scope of the damage money-wise is invalid and also does violence to the intent of 
the parties."

524,3," During the negotiations, Minneapolis first offered $ 69.50, and later $ 80, per share for the stock. On April 15, 1955, the Santa 
Fe and Pennsylvania each obtained letter commitments from the trustees for the sale to each of them of 26% of the Western 
stock at a price of $ 100 per share. (Near the same time the Rock Island made a like offer to the trustees for 26% of the Western 
stock, but that offer was not accepted.) But a dispute arose -- and apparently still exists between the trustees and Pennsylvania -
- with respect to the validity of those commitments.  Thereupon, Minneapolis offered the trustees $ 133 per share for the 
Western stock, but that offer was not accepted, and on May 26, 1955, the Santa Fe, acting, as the Commission found, ""on behalf 
of that carrier alone,"" agreed with the trustees for the sale by the latter and purchase by the former of all the Western stock held 
by the trustees at a price of $ 135 per share, and those parties on that date entered into a contract, accordingly, subject to 
approval of the Commission."
524,4," The contract of June 28, 1955, between the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania Company provided that it was without prejudice to 
any claims, causes of action or rights which Pennsylvania may have against the trustees of the McNear estate with respect to 
the letter commitment of April 15, 1955, for the sale by the trustees to Pennsylvania of 26% of the Western stock; and that, in the 
event Pennsylvania should acquire from the trustees, under that letter commitment, all or any part of such shares, the obligation 
of the Santa Fe under the contract to sell Western shares to the Pennsylvania Company was to be reduced accordingly.  It 
appears that litigation was then, and is yet, pending by Pennsylvania against the trustees for the enforcement of the letter 
commitment of April 15, 1955. The contract also contained a covenant which, in essence, provided that (1) Western ""will continue to be operated as a separate 
and independent carrier with responsible management located along its lines in order to preserve to shippers and communities 
the present direct access to its officials,"" (2) that Western's properties will be maintained and improved, (3) that Western ""will

interests of"" Western, (4) that all ""existing routes and channels of trade via [Western] will be maintained and kept open without 
discrimination between connecting lines of railroad,"" and (5) that the Board of Directors of Western shall consist of 11 members,

illegal, contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or container 
of which bears, the trade mark, brand, or name of the producer or distributor of such commodity and which is in free and open 
competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others, when contracts or agreements of that

] 'Section 3 of the Clayton Act, by its express terms, covers only leases, sales, or contracts actually made on the 
condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods of a competitor of 
the lessor or seller. There is nothing whatever in the Act to suggest that it covers a situation where the manufacturer refuses to 
make a sale or enter into a contract, and it has been stated time and again that a manufacturer has the unquestioned right to 
refuse to deal with anyone for reasons sufficient to himself.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 
L.Ed. 992; United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., 252 U.S. 85, 40 S.Ct. 251, 64 L.Ed. 471; Frey & Son v. Cudahy Packing Co.,

matter, a review of all of the cases decided by the Supreme Court involving Section 3 of the Clayton Act, reveals that in each of 
them there was an agreement and not a mere refusal to deal.  (Footnote 1- Cases cited.) There is a real difference between the 
act of refusing to deal and the execution of a contract which prevents a person from dealing with another.  The plaintiff has not 
been injured as the result of a contract, either express or implied, which sought to prevent him from dealing in the goods of any 
competitor of the defendant.' "

554,1," The pertinent provision of Sections 1, 3 and 4 of the Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended (15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 3, 4), 
commonly known as the Sherman Act, are as follows: HN1[
] ""Sec. 1.  Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal . . . .  Every person who shall make any

this act; and it shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direction of the

circumstances to make price-fixing agreements with purchasers, such agreements shall not be held illegal under the Sherman

556,4," When Parke Davis learned from a wholesaler's invoice that he had filled an order of one of the retailers, Parke Davis protested 
but was satisfied when the wholesaler explained that this was an oversight. "
557,5," Except that in December 1957, Parke Davis informed Dart Drug Company that it did not intend to have any further dealings 
with Dart.  The latter has, however, continued to purchase Parke Davis products from wholesalers. Thus, Dart Drug cannot 
receive the volume discount on large quantity purchases. "
560,6," Indeed, if Peoples resumed adherence to the Parke Davis price scale after the interview between its vice-president and Parke 
Davis' assistant branch manager, p. 34, supra, shows that Parke Davis and Peoples entered into a price maintenance 
agreement, express, tacit or implied, such agreement violated the Sherman Act without regard to any wholesalers' participation. "

and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses."" "
565,4," The District Court found, among other things, that the efforts of Parke Davis in the District of Columbia and Virginia came about 
only after some of its competitors had engaged in damaging local ""deep price cutting"" on Parke Davis products (Fdg. 12); that 
Parke Davis' sales in those areas constituted less than 5% of the total pharmaceutical sales therein (Fdg. 3); that these efforts 
followed the legal advice previously given by the Company's counsel (Fdg. 12); that Parke Davis did not have ""any regularized 
or systematic machinery for maintaining its suggested minimum prices as to either retailers or wholesalers"" (Fdg. 10); that the 
entire episode lasted only from July to the fall of 1956, when the Company ""in good faith"" abandoned all further such efforts 
(Fdgs. 12, 27); and that since that time retailers in these areas ""have continuously sold and advertised Parke, Davis products at 
cut prices, and have been able to obtain those products from both the wholesalers and/or Parke, Davis itself."" (Fdg. 27.)"
565,5," It may be observed that the facts found by the District Court militate more strongly against violation of the Sherman Act than 
those which formed the basis of the charge held erroneous by this Court in  Cudahy, 256 U.S., at 210-211. Although the Court 
now repudiates what was said in Cudahy in this respect, I submit that there is nothing in Beech-Nut, Bausch & Lomb, or any 
other case in this Court which justifies this. "

590,1," The California policy of course differs from policies of states with different statutory provisions.  Twenty states have ""right-to-
work"" laws that prohibit union security contracts.  (See dissenting opinion herein, footnote 7.) Ten other states have statutes 
specifically requiring that union security contracts be supported by a majority vote of the employees directly involved.  These 
states, all except Hawaii cited in footnote 4 of the dissenting opinion herein, include Colorado (Rev. Stats. § 80-5-6 (c), requiring 
approval of three-quarters); Connecticut (Gen. Stats. § 31-105 (5), 31-106(a)); Hawaii (1959 Session Laws, Act. 210, p. 141); 
Idaho (Code, § 44-107, 1959 Supp.); Kansas (Gen. Stat. § 44-809 (4), also included in the 20 states with ""right-to-work"" laws 
and not counted in these ten); Massachusetts (Ann. Laws, ch. 150A, §§ 4(3) and 5); Michigan (Stat. Ann. § 17. 454 (15)); 
Minnesota (Stat. Ann. §§ 179.12 (3), 179.16 (1); New York (Laws Ann. ch. 31, §§ 704 (5) 705); Pennsylvania (Stats. Ann. tit. 43, 
§§ 211.6 (1) (c), 211.7 (a)); and Wisconsin (Stat. Ann. § 111.06 (1) (c)). Six states not otherwise accounted for and having only a 
provision more or less similar to section 923 of the California Labor Code reach a result contrary to that of Shafer v. Registered 
Pharmacists Union, supra. (Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, Washington and Wyoming.  See cases cited in footnote 4 of 
the dissenting opinion herein.) Of the remaining thirteen states, six have no specific statutes and of these three (New Mexico, 
Rhode Island, and West Virginia) support the majority view in this case while three (Ohio, Illinois, and perhaps New Hampshire) 
support the dissent's view.  (See footnotes 6 and 8 of dissenting opinion herein.  The New Hampshire case is unclear as to 
whether the union had majority support.  That it had some support from the employees is clear.  [White Mt. Freezer Co. v. 
Murphy] 78 N.H. 398 [101 A. 357, 358].) Of the remaining seven states, six apparently have not passed on the point (Alaska, 
Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Montana); and one (Oregon) has repealed its labor relations statute and not yet 
enacted another (Ore. Laws, 1959, ch. 55, § 1).  Thus, nine states without special statutes are opposed to the California 
position. "

594,2," Familiar rules for the guidance of a reviewing court in passing upon the question whether the evidence supports the 
determination of the trier of fact that the situation presented to him does or does not constitute a law-defined operative fact (e.g., 
in Petri, the employer's interference with a union; in the next quoted opinion, an injury ""arising out of and in the course of 
employment"") are stated in Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. (1947), 330 U.S. 469, 477-478 [67 S.Ct. 801, 806-807, 91 L.Ed. 
1028], as follows: ""In determining [whether the legally operative ultimate fact existed, the trier of fact] . . . must necessarily draw 
an inference from what he has found to be the basic facts.  . . .  If supported by evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the . . 
. inference [of the operative fact by the finder] . . . is conclusive.  No reviewing court can then set aside that inference because 
the opposite one is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by the court because of a 
belief that the one chosen by the [finder] . . . is factually questionable.  [Citations.] ""It matters not that the basic facts from which the [finder] . . . draws this inference are undisputed rather than controverted.  
[Citation.] It is likewise immaterial that the facts permit the drawing of diverse inferences.  The [trier of fact] . . . alone is charged 
with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not 
be disturbed by a reviewing court.  [Citation.] Moreover, the fact that the inference . . . involves an application of a broad 
statutory term or phrase to a specific set of facts gives rise to no greater scope of judicial review.  [Citations.] Even if such an 
inference be considered more legal than factual in nature, the reviewing court's function is exhausted when it becomes evident 
that the [finder's] . . . choice has substantial roots in the evidence and is not forbidden by the law."" The foregoing rules are normally recognized and followed by this court as well as the high federal court.  ( Hamilton v. Pacific 
Elec. Ry. Co. (1939), 12 Cal.2d 598, 602 [5] [86 P.2d 829].) "
595,3," The fact that the Petri opinion was filed less than nine months after Chavez brings to mind the protests of Mr. Justice Roberts in 
Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co. (1944), 321 U.S. 96, 112-113 [64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561]: ""The evil resulting from overruling 
earlier considered decisions must be evident.  In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the 
law as clearly announced by this court.  If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to 
govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them.  Counsel and parties will bring 
and prosecute actions in the teeth of the decisions that such actions are not maintainable on the not improbable chance that the 
asserted rule will be thrown overboard.  Defendants will not know whether to litigate or to settle for they will have no assurance 
that a declared rule will be followed.  But the more deplorable consequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will 
fall into disrepute."" And again in Smith v. Allwright (1944), 321 U.S. 649, 666, 669 [64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987, 151 A.L.R. 1110]: 
The ""policy of the court freely to disregard and to overrule considered decisions . . . indicates an intolerance for what those who 
have composed this court in the past have conscientiously and deliberately concluded, and involves an assumption that 
knowledge and wisdom reside in us which was denied to our predecessors.  . . . ""The reason for my concern is that the instant decision, overruling that announced about nine years ago, tends to bring 
adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only."" "

work"" statute: A closed or union shop was a lawful object of picketing where the picketing union represented a majority of the 
employes ( Hotel & Restaurant Employees v. Greenwood (1947), 249 Ala. 265 [30 So.2d 696, 703 [12], 705 [17]]), but picketing 
for such object by a minority union could be enjoined ( Klibanoff v. Tri-Cities Retail Cl. Union (1953), 258 Ala. 479 [64 So.2d 393,

compel an employer to enter into an ""all-union contract"" after a majority of his employes had voted against union representation; 
by executing such a contract the employer would have committed the unfair labor practices of interfering with employes' right to 
organize or remain unorganized (§ 80-5-6(1)(a)) and encouraging or discouraging membership in a labor organization, except 
where the employer enters into an ""all-union"" agreement as authorized by the provisions (§ 80-5-6(a)(c)) of the comprehensive "

Teamsters Union v. Vogt, Inc. (1957), 354 U.S. 284, 294 [77 S.Ct. 1166, 1 L.Ed.2d 1347]. Wisconsin's comprehensive 
Employment Peace Act provides (Stat. Ann., § 111.06(2)(b)) that it is an unfair labor practice and against public policy for an 
employe individually or in concert with others ""To coerce . . . any employer to interfere with any of his employes in the enjoyment 
of their legal rights, including those guaranteed by section 111.04""; the latter section guarantees to employes the right of self-
organization, collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing, concerted lawful activity, and the right to 
refrain from any such activities. Wyoming: Hagen v. Culinary Workers Alliance Local No. 337 (1952), 70 Wyo. 165 [246 P.2d 778, 788 [6]], applying the 
Wyoming ""Little Norris-LaGuardia Act,"" W.C.S., § 54-501, like the Indiana and Washington statutes, supra."
598,5," Arizona (also has a ""right-to-work"" law): Rev. Stat. Ann., ch. 8, § 23-1322: ""It shall be unlawful for any labor organization to 
picket any establishment unless there exists between the employer and the majority of employees of such establishment a bona 
fide dispute regarding wages or working conditions."" Colorado: Section 6(2)(e) of the Labor Peace Act (Rev. Stats., ch. 80, art. 5, §§ 1-22) made a strike vote by a majority of the 
employes of the subject employer a condition precedent of picketing, and section 7(2) provided that the strike vote be taken ""as 
is provided in this act."" These sections were held inoperative because the only provision in ""this act"" for a strike vote was in 
section 20, which in turn was held unconstitutional because it required incorporation of unions.  ( American Federation of Labor 
v. Reilly (1944), 113 Colo. 90 [155 P.2d 145, 150 [9, 10], 160 A.L.R. 873].) Hawaii: Rev. Laws, 1955, ch. 90, is a comprehensive Employment Relations Act.  Section 90-8(e) provides that it is an unfair 
labor practice for an employe ""To cooperate in engaging in, promoting or inducing picketing (not constituting an exercise of 
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech) . . . unless a majority in a collective bargaining unit of the employees of an 
employer against whom such acts are primarily directed have voted by secret ballot to call a strike."" Minnesota: Stat. Ann., § 179.11(4) provides that it is an unfair labor practice ""For any person to picket or cause to be picketed a 
place of employment of which place the person is not an employee while a strike is in progress affecting the place of "
599,," employment, unless the majority of persons engaged in picketing the place of employment at these times are employees of the 
place of employment."" Montana has a rather unusual statute (Rev. Code Ann., § 41-1801; L. 1959, ch. 160, § 1) which provides that ""a sole proprietor 
or a member of a partnership consisting of not more than two partners who own a retail or amusement establishment and the 
members of his immediate family shall have the right to do any work in his place of business without interference by any union or 
any member thereof."" Oregon: Rev. Stats., 1953, ch. 662, §§ .610 through .790, a comprehensive labor code, specifically provides (§ .750) that ""It 
shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to . . . coerce . . . any employee in the exercise of said employee's free 
choice in selecting or rejecting a labor organization as the representative of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining, 
or . . . to coerce . . . any employer or employee because employees of said employer . . . have not selected a labor organization 
as their representative for said purpose.  The word 'coerce' includes picketing."" The constitutionality of this provision was upheld 
in Gilbertson v. Culinary Alliance & Bartenders' Union (1955), 204 Ore. 326 [282 P.2d 632, 652-653 [15-18]]. Pennsylvania: The state Labor Relations Act (Act of 1947, No. 484) provided that it is a union unfair labor practice for a labor 
organization or employes ""To picket or cause to be picketed a place of employment by a person . . . who is not . . . an employee 
. . . of the place of employment."" (Purdon's Stats. Ann., tit. 43, § 211.6(2)(d).) This statute was held an unconstitutional restraint 
on freedom of speech because its broad prohibition of picketing by nonemployes ""leaves room for no exceptions based upon the 
lawfulness of the purpose of the picketing, its peaceful character, or the circumstances that the picketers have a legitimate 
economic interest to advance thereby."" ( Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Chester & Del. etc. Union (1949), 361 Pa. 246 
[64 A.2d 834, 841 [3]].) Texas (which has a ""right-to-work"" law) also sought to narrowly restrict peaceful picketing by the following provisions of Vernon's 
Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5154f: ""It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to . . . participate in, aid or abet . . . secondary picketing . . . as 
those terms are defined herein""; i.e., ""the act of establishing a picket . . . near the premises of any employer where no labor 
dispute, as that term is defined in this Act, exists between such employer and his employees.  . . .  The term 'labor dispute' is 
limited to . . . any controversy between an employer and the majority of his employees concerning wages, hours or conditions of 
employment; provided that if any of the employees are members of a labor union, a controversy between such employer and a 
majority of the employees belonging to such union, concerning wages, hours or conditions of employment, shall be deemed, as 
to the employee members only of such union, a labor dispute within the meaning of this Act."" In International Union of 
Operating Engineers v. Cox (1949), 148 Tex. 42 [219 S.W.2d 787, 793 [10-12]], it was held that the foregoing statutory 
definitions were so narrow as to constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of free speech, but the right to impose reasonable 
restrictions on peaceful picketing was recognized. Wisconsin: Stat. Ann., § 111.06(2)(e), like the Hawaii statute, supra."

601,," Rhode Island: The comprehensive state Labor Relations Act, Gen. Laws, tit. 28, ch. 7 (P. L. 1941, ch. 1066) resembles the 
Wagner Act (pre-Taft-Hartley).  Section 28-7-2 thereof declares the public policy of self-organization and collective bargaining of 
employes through representatives of their own choosing ""free from the interference, restraint or coercion of their employers"" (§ 
1) and provides that the act shall not be construed to diminish the right of employes to engage in ""lawful, concerted activities."" 
According to Lindsey Tavern v. Hotel & Restaurant Employees (1956), 85 R.I. 61 [125 A.2d 207, 209, 210 [4]], recognitional 
picketing, ""unaccompanied by coercion, duress or intimidation, is lawful, . . . even if the picketing union represents no employees 
of the complainant."" West Virginia: Blossom Dairy Co. v. International Brotherhood (1942), 125 W.Va. 165 [23 S.E.2d 645, 649], where no statute is 
involved, holds (Syllabus 1 by the court, p. 646 of 23 S.E.2d) that ""Picketing of the place of business of an employer by a labor 
union will not be enjoined on the ground that it tends, or is intended, to cause the breach of a labor contract between such 
employer and another labor organization, when such picketing is not otherwise unlawful."" Nevada (prior to enactment in 1953 of a ""right-to-work"" law) may also be mentioned here: State ex rel.  Culinary v. Eighth 
Judicial District Court (1949), 66 Nev. 166 [207 P.2d 990, 996-998 [10-12]], upheld the legality of picketing by an outside union 
to compel a closed shop agreement under N.C.L., § 10473 (enacted 1911), which provided that ""It shall be unlawful for any 
person . . . to make . . . any agreement . . . by the terms of which any employee of such person, . . . or any person about to enter 
the employ of such person, . . . as a condition for continuing or obtaining such employment, shall promise or agree not to 
become or continue . . ., or . . . to become or continue a member of a labor organization,"" and N.C.L., § 2825.31 (approved 
1937), a statutory declaration of policy substantially identical with section 923 of our Labor Code."
601,9," Prior to its 1959 amendment section 8 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended (29 U.S.C. § 158), 
contained among the proscribed unfair labor practices (largely the same as those which, prior to the recent majority decision in 
the Petri Cleaners case were proscribed in California by Labor Code, section 923, and related sections) the following which are 
here pertinent: ""(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents: ""(1) to restrain or coerce (A) employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7 [i.e., rights to self-organization, to 
bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, etc., and also to refrain from such activities except as the 
latter right may be affected by a union security agreement as authorized in section 8(a)(3)] . . . ""(2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a)(3) [which 
provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to employment to encourage or discourage 
membership in any labor organization, except that the employer can enter into a union security agreement as authorized by the 
act] . . . ""(4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the 
course of their employment to . . . work on any . . . commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: . . . (C) 
forcing . . . any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of his employees if 
another labor organization has been certified . . ."""
601,10," The 1959 act adds a new union unfair labor practice to section 8(b); i.e., ""(7) to picket or cause to be picketed . . . any 
employer where an object thereof is forcing or requiring an employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the "
602,," representative of his employees . . . unless such labor organization is currently certified as the representative of such 
employees:"" (A) where the employer has lawfully recognized another union and a question concerning representation may not appropriately 
be raised under the act. (B) where a valid representation election has been conducted in the preceding 12 months. (C) where the picketing has been conducted without a representation petition being filed with the board ""within a reasonable 
period of time not to exceed thirty days from the commencement of such picketing,"" with some provisos. ""Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall be construed to permit any act which would otherwise be an unfair labor practice under this 
section (8)(b)."""
602,11," "" Section 13 provides: ""'Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or 
diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.' 61 Stat. 151, 29 U.S.C. § 163. ""Picketing has been equated with striking for the purposes of § 13.  [Citations.]"" "
603,12," The essence of the majority's holding (pp. 886-887, ante) is that ""the point of clause thirteen [of the demanded contract] is not 
price-fixing, but wage-fixing, and the presence of employer-barbers in the union does not convert the contract into an agreement 
between labor groups and non-labor groups for the purpose of restraining trade."" "
604,13," Among the provisions of the International's constitution are the following: Article III, section 1: ""The General Executive Board of the International Union is authorized to grant charters to local unions or 
employers' guilds . . . ""Sec. 3. In places where more than one union holds a charter, said unions and guilds shall form a joint committee to regulate 
prices, wages, hours of labor and other working conditions.  . . ."" Article VII, section 6: ""No Shop recognized as a union shop . . . shall permit the following unfair trade practices: . . .  4. The 
rendering of any service in the trade area thereof for less than the minimum prices established in said trade area . . . ""Sec. 11. . . .  Copies of the working agreement setting forth prices, wages and hours and other working conditions shall be 
signed by the owner or operator signing the Shop Card agreement . . . ""Sec. 12. The contract, or agreement, called for by these laws shall be so construed that the person . . . displaying the Shop 
Card shall specifically agree: . . .  (b) To abide by the laws of the local union . . . with reference to prices, hours, wages, and 
working conditions.  . . ."" Article XV, section 1. ""Every local union or guild may make its own by-laws, which must, however, be in accordance with this 
Constitution.  . . . ""Sec. 5. Every local union shall regulate the hours of labor, prices and wages in their respective locality . . ."" "
605,14," Pertinent here is the view taken by the NLRB in making a cease and desist order as to conduct which it determined was a 
Taft-Hartley-defined unfair labor practice, and by the United States Supreme Court in upholding the board's determination, in 
National Labor Relations Board v. Denver Bldg. & Const. Trades Council (1951), 341 U.S. 675, 688, 689 [71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 
1284]. The board found ""That an object, if not the only object, of what transpired"" was the proscribed unfair labor practice; the 
high court accepted this finding and held that ""It is not necessary to find that the sole object of the strike was that [proscribed by 
the national act]."" "

653,1," Greenberg's skill as a chemist is unquestioned. We have the chancellor's undisputed findings to the effect that Greenberg 
graduated from Temple University in 1939, having majored in chemistry, and received a degree of Master of Science from the 
University of Pennsylvania in 1940, his graduate studies being in analytical chemistry. In 1942 he studied organic chemistry at 
Johns Hopkins University. Since then he has been principally engaged in the maintenance and sanitation chemical industry as a 
chemist, having been employed by the Chemical Services Company of Baltimore, Maryland, and having operated his own 
businesses under the names of Janolyn and Knox Mfg. Company. The Chemical Service Company and Greenberg's own firms 
manufactured the same products, including liquid soap, floor finishes, and disinfectants, as are manufactured by Buckingham. In 
addition, of course, there is his tenure with Buckingham where Greenberg spent 50% of the eight odd years he worked for 
Buckingham duplicating and analyzing competitors' products."
653,2," The chancellor did not make any findings as to the origin of the formula for the disinfectant, nor could we discover any relevant 
testimony in the record on this point. HN1[
] The burden of establishing a trade secret is on the alleged owner.  Pittsburgh Cut Wire Co. v. Sufrin,  350 Pa. 31, 38 A. 2d 33 (1944); Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. v. Schnelbach,  239 Pa. 76, 86 Atl. 688 (1913). 
The source of the alleged trade secret is necessary to show both ownership and the state of secrecy of the formula from the 
trade in general. The comment to the Restatement, Torts, § 757, the general provision concerning trade secrets, provides: ""The 
HN2[
] subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry 
cannot be appropriated by one as his secret…. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular business in which it is 
used."" 4 Restatement, Torts, § 757, comment b (1939). The clear failure to meet their burden insofar as the source of the "
654,," disinfectant is concerned precludes appellees from relief as to that formula. Subsequent use of the word ""formula"" in the text, 
therefore, will apply only to the other formulas in issue, the cleaner formula and the two floor finish formulas, for which the 
appellees have made a prima facie showing of a trade secret."
654,3," While no specific finding was made by the chancellor that Greenberg developed the formulas in issue, the fact is clear by 
necessary implication from his other findings, as well as from the testimony of Greenberg himself and the admission of counsel 
for the appellees in his opening remarks to the court at the trial. The chancellor found that the formula for the cleaner was 
created between August 23, 1951, and January 3, 1952, while the formulas for the floor finishes were the results of a series of 
experiments and developments which began in March, 1954, and concluded on January 10, 1957. Greenberg was the chief 
chemist of Buckingham throughout this time, personally performing or directing all experimentation. The conclusion is 
inescapable therefore that Greenberg himself was responsible for the resulting formulas. Moreover, the record discloses that 
Greenberg, called as on cross-examination by the appellee, identified the handwriting in the Buckingham experimentation books 
which described the development of the floor finishes as his own. Appellees' apparent purpose was to show Greenberg's 
familiarity with the formulas by virtue of the fact that he himself conducted the experiments. "

property right derived from ownership of a trade secret, but instead found that the relationships between Extrin  and the 
individual defendant gave rise to this implied agreement of secrecy."
656,10," Said the court: ""In a case like this the nature of the employment impresses on the employee such a relationship of trust and 
confidence as estops him from claiming as his own property that which he has brought into being solely for the benefit, and at 
the express procurement, of his employer. The want of an express agreement that the ownership shall be in the employer is not 
fatal under such circumstances."" Wireless Specialty Apparatus Co. v. Mica Condenser Co., Ltd.,  239 Mass. 158, 131 N.E. 307, 
309 (1921). Then having found Wireless  to be the ""owner"" of the trade secrets, the court went on to enjoin the defendants, 
saying: ""Goodwin, upon leaving the plaintiff's employ, had a right to use his general knowledge, experience, memory and skill so "

that the relationship between the individual defendants and the Wireless Company,  that of being inventors ""wholly engaged in

person to use a price schedule or a price book in the regular course of his business, so long as the list is not used in fixing prices 
in restriction of competition.  However, when two or more business men agree upon the prices contained in a given price "

shippers.  In the main, the same cotton shippers that ship from the U.S. Gulf, ship from U.S. Pacific ports as well as Mexico and 
Central America.  From these areas, they ship to the Far East as well as North Europe, United Kingdom, Mediterranean, India, 
Canada, and South Africa.  To a great extent, what we do for them in one area affects what we get from them in another area 
and * * *. '* * * If you drop he freight rate at one point, immediately there is pressure to drop the rate at all other shipping points.  To avoid 
a continual whip-sawing of the rates, to the carriers' disadvantage, it is of vital importance to maintain the established 
differentials mentioned early in this report.' "

'The Court: Prior to the indictment? 'Mr. James: Prior to the indictment they did not do so.  They filed a motion for summary judgment subsequent to the indictment. 
In fact, I believe it was a grand jury indictment in that proceeding, yes.'"

the shipping industry conducted by the Antitrust Subcommittee of the House. * * * Mr. Celler, the Chairman of that Committee, 
transmitted to the Department of Justice and to the Federal Maritime Board, documents, which, in his opinion, consisted of

684,10," .  But what may be more important for purposes of this case, the court in the Riss case held that where it had an allegation of 
conspiracy (15 U.S.C.A.  § 1 et seq.) before it, that even 'if the Commission mission were to decide that the rate reduction, 
considered by itself, conformed to standards of the Interstate Commerce Act, it is nevertheless well settled that a lawful act may 
be validly alleged as forming a part of a conspiracy for an unlawful purpose, such as to restrain trade.' The court also stated at 
page 364, 'Thus, it is clear that the problem of whether or not a district court should refer certain issues to an administrative 
agency was not squarely before the court in the isbrandtsen case.'"

merely limiting the District Court's discretion to refer issues: 'It is the governing rule now that the issue of the intent and effect of 
a rate reduction, claimed to have been taken pursuant to procedures set forth in agreements approved by the Commission under 
Section 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act, must, in a case where such issue is the sole or dominant issue, first be referred to 
the Commission prior to a Court determination of whether such rate reduction violates the antitrust laws.' (170 F.Supp. 354) "

I think it is fair to say that we have not adequately done our job because of lack of personnel. Mr. Donohue.  In other words, you have not been investigating, or you have not been checking the activities of these different 
steamship lines, because you have not had the personnel to do the checking for you, is that correct? 'Mr. Morse.  We have not gone on what I may call fishing expeditions.  We have done checking where there have been 
complaints made.' "

oil company, or agree that they will not buy from a given company. 'The Chairman: That would not be subject to the act? 'Mr. Morse: No, sir.  It doesn't involve transportation. 'The Chairman. If they are not subject to the act --  perhaps your counsel might want to answer this --  would such an agreement 
as indicated by Chairman Morse be subject to the antitrust law? 'Mr. Aptaker (Board counsel): Yes, I believe that would be, because it is not in the area carved out from the antitrust laws.'"

compliance upon demonstrating a particular hardship.  Similar accommodation is available to the movants. Movants have been

from EOP at the going Sunkist price for such fruit at the time of delivery.  The processed product was sold by the independent 
processor under its own label or under the labels of its buyers. The independent was not required to pay for the fruit until such 
time as it had sold the processed products.  In the event the independent stopped buying fruit for its own account, either 
because of the price of fruit or because its capacity exceeded its own requirements for fruit, tis production facilities were to be 
made available to EOP upon request.  If EOP used such production facilities, the independent was paid costs of operation plus a 
guaranteed its costs of operation plus a guaranteed profit.  This provision of the fruit purchasing chasing contract ties in to the 
true processing or 'custom packing' contract which EOP sometimes had with the same independent processor. Finley characterized the so-called 'fruit purchasing' contracts With Hyland-Stanford and Mission Dry as providing for a 'deferred 
payment' or a 'credit plan,' since the independent processor was not required to pay for the fruit it purchased from EOP until the 
products processed therefrom were sold by the independent, even though the processed products were, at all times, the 
property of the independent.  Finley said that the provision in such contracts which required the purchaser to buy its full 
requirements of by-product oranges from EOP assured the independent of a dependable source of supply of fruit. He stated 
further that the deferred payment privilege afforded the independent under such contracts was given in exchange for the 
privilege given EOP for 'first call' on the independent's processing facilities. "

of all oranges and lemons grown in Southern California, so that isn't our problem.  It is what you find happened or did not 
happen from there on out. 'If they had this monopoly control of products oranges, then they could not use it illegally.  They could use it legally. Likewise, the 
plaintiff contends that the defendants conspired and combined to restrain trade and commerce, and conspired and combined to 
monopolize the citrus fruit market, which is something different from the product fruit. 'The question that is being left to you as jurors is not the question as to whether these co-operatives could have legally had a 
monopoly of all the oranges or lemons in California; there is no argument about that; the question on that phase of the case is 
whether or not, if plaintiff proves they did have such monopoly, did they use it legally or illegally.  This is a question of fact.  You 
are the sole judges of the facts. 'Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act have both the geographical and distributive significance and apply to any part of the 
United States as distinguished from the whole and to any part of the classes of the things forming a part of interstate commerce. 
If you find that either or both of the defendants combined with TreeSweet or Silzle to eliminate the comcitrus of the plaintiff in the 
market for citrus fruit juices, particularly single-strength Valencia juice processed in California and sold in interstate commerce, 
and that any of the acts charged to have been performed by such defendants were performed in furtherance of such 
combination or conspiracy, and that the performance of any such acts was the proximate cause of any damage to the plaintiff, 
you should find that there was a violation of the antitrust laws and proximate causation, and you should proceed to the question 
of damage. 'Any combination effectively excluding outsiders from the business altogether is a monopoly and is unconditionally unlawful. 'No claim or contention is made herein by the plaintiff that defendants, or either of them, attempted to monopolize. 'This may be a technical distinction.  There is a charge that they conspired to monopolize. That is different from an attempt to 
monopolize, to go back to those instructions that I gave you on conspiracy. Attempt to monopolize is something different.  For 
instance, one individual could attempt to monopolize, without any conspiracy. But there is no charge of attempt to monopolize. 'In considering the matter of monopoly power two ingredients are of outstanding significance: the power to fix prices and the 
power to exclude competition. 'The words 'to fix prices,' refer to price fixing activities which tamper with or affect price structures in interstate trade or 
commerce. 'Whether monopoly power existed in a defendant or defendants, and whether such power was illegally used or misused, is a 
question of fact for the jury.'"
743,23," .  'I charge you that the defendant Exchange Orange may legally enter into a processing contract whereby Valencia oranges 
furnished by Sunkist or Exchange Orange may be processed into single-strength orange juice for Sunkist by an independent 
processor party to such contract.  However, such processing contracts cannot be entered into by Exchange Orange as part of a 
combination or conspiracy which has the purpose or effect of fixing the prices at which single-strength Valencia juice processed 
by TreeSweet and Silzle for Exchange Orange may be sold or offered for sale by TreeSweet or Silzle in interstate commerce as 
such contracts would then be illegal contracts. "

juice in order to compare that with the finished product.  It is only possible to determine whether adulterants of that sort have 
been used by comparing an analysis made before (adulteration) and an analysis made after.' Appellees, apparently surprised at 
this offer of proof, did not dispute its accuracy, but its admissibility. "

771,2," .  A shopper, also known as a throwaway, is a newspaper containing principally advertising which is distributed free, and without 
request, at doorways."
771,3," .  In Massachusetts, Boston and Lynn are the only cities with more than one paper (excluding morning and evening by the same 
publisher).  This phenomenon, of course, is not restricted to Massachusetts.  See Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United 
States, 1953, 345 U.S. 594, 602-603 and note 13, 73 S.Ct. 872, 97 L.Ed. 1277."
771,4," .  An interesting speculation might be whether the antitrust laws were intended to protect one natural monopolist against 
another, in view of the fact that there was no competition before the battle began and there would be none afterwards.  Both 
parties flirt with this thought when the purpose serves.  Since these laws are concerned primarily with the public interest, 
Associated Press v. United States, 1945, 326 U.S. 1, 17, note 16, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013, rehearing denied 326 U.S. 802, 
66 S.Ct. 6, 90 L.Ed. 489; International Shoe Co. v. F.T.C., 1930, 280 U.S. 291, 298, 50 S.Ct. 89, 74 L.Ed. 431, it may be that 
they would not be involved if, for instance, the product provided by either party would be the same.  However, we cannot say 
that it could not be in the public interest to have one newspaper rather than another.  Where there is no identity of performance 
we will not say that the public does not have an interest in competition even though that competition be an elimination bout."
771,5," .  We agree with the court that the use of financial resources alone was not such an exercise of the Manchester 'monopoly 
power' in Haverhill as would imply an intent by Union Leader Wrongfully to exclude its competitor. Cf.  United States v. Griffith, 
supra, 334 U.S. at pages 107-109, 68 S.Ct. at pages 945-946. By the same token Union Leader's criticism of NNE's financial 
strength is ill-founded."
771,6," .  It is true that after the Journal became a daily these practices were discontinued.  But it must have already become apparent 
that the Journal was in the union's picket line.  Union Leader's present position may be illustrated by its argument that the 
shopper which was absorbing Gazette's advertising 'was not in the same market with the Gazette.' Almost as strained are its "
772,," contentions based on testimony that it is economically justifiable to advertise in only one of two competing papers.  This 
testimony fell far short of suggesting the reverse, that it was economically unjustifiable to advertise in both."
772,7," .  We expressly disclaim any approval of the court's citation of Allen Bradley Co. v. Local No. 3, International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, 1945, 325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939, rehearing denied 326 U.S. 803, 66 S.Ct. 11, 90 L.Ed. 
489. We are not required to decide whether the union violated the antitrust law, and so need not consider the very difficult 
problem of where labor's immunity to antitrust prosecution ceases."
772,8," .  The court expressly found that Union Leader did not come into Haverhill originally at the union's request.  Therefore, it might 
be questionable whether the joint appearance of union and Union Leader representatives put any pressure on an advertiser to 
use only the Journal beyond that which already existed from the mere coincidental facts that the Gazette was being struck and 
the Journal provided alternative newspaper advertising on a roughly equivalent basis.  But even if in fact it added no pressure, 
this would not undermine the court's finding that such pressure was wrongfully intended."
772,9," .  Union Leader describes these merchants as 'honor-bound to support it,' and states that it was 'prudent * * * to engage outside 
help' and that obtaining 'local advice * * * is so normal and much practiced in so many businesses that it has become a standard 
business technique.' Seemingly, the contention is that the court's finding that Loeb was paying for something more than proper 
advice was plainly wrong.  We have no inclination to agree."
772,10," .  The case comes before us after trial on all issues except damages.  The court accordingly made no finding as to what portion 
of this loss would have resulted simply from the strike without the competition to which this opinion is addressed.  We have no 
doubt that both contributed. "
773,11," .  We have examined the court's opinion in the light of the conflicting analyses made by the parties and agree with Gazette that 
the word 'compels' as used by the court indicated a ruling of law and not a finding or conclusion of fact."

932, 75 S.Ct. 334, 99 L.Ed. 731."
773,13," .  Nothing in the subsequent history of the Moore case, see note 12 supra, suggests Supreme Court disapproval of this. "
774,14," .  The case for Gazette here seems in some respects stronger than the one considered by Judge Phillips.  There the defendant 
was called upon to justify conduct which the statute expressly prohibited.  15 U.S.C.A. 13. In the present case the defendant 
merely has to rebut an inference of a wrongful intention drawn from particular actions."
774,15," .  Or, as Union Leader itself states in its brief with reference to this period, 'Gazette's financial condition was such that it could 
not continue much longer.'"
774,16," .  The practical necessity of Gazette's adjusting rates in order to maintain its position is made plain by Loeb's own testimony.  
He stated that 'this matter of the rates * * * goes to the very heart of any newspaper's survival.' Elsewhere he testified that a 
serious consequence of secret discriminatory advertising practices --  once it is known that they are indulged in --  is that it 
enables an unscrupulous advertiser to play one paper against the other.  A merchant who has not been offered a special rate-
cut by one paper can nonetheless tell the other that he has been, and that other, knowing the first paper does do such things, 
fears to disbelieve him, and must match the price in order not to lose the customer."
774,17," .  It is not clear whether the purpose of this finding was to bring NNE within the investment exception of section 7, infra note 18, 
but we think the previously quoted finding would preclude this. "

stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, he 
substantial lessening of competition. * * *' 15 U.S.C.A.  § 18."

precise purpose of the investigation is '* * * to determine whether Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc., or its predecessors, in connection with the offering for sale, sale and 
distribution of processed tomato products, by selling such products at unreasonably low prices with the purpose or intent of 
eliminating competition, have violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or by selling such products to different 
customers at discriminatory prices any by affording customers payments or compensations for facilities or services rendered in 
connection with sale of such products not afforded competing purchasers on proportionally equal terms, have violated Sections 
2(a) and 2(d) of the Clayton Act.'"

16, 1959) and with respect to Hunt's most populous Hunt and Snider Division sales and broker districts and ten of its largest 
chain store customers comprising approximately two thirds of Hunt's total sales of food products, the following documents be

thought it generally wise to restrict the operation of an act to its narrowest permissible compass.  However well these rules may 
serve at times to aid in deciphering legislative intent, they long have been subordinated to the doctrine that courts will construe 
the details of an act in conformity with its dominating general purpose, will read text in the light of context and will interpret the 
text so far as the meaning of the words fairly permits so as to carry out in particular cases the generally expressed legislative 
policy.' "

888,3," In the plaintiff's brief on appeal, it was argued: 'Presumably, what the Sullivan Company lost the defendants gained.' P. 9. "
889,," 'It is the impairment or destruction of a plaintiff's business and business opportunities that constitutes the wrong and is the basis 
for admeasuring his damages.  It is a reasonable inference that what the plaintiff in such an action lost the defendants 
measurably have gained.  Benefit to the defendants by way of increase of their trade is hoped for, or the conspiracy or 
combination would not be formed.  Benefit presumably results when the combination or conspiracy is successful.  It cannot be 
assumed, in a filed where an unlawful combination successfully operates to the detriment of its victims, that any large proportion 
of the business lost by the latter dissolves into thin air or fails to be acquired by the members of the combination.' P. 10. '* * * The nature of the cause of action is such tht the inference of benefit to the decedent's estate if well-nigh incontrovertible.' P. 
13. The court of appeals seems to have recognized and accepted these contentions."
889,4," The appeals court thus rejected the argument contained in the appellees' brief that: 'There is no allegation in the complaint that 
he [Pratt] derived any pecuniary benefit at the expense of the plaintiff, the alleged sufferer herein.' Appellees' brief, p. 2."
889,5," This action was ultimately settled and discontinued by stipulation dated March 18, 1942, and filed March 23, 1942, without

890,8," In arguing the assignability of a right of action under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, counsel for the appellant Hicks stated in his 
brief: 'Before leaving this point one other case must be noticed.  It was an action under the Sherman law in which it was sought to hold 
the personal representatives of a deceased defendant.  The reasoning of the opinion is rather hard to follow, but the court's 
conclusion to be gathered therefrom is that the cause of action survived because the plaintiff had suffered an injury to business.  
On this ground it is possibly authority for appellant.  Sullivan v. Associated Bill Posters, etc. (C.C.A.), 6 Fed.(2nd) 1000.' See 
Appellant's brief, p. 15."
890,9," The court further noted that since its decision was 'confined to an interpretation of the Jones Act, there is no need to consider 
the 'slender basis' for the general admiralty rule against such survivorship of actions.  See Just v. Chambers, 312 U.S. 383, 387, 
note 4 [61 S.Ct. 687, 85 L.Ed. 903].' 348 U.S. at page 210, 75 S.Ct. at page 244. "
892,10," The court's opinion is in error as to this latter point, viz., the failure of Judge Hand to allude to the United Copper Securities 
case in his opinion denying the motion for substitution. On the contrary, this case was in fact cited by Judge Hand as being 
consistent with the then existing law on the subject and in support of his decision to deny the motion.  See page 407. "
894,11," As for the law of New York, see Section 118 of the Decedent Estate Law, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 13: 'No cause of action 
for injury to person or property shall be lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury.' See also Commercial 
Solvents Corp. v. Jasspon, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1950, 10 F.R.D. 356; D.C., 92 F.Supp. 20. The language of the Supreme Court in Cox v. Roth, 1955, 348 U.S. 207, 75 S.Ct. 242, is in marked contrast to its earlier 
pronouncements in United States v. Daniel, 1848, 6 How. 11, 47 U.S. 11, 12 L.Ed. 323, and Patton v. Brady, 1902, 184 U.S. 
608, 22 S.Ct. 493, 46 L.Ed. 713, both of which adhered to the then orthodox common-law requirement for survival of actions, 
wrongful enrichment by a deceased tort-feasor derived at the expense of injury to or destruction of the sufferer's property.  Both 
cases were cited by Judge Hand in the district court's opinion in the Sullivan case.  See page 407. In Patton v. Brady, 1902, 184 U.S. 608, 614, 22 S.Ct. 493, 495, Mr. Justice Brewer observed: 'If we turn to the common law, 
there the rule was that if a party increased his own estate by wrongfully taking another's property an action against him would 
survive his death, and might be revived against his personal representative.' Earlier, in United States v. Daniel, 1848, 6 How. 11, 
13, 47 U.S. 11, 12 L.Ed. 323, Mr. Justice McLean had similarly applied the then prevailing common-law principle that 'if the 
person charged has secured no benefit to himself at the expense of the sufferer, the cause of action is said not to survive; but 
where, by means of the offence, property is acquired which benefits the testator, there an action for the value of the property 
shall survive against the executor.' "

898,2," .  It is clear that at least one of the reasons El Paso desired an asset merger was its belief that a Commission-approved 
acquisition of properties was less susceptible to attack under the antitrust laws than was a stock acquisition. El Paso's president 
testified that when merger was first considered by them they requested an opinion from their counsel on the antitrust implications 
of such a transaction.  The following colloquy took place later in the proceedings: '(Q.  By F.P.C. Staff Counsel.) And at the time were you concerned with the possibility of the Justice Department objecting?  (A.) 
Well, we wanted to do it that way, irrespective of the Justice Department, but it was perfectly apparent that from the standpoint of 
avoiding any possibility of trouble that was a better way to do it.' "
899,3," .  These took the form of an application by Pacific under Section 7(b) of the Act for permission to abandon facilities and services 
and an application by El Paso under Section 7(c) for a certificate approving acquisition of Pacific's facilities."
899,4," .  In both the November 8, 1956, stock exchange agreement and a proxy statement sent out to its shareholders shortly 
thereafter, El Paso represented that it had no present intention to merge the two companies or to acquire the assets of Pacific.  
According to testimony at the hearing these representations were made at the request of Pacific after the Internal Revenue 
Service had indicated that it would require such statements before ruling that the exchange would be tax-free to Pacific 
stockholders."
899,5," .  Pacific's application to abandon, see note 3, supra, was denied, on the ground that no abandonment of service would actually 
occur.  Instead, Pacific's certificates were rescinded and identical certificates were issued to El Paso. "
903,1," .  If it is not clear, as I think it is, that the acquisition of the assets of Pacific Northwest by El Paso was a consequence of the 
action taken by the United States under the antitrust laws, it is certain that the contrary also is not clear, and the truth of the 
matter should be determined. "

other dealer in the city of El Paso.  It is clear, we think, that these stipulations were well calculated to aid Houck & Dieter 
and their associates in effecting the purpose of the unlawful combination.  They gave the combination a monopoly of the 
sale in the city of El Paso of the product of the plaintiff's brewery, and materially assisted the parties to the illegal contract in 
carrying out their object of controlling the market for sale of beer in bulk in that city."" American Brewing Ass'n v. Woods (Tex. Comm. App. 1919) 215 S.W. 448, at 450: ""This statute clearly denounces as unlawful an agreement between any two or more persons, firms, corporations, or 
associations, who are engaged in buying or selling any article of merchandise, to refuse to sell to any other person any 
such article of merchandise, product, or commodity. This transaction falls literally within the language of the statute.  The 
brewing company was engaged in the sale of beer, and Woods was engaged in both the purchase and sale of beer, and 
the effect of the contract between them was that the brewing company should sell its products to Woods, and should refuse 
to sell to any other person at Orange.  We are not concerned with the policy of the law.  The courts must enforce it as 
written.  To hold in this case that the contract is not in violation of law is to permit the law to be violated with impunity, by 
designating as an agency that which is in fact a sale."" "

importance under § 1 of the Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 28 (no such certificate was filed in this case), and by 
providing for direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the decree of the trial court, whether composed of one or several judges,

this Court to hear an Expediting Act appeal from a District Court).  But Congress acted to keep such an important matter from 
going unreviewed, see H. R. Rep. No. 1317, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1944), and enacted a special statute, 58 Stat. 272, 15 U. S.

were allowed to retain the assets (not the stock) of one of the eight corporations whose stock they had acquired in violation of § 
7.  But probably acquisition of only one of those corporations' stock would not have been illegal.  The only clear exception in the 
courts is American Crystal Sugar Co. v.  Cuban-American Sugar Co., 152 F.Supp. 387 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1957), aff'd on the

970,6," A summary of the detailed provisions of the decree carrying out the direction and purposes of the court's opinion follows. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were enjoined from acquiring additional General Motors stock except as stock or rights might 
be distributed to them as stockholders by General Motors. "
971,," Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, on the one hand, and General Motors, on the other, were prohibited to have common 
officers, directors, or employees.  The former three were also restrained from nominating any person to be an officer or director 
of General Motors. Du Pont and General Motors were compelled to terminate, for as long as du Pont, Christiana, or Delaware own any General 
Motors stock, any agreement between them which (1) requires General Motors to purchase from du Pont a specified percentage 
of its requirements of any product (with certain time provisos), or (2) grants to either concern exclusive patent rights, or grants to 
du Pont preferential rights to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were restrained, for the same period, from entering into any joint business venture with 
General Motors and from knowingly holding stock in any business enterprise in which General Motors holds stock. The same 
restrictions were applied to General Motors. Du Pont was enjoined, again for the stock-holding period, from dealing with General Motors with respect to du Pont products on 
terms more favorable than those on which it is willing to deal with General Motors' competitors. The same restriction was placed 
upon General Motors in its dealings with du Pont. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, and their directors and officers, and the members of the families of their directors and 
officers who reside in the same household with them, were enjoined from exercising their voting rights in General Motors stock 
owned by them or allocable to them under the decree, and from attempting to influence anyone voting General Motors stock. The vote on the General Motors shares owned by du Pont was ordered ""passed through"" to the stockholders of du Pont (subject 
to the prohibitions of the preceding paragraph), and the notification and proxy machinery necessary to effectuate this provision 
was outlined.  Provision was made for the appointment of a monitor of these voting procedures. A procedure was established whereby du Pont and Christiana might sell or otherwise dispose of their General Motors stock. Two separate provisions preserved the right of any party to apply to the court for modification of the decree in the event of a 
change of circumstances (such as the advent of legislative tax relief) and for further orders necessary for carrying out the 
judgment. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were directed to obtain from their officers and directors, and their families, written consents to 
be bound by the voting restrictions of the judgment. For the purpose of securing compliance with the judgment, the Department of Justice was authorized to conduct reasonable 
inspections of the records and interviews with the employees of du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware and to apply to the court for 
similar privileges as to General Motors upon a showing of good cause."

accomplish this it may require the performance of conditions, may experiment to determine how best to accomplish its purpose, 
and may use either the negative or the positive form of decree."" Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed. 1941), § 109: ""Equitable remedies . . . are distinguished by their flexibility, their unlimited variety, their adaptability to circumstances, and the 
natural rules which govern their use.  There is in fact no limit to their variety and application; the court of equity has the power of 
devising its remedy and shaping it so as to fit the changing circumstances of every case and the complex relations of all the

976,15," This construction of the statute had long been settled.  See International Shoe Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 280 U.S. 291, 
297-298. ""Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as its terms and the nature of the remedy prescribed plainly suggest, was intended for the 
protection of the public against the evils which were supposed to flow from the undue lessening of competition. . . . . . . . ""Mere acquisition by one corporation of the stock of a competitor, even though it result in some lessening of competition, is not 
forbidden; the act deals only with such acquisitions as probably will result in lessening competition to a substantial degree . . . 
that is to say, to such a degree as will injuriously affect the public. . . ."" "

978,17," The Court should not allow itself to be led to a contrary conclusion by the language of  United States v. United States Gypsum 
Co., 340 U.S. 76, or Hartford-Empire Co. v.  United States, 324 U.S. 570. The Gypsum case says only that the District Court's 
conclusions should not be subject to reversal merely for gross abuse of discretion, and that this Court must intervene when the 
provisions of the decree are ""inappropriate."" I could not agree more, either with these views or with those expressed in the 
remarks that formed their preface: ""The determination of the scope of the decree to accomplish its purpose is peculiarly the responsibility of the trial court.  Its 
opportunity to know the record and to appraise the need for prohibitions or affirmative actions normally exceeds that of any 
reviewing court.""  340 U.S., at 89. In Hartford-Empire the opinion of the Court says ""it is unthinkable that Congress has entrusted the enforcement of a statute of 
such far-reaching importance to the judgment of a single judge, without review of the relief granted or denied by him.""  324 U.S., 
at 571. These words, if given the reading they seem most readily to bear, are certainly unobjectionable, for our power to review 
the antitrust relief determinations of trial judges is not in doubt.  If this language is to be read to authorize de novo consideration 
here of all the details of a lower court's decree, then it marks a real aberration in this branch of the law.  Whatever respect such a 
view might once have deserved, it deserves none now, for our recent decisions have uniformly adopted the principle of appellate 
deference to trial court discretion.  See cases cited in notes 7 and 16, supra. "

plaintiffs did not evidence an antitrust conspiracy on their part, but resulted rather from an independent exercise of business 
judgment by each defendant based on the Communist connections of plaintiffs and their consequent undesirability as associates 
for persons to whom good public relations were important.  I am willing to accept the proposition that proof of that kind is 
essential to defendants' case.  I cannot, however, accept the proposition that it is not available except in the mouth of the 
witness Biberman.  Indeed evidence of general repute of Communist association would be more valuable than even an 
admission by the witness of such association. 'Defendants have, therefore, failed to make out a case of essential and elsewhere unobtainable testimony refusal to give which 
would be ground for dismissal of plaintiffs' case.  Defendants' motion for an order directing plaintiffs to cause the witness to 
answer the questions will have to be denied since such an order would be futile. 'The question remains whether I ought to direct that the examination of Biberman proceed, and, if so, under what conditions.' Though lamenting the fact that the oral deposition was not completed and the motion to compel answer filed subsequent thereto, 
Judge Dimock directed the examination to continue as to those questions to which Biberman did not claim privilege and directed 
that certain costs be paid by defendants. "

1001,1," .  Sun divided Jacksonville into three sales territories.  McLean and seven other dealers were located in the territory consisting 
roughly of the north one-third of Duval County.  The examiner found that the pattern of traffic flow in this sales territory was such 
that motorists traveling from northern and northwestern Duval County to the downtown Jacksonville area had ready access to all 
of these stations."
1001,2," .  'Service stations today may be divided into five groups and the number in each roughly estimated as follows: (1) over 3,000 
owned by suppliers and run by salaried managers; (2) about 8,000 of the new and rapidly growing 'commission-type' stations run 
as independent businesses except that they buy their gasoline on consignment, thus giving the supplier control over prices; (3) 
some 90,000, more or less, which are leased by the supplier --  usually a refiner, but often a jobber and occasionally the owner 
of a chain of stations --  to the operator, subject to cancellation for unsatisfactory performance; (4) perhaps 15,000 or 20,000 
leased by the dealer from a third party; and (5) the remaining 60,000 or so which are on land and premises owned by the dealer 
himself.  Types (4) and (5) are the 'independent' or 'contract' stations whose operators merely buy their gasoline, and usually 
other products, on contract from their suppliers.' Whitney, 1 Antitrust Policies --  American Experience in Twenty Industries 125 
(Twentieth Century Fund, N.Y.1958)."
1001,3," .  The line between a 'major' and a 'non-major' oil company or 'independent' is not well-defined.  A major oil company is usually 
integrated in that it operates on the four functional levels of production, transportation, refining, and marketing. Generally, a non-
major does not own its refinery, or if it does, the refinery is usually small.  The non-major usually owns and operates its filling 
station. The off-brand gasoline a non-major sells has a lower octane rating than a name-brand gasoline. Super Test had an 
octane rating of 87.5 as against Sunoco's rating, in 1955, of 92.5.  There are about twenty vertically-integrated but not self-
contained majors. "
1002,4," .  'Private brands generally come to rest at a differential around 2 cents at retail below major brands.' de Chazeau and Kahn, 
Integration and Competition in the Petroleum Industry 466 (Yale U.Press, 1959).  In a case study of a price war in Philadelphia 
the author states, 'The Sun management believed that a branded gasoline could effectively compete with a non-branded 
gasoline which sold for only one to two cents less.' Comment, Competition in Gasoline Retailing: A Price War, 101 U. of 
Pa.L.Rev. 643, 645 (1953).  In the instant case the Sun official in charge of market research testified that it was not unusual to 
find markets where the differential is only one cent; that in a sub-normal market, such as a price war, the pattern has been for 
the majors to post prices within one cent of the non-majors. The examiner regarded this as evidence of predatory pricing to whip 
non-majors into line; Sun insists that the dealer posts whatever price he chooses, and that in a price war a dealer tries to protect 
himself by posting a price with a one cent differential. The determination of a sound differential is made more difficult when, as in the instant case, the non-major gives trading stamps. 
Sun officials regard such a practice as equivalent to a further reduction of one cent in the price of gasoline."

McLean's daily sales in February 1956, until he went out of business February 18, averaged about the same as January sales. On August 26, 1955, when Super Test's regular gas was posted at 26.9, its station sold 127 gallons plus 21 gallons from the 
truck pump; on August 27, when the price dropped to 21.9, the station sold 3,583 gallons plus 263 from the truck pump, and 
1324 of ethyl (at 23.9). On August 28, when the price was cut to 20.9 for the regular, Super Test sold 4931 gallons plus 278 from 
the truck pumps, and 1611 gallons of ethyl.  On August 29, when the Super Test price went up again to 26.9 and 28.9, the 
station sold 408 gallons of the regular plus 38 from the truck pump, and 137 gallons of ethyl."

to user may be almost continuous, the sequence of operations traditionally falls into a number of broad categories * * * Vertical "
1004,," integration occurs when the activities of a single company span two or more of these stages.' de Chazeau & Kahn, Integration 
and Competition in the Petroleum Industry, p. 19 (Yale U.Press, 1959). Vertical 'integration appears in many contexts'; it is 'the 
combination under single ownership of successive stages in a particular cycle of production.' Rostow, Entry into the Oil Refining 
Business; Vertical Integration, 61 Yale L.J. 856, 860, 878 (1952). For a comprehensive study of integration in the petroleum 
industry, in addition to de Chazeau and Kahn, see McLean and Haigh, The Growth of Integrated Oil Companies (Boston, 
Harvard Business School, 1954). 'During the 1920's the major oil companies expanded their direct operation of service stations; but retail price cutting after 1929 
began to reveal weaknesses in this policy.  Independent stations took business away from company stations because they could 
cut prices on shorter notice, with less risk of ill will, and without violating the Clayton Act or one-price laws in a number of states. 
Between 1933 and 1934 the number of stations owned by eighteen majors was reduced from 125,327 to 98,246, and by 1935 it 
was only 75,547.  The new factor which became effective in 1935 was Iowa's severe tax on chain stores, including stations. 
Standard of Indiana at once leased out to their operators all its stations in the state, and this 'Iowa plan' quickly spread to other 
refiners and other territories.  Besides escaping the chain store tax, which seven states had adopted at the end of 1939, the 
refiners were glad to be relieved of responsibility for service station employees, who were now being organized into unions and 
covered by social security and wage and hour legislation. 'The number of refiner-operated stations continued to decline, amounting to only about 3,000 (less than 2%) in 1956.  Although 
some majors still keep a core of salaried dealers, most of them have retained only a few selected locations to use as models or 
experimental and training plants, and for the profit of their concentrated, high-volume sales.' Whitney, 1 Antitrust Policies 125 
(1958).  Here, Sun's integration stopped short of retailing through company-owned stations."
1004,7," .  The letter, dated December 27, 1955, read, in accordance with a company form: 'Please be advised that I am confronted with 
a depressed retail gasoline price situation which has affected my business * * * In order to meet this competition, it will be 
necessary for me to sell Blue Sunoco gasoline at a retail service station price that is 1.8 cents per gallon above the posted 
dealer tankwagon price at which I now purchase same under my Dealer's Agreement. 'Therefore, I am requesting assistance from you to help me in meeting these competitive conditions.'"
1004,8," .  Sun's policy is to make certain that an operator grosses at least 3.5 cents a gallon. Sun considers this the minimum margin on 
which a dealer can exist.  3.5 is 1.3 cents less than McLean's usual profit of 4.8 cents.  Since McLean elected to reduce his 
posted price to 25.9 cents a gallon, a drop of 3 cents, it was requisite that the company allow 1.7 cents in order for him to gross 
3.5 cents. "

McLean to meet the competition of the Super-Test station across the street. Respondent would justify broadening the proviso of "

1007,18," .  In Enterprise the district court pointed out that the burden was on Texas Company to prove the price of its competing refiner. 
There was no evidence of such price and none that the Texas Company's prices were not lower than its competitors. Further, 
there was no evidence that the prices of the competitors were lawful prices.  The defense of meeting competition failed on these 
grounds.  The district court did not rule on whether a supplier was meeting his competition in giving an allowance to a dealer 
who also had competition to meet.  That was not the case before it. On appeal the Second Circuit did not reach the substantive issue, dismissing the case on the ground that the plaintiff had failed 
to prove the amount of its injuries.  Nevertheless, Judge Hand, organ of the Court, seemed to take it for granted that the 
supplier's action was the natural and lawful response to a price raid from a competitor. He said: 'It is not uncommon in the industry for a filling station to start what has come to be known as a 'gas war'; that is, to cut the 
prevailing price of gasoline, which other competing stations must meet by a corresponding cut in order to keep up their sales; 
and that makes it important * * * for the producing companies to reduce their prices to their own competing stations.' 240 F.2d

1007,19," .  W. W. Wright, 35 years with Sun, Sales Manager and Vice-President of Sun, testified: 'I would say all gasoline is sold to the 
public through stations operating or handling one brand of gasoline.' 'Although the Standard Stations and Richfield cases dealt primarily with exclusive dealing in gasoline, there is in fact little future 
in the attempt to have stations handle more than one brand. 'Split pump stations,' as they were called, were formerly quite 
common, but defects of the system caused most of them to disappear.  As early as 1931 two surveys showed 85 and 95 per 
cent of motorists expressing themselves as opposed to it, primarily out of fear that the dealer would substitute the second brand 
for the desired one.  Not only did dealers find that handling one brand required less investment and less bookkeeping, but six out 
of seven felt that it actually increased sales.  As to suppliers, they naturally dislike operating through dealers whose lack of

1009,26," .  Balian was a treble damage action under the Robinson-Patman Act in which the plaintiff ice cream manufacturers in Los 
Angeles Contended that they were injured when the defendant Arden Farms, a manufacturer and distributor, lowered its prices 
on ice cream products in the Los Angeles area only.  The Court upheld the defense of meeting competition.  A number of the ice 
cream manufacturing plants were 'captive creameries' in that they were owned by large chains and manufactured ice cream only 
for their owners.  Customers supplied by Arden were in competition with retail outlets supplied by the captive creameries.  Arden 
lowered its prices to its customers, retail dealers, to enable them to meet competition at the consumer level.  It is clear that the 
captive creameries did not offer to sell at lower prices to Arden's dealers. Arden, therefore, is in the same position as Sun in the 
instant case.  The district court (104 F.Supp. 796, 802), as well as the Court of Appeals, did not restrict the defense of meeting 
competition to the single situation where a supplier's retail dealer is offered lower prices by another supplier. The Court said: 
'The customers of Arden in the respective areas are not in competition with each other, and the products sold in each area are 
sold in competition with like products manufactured by others.' (350 U.S. 991, 231 F.2d 367.)"

1010,31," .  Most of the evidence seems clearly to demonstrate that a company offers discounts because its dealers are losing business 
to price-cutting competitors; since the major suppliers compete among themselves and with independents primarily through their 
dealers, the concessions are made in a very real sense in good faith to meet competition.  Furthermore, there is little evidence --
  and certainly none so far in these cases (Enterprise and the instant case, then before the Commission) --  that the 
discriminations complained of put a halt to price competition, or even threatened to do so.  On the contrary, dual distribution and 
discriminatory price concessions seem to have contributed on balance to the intensity of price competition, where their effects 
have been visible.' Integration and Competition in the Petroleum Industry, DeChazeau and Kahn, 480, (1959). "

1011,34," .  'The legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act discloses that one of the major dissatisfactions with original Section 2 of 
the Clayton Act was the belief that it was confined to cases where the effect of a price discrimination was on competition among 
sellers. The Robinson-Patman Act modified a number of provisions of old Section 2, including both the competitive effect and 
meeting competition clauses.  The modified provisions are distributed between the newly created subsections (a) and (b). 'There is no reason to suppose that when the prohibition was amended to include discriminations having adverse effects upon 
buyers, the failure to express a corresponding change in the meeting competition defense was anything more than the type of 
inadvertence which is the hallmark of the statute.  For it is clear that the defense was intended to be correlative with the offense.  
Nor has any reason of policy been suggested for creating an imbalance between the prohibition and the justification.  If the 
occasion for meeting competition exists, the validity of the defense should not depend on the hierarchy in the scheme of 
distribution at which competition is met.  A multi-tiered condemnation requires a multi-tiered defense.' Steed, Antitrust Problems 
Under Price War Conditions, Southwestern Institute on Antitrust Laws, 77, 99 (1958).  Wright, Vice-President and Sales 
Manager for Sun testified: 'In this setup the dealer actually is a conduit between the supplier, enjoying the patronage of the 
motorist, and the motorist and in essence they become, the dealer and the supplier become, a team of which the supplier and 
not the dealer assumes the major responsibility for promoting and guiding competition within the area * * *.  Now, it is not the 
service station operator, due to the limited facilities available, who is able to supply the repeated demand for gasoline, but it is 
the supplier who assumes that responsibility.  Service stations are just too small to permit more than a few days' supply of 
gasoline. * * * We were competing with the station as a retailer of Super-Test gasoline for the business of the motorists residing 
or working near that location, 19th and Pearl, and who would find it convenient to stop at that station.' "
1012,35," .  The Clayton Act was primarily intended to prevent predatory practices of large sellers whose selective price-cutting, often 
below cost, enabled them to kill off smaller competitors. The Robinson-Patman Act was in good part the outgrowth of the FTC's 
investigation of chain stores.  The primary purpose of the Act was to prohibit quantity discounts by large sellers where there was 
no cost saving attributable to the quantity sales.  FTC, Final Report on the Chain Store Investigation, S.Doc. No. 4, 74th Cong.,

forced to cut their prices to maintain their volume of sales. * * * (Such a decision's) sole effect is to prohibit suppliers from 
lowering their wholesale prices to help their retailers meet a competitor's price cut.  While this may prevent retail prices from 
being driven as low as might otherwise occur, the full amount of these price cuts must now come out of the dealer's profit 
margin. And since the ability of the retail dealer to meet price cuts normally acts as a deterrent to aggressive price-cutting * * *

1013,37," .  The examiner's opinion, adopted by the Commission, states: 'It is true, of course, as respondent argues, that where one or some of its dealers are faced with ruinous price competition 
respondent must take some action or suffer the loss of such dealership and respondent's competition with its own competition, 
but of course this is not the law and cannot justify price discriminations injuring others.  Respondent could, if it chose to, meet 
such competition at the dealer level by nondiscriminatory reductions in price to all dealers, or by operating its own stations and 
thus being in direct competition with other stations which reduce prices.'"
1013,38," .  The Supreme Court has said that the Robinson-Patman Act does not require a seller to choose 'between ruinously cutting its 
prices to all customers * * * or refusing to meet the competition and then ruinously raising its prices to its remaining customers to 
cover increased unit costs.' Standard Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 1951, 340 U.S. 231, 250, 71 S.Ct. 240, 250, 95

1014,41," .  A practice of tailoring tank-wagon prices to meet individual competitive situations tends to reduce the effectiveness of the 
resale-price-maintenance characteristics, such as they are, of a major's pricing policy.  The Commission's holding has the 
opposite effect since it tends to make for uniformity and rigidity in resale prices.  Cf. Adelman's thesis: 'The Act inhibits

1014,42," .  The position taken by the Commission in this case represents a shift in its views.  Before 1956 the Commission held that 
price allowance such as Sun made to McLean enjoy the protection of the defense of meeting competition.  See testimony of

] One of the anomalies created by the Robinson-Patman Act is the doctrine that the primary test of good faith is 
whether the seller's lower price was made for the purpose of beating competition; that in competing for business a seller may "

1015,44," .  Near the end of the hearing, the examiner commented: '(The Commission said) nothing in the complaint about fixing a price 
or cutting the price to within one cent of the competition * * *.  If you had an allegation that by fixing a price, by cutting the price 
or maintaining the price within one cent of the Super-Test price in order to drive Super-Test out of business or harm competition 
or unduly suppress competition, as you have in the Pure Oil case, then it would be entirely relevant to prove that, and it would 
first be necessary as a basis for that to prove that one cent would have had the effect, as you are attempting to do in the Pure 
Oil case. * * * On the (Commission's) theory anyone who cuts a price to compete is violating the law and we would have 
uniformity of price throughout the country, which is exactly what we do not want. * * * I do not think the one-cent differential has 
anything to do with the case.'"
1015,45," .  On December 1, 1955 Super Test regular gasoline was priced at 26.9 cents a gallon. December 4 it dropped to 21.9.  
December 5 it went back to 26.9.  December 12 it was down again to 21.9.  December 13 the price started at 26.9 then dropped 
to 21.9.  December 17 it was again 26.9.  December 27 it was 24.9.  January 3, 1956, it dropped to 23.9.  February 16 it went to 
22.9 and February 28 to 19.9."
1015,46," .  The examiner stated that the argument of the Commission did not 'make sense.' He said: 'You then jump to the conclusion 
that they must have agreed to fix the price because the price was a one-cent differential, but that might just as well have been a "
1016,," unilateral decision on the part of McLean or a unilateral decision on the part of Sun, if they controlled the price, as you claim. 
That would not be any evidence of an agreement between Sun Oil and McLean.'"
1016,47," .  McLean testified: 'Q. What kind of an understanding did you have with Sun Oil Company leading up to them giving you this price adjustment?  A. 
Well, I think I had been after them to get that price adjustment and on that day --  I was closed for one or two days --  and that 
day the salesman came around, Mr. Harper, and he said --  I was talking to him about it and he said if it continued, if they 
dropped again, super Test dropped again, that they would try to do something about it. 'He stayed around, I guess, 39 minutes or an hour and then he went off and on that day they did drop their prices and they gave 
me an adjustment and I dropped mine. 'Q. Now, is that all --  what were you required to do if anything to get the adjustment?  A.  To take a cut. 'Q. I will ask you this, then: Weren't you required to do something to obtain that?  A.  To obtain that price? 'Hearing Examiner Piper: Yes.  A.  No, I dropped my gas but I wasn't required --  I didn't have no agreement with them as far as 
lowering my price or raising my price or anything.  There was no agreement made. 'Q. Was there anything said to you about reducing your margin or profit?  A.  Yes my margin of profit was reduced.' "

1086,9," .  One of the authors of the Robinson-Patman Act has suggested that the failure explicitly to include under the ban of § 2(f) 
inducement and receipt of payments violating § 2(d) and (e) was inadvertent. See Dunn, Section 2(d) and (e), New York State 
Bar Association Robinson-Patman Act Symposium 55, 61 (CCH 1946)."

1086,13," .  Indeed, § 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1528, 15 U.S.C.  § 13a, makes it a criminal offense for any person 'to be a 
party to * * * any transaction of sale * * * which discriminates to his knowledge against competitors of the purchaser, in that, any * 
* * advertising service charge is granted to the purchaser over and above any * * * advertising service charge available at the 
time * * * to said competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like grade, quality, and quantity.' This section is not frequently 
invoked, and to our knowledge has not been utilized against violators of § 2(d), although the language is sufficiently broad to 
cover either party to a transaction in violation thereof."
1086,14," .  In Curtis, the agency agreement created a set of relationships and responsibilities unlike that which would have resulted from 
contracts of sale.  Under the antitrust laws the difference between a 'sale' and an agency relationship is not simply one for form, 
but may be 'outcome-determinative.' United States v. General Elec. Co., 272 U.S. 476, 47 S.Ct. 192, 71 L.Ed. 362. And in 
Sinclair, the very heart of a § 3 violation --  sale conditioned on buyer's refusal to purchase the goods of seller's competitor --  
was lacking.  Moreover, in neither case was there proof of injury to competition, which would have been necessary under the 
Clayton Act. See Howrey, supra note 5, at 166. "

1088,18," .  The Senate Report on § 2(d) stated: 'Such an allowance becomes unjust when the service is not rendered as agreed and 
paid for, or when, if rendered, the payment is grossly in excess of its value, or when, in any case the customer is deriving from it 
equal benefit to his own business and is thus enabled to shift to his vendor substantial portions of his own advertising cost, while 
his smaller competitor, unable to command such allowances, cannot do so.' Sen.Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1936)."
1088,19," .  Sellers are not limited to allowances for a single type of promotional program.  They may offer allowances to customers for a 
variety of programs tailored to the customer's needs, and still meet the requirement of 'proportional equality.' But the supplier 
must provide bona fide reasonable alternatives; he cannot offer a customer a service if 'the economic status of (his) business 
renders him unable to accept the offer,' for that is 'tantamount to no offer to him.' State Wholesale Grocers v. Great Atlantic & "

inconsistent with our finding that the Commission's orders are too broad.  As that case suggests, in situations where agency 
orders are subject to automatic enforcement in civil suits brought by the Attorney General, these orders must be clear and 
specific. "

nationwide and 'there is no effective nationwide area of competition', and (2) the choice of the year 1950 as the starting point of 
the survey and its failure to include data as to the years 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954. "

or undertake the construction or extension of any facilities therefor, or acquire or operate any such facilities or extensions 
thereof, unless there is in force with respect to such natural-gas company a certificate of public convenience and necessity

1114,2," Because of the posture of this case, I would not reach the question as to what weight should be given to the pendency of 
administrative merger proceedings by an antitrust court which is asked to grant interlocutory relief.  However, I think more can be 
said than the Court does in favor of staying the hand of an antitrust court pending consideration by the appropriate agency of 
matters touching on ""those areas . . . in which active regulation has been found necessary to compensate for the inability of 
competition to provide adequate regulation.""  Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 92. "
1115,3," Whatever may be the impact on a § 7 action of the Commission's approval of this merger, it can be felt only in the antitrust suit. 
Consequently, I would, as the Solicitor General has suggested, leave this issue open for consideration in the District Court 
should the agency's order be asserted as a defense in that action. "
1146,1," It should be noted that it was of no practical significance with respect to Vigorelli since Singer by the cross-license agreement 
of November 17, 1955 had already licensed Vigorelli to sell its multicam machine in the United States and, therefore, could not 
bring any infringement action against Vigorelli in any event. Thus, properly interpreted, this provision restricted Singer's freedom 
to enforce the Gegauf patents only with respect to Pfaff. "
