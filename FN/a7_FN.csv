unlawful."" Federal Trade Commission Act, ยง 5(a)(1), 66 Stat. 632; 15 USC ยง 45(a)(1)."
22,2," Since World War II, service stations have become increasingly important as TBA outlets. Their large number, the convenient 
location of the usual station, the availability of TBA for immediate installation at a station, and the possibility of the ""single stop"" 
at one station for all automotive needs contribute to the still rising importance of gasoline service stations as market outlets for 
TBA.  Shell's evidence indicates that in 1958 about 45 per cent of all TBA was sold through service stations, a figure 
representing an estimated increase of 14 per cent in ten years.  Shell estimates that in 1955 about 50 per cent of the sales of 
replacement tires was made through service stations. "
23,3," Shell receives 10 per cent of the gross sales made by Firestone to Shell dealers and 7 1/2 per cent of the gross sales to Shell 
jobbers. To simplify bookkeeping, each Shell dealer is assigned to a specific Firestone wholesale ""supply point "".  Since Shell 
sells no TBA itself, the Commission accurately, if pejoratively, terms these payments an ""override "". There is a spirited difference between the parties as to whether the commission represents compensatory payments or a 
windfall.  One ancient intra-company letter dating from 1947 suggests that the payments were ""almost all net profit "".  In 1956 
Shell received about $3.6 million in commissions from Firestone and Goodyear.  If indeed this sum represented ""almost all net 
profit"" it was a healthy profit for a company that allegedly entered the TBA jungle only to insure its market position in the sale of 
gasoline and other petroleum products.  However, uncontradicted evidence of Shell's promotional costs in 1956 demonstrates 
that the commission payments were no windfall.  Shell's promotional activities in 1956 cost $3.2 million, leaving it with a mere 
$400,000 profit from TBA, a negligible sum considering the magnitude of its petroleum enterprises.  Shell estimated the costs as 
follows: Credit costs from the use of credit cards and deferred payment plan $ 500,000 Maintenance, repairs, and depreciation on displays and promotional equipment"
23,600," ,000 Promotion and advertising"
23,2," ,225,000 Total $ 3,325,000 Strangely, this accounting does not even include the cost of personnel involved in TBA promotion. This cost was estimated at 
$1,875,000 for 1956 and would have raised Shell's TBA costs to $5,260,000, or $1,600,000 in excess of its commission 
revenue.  There is of course no way of knowing in dollar and cents the extent to which Shell's TBA program promoted its sales of 
gasoline. Shell was satisfied with its program; at any rate, it preferred that program to any other."
23,4," In order to offer a sales commission plan, a tire manufacturer must be able to offer a complete line of TBA to its service station 
customers; those items which it does not manufacture must be purchased and stocked (usually under its own private brand 
name).  Furthermore, the company must have distributive facilities at least as widespread as are the dealers of its customers. "
24,," This means a national distribution system.  Only four, possibly three, tire manufacturers (Goodyear, Firestone, Goodrich, and, 
possibly, U.S. Rubber) satisfy these requisites.  They are dominant in the area of sales commission plans.  But the smaller 
companies, as well as the giants, may participate in purchase-resale plans whereby the oil companies assemble their own TBA 
package.  Most of the tire manufacturers, and here Firestone is a notable exception, do in fact participate to some extent in 
purchase-resale programs. The gasoline market is a rough-tough competitive struggle pitting a few giants struggling against each other and against a large 
number of pigmy producers.  In this context the purchase-resale and the sales commission programs work in opposite 
directions.  To enter into a purchase-resale program, an oil company must have resources large enough to finance an extensive 
TBA inventory.  It must also have sales and distributive facilities for marketing these products.  And, of course, the oil company 
must have an established reputation for quality, if it seeks to market TBA under a private label.  As a result, the small companies 
prefer the less burdensome sales commission plans; the giants, notably Standard Oil, are capable of purchasing and reselling a 
complete line of TBA under their own brand names.  In Atlantic the Supreme Court expressly refrained from passing on the 
merits of the purchase-resale plan. The amicus curiae brief of Champlin Oil & Refining Co. (concurred in by Ashland Oil & Refining Company, Continental Oil 
Company, Jenney Manufacturing Company, Inc., Leonard Refineries, Inc., Shell Oil Company, South Penn Oil Company, and 
Sunray D-X Oil Company) makes the point that ""virtually every marketing oil company in the United States provides a TBA 
program for the benefit of its marketing outlets "".  Champlin and other small or relatively small companies use the sales 
commission plan because it enables them to provide the necessary TBA program without having to invest in a large TBA 
inventory.  Champlin avows that a per se approach to the problem will force it to use the purchase-resale system, make 
unnecessary demands on its capital, and place it at a disadvantage in competing with large oil companies having a nationwide 
system of distribution."
24,5," The examiner found as to Shell: ""No inference or implication can be drawn simply from the contractual relationship between 
Shell and its dealers that the degree of control by Shell over its dealers is sufficient to force dealers to purchase only sponsored 
TBA."""
24,6," The examiner found that there was ""no evidence"" that Firestone ""participated"" in any coercive practices.  But as to Shell: ""Shell 
representatives . . . did . . . force Shell dealers to purchase substantial quantities of Goodyear and Firestone TBA . . . [by] 
demands that dealers discontinue the purchase or display of non-sponsored TBA under threat of lease cancellation or other 
corrective action."""

gone further than to enjoin overt coercive acts.   Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Co., 4 Cir. 1960, 286 F.2d 832, cert. denied, 1961,

25,8," Opinion on remand in Texaco-Goodrich, FTC Docket 6485, Jan. 14, 1966."
25,9," In remanding the case to the examiner, the Commission said: ""The determination of whether Texaco's exercise of such economic power in favor of Firestone and Goodyear under the oil 
company's sales commission contracts with these rubber companies constitutes an unfair method of competition depends, 
therefore, upon the competitive effects of these sales commission contracts; not upon whether Texaco has exercised its 
power to implement such contracts through the use of overt coercive tactics, or by more subtle, but equally effective, 
means. . . .  Whether the sales commission agreements between Firestone and Texaco and Goodrich and Texaco are 
unlawful must depend, therefore, upon the characteristics and the competitive effects of these sales commission 
agreements.  For reasons set forth hereinafter, we conclude that this case must be remanded in order that market data may 
be introduced to show the competitive effects of Texaco's sales commission agreements with Goodrich and Firestone upon 
competing suppliers of tires, batteries and accessories at the manufacturing, wholesale and retail levels.""  58 F.T.C. 1176."
25,10," Texaco-Goodrich also involved the question whether the Chairman of the Commission was disqualified from participating in 
the decision because he had indicated in a speech made while the case was pending that he had prejudged it.  The Court 
dismissed the case because the Commission's orders were not supported by the record and because of the undue protraction of 
the administrative process."

27,15," The complaint did not allege, in terms, a tying arrangement or a per se violation.  Counsel for Shell asserts in his brief in this 
Court that during the trial neither theory was mentioned.  The briefs filed with the examiner and, on appeal, with the Commission, 
do not discuss tying or per se arguments. Mr. Justice Goldberg, in his dissent in Atlantic, said: ""In short, the Commission opinions in this and the related cases are bathed 
in confusion and leave unanswered a number of questions necessarily involved in the decision of these cases.  Are TBA sales-
commission plans only unfair methods of competition if the oil company has used coercive tactics on its dealers? If they are 
illegal without past or present evidence of coercion, are they illegal for oil companies which do not have the same relation with 
their dealers as Atlantic has with its dealers? Are they illegal for oil companies which do not have the same market position as 
Atlantic?  Has the Commission drawn a distinction between sales commission and purchase-resale TBA promotion plans, 
condemning the former but approving the latter? If it has, is there a rational basis, consistent with the policies of ยง 5, for such a 
distinction?  All of these questions appear to me to be inadequately answered by the Commission's opinion. . . . Moreover, if in 
these and the related cases the Commission is laying down the broad rule that all sales-commission TBA promotion 
arrangements in the oil industry are per se unfair methods of competition, such a rule has neither been clearly articulated nor 
supported with adequate economic analysis."""
27,16," One commentator has observed: ""[A distinction should be drawn between] restraints of trade, which constitute clear public 
injury, with mere restrictions on the freedom of the dealer to act as an independent businessman.  This is where the approach of 
the Seventh Circuit would seem to differ significantly from the approach of the Commission.  The Commission accepted the fact 
that the oil companies enjoyed controlling economic power over their dealers but did not condemn its use as such; it condemned 
only the abuse of this power.  Only when it resulted in anti-competitive effects did the Commission step in.  By applying the tying 
arrangement analogy, the Seventh Circuit effectuated an important shift in emphasis from preventing anti-competitive effects 
toward protecting the dealers."" Note,  63 Mich. L. Rev. 713, 719 (1965)."

TBA sold to dealers is tied to gasoline and oil or to the leasing of service stations, or to both.  Goodyear's TBA sales, therefore, 
do not result from competition in the open market, but from Goodyear's purchasing a captive market.  The lack of an express tie 
is unimportant; a tying arrangement may be found in a course of dealing between the parties.   McElhenney Co. v. Western Auto 
Supply Co., 4 Cir. 1959, 269 F.2d 332. The Court has treated tying arrangements generally as per se violations of antitrust law

that they hardly serve any purpose beyond the suppression of competition."" Van Cise, The Future of Per Se in Antitrust Law,

30,21," The statistical picture is muddy.  The Commission estimates that in 1955 about 34,795,000,000 gallons of gasoline were sold 
at retail in the United States.  This figure is based on the total sales of gasoline (46,394,000,000 gallons) published by the Ethyl 
Corporation and the assumption that 75 per cent of the gasoline sold in the United States is sold at retail. In 1954 Shell sold 
1,890,491,000 gallons of gasoline to service stations (about 5 per cent of the 1955 total) and it sold an additional 1,039,344,000 
gallons to jobbers. There is no indication of how much of the gasoline sold to jobbers ultimately is sold at retail. (The 
Commission, in its opinion, seemed to indicate that all of this gasoline would be sold at retail. It also picked up the figure as 1.4 
billion gallons instead of the proper 1.04 billion gallons. Nevertheless, the Commission finally found that Shell sold about 5 per 
cent of the national market, a figure that indicates the Commission's view that only the gasoline sold directly to retailers was 
considered relevant.) In addition to the gasoline sold to retailers and to jobbers, Shell sold 5,486,000 gallons of gasoline at 
stations Shell owned and operated.  In light of the lack of certainty behind the statistical analysis, it is improper to be more 
specific than to say that in the years of 1954 and 1955 Shell supplied in excess of 5 per cent of the gasoline sold at retail in the 
United States."
30,22," Four different types of service station operators acquire their gasoline directly from Shell.  (1) At one extreme are the 
commission stations, designated as ""C"" stations.  These stations are owned by Shell and operated by managers who sell 
gasoline and petroleum products as commission agents.  They are independent businessmen as to TBA and other products, 
except that they are restricted to selling ""such merchandise as Shell may approve"".  (2) Next, there are lessees, ""L"" dealers, who 
rent their stations, including the pumps and tanks, from Shell.  Ostensibly, ""L"" dealers are independent of their supplier-landlord.  
The leases are usually for one year and are automatically renewed; no cause is necessary for refusal to renew a lease at the 
end of its term. (3) ""DL"" stations are similar to the ""L"" stations. DL operators own their own stations, but lease them to Shell.  
Shell, in turn, leases these stations back to their owners for the same period of time and at the same rental.  This procedure is 
used for the purpose of providing collateral -- the Shell lease -- upon which the operator can borrow money to finance the 
construction or improvement of his station. In some cases Shell does this financing itself.  The leases are for varying lengths of 
time and are automatically renewed from year to year after the initial period.  (4) Finally, there are the other dealers, ""OD"" 
dealers, who either own their own stations outright or lease them from some third party.  OD dealers purchase gasoline from 
Shell through yearly contracts (dealer sales agreements) terminable by Shell.  Many OD stations are not gasoline stations as 
such, but are restaurants, garages, parking lots, or other businesses that incidentally have gasoline pumps.  The TBA sales 
potential from an ""OD"" station is usually smaller than it is from other Shell outlets. In addition to selling through service stations, 
Shell sells through jobbers. In 1955 Shell's direct outlets and their relative importance as purchasers of gasoline were as follows: ""C"" ""L"" "

31,100," .00 The picture of Shell's distributive system is completed by adding sales to 847 jobbers who supply, among others, about 13,000 
retail gasoline stations, and the sales made by Shell in its few wholly owned and operated retail outlets. In 1955 Shell's sales to 
jobbers amounted to around 1.04 billion gallons; direct retail sales amounted to around 5 million gallons. "
32,23," The relatively heavy cost of constructing a modern service station accounts in part for the dealers' (retailers) high degree of 
financial dependence on major oil companies.  In 1957 the average total cost of construction of a Shell station, including land 
costs, was $92,000.  When an untrained man is accepted by Shell as a dealer, the usual procedure is to start him off as a 
commission agent.  The C operators usually have no investment in the service station itself; they are responsible for furnishing 
any inventory of TBA.  This, together with tools and equipment, means an investment of about from $3,000 to $7,000.  C 
operators are completely dependent upon remaining in the good graces of their Shell employers; for any reason at all, Shell may 
change or remove a C dealer upon only twelve hours notice.  After a C dealer is initiated into his operation, Shell often converts 
the station into an L station, thereby giving its operator a good deal more freedom and security along with considerably more 
financial responsibility.  Personal investments in L and DL stations (exclusive of land) are usually between $5,000 and $15,000 
on which $2,000 and $4,000 represents TBA inventory."
32,24," Shell promotes Firestone and Goodyear TBA in a number of ways.  (1) Shell informs these companies when new service 
stations will be opened and new dealers initiated, enabling the nominee rubber company to start soliciting the new business far 
in advance of its other competitors.  (2) Shell operates dealer training schools and dealer clinics and holds sales meetings where 
Firestone and Goodyear TBA products are strongly recommended and are invariably used in demonstrations.  (3) Because of 
the tremendous variety of automotive replacement parts, service station dealers, particularly newcomers, need expert advice on 
inventory.  Firestone and Goodyear prepare elaborate inventory guides geared to their TBA. Shell distributes these guides to its 
dealers carrying Firestone or Goodyear TBA.  (4) Shell dealers are authorized to sell TBA to motorists on Shell credit cards on 
ordinary credit terms or on a six month deferred payment credit plan; however, the dealers may sell all TBA, whether sponsored 
or not, on such credit.  (5) Shell representatives and the rubber company representatives participate in advertising and other 
promotional activities for the sale of TBA.  Some promotions are sponsored jointly; some are paid for by Shell alone.  The 
promotion may take the form of an advertising campaign or the distribution of Goodyear or Firestone signs, racks, or window 
decals to the Shell service stations. (6) The activity considered most valuable and relied upon to bring fast results is "" double- "
33,," teaming"" by salesmen from Shell and Firestone or Goodyear.  A Shell salesman supervises 15 or 20 stations. He is Shell's link 
with its dealers, handling negotiations for lease renewal, rental changes, or other adjustments.  The salesmen assist in adjusting 
complaints of Shell dealers against Firestone and Goodyear and gives merchandising advice to dealers. The Commission's brief 
characterizes the Shell salesman as the ""big brother"" of the dealer, although this characterization was used by only one witness 
and then, perhaps, not with an Orwellian connotation.  In any event, when a TBA representative finds difficulty in moving his line 
to a nominated dealer, he calls upon the Shell salesman to accompany him on his sales rounds.  Their joint solicitation makes 
clear to a dealer Shell's interest in TBA and, to no one's surprise, the team produces excellent results.  The Commission 
contends that the salesmen go beyond the proper limits of salesmanship and promotion by threatening that Shell will not renew 
leases or will increase the rents or turn down equipment loans or in other ways injure a balky dealer, if dealers do not carry and 
sell a sufficient quantity of Firestone (and Goodyear) TBA.  Shell and Firestone vigorously deny any coercion through threats or 
otherwise. "
34,25," Shell dealers understand they are required to purchase sponsored TBA; they believe failure to cooperate may result in 
franchise termination; Shell dealers generally purchase substantial quantities of sponsored TBA and correspondingly refuse to 
purchase TBA from nonsupported sources; the purchase of nonsponsored TBA is something ""tolerated"" by Shell in 
emergencies; Shell stations generally are identified ""Firestone"" or ""Goodyear""; Shell, Firestone and Goodyear understand that, 
under the system, Shell is the ""customer"" or ""account"" and that its stations will automatically follow; Firestone understands that 
its only competitor with Shell is Goodyear; Firestone and Goodyear do not compete for the TBA business of a Shell station once 
it is assigned to the other; Firestone signs contracts with virtually all of the Shell stations assigned to it which have TBA potential; 
and Goodyear has sold more TBA to Shell stations than has Firestone; intrabrand competitive injury results from the system's 
requirement that each Shell station may purchase only from its designated supply point."
34,26," Shell maintains that many stations are ""nominated"" to serve as supply points of both Goodyear and Firestone.  The 
Commission, however, found that less than ten per cent of the Shell stations with any TBA potential were nominated by both 
manufacturers. The Commission found also that usually stations are nominated before they are opened, and once one 
manufacturer secures the nomination the other company will not solicit the dealer's business.  Although Goodyear and Firestone 
are far and away the largest competitors in the replacement tire market, a market known for its keen competition, the record 
shows that any competitive activity between them is aimed only at influencing Shell to change a nomination."
34,27," In 1954 Shell sold 2,824,407,000 gallons of gasoline to its service stations and jobbers. During that same year, these outlets 
purchased $33,798,000 in sponsored TBA from Firestone and Goodyear.  By dividing the latter figure into the former, Shell 
derives $11.97 as a dollars per 1,000 gallons of gasoline figure for sponsored TBA in 1954. "
35,," Total sales of tires and tubes from service stations in 1954 were $290,620,000.  This volume was sold by 124,548 service 
stations. In that the Census Bureau listed some 182,000 service stations in 1954, it is indicated that about 57,500 service 
stations sold no tires and tubes in 1954.  Of those that did sell them, the average sales per station was $2,333 in 1954. In this same year service stations sold $355,202,000 in batteries and accessories. In this case 135,791 stations handled these 
items indicating that more than 46,000 did not.  For the stations which handled batteries and accessories, the average sales per 
station was $2,616. Shell adds the figure of $2,333 to $2,616, the sum of which is $4,949.  This is purported to be total TBA sales per station. That 
is, of course, a bastard figure in that its components come from arithmetic divisions which were made with different divisors.  
Even if it were possible to assume that all stations handling tires and tubes also handled batteries and accessories, this figure 
would still be a false one.  Nevertheless, Shell braves along and divides this figure into the figure representing the average 
gasoline gallonage per service station in 1954 (137,972 gallons).  This division brings it a purported national TBA sales per 
1,000 gallons of gasoline of $35.87.  By comparing $35.87 with $11.97, Shell is happily able to assert that Firestone and 
Goodyear supplied 1/3 of the Shell service station market. Two errors cast doubt on the Shell statistical analysis.  Even if we were to close our eyes to the manner in which the average 
total TBA sales were compiled, the fact remains that the national figures involved only service stations which carried TBA. There 
is no telling from the statistics offered how many of the stations carried tires alone, how many carried only batteries and 
accessories, and how many carried a full line of TBA.  The figure of $35.87 serves no useful purpose. If total sales of tires and tubes were added to total sales of batteries and accessories, the total for 1954 would be $645,822,000.  
Using Shell's figures for the total amount of gasoline sold by service stations in 1954 (25,176,029,000 gallons), we could divide 
the gallonage total into the TBA volume amount in order to get a nationwide dollar per 1,000 gallon figure, not taking into 
account the fact that some stations sold no TBA (irrelevant for this analysis unless it can be shown that Shell stations are more 
likely to handle TBA than non-Shell stations -- a fact which is certainly likely but never shown).  The resulting figure is $25.65. The figure would possibly be comparable to the $11.97 figure for sponsored TBA were it not for Shell's second basic error.  In 
establishing the sponsored figure, Shell used its total sales to service stations and jobbers. There is no question that much of the 
gasoline sold to jobbers is not ultimately sold at service stations but is sold to motor fleet owners, airlines, and other direct 
purchasers.  The $11.97 figure is therefore, too low for service stations, but there is no evidence in the massive record to 
indicate just how low it is. In summary, we can gain very little positive knowledge from Shell's laborious statistical analyses."
35,28," The Commission's method of computation involves the comparison of Shell's percentage share in the national gasoline market 
(sold through service stations) with the share of its sponsored TBA in the national TBA market (sold through service stations).  
The underlying assumption is that a service station will have TBA potential in relation to its gasoline sales and this assumption is 
accepted by all parties. The Commission offers 5 per cent as Shell's share in the national service station gasoline market.  See 
Footnote 12.  The major error is that it takes into account only the sales to direct dealers and ignores sales through jobbers. This 
glaring omission indicates that Shell's share in the market is in excess of 5 per cent although it is impossible to estimate to what 
extent. At the same time, the Commission offers 3.4 per cent as Shell's sponsored TBA share in the national service station TBA 
market.  Although there is some indication that some sponsored TBA is sold to non-service station outlets, the division of Shell's 
sponsored sales volume into the national service station TBA volume would appear to be a warranted statistical method were it 
not for the fact that the Commission chose to use figures from the year 1947. It thus attempts to compare a percentage from 
1947 with one from 1954; the TBA market saw such revolutionary changes during this period that it is impossible to determine 
the distortion which results from this comparison. "

Southern California area, and others to the plaintiff unknown . . . ."""
44,3," Since the evidence does not consistently distinguish between ""discount houses"" and ""referral services,"" based either on the 
variety of goods offered to the public or on the nature of the arrangement between the establishment and the franchised dealer 
which supplied it with cars, we shall hereinafter use the term ""discounter"" to embrace all such establishments. "
45,4," One dealer, for example, paid its referral service one-third of the gross profit on each sale, up to $ 75, there being no fixed price 
at which the sale was to take place.  The same dealer earlier had paid a flat fee of $ 17.50 for every referral, whether or not the 
sale was consummated."
45,5," At least one discount house actually purchased its cars from cooperative dealers, then resold them to its customers. In this 
situation, which in the trade is referred to as ""bootlegging,"" the customer does not receive a new-car warranty. General Motors, 
while disapproving of the practice, does not assert that it violates the ""location clause."" In those arrangements against which 
General Motors and the associations did direct their efforts, title to the new car passed directly from dealer to retail customer, 
who thus obtained a new-car warranty and service agreement. There must also be distinguished the ubiquitous practice of using ""bird dogs"" -- informal sources who steer occasional 
customers toward a particular dealer, in return for relatively small fees -- often a bottle of liquor.  This practice is not only deemed 
by General Motors not to violate the ""location clause,"" but has the corporation's endorsement as a desirable sales device."
45,6," As the District Court found, 70% of the local Chevrolet dealers were located within five miles of one or more of the 23 discount 
house or referral outlets."
45,7," There is evidence in the record that discount sales undercut the prices at which franchised dealers were able to, or chose to, 
compete.  Two purchasers of Chevrolets, one on referral and the other in a discount house ""sale,"" testified that they had 
""shopped"" other dealers but found the discount and referral prices lower.  Dealers and their salesmen complained to General 
Motors about sales lost through inability to meet the discounters' price.  Moreover, the discounters advertised and actually 
provided auto loans at interest rates substantially lower than those offered by G. M. A. C., General Motors' financing subsidiary. There is also evidence that it was not just price itself which induced customers to purchase Chevrolets through the discounters. 
One customer testified that he preferred the discount house because he thereby avoided the haggling over price which seems 
an inevitable facet of purchasing a car in the orthodox way.  Others apparently assumed, without bothering to confirm by 
comparison shopping, that ""discount"" stores would offer lower prices.  This assumption was fed by discount house advertising 
which promised ""the lowest price anywhere"" and ""savings of hundreds of dollars."" "
46,8," Dealer Biggs put the same sentiments into a letter to both Keown and Chevrolet's zone manager O'Connor, written on 
November 5, 1960.  The day before, in O'Connor's presence, Keown had challenged Biggs to justify his dealings with the 
discounters. Biggs wrote: ""We would be most reluctant to discard an account as good as this one without rather concrete 
assurance that it would not immediately be picked up by another Chevrolet dealer."" Two weeks later, O'Connor forwarded Biggs' 
letter to General Motors officials in Detroit."
46,9," In Keown's words, ""We were seeking the assistance of the higher echelon officials of Chevrolet and General Motors in bringing 
about an end to the discount house sale of Chevrolets."""
46,10," O'Connor's report, dated November 22, recounted that ""zone management"" had talked with the offending dealers ""in an 
attempt to have them desist,"" and that ""our Dealer Associations have formed a committee to call on the supplying dealers and 
have asked them and have attempted to persuade them to discontinue this practice."" Supported by a copy of dealer Biggs' letter, 
see n. 8, supra, O'Connor predicted that ""many dealers will cease this type of business if they had any assurance that the 
account would not be picked up by some other dealer, immediately upon relinquishment."""
46,11," Roche wrote to those dealers who had complained directly to John Gordon, then president of General Motors.  On December 
29, 1960, a virtually identical letter went out to all General Motors dealers throughout the Nation, under the signature of the 
general sales managers for the respective divisions."
46,12," One dealer testified that he abruptly terminated arrangements long maintained with two discount houses, despite the fact that 
one of these connections owed him $ 20,000 and the other $ 28,000.  In the preceding four weeks the latter had reduced its 
indebtedness by $ 52,000 and could reasonably have been expected to erase it completely within a few weeks.  The dealer 
anticipated that upon cancellation of the accounts these debts would become uncollectible.  His fears were justified.  The 
accounts were terminated.  The debts remained unpaid. "
47,13," According to Francis Bruder, a dealer who had been doing business with the discounters since 1957, ""Cash told me that he 
felt certain that the other dealers would discontinue dealing with discount houses and referral services as well.  I left this meeting 
with the impression that every dealer who had been doing business with a discount house or referral service would soon quit."" This was precisely the impression General Motors had intended to implant.  As was explained in an inter-office memorandum to 
the general sales manager of General Motors' Chevrolet Division, ""[All dealers were talked to] in order that every dealer with 
whom the subject was discussed would know that a similar discussion was being held with all other dealers so that, if certain 
dealers should elect to discontinue their cooperation with a discount house, we might be able to discourage some other dealer 
who might be solicited from starting the practice."""
47,14," The District Court characterized this December 15 meeting as the first between representatives of the three associations, 
pertaining to the problem of discount house and referral sales.  However, as we have previously noted, n. 10, supra, O'Connor 
reported to General Motors three weeks earlier, on November 22, that the three associations had formed a committee which 
already had called upon nonconforming dealers. The record does not enable us to resolve this factual conflict, nor is its 
resolution important.  On either version, the appellee associations entered into an explicit agreement to act together to eliminate 
the new mode of intrabrand competition. "
48,15," The Government's complaint contains no reference to the ""location clause,"" and the Government concedes that its case was 
tried on a conspiracy theory, the defendants injecting the contractual issue by way of defense.  Trial counsel for the Government 
did advert to the clause in the District Court, but it does not appear that he challenged its validity, as construed, in the same 
sense that the Government does here.  See Trial Transcript, pp. 9, 17-18.  In light of our disposition of the case, we have no 
occasion to consider whether the Government's argument directed to the clause, as construed, is properly before us. "
49,16," We note that, as in  United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44-45, the ultimate conclusion by the trial judge, that the 
defendants' conduct did not constitute a combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act, is not to be shielded by the 
""clearly erroneous"" test embodied in Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That Rule in part provides: ""Findings of 
fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of 
the credibility of the witnesses."" As in  Parke Davis, supra, the question here is not one of ""fact,"" but consists rather of the legal 
standard required to be applied to the undisputed facts of the case.  See  United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 194, n. 
9;  United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., 364 U.S. 520, 526, and cases there cited. Moreover, the trial court's customary opportunity to evaluate the demeanor and thus the credibility of the witnesses, which is the 
rationale behind Rule 52 (a) (see  United States v. Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326, 331-332), plays only a restricted role 
here.  This was essentially a ""paper case."" It did not unfold by the testimony of ""live"" witnesses.  Of the 38 witnesses who gave 
testimony, only three appeared in person.  The testimony of the other 35 witnesses was submitted either by affidavit, by 
deposition, or in the form of an agreed-upon narrative of testimony given in the earlier criminal proceeding before another judge.  
A vast number of documents were also introduced, and bear on the question for decision. In any event, we resort to the record not to contradict the trial court's findings of fact, as distinguished from its conclusory 
""findings,"" but to supplement the court's factual findings and to assist us in determining whether they support the court's ultimate 
legal conclusion that there was no conspiracy. "
50,17," The December letters to all dealers said only that ""in effect, in some instances"" the arrangements in question might violate the 
unauthorized location clause of the Dealer Selling Agreement.  No dealer was told, either by letter or in person, that its conduct 
violated the franchise agreement, and no dealer was warned that continuance of discount house or referral sales would result in 
termination of its franchise. Zone manager O'Connor did not regard his instructions from Detroit as authorizing him to go that far, 
and he was of the view that ""the general letter [to all dealers] didn't suggest any such thing."""
50,18, We refer to this without considering whether General Motors could lawfully have taken such action.
50,19," James Roche testified, ""It is not [General Motors'] practice to threaten dealers with termination of their franchise."" Good 
dealers and dealer locations, he said, are hard to come by.  In many dealerships, General Motors itself has invested substantial 
funds.  Therefore, said Roche, ""we would not want our people to go in and wave the franchise agreement, selling agreement, 
and threaten the dealer with termination in the event he didn't agree, after following -- after reading a letter he was violating our 
agreement and should change his practice.  Instead we expected that this would be handled on a sound, calm, sensible 
business-like approach."" HN3[

51,22," Evidence on this subject was admitted solely for the purpose of showing the dealers' state of mind, rather than to prove the 
existence of actual price-cutting by the discounters. But the collaborators' state of mind is of significance here. "
52,23," In an inter-office memorandum, circulated among General Motors officials immediately prior to formulation of corporate policy 
vis-a-vis the discounters, it was stated that ""It would appear that one of the real hazards of condoning this type of operation is 
that discounted prices are freely quoted to a large portion of the public."" Moreover, we note that some discounters advertised 
that they would finance new-car purchases at an interest rate of 5 1/2%, a rate substantially lower than that available at 
franchised Chevrolet dealers through G. M. A. C., a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation.  See n. 7, supra.  Finally, it is 
conceded that General Motors is intensely concerned that each of its dealers has an adequate ""profit opportunity"" (see Finding 
17), a concern which necessarily involves consideration of the price realized by dealers. "

concentration. Shall we permit the economy of the country to gravitate into the hands of a few corporations . . . ?  Or on the other 
hand are we going to preserve small business, local operations, and free enterprise?"" 96 Cong. Rec. 16450. References to a number of other similar remarks by other Congressmen are collected in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370

percent of the total number of firms acquired during 1940-47 have been absorbed by larger corporations with assets of over $ 
5,000,000.  In contrast, fully 93 percent of all the firms bought out held assets of less than $ 1,000,000.  Some 33 of the Nation's

85,3," This is the first case to reach the Court under the 1950 amendment to ยง 7 that involves a merger between firms engaged solely 
in retail food distribution.  Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 40 (1959), have discussed this industry in the following terms: ""As a guess, we can say that the most important distributive trades, especially the food trades, are structurally unconcentrated in 
the metropolitan areas . . . .  The significance of structural oligopoly in terms of policy is far different in [these trades] than in 
manufacturing and mining. . . .  The traditional view that the local market industries are essentially competitive in character is

food industry is notably absent in the legislative history. Although it is clear that, in addition to the already highly oligopolized 
industries, Congress was also concerned with trends toward concentration in industries that were still highly fragmented, this 
case involves not even a remote approach to the ""monster concentration"" of which Representative Celler spoke in introducing 
the 1950 amendment in the House of Representatives.  95 Cong. Rec. 11486."

86,6," Much of the fuel for the congressional debates on concentration in the American economy was derived from a contemporary 
study by the Federal Trade Commission on corporate acquisitions between 1940 and 1947.  See Report of the Federal Trade 
Commission on the Merger Movement: A Summary Report (1948).  A critical study of the FTC report, published while the 1950 
amendment was pending in Congress, concluded that the effect of the recent merger movement on concentration had been 
slight.  Lintner & Butters, Effect of Mergers on Industrial Concentration, 1940-1947, 32 Rev. of Econ. & Statistics 30 (1950).  Two 
economists for the Federal Trade Commission later acquiesced in that conclusion.  Blair & Houghton, The Lintner-Butters 
Analysis of the Effect of Mergers on Industrial Concentration, 1940-1947, 33 Rev. of Econ. & Statistics 63, 67, n. 12 (1951)."
86,7," See S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1: ""Broadly stated, the bill, in its treatment of unlawful restraints and monopolies, seeks to prohibit and make unlawful certain trade 
practices which, as a rule, singly and in themselves, are not covered by the act of July 2, 1890 [the Sherman Act], or other 
existing antitrust acts, and thus, by making these practices illegal, to arrest the creation of trusts, conspiracies, and monopolies 
in their incipiency and before consummation."" See also S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 4-5: ""The intent here, as in other parts of the Clayton Act, is to cope with 
monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act 
proceeding;"" id., p. 6: ""The concept of reasonable probability conveyed by these words ['may be'] is a necessary element in any 
statute which seeks to arrest restraints of trade in their incipiency and before they develop into full-fledged restraints violative of 
the Sherman Act."" Thus, the Senate Reports on both the original Clayton Act and the 1950 amendment carefully delineate the ""incipiency"" with 
which the provisions are concerned as that of monopolization or classical restraints of trade under the Sherman Act. The notion 
that ""incipiency"" might be expanded to refer also to a lessening of competition first appeared in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United 
States, 370 U.S. 294, 317."
86,8," [****27] The Senate Report is clear on this point: ""The use of these words ['may be substantially to lessen competition'] means that the bill, if enacted, would not apply to the mere 
possibility but only to the reasonable probability of the prescribed [sic] effect . . . .  The words 'may be' have been in section 7 of 
the Clayton Act since 1914.  The concept of reasonable probability conveyed by these words is a necessary element in any "
87,," statute which seeks to arrest restraints of trade in their incipiency and before they develop into full-fledged restraints violative of 
the Sherman Act."" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6. See also 96 Cong. Rec. 16453 (remarks of Senator Kefauver).  Cf. 51 Cong. Rec. 14463-14464 (amendment of Senator Reed)."
87,9," Although Congress eschewed exclusively mathematical tests for assessing the impact of a merger, it offered several 
generalizations indicative of the sort of merger that might be proscribed, e. g.: Whether the merger eliminated an enterprise that 
had been a substantial factor in competition; whether the increased size of the acquiring corporation threatened to give it a 
decisive advantage over competitors; whether an undue number of competing enterprises had been eliminated.  H. R. Rep. No. 
1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8.  See Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294, 321, n. 36. Only the first of these 
generalizations is arguably applicable to the present merger; the market-extension aspects of the merger, as well as the 
evidence of Shopping Bag's declining profit margin and weak price competition, suggest that any conclusion under this test 
would be equivocal.  See infra, pp. 295-296; 298, n. 30.  Senator Kefauver stated explicitly on the Senate floor that the mere 
elimination of competition between the merged firms would not make the acquisition illegal; rather, ""the merger would have to 
have the effect of lessening competition generally."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16456."
87,10," [****28] Eighteen years ago, a dictum in  Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 46, adverted to a 
""reasonable possibility"" as the appropriate standard for the corresponding language (""may be to substantially lessen 
competition"") under ยง 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 14. The dictum provoked a sharp dissent in that case,  id., at 55, 57-58, 
and the Court subsequently withdrew it, Standard Oil Co. v.  United States, 337 U.S. 293, only to reinstate it again today.  This 
issue, which appeared settled at the time of the 1950 amendment, provoked an acrimonious exchange during the Senate 
hearings.  Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st & 2d

87,11," The decline continued at approximately the same rate to 1963, the last year for which data are available, when there were 
3,590 single-store grocery firms in the area.  The record contains no breakdown of the figures on single-store concerns.  In an 
extensive study of the retail grocery industry on a national scale, the Federal Trade Commission found that between 1939 and 
1954 the total number of grocery stores in the United States declined by 109,000, or 28%.  The entire decrease was suffered by 
stores with annual gross sales of less than $ 50,000.  During the same period, the number of stores in all higher sales brackets 
increased.  The Commission noted that the census figures, from which its data were taken, included an undetermined number of 
grocery firms liquidating after 1948 that merely closed their grocery operations and continued their remaining lines of business, 
such as nongrocery retailing, food wholesaling, food manufacturing, etc.  Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission,

87,12," The generalized case against the Court's numerical approach is stated in Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of 
Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 312, n. 261: ""There are serious problems connected with the use of this yardstick.  First, not every firm contributes equally to competition.  In 
particular, there may be a fringe of firms too small to be able to affect price and production policies in the market as a whole.  
Alternatively, certain firms may be marginal in the sense that their costs and financial situations preclude them from having 
much, if any, impact on market conditions; indeed they may be able to remain in operation only because excessive profits are "
88,," being earned by the stronger firms.  An [exit] of companies of this sort would have much less significance than a counting of 
corporate heads would imply."""
88,13," [****31] Between 1953 and 1961, the population of the Los Angeles metropolitan area increased from 4,300,000 to 6,800,000 
and the average population per grocery store increased from 695 to 1,439.  Additional opportunity for new stores in the area 
results from the geographical division of the city into numerous suburbs, as well as from the lack of specific store loyalty among 
new residents."
88,14," Cf.   Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726. In criticizing a recent decision of the Federal Trade Commission, one commentator 
has stated, in terms applicable mutatis mutandis to the Court's decision in the present case: "". . . Any child alive in the 1950's could see that a restructuring of food retailing was then going on.  The business was adjusting 
itself, through market mechanisms that included merger, to vast and profound changes in the American way of life.  There is not 
a word in the FTC majority opinion that relates changes in the number of stores and chains to the proliferation of suburbs, the 
construction of shopping centers, and the final triumph of the supermarket -- an innovation in retailing that has since spread 
across the Western world.  The most important single cause of these changes was the automobile revolution . . . which not even 
the FTC can stop. . . . "". . . Plenty of living American men and women remember an era when virtually all groceries were sold through very small stores 
none of which had 'any significant market share.' Was this era the high point of competition in food retailing? Many little towns 
had, in fact, only one place where a given kind of food could be bought.  In a typical city neighborhood, defined by the range of a 
housewife's willingness to lug groceries home on foot, there might be three or four relaxed 'competitors.' If she did not like the 
price or quality offered by them, she could take her black-string market bag, board a trolley car, and try her luck among the 
relaxed 'competitors' of some other neighborhood."" Ways, A New ""Worst"" in Antitrust, Fortune, April 1966, pp. 111-112. In the present case, the District Court found that in the era preceding the rise of the supermarkets, ""the area from which the 
typical store drew most of its customers was limited to a block or two in any direction and if a particular grocery store happened 
to be the only one in its immediate neighborhood, it had a virtual monopoly of local trade."" Thus, the Court's aphorism in U.S. v.  
Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 363 -- that ""competition is likely to be greatest when there are many sellers, none of which 
has any significant market share"" -- is peculiarly maladroit in the historic context of the retail food industry. See also Hampe & 
Wittenberg, The Lifeline of America: Development of the Food Industry 313-372 (1964); Lebhar, Chain Stores in America 1859-
1962, pp. 348-390 (1963). "
89,15," See Joskow, Structural Indicia: Rank-Shift Analysis as a Supplement to Concentration Ratios, VI Antitrust Bulletin 9 (1961).  In 
addition, the overall market share of the top 20 firms in fact showed a slight decline between 1958 and 1960.  The statement in 
the concurring opinion in the present case, that ""All but two of the top 10 firms in 1958 were very probably also among the top 10 
in 1948 or had acquired a firm that was among the top 10,"" is based on conjecture.  The record demonstrates only that the top 
four firms in 1948 were among the top 10 firms in 1958; the record neither identifies the remaining six of the top 10 firms in 1948 
nor charts their subsequent history."
89,16," For a similar study of the retail food industry at the national level, see Lebhar, Small Chain Virility a Bar to Monopoly, Chain 
Store Age, Jan. 1962, p. E20.  See also Gould, The Relation of Sales Growth to the Size of Multi-Store Food Retailers 6 (1966) 
(inverse correlation found between sales growth and size of chains with four or more stores)."
89,17," Of these latter 119 chains, 66 went out of business altogether, 28 reduced their operations to a single store, and 25 were 
eliminated as separate competitors as a result of acquisitions by other chains."
89,18," [****37] On the basis of these facts, one witness concluded: ""The apparent willingness and ability of grocers to expand and create new chain entities at the staggering rate of more than 17 a 
year, and the growth potential of new chains, precludes in my opinion the possibility that the retail grocery business in Los 
Angeles will become either monopolistic or oligopolistic in the foreseeable future.  It must be remembered that in 1953, only 10 
chains with as many as 10 stores each were operating in the area.  These chains are recognized as being among the best 
managed, most successful and most aggressive supermarket operators in the country.  They themselves have engaged in 
expansion programs of significant proportions since 1953.  Yet, 10 years later, instead of having swept aside all competition and 
being left alone to compete among themselves, these same 10 chains are now faced with the necessity of competing against no 
less than 14 new chains of 10 or more stores each, a significantly greater number of smaller chains and a host of successful 
single store operators, of whom many are affiliated with powerful voluntary chains or other cooperative groups. . . .  The growth "
90,," of independents into chains and of small chains into larger ones . . . demonstrates convincingly that small concerns don't have to 
remain small in Los Angeles."""
90,19," [****38] Data for 1960, the only year for which such figures are available in the record, reveal a comparable agitation of entry 
and exit among operators of single stores.  Although there was a net loss of 132 single-outlet stores in 1960, 128 new single-
outlet stores opened during the year."
90,20," As to Table 1 in the Appendix of the Court's opinion, this fact is obvious on the face of the table.  As to Table 2 in the 
Appendix, examination of the record discloses that each of the nine acquisitions listed as involving a single store represented 
purchases of single stores from chains ranging in size from two to 49 stores."
90,21, See Table 1 in the Appendix of the Court's opinion.
90,22," Table 1 in the Appendix of the Court's opinion is somewhat misleading in that it weights the data from which it is drawn in favor 
of the acquisition by grocery chains of other chains consisting of relatively larger numbers of store units.  The complete data of 
the witness included several acquisitions of one- and two-store concerns, together with the disposition of one ten-store chain to 
various individuals."
90,23," See Table 2 in the Appendix of the Court's opinion.  This table, not a part of the record, was submitted by the Government in 
its reply brief, filed on the eve of oral argument. "

91,25," Evidence introduced by the defendants indicated that the overlap between the Von's and Shopping Bag stores was 
significantly smaller than that proposed by the government witness."
91,26," At the time of the merger in 1960, Von's operated 28 retail grocery stores in the Los Angeles area.  It commenced operation as 
a partnership of the Von der Ahe family in 1932, during the depression, with a food concession in a small grocery store. 
Shopping Bag operated 36 stores in Los Angeles at the time of the merger; it commenced operation as a partnership in a small 
grocery store in 1930.  So far as the record reveals, the competitive behavior of these firms was impeccable throughout their 
expansion, which took place solely by internal growth.  In discussing the success of comparable firms vis-a-vis the Sherman Act, 
Judge Learned Hand stated, ""The Act does not mean to condemn the resultant of those very forces which it is its prime object to 
foster: finis opus coronat.  The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.""  
United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 430."
91,27," [****47] Nor is it altogether easy to escape the feeling that it is not so much this merger, but Los Angeles itself, that is being 
invalidated here.  Cf. Adelman, Antitrust Problems: The Antimerger Act, 1950-60,  51 Am. Econ. Rev. 236, 243 (May 1961): ""In "
92,," the antitrust dictionary, 'powerful' has no necessary connection with monopoly power or market control or even market share. It 
means . . . one four-letter word: size."" Los Angeles is, to be sure, a big place.  Although Shopping Bag's share of the Los 
Angeles market was only 4.2%, its sales in 1958 totaled $ 84,000,000.  Compare the Court's statement in Tampa Electric Co. v.  
Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 333-334: ""It is urged that the present contract pre-empts competition to the extent of purchases worth perhaps $ 128,000,000, and that 
this 'is, of course, not insignificant or insubstantial.' While $ 128,000,000 is a considerable sum of money, even in these days, 
the dollar volume, by itself, is not the test . . . ."""
92,28," This is not a ""merger between two small companies to enable the combination to compete more effectively with larger 
corporations dominating the relevant market,"" Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294, 319; cf. House Hearing, supra, 
n. 5, pp. 40-41; Senate Hearings, supra, n. 10, pp. 6, 51; 95 Cong. Rec. 11486, 11488, 11506; 96 Cong. Rec. 16436; H. R. Rep. 
No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 6-8; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4.  However, the Court today in a gratuitous 
dictum, ante, p. 277, undercuts even that principle by confining it to cases in which competitors are obliged to merge to save 
themselves from destruction by a larger and more powerful competitor."
92,29," [****48] Mr. Hayden, the president and principal stockholder of Shopping Bag, was advanced in years and was concerned 
over the absence of a strong management staff that could take over his responsibilities."
92,30," Von's was a considerably more successful competitor than Shopping Bag.  Shopping Bag's net income as a percentage of 
total sales declined from 1.6% in 1957 to 0.9% in 1959, and its net profit as a percentage of total assets declined from 6.6% to 
3.2%.  During the same period, the net income of Von's increased from 2.1% to 2.3%, and its net profits declined from 12.7% to 
10.8%."
92,31," One single-store operator, located adjacent to one supermarket and within a mile of two others, testified, ""I have often been 
asked if I could compete successfully against this sort of competition.  My answer is and always has been that the question is 
not whether I can compete against them, but whether they can compete against me."" Another single-store operator testified, ""Competition in the grocery business is on a store-by-store basis and any aggressive and 
able operator like myself can out-compete the store of any of the chains because of personalized service, better labor relations, 
and being in personal charge of the store and seeing that it is run properly."" A third single-store operator testified, ""The chains in this area are good operators, but when they grow too large, they are 
actually easier to compete with from an independent's viewpoint.  If I had a choice, I would rather operate a store near a chain 
unit than near another independent."""
92,32," [****50] See generally Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission, Economic Inquiry Into Food Marketing, Part I, 
Concentration and Integration in Retailing, c. VI, ""Retailer-owned Cooperative Food Wholesalers""; c. VII, ""Wholesaler-sponsored 
Voluntary Retail Groups"" (1960).  The annual sales of Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., a retailer-owned cooperative whose 
members do business principally in the Los Angeles area, rose fourfold from $ 87,000,000 in 1948 to $ 345,000,000 in 1962, "
93,," and the volume of its purchases exceeded that of all but the largest national chains doing business in Los Angeles.  Most of the 
leading chains in the area began development in association with Certified Grocers, called the ""mother"" of the industry.  In some 
cases the cooperatives were able to offer even lower prices to their members than competing chains could obtain.  The District 
Court found that the cooperatives also provided their members with assistance in merchandising, advertising, promotions, 
inventory control, and even the financing of new entry."
93,33," See Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 302-303 (1960)."
93,34," In a footnote, the Court emphasized the corollary principle that, ""if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing 
even slight increases in concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventual deconcentration is correspondingly great."" 
U.S. v.  Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 365, n. 42. That corollary, of course, has no application here, since the Los 
Angeles retail grocery market can in no sense be characterized as one in which ""concentration is already great."" Compare  
United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 377 U.S. 271;  United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441. The importance 
of a trend toward concentration in the particular industry in question was recognized in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 "
94,," U.S. 294, 332. See also  Pillsbury Mills, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 555, 572-573;  United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F.Supp.

94,35," [****55] As a result of the merger, the market share of the two largest firms increased from 14.4% to 15.5%, and the share of 
the six largest firms increased from 32.1% to 35.4%.  The merger involved in Philadelphia Nat. Bank produced a single firm 
controlling 30% of the market, and resulted in an increase from 44% to 59% in the market share of the two largest firms in the 
market.  The Court's opinion is remarkable for its failure to support its conclusion by reference to even a single piece of 
economic theory.  I shall not dwell here on the barometers of competition that have been suggested by the commentators.  But it 
seems important to note that the present merger falls either outside, or at the very fringe, of the various mechanical tests that 
have been proposed.  See, e. g., Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 133-136 (1959) (horizontal merger with direct competitor is 
prima facie unlawful where acquiring company accounts for 20% or more of the market, or where merging companies together 
constitute 20% or more of the market; acquisitions producing less than 20% market control unlawful only where special 
circumstances are present, such as serious barriers to entry or substantial influence on prices by the acquired company); Stigler, 
Mergers and Preventive Antitrust Policy,  104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 176, 179-182 (1955) (acquisition unlawful if it produces a combined 
market share of 20% or more; acquisition permitted if the combined share is less than 5-10%); Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act 
and the Merging of Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 308-329 (1960) (no merger by the dominant firm in an industry if 
its market share is increased by more than 2-3%; no merger by other large firms in the industry where the combined market 
shares of the two-to-eight largest firms after the merger are increased by 7-8% or more over the shares that existed at any time 
during the preceding 5-10 years; no merger where acquired firm has 5% market share or more).  See also Markham, Merger 
Policy Under the New Section 7: A Six-Year Appraisal,  43 Va. L. Rev. 489, 521-522 (1957). The 40% rule promoted by the 
concurring opinion in the present case seems no more than an ad hoc endeavor to rationalize the holding of the Court. "

101,2," In its opinion the Commission found that the services provided by Brown in its franchise program were the ""prime motivation"" 
for dealers to join and remain in the program; that the program resulted in franchised stores purchasing 75% of their total shoe 
requirements from Brown -- the remainder being for the most part shoes which were not ""conflicting"" lines, as provided by the 
agreement; that the effect of the plan was to foreclose retail outlets to Brown's competitors, particularly small manufacturers; and 
that enforcement of the plan was effected by teams of field men who called upon the shoe stores, urged the elimination of other 
manufacturers' conflicting lines and reported deviations to Brown who then cancelled under a provision of the agreement.

In fashioning what the Commission called a differentially related and finely balanced rate structure for this coal, there is no 
place for dogma or rigid formulae.  The problem calls for an expert, informed judgment on a multitude of facts.  The result is 
that the administrative rate-maker is left with broad discretion as long as no statutory requirement is overlooked.  Yet that is, 
of course, precisely the nature of the administrative process in this field.  See Board of Trade v. United States, 314 U.S.

R. Co.-Merger-N.Y. Central Ry. Co., 327 I.C.C. 475 (1966), at 509.  In Great Northern Pacific & Burlington Lines, Inc.-Merger-
Great Northern Railway Co., I.C.C. (1966), (F.D. No. 21478) ms. pp. 65-66, the Commission, explained: ""Since the McLean case 
[321 U.S. 67, 64 S. Ct. 370, 88 L. Ed. 544] requires an appraisal of adverse competitive effects following the merger, Justice and 
other opponents of the merger assert that it is appropriate, if not necessary, to determine the areas of effective competition 
through an analysis of the relevant geographic and product markets, as those terms are used in antitrust cases.  Cf.  Brown 
Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294 [82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). The Supreme Court in Seaboard Air Line R. 
Co. v. United States, 382 U.S. 154, [86 S. Ct. 277, 15 L. Ed. 2d 223] in reversing Florida East Coast Ry. Co. v. United States, 
242 F. Supp. 14 (M.D.Fla.1965), clearly held that the Commission need not determine whether the proposed merger, absent 
Commission approval, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and that in appraising the competitive effects of a proposed 
rail merger the Commission need not apply yardsticks developed for the purposes of the antitrust laws. The market criteria of 
Brown Shoe can be applied here, if at all, only with great caution and substantial qualification."" Later in the report it said (ms. p. 
91): ""In making the necessary accommodation, the Commission is not required to employ market analysis techniques such as 
those described in Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294 [82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510] (1962); nor is the 
Commission required to determine whether, but for the presence of section 5(11), the proposed merger would violate the 
antitrust laws of the United States.  These questions were recently settled in Seaboard Airline R. Co. v. United States, 382 U.S. 
154 [86 S. Ct. 277, 15 L. Ed. 2d 223] (1965), affirming the McLean case and extending its rationale to mergers alleged to be 
inconsistent with the policy of section 7 of the Clayton Act."""
114,25," Compare the statement of the Commission in Penn. R. Co-Merger-N.Y. Central Ry. Co., 327 I.C.C. 475 (1966), at 505: ""The major goals of the antitrust laws are to preserve the independent competitive status of individual firms and to curb the 
undue concentration of the American economy without any special regard for the effects of this policy in a particular 
industry.  Cf.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 316-323 [82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510] (1962); United 
States v. ALCOA, 377 U.S. 271, 279-280, [84 S. Ct. 1283, 12 L. Ed. 2d 314] (1964).  By contrast, in the transportation 
industry which is subject to extensive economic regulation, the worth of competition and not merely its preservation must be 
considered within the regulatory scheme enacted by Congress.  The very fact that Congress has seen fit to enter into the 
comprehensive regulation of transportation contradicts the notion that competition is favored without qualification.  Federal 
legislation affecting railroads is one of many areas of economic activity in which serious inroads have been made on an 
original policy favoring competition.  F.C.C. v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 92-93 [73 S. Ct. 998, 97 L. Ed. 
1470] (1952).  It is only in a blunt, undiscriminating sense that we can speak of competition as an ultimate good.  Ibid, 92 
[73 S. Ct. 998]."" The history of the relationship between the Central Pacific Railway Co. (hereafter C.P.R.) and the Southern Pacific [Railroad] 
Company (hereafter S.P.) is a case in point.  In 1914 the United States instituted suit to enjoin the S.P. from controlling the 
C.P.R., because it violated the antitrust laws. In 1917 the district court dismissed the suit.  On direct appeal, the Supreme Court 
held that the combination of the two railroads ""fetters the free and normal flow of competition * * * tends to monopolization [of the "
115,," affected rail traffic]."" United States v. Southern Pacific Co., 259 U.S. 214 at 229, 42 S. Ct. 496, at 498, 66 L. Ed. 907 (1922). The 
Supreme Court went on to say (259 U.S. at 230-232, 42 S. Ct. at 499): ""We reach the conclusion that the stock ownership in the 
Central Pacific acquired by the Southern Pacific is violative of the Sherman Act within the principles settled by this court * * * 
[which] collectively, establish that one system of railroad transportation cannot acquire another, nor a substantial and vital part 
thereof, when the effect of such acquisition is to suppress, or materially reduce the free and normal flow of competition in the 
channels of interstate trade."" Following the remand of the Southern Pacific case, the C.P.R. and the S.P. applied for and 
received approval of their transaction by the ICC under section 5 of the Transportation Act of 1920.  76 I.C.C. 508 (1923). In 
United States v. Southern Pacific Co., 290 F. 443 (D.Utah 1923), the district court sustained the ICC's ruling and entered an 
order effectuating the transaction even though it found it to be in violation of the Sherman Act."

116,28," With reference to revenue from phosphate rock, the Commission said (320 I.C.C. at 153): ""The competition faced by the railroads from other modes of transport in the Tampa area is most apparent with respect to 
the movement of phosphate rock. While the tonnage of phosphate rock rail shipments increased from 9.8 million tons in 
1956 to 11 million tons in 1960, the revenue of the applicant railroads from phosphate rock was less in 1960 than in 1956 
by approximately $1.1 million, or 4.5 per cent.  This revenue decline is attributable in part to the fact that in 1960, the 
revenue per ton on phosphate rock was $2.21 as compared with $2.61 in 1956."" This, of course, may only indicate that railroads have priced themselves at a level where cross-elasticity of demand with other 
modes of carriage will take place. "
117,29," In explaining the objections to the examiner's report, the Commission observed (320 I.C.C. at 139): ""Of these exceptions, many of which obviously overlap, the most important relate to the anti-competitive consequences of 
the merger upon the shipping public, communities, and competing railroads. Justice and others contend that the examiner 
failed to make appropriate findings with respect to the anti-competitive effects and monopolistic consequences of the 
merger in Florida and in the Southeastern States generally.  Their main argument on this issue is that the merger would 
eliminate or substantially reduce competition and create a potential monopoly in the Southeastern States.  * * * Justice 
emphasizes that the merged company would operate 81 percent of all the class I railway mileage in Florida and would 
control 54.52 percent of the total southern region class I railroad mileage."" And at 163, the Commission found: ""In both the 6-and 8-State areas the merged company would have more than 54 percent of 
the total railroad mileage, while Southern, its nearest competitor, would have about 34 percent.  In Florida the merged company 
would have approximately 81 percent of the railway mileage in the State."" The Commission did go into more detail on Florida 
(320 I.C.C. at 164-66): ""The record here shows that rail competition will exist at every major city with a population in excess of 200,000 except at 
Tampa. The situation at Tampa and in the central and western portions of Florida is unique in that those areas are served 
by no other railroads except Seaboard and Coast Line.  It is to be observed that in much of Florida, Seaboard and Coast 
Line heretofore have had what might be described as an imperfect monopoly, or an oligopoly if East Coast is included.  On 
the basis of data contained in the the Official List of Open and Prepay Stations, 78 I.C.C. A-43, effective April 15, 1953, and 
considering only those points at which agents are maintained, Seaboard has been the only railroad serving approximately 
60 points in Florida, whereas Coast Line has been the only railroad serving approximately 70 Florida points.  Thus, the 
number of Florida points at which there has been no competition is about 4 times as great as the number of Florida points 
at which Seaboard and Coast Line have heretofore competed.  In our opinion, the diminution of competition within the State 
of Florida that would result from the proposed merger is largely a matter of degree.  At most, the rail monopoly that would 
result from the merger in portions of Florida would merely supplant the duopoly which has long existed there and from 
which there have been no appreciable adverse competitive effects upon communities or the shipping public. ""Although the merged company would have a preponderance of the railway mileage in Florida, its lines would connect with 
other rail carriers in that State at the following points: ""East Coast Benson Junction, West Plam Beach, Jacksonville, Lake "
118,," Harbor, Marcy Miami. ""GS&F (Southern subsidiary) Jacksonville, Crawford, Hampton, Lake City, Jasper, Lake Butler, Palatka. ""L&N Chattahoochee. ""Live Oak, Perry & Gulf (Southern subsidiary) Live Oak, Perry, Slade. ""South Georgia (Southern subsidiary) Perry, Greenville. ""Southern Railway Jacksonville. ""To illustrate further the anticipated effect of the merger upon the public in Florida, at the hearings in Tampa, the area in 
which the concern of monopoly is most prevalent, 19 shippers testified in support of the merger and 47 others would also 
have testified in support of it had the examiner not invoked the cumulative evidence rule.  By contrast, only four shippers in 
the area testified in opposition to the merger. In any event, the percentage of railway mileage which would be operated by 
the merged company in Florida or the 6-and 8-State areas involved does not, standing alone, provide a suitable criterion for 
determining the sufficiency of the rail competition that would remain after the merger."" The Commission again noted the effect in Florida (320 I.C.C. at 211): ""Except in portions of Florida, the overall reduction in rail 
competition in the Southeastern States will be relatively moderate and inconsequential when viewed in the light of the alternative 
rail service that will be provided by competitors of the merged company at most of the major industrial centers in the affected 
area."" "
119,30," As pointed out by the Southern Railway System at oral argument, nine bulk commodities handled by the merging railroads 
account for approximately 75-77% of their business.  See dissent of Commissioner Webb, 320 I.C.C. 214, 230-32. The record 
does not show what portions of the merging companies' revnues or profits are generated by the carriage of long-haul bulk 
products originating in Central and Western Florida. Nor does the record show that effective competition for this type of carriage 
presently exists in Florida. "

Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. and New York, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. - Merger, 324 I.C.C. 1 (1964). Section 5(2) of the 
Act is not limited to transactions involving a union of the weak and the weak, the strong and the weak or the large and the 
small. On the other hand, the prosperous condition of the major applicants is a highly material fact.  Where carriers are so 
impoverished that they are unable, individually, to constantly improve their transportation services and facilities, the public 
interest involved in a pooling of their resources is obviously stronger than in a case where, as here, the applicants are 
financially able to improve their plants and facilities in step with advances in rail technology."" See also the Commission's Discussion I.C.C., ms. pp. 96-97."

126,36," It is not our function to decide whether the Commission's conclusions as applied in this case were wise. It may be that more, 
not less, intramodal competition was needed in Florida.  We are not at all certain that the government, had it availed itself of the 
opportunity provided, could not have shown how ineffective intermodal competition is in Florida.  But the Commission went so far 
as to conclude that a monopoly in Florida was not too high a price to pay for increased intra and intermodal competition in the 
southeastern part of our Nation where improved transportation is needed.  This was not an unreasonable conclusion for one to

offered by the applicants nor full acquiescence in the demands of the intervening railroads, but rather are the product of our 
exhaustive study of the competitive situation in the Southeast.  We are convinced that these routing and gateway conditions will 
establish two balanced competitive systems in that area and will result in an increase rather than decrease in intramodal rail 
competition that will contribute to the present and future economic development of this important section of the Nation."""

another major competitive factor in the sale and distribution of packaged milk in the Chicago Area; ""(c) Concentration in the sale and distribution of packaged milk in the Chicago Area will be increased and deconcentration will be 
prevented; ""(d) The restraining influence on non-competitive behavior in the sale and distribution of packaged milk in the Chicago Area, 
which existed by reason of the independent operation of Bowman, will be eliminated; ""(e) The acquisition will contribute to the over-all trend toward concentration in the sale and distribution of packaged milk in the 
United States . . . thereby tending to bring about the adverse competitive effects described [elsewhere in the complaint]; ""(f) The emergence or growth of smaller packaged milk companies in the Chicago Area will be retarded, discouraged or 
prevented; ""(g) The members of the consuming public, in the Chicago Area and throughout the United States, will be denied the benefits of 
free and open competition in the sale and distribution of packaged milk."" "
139,3," Of course, the courts of appeals have traditionally framed ยง 1651 (a) writs in the form of compulsory injunctions aimed at 
private parties.   E. g., Application of President & Directors of Georgetown College, 118 U. S. App. D. C. 80, 331 F.2d 1000, cert. 
denied,  377 U.S. 978 (1964). See Recent Cases,  77 Harv. L. Rev. 1539, 1542 (1964)."
139,4," For the proposition that the Commission must have express statutory authority to seek injunctions in the courts of appeals two 
cases are cited.  The first,  Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), has no relevance to our problem.  And 
the other,  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Eastman Kodak Co., 274 U.S. 619, 623-625 (1927), even though apposite, has been 
repudiated.  It held that in fashioning a final decree the Commission ""exercises only the administrative functions delegated to it "
140,," by the Act,"" and, therefore, could not order divestiture of laboratories acquired through a stock purchase.  This view was rejected 
in Pan American World Airways, Inc. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 296, 312-313, nn. 17-18 (1963), the Court holding that ""the 
power to order divestiture need not be explicitly included in the powers of an administrative agency to be part of its arsenal of 
authority,"" citing Gilbertville Trucking Co. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 115 (1962)."
140,5," Such a holding would especially interfere with the functions Congress has given the Commission in the merger field.  As THE 
CHIEF JUSTICE stated in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294 (1962), the Congress ""sought to assure the Federal 
Trade Commission and the courts the power to brake this force [business concentration] at its outset and before it gathered 
momentum."" At 317-318.  But without standing to secure injunctive relief, and thereby safeguard its ability to order an effective 
divestiture of acquired properties, the Commission's efforts would be frustrated.  As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS said in  United 
States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 186 (1944): ""The acquisition of a competing theatre terminates at once its competition. . . .  And where businesses have been merged or 
purchased and closed out it is commonly impossible to turn back the clock."" Here the plan of merger itself contemplates the sale of the acquired home delivery milk routes and certain milk plants.  In 
addition, Bowman has retained its cash and securities, with the intention ultimately to distribute them to its stockholders.  If 
consummation of the merger is not restrained, the restoration of Bowman as an effective and viable competitor will obviously be 
impossible by the time a final order is entered.  This is not unusual.  Administrative experience shows that the Commission's 
inability to unscramble merged assets frequently prevents entry of an effective order of divestiture.  E. g., Ekco Products Co., 
Trade Reg. Rep. para. 16,879 (1964) (1963-1965 Transfer Binder), aff'd,  347 F.2d 745 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1965);  Foremost Dairies, 
Inc., 60 F. T. C. 944, order modified per stipulation (C. A. 5th Cir. 1965) (Docket No. 18,815)."
140,6," Cf.   Public Utilities Comm'n v. Capital Transit Co., 94 U. S. App. D. C. 140, 214 F.2d 242, 245 (1954), where the Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gave as one of its reasons for granting an injunction the fact that ""the moving party in 
the litigation was the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia, a governmental agency clothed by Congress with 
special responsibility in the matters involved."" "

Journal, Inc. (C. A. 3d Cir. 1955).  In In the Matter of A. G. Spalding & Bros., Inc. (F. T. C. Docket No. 6478), the Commission 
failed to obtain preliminary relief in the First Circuit, but did get respondent's commitment not to alter the status quo save on 30 
days' notice.  See A. G. Spalding & Bros., Inc. v.  F. T. C., 301 F.2d 585 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1962). The sole instance where injunctive relief was obtained is  Board of Governors v. Transamerica Corp., 184 F.2d 311 (C. A. 9th 
Cir. 1950), cert. denied,  340 U.S. 883. In Transamerica the threatened action would have defeated the Board's jurisdiction 
entirely.  The Board (whose role in ยง 7 enforcement is like the FTC's) argued both in the Court of Appeals and in opposition to 
the petition for certiorari, that if Transamerica were not restrained from disposing of stock holdings the legality of whose 
acquisition was in issue in the administrative proceedings, the effect under the pre-1950 version of ยง 7, as construed by this 
Court in Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Electric Co. v.  F. T. C., 291 U.S. 587, would be to ""oust the Board of its jurisdiction under 
Section 11 of the Clayton Act . . . [and to] defeat the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to enforce or affirm such order 
as the Board might make . . . ."" Government's Brief in Opposition in Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors (Nos. 322 and 
323, October Term, 1950), at pp. 5, 8-9, 15.  See also  United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 339, n. 17, where 
Transamerica appears to have been distinguished from  International Paper, supra, precisely on the ground that the writ there 
was necessary to protect the ""jurisdiction"" both of the agency and of the Court of Appeals -- a conventional use of the All Writs 
Act. "
144,2," On the contrary, the common view is that such authority is entirely lacking.  See, e. g., Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 258 
(1959); Duke, Scope of Relief Under Section 7 of the Clayton Act,  63 Col. L. Rev. 1192, 1206, n. 85 (1963); Note,  79 Harv. L. 
Rev. 391, 404 (1965); Note,  40 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 771 (1965); Comment,  32 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1297 (1957)."
144,3," The Court's opinion asserts, in alleged demonstration of the ""ancillary powers"" which have been inferred on the Commission's 
behalf, that it may bring ""contempt actions in the appropriate court of appeals when the court's enforcement orders were 
violated, though it has no statutory authority in this respect."" The Court errs.  The Commission's powers in this respect are not 
""implied."" The machinery by which the Commission procures compliance with its orders is, and always has been, spelled out by 
statute.  Until 1959, one could with impunity violate an FTC Clayton Act order.  Such an order was not final until the respondent 
sought judicial review and a Court of Appeals granted enforcement.  Disobedience thereafter was a contempt of court.  In the 
event the respondent did not seek review, the Commission was required to ascertain that he was violating its order and then 
proceed, pursuant to express statutory provision (15 U. S. C. ยง 21), to seek enforcement in the courts of appeals.  See 28 U. S. 
C. ยง 2112 (1964 ed.), authorizing the courts of appeals to promulgate rules for enforcement proceedings; and see, e. g., 1st Cir. 
R. 16.  Cf.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 70.  A violation thereafter constituted contempt of court.  The courts declined to infer any more 
convenient substitute for this three-step process.  See  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Henry Broch & Co., 368 U.S. 360, 365;  
Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., 343 U.S. 470, 477-479. The statute was amended in 1959.  An FTC order under the Clayton Act is now final upon expiration of the time allowed 
respondent to seek judicial review.  If he does not appeal the order and violates its terms after it becomes final, the Government 
may proceed, pursuant to statute (15 U. S. C. ยงยง 21 (g) and (l)), to seek civil penalties of up to $ 5,000 per violation. In short, and contrary to the suggestion in the Court's opinion, the Commission's power to enforce compliance with its orders is 
and has been wholly statutory.  Nothing has been left to implication. "

11 Acad. Pol. Sci. Proc. 666 (1925)."
145,5," Where Congress has determined that it is appropriate for the Commission to seek threshold relief in order to protect the public, 
it has expressly so provided -- directing that the Commission proceed in an appropriate tribunal, the United States District 
Courts.  See ยง 13 (a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (Wheeler-Lea amendments), 15 U. S. C. ยง 53 (a) (1964 ed.); ยง 302

146,7," The Court declares that these materials are irrelevant because Congress had before it proposals to authorize the Commission 
itself to issue restraining orders pendente lite or to apply to the district courts for such relief.  But the fact that no one proposed 
and Congress did not consider providing that the Commission might have recourse to the courts of appeals merely emphasizes 
the extreme and extraordinary nature of the device which the Court today creates.  The plain fact, and the short answer, is that 
Congress refused to authorize preliminary restraints at the command of the Commission.  Its refusal to authorize such relief in 
the district courts demonstrates, a fortiori, that it would not create such a remedy in the courts of appeals. The Court also suggests that it would be improper to draw conclusions from congressional inaction.  The inference that I draw 
from congressional refusal to make preliminary injunctive relief available to the FTC is that such inaction confirms (a) that 
Congress in devising the statutory plan did not intend the Commission to have such power, and (b) that the relief sought is not 
consonant with the congressional plan for administering ยง 7.  In fact, this is not a situation where the agency went to Congress in 
the belief that its authority was unclear, or to remove doubts concerning it.  Compare  United States v. Speers, 382 U.S. 266, 
274-275;  United States v. du Pont & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 590;  Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 47-48. Here, there is 
no doubt that the agency sought additional powers, not clarification.  It admitted -- it asserted -- that it had no present authority to 
obtain preliminary relief (see Appendix to this opinion).  It sought what it confessedly did not have.  It sought this not once, but 
repeatedly, over a period of 10 years.  Congress did not grant its request.  Nor should we.  See Fribourg Navig. Co. v.  
Commissioner, 383 U.S. 272, 279-286;  Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403, 412-413."
146,8," Spokesmen for the FTC have frequently acknowledged the availability of such a course.  See, e. g., Hearings before the 
Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. No. 5, pp. 101-102 (testimony of 
Paul Rand Dixon) (1961); Kintner, The Federal Trade Commission in 1960 -- Apologia Pro Vita Nostra, 1961 Antitrust Law 
Symposium 21, 41. The Commission also has on occasion successfully employed the technique of obtaining an agreement of the parties to 
segregate assets so as to facilitate divestiture should it be decreed.  See, e. g., A. G. Spalding & Bros., Inc. v.  F. T. C., 301 F.2d 
585, 588 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1962)."
146,9," For example, in some situations the merger of relatively small competitors may result in creation of an enterprise capable of 
meaningful competition with a company otherwise in unchallenged domination of an industry.  See Brown Shoe Co. v.  United 
States, 370 U.S. 294, 319, and legislative materials therein cited. "
147,10," See Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 248 (1959); Note,  40 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 771, 772, n. 7 (1965), and cases cited therein."
147,11," See note 3, supra. "
148,12," Indeed, there is no certainty that the particular court of appeals selected by the FTC on its application for preliminary relief will 
ever undertake to review an ultimate cease-and-desist order.  Section 11 (c) of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 21 (c), provides 
that a person against whom such an order is entered may appeal ""in the court of appeals . . . for any circuit within which such 
violation occurred or within which such person resides or carries on business."" In the present case, review of any final FTC order 
might lie not in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, but in the Sixth or Eighth Circuit where both Dean and Bowman 
carry on business.  See Transamerica Corp. v.  Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953), cert. denied,  346 U.S. 
901, setting aside an injunction issued by the Ninth Circuit; A. G. Spalding & Bros., Inc. v.  F. T. C., 301 F.2d 585 (C. A. 3d Cir. 
1962), enforcing an FTC order as to which an injunction unsuccessfully had been sought in the First Circuit seven years earlier."

149,15," The Court's opinion today eschews the result in Arrow Transportation and fastens instead on footnote 22,  372 U.S., at 671, 
which merely reserves judgment as to ""decisions which have recognized a limited judicial power to preserve the court's 
jurisdiction or maintain the status quo by injunction pending review of an agency's action through the prescribed statutory 
channels. . . ."" The footnote adds that ""such power has been deemed merely incidental to the courts' jurisdiction to review final 
agency action, and has never been recognized in derogation of such a clear congressional purpose to oust judicial power as that 
manifested in the Interstate Commerce Act."" (Emphasis supplied.) The cases cited demonstrate the conventional use of the 
extraordinary writs referred to in the footnote.  In Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v.  F. C. C., 316 U.S. 4, a stay was issued ancillary 
to an appeal already taken pursuant to statute.  Its purpose was to suspend, pending action by the court in which the appeal was 
lodged, changes authorized by completed agency action.  For the thoroughly conventional nature of Transamerica, also cited in 
the footnote, see note 1, supra."

that courts have power to preserve the status quo while administrative proceedings are in progress, relates instead to the power 
of a bankruptcy court to enjoin the sale of collateral pledged by a debtor. "
151,17," The Commission's estimate in the present case that its proceedings would endure for at least one year seems 
unprecedentedly optimistic.  In A. G. Spalding & Bros., Inc. v.  F. T. C., 301 F.2d 585 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1962), where the FTC 
unsuccessfully sought an injunction pendente lite, more than seven years elapsed between complaint and enforcement.

under the Clayton Act. "
165,4," In contrast, the Bank Merger Act of 1960 involved in Philadelphia Bank provided for no hearing whatsoever."

] In granting or withholding consent under this subsection, the Comptroller, the Board, or the Corporation, as 
the case may be, shall consider the financial history and condition of each of the banks involved, the adequacy of its capital 
structure, its future earnings prospects, the general character of its management, the convenience and needs of the 
community to be served, and whether or not its corporate powers are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  In the 
case of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of liabilities, the appropriate agency shall also take 
into consideration the effect of the transaction on competition (including any tendency toward monopoly), and shall not 
approve the transaction unless, after considering all of such factors, it finds the transaction to be in the public interest. . . ."" Although counsel for the plaintiff here has argued that the factors set forth in ยง 3 differ from the considerations under ยง 7 of the 
Clayton Act, the Attorney General himself, in commenting prior to recent amendment of the Bank Merger Act on that Act's similar 
factors, stated in a letter of September 24, 1965, printed in the 1966 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News at Page 
340: ""While there are those in the banking industry and, indeed, in Government who differ with me, I strongly believe that 
objective analysis will disclose that in actual practice the differences in the standards applied by the banking agencies and 
by the courts, if any, have been overstated.  In fact, the Supreme Court in the leading case has made it clear that all or 
most of the factors specified in the Bank Merger Act are relevant to a determination under section 7 of the Clayton Act or 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. . . ."" (Page 341) and in a letter dated January 5, 1966, printed at Page 346: "" . . . I should like to repeat here my strong belief that the differences, if any, in the standards applied to bank mergers by 
the courts and the standards applied by the agencies have been overstated. . . ."" (Page 347) "
166,6," The Bank Merger Act of 1960 contained no provision whatsoever for judicial review, a fact which, together with its lack of 
provision for hearing was considered significant by the Supreme Court in Philadelphia Bank (See Page 351 of that opinion, 374 
U.S. 321). When that Act was recently amended, provision for review similar to the Bank Holding Company provision was 
proposed.  With respect to that provision, the Attorney General stated in the letter of September 24, 1965, referred to previously: 
(Page 342, 1966 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News): ""I am opposed to particular procedures set forth in H.R. 11011.  The bill provides for review in a court of appeals on the 
basis of a 'record' upon which the order complained of was entered, and further provides that on review the findings of the 
agency as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.  This type of review is normally used for 
determinations by such agencies as the Federal Power Commission and the Federal Trade Commission who, pursuant to 
the Administrative Procedure Act, have held full public adversary hearings on a public record, with full opportunities to all 
parties to develop evidence as to rebut evidence produced by the others.  No such procedures for the full development of a 
record are provided for by the Bank Merger Act or by any current proposal, and indeed there are important considerations 
that make the more summary handling of merger applications particularly appropriate.  Since the vast majority of 
applications raise no serious problems of an antitrust nature, there would seem to be no little point in subjecting all merger 
applications before the regulatory authorities to all of the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in order to lay 
the groundwork for court review in those few instances where serious questions of competition are presented. Consequently, while I am sympathetic to efforts to clarify through legislation the application of antitrust law to banks, I 
believe that the current practice, whereby the Department of Justice institutes proceedings in Federal district courts against 
mergers which it believes to be unlawful, should be allowed to continue; so that there could be a trial de novo of all issues 
in any such suit."" This statement seems to us to clearly infer the Attorney General's belief that such a provision for review such as in the Bank 
Holding Company Act would abolish the duty of the Attorney General under ยง 15 of the Clayton Act to commence an action in 
district court concerning approved bank mergers and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the court to entertain such an action."
166,7, The Bank Merger Act of 1960 had no savings clause. 
170,8," There is no reason in this discussion to cover other problems facing Congress, such as interests by bank holding companies in 
nonbanking companies, etc."
170,9," In considering this question it is well to remember that in 1955 and 1956, when the Bank Holding Company Act was being 
considered, no action involving bank holding companies had been commenced under ยง 15 by the Department of Justice to 
enforce ยง 7, and only one proceeding, the Transamerica case, supra, had been commenced under ยง 11, which proceeding 
resulted in a determination that a violation of ยง 7 had not been proved.  Also, the recent Supreme Court decisions regarding the 
scope of ยง 7 were of course not available."
170,10," See also the statement of Governor Robertson at Page 112 of the House Committee Hearings: ""As was stated this morning, there are really two gaps in existing legislation.  One is with respect to expansion.  You have 
no control over it whatsoever.  The other relates to combining of different businesses under the same roof.  There is no 
control there.  Those gaps should be covered and this legislation purports to do that."" "
173,11," At Page 325 of the Senate Subcommittee Hearings Mr. Thomson stated: ""There may be another and more simple method of dealing with this question.  Expansion of bank holding companies is 
primarily a question of competition and monopoly. Acquisitions by bank holding companies are subject to the Sherman Act 
and, as recently decided in the Transamerica litigation, to the Clayton Act insofar as stock acquisitions are concerned. There are now pending in Congress S. 2075 introduced by Senator Sparkman and H.R. 5948 introduced by Mr. Celler 
which would complete the coverage by bringing asset acquisitions within section 7 of the Clayton Act. This problem might 
and perhaps should be dealt with directly as one of monopoly and competition.  The indirect approach adopted by H.R. 
6227 has resulted in a bill which will lead to confusion in the field of bank regulation, unnecessary conflict between State 
and Federal authorities, and restrictions on normal growth far more severe than those of the antitrust laws."" and during the House Committee Hearings, R. M. Evans, former Governor of the Federal Reserve System, stated: ""During all the years that the Board was working with bank holding company legislation, and all the years they were working 
with bank holding companies, we always had it in our minds that in the Clayton Antitrust Act we had some powers that 
could compel these people to observe the rules and regulations of the administrative body.  It was only after we tried the 
case and submitted it to the courts, and the courts turned it down, that the question became really urgent, because as of 
today there is no regulation available, no regulating power available to the Board of Governors to stop the increase in bank 
holding company acquisitions of independent banks. Just to give you one little paragraph from the bank holding company hearings on S. 76 and S. 1118, we quote from the 
court's decision: 'We agree that this quantitative analysis -' that is simply a statistical analysis to show the immense concentration of power in this Transamerica Corp. - 'we agree that this quantitative analysis discloses a tremendous concentration of banking capital and thereby of economic 
power in the hands of the Transamerica group, which may be unwise and against sound public policy.  It may well be in the 
public interest to curb the growth of this banking colossus by appropriate legislative or administrative action.  This, however, 
is not for us to decide.  Our only question is whether the theory upon which the Board based its decision meets the legal 
tests which are required under section 7 of the Clayton Act, to determine whether Transamerica's bank stock acquisitions 
tend to create a monoply of commercial banking. We are compelled to agree with Transamerica that they do not.' So the court told the banking industry, and they told the Congress, that the Clayton Antitrust Act, under which these 
hearings were held, is not an adequate tool to accomplish the result that I have an idea Congress intended it should take 
care of in the basic legislation."" (Page 507)"
173,*," * * ""The worst part about the whole hearing was that when this law came up for a test in court it was found to be inadequate to 
do the job it was supposed to do.  That is the great tragedy of the whole Transamerica hearing. "" (Page 508) and the following colloquy took place (Pages 509-510): ""THE CHAIRMAN. You think the Clayton Antitrust Act is entirely inadequate to meet the situation, don't you? MR. EVANS. There is no longer the slightest question in my mind, Mr. Chairman. I was the hearing officer.  I recommended 
the divestment of this whole thing.  I thought the evidence was overwhelmingly that way and yet the court said that we did 
not have the authority to make our position stick.  So the thing is inadequate and ineffective. THE CHAIRMAN. And if there is any regulation of holding companies, it ought to be written into the banking law which 
directly affects these institutions and governs their activity. MR. EVANS. Absolutely.  I think it is basically wrong to permit any group of people to evade the law. "" "
174,12," In this way, Congress could insure examination by an enforcement agency of the competitive effect of each acquisition. Until 
passage of the Bank Holding Company Act, despite the existence of the Clayton Act with its dual enforcement provisions, no 
such examination inevitably occurred.  As stated previously, no action and only one proceeding involving bank holding 
companies had been commenced charging violation of ยง 7 of the Clayton Act."
174,13," See footnote 5, supra."
174,14," As footnote 22 on pages 344 and 345 of the Philadelphia Bank case reveals, repeal by implication of enforcement provisions 
of the antitrust laws is not unique. The Supreme Court there stated: HN14[
] ""Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 21, vests the FRB with authority to enforce ยง 7 'where applicable to banks.' This provision has been in the Act since it was first passed in 1914 and was not changed by the 1950 amendments.  
The Bank Merger Act of 1960, assigning roles in merger applications to the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency as 
well as to the FRB, plainly supplanted, we think, whatever authority the FRB may have acquired under ยง 11, by virtue of the 
amendment of ยง 7, to enforce ยง 7 against bank mergers. Since the Bank Merger Act applies only to mergers, 
consolidations, acquisitions of assets, and assumptions of liabilities but not to outright stock acquisitions, the FRB's 
authority under ยง 11 as it existed before the 1950 amendment of ยง 7 remains unaffected."""
174,15," It might be argued, to remove this absurdity, that the Bank Holding Company Act repealed the Board's authority to enforce the 
Clayton Act by implication rather than repealing ยง 15.  We believe it would be equally absurd to hold that Congress, in directing 
the Board to examine proposed acquisitions in the light of the factors specified in the Bank Holding Company Act, intended to 
divest it of the authority and duty to enforce ยง 7."
174,16," In other words Congress abandoned the theretofore ineffective system of dual enforcement as to acquisitions covered by the 
Bank Holding Company Act in favor of required examination and enforcement by the Board prior to the acquisitions. "
175,17," As a matter of practice, however, it appears that the Board does hold hearings even though no disapproval by the Comptroller 
or state banking authority is filed.  See Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans & Trust Co. (1964) 
379 U.S. 411, at page 416, 13 L. Ed. 2d 386, 85 S. Ct. 551."
175,18," In this case the plaintiff deliberately chose not to attack the defendant holding company's acquisition of stock of Marshall & 
Ilsley Bank and Northern.  When the holding company sought approval of acquisition of the stock of Commerce, the Department 
of Justice filed statements with the Board opposing the acquisition and in a petition for reconsideration urged its position that the 
acquisition violated ยง 7 of the Clayton Act. The state banking authorities had recommended that the Board approve the 
acquisitions. "
177,19," With respect to that section, House Report No. 609 states at Page 34: ""Section 12.  This section contains a savings clause to make clear that nothing in this act shall be construed as approving 
any act, action, or conduct in violation of existing law or constituting a defense in antitrust or monopolistic proceedings."" and Senate Report No. 1095 states at Page 19: ""The bill provides that none of its provisions are to be construed as approving any act, action or conduct in violation of 
existing law. It also provides that nothing in the bill shall constitute a defense to any action, suit, or proceeding pending or 
later instituted on account of any prohibited antitrust or monopolistic act, action or conduct.  In the opinion of your 
committee, approvals granted and action permitted under the provisions of this bill are not to supersede the provisions of 
other Federal laws, particularly those designed to control monopoly or break up trusts.  For example, the Clayton Act has 
been judicially determined to apply to banks.  Under the provisions of that act, the Federal Reserve Board has an 
administrative role to play in determining whether banks comply with the requirements of the Clayton Act. Under the 
provisions of this bill, any action taken by the Federal Reserve Board in accordance with its terms is not to interfere in any 
manner with the performance by the Board of such functions as may be assigned to it under the Clayton Act."" "

however, one line which we can draw with assurance that we follow the congressional purpose.  We know that Congress 
feared the concentrated power of business organizations to dominate markets and prices.  It intended to outlaw business "

186,1, It will be sufficient for most purposes to refer hereafter to Burlington and Parklane as the defendants. 
187,2," Parklane and its president have made no formal motion, but have filed a brief memorandum offered ""as evidencing their 
joinder"" in the Burlington motion.  Plaintiffs, pointing out that the motion papers are drafted with focused concern only for the 
Burlington movants, resist the proposed joinder. Since the motion is being denied, it is not vital to decide how many of the 
defendants may claim a share in the result."
187,3," The complaint (par. 17) adds alleged factual detail to support the quoted conclusion.  We accept this conclusion, like others, for 
now. Cf.  United States v. DuPont & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 395 & n. 22, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)."
187,4," Four paragraphs of the first count, detailing discriminatory pricing and other practices by Burlington in favor of Parklane, rest 
explicitly on the Robinson-Patman Act.  The first of these (par. 38) refers to discriminations by Burlington ""between plaintiffs, on 
the one hand, and defendant Parklane and others * * *."" Defendants say in their Memorandum that this reference to ""plaintiffs"" 
must be an inadvertence because (1) it is the only place in the long complaint where plaintiffs are suggested to be Burlington 
customers and (2) the paragraph is copied from the complaint in another pending action (S.D.N.Y., 63 Civ. 2043) brought by 
Albert Hayes and others against the defendants herein.  Defendants' observation is highly plausible; it is not mentioned in the 
thorough memoranda for plaintiffs. "
188,5," The movants assert lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as failure to state claims in counts I and IV.  They make 
no separate points under this branch of the motion, seemingly implying that, since federal jurisdiction is claimed only under the 
Clayton Act, failure of the claim on the merits inevitably entails failure of jurisdiction.  While this assumed premise is dubious, 
Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 90 L. Ed. 939, 66 S. Ct. 773 (1946), it makes no difference.  The conclusion that the motion must be

agreement or understanding covering any wages, hours or other conditions of work applicable to employees covered by this 
Contract on any basis other than those specified in this Contract or any applicable District Contract.  The United Mine Workers of 
America will diligently perform and enforce without discrimination or favor the conditions of this paragraph and all other terms 
and conditions of this Contract and will use and exercise its continuing best efforts to obtain full compliance therewith by each 
and all the parties signatory thereto. B.  It is recognized that when signatory operators mine, prepare, or procure or acquire under subcontract arrangements, 
bituminous coal mined under terms and conditions less favorable than those provided for in this contract, they deprive 
employees of employment opportunities, employment conditions and other benefits which these employees are entitled to have 
safeguarded, stabilized and protected.  Accordingly, the Operators agree that all bituminous coal mined, produced, or prepared 
by them, or any of them, or procured or acquired by them or any of them under a subcontract arrangement, shall be or shall 
have been mined or produced under terms and conditions which are as favorable to the employees as those provided for in this 
contract. ""Procured or acquired under a subcontract arrangement"" means any contract, lease, license, agreement, arrangement or 
understanding pursuant to which the signatory operator acquires coal, either as principal or agent, directly or indirectly from a 
producer other than such signatory for delivery to a person other than such signatory. The obligation assumed hereunder shall not affect any agreement in effect as of the date of execution of this contract: Provided, 
however, that any operator signatory hereto who is a party to any agreement inconsistent with the obligations assumed 
hereunder shall not maintain such inconsistent agreement in effect beyond the first date at which such agreement may be 
terminated by him in accordance with its terms. The Operators signatory to this agreement shall so conduct their own operations (whether operated directly or indirectly, or 
through subsidiaries or affiliates) so as to fully comply with their obligations under this Clause. The obligation of each Operator 
signatory hereto, which is several and not joint, to fully perform all the conditions in this paragraph B contained, shall be a direct 
and continuing obligation of said Operator during the life of this Agreement. As a part of the consideration for this Agreement, the Operators signatory hereto agree that this Clause covers the operation of 
all the coal lands, coal producing or coal preparation facilities owned or held under lease by them, or any of them, or by any 
subsidiary or affiliate at the date of this Agreement, or acquired during its term which may hereafter (during the term of this 
Agreement) be put into production or use.  The said Operators agree that they will not lease, license, or contract out any coal 
lands, coal producing or coal preparation facilities as a subterfuge for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Clause.C.  
There is hereby established a Joint Industry Contract Committee composed of six (6) members, three (3) of whom shall be 
appointed and may be removed by the Union and three (3) of whom shall be appointed and may be removed by the Operators. 
Such appointments shall be made and notice thereof given to the proper parties hereto as expeditiously as possible and not later 
than thirty (30) days after the date of the execution of this Contract.  In the event of resignation, removal, death, inability or 
unwillingness to serve of any of the members of the Committee, the Union shall appoint the successor or successors of the 
members originally appointed by it and the Operators shall appoint the successor or successors of the members originally 
appointed by them.  Action which may be required of the Operators for the appointment of any member of the Joint Industry 
Contract Committee representing them may be taken by those Operators who, at the time, are signatories hereto.  Authorization, 
approval or ratification of Operators representing fifty-one (51) per cent or more of the coal produced for use or sale during the 
calendar year previous to that in which such action is taken shall be sufficient to bind all Operators. The Joint Industry Contract Committee may appoint such Joint District Contract Committees in such districts or groups of 
districts as it may determine, such district committees to consist of such numbers of members, half of whom shall represent the 
Union and half of whom shall represent the Operators in that district or groups of districts, as the Industry Committee shall deem 
advisable.  The Joint District Contract Committees shall assist the Joint Industry Contract Committee in making any 
investigations hereunder. The Joint Industry Contract Committee and the Joint District Committees, when authorized by and under the supervision of the 
Industry Committee, may employ such clerical and other employees as are required for the performance of their duties 
hereunder.  Expenses of all Committees shall be borne equally by the Union and the Operators. D.  Within one hundred and twenty days after the execution of this contract and each six months thereafter each Operator 
signatory hereto shall certify in writing to the Joint District Contract Committee for the District where he maintains his principal "
239,," place of business where such a District Committee exists, or to the Joint Industry Contract Committee where no District 
Committee exists, that he is in full compliance with all the terms and conditions of this contract or any applicable District 
Agreement.  Within one hundred and twenty days after the execution of this Agreement, and each six months thereafter each 
Union District President shall certify in writing to his Joint District Contract Committee, if one exists, or, if none exists, to the Joint 
Industry Contract Committee, a complete list of all Operators and Mines engaged in the production of bituminous coal within his 
district whose operations are under contract with the Union.  No operator may be found to be in violation of this Protective Wage 
Clause with respect to any coal produced by another operator who is listed on the Contract list to be furnished by United Mine 
Workers of America under this paragraph, unless and until such operator is notified in writing by the Joint Industry Contract 
Committee that such operator has failed to comply with the provisions of this Clause and such failure has not been corrected. E.  Any party signatory to this contract shall have the right at any time to file a complaint with the Joint Industry Contract 
Committee alleging a violation of any provision of this Protective Wage Clause.  In the event such a charge is filed it shall be the 
duty of the Joint Industry Contract Committee to investigate and determine the facts with respect to such alleged violation.  Any 
determination by the Joint Industry Committee that a violation of this Clause has occurred may be made only upon the 
concurrence therein of a majority of the membership of the Committee.  Notice by the Committee to the affected party, 
opportunity for the party to be heard, and failure promptly to effect full compliance after a finding of violation by the Committee 
shall be deemed a condition precedent to any final determination that a violation of this Clause has occurred.  Findings made by 
the Joint Committee, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding, and shall 
constitute a final determination as to the fact of a violation.  Failure or refusal of United Mine Workers or any Operator signatory 
hereto to comply with a final determination by the Committee of a violation of Paragraphs (A) or (B) of this Clause may be 
deemed a violation of this Agreement. The Mine Workers agree to make available to the Joint Industry Contract Committee all contracts, agreements, or 
understandings entered into by the Mine Workers with any person engaged in the production of bituminous coal, and further 
agree to appear before the Committee on request by it and inform the Committee on such other related and pertinent matters as 
shall be essential to the Committee's investigation of an alleged violation of this Protective Wage Clause.  Each Operator 
signatory hereto agrees to appear before the Committee on request by it and inform the Committee as to the source and 
quantity of coal produced or purchased or otherwise acquired, payment of wages to, and hours and working conditions of 
classified employees, payments to the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund, and such other related 
and pertinent matters as shall be essential to the Committee's investigation of an alleged violation of this Protective Wage 
Clause. The authority of the Committee is restricted to the subject matter covered in this Protective Wage Clause and shall not extend to 
disputes concerning the administration of the Contract which are of the type that have heretofore been processed under the 
grievance procedures provided for in the Section of the Contract entitled ""Settlement of Local and District Disputes""; nor shall the

296,1," The record before the court on the instant Motion for Summary Judgment consists of the plaintiff's Complaint (Document 1), the 
Answer of defendant J-M (Document 8), plaintiff's statement of contentions (Document 84), defendant J-M's statement of 
contentions (Document 93), the affidavits filed in connection with K & M's Motion for Summary Judgment (Documents 33, 36, 38, 
and the three affidavits attached to Document 34), the affidavits filed in connection with Certain-teed's Motion for Summary 
Judgment (Documents 52-63, 68-70), the affidavits attached to Document 87, except those portions excluded by the rulings in 
this Memorandum Opinion, including Appendix A, the affidavits filed by the Government as Documents 101-104, 110-113, the 
affidavit of Roy J. Barloga (attached to Document 114), the depositions taken by the Government (Documents 94-96, 100, 105-
109, 121, 126), the affidavit filed by the Government in support of its Motion for stay of discovery proceedings (Document 19), 
and the transcript of the argument on the Motion for Summary Judgment, insofar as it contains rulings (Document 125).  Also, 
the parties have stipulated that the court may, in disposing of J-M's Motion for Summary Judgment, consider the testimony given 
at the criminal trial ( United States v. Johns-Manville Corporation et al., 231 F. Supp. 690), exhibits identified under oath at that 
trial, and GX-3004, which was marked for identification at that trial at N.T. 2658, to the extent that such testimony, exhibits and 
documents are relevant to this Motion (Document 99)."
296,2," With regard to the Government's motion (Document 114) for reconsideration of the pre-trial order of April 14, 1966 (Document 
92) to permit consideration of the affidavit of Roy J. Barloga (attached to Document 114), the court informed counsel at the oral 
argument of this Motion that this affidavit would be considered on J-M's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document 125, p. 3). "
297,3," Actually the direct evidence of price-fixing activity extends only to the middle of 1958.  According to the testimony of the 
participants, the last meeting between representatives of J-M and K & M to discuss list prices for a-c pipe occurred no later than 
the summer of 1957 (N.T. 3043-4, 4959-63, 4966-9).  The most recent documentary evidence of price-fixing activity is a letter 
dated in August of 1956 (GX-726).  The last telephone conversation between J-M and K & M representatives to discuss the 
prices to be bid on specific jobs occurred no later than the middle of 1958 (N.T. 3087)."
297,4," The Government points to GX-511 and GX-546 as evidence that the conspiracy persisted through 1960.  GX-546 (which bears 
the printed date 6/1/60) is an official K & M price list for an area that corresponds with J-M's Atlanta District.  GX-511 is a price 
sheet prepared by W. D. Gibson, the manager of J-M's Atlanta District (N.T. 5379). It is not an official J-M price sheet; rather, it 
represents a reduction from the then prevailing J-M prices (N.T. 5380).  Since GX-511 also bears the date 6/1/60 and since the 
prices on GX-511 and 546 are identical, the Government contends that these price sheets can only be the result of collusion.  
However, Mr. Gibson testified that the decision to go off book was made sometime between May 15 and June 1, 1960, and that 
the actual typing and mailing of the list may have occurred as early as May 20, 1960 (N.T. 5386).  Thus, these two price sheets 
were not necessarily issued simultaneously.  Moreover, Mr. Gibson flatly denied that GX-511 was the result of collusion with K & 
M (N.T. 5382). The Government argues that the affidavit of William J. Hogan shows that there is a continuing conspiracy between J-M and 
Certain-teed to fix prices on a-c pipe. Paragraph 20 of that affidavit is as follows: ""The prices quoted by Johns-Manville and Certain-teed are about ten percent higher where imported pipe is not permitted 
to compete.  Following the adoption by Tucson of the testing in the United States requirement, the prices quoted by Johns-
Manville and Certain-teed rose to their published list prices.  When TUSI began operation of its local testing facility, the 
prices of domestic pipe dropped to the previous level."" Mr. Hogan does not say that J-M's and Certain-teed's prices are the same.  Even if they are, his statement is not inconsistent 
with a pattern of behavior in which Certain-teed raises its prices after J-M has done so.  Moreover, the raising and lowering of 
prices depending on whether there is competition from the generally cheaper foreign pipe would seem to be normal competitive 
behavior.  Although consideration of Mr. Hogan's deposition (Document 126) is not necessary for the above conclusion, it is 
noted that pages 65-105 of that deposition fully support the above construction of Mr. Hogan's affidavit. "
298,5," This was admitted by Government counsel at the oral argument on this Motion for Summary Judgment (Document 125 at pp. 
75-76)."
298,6," See footnote 3, supra. "
299,7," Percentage figures in excess of 100% are due to the fact that there was frequently a time lag between the report that the order 
had been secured and the submission of the price request on the order.  For example, the report that the order had been 
secured might be received at J-M headquarters at the end of 1960 and so would be considered a 1960 securement.  The price 
request on that order, however, might not be received until the beginning of 1961 and so would be reflected as a 1961 price 
request (N.T. 12,349-50).  Although this means that the percentage figures given above for particular years are not completely 
accurate, it can safely be said that during the period 1958-1961 J-M made about half of its a-c pipe sales at off-book prices."
299,8," There is no merit to the Government's contention that J-M's activities with respect to pipe specifications are probative to show 
participation in a price-fixing conspiracy. Much of the activity to secure specifications was constitutionally protected under United 
Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), and Eastern R. Presidents 
Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961). Also, the evidence of actual market 
activity is contrary to a conclusion that domestic a-c pipe prices were the result of collusion. "
300,9," The Government also alleges that J-M and K & M engaged in certain predatory price reductions in connection with this phase 
of the case (brief for plaintiff, p. 30).  The situation referred to is the alleged simultaneous issuance of identical price sheets in 
the Southeastern United States on June 1, 1960.  It has been seen above that the Government's evidence on these price sheets 
fails to show concerted action by J-M and K & M.  See note 4, supra."
300,10," It is noted that the record fails to support the claim that a patent suit without merit was instituted against an importer of Italit a-c 
pipe in 1960.  The United States District Court hearing the case upheld J-M's claim of infringement and the fact that this ruling 
was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit does not make the ruling groundless.  Although the 
Government, at page 39 of its brief (Document 133), cited ""Feskoe Aff."" in support of its argument on this point, this affidavit 
(Document 63) does not mention patents. The Orth affidavit attached to Document 87 covers some recent discussions 
concerning patents by J-M, as well as certain agreements on this subject."
300,11," It is noted that there is no testimony in the record that Mr. Orth specifically threatened the use of Mexican-made a-c pipe as a 
""fighting brand."" Mr. Gerin stated at page 38 of his deposition (Document 121) that Mr. Orth mentioned ""that J-M had bought 
some interest in Asbestolit and would sell Asbestolit in this country,"" but he did not remember the context in which this statement 
was made.  There was later read to him isolated questions and answers which he had given to a grand jury on February 8, 1962 
(p. 91 of Document 121), as follows (p. 103 of Document 121): "" Mr. Raymond Carson: That was page 1316. ""Q. At the same page: ""'Q. Did he say outright that he would fight the European manufacturers with Mexican Pipe?' ""Page 1317: ""'A. He didn't say with Mexican pipe. He said he would fight us, and later he talked about Mexican pipe, so you could 
connect the two ideas.' ""Did you so testify? ""A. Yes."" Since plaintiff refused to make the grand jury testimony available to defendant (p. 106 of Document 121), the deposition was 
concluded without any cross-examination by defendant concerning the above excerpts from the grand jury testimony (pp. 106-7 
of Document 121) and such vague grand jury testimony, which has not been subject to cross-examination, could not be the 
basis of a finding affecting defendant's rights under these circumstances, particularly when it was taken two days before the 
hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment. "
301,12," Mr. Orth denied that he made any such proposals (N.T. 13,273, 13,279, 13,281).  His testimony is supported by that of Mr. 
Gerin of Belgian Eternit, who was also at the meeting (Gerin deposition, pp. 35-42).  Mr. Orth testified that, to the contrary, the 
Europeans were seeking a guarantee of a $5,000,000 American market (N.T. 13,247-9, 13,273, 13,282)."
301,13," Mr. Orth testified that this meeting was at his request and lasted for about 20 or 30 minutes.  Mr. Bateman had just arrived by 
plane from Majorca (N.T. 13,343-5)."
301,14," See note 12, supra."
301,15," Mr. Koons' testimony that Orth told him after the Paris meeting that he had been to London to see Mr. Soothill, a director of 
Turner & Newall, before the Paris meeting is not persuasive since (a) this testimony is inconsistent with Mr. Koons' testimony 
before the grand jury, wherein he made no mention of a statement by Orth that he had seen Mr. Soothill before the meeting 
(N.T. 9808-9810), and (b) he had an interest in the outcome of this litigation due to his company's pending treble damage suit 
(N.T. 9354-7).  Mr. Orth denied going to London before the Paris meeting (N.T. 13,285).  His testimony, supported by that of Mr. 
Frazza, is that he flew directly from New York to Paris (N.T. 13,276, 11,740-2)."
301,16," It is noted that when, on the defendants' motion for judgment of acquittal in the criminal case, the undersigned ruled that the 
jury could find from the above testimony of Mr. Costa and other evidence that the activities at the foreign meetings were carried 
on pursuant to a conspiracy between J-M and K & M, the defendants had not introduced any evidence.  In addition, the record 
did not at that time contain the affidavits attached to Document 87 or the several depositions that the Government has filed since 
the criminal trial. "
302,17," It is noted that at the time of this court's first ruling on the relevant market issue, only the Government's evidence had been 
introduced, since that ruling was on the defendants' motions for judgment of acquittal.  During the presentation of their case, the 
defendants substantially increased the quantum of evidence showing a highly competitive situation among the various types of 
pipe. There is a concise review of some of this evidence at pages 110-115 of the defendant's brief.  See especially, the citations 
to the many price requests in which the reason given by the district manager for going ""off-book"" is competition from some other 
kind of pipe."
302,18," In his deposition, Mr. Hogan testified that within the Arizona sales territory there were ""almost countless"" bids where only a-c 
pipe was involved (Document 126, pp. 112-113).  This evidence may show that a-c pipe constitutes a relevant market in Arizona 
or the southwestern United States, but it does not show that this is true for the country as a whole.  See, also, United States v. 
Johns-Manville Corporation, 245 F. Supp. 74, 82, n. 9 (E.D. Pa. 1965). "
303,19," N.T. 2310, 2553, 8157, 8638, 13,900."
303,20," That footnote reads: "" n.3 It would of course still be within the province of the trial judge to admit this evidence, if he deemed it probative and not 
unduly prejudicial, under the 'established judicial rule of evidence that testimony of prior or subsequent transactions, which for 
some reason are barred from forming the basis for a suit, may nevertheless be introduced if it tends reasonably to show the 
purpose and character of the particular transactions under scrutiny."" "
304,21," J-M and K & M representatives on Committee C-17, the a-c pipe specification section of ASTM, were asked by the committee 
chairman to collaborate on specifications to be submitted to the committee as a whole for approval (N.T. 13,155-6). "
313,1," The reservation contained in the last paragraph of the Covenant Not To Sue dated March 11, 1964 is as follows: ""This Covenant Not To Sue and all other Covenants, representations, and warranties by the Covenantors, and each of 
them, herein contained, shall not apply to any claim, cause of action, right of action, or claim for relief which Covenantors, 
or either of them, may ever have had or which they, or either of them, may now have against any persons, firms or 
corporations other than the Covenantees, all of which claims, causes of actions, rights of action, or claims for relief, are 
hereby expressly reserved by and to the Covenantors."" "
314,2," Comment ""d"" of the Restatement in reference to the above quoted Section 885(1) states as follows: ""d.  Limits and effect of rule.  A covenant not to sue clearly indicates by its form that it is not intended to discharge the 
liability of other tortfeasors jointly liable. On the other hand, a document in the usual form of a release given to one of them 
is construed as intended to discharge all claims for the tort and operates to discharge others also liable for the same harm.  
If, however, there is language in the release which manifests that the releasor intended to preserve his rights against the "
315,," others, effect is given to this manifestation. If such a manifestation does not appear upon the document containing the 
release, a rule analogous to the parol evidence rule prevents giving effect to the intention of the parties that the other 
tortfeasor shall not be discharged.  Where the discharge is by an oral agreement, the manifested intent of the parties 
controls."" "
321,1," It was noted in the congressional debates that this section referred to three so-called ""post Philadelphia cases - in Nashville, 
San Francisco and St. Louis - where mergers were consummated after that [Philadelphia] decision."" This is the San Francisco 
case there referred to.  The Philadelphia case referred to is United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 10 L. Ed. 
2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715. In that connection reference was also made to United States v. First Nat. Bank of Lexington, 376 U.S. 
665, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1, 84 S. Ct. 1033. "
322,2," Representative Ashley, one of the members principally in charge of the bill in the House, stated (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 
2339): ""The bill would require the court to use the new standards of the bill in all . . . 'post Philadelphia' cases now pending in 
court. . . . The courts have repeatedly held that under the antitrust laws the social or economic benefits of a given merger cannot 
even be considered."" The Congressman then quoted from the statement to that effect in the Philadelphia case: ""It is a primary 
purpose of the bill to assure that the courts will never again dismiss as irrelevant the question of the needs of a community . . . . 
[The] merger must be shown to be sufficiently beneficial in meeting the needs of the community to be served that, on balance, it 
may properly be regarded as in the public interest."" During the same discussion Rep. Stanton, a member of the committee in 
charge of the bill, (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 2343) stated: ""[It] was the expressed purpose and intent of Congress when it 
passed the Bank Merger Act in 1960 to make certain that control of bank mergers should be in the hands of the appropriate 
banking supervisory agencies, and that while the competitive effects of a proposed merger should be considered, they were not 
to be given a predominant position.  These standards were repudiated by the Supreme Court in the Philadelphia National Bank 
and the Lexington Bank cases in which the Court decided that the Justice Department had the final say in bank mergers. 
Contrary to the intent of Congress, the bank regulatory authorities were relegated to advisory roles. These provisions . . . reinstate a measure of antitrust consideration which was lacking in the Senate bill, and they provide a 
banking standard that may allow economic assistance to a community even though a merger tends to lessen competition in that 
community.  It is this statutory balance that was intended in 1960. . . . "
323,," The . . . bill . . . directs the courts to apply the banking standards as well as the competitive standards in any judicial proceeding 
attacking an approved merger transaction . . . it . . . gives these standards equal weight as between economic and competitive 
circumstances and it assures this equilibrium throughout the entire review procedure."""
323,3," In an effort to find some legislative history to bolster its position that this Act made no changes in the law, the Government has 
inserted in its brief some quotations from the remarks of individual Congressmen during floor debate.  Taken out of context, as 
they are, they prove nothing.  It is true that the wording of ยง 18(c) (5) emphasized and restated the requirement that the 
Comptroller, and the reviewing courts, take into consideration the antitrust laws. This was noted in debate, but it was also noted 
that this Act definitely and positively added a new standard.  As stated in the House Report of supplemental views of 
Congressman Ottinger who helped draft the bill: ""It also assures that banking services available to meet the convenience and 
needs of a community are considered in all cases and will prevail where they clearly outweigh nonmonopolistic anti-competitive 
effects of a merger."" Counsel's quotations from the debate ignore the rule stated in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 474-475, 65 
L. Ed. 349, 41 S. Ct. 172, as follows: ""By repeated decisions of this court it has come to be well established that the debates in 
Congress expressive of the views and motives of individual members are not a safe guide, and hence may not be resorted to, in 
ascertaining the meaning and purpose of the law-making body. . . . But reports of committees of House or Senate stand upon a 
more solid footing, and may be regarded as an exposition of the legislative intent in a case where otherwise the meaning of a 
statute is obscure. . . . And this has been extended to include explanatory statements in the nature of a supplemental report 
made by the committee member in charge of a bill in course of passage."" Counsel have largely confined their quotations to 
those from Congressmen Weltner and Todd, who opposed the bill, and from Congressman Patman who bitterly fought the 
legislation and finally, through a face-saving compromise, introduced the bill, while stating that if he alone were writing the bill, he 
""would be against it as a matter of principle."" (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 2357.) Counsel's choice of makers of remarks is not 
very persuasive. "
324,4," It is this officer who must act if the acquiring, assuming or resulting bank is to be a national bank.  Where a state bank is to be 
the resulting one, the decision is to be made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In other cases, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is to make the decision. "
325,5," It will be noticed that the standards of ยง 5 are to be applied in granting or refusing leave to merge in the future.  The 
contemplated action ""looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule, to be applied thereafter to . . . 
some part of those subject to power,"" as fully as the establishment of railroad rates in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 
U.S. 210, 226, 53 L. Ed. 150, 29 S. Ct. 67. It involves a determination and establishment of a public policy. See Finfrock, ""Trial de Novo - Panacea?"" in 14 Baylor Law Review, 135, where the Texas cases are discussed: ""This criterion in 
essence classifies as administrative and non-judicial decisional functions which courts are not particularly equipped to decide 
while leaving to the courts that category of decision making with which it has traditionally dealt and is equipped to handle under 
the adversary type of judicial procedure.  Decisions that require the inquisitorial type of procedure, investigative in nature, and 
which must, to attain optimum utility, be based upon a mosaic of expert opinion, judgment, and decisions are and should be 
regarded as non-judicial and left primarily to the administrators.  They are far more able to come to grips with such problems 
than a court or jury in the detached and sterile atmosphere of the courtroom."" (p. 160) "
326,6," A like problem was solved in a similar manner in De Mond v. Liquor Control Commission, 129 Conn. 642, 30 A.2d 547, 549, 
where the court said: ""Upon these appeals the court hears and considers all pertinent matters for the purpose of reaching an 
intelligent conclusion as to the legal propriety of the action of the commissioners.  In this qualified sense, but in no other, is its 
hearing one de novo."" Another approach to a similar problem was made in American Beauty Homes Corp. v. Louisville, etc., Ky., 
379 S.W.2d 450, where the court held that ""the statute was invalid with respect to the trial 'de novo' but still permitted an 
aggrieved party to appeal.  This also was the ruling in California Co. v. State Oil and Gas Board, 200 Miss. 824, 27 So.2d 542, 
28 So.2d 120, heretofore cited.  We think the 'de novo' provision of KRS 100.057 is clearly severable from the rest of this 
statute."" "
327,7," In United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, supra, the Court was confronted with a difficulty arising out of the language of ยง 7 of 
the Clayton Act. The Court recognized merit in the contention of the appellees that the merger there involved an assets 
acquisition and hence that ยง 7 had no application since the Federal Trade Commission had no jurisdiction over banks.  The 
Court said (374 U.S. at p. 337): ""Since the literal terms of ยง 7 thus do not dispose of our question, we must determine whether a 
congressional design to embrace bank mergers is revealed in the history of the statute."" The Court's final conclusion was based 
upon what it found to be a ""plain congressional purpose."""
327,8," During the debate in the House Congressman Moorehead, one of the members of the committee most actively in charge of the 
bill, cited and quoted from the Seaboard Air Line case, and also from McLean Trucking Co. v. U.S., 321 U.S. 67, 87, 88 L. Ed. 
544, 64 S. Ct. 370, as appropriate precedents for his point: ""In the banking industry the public interest is represented and 
protected by a regulating body.  In mergers in such a situation the custom is that the validity of a merger should be determined 
not exclusively by the competitive factors, but that the regulating body should also consider the public interest."" Cong. Rec. 
February 8, 1966, p. 2340. "
328,9," After Congressman Multer had given an illustration of how this language would apply in a case not involving a failing bank, the 
following colloquy occurred: ""Mr. Weltner.  This is a case of a failing bank, which has long been recognized by the court.  It has nothing to do with this 
legislation.  I am sure the gentleman from Wisconsin will agree with me, that we do not have to pass any bill to permit the 
approving agency to merge a failing bank in order to save it from insolvency.  I am certain that the gentlemen from New York, 
indeed, would say, as a well-educated lawyer, that the failing bank doctrine exists independently of any statutes which has been 
passed in the last 20 or 30 years.  I yield to the gentleman for the purpose of responding to the correctness of that proposition. Mr. Multer: The gentleman is correct as far as he goes, but I have gone beyond the failing bank theory.  There are many 
instances where we are not concerned with the failing bank, where there is an absolute and complete diminution of competition, 
yet under all the circumstances and all of the factors the courts should approve that merger just as the regulatory agencies may 
approve the merger."" Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 2346."
328,10," He said: "" . . . this bill, should convince the courts that the Congress does not intend that mergers in the banking field should 
be measured solely by the antitrust considerations which are applied in other industries."" (Cong. Rec. Feb. 9, 1966, p. 2541.) In 
short, something apart from the older antitrust considerations, (including the failing company rule) are imported here.  He also 
said (p. 2542): ""The courts will no longer be able to say - in the case of a merger which does not reach to the point of creating a 
monopoly - that proof that a merger will have demonstrable benefits or will be benign is irrelevant.  On the contrary, the question 
whether there are or are not demonstrable benefits - whether the merger is benign or malignant - will be the heart of the issue."" 
Again he said (p. 2542): ""The effect of the merger on the public interest and on the convenience and needs of the community to 
be served must be measured in specific and realistic terms in the light of the kinds of business involved, and the kinds of people 
being served.  The banking agencies and the courts must be guided by the realities of the industrial, commercial, and financial 
worlds.  They must look through theories and percentages and doctrines to the hard facts of life."" "
329,11," In that case the Secretary of Agriculture made an order reducing stockyards rates.  After those rates had gone into effect the 
Supreme Court set aside the order of the Secretary because of procedural defects and the cause was remanded to the district 
court for further proceedings.  The Court stated that it would not attempt to forecast what further proceedings the Secretary 
might see fit to take.  The district court which had entered a temporary restraining order enjoining the enforcement of the 
Secretary's order had required the excess charges collected by the stockyards over and above the amount prescribed by the 
Secretary to be deposited with the court pending final determination of the case.  The Secretary then reopened the original 
proceedings and pending these proceedings the district court granted the appellees' motion to distribute the fund mentioned 
among them.  This decision was based upon a ruling that the Secretary did not have authority to make an order prescribing rates 
and charges effective as of the date of his original order. "

374,12," In ruling on defendant's motion for dismissal or a directed verdict, following argument by counsel, the court said: ""I was of the opinion that Florida was not a part of the market; that it was to be limited to Southern California and Arizona. I 
was of the opinion and still am of the opinion that it would certainly be uneconomical to try to ship fresh fruit from Florida or 
from Texas to California for the purpose of being converted into orange juice. So I have to look first to what is the 
competition in this case, what are the competitive factors? ""Well, if we include Florida as part of the market, then of course Sunkist does not have a dominant place in this picture at 
all.  It is a very minor part of the conversion of fresh fruit into orange juice, if we consider Florida as a part of the market. ""Then I thought we were talking about product oranges, the monopoly of product oranges. But it seems to me that we now 
are talking about product oranges, but also about the juice squeezed from the product oranges. I don't know how you can 
say that there is a monopoly on product oranges without saying there is a monopoly on the juice that is squeezed from 
product oranges."" (Rep. Tr. 1378:1-20). ""So it seems to me that when we talk about competition, we are going to talk about competition not only of the fruit before it 
is squeezed, but the product after the squeezing, that is the orange juice. ""Well, if you consider it in that light, then there is lots of competition on the shelves of Southern California, because the 
testimony is that the Florida producers, the Florida producers of orange juice, that is, those who squeeze the oranges to 
make orange juice in Florida, can ship it to Los Angeles, pay the shipping charges, and undersell the California product. ""So from these two standpoints, that is talking about competition, what is competition -- competition is the competition in the 
open marketplace."" (Rep. Tr. 1379:9-22)."
374,13," We concluded in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Prod. Co., 9 Cir. 1960, 284 F.2d 1, that the relevant market 
area for oranges and by-products, including fruits and juices, was the California-Arizona area, although it does not appear that 
the parties in that case argued or the court considered the distinction between product oranges and orange products or any 
contention that the market was national. "

of product oranges in California than any one factor? ""A.  They have effect on the over-all United States.  Then those who set prices on the fruit in California look at what is going 
on all over the United States, and at that time the prices were set in California by the leading growers. Sunkist set it, using 
all those things to do it, I assume.  But the price of by-products in this state has ever since I have been in the business 
since 1934, been set by Sunkist.  At one time it was called California Fruit Growers Exchange, and Sunkist at this time.""

377,17," In Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co., supra, the plaintiff relied upon some of the acts of monopoly 
here alleged. We upheld the submission of the case to the jury and the instructions given by the trial court.  The Supreme Court 
granted certiorari limited to the issue of the immunity of interorganizational dealings among the three cooperatives from the 
conspiracy provisions of the antitrust law, and held that as a Capper-Volstead cooperative Sunkist was immune and that the 
case was erroneously submitted to the jury on the theory of a conspiracy under section 1 of the Act.  HN28[
] Having held 
""erroneous one theory of liability upon which the general verdict may have rested * * * it is unnecessary * * * to explore the

Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co., 370 U.S. at 20-30."
377,18," A stipulation of the parties defining ""association"" in the Sunkist system recites that the members are classified into three major 
groups: (1) cooperative associations (80.12% by number and 82.34% by volume), (2) corporate growers (4.97% by number and 
4.72% by volume), and (3) agency associations (14.91% by number and 12.94% by volume).  The stipulation reads in part: ""The 
Agency Association is normally a private corporation which owns and operates packing house facilities * * *.  Such Agency 
Associations do not qualify as, nor do they claim to be, cooperative associations under section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act.  * * 
* The Agency Association does not itself participate in either the gain or loss involved in marketing fruit through Sunkist beyond 
the recovery of its costs and fixed fee for packing.  Such Agency Association furnishes its facilities and services on an 
independent contract basis, wholly unrelated to the net returns from the sale of the product handled"". "
378,19," The court said further: ""* * * The owner or operator of a dairy is a dairyman, whether he personally works on his dairy or has the work done by 
employees.  So, too, the owner of a farm may be regarded as a farmer even though he devotes the major portion of his 
activities to other pursuits. * * *."" 167 F. Supp. at 49. "
380,1," In its footnote 18, the majority refers to a portion of a stipulation wherein the parties agreed that the agency associations 
furnished to Sunkist their ""facilities and services on an independent contract basis . . . ."" The stipulation does not say that the 
associations were independent contractors.  It recites that they were ""members"" of the Sunkist system.  If the association were 
truly separate and independent, then that determination should be made, in the first instance, by the District Court.  If they were 
not ""members"" of the Sunkist system, then, as I see it, the exemption of the Capper-Volstead Act is irrelevant to the issue of the 
propriety of Sunkist's dealings with them.  United States v. Borden Co., supra. "

392,4," These principles were stated in the Columbia Steel opinion as follows: In determining what constitutes unreasonable restraint, we do not think the dollar volume is in itself of compelling significance; 
we look rather to the percentage of business controlled, the strength of the remaining competition, whether the action springs 
from business requirements or purposes to monopolize, the probable development of the industry, consumer demands, and 
other characteristics of the market.  We do not undertake to prescribe any set of percentage figures by which to measure the 
reasonableness of a corporation's enlargement of its activities by the purchase of the assets of a competitor.  The relative effect 
of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed.  At page 527. "
393,5," The Court rejects the defendant's and intervenor's argument that in assessing the anti-competitive effects of the merger the 
relevant geographic market is the broad area served by Third National's correspondent banking system.  There is no significant 
legislative history to support the view that the 1966 Amendment was intended to change the relevant geographic market concept 
as developed in antitrust law. The Court is of the opinion under the facts of this case that the relevant geographic market is 
Davidson County.  This is ""where, within the area of competitive overlap, the effect of the merger on competition will be direct 
and immediate.""  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, supra, at p. 357. Also, on the clear preponderance of the evidence 
in this case the appropriate ""line of commerce"" by which to appraise the competitive effects of the merger is the cluster of 
products and services denoted by the term commercial banking. The Court does not agree that the omission of the words ""in any 
line of commerce"" from the 1966 Amendment is indicative of a congressional intent to reject ""commercial banking"" as a distinct 
line of commerce in appraising anticompetitive effects.  It cannot be presumed that such an important change in established 
antitrust law would be made by mere omission.  Again, there is really no significant legislative history to support the defendants' 
and intervenor's position on this point. "
394,6," The Trust Company had created and maintained what was for the most part a good trust department, an aspect of its 
operations which need not be discussed in detail herein.  Trust departments, as the evidence shows, are operated primarily as a 
service to bank customers and are not an important lever in obtaining commercial business.  While there is some direct 
competition for trust business in the market area between commercial banks having trust departments, such competition is 
minimal.  The greatest area of direct competition for trust business is not with other banks but with individuals, such as lawyers.  
The loss of a trust account to a competitor bank is of infrequent occurrence. "

404,5," The Fry prices to dealers and ""approved distributors"" are computed by deducting all discounts for which they are eligible from 
the list price. Volasco's prices are taken from its sales records.  They are not exactly comparable to Fry's dealer prices because 
almost all of Volasco's sales are such that if they had been made by Fry, the buyer would not be entitled to any quantity 
discount. Volasco made isolated sales outside the price ranges as listed here.  To use them as the limits of the price range 
would be to present a distorted picture of Volasco's sales activity. "

Northern Pacific could not, the Court said, use one resource it possessed (land) to coerce its own customers in another market

competitors into the shoe machinery field. ""First, the complex of obligations and rights accruing under United's leasing system in operation deter a shoe manufacturer from 
disposing of a United machine and acquiring a competitor's machine. He is deterred more than if he owned that same United 
machine, or if he held it on a short lease carrying simple rental provisions and a reasonable charge for cancellation before the 
end of the term.  The lessee is now held closely to United by the combined effect of the 10-year term, the requirement that if he 
has work available he must use the machine to full capacity, and by the return charge which can in practice, through the right of 
deduction fund, be reduced to insignificance if he keeps this and other United machines to the end of the periods for which he 
leased them."" 110 F. Supp. at 340. ""In estimating defendant's strength, this Court gives some weight to the 75 plus percentage of the shoe machinery market which 
United serves.  But the Court considers other factors as well.  In the relatively static shoe machinery market where there are no 
sudden changes in the style of machines or in the volume of demand, United has a network of long-term, complicated leases 
with over 90% of the shoe factories.  These leases assure closer and more frequent contacts between United and its customers 
than would exist if United were a seller and its customers were buyers.  Beyond this general quality, these leases are so drawn 
and so applied as to strengthen United's power to exclude competitors."" Id. at 343. ""But United's control does not rest solely on its original constitution, its ability, its research, or its economies of scale.  There are 
other barriers to competition, and these barriers were erected by United's own business policies.  Much of United's market power 
is traceable to the magnetic ties inherent in its system of leasing, and not selling, its more important machines. The lease-only 
system of distributing complicated machines has many ""partnership "" aspects, and it has exclusionary features such as the 10-
year term, the full capacity clause, the return charges, and the failure to segregate service charges from machine charges.  
Moreover, the leasing system has aided United in maintaining a pricing system which discriminates between machine types."" Id. 
at 344. ""Furthermore, the creation of a sales market together with the purging of the restrictive features of the leases will, in 
combination, gradually diminish the magnetic hold now exercised by what United properly describes as the partnership features 
of the leasing system.  As United's relationships with its customers grow feebler, competitors will have an enhanced opportunity 
to market their wares. . . . ""A further answer is that if the creation of a sales alternative to leasing is, as this Court believes, necessary to dissipate United's 
monopoly power, the Court should not withhold its decree because its effect is to allow competitors to copy United's designs."" Id.

such time as there was a quorum of Justices qualified to sit in the case.  320 U.S. 708 (1943). Congress thereafter amended 15 
U.S.C. ยง 29 by the Act of June 9, 1944, ch. 239, 58 Stat. 272, which provided that in such circumstances the Court should certify 
the case to the appropriate circuit court of appeals, in lieu of a decision by the Supreme Court, and the decision of the circuit 
court of appeals should be final and unreviewable.  Acting under the statute the Supreme Court certified the case to the Circuit 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and it was in what Mr. Justice Frankfurter concurring in United States v. United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York, 334 U.S. 258, 265, 92 L. Ed. 1351, 68 S. Ct. 1035 (1948) called ""an

creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after 
investigation by the Commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, . . . the Commission 
by order authorizes such issue . . . .  The Commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue . . . (a) is for some 
lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or 
consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its

corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such 
acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" "
497,4," Section 20a was originally ยง 437 (1) of H. R. 10453, 66th Cong., which was almost identical to earlier legislation passed by the 
House in 1910 and 1914.  See 58 Cong. Rec. 8317-8318 (1919).  The 1910 version led to a study which condemned as a 
""public evil"" intercorporate holdings of railroad stock. Report of the Railroad Securities Commission, H. R. Doc. No. 256, 62d 
Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1911).  These findings were part of the background against which Congress eventually passed ยง 20a,

499,7," In  Pan American World Airways v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, we held that Congress had entrusted the narrow questions 
there presented to the CAB; but the violations alleged were of the Sherman Act, which unlike the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 21, 
supra, n. 6, contains no provision imposing an affirmative duty upon the agency to enforce the Act's provisions.  The industry 
there was one ""regulated under a regime designed to change the prior competitive system,""  id., at 301, and the CAB could have 
retained power and granted antitrust immunity for the actions involved had they occurred after passage of ยง 411 of the Civil 
Aeronautics Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1003,  id., at 312. "
500,8," A change in the agreement providing that Greyhound should offer to purchase the stock held by the railroads before the 
issuance of the 500,000 shares would have developed the relevant facts, and made unnecessary postponement of the 
determination of either the control or competition issue."
500,9," If the dissident REA railroad stockholders exercised their right of first refusal to buy the 1,000,000 shares the other railroad 
stockholders might sell, their combined stockholdings would be increased to over 50% of the REA shares.  See Brief for the 
United States and ICC, p. 18, n. 9. "
505,1," The Commission found that REA had agreed ""to consider seriously and work toward a long-term agreement between applicant 
[REA] and Greyhound to consolidate operating functions and facilities, and to cooperate in all lawful, feasible and jointly 
advantageous ways to effect economies, improve service and increase public receptivity and patronage . . . ."" A ""Memorandum 
of Understanding"" between an official of each of the two companies contained some suggested methods for achieving these 
goals."
505,2," The ICC's order dealing with the legitimacy of this transaction said: "". . . applicant urgently needs the proceeds of $ 10,000,000 
in its program of acquiring and modernizing terminals and equipment in order to keep operating costs at a reasonable level; that 
it is handicapped in borrowing to finance capital improvements because of its unfavorable debt-equity ratio; that the proposed 
issue will improve its ratio as well as reduce to some extent the amount of future borrowing required; that the price of $ 20 per 
share is fair and reasonable; and that the expenses of the issue are estimated at $ 15,000 . . . ."" "
506,3," The ""public interest"" of concern to Congress was the problem of watered stock. See, e. g., statement of Congressman 
Rayburn: "". . . if we write into the law of the land a statute to the effect that before a railroad can issue new securities, before it 
can put them on the market, it must come before the properly constituted governmental agency, lay the full facts of its financial 
situation before that body, tell that body what it intends to do with the money derived from the sale of the issue of securities, and 
after it has received the approval of that regulating body and it goes out and puts those securities on the market, then the 
Interstate Commerce Commission by this law is empowered at any time to call it to account and have it tell to that regulating 
body that it expended the money, the proceeds of the sale of securities, for the purposes for which it had made the application."" 
58 Cong. Rec. 8376 (1919).  See also statement of Congressman Esch, id., at 8317-8318.  See generally MacVeagh, The 
Transportation Act of 1920, at 486-492 (1923)."
506,4," Section 20a (2) reads in its entirety: ""It shall be unlawful for any carrier to issue any share of capital stock or any bond or other 
evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the carrier (hereinafter in this section collectively termed 'securities') or to assume any 
obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise, in respect of the securities of any other person, 
natural or artificial, even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the 
extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after investigation by the Commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed 
issue and the proceeds thereof, or of the proposed assumption of obligation or liability in respect of the securities of any other 
person, natural or artificial, the Commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption.  The Commission shall make such 
order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible 
with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service 
to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary 
and appropriate for such purpose."""
506,5," Both sections were parts of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 480, 494. "
520,1," Thus, it is unnecessary to decide whether the failing company doctrine extends to the sale of an unprofitable subsidiary of a 
prosperous parent company.  It would seem that most of the justifications for the doctrine would be equally applicable to such a 
situation and that the doctrine if otherwise applicable should be applied, but see In the Matter of Farm Journal, Inc., 53 FTC 26 
(1956), affirmed by the Commission, 53 FTC 52 (1956), where the hearing examiner found that a publication sold by Curtis 
Publishing Company to a competitor had been a losing venture while Curtis was making money from other ventures, and 
concluded that the merger was not protected by International Shoe.  The examiner stressed the fact that Curtis could have 
""modernized"" the publication or could have found other purchasers. The fact that Reed's primary objective in acquiring American Iron was to obtain the fluid end expendable portion of the business 
has no relevancy to the legality of the merger or, for that matter, to the type of relief to be ordered. "
522,2," Partial divestiture has been ordered by both the courts and the Federal Trade Commission.  Decisions of the Commission are 
especially illustrative of the use of the doctrine since the FTC is required to order divestiture whenever it finds a violation of

during argument on defendants' motion for a directed verdict (TR. April 19, 1967): "" The Court: Now, I notice in Kiefer-Stewart v. Seagram and Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 S. Ct. 259, we have 
here the same company, the defendant Seagram and Sons.  It would appear to the Court as an inference only - just for the 
purpose of this discussion I will take this inference - that excellent counsel advised Seagram to tear out the veil of corporate 
ownership; nevertheless, keep your divisions just as 'independent' as they were before, keep them as competitive as they 
were before, but tear out the veil, and then we will have cured the defect found in our organizational setup, as pointed out 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in Stewart. "" Mr. Anthony: That is correct."" "

607,19," Because of the decision we reach we need not decide between conflicting views of whether it is necessary to a successful 
assertion of the defense of misuse that all elements of civil or criminal liability under the antitrust laws be shown.  The cases 
indicate no such standard of proof is required.  Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra, 314 U.S. at 490, 62 S. Ct. 402;

Note the conclusion of the Attorney General's Committee that ""from some abuses of patent policy [sufficient to justify non-
enforcement of the patent] may flow consequences not drastic enough to meet antitrust prerequisites of effect on competition.  In 
addition, many patent abuses are more effectively curbed by simply denying relief as a matter of patent policy,"" (Report, at 254.) But compare the view of Kennedy, Patent and Antitrust Policy; the Search for a Unitary Theory, 35 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 512 
(1966), at 560: ""Faulty reasoning * * * underlies the widely held view that extra patent restraints of no competitive significance 
justify the denial of injunctive relief.  * * * Attempts at metaphysical distinctions between patent policy and antitrust policy 
violations serve no constructive purpose * * * [Defendants asserting misuse] defenses should be held to substantive standards of 
violation evolved under the Sherman, Clayton or Federal Trade Commission Acts."" Certainly a case of misuse not sufficient to constitute a violation of the antitrust laws requires careful synthesis of the policies 
represented by the patent and the antitrust laws. Kennedy, supra. Baxter, Legal Restrictions in Exploitation of the Patent 
Monopoly: An Economic Analysis, 76 Yale L.J. 267 (1966)."
607,20," A contractual duty (even if not enforced) may be sufficient to constitute misuse. See Berlenbach v. Anderson & Thompson Ski

volatiles - and, specifically, the freeing of them when the material is solidified - renders an organosol normally unsuitable for 
casting in a closed mold. "
632,4," HN1[
] ""A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter 
as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said 
subject matter pertains."" "
633,5," Defendant puts heavy reliance upon its expert, urging that the force, learning, and ""credibility"" of his testimony should weigh 
heavily against plaintiff's efforts to defeat the patent in suit.  Unfortunately for defendant, while its expert did not appear to depart 
from literal ""truth"" about concrete matters of fact, his ostensibly learned ""opinions"" were not impressive.  He found himself in 
general incapable of learning anything useful from patents and other references invoked against Molitor.  On the other hand, 
where Molitor's patent is obscure or silent, he was able to fill the gaps or dispel the clouds by easy reference to ""common sense"" 
or general knowledge.  The example at this point in the text is by no means the most vivid, as subsequent discussion will show.  
It is notable, nevertheless, that a highly trained natural scientist should have found it a mark of ""invention"" to perceive that a 
technique usable for flowable materials which harden when heat is withdrawn could be transposed to liquids which harden when 
heat is added. While plaintiff's expert was on the whole more helpful, he exhibited similar qualities of partisanship.  Supporting the view that 
Delacoste anticipated Molitor, he professed a frequent inability to find meaning in the latter while the former struck him as 
pellucid in all vital respects."
633,6," The fact that latex had been rotationally cast before Molitor is, like so much else, undisputed.  In the court's view, there is no 
need to tarry, therefore, over one reference plaintiff offered and defendant opposed for lack of proper notice.  The simplest 
course in the circumstances is readily justified, and the court follows it.  Plaintiff's Exhibit 381, the Kay Patent, is excluded. The evidence showed that rotational casting is a more elaborate and delicate process for latex than it is for plastisols because 
(1) water must be removed from the latex in casting and (2) full curing must be accomplished as a later, separate step.  The 
utility of this point to defendant is at best debatable.  It would seem to show that the ancient casting technique was more readily 
and simply adaptable to plastisols than to an earlier plastic that solidifies with heat. "
634,7," During the early stages of his sojourn through the Patent Office - from June 27, 1950, to February 24, 1953, during which 
period his original claims were all stricken and entirely rewritten - Molitor asserted he ""was the first to apply the deaerating step 
to vinyl chlorides used in the molding of hollow articles."" This assertion survives vestigially in Molitor's specifications, when he 
says (col. 3, lines 24-26): ""The final mixing of the casting batch under vacuum is an important and essential step in the process."" 
It is now conceded, however, under the compulsion of overwhelming evidence, that the ""essential"" step of deaeration was 
common knowledge well before Molitor among those working with plastisols. "
635,8," It makes no difference for the question of obviousness treated here that the bulletin failed by a narrow margin to precede 
Molitor's application by more than a year, and thus presented no bar under 35 U.S.C. ยง 102(b).  It should be observed in this 
connection, however, that plaintiff has urged the assignment to Molitor of some filing date later than June 27, 1950, the 
contention being that the initial application was not ""effective"" because of certain omissions and later amendments.  There is no 
need, all things considered, to dwell upon this argument by plaintiff beyond recording that the court has rejected it. "
636,9," Defendant's expert made some quibbling efforts (Tr. 4131 et seq.) to show teachings in Molitor assertedly absent from (or 
inferior in) the American Anode bulletin.  The net of his suggestions is to reenforce plaintiff's thesis that the bulletin amply 
covered the same thing in every pertinent respect."
636,10," A ""Mickey Mouse"" was a central character in the trial and is pictured on Molitor's patent with the much extolled and discussed 
""uniform wall."" Samples of this figure made in defendant's plant by Molitor's process were also in evidence.  They had distinctly 
non-uniform walls.  Molitor's quaint explanation was that a uniform wall was not really wanted for the actual toy."
636,11," Pressed repeatedly to specify what Molitor taught that was new, defendant's expert came finally to say that Molitor's 
achievement lay in his proclaiming that rotational casting of plastisols was ""possible."" "
637,12," Trial Brief of Defendant, p. 15. "
638,13," Compare the converse argument of plaintiff, considered and dismissed later on, that there is no infringement because plaintiff 
uses a single heating step while Molitor must be read to teach two. "
639,14," The parenthetical word, here as elsewhere in the quoted portions of the Italian patent, represents an alternative translation of 
the original Italian - in this instance, the word ""caldo."" It is conceivable that daring lawyers or judges, recalling encounters with 
Italian sinks or Italian colleagues or Italian-English dictionaries, might deem it knowable without more that the word ""caldo"" may 
mean either ""hot"" or ""warm"" depending upon the context.  The defendant, however, announced early in the trial a disposition to 
mount intensive attacks upon this word in the Italian patent. Plaintiff produced a distinguished expert in the Italian language to 
cope with this problem.  The upshot of this effort is a finding that the Italian word ""caldo"" may mean either ""hot"" or ""warm"" 
depending upon the context. "
640,15," The record shows that when Delacoste obtained his patent, it was common, especially in Europe (including England), to use 
the word ""gel"" ambiguously, tending to bracket under it the stages now separately identified as gelation and fusion. Defendant's 
expert tardily conceded this.  But defendant's views on the subject lack substance even apart from this pertinent item of 
linguistics. "
642,16," A doctrine which appears, incidentally, to have had less standing in the same Circuit both before and since the decision in 
Sun's favor. See Allied Wheel Products v. Rude, 206 F.2d 752, 759-760 (6th Cir. 1953); Monroe Auto Equipment Co. v. 
Heckethorn Mfg. & Sup. Co., 332 F.2d 406, 413 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 888, 85 S. Ct. 160, 13 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1964)."
642,17," Testimony for the defense was that Molitor was to make such reports weekly at first, later monthly.  But the gaps are much 
larger than weeks or months. A defense witness suggested the explanation that Molitor was engrossed in his work, impatient 
over writing things down.  Yet one of the longest of the few documents ascribed to him was shown to have been copied to a 
large extent from publicly available writings distributed by Goodrich."
642,18," For reflections of the importance asscribed to this point and the ""progress reports"" by the Sixth Circuit, see 274 F.2d at 231, 
233, 234. It is unnecessary for our purposes to pinpoint exactly the extent to which the subject was deemed critical by that Court. "
643,," It is sufficient that it was obviously considered to be material and was offered by Sun, both there and here, to be so considered.  
See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 247, 64 S. Ct. 997, 88 L. Ed. 1250 (1944). "
644,19," Molitor was shown in other respects to have a penchant for misstatements that cannot be deemed inadvertent.  He swore, for 
example, that a machine allegedly used in his 1948 experiments had not been known to him at the time as a ""Kaysam machine"" 
(a matter of potential consequence in the case).  Confronted with a prior contradiction of this in writing, he retracted it.  He swore 
falsely in the Patent Office to having experience working with plastisols prior to his employment by defendant.  Examples could 
be multiplied, but it is sufficient to note that this alleged inventor was a singularly unimpressive witness whose credibility was not 
enhanced when he protested that he was ""confused,"" apologized for ""[appearing] so stupid,"" professed modesty about his ability 
to express himself when his explanations sounded particularly lame, and explained that the supposedly vital ""progress reports"" 
did not mean what they appeared simply to say."
644,20," The evidence showed that before this nocturnal drama Molitor had little day-to-day contact with the company president, 
reporting normally to people lower in the hierarchy."
644,21," This is not the only specific instance of false testimony by Smith.  In an affidavit filed in this court to support a motion resisting 
in personam jurisdiction over defendant, he stated that Sun's only place of business was in Barberton, Ohio.  The statement is 
now conceded to have been false.  But it required an appeal from an order of dismissal to arrive at that concession.  Another 
Smith affidavit denied the existence of a requirements contract with Goodrich.  It has since been established that such a 
contract, negotiated by Smith, did in fact exist.  The same affidavit denied, falsely, that defendant had ever licensed any 
company other than McNeil to make machines for Molitor's process - a denial that concealed a license with another company on "
645,," which plaintiff predicates claimed antitrust violations.  Other instances, cited by plaintiff, need not be recounted. It is recorded, 
however, that Smith's manner, his repeated mistakes and bland ""correction"" of them when they became apparent, and his 
tendency toward argumentative oratory - in addition to the substance of his inaccuracies - all comprised a chapter of the 
evidence which has proved hurtful to defendant's case. "
647,22," It may be recalled that the court much earlier rejected defendant's claim to the supposedly unique, novel, and nonobvious idea 
of heating both to gel and fuse at the single (high) fusion temperature."
647,23," Plaintiff has some other ""estoppel"" arguments on this subject.  They are without merit. "
648,24," This summary should include, however, the court's contingent reservation on the question of allegedly vague and insufficient 
teachings, which would seemingly warrant further consideration if the conclusion as to obviousness is later found erroneous. "
654,1," It was noted in the congressional debates that this section referred to three so-called ""post Philadelphia cases - in Nashville, 
San Francisco and St. Louis - where mergers were consummated after that Philadelphia decision."" This is the San Francisco 
case there referred to.  The Philadelphia case referred to is United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 10 L. Ed. 2d 
915, 83 S. Ct. 1715. In that connection reference was also made to United States v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Lexington et 
al., 376 U.S. 665, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1, 84 S. Ct. 1033."
654,2," With this view we disagree.  As the Supreme Court indicated in United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, supra, 386 
U.S. at 369, at best, all that one can say is that the ""failing company doctrine"" is ""related, though perhaps remotely"", to the 
convenience and needs of the community to be served.  In our view it would be absurd to find that new standards so carefully 
framed from the 1966 Bank Merger Act were no more than the inclusion of a wholly unnecessary reference to the failing 
company doctrine. "
655,," There is not the slightest indication in the language of the Act, or its legislative history, to support the Government's effort to thus 
cancel or dissipate the declared purpose of the Act.  During the debate on the bill, the question of the situation of the failing bank 
was mentioned, and in a colloquy between Congressman Weltner, who opposed the bill, and Congressman Multer, who 
supported it, it was made plain that the language referred to was not limited to the failing bank situation.  After Congressman 
Multer had given an illustration of how this language would apply in a case not involving a failing bank, the following colloquy 
occurred: Mr. Weltner: This is a case of a failing bank, which has long been recognized by the court.  It has nothing to do with this 
legislation.  I am sure the gentleman from Wisconsin will agree with me, that we do not have to pass any bill to permit the 
approving agency to merge a failing bank in order to save it from insolvency. I am certain that the gentleman from New 
York, indeed, would say, as a well-educated lawyer, that the failing bank doctrine exists independently of any statutes 
which has been passed in the last 20 or 30 years.  I yield to the gentleman for the purpose of responding to the correctness 
of that proposition. Mr. Multer: The gentleman is correct as far as he goes, but I have gone beyond the failing bank theory.  There are many 
instances where we are not concerned with the failing bank, where there is an absolute and complete diminution of 
competition, yet under all the circumstances and all of the factors the courts should approve that merger just as the 
regulatory agencies may approve the merger."" Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 2346. The careful and precise description of this portion of the bill, made by Senator Robertson to the Senate as the latter body 
prepared to accept the House version, would clearly negative any suggestion that it was limited to the failing company situation.  
He said: "" . . . this bill, should convince the courts that the Congress does not intend that mergers in the banking field should be 
measured solely by the antitrust considerations which are applied in other industries."" (Cong. Rec. Feb. 9, 1966, p. 2541.) In 
short, something apart from the older antitrust considerations, (including the failing company rule) are imported here.  He also 
said (p. 2542): ""The courts will no longer be able to say - in the case of a merger which does not reach to the point of creating a 
monopoly - that proof that a merger will have demonstrable benefits or will be benign is irrelevant.  On the contrary, the question 
whether there are or are not demonstrable benefits - whether the merger is benign or malignant - will be the heart of the issue."" 
Again he said (p. 2542): ""The effect of the merger on the public interest and on the convenience and needs of the community to 
be served must be measured in specific and realistic terms in the light of the kinds of business involved and the kinds of people 
being served.  The banking agencies and the courts must be guided by the realities of the industrial, commercial, and financial 
worlds.  They must look through theories and percentages and doctrines to the hard facts of life."" A final answer to the Government's ""failing company"" theory is found in the House Report's indication as to the limited extent of 
the use of financial resources of the affected banks.  That report states (U.S. Code, Cong. and Administrative News, 89th Cong. 
2d Session, p. 337): ""However, only the convenience and needs of the community to be served can be weighed against 
anticompetitive effects, with financial and managerial resources being considered only as they throw light on the capacity of the 
existing and proposed institutions to serve the community."" "
656,3," Representative Ashley, one of the members principally in charge of the bill in the House, stated (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 
2339): ""The bill would require the court to use the new standards of the bill in all . . . 'post Philadelphia' cases now pending in 
court. . . . The courts have repeatedly held that under the antitrust laws the social or economic benefits of a given merger cannot 
even be considered."" The Congressman then quoted from the statement to that effect in the Philadelphia case: ""It is a primary 
purpose of the bill to assure that the courts will never again dismiss as irrelevant the question of the needs of a community . . . 
[The] merger must be shown to be sufficiently beneficial in meeting the needs of the community to be served that, on balance, it 
may properly be regarded as in the public interest."" During the same discussion Rep. Stanton, a member of the Committee in charge of the bill, stated (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 
2343): It was the expressed purpose and intent of Congress when it passed the Bank Merger Act in 1960 to make certain that 
control of bank mergers should be in the hands of the appropriate banking supervisory agencies, and that while the 
competitive effects of a proposed merger should be considered, they were not to be given a predominant position.  These 
standards were repudiated by the Supreme Court in the Philadelphia National Bank and the Lexington Bank cases in which 
the Court decided that the Justice Department had the final say in bank mergers. Contrary to the intent of Congress, the 
bank regulatory authorities were relegated to advisory roles. These provisions . . . reinstate a measure of antitrust consideration which was lacking in the Senate bill, and they provide a 
banking standard that may allow economic assistance to a community even though a merger tends to lessen competition in 
that community.  It is this statutory balance that was intended in 1960. . . . The . . . bill . . . directs the courts to apply the banking standards as well as the competitive standards in any judicial 
proceeding attacking an approved merger transaction . . . it . . . gives these standards equal weight as between economic 
and competitive circumstances and it assures this equilibrium throughout the entire review procedure. "
657,4," In an effort to find some legislative history to bolster its position that this Act made no changes in the law, the Government has 
inserted in its brief some quotations from the remarks of individual congressmen during floor debate.  Taken out of context, as 
they are, they prove nothing.  It is true that the wording of ยง 18(c)(5) emphasized and restated the requirement that the 
Comptroller, and the reviewing courts, take into consideration the antitrust laws.  This was noted in debate, but it was also noted 
that this Act definitely and positively added a new standard.  As stated in the House Report of Supplemental views of 
Congressman Ottinger, who helped draft the bill: ""It also assures that banking services available to meet the convenience and 
needs of a community are considered in all cases and will prevail where they clearly outweigh nonmonopolistic anticompetitive 
effects of a merger."" Counsel's quotations from the debate ignore the rule stated in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 
U.S. 443, 474-475, 65 L. Ed. 349, 41 S. Ct. 172, as follows: By repeated decisions of this court it has come to be well established that the debates in Congress expressive of the views 
and motives of individual members are not a safe guide, and hence may not be resorted to, in ascertaining the meaning 
and purpose of the law-making body. . . . But reports of committees of House or Senate stand upon a more solid footing, 
and may be regarded as an exposition of the legislative intent in a case where otherwise the meaning of a statute is 
obscure. . . . And this has been extended to include explanatory statements in the nature of a supplemental report made by 
the committee member in charge of a bill in course of passage. Counsel have largely confined their quotations to those from Congressmen Weltner and Todd, who opposed the bill, and from 
Congressman Patman, who bitterly fought the legislation, and finally, through a face-saving compromise, introduced the bill, 
while stating that if he alone were writing the bill, he ""would be against it as a matter of principle."" (Cong. Rec. Feb. 8, 1966, p. 
2357.) Counsel's choice of makers of remarks is not very persuasive. "
658,5," It is this officer who must act if the acquiring, assuming or resulting bank is to be a national bank. Where a state bank is to be 
the resulting one, the decision is to be made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In other cases, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is to make the decision."
658,6," In that connection we said: It will be noticed that the standards of ยง 5 are to be applied in granting or refusing leave to merge in the future.  The 
contemplated action ""looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule, to be applied thereafter to * 
* * some part of those subject to its power,"" as fully as the establishment of railroad rates in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line 
Co., 211 U.S. 210, 226, 53 L. Ed. 150, 29 S. Ct. 67. It involves a determination and establishment of a public policy. See Finfrock, ""Trial de Novo - Panacea?"" in Baylor Law Review, 135, where the Texas cases are discussed: ""This criterion 
in essence classifies as administrative and non-judicial decisional functions which courts are not particularly equipped to 
decide while leaving to the courts that category of decision making with which it has traditionally dealt and is equipped to 
handle under the adversary type of judicial procedure.  Decisions that require the inquisitorial type of procedure, 
investigative in nature, and which must, to attain optimum utility, be based upon a mosaic of expert opinion, judgment, and "
659,," decisions are and should be regarded as non-judicial and left primarily to the administrators.  They are far more able to 
come to grips with such problems than a court or jury in the detached and sterile atmosphere of the court room."" (p. 160).

660,7," Note the usefulness of findings based on assumptions made by the district court in United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,

660,8," The head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in a letter to the Comptroller on November 10, 1966, took the 
position that ""There is thus no provision for an administrative hearing by your office nor are there any standards prescribed for 
such a hearing"", and since the court must determine de novo the legality of the merger, the Department of Justice saw no need 
for plaintiff to appear at the Comptroller's hearing.  (BK-PPP) "
661,9," Even though this court can no longer order a divestiture of Crocker's prior merger of these banks, it does not follow that this 
court may not consider these prior mergers in its evaluation of the expansion trend of Crocker and any bearing they may have 
on the question of whether but for the instant merger Crocker would have branched de novo into the banking market of Citizens. "

664,11," On the characteristics of California's economy, Professor Weston testified: Q.  Are there any factors regarding the characteristics of particular areas of California's economy that you deem significant? A.  Yes.  Again, it is well known that California is characterized by the two highly urbanized areas, the Bay Area and the 
L.A. area.  Then in between, the North Coast area, lumber, fishing, the mountain area, the agricultural areas, the desert 
areas. So that you have a great diversity in regional economic characteristics in California. Q.  And what significance did that have with regard to the instant merger? A. This has a significance that a branching system is able to help mobilize the financial resources of the State more 
effectively.  It can gather deposits in areas that generate deposits and use them in loans in areas that are growing rapidly, 
where loans are needed. And this is particularly significant for a capital deficit area, such as California, that imports capital, because it enables the 
branch system to more effectively utilize the financial resources of the State. Q.  In considering - Judge Zirpoli: Would this be a factor which indicates that there is such a thing as a statewide market? The Witness: No.  It indicates that where you have branching in an area with diverse economic characteristics, that you get 
benefits basically of diversification both on the deposit side and on the lending side. (Tr. 1486-1487) Judge Zirpoli: But you have just indicated that there is a possibility of an intake at one section of the State and an outgo at 
another section. The Witness: That is true. Judge Zirpoli: Yes.  Doesn't this give it a statewide characteristic? The Witness: Insofar as you have statewide branching, the extent to which this activity of gathering by commercial banks 
and lending out in another place is restricted by law to a state area. But insurance companies, for example, can gather in the diverse areas of California and take the money out of California.  
Legally they do. Since California is a capital deficit area, insurance companies tend to do the opposite.  They gather funds in other parts of 
the country and lend them out in California. The fact that this commercial banking activity is co-terminus with the political boundaries of the State of California is not 
determined on economic grounds; it is determined on the grounds that statewide branching is the limit of the extent to 
which this branching can take place. Mr. Zirpoli: All right. The Witness: One other aspect of this is that again on the lending side the larger California banks in the national bank 
division do send their men out to talk to customers in other parts of the country, but again as a practical matter, to try to "
665,," handle their California business, although if - again, if California were not a capital deficit area these national banking 
division people might well be trying to make loans to firms in New York just as the New York banks and Chicago banks 
make loans in California. So that from an economic standpoint there is not a statewide commercial banking activity. (Tr. 1488-1489)"
665,12," From our experience in this and other cases involving regulatory agencies, we agree with the observation of District Judge 
McMahan in United States v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 240 F. Supp. 867, 881 (S.D.N.Y. 1965), that: We think that if ever there were a field requiring administrative expertise to unravel the tangled threads of the evidence and 
weave them into a meaningful fabric, this is it.  This case involves a multitude of technical, intricate and complex problems 
in the field of money and banking, a subject within the special competence of the Board and outside the conventional 
experience of judges. We further agree with the suggestion of Mr. Justice Harlan (dissenting) in United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 
651, 664, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12, 84 S. Ct. 1044 (1964), that this ""duplicative . . . anachronistic system of dual regulation should be re-
examined."""
665,13," Check writing, as the most convenient way of paying debts, and the department-store-of-finance characteristics of local banks, 
are the basic items of convenience that make commercial banking an appropriate line of commerce in the local market.  The 
growth of the demand deposit activity of commercial banks has lagged behind the growth of the economy as a whole.  During 
the postwar years the economy, as measured by gross national product, has grown at a rate three or four times the growth rate 
of demand deposits (Weston, Tr. 1469-1470), and according to some experts, the activities of noncommercial bank financial 
intermediaries, have served as effective economic substitutes for the use of demand deposits (Weston, Tr. 1471). Checking 
accounts are sort of a loss leader.  In fact, the total operating income of California commercial banks from demand deposit 
service charges is less than 1/20th of 1% of their total operating revenue (Weston, Tr. 1474). As a matter of practical experience, time deposits in a savings and loan association of commercial bank are the equivalent of 
demand deposits in that both are paid on demand (Dirlam, Tr. 557-558).  The only practical difference between a demand 
deposit in a commercial bank and a time deposit in commercial banks and savings and loan associations relates to the 
procedure by which those deposits are withdrawn.  In the case of a demand deposit in a commercial bank, the procedure "
666,," consists in the use of checks, whereas with a savings and loan or time deposit, the intervening procedure consists in presenting 
the necessary documents at the place of deposit (Dirlam, Tr. 558-559). If there is an advantage to commercial banks by reason of their ability to offer the unique function or service of checking 
accounts, the advantage is their ability to use that function as a sort of loss leader to get the customer into the bank for the 
purpose of selling him some other service, for which there is fierce competition with other financial institutions (Weston, Tr. 
1597).  While they are the only institutions which have the benefit of that loss leader, there was no evidence that this advantage 
would enable a commercial bank in one section of the state to be able to successfully compete with other financial institutions 
located in a distant community for the business of a customer located there."
666,14," In making this observation we are not unmindful of the decision in Manufacturers Hanover, supra, that ""commercial banking"" is 
an appropriate line of commerce, even though a geographic market as extensive as the entire nation may be involved.  
However, we feel that the expanded ""section of the country"" considerations we urge herein are essential to a true evaluation of a 
bank merger in a section of the country of the magnitude of the whole of California, and it is up to us to clarify any confusion 
Government's counsel feel will arise in the application of these considerations."
666,15," The significance of the omission of this phrase so essential to ยง 7 of the Clayton Act was not decided by the Supreme Court of 
the United States in United States v. First City Nat. Bank of Houston, supra. In footnote 1 at page 369, the Court said:"
666,12," U.S.C. ยง 1828(c)(5)(B) provides, as we have seen, that a merger shall not be approved ""whose effect in any section of 
the country may be substantially to lessen competition."" It is pointed out that that standard omits the phrase ""in any line of 
commerce"" which is present in ยง 7 of the Clayton Act.  It is argued that Congress meant that commercial banking is no 
longer to be considered as an area of effective competition and that the Act establishes in banking ""a market test 
measurable only by larger commercial realities "". We do not reach this question and we intimate no opinion on it nor any views on the merits of these mergers or on the 
justifications that are urged in their support.  All questions except the procedural ones treated in the opinion are reserved. This court, however, if it is to provide a vehicle for finality on all the questions presented by the instant merger, must resolve this 
question, even though for alternative reasons hereinafter stated, such resolution of the question might prove not to have been 
necessary."

helping to draft this legislation."" (Cong. Rec., Feb. 8, 1966, p. 2355.) "
669,19," For an expression of these views, see: The 1966 Amendment to the Bank Merger Act, Economic Perspective and Legal 
Analysis, 20 Vand.L.Rev. 200 (1966), and Phillips, Competition, Confusion and Commercial Banking, 19 J. Finance 32 (1964).  
The writer in the Vanderbilt Law Review article, at pages 201-203, noted in part: While generally the occasional failure of business concerns is not considered undesirable in light of the overall benefits to 
be derived from unrestricted competition, the central role of banking in the national economy has fostered widespread 
recognition that bank solvency and liquidity are sufficiently important to require a check on competitive forces.  Therefore, 
public regulation of commercial banking reflects an attempt to obtain the benefits of competition while guarding against 
widespread bank failure as a method of eliminating the less efficient competitors from the market structure. As a result the 
regulatory scheme is characterized by the somewhat conflicting objectives of efficiency through competition and stability 
through regulation. The most fundamental regulation imposed upon the market structure of commercial banking is limitation of entry.  A charter 
for a new national bank will not be granted unless the capital structure, earnings prospects and management capabilities of 
the prospective bank give adequate assurance that entry will not produce excessive competition and possible failure. 
Similarly, inability to meet these standards may cause the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), in effect, to 
prevent entry by denying an application for deposit insurance.  The FDIC, Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and the 
Comptroller of the Currency may refuse permission to open new branches on the same grounds.  Furthermore, national 
banks are apparently subject to state law with regard to branching limitations. Banks are also subject to numerous provisions designed to insure sound banking practices.  For example, banks belonging 
to the Federal Reserve System (member banks) and insured non-member banks are precluded from paying interest on 
demand deposits. This discourages competitive efforts to attract demand deposits and the correlative tendency to make 
speculative loans and investments to cover the interest costs.  Federal law also requires the FRB and FDIC to specify 
maximum rates of interest that insured banks may pay on savings and time deposits. A number of states also limit the rate 
of interest payable, and, where the state rate is below the federal maximum, federal law requires that national banks not 
exceed the state maximum rate. Regulation of competition also extends to the market for bank loans.  The area within which competitive forces operate is 
circumscribed as to maximum rates by state usury laws, and is affected as to the minimum charge by FRB manipulation of 
the rediscount rate, open-market operations and modification of reserve requirements. While the FRB operations are not 
regulatory in the strict sense, they affect the supply of money and credit in the economy and thereby influence the ""prime"" 
or minimum bank interest rate.  In the range between the practical minimum set by Federal Reserve policy and the 
maximum allowed under state usury laws, competitive forces are free to operate.  Moreover, national banks are precluded 
from lending more than an amount equal to ten per cent of their paid-in capital and unimpaired surplus to any one obligor, 
and state banks are generally subject to similar limitations.  National and state member banks are also prohibited from 
investing in common stocks, and from holding for their own account investment securities of a single obligor in excess of 
ten per cent of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus.  Such investment prohibitions, while helping to insure continued 
stability, have the added effect of limiting the control which banks might otherwise exert over industry in general.  In 
addition, the broad visitorial powers of federal bank examiners provide the agencies with a flow of information based on 
frequent and intensive examinations.  The banks must furnish detailed periodic reports of their operations, and the agencies 
have the power to order examinations whenever they are deemed necessary. Numerous sanctions are provided, but the 
vast majority of banks go to great lengths to avoid grounds for criticism. The foregoing restrictions on private initiative have 
caused economists to question the extent to which antitrust policy can foster a type of competition conducive to improved 
bank performance. "
671,20," The accuracy of the above tabulation is reflected in table 14 of the Report of the Governor's Banking Study Committee on the 
Future of Banking in California (January 26, 1965), which is based on data for 1951 as of March 31; for 1954 and 1960 as of 
September 30; and 1957 and 1962 as of October 31.  The table clearly demonstrates the extent to which competition from other 
financial institutions has materially affected a very substantial element within the banks' line of commerce between 1951 and 
1962: [SEE TABLE IN ORIGINAL] "
673,21," The recent case of United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 16 L. Ed. 2d 555, 86 S. Ct. 1478 (1966), definitely 
established that concentration is a function of the market.  That case involved the merger of two competing grocery chains in the 
Los Angeles area.  Mr. Justice Black's majority opinion makes clear that section 7 deals with the number of separate competitors 
and market concentration. In disregarding a finding of the district court that there had been no increase in concentration, Mr. 
Justice Black noted that there had been a decline of more than 1700 separate competitors in the market and, speaking for the 
majority, stated: It is thus apparent that the District Court, in finding No. 80, used the term ""concentration"" in some sense other than a total 
decrease in the number of separate competitors which is the crucial point here.  (384 U.S. at 273 n. 3.) He goes on to state: Thus, where concentration is gaining momentum in a market, we must be alert to carry out Congress' intent to protect 
competition against ever increasing concentration through mergers. (384 U.S. at 277.) In the instant case there has been at least a 35% increase in the number of separate competitors in every local banking market 
which plaintiff contends are relevant for judging the effects of the instant merger (BK-M; BK-N; BK-P; BK-Q; BK-OO; BK-PP).  
During the period 1954-1964, 706 new entries added as many ""separate competitors"" in various communities throughout 
California (BK-H; BK-I; BK-J).  In the short period since the Crocker-Citizens merger, 69 new banks have been established in 
various sections of California, 19 of them in Los Angeles County (G-360).  Interestingly enough, even if the state as a whole is 
taken as a market, we find that in terms of independent competitors, there has been a substantial increase in the number of 
competing banks since 1945 because, as Professor Dirlam had to admit, the Government overlooked the fact that its 208 
""banks"" in 1945 included all the Transamerica banks, as well as other affiliated banks which were not independent competitors 
(Dirlam, Tr. 729-733). "
674,22," On December 31, 1964, there were six state chartered foreign banks having 22 banking offices and agencies of seven foreign 
banks doing business in California.  Two others had permits and stated they would open in 1965. "
675,23," In determining how many banks were controlled by Transamerica, plaintiff's expert voiced the opinion that a 20% interest 
would be significant (Tr. 730).  In 1949, Transamerica owned at least 20% of the outstanding stock in some 27 California banks, 
including Bank of America and Citizens. In reaching his opinion as to the alleged reduction in the number of banks in California, Dirlam was of the belief that the total 
number of banks in the state dropped from 171 in 1954 to 129 in 1962, for an overall reduction of 42 (Dirlam, Tr. 735, lines 9-12; 
G-25).  In reaching that conclusion, Dirlam overlooked the fact that a number of the banks in existence prior to 1962 were 
controlled by Firstamerica (Dirlam, Tr. 735, line 9 - Tr. 736, line 5).  Under this hypothesis, however, the banks controlled by it 
could not be regarded as independent competing units.  They were not competing against each other (Dirlam, Tr. 736, lines 6-9). It was during the period 1954-1962 that the ""old"" First Western purchased 23 banks from Transamerica (G-30, nn. 2, 3).  It was 
also during that period that The California Bank and the ""old"" First Western acquired 33 other banks (for a total of 56) to form the 
present United California Bank in February 1961, with the approval of the Department of Justice (G-26, pp. 6-7). How many other banks in existence in 1945 and which merged prior to the end of 1964 were similarly controlled by common 
shareholders cannot be ascertained from the evidence.  Plaintiff's witness had no way of knowing (Dirlam, Tr. 731, 732). One group of banks under common ownership which plaintiff treated as four separate banks were the Work banks in Salinas, 
Monterey, Carmel and Pacific Grove.  All four had been controlled by the Work family prior to Crocker-Anglo's acquisition of the 
Salinas bank in 1956 and of the other three in 1959 (G-26, p. 2; G-337, p. 51, lines 22-24; p. 52, lines 13-18; p. 54, lines 4-6). Plaintiff even counted the Bank of San Rafael and First National Bank in San Rafael as separate banks, although they had 
identical shareholders, identical officers, shared the same building and published statements in the same annual report (G-26, p. 
2; G-337, p. 94, line 20 - p. 95, line 6).  Moreover the Bank of San Rafael was a savings bank without demand deposits, and by 
Dirlam's definition ""savings banks"" were outside the line of commerce (G-13; Dirlam, Tr. 493, 556, 558)."
675,24," The testimony of Professor Joel B. Dirlam as it related to banking in California was too speculative and hypothetical to carry 
much weight with this court.  He had only recently been concerned with the field of banking, had never been to Los Angeles, had 
never been to San Francisco prior to the trial, knew nothing about the various other California communities other than what was 
disclosed on maps, had made ""no particular study of California"", and did not investigate banking in California.  Contrasted to his 
testimony is that of Professor J. Fred Weston of the Graduate School of Business Administration of the University of California, 
Los Angeles, who knows California well and had had many years' experience in the problems of the financial industry in 
California, and Associate Professor Oscar Goodman of the Graduate School of Business at Northwestern University, who was 
one of the experts relied upon by the Government in the Philadelphia and Lexington cases, who had resided and taught for a 
period in California and who had made a special, extensive and ""on the ground"" study of the banking situation in California for 
the purposes of the trial of this case. "
676,25," On this point Professor Goodman testified as follows: Q.  Now would you tell us what is involved statistically in economics whenever you take, for example, one unit, such as 
Crocker-Citizens, and put it with a group such as ""all others"" or put it with a group such as ""the first five,"" what is a 
statistican [sic] or economist trying to do when he does that? A.  One has many purposes in examining data.  One ordinarily groups data in order to draw off some significant 
conclusions relative to particular size or particular groups.  When he groups data, he must group data which will lend itself 
to such analysis. If one group, as we have in No. 1, the Bank of America with ""all others"" in this case, the two statistics taken as a group 
demonstrate that the Bank of America - as a result of its presence in many, many more local markets in the state of 
California than any other bank in the state of California, the accumulation of the sum total of the participation of the Bank of 
America in all of the local markets in California is so dominant a figure that if you were to add any other figures to the Bank 
of America, the result: No other individual banks could affect the end result that you would get, all the figures would be 
dominated by the Bank of America. It is like trying to combine a giant and a pigmy and say something about the size of a man by so doing.  They are two 
separate classes of men and you cannot draw off a conclusion as to the average of a man by combining a 20 foot giant with 
a 4 foot pigmy. Statistically this is impossible, to get relevant or meaningful figures from such a combination. Q.  And is this what occurs in the category No. 3, which shows the cumulative total for the first five banks? A. Yes.  The figure is dominated completely by the Bank of America.  No changes among the other four could very much 
affect the end result because when you add a giant, which is in a class all by itself, with the others, which fundamentally are 
in a completely different class, the sum total does not reflect like items.  It reflects two separate groupings of items. Q.  Sort of like saying Cashus [sic] Clay and Archer and Schoepke could lick any man in the courtroom.  It is a true 
statement but it doesn't show much about Archer's or Schoepke's physical prowess. A.  I think that's a fair statement. (Tr. 1766-1768) Judge Pope: On that last exhibit I would like to ask this witness a question (Exhibit BKYY). "
677,," Does your theory as to the effect of adding a very small peripheral concern to the market in which there is one dominant 
operator square with the theory that was developed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Aluminum Company 
case in which the Court said something like this - this is quoted from the Philadelphia Bank case, with which I think you are 
familiar - The Witness: Yes, sir. Judge Pope: ""It is no answer that, among the three presently largest firms . . . there will be no increase in concentration. If this argument 
were valid, then once a market has become unduly concentrated, further concentration would be legally privileged.  On the 
contrary, if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing even slight increases in concentration and so 
preserving the possibility of eventual deconcentration is correspondingly great."" And further down: ""The acquisition of Rome added, it is said, only 1.3 percent to Alcoa's control of the aluminum conductor market.  But in this 
setting that seems to us reasonably likely to produce a substantial lessening of competition of Section 7."" How does the theory that you expounded in respect to this last exhibit square with that? The Witness: All I have been talking about so far, Your Honor, is the question of a measurement of size. The question that you have asked me to address myself to is the significance of changes in competitors in a particular 
market, the effect on competition in that market of a change of competitors. You must, in order to do that, set up some measurement of size, study the tone of competition and come to some 
conclusion about the effect of competition. The example that you posed poses a situation where the number - the giant in your case, the Aluminum Company - in this 
case the Bank of America - were to combine with a pigmy, and the result would be an increase in the size of a giant as a 
result of merger on the tone of competition in that market and on the potential competition in that market. We do not have that situation in this case.  This is a completely different situation.  We have a situation where we have a 
giant and then many much smaller other competitors, and eventually, after - I will be glad to address myself to the question, 
of the effect on competition in this proposed market of a change in the relative size of two of the competitors in this market 
which has 200 competitors, on the tone of competition in that market at the present time and on the potentiality of 
competition.  In other words, that is the question we address ourselves to.  The example in the Aluminum case does not 
apply to this particular set of statistics. (Tr. 1769-1771) "

681,27," And if these counties could be said to be appropriate sections of the country in which to assess the impact of the merger, on 
the record before us, we would clearly find that any claimed lessening of competition, actual or potential, in these counties 
""would be de minimis"", just as we did for Ventura County when we denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.  
United States v. Crocker-Anglo Nat. Bank, [1963 TRADE CASES P70,934], 223 F. Supp. 849, 854 (N.D.Cal.). The record on this 
score is no better today than it was then. "
682,28," At the trial the court ruled as follows on the admissibility of customer lists (Tr. 462): Now, with respect to the failure of the Government to give the names of customers known to them as requested, at that 
stage we do not observe any prejudice to the defense. I don't know how you could ask for a better admission than, in effect, 
the admission by the Government, ""We don't know of any such customers."" In other words, it approaches a statement that, 
""We don't have any proof that there was such competition."" At any rate, our ruling has been indicated and we will proceed 
from there. That observation still applies and clearly points up plaintiff's failure to prove that there are customers in the statewide market and 
customers for whose business Crocker and Citizens competed. "
683,29," After admitting that Crocker and Citizens competed in different geographic areas, Professor Nicols suggested that some 
significance might be attached to the fact that both banks competed with branches of the Bank of America (Tr. 2276).  Citizens, 
however, was in direct competition with 50 to 80 other banks in the Los Angeles area, including some of the largest banks in the 
state and in the world (BK-Q; BK-Z; BK-PP).  Under those circumstances, a bank not actually operating in the area would have 
no effect upon local market conditions.  One could as well argue that because Crocker-Citizens competes with The Bank of 
California, and because The Bank of California competes with banks in Seattle and Portland, Crocker-Citizens competes with 
banks in Portland and Seattle.  A similar argument could be made with respect to the foreign banks having offices in California. It 
appears to us this argument was, in effect, made by other defendants and rejected in Crown Zellerbach v. FTC, 296 F.2d 800 
(9th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 937, 8 L. Ed. 2d 807, 82 S. Ct. 1581 (1962), and in United States v. Philadelphia Nat. 
Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963). Accordingly, this is not a case like United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 16 L. Ed. 2d 765, 86 S. Ct. 1665 (1966), 
where the Government proved a state market by showing actual competition between the two beer companies throughout 
Wisconsin, and in fact, the nation.  Instead, this is a case in which the Government's expert admitted that the defendants were 
not operating in the same geographical markets, the defendants proved that the combined banks did not compete against each 
other, and a survey of bank customers themselves showed that such competition did not exist.  In addition, at the second trial it 
was proved that the difference in interest rates (or conversely, risks) between Los Angeles and the Bay Area was further proof 
that they are different markets (Goodman, Tr. 2198). Neither can it be said that California is ""any section of the country "", in which Crocker and Citizens were competing against each 
other and in which the merger could reduce competition, as in Pabst.  The fact that beer manufactured in Milwaukee can be sold 
not only throughout Wisconsin but throughout the nation (e.g., Miller's High Life ""brewed in Milwaukee"") does not mean that the 
same is true of banking services.  Plaintiff has successfully and correctly proved that banking services are primarily local and 
that banks do business where they have offices."
683,30," Copies of the reports of the regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice letter referred to are attached to the 
Memorandum of Crocker-Anglo National Bank and Citizens National Bank in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed 
herein on October 8, 1963. "
684,31," As to banks able to give local services throughout the state, Professor Weston testified: Judge Zirpoli: This is what is disturbing me.  If you have a capacity to mobilize throughout the state in this fashion, such as 
Bank of America can do, why can it not be said that there is a relevant market, certainly as far as the Bank of America is 
concerned in the State of California. The Witness: For the reason that with regard to mobilizing funds, a bank is able to mobilize funds to the extent that it can 
locate offices to generate the acquisition of the funds. Now, the flow of funds into California, however, comes from outside the state as well, so even focusing on the flow of funds, 
the flow of funds  real magnitude or his loans get into the insurance money flows into the state, and so the point I am 
making is that in a capital deficit state in the supply of funds market that is national it is still desirable from the standpoint of 
that state to mobilize as effectively as possible the funds within the state area since the state must depend for financing its 
business and commercial and individual activities in substantial measure on funds outside the state, and I am saying that it 
is important that the funds within the state be mobilized as efficiently as possible.  But this doesn't indicate that this market 
is statewide because you have a flow of funds from outside the state from numerous types of institutions. Mr. Archer: Q.  Well, Professor Weston, what would you say about a state-wide market from the standpoint of a company 
that wanted to deal with only one bank in the state and had facilities throughout the state which could be served only by the 
Bank of America?  Would you consider that to be a market or - how would you consider that? A.  I would not consider that a market either.  There is a distinction that must be drawn between the performance of a 
particular type of banking service and the existence of a market.  For example, the national banking divisions of banks in 
California in seeking to obtain business in California from national accounts will stress the services that they can perform in 
California for these customers in connection with their California business.  Nevertheless, they still have to compete with 
out-of-state banks for the business of those national accounts in California, so that even though Bank of America might 
have the U.S. Steel account, it is subject to continuous competition with the Chicago and New York banks to handle the 
U.S. Steel account both nationally and even for their California activity. Q.  Well, suppose U.S. Steel, however, determines from the standpoint of its own policy that it is going to have its deposits 
made daily and its payrolls paid from its various locations in California: In Pittsburg, San Francisco, Los Angeles and 
Torrence? A.  Well, then, when you talk in those terms, I can see a basis on which one might argue that in connection with these 
services that there exists a market in some sense.  But in that market you have only the Bank of America, United California 
Bank, and, to some degree, First Western.  This merger would add a fourth competitor to that market, if that market exists "
685,," at all, and if that is regarded as a market under some definition, then this merger would decrease competition because it 
would add a fourth bank to a bank service activity in which only three banks exist today. Judge Pope: You said ""decrease competition"". The Witness: ""Decrease concentration."" I'm sorry. Increase competition and decrease concentration. (Weston, Tr. 1584-1587, line 3)"
685,32," The Bank of America grew to be the largest private bank in the world because its founder, A. P. Giannini, the greatest 
innovator in modern banking, recognized the need to serve ""the little fellow"" and understood that this could be effectively 
accomplished only through local branches offering a ""convenience of location"" to persons of moderate means.  That is why the 
House of Morgan declined as the Bank of America came up.  J. P. Morgan, the elder, was the banker for men of great wealth.  
Giannini was the banker for the locomotive firemen, who worked on the railroad systems Morgan unified, and the puddlers in the 
Morgan-financed steel mills.  The times favored Giannini and the leveling process, as far as money goes, less for the Haves and 
more for the Have Nots, proved to be a good thing for branch banking, for the Bank of America and for California.  And it is still "
686,," the "" convenience of location"" through its branches serving local needs that makes the Bank of America strong. It should be 
noted further that neither the dominant Bank of America, nor either of its two smaller statewide competitors, United California 
Bank or First Western Bank and Trust Co., was the product of de novo branch banking. Each achieved statewide status 
essentially through mergers, and in the case of United California Bank, as pointed out above, with the approval of the 
Department of Justice, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board.  This court is of the view that, giving proper consideration to 
problems of allocation of permits by the regulatory agencies, costs, location, personnel and the training thereof, it would not have 
been feasible to have created, as of this date, a truly statewide system of branch banking. "
689,33,"  The concentration statistics in this chapter are highly unorthodox.  Conventional concentration statistics in the field of 
banking are usually computed on a legalistic or political-jurisdictional base; hence, the common practice of showing 
concentration of banking resources on a statewide basis.  Statistics computed in this manner may conceivably serve 
legalistic or political purposes.  For economic analysis, such statistics are meaningless, or worse.  It is only by chance that 
statistics thus computed may sometimes find a place in economic investigations."" (Alhadeff, Monopoly and Competition in 
Banking, at p. 52, (1954)). The fallacy of using concentration figures alone to measure the impact of a merger in bank cases was pointed out by Chief 
Judge William E. Miller in the Nashville case referred to in note 1, supra.  In United States v. Third National Bank of Nashville, 
260 F. Supp. 869, 883 (M.D.Tenn.), he said: As already stated, no reliable extrapolation as to future prospects may safely be predicted upon concentration or market 
share figures alone.  But considering the totality of facts as to the institutions involved and as to the relevant market, a 
conclusion that the merger may substantially lessen competition in the future is wholly unwarranted.  Any other view would 
require the Court to close its eyes to facts which are far more convincing than any possible contrary conclusions which 
could be drawn from the market share or concentration statistics in this case. "
692,34," In this regard we note that one of the most significant of the Court's findings in Philadelphia Bank is absent, indeed is 
negatived here.  The number of banks in the Philadelphia area had been dropping precipitously, from 108 in 1947 to 42 in 1961.  
But in California, the number of banks and trust companies rose from 117 in 1960 to 200 in 1964.  (Annual Report of FDIC 
(1964), Chart on p. 144 measuring changes between December 31, 1960 and December 31, 1964).  This important factor runs 
directly contrary to plaintiff's theory of reduction of consumer choice."
692,35," The Comptroller testified: A.  This case was the subject of long, extensive public hearing by our office, during which these factors were gone into at 
great length by various witnesses. One of the prime considerations was the question of possible lessening of competition, and our conclusion at that time was 
that there were no two offices - or no single office, indeed, of these two institutions which were in competitive conflict, and 
therefore there was no competitive overlap and there could not be any elimination of competition, and certainly, a fortiori, 
any substantial lessening of competition in the circumstance.  This same factor applies here today, since the adoption of 
the new Bank Merger Act. Additionally, we have, as reaffirmed, in terms in the balancing test provided by the new statute, in other words, that the 
convenience and needs to the public clearly outweighs any lessening of competition, we affirm that the convenience and 
needs is amply demonstrated and will be more and more so in the years ahead; that while the Bank of America, as it sits in 
this banking structure in California, has done a formidable job, one not matched by any other commercial bank in the 
country, and a bank which I would in no sense ever derogate, does sit in a dominant position in this banking structure with 
competition of any effective sort arising only from one bank, namely, the United California Bank. I do not believe, on the basis of our day-to-day examination of and dealings with banks, that the First Western Bank and 
Trust Company, as alleged, is a substantial state-wide competitor and I do not believe that anyone who follows this 
developing picture here could so demonstrate. So that we are faced here with one really great institution, not only domestically, but internationally, the Bank of America, 
with but one formidable state-wide competitor, as that term is so loosely used throughout the parlance of antitrust law, in 
this case and also the banking business.  I say the United California Bank because it, as the keystone of a large bank-
holding company, the largest in the United States, Western Bank Corporation, actually has a competitive reach far 
exceeding any bank short of the Bank of America.  Reaches into 12 states and more than 25 banking institutions, and has 
the benefit of controlling the flow of loans and deposits and new business and other developments. Accordingly, we would change our opinion, original opinion, to the extent of stating that the merged bank is not the fourth 
largest bank as the result of the merger but, indeed, the fifth, since the United California Bank resource position would have 
to be measured by substantially all of the resources of the Western Bank Corporation amounting now to close to $7 billion, 
which would put it next to the Bank of America in size. Accordingly, therefore, it seems to us, as this matter has been continuously reexamined, that this merger affords the only 
second substantial possibility of founding a substantial, quote, state-wide, unquote, competitor to the Bank of America. (Tr. 2036-2038) "
694,36," Long after this case was submitted on briefs counsel for plaintiff sent to each member of this court copies of articles from The 
Wall Street Journal and the American Banker of June 9, 1967.  These articles, which are identical in language, state that Wells 
Fargo Bank, with its main office in San Francisco, announced plans for a major de novo branching campaign in Southern 
California, which if successful, would give California its sixth statewide commercial bank.  The President of the bank said the 
campaign program ""probably will get started early in 1968, with the opening of a major Los Angeles headquarters."" The program 
calls for the annual establishment of five or six offices.  The sending of these articles to influence the court is of questionable 
propriety.  They form no part of the record in this case, are hearsay, have not been subject to cross-examination, contemplate 
the opening of a branch five years after the instant merger, and their presentation to us now is rather presumptuous, when we 
consider that during the discovery proceedings and in the course of the trial of this case plaintiff branded as ""irrelevant"" its files 
on Wells Fargo. Furthermore, the establishment of a branch in Los Angeles in 1968 and a program for the possible establishment of five or six 
branches thereafter annually, even if a true expression of the bank's intent, proves nothing of true relevancy to this case, except 
possibly that if successful in its campaign to get permits (in an already overcrowded area where many others besides Wells 
Fargo will be permit applicants), locations and personnel, it can hope to have enough branches to qualify as a statewide in ten or 
twenty years, or, as the Comptroller put it, ""it would take Wells Fargo 136 years to become a branch by branch statewide 
competitor with Bank of America "". As we previously stated, the need for another competitor to the Bank of America was already 
urgent at the time of the merger, November 1, 1963, and not one to be achieved ten or twenty or 136 years thereafter. "
704,37," Plaintiff's expert, Gaffey, testified that such harmful effects should be observable in two or three years. "
705,38," Clarke testified as follows: Q.  Now, during the time, that period of time that you were a director [of Citizens], would you say that you were a 
representative of Transamerica on the Board? A.  I suppose I could be called that.  I was elected by their stock, stock they controlled, together with some other people. . . . . A.  I was on their Executive Committee . . . . (Tr. 1235) Q.  Could you tell us how you went about preparing this document? A.  Well, at this time, the date on this is December 1962, at this time active consideration was being given to the offer that 
had been made of an exchange of stock of Crocker for Citizens and I was very much convinced of the desirability of such 
an exchange.  I felt it was greatly in the interest of the stockholders of the bank, of the staff of the bank and of the 
customers and the general public, and I was an active and vigorous proponent of the merger. "
706,," There was opposition in the beginning, considerable serious opposition on the part of some of the other directors, some of 
the members of the Executive Committee, and we had many meetings about it and much discussion. . . . . . . . Therefore, I do this as a, what I considered like a sales approach, it was a sales approach, it was all the arguments I could 
think of to back up my claim that the merger was most desirable and I tried to do a selling job in preparing this argument 
and develop the various facts that appear in it as to - from data of various sorts that I gathered, had gathered.  (Tr. 1238-
1239). A.  Yes, that's right, this is dated February 7, 1963.  This is the one that I read aloud to the Board of Directors and provided 
each, presented each one of them with a copy of it.  (Tr. 1241) A. I showed a copy of it to - in fact, gave a copy of it to Mr. Brauer as a Chairman of the Board of Transamerica and a copy 
to Mr. John Beckett, the President of Transamerica, because they were such large stockholders and they were cognizant of 
what I was doing and I gave them copies of it about the time they were made. . . . . A. . . . the merger could not be made without their full cooperation, full approval, and so they knew everything I was doing 
about that because I had originally heard about the offer through Mr. Beckett.  (Tr. 1242). A.  Yes, it was voted on after this was presented, this second document dated February 7, it was voted on in a meeting, I 
think, the 19th of February 1963 and both the argument for and the argument against were presented at that time.  (Tr. 
1247-1248). Q.  Then, Mr. Clarke, since you prepared these two documents, the opinions that appear in there are yours, are they not? A.  They are my opinions, they are my guesses as to a lot of things.  It was my sales argument.  (Tr. 1249). Mr. Archer: May I ask one question? Q.  Mr. Clarke, do you have any information about what Crocker-Anglo's plans for branching were other than what appears 
right in the memorandum itself? A.  None whatsoever. Q.  Did you negotiate this at all with either Mr. Hoover or Mr. Solomon? A.  I never saw nor talked to nor had correspondence with either Mr. Hoover or Mr. Solomon during the negotiations.  In 
fact, I had never met Mr. Solomon until after the merger agreement was signed . . . .  And only saw Mr. Hoover, although I 
knew him, I had known him a number of years before, but I only saw them for the first time sometime after the merger 
agreement in the spring of '63.  (Tr. 1250-1251). The court thereafter, ruling on the offer of G-329 and G-330 in evidence, through Judge Pope, said: Now, this tends to confirm what he has said in respect to his activities, and we therefore think that it is admissible solely for 
the purpose, as against Transamerica and as against Citizens, to show that they collaborated in bringing about this merger. So far as the opinions in there are expressed, we regard those as wholly inadmissible and they will be disregarded by the 
Court, particularly the opinion as to what Crocker-Anglo might do, because this witness has not shown himself to be privy to 
the inter-workings of the management of Crocker-Anglo. So if it is expected by the Government that this will tend to prove what the plans and purposes and intent of Crocker-Anglo 
would have been at that time, we regard that as wholly inadmissible and when it was first offered we regarded that as so 
entirely inadmissible and prejudicial that we first ruled that it would not be admitted for any purpose. But for the limited purposes which I have just stated, it will be received.  We do not regard it as any proof whatsoever as to 
the purposes and intentions of Crocker-Anglo, in fact, the witness, if I heard him accurately, said it contained some of his 
guesses. That is the ruling of the Court.  It is admissible for the limited purposes indicated as against Transamerica and Citizens only.

Commission observed: ""We have considered the possibility of authorizing one or the other of the applicants herein to acquire control of Western 
Pacific subject to a solicitation condition to safeguard the central route of Western Pacific similar to the condition imposed in 
the Central Pacific case.  However, the situation here does not contain the element of intermingled properties and 
operations necessitating the control authorization in the Central Pacific case, and, moreover, Santa Fe has recorded its 
objection to any condition which would require solicitation from its own territories for Western Pacific, either to the West or 
East of the Utah gateways."" Southern Pacific Co. - Control - Western Pacific R.R., 327 I.C.C. 387, 400 (1965)."
739,8," The other relevant conditions generally required the Southern Pacific to cooperate or join the Union Pacific in maintaining 
service, schedules and rates via the Ogden Gateway and the line of the Central Pacific. "
740,9," Plaintiffs urge that in 1923 it was the mutual understanding of the parties, including the Rio Grande, that condition (e) was in 
furtherance of the Pacific Railroad Acts and therefore should not be set aside.  Apropos here is Mr. Justice Brennan's statement 
that ""the ICC is not prisoner of the parties' submissions."" See Baltimore & O. R.R. v. United States, 386 U.S. 372, 430, 87 S. Ct. 
1100, 1129, 18 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1967) (concurring opinion). "
741,10," The Union Pacific openly acknowledges this construction in a footnote on page 67 of Union Pacific's brief, when it argues: ""The 1864 Pacific Railroad Act prohibits 'any discrimination of any kind in favor of the road or business of any or either of 
said companies and adverse to the road or business of any or either of the others.' Yet to compel Southern Pacific only to 
solicit the Central Pacific portion of the Central Pacific-Union Pacific route is discrimination in favor of the Central Pacific 
portion.  This is quite apart from the fact that Southern Pacific solicitation via Rio Grande is discrimination against Union 
Pacific."" "
742,11," This section is now codified as 45 U.S.C. ยง 82. Congress recognized that the Act might be further amended when it said: ""And be it further enacted, That congress may, at any time, alter, amend, or repeal this act."" 13 Stat. 356 ยง 22.  And as observed 
in Union Pac. Ry. v. Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. supra, 163 U.S. at 589, 16 S. Ct. at 1183: ""On June 15, 1866, an act was approved, [c. 124, 14 Stat. 66,] 'to facilitate commercial, postal and military communication 
among the several states,' carried forward as section 5258 of the Revised Statutes, which provided that 'every railroad 
company in the United States, whose road is operated by steam, its successors and assigns, be, and is hereby, authorized 
to carry upon and over its road, boats, bridges and ferries, all passengers, troops, government supplies, mails, freights and 
property on their way from any state to another state, and to receive compensation therefor, and to connect with roads of 
other states so as to form continuous lines for the transportation of the same to the place of destination.'"""
742,12," Despite numerous attempts during the Congressional debates to cut off the proposed branch lines, the majority consistently 
voted to retain them for such reasons as Senator Wade of Ohio expressed in his speech of June 19, 1862: ""I believe the branches are as essential as the main trunk; that they will assist in building it; that they will furnish a motive for 
the embarking of money in the main line. It will be a mighty lonesome business to commence the main line in a mere 
wilderness, where it has nothing to attach itself to.  You have got to begin it where it will seem to the world of no use 
whatever.  Why, sir, it is like building a bridge across a magnificent river and never framing your abutments, by which you 
can get on to it.  I do not think it is best that this should be done."" Cong.  Globe, 37th Cong., 2d Sess. 2807 (1862). In Section 9 of the 1862 Act, the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company of Kansas was granted authority to 
build a line from a point on the Missouri River in Kansas to the Union Pacific line to the north, ""upon the same terms and 
conditions in all respects as are provided in this act for the construction of the railroad and telegraph line first mentioned * * *."" In 
Section 13, the Hannibal and St.  Joseph Railroad Company of Missouri was specifically authorized to connect itself to the new 
transcontinental route. In the amendatory act passed in 1864, which is to be construed together with the 1862 Act (14 Opinions 
of Atty. Gen. 233 (1873)), Congress further authorized the Kansas railroad companies to make connection with the proposed 
Union Pacific line where practicable or desirable; in addition, if the Union Pacific company by the time of such connection was "
743,," not ""proceeding in good faith to build the said railroad through the territories,"" the Kansas company was authorized to take over 
the project and build to the junction with the Central Pacific.  Sections 9, 12.  In Section 18, the Burlington and Missouri Railroad 
Company was given specific authority to join its line to the Union Pacific. For discussion of the decision to include branches and 
connecting lines within the scope of the Acts, see Russell, Improvement of Communication with the Pacific Coast as an Issue in

grounds, 259 U.S. 214, 42 S. Ct. 496, 66 L. Ed. 907 (1922): ""Those statutes require physical connection with the Union Pacific to make a through line and the furnishing of equal

747,17," See National Transportation Policy, S.Rep.No. 445, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 260-61 (1961)."
747,18," The agreement states, ""the parties * * * shall cooperate to secure by active solicitation the routing of the maximum of freight 
traffic via Union Pacific and Central Pacific lines * * *. ""It is understood that such traffic as has origin or destination east of the Missouri River will be solicited and routed via the 
Union Pacific between the Missouri River and Ogden, and via the Southern Pacific west of Ogden; such traffic as has origin 
or destination west of the Missouri River will be solicited and routed via Ogden so as to afford Union Pacific and Southern 
Pacific respectively the longest practicable haul."" "
748,19," As the parties, including the Interstate Commerce Commission, have observed in their briefs and arguments, solicitation on a 
reciprocal basis, as well as routing, are to some degree found in industry practices.  We note the discussion in Conant, Railroad 
Mergers and Abandonments 34-35 (1964): ""If the shipper does not control the entire routing of shipment, the initial carrier will be free to choose which connecting 
carriers will transport the shipment to its final destination.  At major connecting points, such as Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas 
City, and Omaha, an initiating carrier must choose which of a number of connecting lines should receive shipments bound 
for major cities on two or more routes. In the absence of price competition, the choice is usually made on the principle of 
reciprocity.  A railroad transfers to connecting carriers as many cars as it receives from them, or, if traffic is not balanced in 
both directions, a railroad transfers cars to connecting carriers in some proportion to cars received. ""But the reciprocity of interchange of connecting railroads is not short-term.  A railroad will develop long-run interchange 
preference patterns to protect its own longest hauls by favoring connecting carriers that are not its rivals for any segment of 
traffic. Thus, the Chicago and North Western, which has a main line from Chicago to Omaha, has established wide 
interchange with the complementary Union Pacific which extends from Omaha west to Denver, Ogden, and Portland.  
Neither the North Western nor the Union Pacific has substantial interchange at Omaha with the Rock Island or the 
Burlington, both of whose lines run from Chicago to Denver and thus rival the North Western and part of the Union Pacific."" "
749,1," ""Branch lines"" and ""main trunk"" were the descriptions often given of the system in the Congressional debates; in particular the 
quotation offered by the majority.  Cong. Globe 37th Cong.2nd Session, 2807 [1862]."
749,2," Senator Sherman offered the following argument for private ownership of the branch lines: ""I hope that this proposition, which 
will add another prong to this many-pronged railroad, will be voted down, and that the proposition of the Senator from New 
Hampshire will be adopted, and that we may agree upon the construction of one main Pacific railroad, which may be promptly 
constructed, and give such reasonable aid as we can to diverging routes, all pointing to the main line, and I think that all these 
diverging lines ought to be under different corporations.  There is one part of this bill that I do not like.  I do not wish to criticise it, 
but I do not think the Pacific Railroad Company ought to build any of these diverging lines.  They ought to be built by different 
companies so that all the diverging lines will compete with each other, and compete with each other fairly, while they all pour 
their streams of commerce into one great line, which is aided by the Government.  But under the operation of the bill as you 
have it now framed, the Pacific Railroad Company will own one of these branch lines, and may to the sacrifice of other interests 
involved in these roads divert the whole travel and transportation to one line, thus destroying the property in which you yourself 
invest to the tune of $16,000 a mile.  I think it would be much wiser to leave these various branches to be built by the local 
interests concerned."" Cong.Globe, 37th Cong., 2nd Sess., 2784 [1862]."
749,3," That case was an action for specific performance of certain contracts entered into by the Union Pacific and the Chicago, Rock 
Island and Pacific Railway Company and the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company in which the Union Pacific had 
leased the use of their bridge across the Missouri to the two latter named companies.  The Union Pacific claimed that it had no 
authority to lease the use of its lines and that the contract was therefore ultra vires.  The Court found that the contract did not 
disable the Union Pacific from fulfilling its obligations to the public.  The Court then cited the Pacific Railroad Acts as authority for 
the proposition that the Congressional policy favored ""continuous lines"".  ""It is impossible for us to ignore the great public policy "
750,," in favor of continuous lines thus declared by congress, and that it is in effectuation of that policy that such business 
arrangements as will make such connections effective are made."" Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Chicago, R.I. and P. Ry. Co., 163 
U.S. 564, at 589, 16 S. Ct. 1173, at 1183, 41 L. Ed. 265."
750,4," I refer particularly to United States v. Union Pac. R.R., 226 U.S. 61, 33 S. Ct. 53, 57 L. Ed. 124 [1912].  As I read that case the 
Court made two observations which are important here.  First, they found that the Pacific Railroad Acts require more than mere 
physical connection. The Court then listed reasons why they believe that physical connection was not the only requirement; but 
they did not proceed to define the obligations which did exist.  Some light is shed on the question, however, by another comment 
contained in that opinion.  While the Court was not disturbed about discrimination by Southern Pacific against the Rio Grande, 
they stated definitely that such discrimination against the Union Pacific would be contrary to the Act. ""Such practices of systematic and preconcerted discrimination as are said to have destroyed the Rio Grande's carrying 
trade as a connection for the East for business at Ogden would have violated the statute as discriminations adverse to the 
Union Pacific and be equally violative of the letter and spirit of the acts of Congress.  * * *"" 226 U.S. at 92, 33 S. Ct. at 59. I believe that the opinion clearly indicates that the Union Pacific and Central Pacific were to be given special treatment because 
of the Acts that created them.  While the extent of their rights is not defined, their existence is nevertheless acknowledged. "

754,2," Each of the networks, however, is owner and licensee of 5 local stations -- the maximum permitted by FCC regulations.  See 
Amendment of Multiple Ownership Rules, 18 Fed. Reg. 7796, 9 P. & F.R.R. 1563 (FCC 1953). Where the program is not a network program, the station is free to sell the broadcast time on that program directly to advertisers."
754,3," Such sales are known as sales on the ""local market."" The time released for local sales was, however, subject to recapture on 3 
weeks' notice.  In this connection, it should be noted that ABC had two types of affiliation agreements -- ""primary"" and 
""secondary"" -- which contained different terms.  The vast majority of clearing stations were primary affiliates and the description 
in the text is of their relation with ABC.  (For example, of the 95 stations that had cleared ""Evening Report"" in August 1961, 
approximately 90 per cent were primary affiliates which had their major network association with ABC.) "
755,4," The program was offered for periods of 13 or 26 weeks for each weekday in one-quarter hour segments. The estimated lineup 
was 110 stations and the approximate gross was $34,500.  This was based on rate card time charges for the clearing stations to 
which was added a program charge of $5,000, a 15 per cent commission of $750, and a networking charge of $500.  A ""Special 
Discount"" of 35 per cent off rate card was offered for the purchase of 2 quarter-hour segments over 26 weeks (or $28,675, 
including all charges) and a 30 per cent discount (or $30,400 in toto) was offered if 1 quarter-hour was taken."

755,6," Id. at 1347.  The legality of these practices under the principles of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13, has received 
much attention but is not now before us.  See generally articles cited in note 1."
755,7," In the record, the precise number of unwanted stations is sometimes said to be 32 and at other times 35.  Apparently 3 
unwanted stations were added to the lineup after Kemper accepted ABC's terms. "
756,8," The state court chose not to adjudicate the validity of the contract under the antitrust laws although it indicated that on its face 
the contract was enforceable.  42 Misc. 2d 939, 249 N.Y.S. 2d 481 (1963), aff'd, 20 App. Div. 2d 890, 251 N.Y.S. 2d 906 (1st 
Dept. 1964), aff'd, 17 N.Y. 2d 849, 218 N.E. 2d 324, 271 N.Y.S. 2d 284, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 931, 87 S. Ct. 291, 17 L. Ed. 2d 
213 (1966). ABC does not contend that the state court judgment bars Kemper from pressing the instant litigation. "
757,9," In light of the history of the Kemper-ABC agreement one may suspect that the claim of Sherman Act illegality was an 
afterthought to justify having broken a contract that had turned sour.  And, it is understandable that the District Court looked with 
a jaundiced eye on Kemper's allegations that it was coerced into accepting all 130 stations. But, ""that it might be surmised that 
the adverse party is unlikely to prevail at the trial is not sufficient to authorize summary judgment against him."" 3 Barron & 
Holtzoff, supra, ยง 1234, at 132. "
759,10," Compare Blake & Blum, supra, at 1385-86: ""Characterizing the network's discount practices as tying arrangements does not 
present the difficulties encountered by the Court in Times-Picayune.  Even assuming the Court there had sound basis for 
treating readership of the morning and evening papers as homogenous, which seems doubtful, network tie-ins are of much more 
distinct products.  Evening and afternoon viewers of television, for example, constitute a substantially different market, as do 
viewers in New York and Dubuque.  Furthermore, the morning and evening papers effected critical economies by leaving ad 
materials intact in page layouts from morning to evening editions.  Network time tie-ins have no comparable claim to achieving 
economic efficiency."""
759,11," Amana has not received a welcome reception from the commentators.  See, e.g., Blake & Blum, supra at 1379-80; Columbia 
Note, supra at 1232-34."
759,12," The Sherman Act, of course, is not limited to ""commodities."" "
760,13," A number of commentators have argued that the sales of commercial time over different television stations constitute different 
products for purpose of tie-in analysis.  See, e.g., Schwartz, Antitrust and the FCC: The Problem of Network Dominance, 107 U. 
Pa. L. Rev. 753, 779-80 (1959). ABC seeks to explain away such authorities by pointing out that they deal with ""must buy"" 
practices by the networks and it asserts it does not have a ""must buy policy."" That may well be true but it misses the point.  An 
analysis that ""must buy"" constitutes an illegal tie-in necessarily presupposes that the sale of time over different stations 
constitutes more than one product."
760,14," For example, Kemper claims that in May 1963 General Mills purchased 69 stations from a master lineup of 106 stations; that 
in February 1964 Armour & Co. bought 37 stations out of a lineup of 109 and Sun Oil bought 44 of 104 stations."
760,15," We note in this connection that the actual holding of Jerrold was that the defendant was justified in treating the ""components"" it 
sold as one ""product"" only for a short period following its introduction as a new ""product,"" 187 F. Supp. at 559-61. And, we have 
stated that ""tying arrangements have been given short shrift under the antitrust laws."" Susser v. Carvel Corp., supra, 332 F.2d at 
512."
760,16," Neither party has cited, and we have not found, any recent study of the FCC dealing with these problems.  And generally, the 
FCC appears not to have been overly concerned with antitrust considerations. See Schwartz, Antitrust and the FCC: The 
Problem of Network Dominance, supra note 13, 781-86. "
761,17," Similarly, we voice no opinion on the rule of law that would apply if a sponsor demanded a lineup of two or three stations. See 
Pearson, Tying Arrangements and Antitrust Policy, supra at 628-29, commenting on Judge Cooper's opinion below.  We will 
cross that bridge when we come to it. "
762,18," As we understand the parties' contentions, there are two different equations submitted for arriving at the figures in Kemper's 
May 4th order.  Kemper claims it was willing to pay for 67 of 99 stations the $15,750 ABC was asking for the full lineup of 99.  It 
asserts that it added to this figure the $3,000 charge for the 28 additional stations it wanted, to arrive at the $18,750 station time 
charge found in its May 4th order.  ABC claims that Kemper treated all 99 stations as fungible and deducted a proportional 
amount ($2,871.23) for the 32 unwanted stations from the time charge used at the April 27th meeting. It then added $5,588.88 -- 
the discounted rate for the 28 stations it wanted -- to arrive at a figure of $18,467.65, which was rounded to $18,750 in the May 
4th letter. It is apparent that either theory would account for the figure Kemper used.  While it is relatively clear that Kemper, in an intra-
office memo sometime previous to the April 27th meeting, employed the method of computation suggested by ABC, an official of 
the Frank agency swore in an affidavit submitted on the motion that these earlier computations were not reflected in Kemper's 
orders.  We have already indicated in part II that on a motion for summary judgment, with no opportunity to evaluate the 
demeanor of the witnesses, it is not the function of the court to determine whether the affiant is telling the truth or that he seems 
""persuasive."" We note in this connection that it is not obvious to us why Kemper should have used a figure of $5,588.88 for the 
28 extra stations when ABC had previously stated at the April 27th meeting that it would agree to charge only $3,000. "
763,19," The District Court placed great emphasis on a number of Kemper memoranda that did not indicate the lineup problem was of 
importance to the company.  The significance of many of these documents without further evidence must be discounted, 
however, since they were written after Kemper alleges it capitulated to ABC's demands."
763,20," We frankly find the positions advanced by both parties in this summary proceeding somewhat puzzling and incongruous.  
Kemper claims it refused extra stations although they would cost nothing additional because it could not adequately service 
potential customers.  ABC, on the other hand, apparently insisted that Kemper take something for nothing, allegedly because it 
would be expensive to cut out the unwanted stations. But when Kemper ordered its limited lineup, ABC did not respond ""you can 
have your lineup at the package rate but you will, of course, have to pay any expenses we will incur by cutting out stations."" 
Instead, it spoke of ""rate card and then some"" -- to an important customer -- although it is clear that it apparently never charged 
anyone rate card. The only fact of possible monetary significance that we can detect between Kemper's offer and ABC's 
counteroffer is that Kemper stipulated that the charge ""shall be reduced by the package rate of any station not clearing."" But the 
maximum price effect appears to be relatively insignificant and it does not rationalize for us the positions of the parties."
763,21," Another issue, not raised by ABC, which could well be explored before confronting the important and difficult problem of 
application of the ""tie-in"" principle to network broadcasting, is the possible bearing of Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 3 L. Ed. 2d 
475, 79 S. Ct. 429 (1959). The principal, indeed almost the sole, item of damage which plaintiffs seek to recover is the state 
court judgment for their breach of contract committed for a reason wholly unrelated to the antitrust laws; if, under Kelly, the 
antitrust laws did not give Kemper a valid antitrust defense to that suit, they can hardly permit it to recover three times the 
amount of the judgment. The case arguably differs from Kelly in that here the contract included the sale of something alleged to 
constitute an illegal tie-in; however, it is also unlike Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., 340 F.2d 753 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 
382 U.S. 820, 86 S. Ct. 47, 15 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1965) in that, although the record is not completely clear on this point, the price for 
the entire package of 130 stations appears to have been no greater than Kemper was willing to pay for the 95 stations they 
wanted.  We note also that the discussion in Kelly assumed that there was a ""lawful sale for a fair consideration,"" 358 U.S. at 
521, a fact upon which the District Court made no findings. "
766,1," "" THE STATEMENT OF JOHN MACILVANE FOR U.D.F. KQV -- June 10, 1966 The fact that the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission approves of the audit (ah) of the Otto books means nothing. It only 
means that they are (ah) approving the conniving and carrying-ons between Otto and the DCSA to water down the (ah) price the 
farmers actually receives for his milk. Now the facts are that the farmer himself he gets his milk checked at at end of the month

know."" (Emphasis supplied). "
775,1," The value assigned to books issued by the trading stamp companies is considered a trade secret.  Because of this it is unlikely 
that one could determine a valuation for the stamps consistent with fair trade prices set by Corning.  Such difficulty seems to be 
inherent in the nature of trading stamp operations."
775,2," See Exhibit J 12, Appendix of Respondent Corning Glass Works reproduced. "
776,3," Because we hold that Corning could properly exempt trading stamp companies from enforcement of its fair trade program and 
enforce its program against Vornado, we do not reach and voice no opinion on the question of whether Corning would be liable 
to Vornado under the Sherman Act if the trading stamp companies could not properly be exempted. "
777,4," Corning includes as part of its fair trade agreements with retailers the requirement that stamps issued in connection with a sale 
of a Corning product shall not exceed 3% of the fair trade price of the product.  This protects Corning items from being 
demeaned by the retailer offering large stamp bonuses in connection with a purchase of Corning Ware."
777,5," We think that the result suggested, i.e., abandonment by Corning of its fair trade policy would almost necessarily result.  
Corning could not make an exception to Vornado's failure to preserve Corning's fair trade program and not give similar 
concessions to all retailers selling its products.  Vornado's trading stamp program as operated by it seems to us obviously a 
price cutting ploy. "
786,1," This quotation is taken from an article by Professor Wigmore in the April, 1929, issue of The Journal of The American 
Judicature Society, reading in part as follows: ""Law and justice are from time to time inevitably in conflict.  That is because law is 
a general rule (even the stated exceptions to the rules are general exceptions); while justice is the fairness of this precise case "
787,," under all its circumstances. . . . Law-the rule-MUST be enforced-the exact terms of the rule, justice or no justice. . . . Now this is 
where the jury comes in.  The jury, in the privacy of its retirement, adjusts the general rule of law to the justice of the particular 
case.  Thus the odium of inflexible rules of law is avoided, and popular satisfaction is preserved. . . . That is what jury trial does.  
It supplies that flexibility of legal rules which is essential to justice and popular contentment.  And that flexibility could never be 
given by judge trial.  The judge . . . must write out his opinion, declaring the law and the findings of fact.  He cannot in this public 
record deviate one jot from those requirements.  The jury, and the secrecy of the jury room, are the indispensable elements in 
popular justice."""

789,3," A canvas of Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's accounts revealed that 2.84% by number came from the excluded counties.  
The reason Philadelphia Saving Fund Society was used as a sampling device was that it was the only financial institution in the 
four-county area which broke down its accounts on a county basis.  (Intervenor's brief p. 30). "
791,4," A case in point is finance companies which allegedly compete with commercial banks in the consumer loan field.  However, the 
rates of interest at a finance company are substantially higher (N.T. 50) and the majority of a finance company's source of funds 
is derived from commercial banks.  Thus, finance companies cannot be said to be in direct competition with commercial banks, 
since they derive most of their lendable funds from commercial banks and assume loan risks which commercial banks would be 
unwilling to take. "
792,5," Derek Bok, after examining the various structural approaches, felt that Courts or agencies, in assessing mergers, should look 
to the change that has taken place in the aggregate share possessed by the largest firms in the market.  The number of firms 
selected for this purpose should be large enough to include the acquiring firm.  The merger should then be disallowed if the 
aggregate share of the market following the acquisition substantially exceeds (by 7%-8% or more) the aggregate share of the 
market controlled by the same number of firms at any time during a period reasonably prior to the acquisition, e.g., (5-10 years).  
This rule should be subject to an exception where the share of the acquiring firm following the merger is no larger than it was in 
the base period.  Bok, supra. George Stigler, in his article ""Mergers and Preventive Antitrust Policy"", 104 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 176 (1955), also dealt with 
concentration ratios and the question of at what point should mergers be deemed violative of Section 7.  The center of 
controversy, according to Stigler, arises somewhere in between what can be characterized as a competitive industry where the 
largest firm controls 10% or less of output and the non-competitive industries where 2-5 firms control 75% or more of output.  
Every merger which produces a firm controlling 20% of the industry's output should be presumed violative under the statute.  In 
other mergers below this proscriptive percentage, several factors must be examined: (1) ease of entry into the market, (2) rate of 
industry growth, and (3) closeness of substitute products made by other industries."
792,6," Congressman Patman stated in 112 Cong.Rec. 2334 (Feb. 8, 1966) that ""It should be made very clear that there is no intent on 
the part of the (House) Committee to change the application of the antitrust laws as they apply to bank mergers. If the 
Committee had wanted to do this, it would simply have exempted bank mergers from the application of antitrust laws . . . . This 
bill is intended to have the effect of making the bank supervisory agencies give substantially more emphasis to the antitrust 
standards in determining the competitive effects of a merger than they did under the 1960 law . . .."" The only effect this amended Act has upon traditional antitrust law is that for bank mergers, the anticompetitive standard is no 
longer to be the sole criterion for adjudging the merits of the merger. Courts must also consider convenience and needs.

797,11," Since the ratio of time to demand deposits is 40-60 in the four-county area, we took the resultant bank's share of 2.74% in the 
time and savings account category and added this figure to 60% of 11.7%, which is 7%, giving us a total of 9.74%."
797,12," Competition from other financial institutions for mortgage loans was not computed since the ratio of these mortgages to total 
loans was not known.  However, we do know that commercial banks held 12.52% of the total mortgage loans in the four-county 
area with the remainder being held by mutual savings banks and saving and loan associations about equally.  The resultant 
bank would control.95% or less than 1% of the total mortgage loans in the four-county area.  Thus, the proposed merger would 
not be anticompetitive in this specific market.  (Defendants' Exhibit 20)."
797,13," This distinction was recognized by the Supreme Court in Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. United States, supra, 370 U.S. at 320:

competition, not competitors, and its desire to restrain mergers only to the extent that such combinations may tend to lessen 
competition."""

outweighed by benefits to the community.  The argument need not be pursued, however, since we hold that the District Court

none of us in the group had any commercial banking experience, and that was a serious problem. ""But we concluded that if we were unable to devote our full time to the affairs of the bank, it would be in the best interests of the 
customers of the bank, the employees of the bank, the stockholders of the bank, and the Nashville community, for us to merge

amounted to confiscation of gas underlying the large tracts. In Railroad Comm'n v. Aluminum Company of America, 380 S.W.2d 
599 (Tex. 1964), however, the court upheld the formula insofar as it applied to the Appling Field on the ground that the large 
tract owners were guilty of laches in attacking it.  Although the court recognized that small-tract owners had drained substantial 
quantities of gas from beneath the large tracts, and had recouped their costs and made a profit, and would during the life of the 
field drain several million dollars worth of gas from beneath tracts leased to Aluminum Company of America alone, id. at 604, it 
found other factors to be more persuasive. ""There are many reasons why stability in respect to proration formulas is vital to the well being of the industry as a whole, to 
the property owners in the field and to the public at large.  It is a matter of common knowledge that well owners are not 
alone concerned.  Individuals and institutions have invested in royalties and other oil and gas interests.  Loans have been 
made with these properties as security, and taxes have been levied by various municipal and school authorities.  It is well 
known that the economy of the whole state rests to a large extent on the oil and gas business."" Ibid. "

and 18 wells were completed therein.  Seventeen of these wells were located on 7.132 acres, while the remaining well was 
situated on a 328 acre unit. . . . The total delivery capacity of all 18 wells was approximately 898,000 MCF per month, and the 
production forecasts resulted in the determination that reasonable market demand, and hence the reservoir allowable, for the 
month was approximately 880,000 MCF.  Under the basic 1/3 - 2/3 allocation formula, the large tract well was entitled to an 
allowable of 591,000 MCF. . . . The productive capacity of the single large tract well was only about 34,000 MCF, and in

883,7," In some instances, Congress has recognized that there is a basic conflict between the competitive thrust of the antitrust laws 
and the anticompetitive thrust of state regulatory schemes.  For instance, in the area of insurance, Congress has sought to 
eliminate friction which might result because of simultaneous application of both laws. ""No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That 
after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act [15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1 et seq.] and the Act 
of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal 
Trade Commission Act, as amended [15 U.S.C. ยงยง 41 et seq.], shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the 
extent that such business is not regulated by State law."" McCarran Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1012(b) (1963); see Miley v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 148 F. Supp. 299 (D. Mass. 
1957). A comparable forthright approach to resolving similar conflicts in the oil and gas area would not be inappropriate, for there 
are many parallels between state regulation of both industries, state regulation of both being equally comprehensive and 
detailed. The federal courts have been careful to avoid applying the Sherman Act where its application might conflict with the Federal 
Power Commission's regulation of the natural gas industry.  Interstate Nat. Gas Co. v. Southern California Gas Co., 102 F. 
Supp. 685, 103 F. Supp. 317 (S.D. Cal. 1952), aff'd, 209 F.2d 380 (9th Cir. 1953). Moreover, the activities made the subject 
matter of the instant suit involve Railroad Commission regulations concerning the production and gathering of natural gas from 
the Appling Field, and this subject Congress has chosen to exempt from federal supervision in favor of state regulation. Natural 
Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 717(b) (1963).  Therefore, since these activities are subject to exclusive regulation by the Texas Railroad 
Commission, a like caution and deference should be shown when the alleged Sherman Act violation involves Railroad 
Commission regulations and matters subject to the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction. "
884,8," For example, in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr

courts were reversed for imposing liability.  Also, there appears to be a conflict on whether joinder of the state official who uses 
his office to impose the restraint makes a difference on whether the private party can be held liable.  Compare Harman v. Valley 
Nat'l Bank of Arizona, 339 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1964), with Miley v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 148 F. Supp. 299 (D. Mass.

Constitutionally guaranteed, unrestricted privilege to engage in business free of competition.""  If this means that exclusive dealing contracts violate the anti trust laws only if they abrogate existing contracts between one of 
the parties thereto and others, then it is wrong and the quicker corrected the better.  The right of the private utility is that it not be 
foreclosed from the market, which may or may not involve breach of an existent contract. "
913,1," Unless otherwise designated, numbers in parentheses refer to pages in the stenographer's minutes of the trial. "
928,1," The reason for this, as stated by the government, is that when the owner of an offshore vessel operates it for another person, 
the owner is deemed to be engaged in the business of carrying passengers or freight for hire and is thereby subjected to certain 
Coast Guard regulations which increase the cost of operating the vessels. The applicability of the regulations may be avoided by 
the use of the bareboat charter and a manning company, thus decreasing costs.  However, this assertion was never developed 
by the government, and we have no reason to believe that it would affect the outcome of this case. "
929,2," The government's complaint, alleging that Twenty Grand owns ""16 large offshore, ocean-going tugboats"" and that Tidewater 
owns ""29 tugs,"" claims that the merger of the defendants' towing operations would also violate ยง 7.  However, the government 
has failed to offer any evidence whatsoever regarding this claim.  In its brief at footnote 2 on pages 8-9, the government, 
candidly admitting that it was unable to go forward on this claim, virtually abandoned it.  Likewise, the government has 
completely failed to offer any evidence relevant to its broad allegations concerning the agreement between Tidex and Pan 
Marine. Consequently, we may exclude all of these allegations from our present consideration of this case."
929,3," See footnote 7, infra. "
930,4," The practical indicia clearly enunciated in Brown Shoe were based upon criteria well established by lower courts.  See Bock, 
Mergers and Markets (3rd ed. 1964) pp. 96-111, (2nd ed. 1962) pp. 56-68, and cases cited therein. "
932,5," The fact that Elmes and Twenty Grand have engaged in some negotiations designed to effect the purchase by Elmes of 
Twenty Grand's ownership in Twenty Grand Pacific is also irrelevant and does not preclude our consideration of the West Coast 
as a relevant market. There is no certainty or even probability that Elmes will buy out Twenty Grand.  Such negotiations directed 
to possible future developments do not alter the present effect of the Tidewater-Twenty Grand merger upon competition. "
934,6," This underlying evidence offers support, albeit scanty, only for the government's allegations as to the boats available for charter 
off the United States coasts which includes boats of United States Registry operating in foreign waters. It offers no support 
whatsoever for the tabulated allegations as to the total number of boats which actually operate in United States coastal waters. 
The former is directed to potential competition while the latter is directed to actual competition.  The government did not draw 
any distinction between the two nor did it offer any evidence as to the likelihood or feasibility of vessels operating in foreign 
waters returning to domestic competition.  Without such a showing the only proper yardstick with which to measure competition 
is the number of boats which actually operate offshore the United States.  See, e.g., United States v. Crocker-Anglo Nat'l Bank, 
277 F. Supp. 133 (N.D. Cal. 1967). It does seem highly unlikely that the government would be able to show that there is a 
reasonable probability of such potential competition becoming real in view of the fact, noted above, that boats on the West Coast 
do not compete with boats on the Gulf Coast due to the prohibitive expense of commuting back and forth which would appear 
even more prohibitive for boats operating in foreign waters. However, we need not further burden this already lengthy opinion by 
additional discussion of this point, other than to point it out, especially since it loses its otherwise important significance when we 
assume, infra, the facts as to market shares to be as favorable as possible to the government."
934,7," An additional reason causing us to suspect the reliability of the government's figures is the fact that, although, as noted above, 
we agree with the government's concept of the relevant product market as we there defined the boats constituting that market, "
935,," which was largely based on the ""Bright Lecture,"" it appears from the evidence herein that a borderline area exists between crew 
boats and utility boats in which it is difficult to distinguish one from the other.  This indicates that there is a lack of universal 
agreement in the industry as to what constitutes a crew boat and what constitutes a utility boat. This area where the greatest 
difference of opinion exists apparently involves large high-powered boats with planing hulls.  It is uncertain from the 
government's evidence whether the information obtained as a result of the telephone survey was based on the definition of 
supply and utility boats which the government advanced and which we adopted.  It is imperative that the persons responding to 
the survey correctly understood what the government meant by its terms.  Yet, it may well be that many of those persons 
contacted by the government stated that they owned ""utility"" boats which, by definition, were ""crew"" boats."
935,8," Pursuant to the information contained in O'Connell's affidavit, we took 7% of the figures in 2(a) and 2(c) of the exhibit attached 
to his affidavit and added to that figure the number indicated in 2(d) and 2(f).  In making this calculation, we obviously excluded 
2(e). "
936,9," However, by no means does this give rise to an inference that Tidewater and Twenty Grand own only 7.8% of the supply and 
utility boats actually chartered in the Gulf of Mexico.  Nor have the defendants advanced this argument.  In fact, by Tidewater's 
own admission, it alone has 48 supply and utility boats operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which is over 9.7% of the total 493 
claimed by the defendants for the Gulf of Mexico."
936,10," The government's attempt to soften the damaging effect of this evidence failed.  The government pointed out, through the 
testimony of Deutschmann, that defendants' Exhibit A contains the names of persons and firms who actually own the boats and 
that only about 10% of these owners are actually engaged in chartering the boats. The remainder of the owners do not charter 
their own boats but provide their boats to firms which do charter them.  The government then declared that its Exhibit 2B is 
based on the number of boats a firm has available for charter rather than the number the firm actually owns because this more 
accurately reveals the true competitive situation.  Thus, the government concluded, the additional 90 owners and 107 boats 
advanced by the defendants are irrelevant since these owners and boats are already encompassed in the government's 
tabulation (except for the 10% who do charter boats for themselves).  However, the defendants proved that the government's 
tabulation failed to accurately reflect the number of boats which firms do have available for charter (see footnote 11 and 
accompanying text), and thus we can only conclude that the government's tabulation must have been based largely on 
ownership.  This conclusion is fortified by an examination of the interview form and the confirmation letter used in the 
government survey, both of which refer to ""ownership."" Thus, the defendants' Exhibit A possesses considerable significance."
936,11," The defendants' evidence in this respect was produced by notarized affidavits of the owners or officers of some of the firms.  
The affidavits are not in conflict with the confirmation letters received by the government from these persons because the 
government's letters referred to ""ownership"" by the particular corporation, whereas the defendants focused on boats available to 
the particular corporation and thus included boats owned by subsidiary and affiliated corporations.  However, even if they were 
contradictory, we would accept as true the information contained in the affidavits which, unlike the confirmation letters, was filed 
under oath.  These affidavits clearly show that the government's Exhibit 2B is misleading as to the true competitive situation. "
938,12," These affidavits are distinguishable from the competitors' testimony in Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 366, 367, n. 43, 
which was largely discarded by the Supreme Court.  The testimony in that case concerned the competitors' opinions as to the 
vigor of future competition after the merger. The affidavits here, however, are directed to the effect of the merger on the affiants' 
own businesses.  Here, unlike Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, the competitors are speaking on that which they are most qualified to 
speak.  Further, also unlike Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, the competitors here gave concrete reasons to support their statements."
938,13," The government apparently sensed the futility of such questioning for it candidly admitted on page 4, footnote 1, of the 
Sheppard affidavit that it quit asking this question as the survey progressed. "
939,14," If we assume, arguendo, that Tidewater and Twenty Grand did not have to fear being supplanted by their numerous 
competitors and could engage in oppressive practices forcing the oil companies to construct their own boats rather than charter, 
then it may be that this fact, that is, forcing the customers to invest in boats when it is more profitable for them to charter, would 
be a serious anticompetitive effect.  Such a suggestion, however, answers itself for the defendants' own economic interest will 
prevent them from doing that which would destroy their own business."
939,15," Parenthetically, we might note that advertising, which flourishes with size, is not a ""major competitive weapon"" in this industry 
as it was in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 87 S. Ct. 1224 (1967). We should 
also note, though, that a few government affidavits obtained from competitors of Tidewater and Twenty Grand stated that size 
does benefit a chartering firm in one respect in that it enables the large firm to replace a vessel which becomes disabled with 
another one.  However, we do not know how often boats break down on the job and are unable to assess the significance, if 
any, of this factor.  Further, it would not seem feasible to take a boat off of one job to replace a disabled boat on another job, nor 
would it appear profitable to maintain an idle fleet of boats in order to replace those which do break down.  Finally, this factor, if 
true, appears without significance from the fact that the larger firms are already endowed with this ""advantage,"" yet it has not 
dampened the flourishing competition from the small firms.  Since this factor has not noticeably influenced the customers' choice 
in this market, the ""advantage"" it affords, if any, lacks any anticompetitive effect. "
941,16," One court, however, apparently takes a different view.  United States v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 240 F. Supp. 867, 
955 (S.D.N.Y. 1965). Relying on United States v. First Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. of Lexington, 376 U.S. 665, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1, 84 S. 
Ct. 1033 (1964), the court there held that the elimination of substantial competition between the merged banks did in and of 
itself, and without regard to the pertinent economic factors of the relevant market, constitute a violation of ยง 7 of the Clayton Act. 
We do not agree with that view.  The Lexington case involved the Sherman Act, and we are unwilling to extend that holding to 
the Clayton Act, especially when four of the justices in that case refused to ascribe to the majority holding.  In addition, the 
Lexington case, as with all antitrust cases, turned on its own particular facts.  See Winn Ave. Warehouse, Inc. v. Winchester 
Tobacco Ware. Co., 341 F.2d 287 (6th Cir. 1965). In that case it was clear from the market structure that the consolidation would 
seriously impede the ability of the remaining banks to compete. We feel justified in our opinion in view of the number of decisions 
applying ยง 7 of the Clayton Act subsequent to the Lexington case in none of which did the Supreme Court even mention the 
Lexington case.  These decisions, the benefit of many of which was unavailable to the court in Manufacturers Hanover, leave 
undisturbed the principle quoted in Brown Shoe, supra, and, in fact, reaffirm that decision.  Those decisions are: Federal Trade 
Comm'n v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 87 S. Ct. 1224 (1967); United States v. First City Nat'l Bank 
of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 18 L. Ed. 2d 151, 87 S. Ct. 1088 (1967) (this case did cite the Lexington case at 367 but for a totally 
unrelated principle); United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 16 L. Ed. 2d 765, 86 S. Ct. 1665 (1966); United States v.

ended any fraudulent concealment. Since, by virtue of the tolling effect, all class members are within the statutory time period 
unless individual knowledge prior to the indictment date is shown, no absentee plaintiff is prejudiced by the assumption

court deems this question immaterial and holds that if there is any merit to this objection at all, it is obviated by the fact that 
clearly the counties will qualify as members of the class represented in the South Dakota action.  If counsel desires to propose

protect their registered trade and service marks, but because they had failed to answer interrogatories pertinent to this defense, 
the district judge ordered it stricken, without prejudice to renewal if respondents promptly answered the relevant interrogatories.  
Because of its disposition of the case, the Court of Appeals reached neither the merits of this defense nor the question whether 
respondents had ever properly renewed it.  In the circumstances of this case, we think the merits of this defense cannot be 
decided as a summary judgment question but must be resolved, along with all the other issues, by a trial on the merits. "

could do more than mitigate very slightly the losses that a dealer would suffer when forced to buy higher-priced Midas products,

requesting that the District Court certify the question of construction to Judge Wyzanski.  United contends that the District Court

1017,2," ""4. All leases made by defendant which include either a ten-year term, or a full capacity clause, or deferred payment charges, 
and all leases under which during the life of the leases defendant has rendered repair and other service without making them 
subject to separate, segregated charges, are declared to have been means whereby defendant monopolized the shoe 
machinery market.""  110 F.Supp., at 352."
1017,3," In its opinion on remedy, in answering United's objection to its conclusion that the decree should require United to offer 
machines for sale as well as for lease, the court plainly said that United ""has used its leases to monopolize the shoe machinery 
market.  And if leasing continues without an alternative sales system, United will still be able to monopolize that market.""  110 
F.Supp., at 350. Clearly, if after purging the leases of objectionable clauses United would still be monopolizing by leasing but not 
selling its machines, the lease only policy must also have made a substantial contribution to United's monopolization of the 
market during the period prior to the entry of the judgment.  Moreover, in its opinion on violation, where the three principal 
sources of United's market power were identified, the court pointed to ""the magnetic ties inherent in its system of leasing, and 
not selling, its more important machines"" and to the ""'partnership'"" aspects of leasing but not selling those machines.  110 
F.Supp., at 344. The leases assured ""closer and more frequent contacts between United and its customers than would exist if 
United were a seller and its customers were buyers.""  Id., at 343. A shoe manufacturer by leasing was ""deterred more than if he 
owned that same United machine, or if he held it on a short lease carrying simple rental provisions and a reasonable charge for 
cancelation before the end of the term.""  Id., at 340. The lease system had ""aided United in maintaining a pricing system which 
discriminates between machine types,""  id., at 344, discrimination which the court later said had evidenced ""United's monopoly 
power, a buttress to it, and a cause of its perpetuation . . . .""  Id., at 349."
1017,4," In its brief on appeal from the judgment and decree rendered in the Government's case, United recognized that ""the principal

for sale and that defendant serviced the leased machines without a separate charge."" Brief for Appellant 6, United Shoe "

1018,5," The Court of Appeals affirmed this finding and we do not disturb it.  See also n. 16, infra.  We also agree with the courts below 
that in the circumstances of this case it was unnecessary for Hanover to prove an explicit demand during the damage period.  
See Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699 (1962)."
1018,6," The chronology of events with respect to this issue in the lower courts was as follows: After the pretrial conference, a separate 
issue which was thought might determine the action was set for trial pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42 (b).  The general 
question was whether, assuming that Hanover had paid illegally high prices for machinery leased from United, Hanover had 
passed the cost on to its customers, and if so whether it had suffered legal injury for which it could recover under the antitrust 
laws. After evidence had been taken on the issue, Judge Goodrich, sitting by designation, ruled that when Hanover had been 
forced to pay excessive prices for machinery leased from United, it had suffered a legal injury: ""This excessive price is the 
injury.""  185 F.Supp. 826, 829 (D. C. M. D. Pa. 1960). He also rejected the argument ""that the defendant is relieved of liability 
because the plaintiff passed on its loss to its customers."" Ibid.  In his view it was unnecessary to determine whether Hanover had 
passed on the illegal burden because Hanover's injury was complete when it paid the excessive rentals and because ""'the 
general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step'"" and to exonerate a defendant by 
reason of remote consequences.   Id., at 830 (quoting from Southern Pacific Co. v.  Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531, 
533 (1918)). The Court of Appeals heard an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 1292 (b) and affirmed.   281 F.2d 481 
(C. A. 3d Cir. 1960). Certiorari was denied.   364 U.S. 901 (1960). United preserved the issue and presented it again to the Court 
of Appeals in appealing the treble-damage judgment entered after trial of the main case.  The Court of Appeals adhered to the 
principles of its prior decision.  United brought the question here. "
1019,7," ""It is, however, contended that even if it be assumed the facts show an illegal combination, they do not show injury to the 
plaintiffs by reason thereof.  The contention is untenable.  Section 7 of the act gives a cause of action to any person injured in 
his person or property by reason of anything forbidden by the act and the right to recover three-fold the damages by him 
sustained.  The plaintiffs alleged a charge over a reasonable rate and the amount of it.  If the charge be true that more than a 
reasonable rate was secured by the combination, the excess over what was reasonable was an element of injury.  Texas & 
Pacific Ry. Co. v.  Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 436. The unreasonableness of the rate and to what extent 
unreasonable was submitted to the jury and the verdict represented their conclusion.""  243 U.S., at 88."
1019,8," Southern Pacific Co. v.  Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531 (1918), involved an action for reparations brought by 
shippers against a railroad.  The shippers alleged exaction of an unreasonably high rate.  To the claim that the shippers should 
not recover because they were able to pass on to their customers the damage they sustained by paying the charge, the Court 
said that the answer was not difficult: ""The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.  As it does not attribute 
remote consequences to a defendant so it holds him liable if proximately the plaintiff has suffered a loss.  The plaintiffs suffered 
losses to the amount of the verdict when they paid.  Their claim accrued at once in the theory of the law and it does not inquire 
into later events. . . .  The carrier ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is 
the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum. . . .  Probably in the end the public pays the 
damages in most cases of compensated torts.""  245 U.S., at 533-534.  Adams v. Mills, 286 U.S. 397 (1932), is to the same 
effect.  See also I. C. C. v.  United States, 289 U.S. 385 (1933). Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 260 U.S. 156 (1922), is relied upon by United as stating a contrary rule.  There the Court 
affirmed a judgment on the pleadings in a shipper's action under the antitrust laws charging a conspiracy among railroads to set 
unreasonably high rates.  Because the rates had been approved as reasonable after a proceeding before the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, the shipper was held to have no cause of action under the antitrust laws. After giving this and other 
reasons for its judgment, the Court ended its opinion by saying that it would have been impossible for the shipper to have proved 
damages since no court could say that if the rate had been lower the shipper would have enjoyed the difference; the benefit 
might have gone to his customers. The Court, however, was careful to say earlier in its opinion that the result would have been 
different had the rate been unreasonably high, an approach confirmed by Mr. Justice Brandeis in  Adams v. Mills, supra. We 
ascribe no general significance to the Keogh dictum for cases where the plaintiff is free to prove that he has been charged an 
illegally high price.  It should also be noted that the Court, in speaking of the impossibility of proving damages, indicated no 
intention to preclude recovery in cases such as Chattanooga Foundry or  Thomsen v. Cayser, supra. That is where the matter stood in this Court when the issue came to be pressed with some regularity in the lower federal courts 
in treble-damage suits brought by customers of vendors who were charged with violating the Sherman Act by price fixing or 
monopolization. Some courts sustained the defense, both where the plaintiff complained of overcharging for materials or 
services used by him to produce his own product, e. g.,  Wolfe v. National Lead Co., 225 F.2d 427 (C. A. 9th Cir.), cert. denied,  
350 U.S. 915 (1955), and where the price fixing concerned articles purchased for resale, e. g., Miller Motors, Inc. v.  Ford Motor 
Co., 252 F.2d 441 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1958); Twin Ports Oil Co. v.  Pure Oil Co., 119 F.2d 747 (C. A. 8th Cir.), cert. denied,  314 U.S. 
644 (1941). Others, beginning with Judge Goodrich's 1960 decision in the case before us, deemed it irrelevant that the plaintiff 
may have passed on the burden of the overcharge. Recently, for example, the defense was rejected in the cases brought 
against manufacturers of electrical equipment by local utilities who purchased equipment at unlawfully inflated prices and used it "
1020,," to produce electricity sold to the ultimate consumer.  E. g., Atlantic City Electric Co. v.  General Electric Co., 226 F.Supp. 59 (D. 
C. S. D. N. Y.), interlocutory appeal refused,  337 F.2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1964). Concerning the passing-on defense generally, see Clark, The Treble Damage Bonanza: New Doctrines of Damages in Private 
Antitrust Suits,  52 Mich. L. Rev. 363 (1954); Pollock, Standing to Sue, Remoteness of Injury, and the Passing-On Doctrine, 32 
A. B. A. Antitrust L. J. 5 (1966); Note, Private Treble Damage Antitrust Suits: Measure of Damages for Destruction of All or Part 
of a Business,  80 Harv. L. Rev. 1566, 1584-1586 (1967)."
1020,9," The mere fact that a price rise followed an unlawful cost increase does not show that the sufferer of the cost increase was 
undamaged.  His customers may have been ripe for his price rise earlier; if a cost rise is merely the occasion for a price increase 
a businessman could have imposed absent the rise in his costs, the fact that he was earlier not enjoying the benefits of the 
higher price should not permit the supplier who charges an unlawful price to take those benefits from him without being liable for 
damages.  This statement merely recognizes the usual principle that the possessor of a right can recover for its unlawful 
deprivation whether or not he was previously exercising it. "
1021,10," Some courts appear to have treated price discrimination cases under the Robinson-Patman Act as in this category.  See, e. g., 
American Can Co. v.  Russellville Canning Co., 191 F.2d 38 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1951); American Can Co. v.  Bruce's Juices, 187 
F.2d 919, opinion modified,  190 F.2d 73 (C. A. 5th Cir.), petition for cert. dismissed,  342 U.S. 875 (1951)."
1021,11," The Court of Appeals held that Hanover was entitled to damages only up to June 1, 1955, the date upon which Judge 
Wyzanski approved United's plan for terminating all outstanding leases and converting the lessee's rights to ownership.  
Because Hanover could have legally required United to convert from leasing to selling as of June 1, 1955, the Court of Appeals 
held it was not entitled to damages for United's failure to offer machines for sale after that date.  This determination has not been 
challenged in this Court. "
1022,12," Although the defendants in American Tobacco had been found guilty of conspiracy to restrain trade and of attempt and 
conspiracy to monopolize as well as of monopolization itself, the grant of certiorari was ""limited to the question whether actual 
exclusion of competitors is necessary to the crime of monopolization under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act.""  324 U.S. 836 (1945). After 
noting that ""ยงยง 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act require proof of conspiracies which are reciprocally distinguishable from and 
independent of each other . . . ,""  328 U.S., at 788, the Court determined that the jury could have found that the defendants had 
combined and conspired to monopolize,  id., at 797, and that it would be ""only in conjunction with such a combination or 
conspiracy that these cases will constitute a precedent,""  id., at 798. The Court stated that ""the authorities support the view that 
the material consideration in determining whether a monopoly exists is not that prices are raised and that competition actually is 
excluded but that power exists to raise prices or to exclude competition when it is desired to do so,""  328 U.S., at 811 (emphasis 
added), and quoted with approval from  United States v. Patten, 187 F. 664, 672 (C. C. S. D. N. Y. (1911)), reversed on other 
grounds,  226 U.S. 525 (1913), that for there to be monopolization ""it is not necessary that the power thus obtained should be 
exercised.  Its existence is sufficient."" The Court also said: ""A correct interpretation of the statute and of the authorities makes it the crime of monopolizing, under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act, 
for parties, as in these cases, to combine or conspire to acquire or maintain the power to exclude competitors from any part of 
the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, provided they also have such a power that they are 
able, as a group, to exclude actual or potential competition from the field and provided that they have the intent and purpose to 
exercise that power.  See  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 226, n. 59 and authorities cited. ""It is not the form of the combination or the particular means used but the result to be achieved that the statute condemns.  It is 
not of importance whether the means used to accomplish the unlawful objective are in themselves lawful or unlawful.""  328 U.S., 
at 809. (Emphasis added.) The Court also welcomed the opportunity to endorse,  328 U.S., at 813-814, the following views of Chief Judge Hand in  Alcoa, 
148 F.2d., at 431-432: ""[Alcoa] insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace 
each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, 
having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel.  Only in case we interpret 'exclusion' as 
limited to manoeuvres not honestly industrial, but actuated solely by a desire to prevent competition, can such a course, 
indefatigably pursued, be deemed not 'exclusionary.' So to limit it would in our judgment emasculate the Act; would permit just 
such consolidations as it was designed to prevent. . . . . ""In order to fall within ยง 2, the monopolist must have both the power to monopolize, and the intent to monopolize. To read the 
passage as demanding any 'specific,' intent, makes nonsense of it, for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is 
doing."""
1022,13," Any view of the earlier law of monopolization which would attempt, erroneously in our opinion, to find a requirement of 
predatory practices must rely heavily on certain dicta in  United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417, 451 (1920) 
(Mr. Justice McKenna for a four-to-three Court), and  United States v. International Harvester Co., 274 U.S. 693, 708 (1927) (Mr. 
Justice Sanford reiterating the dicta in U.S. Steel).  The commentators cited by United for the proposition that predatory 
practices were required prior to Alcoa-American Tobacco place major reliance on these dicta.  In any event, the cursory and 
conclusory nature of these writings clearly does not provide sufficiently strong proof of a prevailing opinion as to the law to have 
permitted the sort of justifiable reliance which alone could generate a prospectivity argument. "
1023,14," United makes the independent argument that Judge Wyzanski's decision in the Government's case so fundamentally altered 
the law of monopolization that it should not be held liable for damages prior to the date the decision was handed down, February 
18, 1953.  We reject this contention for the reasons set forth in the textual discussion of Alcoa-American Tobacco and the 
previous United cases. "
1024,15," United has also advanced the argument that because the earliest impact on Hanover of United's lease only policy occurred in 
1912, Hanover's cause of action arose during that year and is now barred by the applicable Pennsylvania statute of limitations.  
The Court of Appeals correctly rejected United's argument in its supplemental opinion.  We are not dealing with a violation 
which, if it occurs at all, must occur within some specific and limited time span.  Cf. Emich Motors Corp. v.  General Motors 
Corp., 229 F.2d 714 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1956), upon which United relies.  Rather, we are dealing with conduct which constituted a 
continuing violation of the Sherman Act and which inflicted continuing and accumulating harm on Hanover.  Although Hanover 
could have sued in 1912 for the injury then being inflicted, it was equally entitled to sue in 1955. "
1025,16," United also says that because Hanover's managers would have computed their capital costs differently, they would not in fact 
have decided to stop leasing machines and to begin purchasing them.  The District Court found, however, that Hanover, had it 
been given the opportunity, would have bought rather than leased the machines offered by United.  This finding, affirmed by the 
Court of Appeals, is supported by the evidence, and we do not disturb it. "
1028,1," I am not alone in this view.  See  Cole v. Hughes Tool Co., 215 F.2d 924, 932-933; Laitram Corp. v.  King Crab, Inc., 244 
F.Supp. 9, 18. See also n. 2, infra. "
1029,2," Neither, apparently, could Judge Wyzanski.  After the trial court in this action filed its opinion holding that the 1953 decree had 
condemned United's lease-only practice, United applied to Judge Wyzanski for a construction of his decree. While denying the 
application upon grounds of comity, Judge Wyzanski indicated a willingness to construe his decree if officially requested by the 
trial judge in the present case, Judge Sheridan.  During the course of the hearing before Judge Wyzanski, he made his own 
views clear to government counsel: ""Now that you are here, are you not aware from being here on previous occasions that the government never contended, and I 
never ruled, as Judge Sheridan supposes the matter was decided?"""
1029,3," 110 F.Supp., at 349-350. The language quoted by the Court, ante, at 486, n. 3, is not a statement of why the District Court in 
1953 ordered United to offer its machines for sale, but rather part of the court's answer to United's argument that it would be 
unfair to make United sell while its competitors continued only to lease.  110 F.Supp., at 350."
1029,4," ""When the applicable standard for determining monopolization under ยง 2 is applied to these facts, it must be concluded that the 
District Court and the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that United's practice of leasing and refusing to sell its major 
machines was determined to be illegal monopolization in the Government's case."" (Emphasis added.) "
1038,1," Besides certificating the construction and operation of the Great Lakes facilities, the Commission issued certificates of public 
convenience and necessity for construction and operation of facilities to Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Michigan 
Wisconsin Pipe Line Company, authorized the transportation, sale, importation and exportation above described, and issued "
1039,," Presidential Permits for the border connections.  The requested authorizations are contained in interdependent applications of 
Great Lakes, Michigan Wisconsin, and Midwestern. These actions are required by ยง 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 717f(c) (1964 ed.): ""No natural-gas company * * * shall engage in the transportation or sale of natural gas * * * or undertake the construction or 
extension of any facilities therefor, or acquire or operate any such facilities or extensions thereof, unless there is in force 
with respect to such natural-gas company a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Commission

1039,3," Just last year the Supreme Court summarized the responsibility of the regulatory agencies in this regard: ""* * * Both the ICC and this Court have read terms such as 'public interest' broadly, to require consideration of all important 
consequences including anticompetitive effects.  Thus the ICC is required to weigh anticompetitive effects in approving 
applications for merger or control under ยง 5 of the Act, authorizing the ICC to grant such applications only if 'consistent with 
the public interest.' McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67 [88 L. Ed. 544, 64 S. Ct. 370]. And similarly broad 
responsibilities are encompassed within like broad directives addressed to other agencies.  E.g., National Broadcasting Co. 
v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 224 [87 L. Ed. 1344, 63 S. Ct. 997]; FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 94 [97

1040,4," See Symposium on Regulated Industries and Antitrust, 32 A.B.A. Antitrust L.J. 215 (1966). Much of this debate seems to 
center on the objection of practicing lawyers to dealing with two heads of United States agencies on a single problem.  That is, 
they complain that there are unnecessary complications when an antitrust question arises in a regulated industry because it 
often requires them to deal with not only the relevant regulatory agency but also the Department of Justice.  It appears that this 
problem could be alleviated if the regulatory agencies were conscientiously to examine the antitrust implications of their actions, 
thereby taking much of the burden from the Department of Justice.  This may have been one of the objectives of the recent

producing areas, an extensive pulp and paper industry and public and privately-owned power generating plants, and that Trans-
Canada estimated that the gas sold in the United States would produce revenues of more than $23,000,000 a year. The Commission found that by the fifth year of operation (1970-71) the certificated Great Lakes pipeline, which is essentially the 
same as the one proposed originally, would carry approximately 734,000 Mcf/day, and be capable of carrying an additional 
86,000 Mcf/day merely by increasing the compression of the system.  It further found that by the fifth year of operation 
approximately 224,000 M2cf/year (about 612,000 Mcf/day) would be transported to eastern Canada.  Therefore, approximately 
248,000 Mcf/day, or 30 per cent of the capacity of the system, would be available for marketing in the United States."
1044,15," Professor Brodley has criticized this mode of analysis as being too dependent on subjective factors and has argued that a

Rev. 285, 335 (1967). "

1045,19," Professors Kaysen and Turner defined a natural monopoly as follows: ""In the economic sense, natural monopoly is monopoly resulting from economies of scale * * * such that one firm of efficient 
size can produce all or more than the market can take at a remunerative price, and can continually expand its capacity at 
less cost than that of a new firm entering the business."" C. Kaysen & D. Turner, Antitrust Policy 191 (1959)."
1045,20," A tight oligopoly market is one which is highly concentrated and which has been defined as a market in which eight or fewer 
firms supply over 50 per cent of the market, with the largest firm at least 20 per cent.  A partial monopoly is defined as a market 
in which one supplier controls 60 per cent of the market and no other single seller has a significant proportion.  C. Kaysen & D. 
Turner, supra Note 19, at 72.  As noted earlier, American Natural supplies over 50 per cent of the Wisconsin and Michigan "
1046,," markets.  Two other suppliers compete with American Natural in lower Michigan, and Northern competes with it in a small corner 
of northern Michigan."
1046,21," Because the number of competitors is so small and because the demand is generally inelastic, one seller cannot significantly 
increase his market share without causing a significant decrease in the market shares held by his competitors. See Brodley,

game, etc.  The combinatorial complications of the problem . . . increase tremendously with every increase in the number of

1047,26," HN13[
] The Commission has the power to maximize the effectiveness of limited competition by specifying the service area in which the certified pipeline may compete. See ยง 7(e)(f) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 717f(e)(f) (1964 ed.)."
1047,27," It seems that competition would be more likely to develop sooner here than in the taconite region because it is a virgin market 
which a wholly-owned Trans-Canada subsidiary could seek immediately without waiting for the expiration of long-term contracts 
which encumber the taconite market.  The development of this northern Michigan market was a factor which contributed to the 
Commission's conclusion that the route of the joint venture pipeline was more in the public interest than was the proposal of the 
petitioners."
1047,28," American Natural is not utilizing excess capacity or making possible other economies of scale.  It is merely paying one-half the 
cost of the new line.  In fact, American Natural may be sacrificing economies of scale in order to protect its market from an 
independent competitor. See ยง 1, C, 2 of text, infra.  Although the certifications granted by the Commission would result in 
Midwestern's utilizing some of its excess capacity to bring Canadian gas to the Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company, this 
was technically unrelated to the joint venture project after the second year. If on remand Michigan Wisconsin and Midwestern choose to file their original proposal and Great Lakes again files an 
independent application, the Commission may find it necessary to weigh, along with other factors, the advantages of the limited 
competition offered by an independent Great Lakes against the economies of scale which Michigan Wisconsin and Midwestern 
might be able to demonstrate.  A recent opinion of the Supreme Court indicates that the former is entitled to substantial weight.  
See Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 141-142, 17 L. Ed. 2d 814, 87 S. Ct. 932 (1967), 
wherein the Court overturned the District Court divestiture decree ordered in United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 
651, 662, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12, 84 S. Ct. 1044 (1964), thereby indicating its preference for some overlapping facilities in order to 
obtain meaningful competition between the parent company and the divested company."
1047,29," El Paso sought to accomplish the merger by purchasing the stock of Pacific Northwest and later acquiring the assets.  After 
the Department of Justice had challenged the stock acquisition, El Paso sought to immunize the merger from ยง 7 of the Clayton 
Act by obtaining the approval of the Power Commission for the asset transfer and arguing that the proviso in ยง 7 was intended to 
preclude the Department of Justice from attacking a merger receiving the approval of the Commission.  The Supreme Court 
rejected this argument. California v. F.P.C., supra Note 10.  The effect of the proviso need not be considered here as this case 
only raises the question what the Commission must examine before approving an acquisition, not the question what significance 
this approval has. "
1048,30," In such a market, the entry of the joint venture would actually decrease market concentration.  Contrast the instant case, 
where the joint venture increases American Natural's share of the market and thereby decreases market competition."
1048,31," After remand to the District Court for a determination of this question, the District Court found that neither participant in the 
joint venture would have entered the market by itself and, therefore, again gave judgment to the defendants.  The Department of 
Justice has again appealed to the Supreme Court. Affirmed, 389 U.S. 308, 88 S. Ct. 502, 19 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1967)."
1048,32," See generally Brodley, supra Note 15, 19 Stan. L. Rev. 329-337. After recognizing that some joint ventures may be in the 
public interest for a variety of reasons, id. at 333, none of which are applicable to this case, Professor Brodley comments: ""* * * Thus, to suggest the scope of the problem, if (1) the parents' market is highly concentrated, (2) at least one of the 
parents has a significant market share, and (3) the joint venture is horizontal, then any supposed advantage from the 
increase in the number of competitors in the market as a result of the joint venture seems wholly illusory.  Indeed, the most 
probable result of the formation of the joint venture would be to add to the already excessive market share of the parent or 
parents.  It must be assumed that parent and progeny will not compete, but will work together to extract a joint maximum 
return from the market they influence together."" Id. at 335. "
1049,33," But see Pennsylvania Water & Power Co. v. F.P.C., 89 U.S. App. D.C. 235, 193 F.2d 230 (1951), affirmed, 343 U.S. 414, 96 
L. Ed. 1042, 72 S. Ct. 843 (1952), where a divided panel of this court affirmed a Commission proceeding approving certain rates 
even though foundation contracts upon which the rates depended had previously been found to be in violation of the antitrust 
laws. The majority there concluded: ""* * * But where a statute provides for comprehensive and detailed regulation of a particular industry, as to the Interstate 
Commerce Act * * * and the Federal Power Act, there is, as we have indicated, only a limited area for application of antitrust 
considerations to Commission decisions."" 89 U.S. App. D.C. at 240, 193 F.2d at 235.  The underlying rationale of this case seems to have been eroded by subsequent decisions in this court and in the Supreme 
Court and, therefore, does not appear to be controlling.  See, e.g., F.M.C. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, supra 
Note 10; California v. F.P.C., supra Note 10.  Furthermore, within a few months of the decision in Pennsylvania Water & Power, 
the Fourth Circuit considered a related case and rejected the above reasoning.  Consolidated Gas Electric Light & Power Co. v. 
Pennsylvania Water & Power Co., 4 Cir., 194 F.2d 89, cert. denied, 343 U.S. 963, 72 S. Ct. 1056, 96 L. Ed. 1360 (1952). See

Finally, even in Pennsylvania Water & Power the court recognized that ""regulated industries are not per se exempt from the 
antitrust laws and repeals by implication are not favored,"" and therefore the court only said that ""the antitrust laws are 
superseded by more specific regulatory statutes to the extent of the repugnancy between them."" 89 U.S. App. D.C. at 240, 193 
F.2d at 235. For the reasons already set out, we believe that to a large degree the objectives of the Natural Gas Act and antitrust 
laws are not repugnant but rather complementary. "
1050,34," 113,000 Mcf of gas per day was to be purchased by Michigan Wisconsin from Midwestern, which in turn purchased an 
additional 113,000 from Trans-Canada.  Michigan Consolidated agreed to take 57,000 Mcf of gas per day from Great Lakes, 
whose gas was also supplied by Trans-Canada."
1050,35," One of the main purposes of tying this sale -purchase into this proceeding seems to have been to avoid a Commission 
rejection of the Great Lakes project because Midwestern's excess capacity was not being utilized. "

Ohio L.J. 439, 441 (1965)."
1052,39," The temptation to apply this type of pressure is made obvious by the following testimony of Ray J. Lynch, vice president of 
Michigan Wisconsin: ""We know that each day gas is getting tighter here in the States * * *.  And we feel very strongly that the long-range gas 
supply for our area, and, indeed, for many areas in the U.S. will be Western Canadian gas.  And we want to be there to 
protect ourselves, and our customers."" "
1053,40," The Commission noted this duty in its brief and gave partial recognition to it in its opinion by considering the merits of the staff 
proposal."
1053,41," This S.E.C. approval conceivably may prohibit the courts from ever determining if this joint venture violates ยง 7 of the Clayton 
Act. The proviso to ยง 7 states: ""Nothing contained in this section shall apply to transactions duly consummated pursuant to 
authority given by the * * * Federal Power Commission, * * * the Securities and Exchange Commission in the exercise of its 
jurisdiction under section 79j [the Public Utilities Holding Company Act], * * * or the Secretary of Agriculture * * *."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 18 
(1964 ed.).  Although none of the parties attempted to do so, it is possible to argue that if the Power Commission denied the joint 
venture application on the basis of policy underlying the broad prohibition of ยง 7 of the Clayton Act, then the Commission would 
be frustrating the policy of the proviso.  That is, if the Department of Justice could not attack the joint venture on the basis of ยง 7, 
after the S.E.C. approved it, how can the Power Commission utilize ยง 7 for defining public policy? In the first place it is far from clear that the approval of the S.E.C. would immunize the joint venture from a ยง 7 violation since this 
proviso has been restrictively interpreted in favor of the broader policy of ยง 7. California v. F.P.C., supra Note 10 (Power 
Commission approval of acquisition does not immunize agreement from pending Justice Department antitrust suit); cf. Maryland 
& Virginia Milk Producers Ass'n v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 4 L. Ed. 2d 880, 80 S. Ct. 847 (1960) (acquisition is not immune 
from antitrust suit since authority of Secretary of Agriculture to approve marketing arrangements is narrowly construed).  
Secondly, even if the S.E.C. approval of American Natural's acquisition of the Great Lakes stock prevented the courts from 
finding American Natural in violation of ยง 7 of the Clayton Act, neither statutory language nor policy would prohibit the Power 
Commission from relying on ยง 7 policy in determining the public interest. The Power Commission is obliged to take those steps 
most likely to accomplish an efficient allocation of natural gas resources and give consumers better service at a lower price.  To 
find that prior approval by the S.E.C. precludes the Power Commission from relying on the general policy underlying ยง 7 would 
permit the limited exception to ยง 7 to not only frustrate the broader ยง 7 prohibition but also the broader policy of the Natural Gas 
Act. "
1054,42," The staff of the Commission, while recognizing many other drawbacks to petitioners' proposal, concluded: ""Northern Natural, by including in its application a means whereby its customers could profit through an avoidance of 
construction costs, has injected that single instance in the combined applications which contemplates a positive benefit to 
United States consumers. * * *"""
1054,43," The Commission contends that it would be fallacious reasoning to recognize this saving because ""the Commission * * * would 
be burdened with the impossible task of determining to what service or customers the cost of any particular new facility should 
be attributed."" We reject this contention.  First, petitioners' claimed savings do not require such an allocation; rather, they merely 
ask the Commission to recognize a total saving, irrespective of whether it is enjoyed by the customers of Northern or Northern 
Transportation.  Second, the ""impossible task"" of allocating the costs of a common service between petitioners is precisely what 
the Commission performed to defeat petitioners' proposals."
1054,44," The staff prefaced its adjustments with this statement: ""* * * These adjustments were made only where the record fully supported the new figures.  When certain cost estimates 
were the subject of contradictory statements, as between those of witnesses for Great Lakes and those of Northern Natural, 
the staff utilized the Great Lakes figures. * * *"" "

1067,3," On the record presented we are unable to evaluate the motions to dismiss granted by the trial court as to various defendants.  
Our examination of the record available persuades us that in major part the motions were granted on the ground that plaintiffs 
had consistently failed to allege factual matters with the particularity required to sustain a cause of action under the Cartwright 
Act and other acts on which plaintiffs relied.  Accordingly, motions to dismiss all or portions of plaintiffs' fourth amended 
complaint were granted as to various defendants on grounds which appear to be related to those for sustaining the general 
demurrers. Although the instant record does not fully advise us of matters identical to those in Lavine v. Jessup (1957) 48 Cal.2d 
611 [311 P.2d 8], plaintiffs assert that a ""duplicate situation"" exists.  The following observations from that case are pertinent 
here: ""This case presents an unusual situation in that the court simultaneously sustained general demurrers without leave to 
amend and granted motions to strike the complaint as sham and to dismiss the action.  The motions were not supported by 
affidavits setting up any extrinsic matters and obviously were made upon the assumption that the complaint failed to state a 
cause of action and was merely repetitious of prior complaints which had been ruled insufficient.  Defendants thus made their 
challenge solely on the fact of the pleadings, and it seems clear that the questions presented by the motions were identically the 
same as those presented by the demurrers, i.e., did the complaint state a cause of action and, if not, could the defects be cured 
by amendment.  The normal method of resolving such issues in favor of a defendant is by ruling upon a demurrer and thereafter 
rendering a judgment based upon the ruling.  It is, of course, unnecessary for the court, in addition, to grant a motion to dismiss.  
As we have seen, the court subsequently signed and filed a judgment of dismissal which, after reciting that the demurrers had 
been sustained and the motions had been granted, adjudged that the action be dismissed."" (48 Cal.2d at p. 614.) As indicated, 
the court equated the Lavine order granting the motion to dismiss with the order sustaining the general demurrer. [For the foregoing reasons we do not pass upon the merits of the motions to dismiss or the propriety of the orders thereon as 
raising independent issues.] "

sufficient to state the purpose or effects of the trust or combination, and that the accused is a member of, acted with, or in 
pursuance of it, or aided or assisted in carrying out its purposes, without giving its name or description, or how, when and where 
it was created."" "

1092,2," Because the Court has concluded that the Federal Trade Commission Docket 8435 was not a proceeding to enforce the anti-

competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them . . . . The plaintiff's pre-trial memorandum, filed some three-and-a-half years after his complaint, alleges violations of 15 U.S.C. Secs.

1111,18, The following colloquy took place at oral argument before the Commission: 
1112,," Commissioner Hearn: Now, do you contend that, furthering Mr. Patterson's question, do carrier members of AFBO, purely 
by reason of the foreign inter-port carriage, can act with impunity so far as this Commission is concerned, dealing with 
MSTS and AID cargo, even to the detriment of the United States-flag carrier? Mr. Poole: So far as the Shipping Act is concerned, yes.  I think they take their chances under the antitrust laws. Commissioner Hearn: Well, in that case, you draw the distinction between foreign commerce of the United States and 
section 15 here? Mr. Poole: Yes. Well, section 15 I think, can only be read in reference to section 1 of the Act where it defines those carriers which are 
subject to the regulation of the Shipping Act. There section 1 makes it pretty clear that it is only those carriers which are in 
the foreign trade from or to ports in the United States or districts, territories, and possessions of the United States are those 
carriers in the foreign commerce which are regulated by the Shipping Act. What I am saying is it has been held, and I think it is true, that the jurisdiction under the Shipping Act is more restrictive than 
the jurisdiction under the antitrust laws. That is why I objected to antitrust principles being dragged in by the heels, so to 
speak, to define the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Shipping Act. (JA 148)"
1112,19," In our view the judgment cannot be affirmed because of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction invoked by appellees.  The Hearing 
Examiners' findings insofar as they are purely factual are not really contested.  Insofar as they make judgment on matters like 
legal causality under anti -trust standards, their significance is limited both because the Commission made no ruling on them, 
and in any event, they do not lie within the area of expertise which justifies deference to the agency's findings. Furthermore, the purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine is to harmonize the application of antitrust and regulatory policies.  
The Commission held merely that it had no regulatory power with respect to this conspiracy, not that this was lawful behavior 
under the Act and consistent with public interest. Compare S.W.W., Inc. v. Air Transport Ass'n of America, 89 U.S. App. D.C. 
273, 280, 191 F.2d 658, 664 (1951), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 955, 72 S. Ct. 1049, 96 L. Ed. 1355 (1952)."
1112,20," Defendants' point rests on analogy from cases involving restraints in interstate commerce, holding the Sherman Act is 
applicable only where the target of the restraint is interstate commerce, e.g., Lieberthal v. North Country Lanes, 332 F.2d 269, 
272 (2d Cir. 1964); Page v. Work, 290 F.2d 323, 330 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 875, 7 L. Ed. 2d 76, 82 S. Ct. 121 (1961); 
David Cabrera, Inc. v. Union de Choferes y Duenos, 256 F. Supp. 839, 843-44 (D.P.R. 1966). "
1113,," Similarly the defendants urge that United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 230-32, 233, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 
(1947) holds that the ""commerce "" affected by a restraint on transportation is determined by terminal points of the journey.  In 
that case, the Supreme Court dismissed, for want of a restraint of interstate commerce, that portion of the Government's antitrust 
complaint that related to a monopoly of local taxicab service.  However, the problem there is primarily whether the federal 
government, acting within the framework of a federal system, has power to deal with such local restraint.  The issue turns, as it 
must under the Constitution, on whether the facts show an effect on interstate commerce. The disclaimer of interstate commerce 
does not constitute a withdrawal of American law, but an assessment that what is involved is a matter of local law rather than 
national law. Where foreign commerce is involved, however, the issues are different.  In a sense the question of interpretation may still be 
similar: Whether United States regulation is reasonable in light of the international, rather than intrastate, character of the trade. 
However, the problem is different for the courts because the question may properly be answered by reference to factors such as 
citizenship that are meaningful in an international setting yet not involved where the issue is whether local commerce or national 
interstate commerce is restrained.  Furthermore, the courts have an obligation to follow Congressional will that is greater when 
the only reason for failure to do so is lack of harmony with principles of international law, than it is when the Congressional 
intention is counter to the Constitutional mandates reserving the regulation of local affairs to the states rather than to Congress.

where the Government, appealing a dismissal of an indictment, argued that even if insurance was not ""commerce"" a restraint in 
the insurance industry was a restraint on those industries which must buy fire insurance.  Because of its broad reading of 
""commerce"" the Court found it unnecessary to pass on such questions."

as equivalent to occupation, employment, or business, whether manual or mercantile.  Wherever any occupation, 
employment, or business is carried on for the purpose of profit, or gain, or a livelihood, not in the liberal arts or in the

1114,29," Defendants note that the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. ยง 688, according a remedy to seamen injured in the course of their

defendants contend that this is mere application of the internationally recognized principle that for purposes of on-board conduct 
and regulation of the crew, ships are part of the territory of the flag nation.  United States v. Flores, 289 U.S. 137, 77 L. Ed. 
1086, 53 S. Ct. 580 (1933). While it may be that the fiction justifies application of United States law to American vessels as a 
matter of international law, it by no means follows that this serves as the source of Congressional power under our constitutional 
law.  The constitutional basis of the National Labor Relations Act is, pure and simple, the commerce power. "

1115,31," In United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 443 (2d Cir. 1945), Judge Learned Hand wrote: ""Nevertheless, it 
is quite true that we are not to read general words, such as those in this Act, without regard to the limitations customarily 
observed by nations upon the exercise of their powers; limitations which generally correspond to those fixed by the 'Conflict of 
Laws.' We should not impute to Congress an intent to punish all whom its courts can catch, for conduct which has no 
consequences within the United States."" The International complications that have arisen concerning the application of United States antitrust laws to foreign commerce 
relate primarily to subjection of foreigners to United States laws for acts not done in the United States.  See e.g., British Nylon 
Spinners, Ltd. v. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., 2 All E.R. 780 (Ct. App. 1952). The theory on which this liability has 
proceeded is that ""any state may impose liabilities, even upon persons not within its allegiance, for conduct outside its borders 
that has consequences within its borders which the state reprehends; and these liabilities other states will ordinarily recognize."" 
United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, supra, 148 F.2d at 443. Conformance to international law is argued by analogy to the 
decision in The Case of the S.S. ""Lotus"" P.C.I.J. Ser. A. No. 10 (1927). In the case at bar, however, no such international complications are present insofar as nationality is a recognized international 
basis for prescribing conduct, cf. Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421, 76 L. Ed. 375, 52 S. Ct. 252 (1932), and in any event 
the interests of foreign parties are insubstantial.  Thus while we agree with defendants' arguments that considerations of comity 
are appropriate in construction of the antitrust laws, we think that here it is the Sherman Act's applicability, rather than

1183,1," In addition to charging the existence of a combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade, plaintiff alleges that defendant has 
unlawfully attempted to monopolize the sale and distribution of defendant's products throughout the United States and that 
defendant's refusal to continue to deal with plaintiff was in furtherance of that attempt.  Such monopolistic behavior, if 
established, would constitute a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Because the Court finds that there is clear and 
convincing proof of the existence of a combination to achieve resale price maintenance and other per se illegalities, it is 
unnecessary to resolve the complex questions presented by the alleged violation of Section 2. "
1186,2," Because Minolta competes with many of its distributors in the sale of photographic equipment, plaintiff claims that the 
conspiracy is not only vertical. See, e.g., United States v. McKesson & Robbins, 351 U.S. 305, 100 L. Ed. 1209, 76 S. Ct. 937 
(1955). The presence of vertical agreements would not be essential to the establishment of a horizontal combination to fix prices 
if substantial price uniformity were achieved at the distributor level.  See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 83 
L. Ed. 610, 59 S. Ct. 467 (1939). Plaintiff does not, however, stress the horizontal aspects of price-fixing by Minolta and its co-
distributors.  The greater part of the record consists of proof of vertical constraint and coercion to achieve resale price 
maintenance. The Court notes, however, that proof of the existence of unlawful resale price maintenance, where the manufacturer is also a 
distributor -- as Minolta is -- makes the antitrust violation even more pernicious, see, United States v. McKesson & Robbins, 
supra, for unlawful cartel activity then co-exists with the attempt to vertically control the discretion of the independent 
businessman. "
1187,3," Mere complaints by customers of a manufacturer that distributors and dealers engage in price-cutting and selective discounting 
are not enough to imply a combination in violation of ยง 1, for such complaints arise in the normal course of business.  Carbon 
Steel Products Corp. v. Alan Wood Steel Co., 289 F. Supp. 584 (S.D.N.Y. 1968). Where, however, the manufacturer takes action and relays these complaints to the distributors with accompanying words of 
""advice"", a combination to maintain resale prices can be implied. Minolta has gone even further by employing its sales 
representatives to police the market. "
1188,4," The territorial restrictions can be viewed in several ways but the Court finds them unlawful under all applicable theories. HN6[
] Horizontal arrangements among competitors to divide territories are unlawful per se.  See, e.g., Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 95 L. Ed. 1199, 71 S. Ct. 971 (1951); Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, supra. 
Since Minolta is not only a manufacturer but also a distributor of its own goods, its several contracts with co-distributors which 
restrict the area of distribution amount to a horizontal combination in restraint of trade. In White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963), the Supreme Court refused to apply 
the per se standard, on the record before it, HN7[
] to vertically imposed territorial limitations where they were not an integral 
part of a price-fixing scheme; and the Court proposed a rule of reason inquiry.  The rationale is apparently that, where a 
manufacturer restricts the territory of his distributors, there may be some justifiable purpose other than that of stifling 
competition, and therefore a per se rule would be inappropriate.  Accord, Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 847 (6th Cir. 1964) 
(applying the rule of reason to uphold a scheme of exclusive territories where the manufacturer was a failing company utilizing 
the scheme to insure its survival). In United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., supra 388 U.S. at 374, the court indicates, without elaboration, that White Motor 
survives and, therefore, some vertical territorial restraints may be ""sheltered"" by the rule of reason because they are not 
anticompetitive. The Court, however, restates the established rule that, HN8[
] where vertical territorial restraints are ancillary to price-fixing, or 
where the price-fixing is an integral part of the distribution system, the price-fixing ""infects"" the distribution restrictions, and 
renders them per se unlawful.  388 U.S. at 375-76. Minolta's activities fall within this established rule and are, therefore, per se 
unlawful even if the combination to divide territories is not viewed as being horizontal in nature. Moreover, Schwinn ultimately holds, HN9[
] that even absent any price-fixing scheme, ""where a manufacturer sells products to 
his distributor subject to territorial restrictions upon resale, a per se violation of the Sherman Act results"", 388 U.S. at 379. 
Whether White Motor retains any vitality after this holding, despite the majority's insistence that it does, remains to be seen (see 
opinion of Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part, 388 U.S. at 388-89). In any event, Minolta's distribution 
agreement falls squarely within the proscription of Schwinn. "
1189,5," Minolta claims that, in furtherance of the asserted plan, several officers of Minolta made contact with its New York bank 
regarding the possibility of acquiring a substantial line of credit.  (Nakamura Affidavit para. 3).  No affidavits are submitted from 
any of the named bank officials with whom the plans were allegedly discussed. Defendant does annex four exhibits purporting to represent Minolta's plans which were reviewed by the bank.  (Nakamura 
Affidavit, Exhs. E, F, G and H).  The exhibits are unaccompanied by any explanation of their content, the significance of which 
eludes the Court."
1189,6," Minolta claims that it has distrusted Interphoto since 1967, when apparently Interphoto sold a large block of Minolta products on 
the West Coast at a discount.  Minolta urges that it should not be forced to deal with a distributor in whom it lacks confidence 
(Nakamura Affidavit, para. 5), and points to this distrust as a factor entering into its decision to terminate the distributorship. The Court rejects this argument.  The distrust is, in reality, nothing but the fear that Interphoto will not adhere to suggested 
resale prices.  This is precisely the violation of the antitrust laws which Interphoto has established.  Minolta cannot be heard to 
say that it distrusts Interphoto on this account.  Moreover, Minolta cannot with good conscience claim a lack of confidence in 
Interphoto, which, by Minolta's own admission, has been a highly successful distributor. (Zimet Affidavit, Exh. N). "
1190,7," The Court recognizes that a manufacturer may exploit his monopoly by selling his product directly to the ultimate consumer if 
he chooses.  Similarly, he may eliminate existing distributors, establish new ones, or vary his distribution program without 
violating the antitrust laws but only ""so long as such power is not being exercised as part of or in aid of something else which is 
prohibited by the antitrust laws"".  Industrial Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., 278 F. Supp. 938, 958-59, 964 (D.C. 
Cal. 1967). On the record before the Court, Minolta has not shown that its conduct falls within the permissible, lawful channels. "
1191,8," Plaintiff states that Minolta accounts for 40% of plaintiff's sales of Japanese-made cameras and lenses.  In addition, 40% of the 
orders received by plaintiff for such Japanese products apparently specify some Minolta brand product.  (Behrendt Affidavit, 
para. 4).  Defendant does not refute any of these contentions.  If Interphoto cannot furnish Minolta products to its retail 
customers, immediate loss of customers may follow.  Indeed, plaintiff has already received complaints about the possible 
absence of Minolta goods from its inventory, accompanied by threats to do business elsewhere."
1191,9," Much of Minolta's proof on the question of irreparable harm consists of its insistence that Interphoto knew that Minolta had 
plans to become its own distributor and was thereby forewarned of the eventual termination of the distributorship. Interphoto 
denies such knowledge; the affidavits on this particular point are conflicting.  However, looking at the documentary proof, the 
Court finds that the communications from Minolta to Interphoto in no way reveal the existence of a relationship which is about to

would not have to show that Interphoto knew of its plans to cancel the distributorship, if the cancellation were lawful and 
pursuant to the contract, for Interphoto could not then rely on the fact that it assumed the relationship between the parties would 
continue.  But the cancellation by Minolta is not lawful, because it is in furtherance of a conspiracy. Minolta cannot claim that 
Interphoto has not suffered irreparable harm because the threat of cancellation was known to it. "

1208,2," The release sent out by AMI to its licensees on March 28, 1956 appears in Appendix Number 1."
1208,3," David Teichman, a brother of Arthur Murray, testified that in 1955 and 1956 approximately 55% of the stock of AMI was owned 
by AMI licensees, approximately 20% by members of the family of Arthur Murray and Kathryn Murray, his wife (although Arthur 
and Kathryn did not own any of the stock themselves), and that the remainder of the stock was owned by AMI and its 
employees.  (At that time, Teichman was Vice-President, Treasurer and Business Manager of AMI.) In 1956, Arthur Murray, Teichman and his wife, Robert Norman (Kathryn Murray's brother), and Rebecca Roman (Arthur and 
Kathryn Murray's daughter) together owned over 40% of the stock in ECB-KC and W.E. Gregory, Manager of ECB-KC, owned 
over 10%.  (Teichman, Robert Norman and Kathryn Murray were members of the Board of Directors of ECB-KC in 1956 and 
Norman was its Vice-President.) Teichman and his wife owned 55% of the stock of ECB-NY and Kathryn Murray's brother had 
an additional 20%.  Two brothers of Arthur Murray and the wife of one owned over 22% of the stock of TPI and Gregory and 
Charles E. Redhair, Manager of TPI, owned over 7% each.  (Teichman managed ECB-NY and Teichman and Redhair were 
members of the Board of Directors of TPI.) Reserve Plan, Inc. v. Arthur Murray, Inc., 38 F.R.D. 23, 29-30 (W.D. Mo. 1965). "
1210,4," Mr. Teichman wrote Mr. C.C. Hart, plaintiff's president, on April 13, 1956 that it was certainly not AMI's intention when issuing 
the March 28th release to imply that plaintiff was not operating properly or that it had not cooperated with AMI in the past. "
1211,5," This consent decree appears in Appendix Number 2-A and the letter sent out by AMI to its licensees in regard thereto appears 
in Appendix Number 2-B. "
1213,6," Also, plaintiff's books were kept on an accrual basis and the income for tax purposes was reported on a cash basis. "
1214,7," The special master's calculation of the discount income attributable to Arthur Murray accounts for the fiscal year ending July 31, 
1955 was $124,764.29 and for the year ending July 31, 1956 it was $120,303.30. "
1215,8, The table appears in Appendix Number 3.
1215,9," Judge Oliver said: ""It should be noted that this calculation does not take into account the fact that the pattern generally reflected by plaintiff's 
full business experience in regard to the amount of executive salary paid plaintiff's president was that, generally speaking, 
he drew a salary in excess of the $25,000 when the volume of annual discount income was greater than it was in the 1951-
1952 period (the year 1953 was an exception; plaintiff's president elected to draw no salary in that year).  Such was 
certainly true in fiscal year 1954 in which plaintiff's president was paid $40,402.58.  We do not agree with the suggestion in 
some of the briefs, as distinguished from any evidence adduced by defendants, that a portion of plaintiff's president's 
executive salary should properly be allocated to the expense of handling the additional discount income.  We find that 
plaintiff properly omitted that item from those listed in PX 58. "" Reserve Plan, Inc. v. Arthur Murray, Inc., 262 F. Supp. 565, 
569 (W.D. Mo. 1967). "
1219,1," Reserve Plan estimated that it would take only $22,800.00 in extra operational expenses per year to handle $90,000.00 to 
$100,000.00 additional income per month. "
1220,2," This appears in Judge Oliver's opinion as $57,791.55, which is evidently a typographical error. "
1242,1," The suit was originally filed in the name of Water Services, Inc. The Farris Chemical Company is the manufacturing subsidiary 
of Water Services, Inc. Clyde A. Farris, Jr. organized and is president of both corporations. By agreement, the subsidiary was 
added as a party plaintiff at trial. For convenience, in this opinion we regard the two companies as one. "
1243,2," Farris concealed the identity of the components by replacing the label of the original manufacturer with a Farris Chemical label, 
and by replacing the standard colors with other colors. "
1244,3," Glad suffers from leg ""trouble"" and other ailments. His work entailed climbing on tanks and other parts of an industrial system. 
The district court found that partly because of these ailments and partly because of ""apparent disenchantment between him and 
Farris, early in 1966 Glad began to look around for other employment, which would provide him an inside job""."

] Traditional common-law restraints fall into two classes: (1) restraints ""ancillary"" to valid underlying contracts, including 
employment contracts, and contracts for the sale of a business; (2) restraints not ""ancillary"" to valid underlying contracts, but 
typically undertaken to divide territory or markets, limit production, fix prices, or buy out potential competitors. ""Non-ancillary"" 
restraints are usually the subject of antitrust action under the Sherman Act, while ""ancillary"" restraints are usually left to state 
law. See United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 6 Cir. 1898, 85 F. 271, 282-283, 46 L.R.A. 122, aff'd, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S.

1246,5," Section 6-1611 of the Code of Georgia, which embodies the ""full bench rule"", provides in part: ""* * * HN5[

concurrence of six Justices, and then after argument had, in which the decision, by permission of the court, is expressly 
questioned and reviewed; and after such argument, the court in its decision shall state distinctly whether it affirms, reverses, or 
changes such decision."" Thus, the only decisions which are controlling on the case at bar are the full bench decisions, which, 
until overruled or modified, have the force and effect of statutory law.  Crown Laundry v. Burch, 205 Ga. 211, 212, 53 S.E.2d 
116, 117 (1949) (full bench). In Sowell v. Sowell, 1956, 212 Ga. 351, 353, 92 S.E.2d 524, 526, the Supreme Court of Georgia said: HN6[
] ""Where there is a 
conflict existing in the decisions of this court, the correct rule must be determined from the earliest decisions on the subject, and 
unless overruled, they are controlling."" The Supreme Court of Georgia has taken judicial notice that its Justices now number 
seven, and the full bench statute is applied as if it required seven concurrences to constitute a full bench decision.

done appellant. Appellant attempted to inject these issues in the case in 1966, 8 years after the case started and after Simpson had filed a 
Pretrial statement in 1965 which had not contained them.  The trial court properly excluded them as untimely and as injected 
""solely because of plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the court's ruling"" on the ""equities"" issue, and thereby protracting the trial.  The 
trial judge acted properly. "

taken.  Thus the case went to jury much like a personal injury case in which the plaintiff was fully incapacitated and had lost his 
entire earning power. "
1279,*," In 1967, defendant changed the designation of its ""Kedettes"" footwear to its registered trademark ""Grasshoppers"", a name 
formerly used to designate a style of ""Keds"".  In 1968, defendant broadened the ""Grasshoppers"" line to include leather sandals 
previously called ""Royal Continentals"" which are not included in this action.  Throughout this opinion and the findings herein, the 
term ""Kedettes"", whether or not so expressly stated, shall include the footwear now called ""Grasshoppers"" as well, except for 
that portion of the line formerly called ""Royal Continentals"". "
1282,1," Both the ""Keds"" and ""Kedettes"" lines of canvas footwear comprise many different styles and types, each of which has its own 
name and code number.  In 1963, for example, defendant offered for sale over 100 different ""Keds"" styles and over 50 different 
""Kedettes"" styles. Many of these styles included a number of different colors as well as a full range of sizes and widths."
1282,2," During the past three years, defendant has sold ""Keds"" and ""Kedettes"" (or both) to retailers whose number has totaled:"
1282,1966, 
1282,28," ,801"
1282,1967, 
1282,27," ,435 "
1283,1968, 
1283,24," ,461 (first six months). Although precise data is not available, a reliable, conservative estimate by the defendant places the total number of retailers to 
whom it has sold ""Keds"", ""Kedettes"", or both at over 25,000 for each year since 1958."
1283,3," These salesmen, sometimes called sales representatives, have numbered between 200 and 225 in recent years, each being 
assigned to a geographical area called a territory.  These sales representatives work under the supervision of district sales 
managers. Defendant has assigned each district sales manager to a geographical area called a district, sometimes referred to 
as a ""red-line"" district. Each such manager has his headquarters within his district at a local office called a branch.  Branches 
have been located in various cities throughout the country.  Each district sales manager has a number of salesmen reporting to 
him and he assigns to each of them a territory within his district.  The district sales managers report to regional sales managers, 
each of whom is located within the region and supervises a number of district sales managers. Regional managers report to the 
manager of branch sales, who is stationed at defendant's principal office in New York City.  Until April 17, 1962, the manager of 
branch sales reported to the general sales manager of the footwear and general products division.  The latter reported to the 
general manager of that division, then a corporate vice president.  Since April 18, 1962, the manager of branch sales reports to a 
divisional vice president of the consumer and industrial products division.  The latter reports to the president of that division, who 
reports to the president of the corporation, Uniroyal's chief executive officer. Defendant compensates all of its sales employees in a manner calculated to encourage them to increase the volume of ""Keds"" 
and ""Kedettes"" sales.  The manager of branch sales, each regional sales manager, each district sales manager and each sales 
representative receive a fixed salary plus an annual bonus.  The bonus represents a substantial fraction of the employee's 
income and is directly proportional to the volume of sales produced by him, or, in the case of a manager, by his subordinates.  
Defendant also uses other means to encourage its sales employees to increase sales volume and to expand distribution by 
opening new accounts."

operates leased shoe departments in stores across the country.  Both are known discount operations.  However, the violations in 
connection therewith centered not only around prices but also around transshipment by these customers of ""Keds"" and 
""Kedettes"" to other of their outlets outside of the territory of the Uniroyal branch that had initially sold them the shoes.  Defendant 
has since accommodated its distribution operation to the needs of chains such as these."

1290,8," The Government has conceded that it has no direct evidence of violations of the antitrust laws in the Cleveland, Detroit and 
Chicago branches.  Defendant's evidence clearly established the existence of a competitive atmosphere and freedom from 
restraint or interference with retail pricing in the Chicago branch as well as in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  Defendant also 
showed the absence in New York City, Missouri, Massachusetts and California of restraint on or interference with retail pricing. "
1293,9," One incident occurred in Boulder, Colo. in 1964.  The other four of these incidents were continuations of older practices into the 
year 1964; one in Hamburg and East Aurora, N.Y. (Buffalo branch) began in 1958 and extended into 1967; another Buffalo 
incident began in 1958 but the witness was unable to fix dates later than that year for any conversations evidencing the alleged 
agreements and the Court has therefore fixed 1964, when the employment of the salesman involved was terminated, as the date 
ending the incident; an incident in Pompano Beach, Fla. (Miami branch) occurred during the period 1959 to 1965; finally, an 
incident involving C.R. Anthony (Kansas City branch) began in 1960 and ended in 1964."
1293,10," One was in Lamar, Colo. (Denver branch); another involved Berland (St. Louis branch); a third was in Austin, Tex. (Houston 
branch); and the fourth was in Renton, Wash. (Seattle branch)."
1293,11," These are: Los Angeles branch, 1958 (San Diego, Cal.); New Orleans, La., 1958; Boston branch, 1958 (two incidents, in 
Waltham, Mass. and Hartford, Conn.); Cincinnati branch, 1958 (Elwood, Ind.); Pittsburgh branch, 1958 (Charleston, W. Va.); 
Dallas branch, 1958 (Marfa, Tex.); Seattle branch, 1954 (Bellevue, Wash.)."
1293,12," In each of these fourteen branches the current situation is clear: there is, and has been for years, a general prevalence of 
price-cutting and an absence of any resale price maintenance or interference with retail pricing. "
1294,," There is substantial evidence that the two episodes proven in the Los Angeles branch area were isolated instances and not part 
of a general pattern.  Extensive proof of price competition and advertising since 1960 has been presented for this area. There is substantial evidence for the Denver branch area that no resale price maintenance has occurred and that price cutting 
has been unimpeded since April 30, 1967, the date on which T. S. Newton was replaced as District Sales Manager, which 
position he had held during the two incidents proven there. There were a number of instances proven for the Miami branch area of discount price advertising. In the Kansas City branch area, there has been proof of discount price advertising and, in addition, retailers have been 
affirmatively advised since 1965 that they are free to charge whatever prices they desire.  Since March, 1964 C. R. Anthony has 
been entirely free of restrictions on pricing and transshipment.  There has been no agreement similar to the one which existed 
prior to that date. Vigorous competition in the Baltimore branch area was demonstrated by the 1968 advertising and testimony of David Allen and 
by other applicable evidence. On August 21, 1962, Kenneth M. Kaligian, the District Sales Manager of the Boston branch, was replaced.  The evidence is 
clear that since his removal the local retailers have been free of retail price interference from the defendant.  In addition, Kenneth 
B. Miller, a Boston branch sales representative and author of several Government exhibits, left defendant's employ on December 
31, 1966.  The latter events in this branch are set out more fully above. As to the Missouri and New York City branches, defendant has proven that Berland resumed buying the products that defendant 
had withheld from it around the middle of 1963.  Since that time there has been no interference with Berland's pricing or 
transhipment.  Widespread price-cutting among retailers has been proved in New York City (Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, 
Bronx). In August, 1968, Stanley H. Kieon took over the Buffalo branch and merchandise has since been sold in that area without any 
resale price restrictions.  His predecessor, R. F. Kurrasch, had created difficulties. On November 1, 1967, John R. Eble, the District Sales Manager of the Cincinnati branch, was removed and placed in a position 
that has no responsibility for sales of ""Keds"" or ""Kedettes"". The evidence shows that since 1964 there has been no interference with retail pricing in West Virginia (Pittsburgh branch), two 
incidents having been proven in that area prior to that date. On September 30, 1967, J. C. Beavers was replaced as the District Sales Manager of the Dallas branch.  A series of letters and 
invoices demonstrated that the Houston branch, among others, does not interfere with transshipments of ""Keds"" and ""Kedettes"" 
even where the retailer involved (as revealed by his advertisements) is a price-cutter.  Indeed, Houston aids such shipments.  
The only concern of the District Sales Manager there is with sales credits and commissions. As to the Seattle branch, defendant has established that since 1965 it has not even suggested prices.  Competitive advertising 
and the absence of any interference with retail pricing have been demonstrated in that area."
1294,13," Neither the 1962 incident in the Atlanta branch nor the 1958 incident in the New Orleans branch was shown to be a typical 
occurrence in those areas.  Certainly the latter incident is remote indeed when considered as part of a request for injunctive 
relief. Neither incident provides the basis for an inference of the existence of an ongoing practice for which this remedy would be 
appropriate."
1294,14," The states involved, listed in alphabetical order with the dates of the advertisements proven, are: "

1318,1," In its initial findings, handed down on  January 25, 1965, 239 F.Supp., at 76, the District Court concluded that Zenith had 
suffered actual damages of $ 16,238,872 as a result of the restraints imposed by the three pools upon Zenith's export business 
during the four-year damage period: Canada: Television $ 5,826,896 Radio"

1318,66," ,769 Total"
1318,16," ,238,872 On April 5, 1965, the District Court entered partial judgment, awarding Zenith treble damages for patent misuse and treble 
damages with respect to Canada, but reserving jurisdiction for further hearings on damages in the English and Australian 
markets.  The further proceedings were held in October and November 1965, after which the District Court amended its findings 
on damages for England and Australia: England: Television $ 4,312,924 Radio "
1319,745," ,102 Australia: Television"
1319,223," ,508 Radio"
1319,24," ,952 Total"
1319,5," ,306,486 These revisions reflect the proof submitted at the further proceedings, showing that government embargoes in England and 
Australia, in effect until 1959 and 1960 respectively, precluded entry by Zenith into the English and Australian markets.  The 
District Court found, with respect to England, that because of the embargoes, Zenith's damages were zero for the first year of 
the damage period, 50% of the figure initially accepted by the court for the second year, 75% for the third, and 100% for the 
fourth.  With respect to Australia, the District Court adopted a similar 0-50-75-100% revision of the original figures used by the 
court in computing the damage findings of January 25, 1965."
1319,2," The record discloses that Zenith, HRI, and the courts below all considered the damage period to be the four years prior to the 
date on which Zenith filed its counterclaim. No argument was made that the counterclaim, in whole or in part, related back to an 
earlier pleading, thereby expanding the damage period to include years prior to 1959.  Cf.   Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 
262 and n. 10 (1935); Cold Metal Process Co. v.  E. W. Bliss Co., 285 F.2d 231 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1960), cert. denied,  366 U.S. 911 
(1961). Cf.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15 (c) (amended pleading relates back to date of original pleading if the ""claim or defense "
1320,," asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in 
the original pleading"")."
1320,3," During the proceedings before the District Court on April 2, 1965, the trial judge noted: ""Well, of course, Hazeltine Corporation 
wasn't a party to the lawsuit."" The court's reliance upon the stipulation as a basis for its decision to enter judgment against 
Hazeltine as well as HRI is reflected by the interchanges between the court and counsel for Hazeltine during those proceedings.  
An example is the following: ""Mr. Kayser [counsel for Hazeltine]: . . .  Could anyone really believe for a minute that if he had any thought of bringing the 
parent into this lawsuit that he would not have named them and that he would be relying on this stipulation which was intended 
to simplify and expedite the trial?  Would any lawyer who has been practicing for two years expect to hold somebody liable on a 
judgment when he didn't even name them?  He relied on some pretrial stipulation. ""The Court: You mean that pretrial stipulations are worthless?"" "
1321,4," There is some indication that the genesis of the stipulation was a pretrial conference, when a question was raised as to 
whether or not a subpoena served upon HRI could reach certain records of Hazeltine relating to the latter's foreign patents. 
Hazeltine, of course, argues that the stipulation's only purpose and effect were to facilitate discovery and trial by obviating the 
necessity of litigating whether or not Zenith could ""pierce the corporate veil"" between HRI and its parent."
1321,5," In its brief in this Court, Zenith seems to argue that Hazeltine is estopped to deny that it is bound by the stipulation.  Not only 
was HRI's counsel, Dodds, an officer of Hazeltine, but also Ruestow and Westermann, Hazeltine's general patent counsel and 
general counsel, were present during trial and failed to ""repudiate"" the construction allegedly given the stipulation by the parties 
at trial to the effect that it bound Hazeltine to any adjudication on the counterclaim. We find this theory untenable on the record of 
this case, for the references during trial to the stipulation are equally consistent with the interpretation advanced by Hazeltine 
that the stipulation merely eliminated the necessity for Zenith to perform the time-consuming task of piercing the corporate veil in 
proving its counterclaim against HRI.  Also, Ruestow and Westermann were called as witnesses during trial, and assuming they 
were present throughout the trial -- a fact which is neither proved nor disproved by the record -- their failure to repudiate Zenith's 
proposed construction of the stipulation is entirely consistent with the proposition that they were present only as witnesses, and 
not as authorized representatives for a person who might be bound by the litigation."
1321,6," Just as the alter ego issue was not litigated after Hazeltine had made its special appearance and while it had an opportunity to 
be heard, see supra, at 111, so the District Court evidently did not rely upon anything more than the stipulation as a basis for 
entering the injunction against Hazeltine as well as HRI.  The record does not support the contention, implicit in Zenith's brief, 
that when Hazeltine appeared to contest jurisdiction it was found by the District Court to be ""in active concert or participation"" "
1322,," with HRI and that, by entering its special appearance, Hazeltine consented to be bound by such a finding.  See generally Dobbs, 
The Validation of Void Judgments: The Bootstrap Principle (pts. 1 and 2),  53 Va. L. Rev. 1003, 1241 (1967)."
1322,7," Although HRI and Hazeltine were not parties to this prior litigation and did not enter the settlement agreement, HRI urged that 
all joint tortfeasors, including HRI and Hazeltine, were released from liability for injuries flowing from the pre-settlement acts of 
the pools. The 1957 release appears to be relevant only to Zenith's claim for injury to its Canadian trade; the embargoes in 
England and Australia were thought by the District Court to preclude any injury from acts of the English and Australian pools, 
and the embargoes were not lifted until well after the settlement was executed."
1322,8," The Court of Appeals did not disturb, nor do we, the findings of the District Court that HRI and Hazeltine conspired with the 
Canadian pool to deny patent licenses to companies seeking to export American-made goods to Canada.  Accepting these 
findings, we have no doubt that the Sherman Act was violated.  See, e. g., Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.  United States, 341 U.S. 
593, 599 (1951); Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704 (1962). Once Zenith demonstrated 
that its exports from the United States had been restrained by pool activities, the treble-damage liability of the domestic company 
participating in the conspiracy was beyond question.  Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., supra. Cf. 
American Banana Co. v.  United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347 (1909);  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 443 
(C. A. 2d Cir. 1945). Although patent rights are here involved, the same conclusions follow.  See, for example,  United States v. 
Line Material Co., 333 U.S. 287, 305-315 (1948);  United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 196-197 (1963)."
1322,9," Zenith's burden of proving the fact of damage under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied by its proof of some damage flowing from 
the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry beyond this minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of damage.  HN3[
] It is 
enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative 
sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under ยง 4.  Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & 
Carbon Corp., supra, at 702 (1962); Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v.  International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 143-144 (1968) 
(concurring opinion). "
1323,10," Zenith's antitrust claim was asserted as a counterclaim in a patent infringement suit brought by RCA against Zenith and its 
subsidiary, the Rauland Corporation."
1323,11," The computation of damages, prepared by Zenith's experts and accepted by the District Court, see 239 F.Supp., at 76, reflects 
a comparison between Zenith's percentage share of the United States television market, ranging from 15.6% in 1959 to 21.7% in 
1963, and Zenith's actual share of the Canadian market during the same period, ranging from 3.1% in 1959 to 5.2% in 1961 and 
down to 3.2% in 1963.  Although we discuss only the measure of damages utilized for computing Zenith's injury in the Canadian 
television market, a comparable method was employed to determine Zenith's lost radio sales."
1323,12," On November 22, 1965, during the further proceedings held to consider damages for England and Australia, Zenith's 
executive vice-president and treasurer, Kaplan, testified: ""In Canada, our assumption was that we commenced the period starting June 1, 1959 as if we had a full blown organization, and 
had enjoyed the benefits of doing business there for years prior to that date."" "
1324,13," HRI's answer to Zenith's counterclaim did not plead a statute of limitations defense.  However, in the course of proceedings 
after entry of the District Court's initial findings of fact and conclusions of law, but before judgment, the trial court granted the oral 
motion of HRI's new counsel for ""leave to file"" defenses based on the statute of limitations and on the release given by Zenith 
pursuant to the 1957 settlement agreement.  The thrust of the former was primarily that the findings as to Canada had 
erroneously included damages resulting from conduct occurring prior to May 22, 1959.  The trial court, without further mention of 
these defenses, forthwith refused to set aside or amend the damage award as to Canada, thus either rejecting the statute of 
limitations defense or considering it to have been waived under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12 (h), as urged by Zenith in both the 
District Court and the Court of Appeals. Zenith itself had requested damages only for the four-year period prior to the filing of its counterclaim, and the findings of the 
District Court expressly limited the damages awarded to those occurring ""during the 4-year statutory damage period.""  239 
F.Supp., at 76. The Court of Appeals, although not purporting to pass on the statute of limitations defense, referred to the ""four 
year damage period"" and identified it as ""four years prior to the May 22, 1963, filing date of Zenith's counterclaim. 15 U. S. C. 
Sec. 15b.""  388 F.2d, at 35 and n. 4. The parties have not argued the matter here, and we make no further effort to penetrate the 
confusion surrounding this issue or to deal with the question of whether damage period injury from pre-damage period conduct is 
recoverable where an unwaived statute of limitations defense is properly asserted."
1324,14," On April 1, 1965, during the further proceedings held by the District Court before judgment, counsel for HRI stated: ""Now, what [counsel for Zenith] is really trying to sell this court is the idea that if he can show that these pools continued after 
1957 and, as he defines the pools, yes, yes, they did.  There is no question about it, that these arrangements in relation to 
patents -- that characterized necessarily as he characterizes them, but that these arrangements have continued and, so far as I 
know, are in existence today.  There is no question about that."" "
1325,," HRI does contend, however, that the ties between the Canadian pool and the Hazeltine companies were broken in December 
1965, when Hazeltine secured an early termination of its licensing agreement with CRPL.  See n. 25, infra."
1325,15," That Zenith failed to make a formal request for a CRPL license during the damage period can properly be attributed to Zenith's 
recognition that such a request would have been futile.  The pool had made its position entirely clear, and under these 
circumstances the absence of a formal request is not fatal to Zenith's case.  See Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & 
Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699-702 (1962); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v.  United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 487, n. 5 
(1968)."
1325,16," In 1960, the Report of the Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright and Industrial Designs was published.  This Report 
described the magnitude of the risk taken by Zenith and its distributors in selling imported products in Canada: ""The portfolio in respect of which CRPL had the right to grant licences consisted of 5,000 patents, and in the absence of a 
licence from CRPL it is doubtful if anyone could sell in Canada a radio or television receiver. ""CRPL indicated that it does not grant a licence to any importer of radio or television receivers . . . .  It is particularly in respect of 
the policy of CRPL in precluding importers from bringing into Canada radio and television receivers that the complaint was made 
to this Commission. ""It was stated to be the policy of CRPL to enforce its patent rights against any person who sells in Canada an imported radio or 
television receiver which infringes any one or more of the patents in its portfolio . . . ."""
1325,17," This letter, brought to Zenith's attention by an ex-Zenith dealer, warned the Motorola dealer that his importation of American-
made television sets and FM radios probably infringed pool patents. The dealer not only was cautioned that CRPL remained 
willing to litigate infringements, describing two recent and successful suits, but also was reminded of CRPL's policy against 
licensing imports: "
1326,," ""In closing, I wish to inform you that we would be most happy to issue a license to you to make or have made in Canada any 
equipment coming within the ambit of our patents."""
1326,18," HRI urges that the trial testimony as to Canada of each of two Zenith officers, Wright and Kaplan, was inconsistent with his 
own testimony on recall, inconsistent with the testimony of the other, and inconsistent with documentary evidence, and that we 
should therefore disregard their testimony.  It is true that the trial judge's views as to credibility are not completely impervious, 
but Rule 52 (a) admonishes due regard for the trial court's opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.  The Court of 
Appeals clearly took into account this evidence, and we see no adequate basis in the record for refusing to accept the testimony 
of the two Zenith officers as probative evidence.  See  United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U.S. 32, 37-38 (1918);  
Walling v. General Industries Co., 330 U.S. 545, 550 (1947); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.  Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 
609-612 (1950);  United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 332 (1952);  Orvis v. Higgins, 180 F.2d 537, 539-
540 (C. A. 2d Cir.), cert. denied,  340 U.S. 810 (1950);  Ruth v. Utah Construction & Mining Co., 344 F.2d 952 (C. A. 10th Cir. 
1965). HRI relies heavily in this respect on Zenith's annual reports for the years 1957-1962, but aside from the fact that these 
reports, except for 1962, were never admitted into evidence, we find them quite insufficient to undermine the credibility of Wright 
and Kaplan. "
1327,19," Wright testified that in mid-1955 a representative of the English pool had confirmed his understanding that ""the policy of the 
Pool . . . required that [radio and television] sets be made in England, and that nothing would be licensed if it was imported from 
abroad."" Wright further testified that the pool representative ""saw no possibility"" that this restrictive policy would be changed in 
the future.  Subsequently, during its dealings with its English radio distributor, Zenith was ""given to understand that television 
was just out of the question."""
1327,20," Because the embargo precluded any recovery by Zenith for the first year of the damage period, the trial court modified its 
initial measure of damages to reflect the time it would have taken Zenith, starting with the removal of the embargo, to build up its 
market share.  See n. 1, supra. "
1328,21," See American Banana Co. v.  United Fruit Co. 166 F. 261, 264 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1908), affirmed without specific reference to this 
issue,  213 U.S. 347 (1909);  Stearns v. Tinker & Rasor, 252 F.2d 589, 606 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1958); Volasco Products Co. v.  Lloyd 
A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383, 395-396 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied,  372 U.S. 907 (1963). Cf. Pennsylvania Sugar Rfg. 
Co. v.  American Sugar Rfg. Co., 166 F. 254, 260 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1908)."
1328,22," During trial, Wright and Kaplan testified that adjustments could be made by Zenith's English distributor in his shop to adapt 
Zenith television sets to the English transmission system.  However, the fair import of their testimony, both during trial and in 
November 1965 on recall, was that conversion of Zenith sets to the English system, whether done before shipment to England 
or in the distributor's shop, had in fact been carried out only occasionally in the past and was of questionable utility on a 
commercial basis.  Wright and Kaplan stated that Zenith could have manufactured a television set suitable for English use 
without appreciably more difficulty than Zenith faced in producing a new model for the American market, but the record does not 
indicate that Zenith took any steps in this direction before the end of the damage period, except in anticipation of the British 
changeover to the 625-line-per-second transmission system. "
1329,23," Paragraph C of the District Court's injunction prohibits HRI from ""Entering into, adhering to, enforcing or claiming any rights under any contract, agreement, understanding, plan or program, with 
any other person, company, patent pool, organization, association, corporation or entity which directly or indirectly restricts or 
prevents defendant-counterclaimant, Zenith Radio Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, from exporting any electronic 
apparatus from the United States into any foreign market."""
1329,24," Section 16 provides: HN8[
] ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the 
United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, . . . 
when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or 
damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings . . . ."" (Emphasis added.) 15 U. S. C. ยง 26. "
1330,25," HRI informs us that Hazeltine, having obtained an early termination of its licensing agreement with CRPL, is now prepared to 
license any one or more of its Canadian patents ""with no restrictions on imports."" Since Hazeltine's abandonment of its 
participation in the Canadian pool occurred only after -- and, apparently, in response to -- the District Court's judgment and 
decree, we cannot agree with the suggestion that injunctive relief as to Canada has been rendered unnecessary and 
inappropriate.  See  United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952);  United States v. Concentrated 
Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199, 202-203 (1968). Although HRI is free to attempt to demonstrate in the future that the 
need for injunctive relief with respect to Canada has been eliminated, or that a change of circumstances elsewhere justifies 
additional modifications of the injunction, see, e. g.,  United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633-636 (1953), we are not 
willing at this time to undertake a reappraisal of the injunction in light of post-trial developments."
1330,26," Having not disturbed the District Court's findings that HRI and Hazeltine were conspiring with English and Australian patent 
pools which refused to license imports, the Court of Appeals in any event should have sustained the injunction with respect to 
the English and Australian markets.  These findings, together with Zenith's demonstrated intent to expand its export business, 
were sufficient foundation for the conclusion that continued participation by HRI and Hazeltine in the English and Australian 
pools posed a significant threat of loss or damage to Zenith's business. "
1331,27," The District Court's injunction also included a paragraph barring HRI from continuing to coerce acceptance of its package 
license through the mechanism of offering a much lower royalty rate for those licensees who take a license on the entire 
package of patents rather than a license on merely a few of them.  Paragraph B enjoined HRI from ""Conditioning directly or indirectly the grant of any license to defendant-counterclaimant, Zenith Radio Corporation, or any of its 
subsidiaries, under any domestic patent upon the payment of the same or greater royalty rate than the rate at which licenses 
have been granted or offered to others under a group of domestic patents which includes said patent."" The Court of Appeals modified this paragraph in certain respects,  388 F.2d, at 39, but we do not disturb these modifications."
1331,28," The District Court concluded: ""Plaintiff's demands that royalties be paid on admittedly unpatented apparatus constitute misuse of its patent rights and plaintiff 
cannot justify such use of the monopolies of its patents, by arguing the necessities and convenience to it of such a policy.  While 
parties in an arms-length transaction are free to select any royalty base that may suit their mutual convenience, a patentee has 
no right to demand or force the payment of royalties on unpatented products.""  239 F.Supp., at 77. "
1333,29," The record and oral argument in Automatic Radio disclose no basis for the conclusion that Automatic Radio was forced into 
accepting the total-sales royalty rate by HRI's use of its patent leverage. "
1334,1," I find it unnecessary to consider the further question whether inclusion of such a provision should be held to violate the antitrust 
laws. "
1335,2," The Automatic Radio Court explicitly distinguished a number of cases of that kind, including  United States v. United States 
Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364 (1948), and Mercoid Corp. v.  Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661 (1944). See  339 U.S., at 
832-833."
1335,3," Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29 (1964), involved a different question: whether a royalty based solely upon use of the 
invention could be collected for use occurring after the patent's expiration."

comment, in referring to the use of ammonia as the nitriding agent, of the mechanism of the nitrogen penetration into steel. ""The 
atomic nitrogen which is formed in this decomposition process is extremely reactive before it recombines to form a nitrogen 
molecule N (2), - it is able to penetrate the steel surface and to diffuse into the steel."""
1344,4," The term arose, we are told, ""because previous gas nitriding was brittle, and the opposite to brittleness was soft in the German 
language, I understand, so they called it 'soft nitriding'."" It was a contradiction in terms in the metallurgical world since nitriding 
theretofore meant hardness and brittleness. "

problem."" Ex. 10, Tab 9, Machinery, March, 1965: ""An economical nitriding treatment eliminates spalling and decreases soldering of die 
casting dies."" ""Greatly improved operation of die casting dies has been observed by nitriding them with a low temperature, short-cycle process 
called Tufftriding."" Ex. 10, Tab 10, Hot Rod, March, 1965: (p. 32) ""The forged steel crank, having undergone the Tufftride process, is one of the 
Chevy bottom end highlights."" (Referring to new Chevrolet engine). Ex. 10, Tab 11, Iron Age, July 5, 1962: Describing an automated TUFFTRIDE system set up to treat crankshafts: ""Why did they automate Tufftriding? An unusual crankshaft design was needed for the new Willys Motors heavy duty 
Toronado-OHC engine.  Willys wanted a tough crankshaft with the right proportions and finish to assure good bearing life."" ""This made possible a lighter and simpler shaft.  It also gave high mechanical efficiency to the heat treated parts."" ""Machined from SAE 1045 steel forgings, the crankshafts promise higher reliability at lower costs."""

testimony in proper perspective, that at the beginning the Kolene people and Mr. Miel and Bidigare of Commercial Steel Treating 
were working together in a joint effort.  Subsequently, there was a falling out between Mr. Shoemaker, on the one hand, 
representing Kolene, and Mr. Miel, on the other hand, representing Commercial. ""As a result of that falling out, and subsequent to that falling out, Commercial Steel Treating Company, which was then under the 
control of Mr. Miel, went its own way and practiced the process that they were practicing, and they now adopted the trademark 
'Nu-nitride,' and they were continuing their operations without regard to any claim of right of Kolene. ""There was litigation between the Kolene people and between Commercial Steel Treating during the time that Mr. Miel controlled 
the operations of Commercial. Subsequently, the principal stockholders of Commercial Steel Treating Company had a falling out 
with Mr. Miel, and Mr. Miel left Commercial Steel Treating Company to form Motor City Company. ""Meanwhile, the stockholders of Commercial Steel Treating Company then returned back into operation with Kolene and 
became a licensee, and exclusive licensee for the Detroit area, except for Kolene's own operations under the Franchise system. ""Now, Mr. Miel and Bidigare, having left Commercial Steel Treating Company, formed Motor City Company, the present 
defendant, and continued in Motor City Company the same operations that they had previously performed in when they were in 
the employ of Commercial Steel Treating Company, and in the operations of Motor City Company, the same people, by the way, 
now call their process 'Cynatride.' ""This explains the peculiar thing, that Commercial Steel Treating Company was at one time controlled or operated by Mr. Miel 
and later was not, and also the peculiar fact that at one time Commercial Steel Treating Company was in a joint venture with 
Kolene and then later had a falling out with Kolene, and then still later returned to use the Kolene trademark and the Kolene
