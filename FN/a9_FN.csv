24,4," Id. Our interpretation of the seventh category of Section 15 parallels that of the Supreme Court in Federal Maritime Board v. 
Isbrandtsen Co., 356 U.S. 481, 2 L. Ed. 2d 926, 78 S. Ct. 851 (1958), with respect to the fourth category of Section 14 of the 
Shipping Act. The Court, after discussing the specific prohibitions of the first three categories of Section 14, made this analysis: Therefore, coordinate with these three clauses aimed at specific practices, a fourth category, couched in general language, 
was added: ""resort to other discriminating or unfair methods. . . ."" In the context of § 14 this clause must be construed as 
constituting a catchall clause by which Congress meant to prohibit other devices not specifically enumerated but similar in 
purpose and effect to those barred by § 14, First, Second, and the ""retaliate"" clause of § 14 Third. ( Id., at 492). "
25,5," This view is also supported by a contemporary comment on the type of agreements covered by the newly-enacted Section 15 
of the Shipping Act of 1916: ""Perhaps the most important of these [provisions of the Act] is § 15, which exempts from the 
operation of the anti-trust laws pooling, rate, and other co-operative agreements, which have been filed with and approved by 
the Board."" ""Current Legislation -- Government Regulation of Private Shipping,"" 17 Colum. L.R. 357, 358 (1917)."

states that ""nothing contained in this section shall apply to transactions duly consummated pursuant to authority given by the . . .

Supreme Court held that ""the words 'transactions duly consummated pursuant to authority' given [the Commission] 'under any 
statutory provision vesting such power' in it are plainly not a grant of power to adjudicate antitrust issues,"" since Congress did 
not intend in Section 7 to confer on any agency mentioned therein ""any authority or powers which it does not already possess.""

attention was primarily directed and to which its recommendations were exclusively directed) does not include a single 
agreement of merger or other form of corporate reorganization. The ""agreements"" represented in the Report are all ""on-going"" in nature.  Most of these ""agreements"" are cooperative 
working arrangements.  These ""agreements"" describe practices or regular activities in which two or more shipping 
companies have agreed to participate over a considerable period of time.  None of the ""agreements"" studied by the 
Alexander Committee bears the slightest resemblance to an agreement of merger, which is essentially a single, discrete 
event, which transforms the relationship of the merging parties at the instant of merger. United States v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, 325 F. Supp. 656, 658-59 (1971)."

with any other steamship companies, firms, or lines engaged directly or indirectly in the American trade, or (2) with 
American shippers, railroads or other transportation agencies. . . . Alexander Report, supra, note 18, at 419-20. "
29,," As the Committee noted: Most of the numerous agreements and conference arrangements discussed in the foregoing report were the outcome of 
rate wars, and represent a truce between the contending lines.  To terminate existing agreements would necessarily bring 
about one of two results: the lines would either engage in rate wars which would mean the elimination of the weak and the 
survival of the strong, or, to avoid a costly struggle, they would consolidate through common ownership . . . .  Either would 
mean a monopoly fully as effective, and it is believed more so, than can exist by virtue of an agreement. Id., at 416. The Committee also found that prohibiting such working agreements among steamship lines . . . would not only involve a wholesale disturbance of existing conditions in the shipping business but would deprive 
American exporters and importers of the advantages claimed as resulting from agreements and conferences if honestly and 
fairly conducted, such as greater regularity and frequency of service, stability and uniformity of rates, economy in the cost of 
service, better distribution of sailings, maintenance of American and European rates to foreign markets on a parity, and 
equal treatment of shippers through the elimination of secret arrangements and underhanded methods of discrimination. . .

29,27," As the Court in Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Company, Inc., supra, noted ""the Alexander Report was submitted in 
1914 to the 63d Congress and a bill to carry out its recommendations was introduced but not passed.  H.R. 17328, 63d Cong., 
2d Sess.  In the following Congress substantially the same bill was reintroduced, H.R. 15455, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., and 
became the Shipping Act of 1916."" 356 U.S. at 490, n. 11. "
30,28," The following indicates the range of non-price competition: If we assume, theoretically, that the members of a conference adhere strictly to their agreement, then they must compete 
with each other on a so-called nonprice basis.  Better service would appear to be the principal inducement to offer to 
shippers in an effort to obtain their patronage.  This means offering faster, more convenient schedules, and special facilities 
for cargo handling -- e. g., refrigerated space.  However, even speed may be ruled out as a competitive factor.  In some 
conferences, rates have been geared to speed -- the slower the vessel the lower the rates.  Actually competition often goes 
beyond these theoretical confines.  Violations of agreements occur and competition intrudes on rates.  The abuses will 
persist so long as they are not flagrant or discovered by disadvantaged ""clean"" competitors.  Such ""shadings"" of the rules 
are difficult to eliminate in an arrangement based on self-interest but calling for self-discipline.  Competition among 
conference members is often intense, depending upon conditions in the trade. Gorder, United States Shipping Policy, 146 (1956); see also Marx, International Shipping Conferences, 250-251 (1953)."

aware of Congress' intent with respect to Section 7 is evident from the letter of the Commission's Vice Chairman to the 
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee to Consider H.R. 2734, in which he states: It does not appear that the provisions of H.R. 2734 are intended directly or indirectly to affect the above-quoted exemption 
from the Anti-Trust Laws provided in section 15 of the Shipping Act.  However, in view of the fact that the bill contains 
provisions specifically recognizing an exemption in respect of transactions approved by specified agencies under statutory 
authority, the Commission believes that the section in question should be amended to exempt from section 7 of the Clayton 
Act, as proposed to be amended by the bill, the transactions approved pursuant to authority given by the Maritime 
Commission under statutory authority such as the aforesaid section 15 of the Shipping Act, 1916.  This would avoid 
undesirable controversy which is likely to arise from any contention that the failure to include the Maritime Commission 
among the agencies specifically mentioned makes agreements approved by the Commission . . . subject to provisions of 
section 7 of the Clayton Act.  Reply Brief for Respondent, Federal Maritime Commission, Appendix, p. 2, quoting excerpt from Letter from the United States

32,39," The first case advanced by the FMC, New York and Porto Rican S.S. Co. -- Waterman S.S. Corp.  Agreement (2 U.S.M.C. 
453 (1940)), involved a sale of good will by one common carrier by water to another, together with an agreement not to compete 
in the Gulf of Mexico-Puerto Rico service for a period of ten years.  In view of the latter provision, the Commission found the 
transaction to be one which ""controls, regulates, prevents, and destroys competition in the Puerto Rican trade"" and that it was 
therefore subject to FMC jurisdiction under Section 15.  The situation presented by the case at bar, however, involves simply a 
sale by Oceanic of its fleet of four vessels and its interest in two containerships, together with a transfer of related personnel and 
shoreside equipment, to Pacific Far East Line.  Oceanic retains its corporate existence and is free to re-enter the North 
American Pacific Coast-Australasian or any other trade at any time. The second case cited by the Commission is Agreements 8745 and 8745-1, Purchase of Vessels ""Alicia"" and ""Dorothy"" (7 
F.M.C. 199 (1962)), which involved a sale of two vessels and an agreement on the part of the seller not to compete with the 
buyer in the Gulf of Mexico-Puerto Rico trade for a period of one year.  As such, the Commission found the sale to be one which 
""regulates, prevents, and destroys competition"" and therefore subject to the FMC's jurisdiction under Section 15.  The 
Commission underscores the fact that in that case it requested and received the views of, inter alia, the Antitrust Division of the 
Department of Justice on the proposed sale, indicating that the Antitrust Division had no objection to FMC approval of the 
transaction.  If the Commission believes that because there is a sale of vessels involved in the case at bar as well, that should 
suffice to give the FMC jurisdiction under Section 15, it fails to recognize the significant difference between the two cases: In 
Agreements 8745 and 8745-1, in addition to the sale of vessels, there was a covenant not to compete for one year, which clearly 
""controls, regulates, prevents, and destroys competition""; in the case at bar, however, there is a simple sale of ships, with no 
such continuing restrictions imposed upon or agreed to by Oceanic. "
33,," Agreement No. 8555 Between Isbrandtsen S.S. Co., Isbrandtsen Co., Inc., and American Export Lines, Inc. (7 F.M.C. 125 
(1962)), the third case cited by the Commission, involved a sale by Isbrandtsen of its liner fleet of fourteen vessels and its entire 
business, including good will, to American Export, as well as agreeing not to compete in the services transferred without 
American Export's consent.  There is no such agreement ""controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying competition"" in the 
case at bar. The fourth case advanced by the Commission is Agreement for Consolidation or Merger Between American Mail Line Ltd., 
American President Lines Ltd., and Pacific Far East Line, Inc. (11 F.M.C. 53 (1967), rev'd on other grounds, Matson Navigation 
Co. v. FMC, 405 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1968)), involving an agreement for the merger or consolidation of three lines, with at least 
American Mail remaining a separate division for steamship operations; or, in the alternative, merging American President Lines 
and Pacific Far East into a single entity, with American Mail remaining a subsidiary.  This case may be distinguished from the 
case at bar in that the former involved a merger or consolidation, not simply a sale in which both the buyer and seller retain their 
separate corporate existence and in which the seller is free at any time to compete with the buyer.  While the Commission in the 
former case stated that ""section 15 provides for continuing [FMC] supervision where it is called for -- but we do not concede that 
the provision for continuing supervision of agreements requiring it limits our authority to only those agreements"" (11 F.M.C., at 
60-61), the transaction in that case, a merger or consolidation, is fundamentally distinct from that presented by the case at bar.  
The Commission's finding in Matson that it had jurisdiction under Section 15, then, is not determinative of the issue in the case 
here, even assuming that the FMC correctly determined its jurisdiction in Matson.  See infra, our discussion of the Ninth Circuit's 
decision. Agreement 9905 Between Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., and American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc. (11 Pike & Fischer Ship 
Reg. Rep. 1090 (1970)), another case cited by the Commission, involves a contract of sale of four containerships, constructed 
with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, by Moore-McCormack to American Export.  The parties submitted the agreement 
for the United States Maritime Administration/Maritime Subsidy Board approval, not FMC approval under Section 15 (although 
the agreement does not itself preclude such review; it simply does not seek it).  Approval by the former agencies was sought in 
view of the parties' intention to award an operating-differential subsidy to a wholly-owned subsidiary to be created by American 
Export. The final case cited by the Commission is Agreement No. 9810 -- Stock Purchase Agreement Between Prudential Lines, Inc., 
and W.R. Grace & Co., and Transfer of Prudential Assets and Obligations to Grace Line, Inc. (13 F.M.C. 156 (1969)), providing 
for the purchase by Prudential from W.R. Grace & Co. of all the outstanding capital stock of Grace Line, leaving the latter as the 
sole operating company.  Despite the fact that Prudential and Grace Line served entirely different and unrelated trade routes 
prior to Commission approval of Agreement No. 9810, that case differs from the case at bar in that Prudential was eliminated 
altogether as an operating company and remained solely as a holding company, controlling all of Grace Line's outstanding 
capital stock.  As such, in contrast to the situation presented by the case at bar, there is clearly no incentive for Prudential to re -
enter its former or any other trade served by Grace Line, in view of its control of the latter.  Oceanic, however, might well decide 
to acquire vessels and related personnel and shoreside equipment again to re-enter the North American Pacific Coast-
Australasian or any other trade.  FMC jurisdiction here was not challenged by judicial review."
33,40," Another FMC case, not cited by the Commission here, Agreement No. 9827 Between United States Lines, Inc., and Sea-Land 
Service, Inc. (and Walter Kidde & Co., Inc., and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Co., Guarantors) (11 Pike & Fischer Ship Reg. 
Rep. 759 (1970)), involved an agreement which initially provided for a twenty-year lease by one common carrier by water of 
sixteen containerships and related equipment of another, with an option to purchase at the end of the lease period.  It was 
subsequently modified to provide for the merger of the two carriers, and was submitted to the FMC for approval under Section 
15.  The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New 
Jersey seeking to enjoin implementation of the merger agreement.  The FMC sought to intervene and have the proceedings 
stayed and the complaint dismissed.  The court ruled against the Commission, holding that the FMC does not have authority 
under Section 15 in regard to mergers in the shipping industry ( United States v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., supra, note 19). "
34,41," See note 36, supra, at 331."
34,42," The first is Agreement for Consolidation or Merger Between American Mail Line Ltd., American President Lines Ltd., and 
Pacific Far East Line, Inc., supra, note 39.  While finding in that case that the FMC does have jurisdiction under Section 15 to 
approve mergers, the Ninth Circuit vacated the Commission's order approving the merger on other grounds -- that the 
Commission must await final action by the parties, not simply agreement on their part to agree to merge or consolidate, before 
considering the arrangement.  As discussed infra, however, we believe the Ninth Circuit's decision to be in error with respect to 
the reach of Section 15 over mergers, and agree basically with Judge Carter's dissent. In the second, Agreement No. 9827 Between United States Lines, Inc., and Sea-Land Service, Inc. (and Walter Kidde & Co., 
Inc., and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Guarantors), supra, note 40, the court found the Commission without authority under 
Section 15 to approve shipping industry mergers, a conclusion with which we agree, infra. "

within the scope of the Alexander Report.  The case cannot be read to go the whole route and authorize FMC to approve

44,1," Topco, which is referred to at times in this opinion as the ""association,"" is actually composed of 23 chains of supermarket 
retailers and two retailer-owned cooperative wholesalers."
44,2," In addition to purchasing various items for its members, Topco performs other related functions: e. g., it insures that there is 
adequate quality control on the products that it purchases; it assists members in developing specifications on certain types of 
products (e. g., equipment and supplies); and it also aids the members in purchasing goods through other sources. "
45,3," The founding members of Topco were having difficulty competing with larger chains. This difficulty was attributable in some 
degree to the fact that the larger chains were capable of developing their own private-label programs. Private-label products differ from other brand-name products in that they are sold at a limited number of easily ascertainable 
stores.  A&P, for example, was a pioneer in developing a series of products that were sold under an A&P label and that were 
only available in A&P stores.  It is obvious that by using private-label products, a chain can achieve significant cost economies in 
purchasing, transportation, warehousing, promotion, and advertising.  These economies may afford the chain opportunities for 
offering private-label products at lower prices than other brand-name products.  This, in turn, provides many advantages of 
which some of the more important are: a store can offer national-brand products at the same price as other stores, while 
simultaneously offering a desirable, lower priced alternative; or, if the profit margin is sufficiently high on private-brand goods, 
national-brand products may be sold at reduced price.  Other advantages include: enabling a chain to bargain more favorably 
with national-brand manufacturers by creating a broader supply base of manufacturers, thereby decreasing dependence on a 
few, large national-brand manufacturers; enabling a chain to create a ""price-mix"" whereby prices on special items can be 
lowered to attract customers while profits are maintained on other items; and creation of general goodwill by offering lower 
priced, higher quality goods."
45,4," The three largest chains are A&P, Safeway, and Kroger. "
46,5," Topco was named in the complaint as the sole defendant, but the complaint clearly charged that its members, while not 
defendants, were coconspirators in Topco's violation of the Sherman Act. "
47,6," Article IX, § 8, of the bylaws provides, in relevant part: ""Unless a member's membership and licensing agreement provides that such member may sell at wholesale, a member may not 
wholesale products supplied by the Association.  If a membership and licensing agreement permits a member to sell at 
wholesale, such member shall control the resale of products bearing trademarks of the Association so that such sales are 
confined to the territories granted to the member, and the method of selling shall conform in all respects with the Association's 
policies."" Shortly before trial, Topco amended this bylaw with an addition that permitted any member to wholesale in the exclusive 
territories in which it retailed.  But the restriction remained the same in all other cases. It is apparent that this bylaw on its face applies whether or not the products sold are trademarked by Topco.  Despite the fact 
that Topco's general manager testified at trial that, in practice, the restriction is confined to Topco-branded products, the District 
Court found that the bylaw is applied as written.  We find nothing clearly erroneous in this finding.  Assuming, arguendo, 
however, that the restriction is confined to products trademarked by Topco, the result in this case would not change."
47,7," When the Government first raised this point in the District Court, Topco objected on the ground that it was at variance with the 
charge in the complaint.  The District Court apparently agreed with Topco that the complaint did not cover customer limitations, 
but permitted the Government to pursue this line on the basis that if the limitations were proved, the complaint could later be 
amended.  App. 141.  Topco acquiesced in this procedure, and both sides dealt with customer limitations in examining 
witnesses.  The District Court made specific findings and conclusions with respect to the totality of the restraints on wholesaling.  
In light of these facts, the additional fact that the complaint was never formally amended should not bar our consideration of the 
issue. "
48,8," The District Court recognized that ""the government has introduced evidence indicating that some applications by Topco 
members to expand into territories assigned to other members have been denied,"" 319 F.Supp. 1031, 1042, but concluded that 
these decisions by Topco did not have an appreciable influence on the decision of members as to whether or not to expand.  
Topco expands on this conclusion in its brief by asserting that ""the evidence is uncontradicted that a member has never failed to 
build a new store because it was unable to obtain a license."" Brief for Appellee 18 n. 18.  The problem with the conclusion of the 
District Court and the assertion by Topco is that they are wholly inconsistent with the notion that territorial divisions are crucial to 
the existence of Topco, as urged by the association and found by the District Court.  From the filing of its answer to the 
argument before this Court, Topco has maintained that without a guarantee of an exclusive territory, prospective licensees would 
not join Topco and present licensees would leave the association.  It is difficult to understand how Topco can make this 
argument and simultaneously urge that territorial restrictions are an unimportant factor in the decision of a member on whether 
to expand its business. "
49,9," It is true that in Sealy the Court dealt with price fixing as well as territorial restrictions.  To the extent that Sealy casts doubt on 
whether horizontal territorial limitations, unaccompanied by price fixing, are per se violations of the Sherman Act, we remove that 
doubt today."
49,10," There has been much recent commentary on the wisdom of per se rules.  See, e. g., Comment, Horizontal Territorial 
Restraints and the Per Se Rule, 28 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 457 (1971); Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and Sherman One: An Analysis and 
Prognosis, 15 N. Y. L. F. 39 (1969); Note, Selected Antitrust Problems of the Franchisor: Exclusive Arrangements, Territorial 
Restrictions, and Franchise Termination, 22 U. Fla. L. Rev. 260, 286 (1969); Sadd, Antitrust Symposium: Territorial and 
Customer Restrictions After Sealy and Schwinn, 38 U. Cin. L. Rev. 249, 252-253 (1969); Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per 
Se Concept, pt. 1, Price Fixing and Market Division, 74 Yale L. J. 775 (1965). Without the per se rules, businessmen would be left with little to aid them in predicting in any particular case what courts will find 
to be legal and illegal under the Sherman Act. Should Congress ultimately determine that predictability is unimportant in this 
area of the law, it can, of course, make per se rules inapplicable in some or all cases, and leave courts free to ramble through 
the wilds of economic theory in order to maintain a flexible approach. "
52,1," The District Court's findings of fact include the following: ""33. A competitively effective private label program to be independently undertaken by a single retailer or chain would require an 
annual sales volume of $ 250 million or more and in order to achieve optimum efficiency, the volume required would probably 
have to be twice that amount."" 319 F.Supp. 1031, 1036."
52,2," There is dictum in the case to the effect that United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271 (CA6 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 
211 (1899), established a ""division of markets"" as unlawful in and of itself.  356 U.S., at 5. As I will show, however, Addyston 
Pipe established no such thing; it was primarily a price-fixing case."
52,3," I cannot agree with the Court's description of Sealy as being ""on all fours with this case."" Ante, at 609.  Sealy does support the 
proposition that the restraints on the Topco licensees are horizontally imposed.  Beyond that, however, Sealy is hardly 
controlling here.  The territorial restrictions in Sealy were found by this Court to be so intimately a part of an unlawful price-fixing 
and policing scheme that the two arrangements fell together: "
53,," ""This unlawful resale price-fixing activity refutes appellee's claim that the territorial restraints were mere incidents of a lawful 
program of trademark licensing.  Cf. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, [341 U.S. 593 (1951)]. The territorial restraints 
were a part of the unlawful price-fixing and policing."" 388 U.S., at 356."
53,4," In summarizing its findings, the District Court made the following statements: ""When the story is seen as a whole, there is no blinking the fact that there is no free commerce in titanium.  Every pound of it is 
trammelled by privately imposed regulation.  The channels of this commerce have not been formed by the winds and currents of 
competition.  They are, in large measure, artificial canals privately constructed. . . . . . . . "". . . No titanium pigments enter the United States except with the consent of NL [defendant National Lead].  No foreign titanium 
pigments move in interstate commerce except with like approval.  No titanium pigment produced by NL may leave the ports of 
the United States for points outside the Western Hemisphere."" 63 F.Supp. 513, 521-522."
53,5," The District Court clearly decided the case under the ""rule of reason."" It found that there was ""a combination and conspiracy in 
restraint of trade; and the restraint is unreasonable.  As such it is outlawed by Section 1 of the Sherman Act."" 63 F.Supp., at 523 
(emphasis added).  The court rejected the argument made by the defense that the basic agreement on which the arrangement 
was founded was permissible under ""the doctrine which validates covenants in restraint of trade when reasonably ancillary to a 
lawful principal purpose . . . .  The world-wide territorial allocation was unreasonable in scope when measured against the 
business actualities."" Id., at 524 (emphasis added)."
53,6," ""The appellees did not appeal from the findings and order invalidating [territorial] restraints on resale by distributors. . . ."" 388 
U.S., at 368."
53,7," ""The Government does not contend that a per se violation of the Sherman Act is presented by the practices which are involved 
in this appeal . . . .  Accordingly, we are remitted to an appraisal of the market impact of these practices. "". . . We must look to the specifics of the challenged practices and their impact upon the marketplace in order to make a 
judgment as to whether the restraint is or is not 'reasonable' in the special sense in which § 1 of the Sherman Act must be read 
for purposes of this type of inquiry."" 388 U.S., at 373-374."
53,8," ""We are here confronted with challenged vertical restrictions as to territory and dealers. . . .  These are not horizontal restraints, 
in which the actors are distributors with or without the manufacturer's participation."" 388 U.S., at 372. "
54,9," Among the facts found by the District Court are the following: private-label brand merchandising, which is beyond the reach of 
the small chains acting independently and which by definition depends upon local exclusivity, permits the merchandiser to offer 
the public ""lower consumer prices on products of high quality"" and ""to bargain more favorably with national brand 
manufacturers""; such merchandising fosters ""the establishment of a broader supply base of manufacturers, thereby decreasing 
dependence upon a relatively few, large national brand manufacturers""; it also enables ""smaller manufacturers, the most 
common source of private label products, who are generally unable to develop national brand name recognition for their 
products, [to] benefit . . . by the assurance of a substantial market for their products. . . ."" 319 F.Supp., at 1035. "
55,10," It seems ironical to me that in another antitrust case decided today, Ford Motor Co. v. United States, ante, p. 562, the Court, in 
contrast to its handling of the instant case, goes out of its way to commend another District Court for its treatment of a problem 
involving ""predictions and assumptions concerning future economic and business events."" Id., at 578."
55,11," The national chains market their own private-label products, and these products are available nowhere else than in the stores 
of those chains. The stores of any one chain, of course, do not engage in price competition with each other with respect to their 
chain's private-label brands, and no serious suggestion could be made that the Sherman Act requires otherwise.  I fail to see 
any difference whatsoever in the economic effect of the Topco arrangement for the marketing of Topco-brand products and the 
methods used by the national chains in marketing their private-label brands. True, the Topco arrangement involves a 
""combination,"" while each of the national chains is a single integrated corporation.  The controlling consideration, however, 
should be that in neither case is the policy of the Sherman Act offended, for the practices in both cases work to the benefit, and 
not to the detriment, of the consuming public. "

64,2," Senator Kefauver offered the following definition in the Senate debates: What is a dual-rate contract? Essentially, it is an exclusive patronage contract whereby a shipper -- or consignee -- 
promises to transport all of the cargo under his control, between ports within the scope of a steamship conference 
agreement, aboard vessels belonging to that conference.  Shippers who do not sign such an agreement are assessed a 
rate, called the noncontract rate, substantially above the so-called contract rate which is available to signatories.  In its most 
elemental terms, the dual-rate contract is nothing but an exclusive dealing arrangement in which signatory shippers are 
given preferential treatment while those unwilling to be bound are penalized by higher rates. Index to Legislative History of Steamship Conference Dual Rate Law, S. Doc. No. 100, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 292 (1962)."

four major respects. (1) The House bill declared exclusive patronage shipping contracts between carriers and shippers to be prohibited except 
upon prior approval by the appropriate Federal Government agency (now Federal Maritime Commission) and required that 
the use of such contracts by steamship conferences or individual steamship companies could be approved only if they met 
certain specified criteria and standards.  The bill as it passed the Senate eliminated the prohibition language and 
affirmatively permitted the use of dual rate, or exclusive patronage, contracts. (2) The bill as it passed the House made it mandatory that all criteria be affirmatively met before the use of exclusive 
patronage contracts would be permitted and conference agreements approved by the Commission.  The Senate version 
would permit the use of exclusive patronage contracts unless the Commission made findings to the contrary. (3) The bill as it passed the House contained several major provisions intended to protect the status of independent carriers 
who might choose not to join a conference but which would, at the same time, give the conferences full and fair opportunity 
to operate with effective dual-rate systems.  The bill as it passed the Senate, for the most part eliminated all such provisions 
of an antitrust nature. (4) The bill as it passed the House provided that conferences of carriers or individual carriers operating in the foreign 
commerce of the United States must designate persons upon whom service of process may be made within the United 
States and provide records or other information, wherever located, required by any order of the Commission.  These 
features were stricken from the bill in the Senate version. As agreed upon, by the conferees, the bill in major respects conforms with the Senate approach on the foregoing points. Index to Legislative History, supra, note 2, at 444."

72,33," See H. Rep. No. 498, supra, note 22, at 18 where the Federal Maritime Board expressed its dissatisfaction with the positive 
finding requirement, particularly with respect to § 15. At page 4, lines 15 and 16, we recommend that the words ""that it affirmatively finds to be in the public interest"" be stricken.  
In conformity with other similar statutes, such as the Aviation Act of 1958, we believe that, if a public interest standard is to 
be applied by the Board, it should be phrased in terms of permitting the approval of agreements which the Board does not 
find to be adverse to the public interest. See 49 U.S.C. 1382(b).  Requiring a positive finding in favor of the public interest 
would prevent carriers from operating under arrangements which, although not meriting disapproval under the standards of 
the statute, could not be shown to positively contribute to the public interest."

72,2," .  In view of the [nine] specific safeguards which must be in dual-rate contracts before the Commission may approve them, 
must the Commission also be required to make findings, based on substantial evidence, that the contracts are not (1) "
73,," detrimental to the commerce of the United States, or (2) contrary to the public interest, or (3) unjustly discriminatory or 
unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign 
competitors? In addition to [nine] specific safeguards which must be in each dual-rate contract, the bill as it passed the House would 
require the Commission to find that the contract was (1) not intended to or reasonably likely to cause the exclusion of any 
other carrier from the trade, (2) not detrimental to the commerce of the United States, and (3) not contrary to the public 
interest. Your committee concluded that in order for the Commission to make these additional findings, the parties applying for 
permission to use dual-rate contracts would have to build extensive records before the Commission, even though there 
might be no opposition to the contracts, and even though they might clearly contain the [nine] matters expressly required by

75,48," Petitioners urge that Svenska has no application to the instant case since in Svenska, unlike the case sub judice, there was 
opposition to the proposed contracts and allegations of harm.  We find no such limitation express or implied in Svenska.  
Furthermore, the point is not so much who or how many are opposed to the contract, but rather what are the legitimate 
commercial objectives to be achieved by the proposal."
75,49," As the Commission indicated one could conclude from the testimony that the advantages were due to establishment of the 
conference system just as easily as due to the petitioners' contract rate system.  The Commission offered the following 
illustrative testimony. Q.  Mr. Flook, you have been a party to, signatory to the dual rate contract since 1961? A.  Yes. Q.  And you indicate in your written testimony that it has been your experience that the rate agreement covering the three 
southbound and two northbound has resulted in improved service; is that correct? A.  Yes. Q.  On the part of the Conference? A.  Yes. Q.  What are you comparing that to? A.  Well, we are comparing that to the previous system where there were 10 individual rate agreements. Q.  So since the Federal Maritime Commission's approval of the super conferences, we might call it, you have gotten better 
service? A.  We have, yes. Q.  In your opinion, is this attributable to the amalgamation of separate conferences into one? A.  Yes, it is an ability by the Conference, I feel, to better structure rates. Q.  I don't understand that. A.  Well, with the Conference controlling the five different trade areas, three southbound and two northbound, we feel that it 
offers the lines a greater opportunity through the participation of the European lines that do service the area, to offer better 
service both north and southbound. "
76,," Q.  When you say better service, can you be a little bit more specific there? A.  Well, as you perhaps know, there are several European lines which are carrying cargo from Europe to the Pacific Coast 
and they stop in on the way to Central America. Q.  And those European lines are members of the Conference? A.  Yes, and they bring cargo up to the United States, so we have the additional sailings which offer us more flexibility in 
bringing us cocoa beans at the time we need it, up to the United States. Q.  And prior to the approval of the super conference, the European lines were precluded from stopping into those Central 
American areas? A.  They were not precluded that I recall, but they did not offer it on a scheduled basis. Q.  More specifically, how has the imposition of the dual rate agreement increased the service to you?  The dual rate 
agreement is completely apart from the approval of the Conference rate? A.  No, no.  The dual rate agreement, in my opinion, offers to the line the opportunity to be assured of sufficient patronage 
which would justify the scheduling of vessels at regular intervals, and the receivers benefit through this scheduling. Q.  Has service increased from the time when the dual rate agreement was initially imposed on all areas? A.  It would be very difficult to answer that question because the service is dictated by the amount of cargo offerings.  It may 
have decreased in the number of sailings both to the United States and from the United States on the Pacific Coast, but 
that might be due to the overall reduction in the volume of cargo moving and not attributable to the difference in the 
Conference structure today on what it was previously. Q.  Has there, in fact, been a diminution of service? A.  Not within the last two or three years I would say.  Previous to that, I think, there were more sailings, yes. Q.  And what has accounted for the diminution of service? A.  As I said before, I think it is due to the lesser volume of cargo moving into these areas.  I think there has been a greater 
industrialization in Latin America, and as a result it has affected some of the movement from the Pacific Coast of 
manufactured items. J.A. 167-68."
76,50," The Commission cites the following example: Mr. M.J. McCarthy, of the Freight Forwarders Association, stated that he had been in the shipping business for 41 years, and 
that this present contract system ""better affords stability of rates"", and that without the present contract system there would be 
no rate stability.  When Hearing Counsel asked whether the shipper should have the option of shipping conference or non-
Conference, Mr. McCarthy stated: If you put it that way, Mr. Tell, forget about the Conference, just break them up and forget about it if you're going to give the 
latitude where he can ship conference or non-Conference.  If he has that latitude, I see no reason why he should have a 
Conference.  Why don't you walk right into a rate war? J.A. 170. "

successful efforts by members of an automobile dealers' association to persuade, inter alia, the executive director of the 
Oklahoma State Motor Vehicle Commission to seek an injunction, which was subsequently obtained, to restrain a used car 
dealer from selling new cars without a license (required under Oklahoma law).  The Tenth Circuit sustained the trial court's 
holding that the defendants by invoking state action had acted validly and in accord with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  After 
reviewing the recent decision of the Supreme Court in California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, infra, note 20, the 
Tenth Circuit held that case inapposite to Semke, stating that ""[California Motor Transport] does not aid the plaintiff at bar 
because it has not been shown here that defendants were guilty of fraud, corruption or misuse of the state processes."" (At 
1366). As such, Semke differs from the case at bar in that the plaintiffs here assert that the defendants, who include an official of the 
FDA, in fact ""misused"" the FDA processes by influencing the agency to deny fair consideration of the new drug application filed 
by plaintiffs for their drug Cothyrobal (See supra for a description of these allegations).  In contrast, in Semke the defendants 
sought, albeit in their own interest, to have the Oklahoma statute requiring one who sells new cars in the state to obtain a license 
enforced against the plaintiff."

85,14," This cause of action was transferred from the court of then District Judge Ingraham to another District Judge as a docket 
equalization measure in 1966."
85,15," Judge Ingraham recognized the inapplicability of Noerr to the situation presented by Woods Exploration: Is the conduct complained of political in nature?  If the defendants were enjoined from conspiring to submit false 
nominations to the Railroad Commission would they be deprived of any Constitutional right to petition or participate in the 
governmental process?  The answer clearly seems to be that the defendants would only be prohibited from undertaking "
86,," certain joint business behavior.  To subject them to liability under the Sherman Act for conspiring to restrict production or to 
eliminate a competitor would effectuate the purposes of the Sherman Act and would not remotely infringe upon any of the 
constitutionally protected freedoms spoken of in Noerr. "

86,19," The issuance of patents provides a close analogy to the approval of drugs by the FDA.  In a recent commentary on the 
antitrust implications of issuing patents, Van Cise notes: Should the purpose of the applicant be to obtain a patent by fraud, . . . substantial antitrust issues may be raised.  The main 
purpose of the applicant, then, would not be to disclose some new advance in science or the useful arts, but rather by 
deception to exclude others from access to a product or process which all should be free to enjoy. As pointed out in Walker 
Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation, 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 
(1965): ""Proof of this assertion would be sufficient to strip . . . [a patentee] of its exemption from the antitrust laws. . . ."" . . . An intent by a patent applicant through agreement to obtain a patent claim to which he might not be otherwise entitled 
could constitute an attempt to restrain or monopolize, not by reason of a reward from the Government for an advance in 
technology, but solely because of this agreement.  As Mr. Justice White emphasized in his concurring opinion in United 
States v. Singer Manufacturing Company, 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct. 1773 (1963), any such conduct would 
improperly subordinate, to private ends: ""the public interest in granting patent monopolies only when the progress of the 
useful arts and of science will be furthered."" Van Cise, ""Patents, Plowshares and Pruning Hooks,"" 57 A.B.A.J. 1100, 1101 (1971). "

175-177, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965); and that conspiracy with a licensing authority to eliminate a competitor may

87,23," Mr. Justice Stewart, with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joined, concurred in the result reached by the majority.  He observed: 
""Under [their] allegations, liberally construed, the respondents are entitled to prove that the real intent of the conspirators was not 
to invoke the processes of the administrative agencies and courts, but to discourage and ultimately to prevent the respondents 
from invoking those processes.  Such an intent would [come within the ""sham"" exception in Noerr]."" Id., at 4156."

issue [to the District Court] for an evidentiary determination of whether or not defendants in fact filed false nominations, and, if 
so, what damages plaintiffs sustained therefrom."" 438 F.2d at 1298."
87,26," It is appropriate to have plaintiffs reactivate their last-filed application rather than file a new one, since their allegations of 
antitrust violations are made in reference to FDA treatment of their prior applications. "

the FDA to approve Cothyrobal is not the complaint; the complaint is, the conspiratorial activities of Appellees have been such "

from the legal situation in Seatrain Lines, Inc. v. Federal Maritime Commission and United States of America, 148 U.S. App. 
D.C. 424, 460 F.2d 932 (1972), where the ground of our holding that the FMC lacked jurisdiction over the contract involved was 
the absence of the requisite statutory grant of authority, especially as viewed in the light of overall antitrust policy.  Here there is 
no question raised as to the authority of the FDA to pass upon the drug, but FDA consideration is linked to plaintiffs' antitrust 
conspiracy allegations, clearly a matter ultimately cognizable by the District Court. "
90,34," 432 F.2d 1155 (7th Cir. 1970). One Commissioner, whose vote was necessary to the 3-2 decision to bring a complaint, voted 
for it on the stated theory he had no discretion to act otherwise.  Similarly, on more than one occasion this court has reversed a 
trial court when the trial judge clearly indicated he had misconstrued the extent of his discretion.  United States v. Waters, 141 
U.S. App. D.C. 289, 437 F.2d 722 (1970); United States v. Ward, 147 U.S. App. D.C. 149, 454 F.2d 992 (1971)."
90,35," Although we have spoken of a ""full hearing"" and a ""trial de novo"" in the District Court, if plaintiffs seek one after FDA final 
action occurs, the extent to which the parties introduce original evidence or rely upon the record made in the FDA proceeding 
rests largely in the good judgment of the District Court.  The essential is that the plaintiffs have a full and fair presentation of all 
their contentions before an impartial tribunal. As this court noted in a similar case: The District Court should retain jurisdiction of the antitrust suit while appellant seeks his remedies from the [Civil 
Aeronautics Board]. . . . The District Court . . . will have the benefit of these proceedings in determining the issue of antitrust 
violation.  Whatever damages might ultimately be awarded by it would be damages for violation of the antitrust laws, not the 
Civil Aeronautics Act.  Similarly, whatever injunctive relief is ultimately granted by the District Court with regard to matters 
determined by the Board to fall outside its jurisdiction would be under the antitrust laws, not the Civil Aeronautics Act.  S.S.W., Inc. v. Air Transport Ass'n of America, 89 U.S. App. D.C. 273, 280, 191 F.2d 658, 664 (1951). "

108,1," Peter Calabrese died after the conclusion of the trial.  On July 6, 1971, Adele Calabrese, as executrix of his estate, was 
substituted as a defendant in his stead on the motion of the plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 25, F.R. Civ. P."
108,2," The record is not precisely clear as to why the union took this action.  Apparently there were at least two factors involved: (a) 
complaints from the other union members that the owner-drivers worked too cheaply and thereby deprived the other men of 
work; and, (b) unspecified antitrust problems involved in organizing both truck drivers and truck owners. "
109,3, In 1966 Thornwood negotiated with Calabrese about signing a contract with the union.  This negotiation will be described infra. 
110,4," The record shows that between 1960 and 1969 the total amount of fines imposed by the union was $19,771.83.  None of the 
contractors who were fined have joined in this action, nor, apparently, have any of them brought any action at all protesting the 
fines imposed upon them.  Still, it is not out of place to note that it has been held by a state court that a strike to enforce a fine 
payable to a charity is unlawful.  Building Trades Council v. Thompson, 68 Nev. 384, 234 P.2d 581 (1951). "
112,5," The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, originally cited in the complaint, refers to the activities of a labor 
organization under trusteeship.  The new citation is to that provision which makes it unlawful for a labor organization to engage 
in unfair labor practices."
112,6," Plaintiffs also moved for leave to conform their complaint to the evidence by labelling a cause of action for economic duress 
and by labelling the fines imposed by the union as extortion in violation of the New York Penal Law.  However, inasmuch as 
plaintiffs did not argue in their concluding oral argument or in their post-trial brief economic duress or extortion as separate, 
independent claims, the court treats these theories simply as additional arguments made by plaintiffs in support of their various 
claims.  Hence, a separate ruling on this part of plaintiffs' motion to conform their pleadings to the evidence is not indicated."
112,7," HN1[
] Rule 15(b) Fed. R. Civ. P. reads as follows: Amendments to Conform to the Evidence.  When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of 
the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.  Such amendment of the pleadings 
as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any 
party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.  If evidence 
is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to 
be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting 
party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon 
the merits.  The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence. "
114,8," No contention has been made that the alleged secondary employers, that is, the construction contractors who employed Iodice 
and consequently were threatened and fined, were not engaged in an industry affecting commerce or that the effect of the 
alleged secondary activities did not burden or obstruct commerce.  See NLRB v. International Union of Operating Engineers, 
Local 571, 317 F.2d 638, 642-43 (8th Cir. 1963); Sheet Metal Workers International Ass'n. Local 299 and Allen Stout, 131 NLRB 
147 (1961). Iodice himself made moves into New Jersey and Connecticut.  See, Herbert Burman, Inc. v. Local 3 International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 214 F. Supp. 353, 357 (S.D. N.Y. 1963)."
114,9," Plaintiffs construe Iodice's testimony differently, arguing that all Iodice said was that Pelham's wage costs in 1965 were about 
twenty percent greater than his own labor costs were in 1963.  Whatever Iodice's disputed statement was intended to mean, the 
record does reflect that both Tramonti and Nicolai were paid more in 1965 when they transferred from Thornwood to Pelham and 
joined the union. "
115,10," It should be noted that there was much testimony in this case concerning the events surrounding Calabrese's trial for assault.  
More particularly, Iodice and Valentine testified about an attempt made by Calabrese's wife, friends and attorney before the trial 
to persuade Iodice and Valentine to change their testimony in Calabrese's favor.  In response the defendants placed on the 
stand various witnesses who denied that any such attempt occurred.  Some of these witnesses testified instead that after the 
trial Iodice and Valentine admitted to Mrs. Calabrese that they had lied.  Also, Iodice testified that just before entering the 
courtroom where Calabrese was to be tried, Calabrese told him ""I will get you if it is the last thing I do."" (Transcript, p. 491). "
116,," Calabrese denied making the statement.  Resolution of the unhappy factual questions raised here is not required for purposes of 
this opinion.  Suffice it to say, whatever happened, Calabrese's ill feeling towards Iodice cannot be gainsaid."
116,11," Calabrese denied making these statements, but considering his admitted feelings towards Iodice, the record as a whole, and 
the demeanor of these witnesses, the court finds that the testimony summarized in the text is credible and the court accepts it. "
117,12," Two other Supreme Court decisions relevant to federal pre-emption in this area are San Diego Building Trades Council v. 
Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775, 79 S. Ct. 773 (1959), and Local 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, 
Warehousemen & Helpers v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 3 L. Ed. 2d 312, 79 S. Ct. 297 (1959). "
118,13," No contention has been made that Pelham, a company which had a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by 
the Interstate Commerce Commission and which sent its truck across state lines, was not in an industry affecting interstate 
commerce."
118,14," Calabrese testified that before the strike he called Pelham at least a half dozen times about its delinquency, speaking when he 
called to Iodice or whoever answered the telephone.  There was no direct contradiction of this testimony although Ruggiero 
testified that before the strike he never received a complaint from the union about Pelham's failure to make the required 
payments. "
119,15," In connection with their breach of contract claim, plaintiffs argue based on New York law that defendants committed a prima 
facie tort in calling the strike against Pelham. HN6[
] When compatible with the purposes of federal labor law, state law may be looked to for guidance in fashioning the rules 
to be applied in the federal sphere.  Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 457, 1 L. Ed. 2d 972, 77 S. Ct. 912 
(1957). Prima facie tort theory certainly could play a salutary role in federal labor law in cases where a union and its officials 
abuse their positions of trust and responsibility.  Therefore, this court would invoke prima facie tort doctrine as a basis for 
recovery where appropriate. Here, however, while the court has no hesitation in finding that Calabrese's animus towards Iodice also was directed at Iodice's 
friend, Ruggiero, and that Calabrese's actions towards Pelham were motivated by malice, the court cannot find that the strike 
against Pelham was conducted solely for the purpose of injuring it.  Hence plaintiffs have not made out a case of prima facie tort "
120,," under New York law.  E.g., Reinforce, Inc. v. Birney, 308 N.Y. 164, 124 N.E. 2d 104 (1954); Schisgall v. Fairchild Publications, 
Inc., 207 Misc. 224, 137 N.Y.S. 2d 312 (Sup. Ct. 1955)."

] A preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof to be applied in Sherman Act suits against labor unions. Ramsey v. United Mine Workers of America, 401 U.S. 302, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64, 91 S. Ct. 658 (1971). The ""clear and convincing 
proof"" required by section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act relates only to a union's ratification or authorization of the alleged 
unlawful conduct performed on its behalf.  The Court stated that section 6 is not addressed to the quantum of evidence required 
to prove the occurrence of the alleged ""unlawful acts."" "
123,20," The court's use of the term ""gross profits"" is predicated solely upon its employment by the parties at trial and in their post trial 
papers.  Its use in this text is not in recognition of its legal significance or an acknowledgment of its established place in 
accounting lexicon, but merely for purposes of consistency. In this action the term ""gross profits"" has been used to refer to the difference between revenue received from services rendered 
(i.e. ""business done"") and the costs involved in providing that service.  Succinctly stated, as used herein ""gross profit"" equals 
revenue minus costs. "

149,1," The reserve system, publicly introduced into baseball contracts in 1887, see Metropolitan Exhibition Co. v.  Ewing, 42 F. 198, 
202-204 (CC SDNY 1890), centers in the uniformity of player contracts; the confinement of the player to the club that has him 
under the contract; the assignability of the player's contract; and the ability of the club annually to renew the contract unilaterally, 
subject to a stated salary minimum.  Thus A. Rule 3 of the Major League Rules provides in part: ""(a) UNIFORM CONTRACT.  To preserve morale and to produce the similarity of conditions necessary to keen competition, the 
contracts between all clubs and their players in the Major Leagues shall be in a single form which shall be prescribed by the 
Major League Executive Council.  No club shall make a contract different from the uniform contract or a contract containing a 
non-reserve clause, except with the written approval of the Commissioner. . . . . . . . ""(g) TAMPERING.  To preserve discipline and competition, and to prevent the enticement of players, coaches, managers and 
umpires, there shall be no negotiations or dealings respecting employment, either present or prospective, between any player, 
coach or manager and any club other than the club with which he is under contract or acceptance of terms, or by which he is 
reserved, or which has the player on its Negotiation List, or between any umpire and any league other than the league with 
which he is under contract or acceptance of terms, unless the club or league with which he is connected shall have, in writing, 
expressly authorized such negotiations or dealings prior to their commencement.""B. Rule 9 of the Major League Rules provides 
in part: ""(a) NOTICE.  A club may assign to another club an existing contract with a player. The player, upon receipt of written notice of 
such assignment, is by his contract bound to serve the assignee. . . . . ""After the date of such assignment all rights and obligations of the assignor clubs thereunder shall become the rights and 
obligations of the assignee club . . . .""C. Rules 3 and 9 of the Professional Baseball Rules contain provisions parallel to those 
just quoted. D. The Uniform Player's Contract provides in part: ""4. (a) . . . The Player agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the Club shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief 
to prevent a breach of this contract by the Player, including, among others, the right to enjoin the Player from playing baseball for 
any other person or organization during the term of this contract."" ""5. (a) The Player agrees that, while under contract, and prior to expiration of the Club's right to renew this contract, he will not 
play baseball otherwise than for the Club, except that the Player may participate in post-season games under the conditions 
prescribed in the Major League Rules. . . ."" ""6. (a) The Player agrees that this contract may be assigned by the Club (and reassigned by any assignee Club) to any other 
Club in accordance with the Major League Rules and the Professional Baseball Rules."" "
150,," ""10. (a) On or before January 15 (or if a Sunday, then the next preceding business day) of the year next following the last playing 
season covered by this contract, the Club may tender to the Player a contract for the term of that year by mailing the same to the 
Player at his address following his signature hereto, or if none be given, then at his last address of record with the Club. If prior 
to the March 1 next succeeding said January 15, the Player and the Club have not agreed upon the terms of such contract, then 
on or before 10 days after said March 1, the Club shall have the right by written notice to the Player at said address to renew this 
contract for the period of one year on the same terms, except that the amount payable to the Player shall be such as the club 
shall fix in said notice; provided, however, that said amount, if fixed by a Major League Club, shall be an amount payable at a 
rate not less than 80% of the rate stipulated for the preceding year. ""(b) The Club's right to renew this contract, as provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 10, and the promise of the Player 
not to play otherwise than with the Club have been taken into consideration in determining the amount payable under paragraph 
2 hereof."""

professional sports is 'unrealistic,' 'inconsistent' and 'illogical.' . . .  While we should not fall out of our chairs with surprise at the

155,10," ""What really saved baseball, legally at least, for the next half century was the protective canopy spread over it by the United 
States Supreme Court's decision in the Baltimore Federal League anti-trust suit against Organized Baseball in 1922.  In it 
Justice Holmes, speaking for a unanimous court, ruled that the business of giving baseball exhibitions for profit was not 'trade or 
commerce in the commonly-accepted use of those words' because 'personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of 
commerce'; nor was it interstate, because the movement of ball clubs across state lines was merely 'incidental' to the business.  
It should be noted that, contrary to what many believe, Holmes did call baseball a business; time and again those who have not 
troubled to read the text of the decision have claimed incorrectly that the court said baseball was a sport and not a business."" 2

163,2," As MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN points out, the reserve system is not novel.  It has been employed since 1887.  See 
Metropolitan Exhibition Co. v.  Ewing, 42 F. 198, 202-204 (CC SDNY 1890). The club owners assert that it is necessary to 
preserve effective competition and to retain fan interest.  The players do not agree and argue that the reserve system is overly "
164,," restrictive.  Before this lawsuit was instituted, the players refused to agree that the reserve system should be a part of the 
collective-bargaining contract.  Instead, the owners and players agreed that the reserve system would temporarily remain in 
effect while they jointly investigated possible changes.  Their activity along these lines has halted pending the outcome of this 
suit."
164,3," Petitioner also alleged a violation of state antitrust laws, state civil rights laws, and of the common law, and claimed that he was

Because I believe that federal antitrust laws govern baseball, I find that state law has been pre-empted in this area.  Like the 
lower courts, I do not believe that there has been a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. "

States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941). ""The jurist concerned with 'public confidence in, and acceptance of the judicial system' might well consider that, however 
admirable its resolute adherence to the law as it was, a decision contrary to the public sense of justice as it is, operates, so far 
as it is known, to diminish respect for the courts and for law itself."" Szanton, Stare Decisis; A Dissenting View,  10 Hastings L. J.

reported, but retrieved from the files in the Federal Records Center) said (p. 10): ""We feel that in adopting a standard which uses 
the possibility that the ingots could be individually and manually loaded, the Commission has gone beyond the bounds of 
reasonable practicality."" As the Commission accordingly held in Moss Trucking Co., Inc., Investigation of Operations, 103 M.C.C. "
185,91," , 111 (1966): ""any Commission determination that a given commodity is susceptible of handling manually should be premised 
upon record evidence showing that the commodity, in fact, has been or as a practical matter could be handled in that way; an 
abstract possibility of manual handling will not suffice."""

May, 194 U.S. 267, 269, 24 S. Ct. 638, 48 L. Ed. 971 (1904), he said, holding that ""the legislature is the only judge of the policy"" 
to be applied, that ""The question is whether this case lies on one side or the other of a line which has to be worked out between 
cases differing only in degree."" And as he said in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32, 41, 72 L. Ed. 770, 48 S. 
Ct. 423 (1928). ""When a legal distinction is determined, as no one doubts that it may be, between night and day, childhood and 
maturity, or any other extremes, a point has to be fixed or a line has to be drawn, or gradually picked out by successive 
decisions, to mark where the change takes place.  Looked at by itself without regard to the necessity behind it the line or point 
seems arbitrary.  It might as well or nearly as well be a little more to one side or the other.  But when it is seen that a line or point 
there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature must be 
accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark."" See also the comments of Justice Frankfurter in Terry

187,11," Incredible as it seems now, it is an historical fact that originally the Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, 24 Stat. 379 
was ""consumer protection"" legislation, designed to combat the monopoly power of railroads.  Section 5 of the original Act, unlike 
the present language permitting mergers and acquisitions in spite of the Antitrust Laws, forbade pooling of traffic by carriers. 24 
Stat. 380.  This prohibition may be regarded as the beginning of federal antitrust legislation and as a precursor of the Sherman 
Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209.  ""The Sherman Act, with reference to the Commerce Act, is practically supplemental legislation.  
Its effect and operation is to broaden the provisions of Section 5 so as to embrace not only carriers, but manufacturers and 
producers as well."" Snyder, The Interstate Commerce Act and Federal Antitrust Laws (1904) 122."
187,12," Because the Commission's minimum-rate power had been used as an ""umbrella"" to protect high-cost carriers, Congress in 
1958 amended the ""rule of rate-making"" in Section 15a of the Act to curb this tendency of the Commission to keep rates up for 
the benefit of the high-cost carrier. See I.C.C. v. New York N.H. & H.R.R. Co., 372 U.S. 744, 746, 756-59, 83 S. Ct. 1038, 10 L.

consideration by the Commission.  Lang Transportation Corp. v. U.S., 75 F. Supp. 915, 929 (S.D. Cal. Central Div. 1948)."
188,18," See, e. g., I.C.C. v. Parker, 326 U.S. 60, 65, 89 L. Ed. 2051, 65 S. Ct. 1490 (1945), referred to in note 10 supra.  This function 
is a basic task of the administrative agency supervising any regulated industry.  In Federal Communications Commission v. 
Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 140, 145-46, 84 L. Ed. 656, 60 S. Ct. 437 (1940), the Supreme Court held that it was 
for the Commission to decide which of several rival radio stations should be preferred. "
189,19," This rule applies if conventional vehicles suffice for the over-the-road haul, and special equipment is needed only for loading 
or unloading. This so-called ""twilight zone"" was established in National Automobile Transporters Assn. v. Rowe Transfer, 64 
M.C.C. 229, 240 (1955). See 108 M.C.C. at 723. A fortiori, a general commodities hauler may handle shipments which are 
heavy only because they are bundled into large packages if the loading and unloading is done by the shipper or consignee 
rather than the carrier."
189,20," There appears to be adequate rational justification for the Rowe ruling since all that the carrier there furnished was ordinary 
over-the-road movement in a conventional vehicle.  The carrier used no special equipment.  Certificate restrictions are 
addressed to the carrier, not the shipper. In any event, the situation in the case at bar is not the Rowe situation, but what has 
been called ""aggregated"" shipments. 108 M.C.C. at 724."
189,21," Since the Commission's action involved nothing but genuine interpretation of the certificates, there is no point to plaintiffs' 
contentions that the procedure for ""revocation"" of a certificate or for ""rule-making"" should have been followed. "
190,22," The Commission's interpretation of its own work product should be at least as authoritative as the views of the early English 
judge who took part in the enactment of the statute of Westminster II.  In 1305 Hengham, C.J. said to counsel: ""Ne glosez point 
le statut; nous le savons meinz de vous, quar nous le feimes."" Holdsworth, A History of English Law, II, 308 (1923)."
190,23, 108 M.C.C. at 717.
190,24," 108 M.C.C. at 725, 738-38. Likewise the word ""require"" indicates that special equipment is needed to handle a shipment, not 
merely that in fact it was used.  Of course, absolute impossibility to move the commodities without such equipment need not be 
proved in order to show that it was ""required."" See Marshall's exegesis of ""necessary and proper"" in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 
U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 413-14, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819); and tax cases involving deductibility of ""ordinary and necessary expenses""

192,34," 2 M.C.C. at 706-708. The class was at first designated as "" Carriers of heavy machinery."" This group includes carriers, both common and contract, engaged in the hauling of heavy machinery and equipment, 
including road machinery, structural steel, oil-field rigs, and oil-field equipment.  These commodities are grouped together 
because of the equipment required and the nature of the service performed . . . Certain auxiliary or accessorial services are 
also performed in the transportation of these commodities, such as the dismantling and resetting of machinery, often 
requiring the use of rigging, skidding, and similar devices. Later the description was phrased in terms of the type of service performed, requiring special equipment either for loading, 
unloading, or over-the-road movement.  Osborne Common Carrier Application -- Heavy Materials, 47 M.C.C. 633, 640 (1948);

268-70 (1952)."
192,35," Heavy haulage was one of the ""usual exceptions"" specified in the certificates of carriers of general commodities. The other 
usual exceptions are commodities of unusual value, explosives, household goods, commodities in bulk, or those injurious or 
contaminating to other lading.  See Ex. 10 and 17, and 61 M.C.C. at 216."
192,36," It should be emphasized that the testimony in the present record shows that most industries have loading docks (Tr. 439, 
447); that some of the particular shippers here involved who use power equipment do not have docks (Tr. 43, 51, 289) and that 
they use such equipment for reasons of economy and efficiency, rather than because it is needed by the nature of the 
commodity (Tr. 30, 32, 88, 279); and that they use the same equipment to load vehicles of general commodities carriers which 
they use to load those of heavy haulers (Tr. 50, 59-60, 293). "
193,37," Plaintiffs argue that the criteria enunciated by the Commission are arbitrary because two prior decisions, found inconsistent 
with the general trend and constellation of Commission decisions, were overruled.  108 M.C.C. at 743. To this contention, 
regardless of the merits of the two cases involved, there are three convincing answers: (1) The Commission's decisions are not 
required to be consistent, indeed, one of the supposed advantages of the administrative process is its flexibility and capability of 
adaptation to fluctuating fact-situations, [Virginia Stage Lines v. United States] 48 F. Supp. 79, 83 (W.D. Va. 1942); (2) Courts in 
applying stare decisis do not blindly follow the latest decision if it conflicts with an established doctrinal trend; (3) ""How can what 
an Englishman thinks be heresy?"" How can what the Supreme Court does, with increasing frequency, be arbitrary? "
194,38," There is a hiatus between pages 527 and 613 of the Transcript (hereinafter cited as ""Tr."").  Counsel have explained that by 
agreement the omitted material, dealing with a consolidated separate issue relating to safety regulations, has no bearing on the 
issues pertinent here with respect to interpretation and application of the heavy haulers certificates held by plaintiffs."
194,39," In fact he said ""they were driven onto the trailer under their own power."" This contradicts his later statements that they were 
loaded using a crane (Tr. 18, 29).  He may have meant that they were driven under their own power from the storage area to the 
crane (Tr. 30). "
195,40," Of course automobiles are ordinarily carried in double-decker caravan type trailers, which constitute special equipment; but 
this is not necessarily so. "
196,41," We emphasize again, that bundled pipe can be loaded on vehicles belonging to general commodities carriers. The public 
safety is not endangered by the Commission's order.  The struggle is between two groups of carriers for traffic."
196,42," Ex. 1 states that 50 bundles are palletized, pallet weight 3500 pounds. Disregarding tare weight of the pallet, the bundle of 10 
pieces would weigh 70 pounds. Ex. 1 also states that one sheet weighs 7 pounds, and a bundle of 10 sheets 70 pounds. Ex. 1 is 
a list of shipments compiled for the Bureau of Inquiry before the hearing and subject to verification by witnesses.  Tr. 9."
196,43," The statement is evidently based on ""canned"" testimony submitted by Mr. Doran, president of plaintiff (Ex. 39, pp. 18-19).  The 
Examiner, somewhat capriciously, ruled that the sentence on p. 18 that individual pieces had to be bundled should be stricken 
as self-serving, but that the motion to strike should be denied with respect to the sentence on p. 19 that individual bundles had to "
197,," be further bundled and palletized (Tr. 658).  But even Mr. Doran does not say what a minimum protective bundle would weigh. 
He merely describes what was in fact done."
197,44," In exceptional cases, such as heavy cylindrical bombs (of 500 to 750 pounds) which can be rolled easily, a higher weight limit 
is appropriate.  The Commission's decision in the bomb case was upheld by a three-judge court in Missouri in International 
Transport, Inc. v. U.S., 337 F. Supp. 985 (W.D. Mo. 1972). Assuming the correctness of that decision as a precedent, the 
Commission's decision in the case at bar should be sustained a fortiori. "
199,1," The relevant portions of § 706 are: ""The reviewing courts shall -- (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be -- (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (D) without observance of procedure required by law; (E) unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or otherwise reviewed 
on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or (F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to a trial de novo by the reviewing court."" "
200,2," These considerations apply whether the proceedings involve rule making or adjudication.  In both instances the whole record 
must be canvassed in a searching and careful inquiry to determine whether the agency has reached a reasoned conclusion, 
based on a factual predicate supported by the record, within the applicable statutory authority.  See City of Chicago, Illinois et al. 
v. Federal Power Commission et al., 458 F.2d 731 (C.A.D.C. 1971). "
201,3," The inconsistency of the government's position in the case at bar with that taken in Allegheny Ludlum is dramatically illustrated 
by its argument urged upon, and readily accepted by, the Supreme Court, that the economic effect upon carriers and shippers of 
I.C.C. rules is a factor of relative insignificance.  As I have heretofore observed, the Commission's rules here have all but lost 
sight of the reality of economical and efficient hauling in today's industrialized society.  Moreover, in this case the government 
apparently agrees.  Yet, in the railroad case, at the apparent urging of the government, the Court suggested: ""If, as a result of 
this fact, such roads are placed under economic and competitive pressure to acquire additional freight cars, there is certainly no 
principle of law we know of which would require the Commission to permit them to avoid this economic pressure by continuing to 
borrow freight cars acquired and owned by other lines."" 406 U.S. at 755. The inconsistency in the government's position in Allegheny Ludlum fairly leaps from this statement.  The reference to the 
""principle of law,"" refers not to law in its jurisprudential, but in its economic, sense.  In the geographic confines represented by 
this judicial circuit, 7,209 miles out of the total trackage of 10,422 miles, or 69.2%, is now in bankruptcy -- the Penn Central, 
Central of New Jersey, Lehigh Valley, Reading Railroad, and Lehigh and Hudson River Railroad.  See, 1972 Rail Facts, 
Economic and Financial Division of Association of American Railroads.  To suggest that these roads possess financial resources 
to purchase additional freight cars flaunts the realities evidenced by a score of district court and appellate cases morosely 
demonstrating the acute financial distress of the railroad industry.  To suggest, alternatively, that these roads ""continue to 
borrow"" freight cars owned by other lines is the very practice discouraged by the mandated service rules which now require that 
borrowed cars immediately be returned to the owning lines. "
202,1," Actually, I would go further and remand the case to the Commission, the precedent for which is ample -- United States v. 
Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475, 86 L. Ed. 971, 62 S. Ct. 722 (1942); Justice Frankfurter writing in dissent in 
Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 351 U.S. 321, 100 L. Ed. 1220, 76 S. Ct. 982 (1956);

775, 88 S. Ct. 689 (1968)."
202,2," The fact that in McLean Trucking the Court was confronted with a case involving a merger does not limit its announced 
principles since they obtain, more broadly, where the ""public interest"" needs to be assessed.  See Cities of Statesville v. Atomic 
Energy Commission, 142 U.S. App. D.C. 272, 441 F.2d 962 (1969), in which Judge Leventhal, writing in dissent, observed that, ""The decisions of the Supreme Court and this court over a period of at least 25 years have evolved and defined a 
substantial jurisprudence making clear that the administration of federal regulatory statutes calling for determinations of the 
public interest establish the authority, and in some instances the duty, of the cognizant agency to take into account what 
has been aptly called the nation's 'fundamental national economic policy,' namely the principles of the antitrust laws."" In the case sub judice, involving, statutorily, 49 U.S.C. § 306(a), an assessment of the ""public interest"" is clearly needed."

203,5," The obligation of a regulatory agency to consider the policies of the antitrust laws in determining the public interest was most 
recently reaffirmed in General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. United States, 449 F.2d 846 (5th Cir. 1971) p. 858, citing McLean 
Trucking and Northern Natural. "
207,1," We do not find that this case is similar to Free World Foreign Cars, Inc. v. Alfa Romeo, S.P.A., 55 F.R.D. 26, 1972 Trade Cas. 
(CCH) 73,925 (S.D.N.Y. 1972) cited by defendants.  In Alfa Romeo, the court found that the cost of defending a class action 
might force defendant out of business because defendant had only a small share of the foreign car market.  The court concluded 
that plaintiff, a former franchisee of defendant who was seeking damages for alleged antitrust violations, did not have interests 
co-extensive with present franchisees who depended upon the economic viability of defendant.  We have no evidence in this 
case that the cost of litigating this action as a class action will jeopardize the continued existence of defendants. "

249,16," As indicated hereafter, the court feels it unnecessary to deal at this juncture with assumption 4, since the treatment of 
assumptions 1, 2 and 3 is dispositive of GTE's motion. The court does note that (1) this is a suit against a bona fide holding 
company embracing manufacturing and service companies as well as telephone operating companies, and -- in conscious dicta 
-- (2) the FCC has no antitrust jurisdiction over -- and hence cannot enjoin or undo the operations of -- a holding company, as 
such. "

among these are air carriers subject to the Civil Aeronautics Board and other carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. Both agencies have been given, expressly, broad powers to exempt mergers and acquisitions in whatever form 
from the antitrust laws. See 49 U.S.C. §§ 1378, 1384; 49 U.S.C. § 5(11) and (13). Therefore, the exclusion of assets acquisitions 
in such industries from § 7 would seem to have little significance."" "

324 U.S. at 461-62. In McKeon Construction v. McClatchy Newspapers, 1970 Trade Cas. P 73, 212 (N.D.Calif. 1969), the court indicated begrudging 
acceptance of private divestiture suits under Clayton § 16: ""Injunctions under Section 16 of the Clayton Act are available to prevent only 'threatened loss or damage.' Within such a 
standard, the appropriateness of divestiture appears to fit only a limited number of cases where no other equitable relief is 
available. On the other hand, where a plaintiff alleges a monopoly which restrains trade or commerce, inflicting injury on the 
plaintiff, divestiture may be the only adequate and complete remedy available. I do not believe the court should attempt to 
determine this question on the motion to dismiss."" P 73, 212 at 88, 817. In American Crystal Sugar Co. v. Cuban-American Sugar Co., 152 F. Supp. 387, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 1957), aff'd 259 F.2d 524 (2 Cir. 
1958), the court declared: ""So much of the complaint as seeks a decree directing the defendant to divest itself of stock of the plaintiff company which it may 
now own is not granted in view of the fact that issuance of the injunction as hereinabove directed constitutes an appropriate 
remedy so that divestiture is not necessary."" (Footnote omitted.) See also Crane Co. v. Briggs Mfg. Co., 280 F.2d 747 (6 Cir. 1960); cf.  Muskegon Piston Ring Co. v. Gulf & Western Industries,

Inc., etc., No. 70-2185-R, on June 30, 1972, independently reached the same conclusion as has this court, viz., equitable relief 
by way of divestiture is available to a private litigant under Clayton § 7. See also, Peacock, Private Divestiture Suits Under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 48 Texas L. Rev. 54, 68 (1969); Note, 
Availability of Divestiture in Private Litigation as a Remedy for Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 49 Minn. L. Rev. 267, 
276 n. 55 (1964). GTE has presented two colloquies in House Judiciary Committee Hearings which seem to indicate that at least one member of 
the Committee, as well as one witness before that Committee -- Louis D. Brandeis -- were opposed to private suits for 
dissolution of a corporation. See 1914 Hearings on Trust Legislation before the House Committee of the Judiciary at 649-50, 
842. Even if dissolution of a corporation is the equivalent of divestiture of the parts of a holding company -- see next footnote -- 
this court, acutely aware of the legislative process and the many obstacles a bill must overcome and changes it must undergo 
before emerging as a law, is usually dubious of the worth of any legislative material other than committee reports accompanying 
bills. See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 395-96, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 (1951) (concurring

348,7," One of the bases for the FDIC opinion is that there exists a highly concentrated market in the State of Washington.  Market 
concentration is relative to establishment of the relevant market affected by such merger. The merger in this instance would be 
what is termed a conglomerate merger, since the two institutions are not actual competitors and are in different geographic 
markets.  (Neither has any real services extending into the product area of the other.) The concern becomes one then of 
""potential competition"" under Department of Justice merger guidelines, and this one is far below any set up by that agency.

348,8," Counsel for the FDIC stated to this court on oral argument that the net effect of this decision is that Washington Mutual is 
precluded from any further mergers, except in dire circumstances of imminent collapse, because it is the largest thrift institution

362,7, Professional football enjoys equal coverage but its season is much shorter.
362,8," It may be said that this occurs because it would be both uneconomical and impractical to have two concessionaires in the same 
stadia, arena, etc. because it would require the equipment etc. to be moved in and out of a stadium to serve 8 or 10 football 
games annually or other events that may come to the stadia from time to time, hence the baseball concession takes over.  But 
this is not what happens; for example, when Sportservice went to Kansas City with the 1950 Philadelphia Athletics contract it 
also served the football concession and Stevens took over the San Francisco 49'ers because of his baseball concession.  At 
Oakland only baseball participates in the concessions served the other three major league tenants and the parking also; and in 
Washington, D.C. the baseball team received part of the football concession revenue.  It is no answer to these commercial 
realities to say it is coincidence.  Why does not the football concessionaire take over sometimes? "

364,12," Corwin Edwards, noted economist, advises us: ""The growing use and misuse of the economic concept of the relevant market 
is a glaring example of infelicitous borrowing . . . Economists worth their salt also realize that on the supply side of the market 
there is a cross-elasticity of  [*245]  supply - that under appropriate incentives the seller may be capable of substituting 
alternative goods for his present goods and that the substitutability of goods in the productive process also helps to determine 
the boundaries of the market.  This capacity . . . varies with numerous characteristics of the productive process and of the cost 
structure as well as with financing and contractual arrangements associated therewith and consequently there are successive 
gradations in the capacity of the producer to offer alternatives. "
365,13," The Sportservice contracts in non-baseball facilities are also burdened with some ""cost of contract"", loans etc. and long terms 
ranging from ten to sixty years; contract extensions are also present that are similar to baseball."
365,14," Volume Service was able to secure the Oakland contract, subject to this litigation.  The award was from a public authority and 
is most unusual in the face of the litigation.  All other concessionaires that have broken into the major league baseball

Commission Act, § 5.  The Commission found that the merger transgressed both statutes.  Although a violation of § 5 is not 
necessarily a violation of § 7, see Federal Trade Commission v. Sperry Hutchinson, 405 U.S. 233, 246, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170, 92 S. 
Ct. 898 (1972), it is the case that every violation of § 7 is also a violation of § 5.  Since we hold that the Stanley-Amerock merger

410,8," Stanley's position is that the Commission's potential competition theory is inadequate to support a finding of merger illegality in 
this case.  The Commission held that Stanley was a reasonably probable entrant into the residential cabinet hardware market, 
and that Stanley would have entered by internal development had it not acquired Amerock.  In the Commission's view, the 
merger eliminated Stanley as a potential entrant, removed the ""disciplining effect"" it exercised on the market, and raised barriers 
to entry in an already concentrated market.  The Commission did not find that Stanley was the ""most likely entrant,"" see FTC v. 
Procter & Gamble, 386 U.S. 568, 581, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 87 S. Ct. 1224 (1967); cf. United States v. El Paso Natural Gas, 376 
U.S. 651, 658-59, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12, 84 S. Ct. 1044 (1964). In addition, the Commission did not point to any evidence indicating 
that Stanley exercised a ""disciplining effect"" on the market, nor did it illustrate how Stanley's acquisition of Amerock would 
contribute to raising barriers to entry in the residential cabinet hardware industry.  Inasmuch as we conclude that the Stanley-
Amerock merger is illegal because it eliminated substantial actual competition and thereby may lessen competition in the cabinet 
market as a whole, we need not decide the merits of the potential competition case. Thus, in this part of our opinion, we consider Stanley's argument that the actual competition theory was not ""adequately 
disclosed"".  In Part III, we shall treat the question whether that ground is ""adequately sustained"" by substantial evidence."
410,9," Thus, to note only a few examples, at page 23 of its brief Stanley argued that ""the so-called 'horizontal' aspects of the case, 
i.e., the amount of actual competition in cabinet hardware eliminated by the merger, is de minimis, and the Examiner erred in not 
so finding."" At pages 25-26 of its brief, Stanley argued that the examiner had incorrectly assessed ""the amount of actual 
competition in fact eliminated by the merger."" And finally Stanley asserted that ""in view of all the considerations summarized 
above, it is clear that the horizontal aspect of this case is quite different from the situations involved in the leading horizontal 
cases . . . ."" "

411,11," K. Kaysen & D. Turner, supra, at 133; Stigler, Mergers and Preventive Antitrust, 114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 176, 182 (1955). "
412,12," Our dissenting brother ignores this admonition, and would confine the power of antitrust enforcement agencies to cases 
where a ""trend"" toward concentration in the industry has been proven.  In doing so, he disregards the teaching of Continental 
Can that actual concentration is a far more insidious base upon which to build a merger. This would seem to pay greater heed to 
the symptom than the disease."
412,13," Stanley insists that such a market is not ""concentrated."" They cite Justice Department Merger Guidelines, see TRADE 
REGULATION REPORTS para. 4510, which indicate that a market is highly concentrated when shares of the four largest firms 
account for 75% or more of the market.  But as often proves true, reading on to the end of a sentence can be instructive.  It 
appears that the Department of Justice will ordinarily challenge mergers in a ""highly concentrated market"" where the acquired 
and acquiring firm account for 1% and 15% of the market respectively, TRADE REGULATION REPORTS para. 4510 at 6884.  
But the Department also characterizes some markets as ""less highly concentrated"" -- markets in which the four leading firms 
account for less than 75% of the market.  Under such conditions the Department will ordinarily challenge mergers when the 
parties account for 1% and 25% of the market.  Stanley controlled 1% of the cabinet hardware market; Amerock 22-24%.  It 
should be evident that market shares in this case are sufficiently close to the Department guidelines to cause us to hesitate 
before accepting Stanley's view."
412,14," Although the teachings of scholars cannot be dispositive, it would be foolhardy, in an area as complicated as this, to wholly 
disregard the lessons they have learned in a lifetime of study."
412,15," Kaysen & Turner, supra, at 72.  The authors define economic markets in terms of four levels of concentration. A ""dominant 
firm"" or ""partial monopoly"" market is one in which a single large firm supplies 60% of the market and no other seller supplies a 
significant portion of the demand.  ""Tight oligopoly"" is the next level of concentration. See also Bain, Industrial Organization 131 
(2d ed. 1968).  (Market in which four firms control 50% reflects high-moderate concentration.)"
412,16," Stanley's own partial reliance on Justice Department Merger guidelines, discussed at note 13, supra, reflects this same view.  
Stanley concedes that the Justice Department's view expressed in its guidelines should be given special weight; so too, we 
believe, should the Commission's views. "
413,17," United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, supra, 374 U.S. at 362. "
414,18," The relevant geographic markets in Pabst were Wisconsin, the Tri-State market consisting of Wisconsin, Michigan and 
Illinois, and the Nation.  The Court held that ""the evidence as to the probable effect of the merger on competition in Wisconsin, in 
the three-state area, and in the entire country was sufficient to show a violation of § 7 in each and all of these three areas."" 384 
U.S., at 552."
414,19," The Court found that Alcoa's acquisition of Rome Cable Corporation was reasonably likely to result in a substantial lessening 
of competition in the highly-concentrated aluminum conductor industry where 5 companies controlled 76% of the relevant 
market. Alcoa was the leading producer of aluminum conductor, with 27.8% of the market; Rome was ninth with 1.3%."
414,20," United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, supra, 377 U.S. 271, 281."
414,21," Stanley relies on Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961) to support its 
assertion that 1% is a de minimis share of the market.  Tampa was brought under § 3 of the Clayton Act, which forbids certain 
types of exclusive dealing contracts where the effect of such a contract may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 14. Tampa and Nashville had entered into a requirements contract "
415,," under which Nashville agreed to supply Tampa's coal requirements for a period of twenty years.  The District Court and the 
Court of Appeals held the contract invalid under § 3, and the Supreme Court reversed.  The Court said: "". . . the proportionate 
volume of the total relevant coal product as to which the challenged contract pre-empted competition, less than 1%, is, 
conservatively speaking, quite insubstantial.  A more accurate figure, even assuming pre-emption to the extent of the maximum 
anticipated total requirements . . . would be.77%."" 365 U.S., at 333. Justices Black and Douglas dissented. Our dissenting brother ignores the significance of the fact that Tampa Electric involved the validity of a contract under Clayton § 
3, not § 7.  The parameters of analysis in § 7 cases are not the same as in § 3 cases.  Courts are cautioned to exercise greater 
care before upholding a merger under § 7 inasmuch as ""integration HN9[
] by merger is more suspect than integration by 
contract, because of the greater permanence of the former."" United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, supra, 374 U.S. 321, 
366. Furthermore, the Court in Tampa thought it necessary to distinguish Standard Fashion Company v. Magrane-Houston 
Company, 258 U.S. 346, 66 L. Ed. 653, 42 S. Ct. 360 (1922), a prior § 3 case which had invalidated a two-year exclusive agency 
contract between Standard, a manufacturer and distributor of patterns, and Margane, a Boston retail dry goods store.  Standard 
Fashions, the Court said, involved a market with a dominant seller and there was no evidence of any concentration in the Tampa 
product market.  Because the instant case calls into question the validity of a merger under § 7, not the legality of a contract 
under § 3, and because of the concentrated structure of the cabinet hardware market, we find Stanley's reliance on Tampa 
Electric misplaced. Stanley has also cited to us, without discussion, several district court cases, which, it says, involved de minimis foreclosures.  
We have carefully considered these cases and find them inapposite."
415,22," In fact, some scholars are of the view that any horizontal acquisition involving a firm with more than 20% of the relevant 
market -- Amerock's share is 22-24% -- should be prima facie illegal.  See K. Kaysen & D. Turner, supra, at 133.  Stigler, 
Mergers and Preventive Antitrust, 104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 176, 182 (1955)."
415,23," The Commission found that it was reasonably probable that Stanley would have become increasingly more active in the 
residential cabinet hardware segment of the relevant market by way of internal expansion had expansion not been effected by 
merger. Stanley disputes this finding and says that top level Stanley management rejected the option of internal expansion in 
residential cabinet hardware. Instead, however, Stanley concedes that in January, 1965, approximately nine months prior to 
initial merger contacts between Stanley and Amerock, it was decided that Stanley would expand its production of architectural 
cabinet hardware. Donald Davis, then Executive Vice-President and now President of Stanley, in testimony before the Trial 
Examiner, stated: ""I was convinced that the best thing for the Hardware Division to do was to try to maximize their sales and 
profits in their existing product lines rather than spending their time and efforts looking for . . . new growth areas . . ."" And he 
asserted that Stanley had decided ""to concentrate [its] efforts in the area where [it] had some strength, namely, architectural 
cabinet hardware . . . ."" Whether we accept the Commission's or Stanley's view, once it is understood that the parties agreed that the cabinet hardware 
market as a whole is the relevant product market for this case, it is clear that Stanley had plans to become an even more 
significant competitor in the market.  Therefore, maintenance of its independence in the concentrated market, even as a 1% 
competitor, was of great importance in holding open the possibility of future deconcentration. "
416,24," In view of our decision in this case, we have no occasion to pass on the merits of the Commission's ""toe-hold theory"" which 
would have declared this merger illegal for the reason that even if Stanley were permitted to expand in the market via 
acquisition, it should have purchased one of the lesser firms in the industry, and not the market leader.  Stanley urges that the 
""toehold theory"" was not raised in the complaint, never litigated at the hearing, nor considered by the Examiner. It contends 
therefore, that any judgment based on the ""toehold theory"" would be violative of Fifth Amendment Due Process, and Section 5 of 
the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 554. We agree that the ""toehold theory"" was not litigated before the Examiner, and 
that the Commission was without authority to consider it.  Cf. Bendix Corp. v. FTC, 450 F.2d 534 (6th Cir. 1971). Because the 
""toehold theory,"" however, was an alternative basis of illegality, and since the actual competition case adequately established 
the finding of invalidity under the Clayton Act by substantial evidence, the Commission's error worked no prejudice to Stanley. Finally, Stanley contends that the Commission prejudged the facts of the case thereby denying petitioner its right to a fair 
hearing.  We have given this charge the serious attention it deserves but find it to be without merit."
416,1," The Hearing Examiner concluded: ""The acquisition and merger of Amerock, the leading independent domestic manufacturer and seller, by Stanley increased 
this high level of concentration and may result in a substantial lessening of competition in the said cabinet hardware market 
because of the elimination of Stanley as a reasonably probable, potentially capable and significant domestic manufacturer "
417,," and seller in the residential cabinet hardware segment of the said market, and particularly in the decorative residential 
cabinet hardware sales area of the said market."""
417,2," The Commission described the Hearing Examiner's Initial Decision as follows: ""Thus, the examiner found that respondent's acquisition of Amerock lessened competition because (1) absent the merger 
Stanley would probably have entered the cabinet hardware market on its own; (2) the elimination of Stanley as a potential 
competitor had the effect of increasing the barriers to entry; and (3) Stanley, as a potential competitor, had an influence on 
the performance of the cabinet hardware market. ""On the basis of these findings, the hearing examiner concluded that the effect of the merger may be to substantially lessen 
competition in the cabinet hardware market in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act."""

420,4," Stanley's $600,000 sales constituted 7 1/2% of all institutional cabinet hardware sales; Amerock's $200,000 equalled about 2 
1/2%."
420,5," The $84,000 overlap is based on the fact that Stanley's sales through Architectural OEM's was only $44,000 (compared with 
Amerock's sales of $160,000) and Amerock's sales of institutional hardware to Contract Hardware Distributors only $40,000 
(compared with Stanley's sales of $570,000)."

subsidiaries. "
423,9," See footnotes 8 and 23 (supra) of the majority opinion.  Footnote 8 rejects the Commission's contention that it proved that 
Stanley was the most likely potential entrant, that it served to discipline the market and that the merger raised barriers to entry.  
Footnote 23 similarly disparages the Commission's toe-hold theory. "
425,10," Compare footnote 8 of the majority opinion, which reaches substantially the same conclusion.  The Examiner made no finding 
that Stanley, as a potential competitor at the market's edge, had any competitive effect upon those in the market, and witnesses 
representing competitors in the cabinet hardware market testified that it did not have such an influence."
425,11," It may well be, as the majority opinion suggests, that FTC v. Procter & Gamble, 386 U.S. 568, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 87 S. Ct. 1224 
(1967), requires a finding that the acquiring firm was ""the most likely entrant."" Id. at 581. Since we conclude that under any 
standard there is no substantial evidence to indicate that Stanley exercised a disciplining effect, that issue is not reached.  
Similarly, we need not discuss the significance of other potential entrants on the market. "

466,31," See discussion of the effect of the 1971 and 1972 Arbitration Agreements, infra, at pages 507-509. "
467,32," While I do not here separately discuss the effect the ""temporary"" August 20, 1971 Arbitration Agreement had on the then 
existing, individual Standard Player Contracts, I hold that this 1971 Agreement similarly did not automatically modify existing "
468,," contracts unless there was explicit, individual player ratification of that Agreement.  See the discussion appearing below 
regarding the effect of the March 29, 1972 Arbitration Agreement."
468,33," It should be further noted that no NHL official has been able to refer to any written document which precisely states that an 
agreement (materially altering the terms of a contract) between the NHL and the NHLPA is automatically incorporated into an 
existing player contract."
468,34," Of course, I have found that the 1972 Arbitration Agreement (1) does not automatically modify a pre-existing, individual 
player's contract, and (2) is solely a device for determining salary."
468,35," By ""current contract,"" I am referring to those individual player's contracts which have not been renegotiated and signed 
expressly incorporating the terms of the March 29, 1972 Arbitration Agreement."
468,36," I make this holding solely because of the present monopolistic power of the NHL, coupled with its intent to exercise that power 
as further described at pp. 509-513, infra. As a practical matter, my holding that the 1972 Arbitration Agreement does not modify existing contracts, affects only those 
players whose contracts (1) were in effect on March 29, 1972, (when the Arbitration Agreement was executed); (2) were not 
specifically renewed or renegotiated by the individual player subsequent to March 29, 1972; and (3) according to the express 
terms of that existing contract, it would have expired on September 30, 1972, but for the existence and enforcement of the 
reserve clause.  By reason of the NHL Standard Player's Contract as promulgated in June 1972, the aforementioned three year 
arbitration agreement has been included and incorporated by reference and, thus, any player who signed such a contract 
(commencing October 1, 1972) automatically adopts, ratifies and accepts the terms of the March 29, 1972 Arbitration 
Agreement. As stated in Findings 83, 89, 97, and 211, supra, all of the players who have signed contracts with the WHA had 
NHL contracts which expired on September 30, 1972, and these NHL contracts were neither renegotiated nor renewed. I find it unnecessary in the context of a request for a preliminary injunction to decide either the validity or the enforceability of the 
1972 Arbitration Agreement as it specifically affects those players who have renegotiated and signed in 1972 new NHL contracts 
containing the new arbitration terms.  By my holding here, I do not mean to imply or intimate any view as to how that issue will 
ultimately be decided. "

476,54," See Findings of Fact 122, supra.  As to the four criteria of Winkleman v. New York Stock Exchange, 445 F.2d 786, 789 (3rd 
Cir. 1971) and page 513, supra, the prior sections establish that (1) there would be irreparable harm to the WHA if preliminary 
injunctive relief were not granted, (2) that there is a relative absence of such substantial harm to the NHL.  By my findings and 
conclusions of law that the NHL violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act it is clear that there is (3) ""a likelihood that the WHA 
would prevail on the merits"" in a final injunction hearing.  As for the final factor in this four-tier test, it is indisputable that there is 
no ""harm to the public interest"" by granting the preliminary injunction. The public will have the advantage of seeing more players 
in more contests, and the elitism of the season ticket holders will be ""checked"" and more tickets will be available to that public 
which claims hockey is the game of the second half of the twentieth century."

478,57," On procedural grounds Atlanta Hockey, Inc. and Nassau Sports, a Limited Partnership, owners of NHL teams in Georgia and 
New York were dismissed from CA 72-1661, see n. 14, supra.  Thus, as to C.A. 72-1661, this Order is not applicable to those 
two parties.  There is a question of fact as to whether Atlanta and Nassau are actually parties of record in Civil Action 72-1906 
(transferred on September 26, 1972 from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) and Civil Action No. 
72-1995 (transferred on October 11, 1972 from the United States District Court for the Central District of California).  However, 
they remain as named defendants in C.A. 72-1906 and counter-defendants in C.A. 72-1807.  I reserve my ruling on the issue as 
to whether this Order is applicable to Atlanta and Nassau because of their membership in NHL and their status in C.A. 72-1906, 
72-1995 and 72-1807."

includes milk, skim milk, buttermilk, flavored milk, flavored milk drinks, sweet cream and any mixture in fluid form of such 
products."" 12b of Plaintiff's Complaint."
481,2," The area of the relevant market is defined by the plaintiff as follows: ""Chicago Regional Marketing Area means the area defined

Daviess, Kane, Kendall, Lake, Lee, McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson, Will, Winnebago, and, in Whiteside County, the townships of: 
Caloma, Hanhaman, Hopkins, Hume, Jordan, Montmorency, Sterling, and Tampico."" 12k of Plaintiff's Complaint. "
482,3," Unlike many other State Antitrust actions, this action is brought not by the State as parens patriae, but rather by the State as 
the real party in interest. The defendants' arguments as to the authority of the State and its Attorney General to bring this action 
would be more cogent in a parens patriae type case.  See, e. g., New York v. Louisiana, and New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 
U.S. 76, 27 L. Ed. 656, 2 S. Ct. 176 (1883) (consolidated cases); Kansas v. United States, 204 U.S. 331, 51 L. Ed. 510, 27 S. Ct. 
388 (1907); Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, 220 U.S. 277, 55 L. Ed. 465, 31 S. Ct. 434 (1911); Louisiana 
v. Texas, 176 U.S. 1, 44 L. Ed. 347, 20 S. Ct. 251 (1899). It is well settled that HN3[
] the authority of a State and its Attorney 
General to bring an Antitrust action as the real party in interest should not be subject to the suspicious scrutiny which some 
overreaching parens patriae actions brought by States as governmental Robin Hoods might well deserve.  Malina & Blechman, 
Parens Patriae Suits for Treble Damages Under the Antitrust Act, 65 Nw. U.L. Rev. 193 (1970)."
482,4," See also: Rex v. Austen, 9 Price 12; Attorney General v. Brow, 1 Swanst. 294; Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr 2570; Wilkes v. Rex, 4

482,5," The authority of the Attorney General to file such a suit in Federal Court on behalf of the State of Illinois, qua proprietor or state 
institution, was never questioned in the Brunswick case. "
483,6," Defendants erroneously contend that an Antitrust action by the Attorney General for the State of Illinois seeking injunctive relief 
may only be filed in the Circuit Courts of Illinois.  See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, and Illinois v. Brunswick, supra."
483,7," The defendants have raised the issue that possible multiple litigation may be harmful to them.  The United States government, 
the governments of each state, and any individual threatened with injury by an antitrust violation may sue for injunctive relief to 
prevent violations of antitrust law.  Theoretically they may do so simultaneously against the same person for the same violation.  
However, in this case one injunction will be as effective as 100 or 100 injunctions will be no more effective than one.  This is in 
striking contrast to the potential harm which can be done by numerous suits for damages.  Hawaii v. Standard Oil, supra. "
488,1," Carnation was a private action for treble damages in which plaintiff alleged that a rate increase charged by defendant shipping 
corporations was a violation of the antitrust laws. Defendants shipping conference claimed they and their members were totally 
immune from the antitrust laws by virtue of the Shipping Act of 1916 which, they alleged, repealed all antitrust regulation of the 
rate-making activities of the shipping industry.  They relied on the Court's prior decisions in U.S. Navigation Co. v. Cunard 
Steamship Co., 284 U.S. 474, 76 L. Ed. 408, 52 S. Ct. 247 (1931) and Far East Conference v. U.S., 342 U.S. 570, 96 L. Ed. 
576, 72 S. Ct. 492 (1951). However, the Supreme Court interpreted these decisions as permitting an antitrust suit for damages if 
the activities being attacked are not ""arguably lawful"" under the regulatory statute.  Inasmuch as the activities were ""arguably 
lawful"" in Carnation, the Court determined that the judicial proceedings should be stayed, pending a determination by the 
Commission of the legality of the defendants' activities. In Allied this court had before it a case ""in all respects analogous to the Carnation case except that the alleged agreement 
concededly has not been passed upon by the CAB."" 393 F.2d at 448. The district court had granted a stay, but our court 
reversed the district court, vacated the stay order, and instructed the district court to carry forward the proceedings on the 
antitrust claims."
488,2," It is clear HN4[
] under Section 412 of the Act (49 U.S.C. § 1382) that the Board can only approve and thereby immunize 
agreements to which ""air carriers"" are parties.  Additionally, HN5[
] under Section 411 (49 U.S.C. § 1381), the Board can issue 
cease and desist orders against air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents which are engaged in unfair methods of 
competition."
488,3," HN6[
] Subsections (3) and (10) of Section 101 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. § 1301) reads as follows: (3) ""Air carrier"" means any citizen of the United States who undertakes, whether directly or indirectly or by a lease or any 
other arrangement, to engage in air transportation: Provided, That the Board may by order relieve air carriers who are not 
directly engaged in the operation of the aircraft in air transportation from the provisions of this chapter to the extent and for 
such periods as may be in the public interest."
488,*," * * (10) ""Air transportation"" means interstate, overseas, or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. "
489,4," Paragraph 7 of the Agreement defining the responsibilities of Air Cargo, Inc. reads as follows:"
489,7," .  Each of the parties hereby confers upon Air Cargo, Inc. full power and authority, on its behalf, subject only to a limitation 
upon payment that may be due for services in the several amounts set forth hereinafter in this paragraph 7, to negotiate 
and execute agreements or arrangements (if and only if any such agreement or arrangement confers the right on the 
parties thereto and Air Cargo, Inc. to cancel the agreement or arrangement on not more than sixty days' notice), and to 
renew, modify, cancel, or terminate in accordance with the terms hereof, any existing arrangement, by or between any of 
the parties hereto and any other party or parties engaged in performing under contract pick-up and delivery or other 
services with respect to the handling of air freight, air cargo, or air express (including without limitation, the Air Express 
Agreement between the respective parties and the Railway Express Agency, Inc.), provided, however, that insofar as the 
foregoing delegates authority to cancel or terminate any existing arrangements which have heretofore been filed with and 
approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board, the exercise thereof shall be subject to either (a) approval of the cancellation or 
termination of such an existing arrangement by the Civil Aeronautics Board or (b) the approval of this agreement by the 
Civil Aeronautics Board.  It is agreed and understood in this connection that it is the purpose and intent of this agreement 
that Air Cargo Inc. should have responsibility for: (a) Determining the date upon which each party hereto shall combine and operate as a single air cargo service its air 
express and airfreight services (which date shall be the same for all parties hereto), and shall make available to all shippers 
of air cargo, on an optional basis, such special services as may be practicable to meet shippers' requirements; and each of 
the parties will, on and after such date, take such action as may be appropriate to effect such objective; (b) Providing, directly or by contract, pick-up and delivery services at all points within the continental United States served 
by any party hereto, and tripper services between such points and the airports through which they are served; (c) Providing, directly or by contract, terminal facilities and services incidental to the proper handling of air freight and air 
cargo at all such points; and (d) Providing, directly or by contract, clerical, accounting, and other services which may be desired by the parties hereto in 
the interest of promoting maximum efficiency, eliminating unnecessary duplication of expense, and coordination of their 
respective air freight and air cargo services with one another and with those rendered by other common carriers of 
property. "
490,5," Although both Carnation and Allied dealt with activities which had been discontinued, the clear implication of the opinions is 
that the court has jurisdiction if the activities are unlawful under the regulatory statute and the relief sought is an award of 
damages.  The rationale is that an award of damages could not interfere with a later agency decision prospectively to approve 
the continuance of the challenged activity, whereas injunctive relief could cause a conflict between the agency and the court.  
Thus, the Court in Carnation laid down the broad principle that courts are only precluded ""from awarding damages when the 
defendants' conduct is arguably lawful . . ."" 383 U.S. at 222. No distinction is drawn between continuing conduct and past 
conduct.  Likewise, in Allied, we noted that a damage award could not interfere with cease and desist power or with 
immunization power inasmuch as the damage award would not have ""prospective applicability."" 393 F.2d at 448."
490,6," This paragraph reads as follows: . . . It having been represented to the Board that Air Cargo, Inc. will not have responsibility for, nor control over, the rates, 
charges, rules, regulations, or practices applicable to air transportation; that it will not issue or sign any shipping contract or 
document except in the name of and as agent for a member air carrier party to the agreement; that it will not assume any 
responsibility to the consignor or consignee of any property transported by air; and it will not hold itself out to the public to 
perform any service or accept any responsibility except as agent for a member air carrier party to the agreement; . . ."
490,7," This clause reads as follows: The Board further finding that the future development of Air Cargo, Inc. is uncertain and that its activities may require future 
reconsideration of the approval granted herein. . . . "
504,1, Tidewater then transferred title to its Western Marketing and Manufacturing Division to Phillips. 
505,2," Tidewater merged with Getty Oil Co. on September 30, 1967.  It has never been contended that that merger altered 
Tidewater's legal status in this case."
505,3," In its motion to be dismissed, Tidewater contended ""that Section 7 of the Clayton Act is directed only against the acquiring 
corporation and not against the seller, that the sale of assets by defendant Tidewater Oil Company to Phillips Petroleum 
Company has long ago been consummated, that no relief is obtainable against Tidewater Oil Company, and that its presence in 
the suit is no longer necessary or appropriate."""
505,4," Subsequent to the decision by the Ninth Circuit in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that § 1292 (b) 
could be used to take an interlocutory appeal in a Government civil antitrust case. See Fisons Ltd. v. United States, 458 F.2d 
1241, 1244-1248, cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1041 (1972). The only other court of appeals to consider the question, the Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reached the same result as the Ninth Circuit in this case.  See Farbenfabriken Bayer, 
A. G. v. United States, 1968 CCH Trade Cas. para. 72,570, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 959 (1968); Glaxo Group, Ltd. v. United

case that the Attorney General certifies to be of ""general public importance."" See also 49 U. S. C. § 44. This three-judge court 
provision is also a reflection of the ""great importance"" attached to Government civil antitrust cases and was intended to provide a 
mechanism for full consideration of such cases by a panel of judges ""before presentation to the Supreme Court as if heard by 
the United States circuit court of appeals."" H. R. Rep. No. 3020, 57th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1903).  But this provision has been

court under the Anti-Trust Act an appeal lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and six months were allowed for taking the appeal.

that the courts of appeals, subject to review on certiorari in this Court, are incapable of providing the uniformity of interpretation "
507,," necessary to the administration of the antitrust laws.  See infra, at 170.  In 1903, the courts of appeals had been in existence for 
only 12 years and various reservations about them had not yet been dispelled.  See F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, The Business of 
the Supreme Court 258 (1927).  Since that time, we have had over a half-century of experience with the courts of appeals --

507,20," The 1906 amendment removed the limitation on interlocutory appeal to causes ""in which an appeal from a final decree may be

cause."" Act of Apr. 14, 1906, c. 1627, 34 Stat. 116.  In codifying the Evarts Act interlocutory appeals provision in 1911, ""in any 
cause"" was struck, and the provision was amended to allow the courts of appeals to entertain appeals from interlocutory orders 
""notwithstanding an appeal in such case might, upon final decree under the statutes regulating the same, be taken directly to the 
Supreme Court."" Act of Mar. 3, 1911, § 129, 36 Stat. 1134.  Finally, the famous Judges' Bill of 1925, in turn struck the 
""notwithstanding"" language, with the result that the codified provision, § 129, simply allowed an appeal to be ""taken from [an] 
interlocutory order or decree [granting or denying an injunction or appointing a receiver] to the circuit court of appeals . . . ."" Act 
of Feb. 13, 1925, amending § 129, 43 Stat. 937. The 1928 amendment is completely without relevance here since it merely extended the applicability of the statute to

Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1924)."
507,23," Thus, the 1906 amendment, see n. 20, supra, was intended to render ineffective certain evasive pleading tactics that had 
theretofore been employed to take advantage of the fact that under the Evarts Act an interlocutory appeal could be taken where 
only a nonconstitutional issue was at stake but not where a constitutional issue was involved.  See H. R. Rep. No. 542, 59th 
Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1906); 40 Cong. Rec. 1723 (remarks of Rep. Brantley); id., at 4856 (remarks of Sen. Bacon). "
508,," The legislative history concerning the 1911 amendment, see n. 20, supra, indicates that the ""notwithstanding"" language was 
designed to ""remove any doubt"" that the limitation -- initially struck by the 1906 amendment -- on interlocutory appeals to those 
cases in which an appeal might be taken to the court of appeals after a final decree had been eliminated.  But this merely 
suggests an intent finally to resolve with even more specific language the problem of evasive pleading which had motivated the 
1906 amendment.  See S. Rep. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, p. 53 (1910).  Thus, in response to inquiry whether this 
amendment constituted ""a change in the existing law,"" Senator Heyburn, a sponsor of the legislation, said on the Senate floor, 
""This is the existing law."" 45 Cong. Rec. 4001. As to the 1925 version of the interlocutory appeals provision, see n. 20, supra, the analysis prepared by the committee of this 
Court which drafted it explained that the ""notwithstanding"" language was ""eliminated as having no further application in view of 
the repeal of"" the provisions that had necessitated the initial 1906 amendment.  Hearing on S. 2060 and S. 2061 before a 
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1924).  And if the addition of the 
""notwithstanding"" language in 1911 did not establish court of appeals jurisdiction over interlocutory orders in Expediting Act 
cases, we fail to see how dropping that language in 1925 did so.  At the same time, elsewhere in the Judges' Bill, § 2 of the 
Expediting Act was carried forward without alteration.  See Act of Feb. 13, 1925, amending § 238 (1), 43 Stat. 938.  In doing so, 
it was stated: ""A direct review by the Supreme Court of an interlocutory or final judgment or decree of a district court may be had 
where it is so provided in the following Acts or parts of Acts, and not otherwise: (1) Section 2 of the Act of February 11, 1903, 'to 
expedite the hearing and determination' of certain suits brought by the United States under the antitrust . . . laws . . . ."" Ibid.  
(emphasis added).  Section 2, of course, has never contained a provision allowing appeal of interlocutory orders.  Moreover, Mr. 
Justice Van Devanter, a member of this Court's committee that prepared the bill, testified before the Senate Committee that the 
character of Expediting Act cases ""suggest[s] that they should go directly to the Supreme Court rather than through the circuit 
courts of appeals"" without any indication that an exception was being introduced for interlocutory appeals to the courts of 
appeals.  Hearing on S. 2060 and S. 2061 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st 
Sess., 33 (1924).  See also S. Rep. No. 362, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924)."
508,24," Certainly the Court spoke fully cognizant of at least the amendment contained in the Judges' Bill of just four years before, see 
n. 20, supra, since all seven sitting Justices had been on the Court when its committee submitted the bill to Congress. "
509,25," In Alkali Export Assn., the Court went on to say: ""[Extraordinary] writs may not be used as a substitute for an authorized appeal; and where, as here, the statutory scheme [the 
Expediting Act] permits appellate review of interlocutory orders only on appeal from the final judgment, review by certiorari or 
other extraordinary writ is not permissible in the face of the plain indication of the legislative purpose to avoid piecemeal 
reviews."" 325 U.S., at 203 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court found that exigent circumstances associated with the District Court's denial of the defendant's motion to 
dismiss the action justified immediate review by common-law certiorari in the particular case.  Id., at 203-204. The Court in De Beers, stating that ""what is . . . said [in Alkali Export Assn.] applies in this instance,"" 325 U.S., at 217, granted 
review under the All Writs Act of a preliminary injunction, although normally review would have been to the court of appeals 
under what is now 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (a)(1). Of course, nothing we say today signifies a retreat from our previous statements 
that appeals of interlocutory orders in Government civil antitrust cases cannot be taken even to this Court."

509,27," In 1951 reference to the District Court of Guam was inserted in the section, Act of Oct. 31, 1951, § 49, 65 Stat. 726, and

into the Union in 1959, Act of July 7, 1958, § 12 (e), 72 Stat. 348.  Finally, when subsection (b) was added to the section, the

512,41," Petitioner suggests two avenues of escape from this anomalous situation: (1) that under § 1292 (a)(1) an interlocutory appeal 
may in fact lie from an injunctive order in a Government civil antitrust case; (2) that if an appeal from such an order cannot be 
taken under § 1292 (a), it may nevertheless be taken under § 1292 (b) since, the argument goes, the latter applies to all orders 
not appealable under the former, ""whatever the nature of the order and whatever the reason for its non-appealability."" Reply 
Brief for Petitioner 7-8.  Our discussion in Part I of this opinion is sufficient to dispose of petitioner's first contention.  As to the 
second argument, while the language of § 1292 (b) is unqualified on its face, the legislative history indicates that Congress was 
concerned only with orders of types other than those specified in § 1292 (a); in other words, § 1292 (b) was intended to 
supplement § 1292 (a), not to provide a substitute for it.  See n. 35, supra.  Moreover, it would be, to say the least, extraordinary 
for Congress to have resorted to such a subtle method of establishing for the first time in Government civil antitrust cases 
interlocutory appeals for orders of the type specified in § 1292 (a) without giving any hint whatsoever that this was its purpose."
512,42, Brief for United States 18.
512,43," Nor can it be ignored that subsequent to both the 1948 revision which resulted in § 1292 (a) and the enactment of § 1292 (b), 
we have reaffirmed that a final judgment is an essential prerequisite to an appeal of an order issued in a government civil 
antitrust case since ""Congress . . . limited the right of review in such cases to an appeal from a decree which disposed of all 
matters, and it precluded the possibility of an appeal either to this Court or to a Court of Appeals from an interlocutory decree."" 
Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S., at 305 n. 9. Section 1292 was not, to be sure, specifically at issue in Brown Shoe.  
But in holding, as it did, that the District Court's decree was appealable only because it was ""final,"" id., at 306-309, the Court 
necessarily foreclosed the possibility of an interlocutory appeal to any court, and thus its remark concerning the preclusion of 
interlocutory appeals cannot be lightly dismissed. "
513,44, The sole exception to this would be if the certified question had previously been considered by way of certiorari.
513,45," Only if we were to dispose of a controlling question in such a way as to end all proceedings would the possibility of a 
subsequent appeal be foreclosed.  A threshold issue of jurisdiction might present such a controlling question; but even that type 
of issue will often not end an entire Government civil antitrust case which might involve a number of parties -- as is true in this 
case where the certified question relates to only one of the two defendants."
513,46," See also Fisons Ltd. v. United States, 458 F.2d 1241 (CA7), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1041 (1972) (service of process); 
Farbenfabriken Bayer, A. G. v. United States, 1968 CCH Trade Cas. para. 72,570 (CADC), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 959 (1968) 
(quasi in rem jurisdiction). "
514,47," Other than threshold procedural issues, the question consistently sought to be raised on interlocutory appeal has been the 
propriety of orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions with respect to proposed acquisitions. See United States v. Cities 
Service Co., 410 F.2d 662 (CA1 1969); United States v. FMC Corp., 321 F.2d 534 (CA9 1963); United States v. Ingersoll-Rand 
Co., 320 F.2d 509 (CA3 1963). Although appeals of such orders would involve the merits of the antitrust actions, the fact is that 
permitting interlocutory appeal under § 1292 (b) would not bring these orders and the related evidence before the courts of 
appeals since they come within § 1292 (a)(1).  Cf. n. 41, supra.  Moreover, because of the need for speed if an acquisition is to 
be enjoined before accomplished, requests for such interlocutory orders must be determined after, at most, only an initial 
hearing and without full development of the record.  Consequently, appeals from such orders would not necessarily bring before 
the courts of appeals the lengthy records and numerous documents with which we have often been forced to deal after final 
judgment."
514,48," See S. Rep. No. 2434, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1958)."
514,49," Of course, this problem would not exist if the interlocutory decision were reviewed immediately on certiorari in this Court; but, 
as we have already seen, this alternative entails serious problems of its own."
514,50," In this respect, it must be recalled that interlocutory appeal under § 1292 (b) is subject to the decision of the court of appeals in 
the exercise of its discretion, to allow appeal of the question certified by the district court.  Thus, the effectiveness of § 1292 (b) 
in Government civil antitrust cases would be dependent upon the willingness of the courts of appeals to assume this new burden 
aware of the limited import of their decisions and of the fact that interlocutory appeals in such cases would represent only added 
work for them, since they would not otherwise consider any appeal. "
515,1," It is true that several Justices over the years have expressed the desire that the antitrust cases come to us only by certiorari to 
the courts of appeals.  So far as I am aware the only opinion speaking for the Court containing that suggestion is United States 
v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174. But there the idea was contained only in a footnote ( id., at 175 n. 1); and as Mr. Chief Justice 
Hughes was wont to say, ""Footnotes do not really count."""

517,2," The Senate Report on the bill that became § 1292 (b) stated: ""This legislation results from a considerable study by committees of the Judicial Conference.  The legislation itself was 
introduced at the request of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts pursuant to the direction of the Judicial 
Conference of the United States. . . .  The bill results from a growing awareness of the need for expedition of cases pending 
before the district courts.  Many cases which are filed in the Federal district courts require the district judge to entertain motions 
at an early stage in the proceedings which, if determined, against the plaintiff, result in a final order which would then be 
appealable to the circuit courts of appeals of the United States.  However, such motions, if determined in the plaintiff's favor, are 
interlocutory since they do not end the litigation and are not therefore, under existing provisions of law, appealable. . . . . . . . ""The committee believes that this legislation constitutes a desirable addition to the existing authority to appeal from interlocutory 
orders of the district courts of the United States. . . .  Any legislation, therefore, appropriately safeguarded, which might aid in the 
disposition of cases before the district courts of the United States by saving useless expenditure of court time is such as to 
require the approbation of all those directly concerned with the administration of justice in the United States."" S. Rep. No. 2434, 
85th Cong., 2d Sess., 2, 4 (1958)."
517,3," The Senate Report stated: ""There are many civil actions from which similar illustrations could be furnished.  For example, in an antitrust action a plea may 
be entered that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. If this motion is denied, under existing law the matter is not 
appealable and the case then goes forward to trial.  Disposition of antitrust cases may take considerable time, yet upon appeal 
following final disposition of such cases, the court of appeals may well determine that the statute of limitations had run and for 
that reason the district court did not have jurisdiction."" Id., at 3. "
518,4," Although the antitrust cases referred to in the Senate Committee Report on § 1292 (b) were apparently private cases, rather 
than Government litigation, the proposed legislation was introduced, after considerable study, at the direction of the Judicial 
Conference of the United States (n. 2, supra), whose members -- all eminent federal judges -- were surely familiar with the 
appellate procedure in civil antitrust cases brought by the Government."
518,5," The House Report on the bill explains this provision by quoting a letter of the Attorney General as follows: ""There are a number of cases now provided by statute where appeals may be made directly to the Supreme Court from the 
district and circuit courts . . . . ""The class of cases that I suggest should be brought within this rule, it seems to me, is of as great importance as any of those 
referred to.  The suggested provision requiring a full bench of the circuit judges would insure the cases receiving as full 
consideration before presentation to the Supreme Court as if heard by the United States circuit court of appeals."" H. R. Rep. No.

519,7," United States v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 320 F.2d 509 (CA3 1963). The reasoning of the Third Circuit in this case was as follows: 
Section 1292 (a)(1) permits an appeal to a court of appeals of interlocutory injunctive orders ""except where a direct review may 
be had in the Supreme Court."" Since the Supreme Court has direct review in Expediting Act cases only from final judgments, it 
has none from interlocutory orders.  Hence, the exception in § 1292 (a)(1) does not bar court of appeals jurisdiction over 
interlocutory injunctive orders in Government antitrust cases.  The court then concluded: ""In fact, it is extremely difficult and requires doing violence to the language of the statute to escape the conclusion that 
interlocutory orders, such as the one at bar, are reviewable by a court of appeals excepting and only excepting those types of 
cases in which an interlocutory order is directly reviewable by the Supreme Court."" 320 F.2d, at 517. "

preclude any recovery, by rendering the measure of damages uncertain.  Failure to apply it would mean that the more grievous 
the wrong done, the less likelihood there would be of a recovery.  The most elementary conceptions of justice in public policy 
require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created.  That principal is an ancient 
one and it is not restricted to proof of damage in antitrust suits, although their character is such as frequently to call for its

Court held that Congress may control rates charged by carriers for transportation entirely within a state if such regulation is 
necessary to prevent discrimination against interstate traffic.  As the Court said, ""This is not to say that Congress possesses the 
authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State, as such, but that it does possess the power to foster and protect interstate 
commerce, and to take all measures necessary and appropriate to that end, although intrastate transactions of interstate carriers 
may thereby be controlled."" Id. at 353. Accord: Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 232,

617,13," See Stern, The Scope of the Phrase Interstate Commerce, 41 A.B.A.J. 823, 871 (1955), in Selected Essays on Constitutional 
Law: 1938-1962, at 298 (Comm. of Ass'n of Am. L. Schools, eds., West Pub. Co., 1963). In Wickard v. Filburn, quoted in the text, the Court upheld the power of Congress to limit the amount of wheat farmers may grow 
in their own fields for their own use because the interstate market may be affected by the reduction in market demand resulting 
from the self-satisfaction of the needs of such farmers for wheat. In United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 86 L. Ed. 726, 62 S. Ct. 523 (1942), a case of particular significance 
here, the Court held that because Congress may regulate the price of milk moving in interstate commerce it may also regulate 
the price of milk produced, purchased, processed, and sold entirely within a state when the intrastate milk competes with milk 
shipped in interstate commerce. See id. at 121. ""The national power to regulate the price of milk moving interstate into Chicago, Illinois, marketing area, extends to such 
control over intrastate transactions there as is necessary and appropriate to make the regulation of the interstate commerce 
effective; and . . . it includes authority to make like regulations for the marketing of intrastate milk whose sale and 
competition with the interstate milk affects its price structure so as in turn to affect adversely the Congressional regulation.""  See also Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 321, 19 L. Ed. 2d 554, 88 S. Ct. 443 (1967). The principle applied in these and similar decisions is applicable to cases under the Sherman Act. As the Court said in 
Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 232, 92 L. Ed. 1328, 68 S. Ct. 996 n. 11 (1948), "
618,," ""Once applied to transportation and the Interstate Commerce Acts, it was inevitable that the approach would be extended to the 
productive and industrial phases of the national economy and the statutes regulating them, including the Sherman Act."" The reverse is also true.  Sherman Act decisions are commonly cited in sustaining other federal economic regulations of local 
commerce. For example, Wrightwood Dairy, an Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act case, rests upon cases holding that 
""competitive practices which are wholly intrastate may be reached by the Sherman Act because of their injurious effect on 
interstate commerce."" 315 U.S. at 120."
618,14," See P. Benson, Supreme Court and the Commerce Clause 101 (Dunellen 1970). As the Court said in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 41-42, 81 L. Ed. 893, 57 S. Ct. 615 (1937): ""We have 
often said that interstate commerce itself is a practical conception.  It is equally true that interferences with that commerce must 
be appraised by a judgment that does not ignore actual experience."" And in North American Co. v. SEC, 327 U.S. 686, 705, 90 L. Ed. 945, 66 S. Ct. 785 (1946), ""Commerce itself is an intensely 
practical matter. . . .  To deal with it effectively, Congress must be able to act in terms of economic and financial realities.  The 
commerce clause gives it authority so to act."" In deciding whether the requisite ""substantial economic effect"" is present, it is appropriate to consider whether the problem 
affects commerce in more than one state, so as to be beyond the practical power of a single state to regulate.  See Apex 
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 495, 84 L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1940); Stern, supra note 13, at 304; Stern, The 
Commerce Clause and the National Economy: 1933-1946 (Pt. 2), 59 Harv. L. Rev. 883, 944-45 (1946). "
619,15," See also Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S. Ct. 1357, 28 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1971). As we said in United States v. 
Rodriquez-Comacho, 468 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir. 1972), quoting Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495, 521, 42 S. Ct. 397, 66 L. Ed. 735 
(1922): ""This court will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress in such a matter unless the relation of the subject to 
interstate commerce and its effect upon it are clearly nonexistent."""
619,16, We do not decide the extent to which this question is for the judge or for the jury.
619,17," As stated in the stipulation, ""Plaintiff sells 'Go' exclusively within the State of Arizona, 'Go' being a filled milk banned from 
interstate commerce under 21 U.S.C. §§ 61, 62."" See note 2. "
620,18," See Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 302, 13 L. Ed. 2d 290, 85 S. Ct. 377 (1964): ""The cases holding that interstate commerce ends when goods come to rest in the State of destination [are not] apposite here 
That line of cases has been applied with reference to state taxation or regulation but not in the field of federal regulation."""
620,19," Although the effect in Page, was at one point characterized as ""nonexistent,"" 290 F.2d at 333, it was simultaneously 
characterized as ""indirect,"" id. It is clear, therefore, that ""nonexistent"" was not used in its literal sense. "
621,20," Too often in this area, judicial discomfort with uncertainty, aggravated by the rapid expansion of traditional conceptions of 
federal commerce power, has led to a continued grasping for specific, easily applicable standards, standards which regularly 
had to be ""reinterpreted"" or discarded altogether in the face of changing economic realities.  In the final analysis, the real-world 
business nature of the Sherman Act's purpose and subject matter permits no easy solutions.  As noted earlier, it is the duty of 
the courts to apply ""a practical, case-by-case economic judgment"" rather than to take refuge in ""abstract or mechanistic 
formulae."" See text at note 14 supra. "
622,21," Uniform Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 400 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1968), is also distinguishable.  We note that defendants have 
not relied upon it.  The restraint involved was ""price fixing in the retail gas market in Helena, Montana."" The impact upon 
interstate commerce relied upon was that plaintiff purchased an unspecified portion of its gasoline from a Montana refinery 
which, in turn, obtained its crude oil from Wyoming, and that an unspecified portion of plaintiff's sales involved credit cards of 
other companies and collection for such sales was obtained through an oil company located in Spokane, Washington. 400 F.2d 
at 269. Thus, the interstate commerce involved may have been de minimis.  As the court held, ""Assuming that there was 
involvement with interstate commerce in the [plaintiff's] operation, there was nothing upon which the jury might have based an 
assessment of the substantiality of that involvement."" Id. at 270. In the present case, on the other hand, all of the economical 
significant ingredients of ""Go"" move in interstate commerce. In addition, of course, plaintiff in this case has alleged a restraint upon interstate commerce in fluid milk, including that distributed 
by defendants.  See Part V."

effect on date of sale, less dealer truck bulk allowance in effect on date of sale. Sacked Chows will be sold to other dealers at 
Manufacturer's mill wholesale dealer prices plus freight to warehouse location in effect on the date of sale plus Two Dollars 
($2.00) per ton warehouse charge."
627,4," .  Submit to Manufacturer's plant in Macon, Georgia daily memorandum billings and weight tickets, evidencing sales of bagged 
and/or bulk Chows by Warehouseman to approved Purina dealers from the warehouse."
627,5," .  Prepare and file all necessary license and tax returns and pay all license fees and taxes assessed or levied in respect of the 
Warehouseman's activities, or of the Chows and Warehouseman's possession under this Agreement."
627,6," .  Sell and deal, during the term of this Agreement, and any renewals thereof, in Purina Chows as the only commercial mixed 
and manufactured feeds sold or offered for sale to Warehouseman's customers; (provided, Warehouseman may sell and deal, 
on a retail basis only, in Check-R-Mix feeds, which are a mixture of Purina manufactured feed concentrates and locally produced 
grain). C.  This Agreement shall be for a term of one (1) year from the date hereof, and shall continue automatically thereafter from 
month to month until cancelled by either party upon thirty (30) days' written notice of its election so to cancel. Manufacturer shall 
have the additional right to terminate this Agreement, at any time, before the end of the initial term or any monthly renewal, upon 
the occurrence of either of the following: (1) Should Warehouseman be discontinued for any reason as a Purina dealership; or (2) Should Warehouseman fail to perform all covenants and conditions of this or any other agreement between Warehouseman 
and Manufacturer. D.  This agreement shall not be assigned by either party hereto. "

649,5," This Court does not reach the question of the validity of a treaty that would purport to exempt foreign business from the reach 
of the antitrust laws of the United States.  These treaties just do not approach the problem posed in this case. "
662,1," Specifically at issue in the present litigation is U.S. Patent No.   2,900,304, issued August 18, 1959.  The patent embodies two 
types of claims -- (1) a method of curing humans or animals of external fungus diseases by administering ""an effective amount of 
griseofulvin"" to them internally and (2) a capsule, tablet, or pill containing an effective amount of griseofulvin."
662,2," Specifically at issue in the present litigation is U.S. Patent No.   3,330,727, issued July 11, 1967.  This patent covers the 
improved (finely ground or ""microsize"") dosage form of griseofulvin. This form has proved more effective and more marketable 
than other dosage forms of the drug. "
663,3," Although AMHO, Schering, and J & J could have manufactured bulk-form griseofulvin under Glaxo's patents, in practice they 
purchased the bulk form of the drug from ICI and Glaxo and themselves performed the processes to convert the drug to dosage 
form."
663,4," See, supra, n. 1.  The Government contended that the ""method"" portion of the patent did not disclose how to practice the 
invention in that it failed to specify what is an ""effective amount"" of the drug.  See 35 U. S. C. § 112. The Government also 
argued that ICI's product claims were invalid because the dosage form that they covered did not specify an ""effective amount"" of 
the drug, did not specify the diseases that could be cured, and claimed a patent monopoly over a substance long in the public 
domain.  See 35 U. S. C. §§ 100 and 101."
663,5," The case was decided on the basis of various motions concerning the merits and the relief.  Testimony was not received; the 
facts were developed in affidavits, exhibits, and interrogatories accompanying the motions."
663,6," See n. 2.  The Government had sought to challenge the patent on the basis that the patent purported to monopolize a product 
long in the public domain, on the basis of prior disclosure, and on the basis of prior public use.  See 35 U. S. C. §§ 100, 101, 102 
(a), 102 (b). "
665,7," The Government argued in the District Court: ""We submit that [ United States v.] Gypsum [333 U.S. 364 (1948)] should be understood more broadly to support challenge to 
any patent used by antitrust defendants in furtherance of their illegal program.  The importance of the Imperial patent to the 
defendants' scheme to violate the antitrust laws is plain.  It was, according to ICI's contentions, the reason for the patent pool 
agreement in the first place; Glaxo's grant of rights to ICI was paid for with the Imperial patent. Without the Imperial patent the 
defendants could not maintain their monopoly in the United States over the drug, for then anyone who could secure bulk form 
griseofulvin could make it up into pills and sell them without a patent to stop him; bulk form griseofulvin is, as ICI points out, 
unpatented.  The Imperial patent thus bolsters the effectiveness of the illegal restraint on alienation ICI imposes on the resale of 
bulk form griseofulvin: if a small drug company somehow manages to get the unpatented bulk form drug despite ICI's restraint 
on alienation designed to prevent it or anyone else from doing so, the defendants may still suppress the manufacture of the drug 
by threat of patent infringement suit.  In this context, vindication of the public interest in competition in unpatentable goods is 
doubly important -- for there is a double impediment to commerce -- the patent and the conspiracy."" The Government, throughout its brief in this Court, emphasizes the importance of the patents to the antitrust violation. ""In cases like this, the patents involved generally are of major importance in furthering the allegedly unlawful patent licensing 
practices; they give the defendants the power which enables them to impose the restraints of trade.  That is the situation here.  
The patents were essential to the appellees' scheme to violate the antitrust laws."" "
667,1," 1 Stat. 109.  For an excellent review of the history briefly summarized here, see Cullen & Vickers, Fraud in the Procurement of 
a Patent,  29 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 110 (1960)."
667,2, 1 Stat. 318.
667,3, 5 Stat. 117. 
669,4," The majority inaccurately states that the lower court sustained the allegations in the complaint that appellees had unreasonably 
restrained trade by prohibiting the licensee from selling or reselling bulk-form griseofulvin. In fact, the District Court only found 
that the restraint on reselling bulk-form griseofulvin constituted the per se antitrust violations found. "
670,5," This total lack of proof of any relationship also defeats for me the granting of compulsory licensing of the United States patents. 
Compulsory licensing is a recognized remedy in patent misuse cases, see, e. g., International Salt Co. v.  United States, 332 
U.S. 392 (1947), Hartford-Empire Co. v.  United States, 323 U.S. 386 (1945), but here the District Court specifically found there 
was no patent misuse or other abuse of patent rights. "

of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" 15 U. S. C. § 18. For the legislative history of the amendment in 1950 that greatly expanded the section's scope, 64 Stat. 1125, see Brown Shoe

698,4," Nationally, the number of brewers decreased from 663 in 1935 to 140 in 1965."
698,5," Of the three ""top ten"" brewers that were not selling in New England, Falstaff ranked fourth nationally, the other two ranking 
eighth and ninth.  From Boston, Massachusetts, the distance to Falstaff's closest brewery was 844 miles, while the distance to 
the eighth and ninth largest sellers' breweries was 1,385 and 2,000 miles respectively."
698,6," A ""regional,"" as contrasted with a ""national"" brewer, is one that is not selling in all the significant national markets. "
699,7," In 1958, Falstaff commissioned a study of actions it should take to maximize profits.  The study recommended, inter alia, that 
Falstaff become a national brewer by entering those areas where it was not then marketing its product, especially the Northeast, 
and that Falstaff should build a brewery on the East Coast rather than buy."
699,8," For example, Falstaff in several press releases and in the company publication expressed its desire for national distribution, 
and at a panel discussion in October 1964 the president of Falstaff, in response to a question as to Falstaff's reaction to industry 
trends in beer sales, stated: ""For long range planning we are aiming for national distribution.  Naturally this involves coming 
East."" App. 82."
699,9," Suit was filed against both Falstaff and Narragansett, but as to the latter, the complaint was dismissed shortly after it was filed."
699,10," Hereinafter, reference to de novo entry includes ""toe-hold"" acquisition as well."
699,11," Over the objections of the Government, the District Court allowed post-acquisition evidence and noted in the opinion that the 
market share of Narragansett dropped from 21.5% in 1964 to 15.5% in 1969, while the shares of the two leading national 
brewers increased from 16.5% to 35.8%. "
700,12," See n. 8, supra, and accompanying text. "
701,13," In  FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 581 (1967), we found the acquiring company at the edge of the market 
exerted ""considerable influence"" on the market because ""market behavior . . . was influenced by each firm's predictions of the 
market behavior of its competitors, actual and potential""; because ""barriers to entry . . . were not significant"" as to the acquiring 
company; because ""the number of potential entrants was not so large that the elimination of one would be insignificant""; and 
because the acquiring firm was the most likely entrant. It is suggested that the District Court failed to consider whether Falstaff was an on-the-fringe potential competitor with influence 
on existing competition because the Government never alleged in its complaint that Falstaff was exerting a present 
procompetitive influence, never proceeded under this theory, and further failed to introduce any evidence to support this view.  
But this position merely ascribes an arbitrary meaning to the language of the complaint.  The Government in its complaint 
alleged that the acquisition violated § 7 because it eliminated potential competition; since potential competition may stimulate a 
present procompetitive influence, the allegation certainly encompassed the ""on-the-fringe influence"" that the District Court failed 
to consider, and the Government was not required to be more specific in its allegation. The Government did not produce direct evidence of how members of the New England market reacted to potential competition 
from Falstaff, but circumstantial evidence is the lifeblood of antitrust law, see Zenith Radio Corp. v.  Hazeltine Research, Inc., 
395 U.S. 100 (1969); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v.  United States, 306 U.S. 208, 221 (1939); Frey & Son, Inc. v.  Cudahy Packing 
Co., 256 U.S. 208, 210 (1921), especially for § 7 which is concerned ""with probabilities, not certainties,"" Brown Shoe Co. v.  
United States, 370 U.S., at 323. As was stated in  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U.S. 158, 174 (1964), ""potential 
competition cannot be put to a subjective test.  It is not 'susceptible of a ready and precise answer.'"" Nor was there any lack of circumstantial evidence of Falstaff's on-the-fringe competitive impact.  As the record shows, Falstaff 
was in the relevant line of commerce, was admittedly interested in entering the Northeast, and had, among other ways, see n. 8, 
supra, made its interest known by prior-acquisition discussions.  Moreover, there were, as my Brother MARSHALL would put it, 
objective economic facts as to Falstaff's capability to enter the New England market; and the same facts which he would have 
the District Court look to in determining whether the particular theory of potential competition we do not reach has been violated, 
would be probative of violation of § 7 through loss of a procompetitive on-the-fringe influence.  See  FTC v. Procter & Gamble 
Co., supra, at 580-581;  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., supra, at 173-177;  United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 
376 U.S. 651, 660 (1964). And as for the contention that the Government did not proceed under this on-the-fringe influence view, the record is to the 
contrary.  At one point in the trial, the Government informed the trial judge that a deposition was being introduced into evidence 
""to establish that Falstaff was a company that was on the wings or at the edge of the New England market. . . .  What I mean by 
that is that Falstaff was capable and interested in entering the New England market and would be waiting for the opportunity to 
develop, but that Falstaff, over the long term, would eventually or could eventually or was a likely entrant into the New England 
market, to use the terminology in FTC v. Procter & Gamble Company."" App. 124.  Further into its presentation of proof, the 
Government was introducing evidence of the trend toward concentration in the market, and stated: ""It is this concentration, your 
Honor, which, as we attempted to point out in our pretrial brief, makes potential competition. . . .  The concentration of sales 
within a small number of firms in New England.  This is what makes the potential competition . . . so very, very important to this 
market. . . .  In such a situation the potential entry of a fresh competitive factor is of extreme importance."" App. 170. That the on-the-fringe influence theory was one of the theories the Government was proceeding under was apparent to Falstaff.  
In its opening statement, Falstaff stated: ""Now, the Government has a theory which is, so far as the judicial determinations on the point are concerned, comparatively 
new.  You were handed the other day a portion of the record in FTC against Bendix-Fram Corporation, and you were handed at 
the same time a typed or otherwise reproduced copy of the opinion of Commissioner Elman of the FTC in that case. ""That opinion is not yet officially reported.  The case is on its way to an appeal . . . .  The Commissioner announced a theory 
upon which the Government relies and which they say lies within the ambit of this vague, undefined creature, potential 
competition.  What that decision, on appeal as I say, what that decision announces is the doctrine which is called the toe-hold 
doctrine, and it goes like this: ""If a producer of Product A is standing in the wings, as the Commissioner says, outside the market, merely standing there, but in 
a position to move into the market if he chooses.  He must remain there in the wings and forbear acquiring the producer of a like 
product within the market area. "
702,," ""The Commissioner fancies that the mere presence of such a manufacturer or seller close to the market area had some effect 
which could fall within his ill-defined concept of potential competition.  And he found in Bendix-Fram that Bendix was in such a 
position.  He found that Bendix could have acquired a small company rather than Fram, a relatively larger one, beefed it up by 
expenditures of money which Bendix could afford, and develop it into a full-blown competitor within the market area.  I do not 
know whether that notion will gain substantial acceptance in the theory of antitrust law.  I do not know that it will have the 
approval of the Supreme Court if and when it ever reaches it.  I do know, however, that that is an entirely different situation [than] 
we have here. . . . . . ""If there is any sense to this total theory at all it must be that the acquiring company was in fact so closely located to the market 
served by the acquired company that its entrance into the market unilaterally, under its own steam, without motivation was a 
distinct threat to those who were competing in the market."" App. 182-183.  (Emphasis added.) Falstaff then proceeded to state why it felt that the on-the-fringe influence theory did not apply in this case. During its proof, Falstaff had both its expert witness on economics, App. 257, and an officer of Narragansett, App. 376, testify as 
to whether Falstaff's presence had a procompetitive effect, both stating that it did not."
702,14," It is suggested that certain language in the Court's opinion in  United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 464 (1964), 
is to the contrary.  But there the merger was held proved prima facie anticompetitive because the acquiring and acquired 
companies were engaged in the same overall line of commerce in the same geographic market.  This notwithstanding, it is again 
only arbitrary to assume that the quoted language was not referring to the acquired company's on-the-fringe influence as a 
potential competitor for certain end uses for containers. "

705,8," Falstaff contended below that a de novo entry would not be profitable.  Management stated that an established distribution 
system was a prerequisite to entry.  The District Judge concluded that ""the credible evidence establishes that [Falstaff] was not a 
potential entrant into said market by any means or way other than by said acquisition.""  332 F.Supp. 970, 972. "
706,1," The Government's complaint alleged that the merger violated § 7 because ""potential competition in the production and sale of 
beer between Falstaff and Narragansett will be eliminated."" (Emphasis added.) While it is true, as the majority asserts, that 
""potential competition may stimulate a present procompetitive influence,"" see ante, at 534 n. 13, the complaint nowhere alleges 
that such a procompetitive influence occurred in this case."
706,2," Significantly, the majority cites no evidence at all from the record indicating that firms within the New England market were 
deterred from anticompetitive practices by Falstaff's presence at the market fringe. Indeed, my Brethren concede that ""the 
Government did not produce direct evidence of how members of the New England market reacted to potential competition from 
Falstaff,"" ibid.  While the majority contends that there was ""circumstantial evidence"" relevant to determining whether there was a 
loss of procompetitive influence, the evidence it points to suggests only that Falstaff might have been perceived as a potential 
entrant -- not that this perception produced a present procompetitive effect.  In fact, the little evidence on the question which 
does appear in the record strongly suggests that Falstaff was exerting no procompetitive influence.  Thus, an economist 
testifying for the defense stated that, in his expert judgment, Falstaff's presence on the fringe of the market ""had no effect"" on the 
practices of firms within the market (App. 257).  Similarly, the director of marketing for Narragansett testified that those within the 
market did not view Falstaff as a threat and that it never occurred to them that Falstaff would attempt a de novo entry (App. 376). To be sure, this testimony may well have been biased and might properly have been discounted by the trier of fact. But it is 
harder to dismiss the documentary evidence showing continued vigorous competition after Falstaff's entry by acquisition. If 
Falstaff was exerting a substantial procompetitive influence by threatening entry, it would seem to follow that anticompetitive 
practices should have emerged when this threat was removed.  The majority nowhere accounts for the continuing absence of 
such practices."
706,3," In its brief before this Court, the Government characterizes its cause of action as follows: ""The theory of the suit was that potential competition in the New England beer market may be substantially lessened by the 
acquisition."" Brief for United States 2-3."
706,4," Cf.   United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 651, 663 (1964) (opinion of Harlan, J.): "
707,," ""Both as a practitioner and as a judge I have more than once felt that a closely contested government antitrust case, decided 
below in favor of the defendant, has foundered in this Court for lack of an illuminating opinion by the District Court.  District 
Courts should not forget that such cases, the trials of which usually result in long and complex factual records, come here 
without the benefit of any sifting by the Courts of Appeals.  The absence of an opinion by the District Court has been a handicap 
in this instance."""
707,5," See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (a).  Cf.   United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., supra, at 656-657. "
708,6," This pressure continued during the post-acquisition period.  From 1964 to 1969, Narragansett's share of the market slipped 
from 21.5% to 15.5%, while Anheuser-Busch and Schlitz, two large national firms, increased their combined share from 16.5% to 
35.8%. "
709,7," At trial, Falstaff argued that it was unlikely to make a de novo entry into the New England market since it had learned through 
experience that a strong, pre-existing organization of distributors was essential to success.  It is true that Falstaff sold most of its 
beer through independent distributors.  However, it should be noted that between 20% and 25% of its sales were made through 
company branches which Falstaff had established itself.  As might be expected, Falstaff's profit margin was significantly higher in 
areas where it used its own distribution facilities.  Moreover, Falstaff's assertion is belied by its own prior history.  As noted 
above, for years Falstaff had successfully expanded by purchasing failing breweries with weak distribution facilities and turning 
them into effective competitors."
709,8," At trial, Falstaff also argued that the other Little recommendations which Falstaff did follow led to disastrous consequences, that 
Little's estimate of construction costs were unrealistic, and that the Little Report was premised on Falstaff's penetration of the 
mid-Atlantic as well as the New England market. "
710,9," Dr. Horowitz' estimates were based on the assumption that Falstaff's profit margin would be $ 1.16 per barrel, which was the 
margin currently enjoyed by the company.  However, Anheuser-Busch and Pabst, two of the larger national breweries, both 
earned more than $ 2.50 per barrel in their modern plants."
710,10," Ultimately, on March 6, 1972, Falstaff announced plans to acquire Ballantine's trademarks and tradename."
710,11," The original § 7 provided in relevant part: ""No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole 
or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such 
acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation 
making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of 
commerce."" 38 Stat. 731. "
711,12," The legislative history of the 1950 amendment was traced in detail in our opinion in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 
U.S. 294 (1962). ""The deletion of the 'acquiring-acquired' test was the direct result of an amendment offered by the Federal 
Trade Commission.  In presenting the proposed change, Commission Counsel Kelley made the following points: this Court's 
decisions had implied that the effect on competition between the parties to the merger was not the only test of the illegality of a 
stock merger; the Court had applied Sherman Act tests to Clayton Act cases and thus judged the effect of a merger on the 
industry as a whole; this incorporation of Sherman Act tests, with the accompanying 'rule of reason,' was inadequate for 
reaching some mergers which the Commission felt were not in the public interest; and the new amendment proposed a middle 
ground between what appeared to be an overly restrictive test insofar as mergers between competitors were concerned, and 
what appeared to the Commission to be an overly lenient test insofar as all other mergers were concerned.  Congressman 
Kefauver supported this amendment and the Commission's proposal was then incorporated into the bill which was eventually 
adopted by the Congress.  See Hearings [before Subcommittee No. 2 of the House Committee on the Judiciary] on H. R. 515, 
[80th Cong., 1st Sess.] at 23, 117-119, 238-240, 259; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on H. 
R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. . . . 147.""  370 U.S., at 317 n. 30."
711,13," To be sure, in terms of anticompetitive effects, the dominant firm's acquisition of another firm within the market might be 
functionally indistinguishable from a de novo entry, which § 7 does not forbid.  But ""surely one premise of an antimerger statute 
such as § 7 is that corporate growth by internal expansion is socially preferable to growth by acquisition.""  United States v. 
Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 370 (1963). Moreover, entry by acquisition has the added evil of eliminating one firm 
in the market and thus increasing the burden on the remaining firms which must compete with the dominant entering firm. "
712,14," Thus, whereas the practical difference between entry by acquisition and entry de novo may be marginal in the case of a 
dominant entrant, see n. 13, supra, it is crucial in the case of a perceived potential entrant. If the perceived potential entrant 
enters de novo, its deterrent effect on anticompetitive practices remains and the total number of firms competing for market 
shares increases.  But when such a firm enters by acquisition, it merely steps into the shoes of the acquired firm.  The result is 
no net increase in the actual competition for market shares and the removal of a threat exerting procompetitive influence from 
outside the market."
712,15," Still, even if the market is presently competitive, it is possible that it might grow less competitive in the future.  For example, a 
market might be so concentrated that even though it is presently competitive, there is a serious risk that parallel pricing policies 
might emerge sometime in the near future.  In such a situation, an effective competitor lingering on the fringe of the market -- 
what might be called a potential perceived potential entrant -- could exert a deterrent force when anticompetitive conduct is 
about to emerge.  As its very name suggests, however, such a firm would be still a further step removed from the exertion of 
actual, present competitive influence, and the problems of proof are compounded accordingly -- particularly in light of the 
showing of reasonable probability required under § 7."
712,16," However, if the acquired firm is strengthened to such an extent that it upsets the market balance and drives its competitors out 
of the market, the acquiring firm takes on the characteristics of a dominant entrant, and the merger may therefore violate § 7 
under that theory.  See supra, at 558-560 and n. 14. "
713,17," Thus, in  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U.S. 158 (1964), for example, management testified that the company 
had no intention of making a de novo, nonacquisitive entry,  id., at 166, and in part on the basis of this testimony, the District "
714,," Court found that such an entry was unlikely,  id., at 173. But we rejected this finding as irrelevant to the company's status as a 
perceived potential entrant since ""the corporation . . . might have remained at the edge of the market, continually threatening to 
enter,"" ibid., and so affected competition within the market."
714,18," Public statements by management that the firm does not intend to enter the market may be relevant.  To the extent that such 
statements are believed by the firms within the market, they affect their perception of the firm outside the market as a potential 
entrant. But in that event, the statements of intent are admissible, not to show subjective state of mind, but, rather, as one of the 
objective factors controlling the perception of the firms within the market. "
715,19," It might be argued that economic decisions are ""inherently subjective"" and that any attempt to derive objective conclusions 
from economic data is futile.  If this observation means that different people reach different conclusions from the same objective 
data, then the point must, of course, be conceded.  Similarly, if the point is that economic predictions are difficult and fraught with 
uncertainty, it is well taken.  As we recognized in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, such questions are ""not . . . 
susceptible of a ready and precise answer in most cases.""  374 U.S., at 362. But although the factual controversies in § 7 cases 
may prove difficult to resolve, the statutory scheme clearly demands their resolution.  As this Court held years ago, in response 
to a similar argument: ""So far as the arguments proceed upon the conception that in view of the generality of the statute it is not 
susceptible of being enforced by the courts because it cannot be carried out without a judicial exertion of legislative power, they 
are clearly unsound.  The statute certainly generically enumerates the character of acts which it prohibits and the wrong which it 
was intended to prevent.  The propositions therefore but insist that . . . it never can be left to the judiciary to decide whether in a 
given case particular acts come within a generic statutory provision.  But to reduce the propositions, however, to this their final 
meaning makes it clear that in substance they deny the existence of essential legislative authority and challenge the right of the 
judiciary to perform duties which that department of the government has exerted from the beginning."" Standard Oil Co. v.  United 
States, 221 U.S. 1, 69-70 (1911). Section 7 by its terms requires the trial judge to make a prediction, and it is entirely possible 
that others may reasonably disagree with the conclusion he reaches.  But a holding that the fact of such disagreement requires 
the judge to delegate his decisionmaking authority to one of the parties would strike at the heart of the very notion of judicial 
conflict resolution.  While it may be true that different people see economic facts in different light, § 7 gives federal judges and 
juries the responsibility to reach their conclusions as to the economic facts.  And ""if justice requires the fact to be ascertained, 
the difficulty of doing so is no ground for refusing to try."" O. Holmes, The Common Law 48."
715,20," The Government directs our attention to a case which dramatically illustrates the unreliable character of such evidence.  When 
the Government challenged Bethlehem Steel's acquisition of Youngstown Steel in a § 7 proceeding, Bethlehem vigorously 
argued that it would never enter the Midwestern steel market de novo.  But when the merger was disallowed, see  United States 
v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F.Supp. 576 (SDNY 1958), Bethlehem nonetheless elected to make a de novo entry.  See 
Moody's Industrial Manual 2861 (1966)."
715,21," It is possible to imagine a small, closely held corporation which is not solely concerned with profit maximization and which 
through excessive conservatism or inertia would not seize upon an opportunity to expand its profits.  But such a corporation is 
exceedingly unlikely to become the defendant in a § 7 lawsuit.  Section 7 suits of this type are triggered when a firm tries to 
expand its market by entering hitherto foreign territory by acquisition. A firm caught in the act of expanding by acquisition can 
hardly be heard to say that it is uninterested in expansion. It is also possible that a firm might make a good-faith error as to the nature of objective market forces.  Thus, even though the 
objective factors favor entry de novo, the firm's managers might think that the same factors are unfavorable.  But as the objective 
evidence favoring entry becomes stronger, the possibility of good-faith error correspondingly decreases, so that if the objective 
forces favoring entry are clear, the chance of good-faith error becomes de minimis.  Moreover, the mere fact that a firm is 
presently making a good-faith error does not demonstrate that it will continue to do so in the future.  See supra, this page. "
716,22," The distinction between subjective statements of intent and objectively verifiable facts is not unknown in other areas of the 
law.  See, e. g.,  Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 460-462 (1972);  NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 
221, 227-228 (1963). Indeed, perhaps the oldest rule of evidence -- that a man is presumed to intend the natural and probable 
consequences of his acts -- is based on the common law's preference for objectively measurable data over subjective 
statements of opinion and intent.  Nor have we hesitated to apply this principle to antitrust law.  See, e. g., Utah Pie Co. v.  
Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 702-703 (1967);  United States v. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394 (1948). "
726,*," Senior District Judge of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation. "
727,1," We set forth below a more complete statement of the litigation sequence that preceded this motion, including the plenary action 
out of which the motion arose."
727,2," The tender offer reserved to G&W the right to purchase any shares tendered in excess of that amount.  At the hearing in the 
district court, however, G&W informed the court that it would accept no more than 3,750,000.  G&W accordingly has returned all 
shares tendered in excess of that amount. "
728,3," G&W's motion claimed that A&P had violated the securities laws by false and misleading statements in both the February 2 
press release and the February 3 letter to shareholders. The district court rejected G&W's claims, based on the view ""that the 
alleged omissions were not material omissions and that the plaintiff has failed to show a reasonable expectation of success on 
the trial of the issues so as to cause this Court to issue the preliminary injunction sought by G&W.  Nor does this Court find these 
issues so difficult and doubtful as to tip the balance of hardship toward G&W and thus warrant the issuance of injunction . . . ."" 
G&W has not appealed from the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction."
728,4," The voting trust as originally drafted required disposal of the shares ""if G&W becomes the controlling shareholder of A&P"", 
defined as either being the ""largest single holder of common stock of A&P"" or having ""a majority of the members of the Board of 
Directors of A&P . . . designees of G&W."""
728,5," The specific items involved include paper goods, produce and meat, refrigeration equipment, and cigars, each of which are 
categories of goods which A&P purchases and G&W can supply.  It is further alleged that various financial services offered by 
G&W, not currently utilized by A&P, present further vertical foreclosure potential. "
729,6," The following depositions were taken, each of which was received in evidence without objection at the preliminary injunction 
hearing: Charles G. Bluhdorn (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of G&W) (by A&P); Joel Dolkart (General 
Counsel and Director of G&W) (by A&P); Ralph D. DeNunzio (Chairman of the Executive Committee of Kidder, Peabody & Co.) 
(by A&P); William J. Kane (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of A&P); (by G&W); and Byron Jay (former Chief 
Executive Officer of A&P, and Trustee of the Hartford Foundation) (by G&W)."
729,7," G&W called no witnesses, except that it cross-examined M. Dean Potts (Comptroller of A&P) on his affidavit. A&P called as witnesses William J. Kane, see note 6, supra; and John Guest, a member of the brokerage firm of Kuhn, Loeb & 
Co., who testified to a conversation with Bluhdorn concerning a proposed purchase of the Hartford Foundation's A&P shares."
729,8," The court denied that portion of A&P's motion which sought a preliminary injunction against Kidder Peabody on the ground that 
""there is no showing that Kidder Peabody was acting as anything but a stockbroker for G&W.  Apparently it had no knowledge of 
any possible wrongdoing by G&W and Bluhdorn."" No issue is before us on this appeal regarding Kidder Peabody, since no 
appeal has been taken from the denial of A&P's motion for a preliminary injunction against it. "
731,9," G&W's argument that, aside from its asserted lack of intent, there is no possibility of gaining control is not supported by the 
record.  That contention rests on the premise that the Hartford Foundation, and the various shareholding members of the 
Hartford family, together form a monolithic block with considerably more than 50% of the outstanding shares.  The district court 
concluded that the evidence showed no block voting among the various Hartford interests.  We agree. At the argument of this appeal, moreover, we were informed that the Foundation was not unwilling to reduce its interest.  Upon 
the announcement of the tender offer, the Foundation voted to tender some 1.5 million shares to G&W.  On February 14, it 
actually did tender 500,000 shares, although these shares were returned by G&W due to the oversubscription of the tender offer 
at that time. We note further that under the provisions of Section 4943 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 26 U.S.C. § 4943 (1970), the Hartford 
Foundation is in a position where divestment of a sizeable portion of its A&P holdings soon will be highly probable. In short, we 
find no basis in fact for the argument that the current dominance of the various Hartford interests precludes G&W control of A&P 
at some future date."
731,10," In Denver & Rio Grande Western R.R. Co. v. United States, 387 U.S. 485, 501, 18 L. Ed. 2d 905, 87 S. Ct. 1754 (1967), the 
Court held that, while the ICC's duty to consider anticompetitive effects of the acquisition of stock of a common carrier under 
Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. § 5 (1970), ""arises only after the threshold fact of control is established, no 
such preliminary finding need be made to trigger the ICC's duty under the Clayton Act. A company need not acquire control of 
another company in order to violate the Clayton Act."" See also United States v. E.I. duPont deNemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 77 
S. Ct. 872, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057 (1957). "
732,11," While A&P's recent performance may be said to have been lackluster, the data provided in its own response to the tender offer 
negates any possible claim that it is ""failing""."
732,12," The FTC has found distinct trends toward concentration in both the food distribution and grocery products manufacturing 
industries. 1 CCH TRADE REGULATION REPORTS para. 4525, at 6904; para. 4530 at 6908 (1971)."
732,13," Section 14(e) reads in pertinent part: HN6[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material 
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer 
or request or invitation for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer, 
request, or invitation."""
732,14," Our Court has had occasion to construe § 14(e) on at least four previous occasions.  Butler Aviation International, Inc. v. 
Comprehensive Designers, Inc., 425 F.2d 842 (2 Cir. 1970); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787 (2 Cir. 
1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 27 L. Ed. 2d 50, 91 S. Ct. 41 (1970); Iroquois Industries, Inc. v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 "
733,," F.2d 963 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 909, 26 L. Ed. 2d 561, 90 S. Ct. 2199 (1970); Electronic Specialty Co. v. 
International Controls Corp., 409 F.2d 937 (2 Cir. 1969). A&P's standing, as the target corporation of a tender offer, to bring suit under § 14(e) for a preliminary injunction against G&W, 
the offeror, is clear.  Butler Aviation Int'l, Inc. v. Comprehensive Designers, Inc., supra, 425 F.2d at 843 n. 1; Susquehanna Corp. 
v. Pan American Sulphur Co., 423 F.2d 1075 (5 Cir. 1970). See also Electronic Specialty Co. v. International Controls Corp., 
supra, 409 F.2d at 940-41, 944-46."
733,15," That there are shareholders in this situation is clear from the record.  The Josephine H. McIntosh Foundation, for example, 
tendered only 200,000 of its total 1,100,000 shares of A&P common stock."
733,16," Former SEC Chairman Cohen has made some especially relevant comments on the importance of disclosing an intended 
change of control: ""Information about a potential change in control can be particularly essential to an informed decision.  A change in control 
brings with it the possibility of different operating results and different investment results, or perhaps the possibility of 
realizing on a company's liquidation value.  This may be either good, or bad, depending on the facts and circumstances 
involved.  But no investor can reach a conclusion on the possible effects of a change in control until the facts are available 
to him."" Cohen, A Note On Takeover Bids and Corporate Purchases of Stock, 22 Bus.  Law. 149, 151 (1966), quoted in, 
Moore v. Greatamerica Corp., supra, 274 F. Supp. at 493."
733,17," As additional basis for this inference (at least as of an earlier date), see note 4, supra. "
734,18," It appears that G&W also has failed to comply with the requirements of Section 14(d) of the 1934 Act and Regulations 14d-1 
through 14d-4, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.14d-1 to 14d-4 (1972).  Section 14(d) requires that a tender offer which will result in more than 
5% ownership of the target company cannot be made until the offeror files a Schedule 13D with the Commission providing 
specified information.  Item 4 on Schedule 13D in part requires that the following information be provided: ""Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction. State the purpose or purposes of the purchase or proposed purchase of securities of the issuer.  If the purpose or one of 
the purposes of the purchase or proposed purchase is to acquire control of the business of the issuer, describe any plans of 
proposals which the purchasers may have to liquidate the issuer, to sell its assets or to merge it with any other persons, or 
to make any other major change in its business or corporate structure . . . . ."" G&W did not supply such information -- in violation of § 14(d). "
735,19," G&W argues that after April 3 the tendering shareholders have the right to withdraw their tendered shares, thereby effectively 
destroying the tender offer. Suffice it to note that the provision of the Williams Act referred to, 15 U.S.C. § 78n(d) (5) (1970), 
merely gives shareholders the option of withdrawing; it says nothing about re-solicitation of those shares; and indeed it 
authorizes adding to the attractiveness of the tender offer. 15 U.S.C. § 78n(d) (7). "
739,1," The district court denied defendants' motion for a directed verdict as to Count V.  On joint motion of both parties, the court 
continued the hearing of Count V until decision by this Court of the present appeal.  Under these circumstances, we intimate no 
view concerning the issues raised by Count V, except to note that the potential liability of the individual plaintiffs on their 
guarantees made to secure the borrowings of E.D. Foods, Inc. may be covered by this Count. "
740,2," HN2[
] Under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, federal courts have power to adjudicate claims based upon state law 
whenever there is a substantial federal claim ""and the relationship between that claim and the state law claim permits the 
conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional 'case'."" United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 
U.S. 715, 725, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966). Exercise of the power is discretionary and depends upon such 
considerations as judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants.  Id. at 726."
740,3, See id. at 725.
740,4," In this regard, it is appropriate to note that plaintiffs' failure to satisfy their burden of proving the amount of damages ""was so 
only because Farmington chose to rely almost entirely on one expert witness and one lay witness for its proof of damages.  Any 
inadequacy which may have resulted should be attributed to Farmington's own presentation of its case rather than to the law or 
the court's application of it here."" Farmington Dowel Products Co. v. Forster Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 61, 83-84 (1st Cir. 1969). "
746,1," At the same time, however, the trial court noted that it refused to submit to the jury the issue of fraud in the procurement of the 
patent. See Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 
347 (1965)."
746,2, Hammons acquired the controlling interest in Gravette in August of 1966. 
747,3," The Perry Patent Reissue indicates that the shells to be used were those ""having the hardness of black walnut shells,"" as well 
as, black walnut shell alone. The patent ""contemplates the use of pellets of other types of ground or cracked nutshells having 
equivalent characteristics"" of black walnut shell. The testimony of both parties indicated that apricot pit shell and black walnut 
shell have similar hardness, resilience, and resistance to breakdown characteristics. "
749,4," In the judgment the district court did not explicitly state whether the product claims would have been infringed by the Hammons 
product if the patent was valid. But in the trial of the antitrust counterclaim the same district judge referred to the Hammons 
product as an ""admittedly infringing product."""
749,5," During the trial of the antitrust counterclaim the trial judge explained why he did not award attorneys' fees to Hammons in the 
patent case: ""I had read the few cases that are in the books under it [35 U.S.C. § 285] and to me, the determining factor was a question of 
good faith and I -- whether I had the proper interpretation of good faith or not, I came to the conclusion there was no question 
that the plaintiffs [Agrashell] thought they had a valid patent, they were trying to uphold what they thought was a valid patent, 
and they brought the suit in good faith in that sense * * *."" "
751,6," Although the trial judge commented that the ""Statement of Policy"" pertained to the intent issue under section 2, Hammons' 
proof also presented the ""Statement of Policy"" in terms of section 1. "
754,7," Evidence that Western Electric did not consider the products interchangeable is the fact that during the three years that 
Agrashell made no sales in the Columbus market (1963-1965), Hammons' sales did not increase as a result. "
755,8," When Dr. Kuhlman was asked why Hammons failed to attempt to sell to Agrashell's ultimate consumers, he was unable to 
explain other than by vaguely referring to restrictions wherever Agrashell sold through an agent. To the contrary, Dr. Poe, 
Agrashell's expert, could find nothing in the agreements or Statement of Policy which would impose a barrier to the ultimate 
consumer. In fact, if Agrashell held up its price, it should be expected that another seller could come in and sell at a lower price. "
758,9," Of the three manufacturers sued or threatened with suit by Agrashell (Block, Gravette, and Hammons), Block continued to 
produce SGA throughout the periods relevant here, Hammons sales nearly doubled, and Hammons acquired the controlling 
interest in Gravette in 1966."

proceed.  Only the complaint and matters recognized by both parties as encompassed by judicial notice will be considered. "

95."
777,7," The issues of standing and remoteness are virtually indistinguishable in the case law.  In that regard, this court would certainly 
agree with the statement of Chief Judge Arraj in Wilson v. Ringsby Truck Lines, Inc., supra, at 701, that: ""We must confess at the outset that we find antitrust standing cases more than a little confusing and certainly beyond our 
powers of reconciliation.  The statutory provision about which there exists so much uncertainty itself seems straightforward: This language suggests that to bring a private action for violation of the antitrust laws a litigant need only allege that he has 
been injured, or is threatened with injury, by conduct which violates an antitrust law.  However, because a treble damages 
award can be a severe penalty for a defendant and a 'windfall' for a plaintiff, numerous federal courts have developed rules 
designed to limit the classes of plaintiffs which can assert an antitrust violation."""
777,8," In this court's opinion, the consumers of shoes manufactured by Hanover Shoe would probably, under existing doctrine, have 
been held to have been ""too remote"" to recover damages against United Shoe under the facts of that case.  However, that is so "
778,," because the injury to consumers was consequential and difficult to measure in light of the fact that the overpayments were 
initially reflected in shoe machine leases.  The fact that the consumers were not in ""privity"" with United Shoe is certainly 
irrelevant to any cause of action they might have under § 4 of the Clayton Act."
778,9," For example, a jury finding that an overcharge had been passed-on, particularly by a party in contractual privity with the alleged 
antitrust violator, would preclude relitigation of the same issue by the ""passing-on"" party (e.g. the initial purchaser) who is higher 
up in the distributive chain. See, Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois, 402 U.S. 313, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788, 91 S. 
Ct. 1434 (1971)."
778,10," Not only were the consumer plaintiffs (intervenors) in Allis-Chalmers remote from the standpoint of damages (i.e., overcharges 
on electrical equipment would have had to have been converted to higher electricity costs to the consumers), but jurisdiction 
over utility rate matters lies with the Illinois Commerce Commission, which is where plaintiffs probably should have gone.  See, 
Cummings v. Common-wealth Edison Co., 64 Ill. App. 2d 320, 213 N.E.2d 18 (1965). "
779,11," It is interesting to note that Judge Miles W. Lord, sitting by designation in the broad spectrum antibiotics antitrust litigation, 
rejected the claim by purchasers of finished animal feed products containing the antibiotic drug that they had standing to sue the 
drug manufacturers. Although the Philadelphia Housing Authority case is cited approvingly, the factors considered by Judge 
Miles Lord speak more to the issue of remoteness rather than ""privity"".  He noted that the affidavits filed by plaintiffs did not: "". . . . refute the fact that the plaintiffs asserting these claims did not purchase antibiotic drugs in the form sold by the 
defendants nor do they tend to establish that the manufacturers and distributors of medicated animal feed containing 
antibiotic drugs 'passed along' any illegal 'overcharge' in the cost of the terramycin by a pre-existing cost-plus contract or 
other analogous fixed mark-up arrangement.  Instead, the facts suggest that the antibiotic product, once incorporated in the 
finished feed, passed through a second market composed of apparently competitive sellers, obscuring any effect the 
alleged antibiotic drug conspiracy might have had on the price of finished feed.  The difficulty of plaintiff's case is greatly 
increased by the problems of competition, price determination, advertising and merchandising in the finished feed market, 
all of which enter into any determination of whether they felt the impact of the conspiracy. ""The court's conclusion concerning this aspect of the plaintiff's case is buttressed by the Second Circuit's recent discussion 
of Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968), in the course of 
its affirmance of the settlement reached before Judge Inzer B. Wyatt in many of the broad spectrum antibiotic actions.  
West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 440 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir. 1971), affirming, 314 F. Supp. 710 (S.D.N.Y. 1970)."" The settlement referred to by Judge Lord involved retail consumers of the antibiotic drugs and the drug companies.  At both 
the trial court and the appellate court levels, various wholesalers and retailers objected to the allocation of or the 
participation in the settlement by consumers. Both courts rejected the notion that Hanover Shoe precluded consumers from 
recovery on the basis of lack of standing, although both courts intimated that even if the decision established such a rule, 
the situation was probably covered by the 'cost-plus' exception.  See, State of West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., supra, at 
1088, where the court stated: ""In Hanover Shoe itself Justice White placed strong emphasis on the Court's desire to encourage private treble damage 
actions. ""These ultimate consumers, in today's case the buyers of single pairs of shoes, would have only a tiny stake in a lawsuit 
and little interest in attempting a class action. In consequence, those who violate the antitrust laws by price fixing or 
monopolizing would retain the fruits of their illegality because no one was available who would bring suit against them.  
Treble-damage actions, the importance of which the Court has many times emphasized, would be substantially reduced in 
effectiveness. ""Keeping these comments in mind, there are then several obvious distinctions between the principles laid down in Hanover 
Shoe and the present case.  First, the passing-on doctrine is not here being used as a defense to permit the defendants to 
escape liability, but rather as an attempt to award damages, insofar as is possible, to those who ultimately paid higher 
prices as a result of the collusive pricing, and to avoid giving a windfall gain to those who rather clearly were not injured.  
Secondly, to permit the use of the doctrine in the present circumstances will not act to limit or frustrate private treble-
damage claims, but will, if anything, do the opposite."" The same argument was similarly rejected when raised in a motion for judgment n.o.v. following a finding of liability for antitrust 
violations by a jury.  Leland Portland Cement Company, et al. v. City of North Bay Village, No. Misc. 2364 (S.D. Fla.), 
interlocutory appeal denied (5th Cir., April 6, 1972). "

790,4," Although it is not always persuasive that an appellate court sub silentio confirmed a rule that was not challenged, our own 
Court of Appeals has surely not thought such an assumption to be untenable.  In Gottesman v. General Motors Corporation, 414 
F.2d 956 (1969), Judge Feinberg noted in a case which the Supreme Court decided on a statute of limitations ground, 
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., 381 U.S. 311, 14 L. Ed. 2d 405, 85 S. Ct. 1473 
(1965) that ""although the issue was not discussed, the Court evidenced no qualms about dealing with a Section 7 money 
damage claim."" 414 F.2d at 960. The analogy is close. "
792,5," ""GAF alleges that the $730,000 in 'lost profits' was 'based upon the difference between what [the profits on] GAF's sales to 
Circle Floor normally would have been in those years.  GAF does not allege that it was unable to sell floor tile, only that it could 
not sell the 'normal' amount to Circle Floor; there is no factual allegation that GAF had been injured in its business due to a 
decrease in total sales."" 463 F.2d at 759. "
797,6, At no time after 1949 did the volume of banana traffic equal the 1948 volume.
797,7, By stipulation of the parties it is this date that is determinative of the statute of limitations.
797,8," The New York Court of Appeals, after holding the question of freight rates separable, held ""the rest of the agreements 
supported by independent consideration."" 8 N.Y. 2d at 438. The Referee had listed seven benefits to IRCA.  While the 
agreement not to build a port on the West Coast was held to be a sham in Ripley the agreement to ship bananas exclusively via 
IRCA was itself a detriment to UF. Even if the contract falls for lack of mutuality that is not enough reason to spell out an implied obligation of such a vague nature 
as the obligation to ship an unexpressed number of bananas. Not every contract that may fail for lack of consideration is revived 
by Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, supra.  An important element must be whether it is likely that if the parties intended such 
obligation they would not have expressed it. "

804,6," Consignees who maintain inventories, unlike ordinary salesmen of the manufacturer, from the customer's point of view, look and act like ordinary merchants.  They operate stores or other establishments.  They 
not only ""sell"" the goods to customers, but they maintain an inventory, provide storage, arrange for delivery into the 
customer's possession, and often supply service, repair and financing facilities.  If the customer has a recognized interest in 
price competition between dealers in the manufacturer's brand, he will have the same interest if the manufacturer-dealer 
relation takes the form of consignment. It was recognition of this functional interest in competition among consignees which 
underlay the result in Simpson. Rahl, Control of an Agent's Prices: The Simpson Case -- A Study in Antitrust Analysis, 61

804,7," This is assuming that a finding of coercion is necessary before a vast distribution system which maintains fixed price schedules

(1955). ""The term res judicata is used broadly in the Restatement to cover merger, bar, collateral estoppel, and direct estoppel."" 
Id. n. 6. "
807,9," Engelhardt v. Bell & Howell Co., 327 F.2d 30 (8th Cir. 1964), while viewing Lawlor somewhat differently, is plainly 
distinguishable from the case at bar.  In Engelhardt both suits were based on a single breach of contract, only one refusal to deal 
and only a single transaction. Vogelstein v. National Screen Service Corp., 204 F. Supp. 591 (E.D. Pa. 1962), aff'd, 310 F.2d 738 (3d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 
374 U.S. 840, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1061, 83 S. Ct. 1894 (1963), which also took a somewhat different view of Lawlor, rested in large 
measure on a stipulation by which plaintiff agreed to be bound by the results in six other antitrust suits involving the same issues 
as his later suit. Insofar as Engelhardt and Vogelstein differ from the views as to the effect of Lawlor expressed here, I do not follow them. "
808,10," General Electric suggests that even if the 1926 decision of the Supreme Court is not res judicata here, Judge Forman's 
decision in the 1949 case is.  The suggestion is based on the premise that the ground for Judge Forman's decision in the 1949 
case was that the 1926 case was res judicata as to the lamp agency issues presented in the case before him. The record does not sustain G.E.'s premises.  What Judge Forman said was: It now appears that the exposure of the same issue a second time is barred by reason of the rule of res adjudicata.  
Whether the decision is induced by that doctrine or estoppel upon the part of the Government to raise the question again or 
by the precedent created by the 1926 case is immaterial.  82 F. Supp. at 827. Clearly, the 1949 decision did not turn on res judicata, as that term is used here.  Apart from this, since the cause of action in the case at bar is different from the cause 
of action before Judge Forman, a res judicata defense even were it based on a prior holding of res judicata, is not available to 
G.E. here. "
809,11," It may be borne in mind that, absent a significant change in the law, the doctrine of collateral estoppel serves the same 
policies of finality as res judicata. Had there not been a significant change in the law, collateral estoppel would apparently have 
served that purpose here. "

companies, mail-order houses, bank charge card systems, for information collected by local credit bureaus relevant to credit 
ratings of locally residing individuals."
827,2," The insurance reporting market was defined by the court as the gathering and the sale to insurance companies of information 
about prospective insureds, to guide the companies in making underwriting decisions, i.e., the determinations of whether to 
issue policies and, if so, what premiums to charge. As defined by the court, this market includes both reports used for life and 
health policies and fire and casualty policies."
827,3," CBR alleged that these acquisitions had the § 7 proscribed effect of lessening competition in both nonlocal credit reporting and 
insurance reporting. The court, however, determined that RCC's acquisitions violated § 7 by assessing their effect only in the 
nonlocal credit reporting market. See infra Part 2, at 993. "
829,4," RCC contended at trial that insurance companies would not accept reports prepared in the usual manner of CBR's credit 
reports, from telephone conversations. RCC's insurance reports were prepared from data obtained through its investigators'

them by appellees, were ""overt acts"" in furtherance of the conspiracy in restraint of trade. The court agreed with the trial judge, 
however, that the appellants had received consideration for the release or an adjudication of their rights.  It did not evaluate on

the use of exclusive territorial agreements with its private distributors between 1964 and 1970 to be in violation of Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act. When plaintiffs filed their supporting memorandum on January 23, 1973, the second part of the original motion 
had been eliminated and the present second part, which is set out above in the opinion, had been substituted.  I have

of Columbia Circuit held that the Armory Board of the District was not immune from antitrust liability when it granted a 30 year 
exclusive lease to the Washington Redskins which provided that they be the only professional football team to occupy the 
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. Perhaps that Court was influenced by the length of the lease to find that governmental immunity was not available to shield the 
armory board from liability from violation of the Sherman Act prohibition against contracts in restraint of trade.  Or perhaps that 
Court was influenced by its interpretation of the case of Woods Exploration & Production Co., Inc. v. Aluminum Co. of 
America, 438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), -- an interpretation this Court believes was overly broad and which exceeded the intent 
of the Fifth Circuit.  Nevertheless, the ruling in Hecht is not controlling in this case and is, therefore, not applicable. "

952,1," 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and 14."
952,2," Of the exhibits to which objection was made, the Court used 410, 1016, and the depositions of Kidd, Elser, and Donald 
Mitchell.  It did not use 425, 432, and 433.The statement of Boschetto was mainly cumulative of other testimony. "
953,3," Southern ICEE was the original developer. It split in early 1966 into Southern and National.  New National acquired most of 
National's rights about October 1, 1968.  Western was created about the same time, and acquired some of National's territory."
953,4," In addition to subleasing machines to others, in some territories developers placed machines in profitable locations themselves.  
This latter method of doing business is not directly involved here."
953,5, He also founded Southern.
953,6," Except for Southern which never was a defendant, apparently because these plaintiffs dealt with the other three developers but 
not with Southern.  Western is no longer a party, however, since the case against it has been transferred to another district.  
New National has been dismissed from the case since plaintiffs gave it a covenant not to levy."
953,7," Throughout the record the various interests are referred to by a variety of labels, sometimes confusing."
953,8," All these plaintiffs bought their franchises from National.  After the transactions in October, 1968 (see fn. 3), most dealt with 
New National, although some dealt with Western."
953,9," Although ICEEquip took over the ICEE Division in May, 1968, its separate existence is largely ignored by both sides.  The 
Court will do likewise. "
954,10, The monthly rental was later reduced.
954,11," These various payments tended to vary over the years, and the developers occasionally levied additional charges which 
sometimes led to disputes with Mitchell as well as sub-developers."
954,12," In practice sub-developers frequently were unable to collect the $400 from the retailers and also frequently arranged to take a 
given percent of the retailer's gross ICEE income in lieu of per-cup charges."
954,13, The sub-developers paid the franchise fees before starting business.
954,14," At first they ordered through the developer, however.  See infra , p. 18 et seq."
954,15," At first Harry's stocked and shipped the cups itself.  Later it simply brokered them, and the cups were shipped from 
warehouses of the Maryland Cup Company. "
955,16," Except for the areas where they operated machines themselves.  See fn. 4, supra ."
955,17, There is a formidable array of lesser tie-in claims which are discussed infra .
955,18," As previously noted, defendants Devine and National have not argued or briefed their position."
955,19," The full accusation of tie-ins in the pre-trial order, after mentioning the trademark-machine tie and the cup-trademark/machine 
tie was ""[Defendants'] unlawful tying arrangements involved the ICEE process or system as the tying product; or the ICEE process or 
system as the tied product, with the FCB Machines, and the Trademark, separately or together, each, or both together with the 
process or system, as tied or tying products; and each or all singly or in various combinations, or all together, were tying 
products to the cups; and tied the ICEE process or system, as the tying product, to the franchise fee requirements for illegally 
tied territorial restrictions, to royalty payments for illegally tied trademark restrictions on cup purchase and use, and to rental 
payments on illegally tied FCB Machine use."" There are a staggering number of permutations here which plaintiffs do not develop separately in their argument.  All may be 
disposed of either for the reasons given in the text of this opinion, or for obvious logical reasons. "
956,20," There was conflict in testimony whether competing machines produced an identical product.  However, Mitchell's vice 
president testified that the children who usually bought it wouldn't be able to tell the difference, at least with respect to one 
competing machine."
956,21," Therefore, the Court does not consider the other defenses, e.g. the necessity for quality control. "
957,22," With respect to the cups, plaintiffs assert variously that the machines, the trademark, and the ""ICEE process or system"" are 
the tying product.  The question then is whether the allegedly tying product is the franchise (see fn. 34, infra ) or the 
machine/trademark. The former includes the right to use the latter.The Court will refer exclusively to the franchise as the tying 
product since it is the more inclusive term and since it is most doubtful that an analysis of the latter would reach a significantly 
different result than of the former."
957,23," The supply contracts with the sub-developers gave them a choice of two methods of computing the royalty due defendants.  In 
lieu of exclusive cup purchases, they were permitted to install water meters on the machines and pay a royalty per ounce of 
water.  However, no sub-developer ever used this method.  The few who inquired about it were told that it was not available and 
was not seriously intended to be used.  It was undisputed that water meters were unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons.  They 
could not be used with hard water; several gallons might be run through them in the course of routine servicing of the machine, 
thus creating unbearably high cost to the sub-developers; they were delicate and easy to become maladjusted; and, of course, 
none were available.  One reason so few sub-developers were even mildly interested was that even if a water meter worked 
accurately, the resulting royalties were higher than when measured according to cup purchases.The sub-developers had to pay 
1.25 cents, 2 cents, and 3.50 cents for 9, 14, 18 and 24 ounce cups, respectively, when they chose the exclusive cup purchase 
method.  Using the water meter, the royalty would have been one cent per ounce.  The record doesn't indicate how many 
ounces of water were actually required for each of these cup sizes, but the testimony was that water meter royalties were 
designed to be unacceptably expensive.  In fact, the only reason the water meter alternative was even mentioned in these 
various contracts was nervousness about the legality of the exclusive cup purchase requirements."
957,24," The Court does agree with defendants that Mitchell had no anti-competitive intent in connection with the exclusive cup 
purchases.  Its main interest was to establish an efficient meter pricing system; this was the simplest one it knew of.  The 
developers' intent may have been a little different, considering the different way they arranged for royalties. See discussion infra 
, p. 19. "
958,25," However, the ultimate resolution of this question must await the trial on damages, when plaintiffs may show that they would 
not have been charged the same had there not been an exclusive cup purchase requirement."
958,26, See fn. 23.
958,27," At least once, Mitchell considered competitive bids from various cup manufacturers and explicitly decided to choose only one, 
rather than several."
958,28," Considerations such as this, as well as defendants' claim that they were able to get the lowest price because of volume 
orders, may be appropriate in the damage phase of the trial."
958,29," Of course, Mitchell was entitled to insist on using a uniform specially printed ICEE cup. Siegel, supra . "
959,30, At that time it was neither leasing machines nor collecting royalties.
959,31, The exact date is unimportant now since this is not the damage phase of the case.
959,32, Harry's also must have agreed to sell ICEE cups only to approved purchasers. 
960,33," The supply agreement recited that the royalty was consideration for ""supplying the ICEE cups, instruction of service men, the 
furnishing of business guidance, and performing other obligations under this agreement …"" National could raise the royalties if 
its own cost of cups rose, but in 1971 it still had not done so, despite intervening increases in cup costs."
960,34," It is not entirely clear what plaintiffs mean by the ""ICEE process or system"" which they allege has been unlawfully tied to the 
machine and trademark. Probably they refer to the entire bundle of business methods associated with operating as a franchise 
system. "
961,35," A typical clause in the contract of sale granted one plaintiff: ""the exclusive and perpetual right to develop and maintain the 
leasing and servicing of Icee Dispensers, and in connection with the sale, distribution, or lease of any product processed by the 
Icee Dispensers the right (exclusive of all other persons, except seller and Mitchell) to use the Trade Mark ""ICEE"" and the 
distinctive ""Polar Bear"" identified with the Icee business, in the following geographic area (""The Territory""); in the State of 
Oregon, the Counties of Washington, Multnomah, and Clackamas.  In the State of Washington, the County of Clark."" Developers 
also warranted that they had not conveyed such rights to anyone else and that they would not do so in the future.  Furthermore, ""Seller further warrants that he will not sell Icee Dispensers to anyone other than Buyers in The Territory and that he will assert 
all rights to which he has to prevent the sale of Dispensers by Mitchell to others than Buyers or Seller in The Territory … ""Buyers' exercise of the rights granted by this sale is limited exclusively to the geographical area of The Territory."""
961,36," Developers not only sold franchises but also operated territories themselves directly, just as the sub-developers did.  See fn. 
4, supra .  Mitchell reacquired some of the sub-developers through a wholly owned subsidiary, ICEE Co.  See fn.  , infra .  
However, plaintiffs have not claimed that the territorial restrictions were horizontal restraints."
961,37," Mitchell sold machines in the United States before the birth of its franchise system; sold outside the United States more or less 
continuously; sold within the United States after the renegotiation of the agreements in 1970 and 1971; and, theoretically, offered 
for sale machines at all times.  In the latter case, the price was set at over $8,000, and succeeded in its purpose of absolutely 
discouraging sales. "
962,38," It should be noted that the developers do not even have the justification which Mitchell had, i.e., retention of title, and Mitchell 
is accused of combining with the developers. "
963,39," This latter defense was raised in the pre-trial order and then sank from sight without a mention.  The Court likewise declines to 
discuss it, except for noting that the allegedly illegal price fixing occurred in more states than Oregon."
963,40," The contract provided: ""Retailer agrees to pay to Service Representative the following amounts of royalty for each cup of ICEE dispensed by the 
dispenser: ""Five Cents (5 ) for each Nine Ounce (9 oz.) cup; ""Seven Cents (7 ) for each Fourteen Ounce (14 oz.) cup; ""Nine Cents (9 ) for each Eighteen Ounce (18 oz.) cup; and ""Ten Cents (10 ) for each Twenty-Four Ounce (24 oz.) cup."""
963,41," See the discussion, supra pp. 25 and 26. "
964,42," Another purpose of the lease-only provision was to enforce the territorial restrictions.  See discussion infra , p. 35."
964,43," Defendants have not claimed any ""new business"" justification.  Cf.  Siegel, supra ."
964,44," About the only evidence is a paragraph in the Mitchell Co. bulletin in 1971 which did little more than announce the formation of 
ICEE Co. and the acquisition of three local franchises, with the intent to continue if successful. "
965,45," The development contract between Mitchell and Devine and Montalvo of October 14, 1965, is a good dividing line."
965,46," Similar previous contracts were ""exclusive,"" however.  See discussion infra pp. 35."
965,47, Except in four states. 
966,48, Mitchell's vice president. 
967,49," But the arrangement did serve its interest in collecting revenue, and made it possible for the developers to enforce the 
exclusive cup purchase requirement, whether or not it had the latter purpose in mind. "
970,1, A class determination has not yet been made under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c) (1).
970,2," Subsequent to the completion of the briefing of the instant motions, JWT filed a second amended complaint without leave of 
Court.  As it has not yet determined whether such leave should be granted, the Court does not consider here the allegations 
made in that pleading."
970,3, JWT also seeks a judgment under 15 U.S.C. § 115(b) (7) cancelling Kobrand's trademark registrations for Beefeater gin. 
971,4," See also Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp. , 337 F. Supp. 1234, 1236 (E.D. Pa. 1972)."
971,5," It is useful to point out here that it is nowhere claimed that Kobrand's alleged discriminatory fair trade enforcement is part of a 
conspiracy between it and the allegedly favored retailers. If that were the case, JWT might well have a claim regardless of the 
validity of the fair trade program itself.  See United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, Inc. 324 U.S. 293, 295-97 (1945); Beverage 
Distrib. Inc. v. Olympia Brewing Co. , 440 F.2d 21, 32 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 906 (1971); ABA Antitrust Section, 
Antitrust Developments 1955-1968 118 (1968); Eiger, Fair Trade in Illinois , 56 Ill. B.J. 836, 842 (1968). "
972,6," In reaching this conclusion, the Court has of course construed the McGuire Act exemption strictly.  United States v. McKesson 
& Robbins, Inc. , 351 U.S. 305, 316 (1956)."
972,7," The Court is not unsympathetic to JWT's situation if Kobrand is discriminating in favor of large retailers. Indeed, the result of 
such discrimination would be in direct conflict with the purpose of the fair trade laws to afford relief to small merchants from the 
price cutting of the large chains.  Comment, Resale Price Maintenance and the Anti-Trust Laws , 18 U. Chi. L. Rev. 369 (1951). 
But small retailers are not without a remedy even if they cannot show a conspiracy between the fair trader and their competitors, 
as is suggested for a possible basis of an antitrust claim in note 4[5] of this opinion.  Their principal remedy is that of self help; 
they may simply disregard the stipulated prices and rely upon the discriminatory enforcement defense when they are sued.  In 
fact, the record shows that JWT raised such a defense in Kobrand Corp. v. J.W.T., Inc. , No. 70 CH 5272 (Cir. Ct. of Cook 
County) before that case was settled.  It may also be that small retailers have a cause of action as ""[persons] damaged"" under 
the Illinois Fair Trade Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, § 189, against such large retailers. Huerbinger Drug Co. v. Topp's of Niles, 
Inc. , 28 Ill. App. 2d 336, 170 N.E. 2d 653, 654 (1960)."
972,8, Kobrand submitted an example of this form with the affidavit of its regional manager. 
973,9," JWT's other contentions regarding the construction of § 126 are equally untenable and merit little discussion here.  The most 
plausible of these is that because the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, § 60-1 et seq. , would prohibit such territorial 
restraints, § 126 should not be construed to allow them.  Of course, the two statutes should be construed to avoid a conflict if 
possible but to construe the liquor control provision in the manner suggested by JWT would render much of it inoperative.  Under 
such circumstances the well-known canon of construction favoring the more specific statute controls.  The Antiturst Act prohibits 
restraints of trade generally, but § 126, for whatever reason, clearly sanctions a particular type of restraint in a particular 
industry. "
978,1," The text of the proposed agreement was as follows: WHEREAS, the contractor and the union desire to make an agreement applying in the event of subcontracting in 
accordance with Section 8(e) of the Labor-Management Relations Act; "
979,," WHEREAS, it is understood that by this agreement the contractor does not grant, nor does the union seek, recognition as 
the collective bargaining representative of any employees of the signatory contractor; and WHEREAS, it is further understood that the subcontracting limitation provided herein applies only to mechanical work which 
the contractor does not perform with his own employees but uniformly subcontracts to other firms; THEREFORE, the contractor and the union mutually agree with respect to work falling within the scope of this agreement 
that is to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting or repair of any building, structure, or other works, that if 
the contractor should contract or subcontract any of the aforesaid work falling within the normal trade jurisdiction of the 
union, said contractor shall contract or subcontract such work only to firms that are parties to an executed, current, 
collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 100 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the 
Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry. "
981,2," Sec. 6.  HN3[
] That the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce. Nothing contained in the anti-trust 
laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for the 
purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such 
organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be 
held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws."
981,*," * * Sec. 20.  HN4[
] That no restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the 
judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between 
employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning 
terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party 
making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be 
described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney. And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating 
any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others 
by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose 
of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from 
working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading 
others by peaceful and lawful means to do so; or from paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such 
dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful 
purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor 
shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States."
981,3," (c) HN6[
] The term ""labor dispute"" includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning 
the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or 
conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee. "
984,4," Justice White delivered what was styled as the majority opinion, with Chief Justice Warren and Justice Brennan concurring in 
his opinion. Justice Douglas, with Justices Black and Clark agreeing, concurred with an opinion. Justices Goldberg, Harlan and 
Stewart dissented from the opinion but concurred in the result. "
988,5," At this point the countervailing arguments with respect to freedom of choice of the employees and the argument that nonunion 
contractors provide a legitimate anti-inflationary function by helping hold down wages unions would otherwise demand if they 
had an entire industry sewed up are, indeed, very difficult questions which have to be faced, but the instant question is whether 
or not they are to be faced in this suit. These policy concerns are of a type dissimilar to the rationale underlying antitrust policy. 
These arguments are far more germane to labor law issues. Assuming, as we must, that Congress truly meant to approve 
elimination of that competition based on differences in labor standards and wages and insulate such a result from antitrust attack 
absent a conspiracy to monopolize, it becomes clear that other public policies, such as freedom of choice, are to be protected in 
an alternative manner. As will be discussed infra, it seems that Congress has indeed tried to maintain all competing policies which Connell seeks to 
have apply. In doing so, however, Congress has chosen to act through the specific labor statute, not under the more general 
antitrust laws. "
989,6," In his Jewel Tea opinion, Justice Goldberg specifically pointed to the problem facing courts in applying the broad Sherman Act 
provisions: . . . Union restrictions on contracting out and subcontracting of work are delineated by § 8(e) of the Act. For the issue 
presently before us, it is most significant that in enacting this last prohibition, Congress in the exercise of its legislative 
judgment, specifically excepted the unusual situations existing in the garment and building industries. Such exemptions for 
particular industries, which may be proper subjects of legislative discretion, would, of course, be most difficult for courts to 
make in employing a broad proscription like the Sherman Act. We might add that construing the meaning of such a legislatively-created labor law exception in the context of an  anti-trust 
action is equally, if not more, difficult. "
990,7," Our consideration of the precise sections of the National Labor Relations Act leads us to the conclusion that this activity, if not 
expressly protected by the statute, is conclusively prohibited. This is discussed in Section VIII, infra. "
992,8," (e) HN13[
] It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or 
agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, 
selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other 
person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such 
extent unenforcible and void: Provided, That nothing in this subsection (e) shall apply to an agreement between a labor 
organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the 
site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work."
992,9," If the word ""employer"" is read to exclude Connell in the proviso, then it seems that the word ""employer"" in the general ban of 
section 8(e) would have to be read in the same manner, thus, leaving this activity totally unregulated by this section of the 
statute. "
993,10," Since we have determined that there is no antitrust cause of action in this case as it is alleged, we do not find it necessary to 
pass on whether or not Congress, by the 1947 and 1959 amendments to the NLRA, intended to automatically preclude antitrust 
attacks for secondary boycotts even when a more traditional Allen Bradley conspiracy is alleged. In this regard see the opinion "
994,," of Justice Goldberg in Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. at 708, n. 9, and the comments of Justice Stewart in his dissent in National 
Woodwork Manufacturers, 386 U.S. at 652, et seq. "
995,1," 29 U.S.C. § 158, particularly sub-sections (b)(4)(ii), (b)(7)(C) and (e)."
995,2, 29 U.S.C. § 159.
995,3, 29 U.S.C. § 187. 
996,4," Sections 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 17, 29 U.S.C. § 52) and Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act (29 U.S.C. § 
104)."
996,5," Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940); United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 61 
S. Ct. 463, 85 L. Ed. 788 (1941)."
996,6," Cedar Crest Hats, Inc. v. United Hatters, 362 F.2d 322 (5th Cir. 1966), is not to the contrary. There this court stated: In order for union activity to constitute a violation of antitrust laws in the circumstances here presented, there must be a 
combination of union and nonunion business groups to create a monopoly, resulting in a restraint of trade or interstate 
commerce. "
996,362," F.2d at 326 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). In Cedar Crest Hats the court specifically found that the union activity was 
protected by the labor acts. Thus that case did not purport to consider antitrust immunity in the context of an unfair labor practice 
such as is present in Connell's case. "
997,7," Arguably Mr. Justice White might even condemn some contractual provisions which were mandatory bargaining subjects if 
such provisions had only a remote and indirect effect on wages, hours, and working conditions. See Justice White's opinion at 
381 U.S. at 689-690, 85 S. Ct. at 1602; and Justice Goldberg's concurrence, 381 U.S. at 727, 85 S. Ct. at 1623. Compare 
Teamsters Local No. 24 v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 79 S. Ct. 297, 3 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1959)."
997,8," As Judge Morgan points out, six judges in Jewel Tea held that there was no sustainable allegation of conspiracy with nonlabor 
groups. The other three judges, spokesmaned by Mr. Justice Douglas, would have found the requisite conspiracy in the 
collective bargaining agreement signed by the employers. Under that analysis this case too would involve a conspiracy if 
employers other than Connell had also agreed to boycott non-Local 100 subcontractors, since the contractors could not have 
agreed among themselves to boycott certain subcontractors any more than they could have agreed to fix prices or allocate 
markets. Thus the Douglas opinion in Jewel Tea would also find the agreement here within the scope of the Sherman Act if, as 
seems likely, other employers had also agreed to the boycott. Apparently Justice Douglas's opinion is predicated on the view 
that the union concern in marketing hours was not ""immediate and direct;"" there is no indication as to whether such concern is 
co-extensive with mandatory bargaining subjects. "
998,9," See, e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959); Fashion Originators' 
Guild of America v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949 (1941); Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Ass'n v. 
United States, 234 U.S. 600, 34 S. Ct. 951, 58 L. Ed. 1490 (1914)."
998,10," Not all union misconduct constituting an unfair labor practice should entail a loss of union antitrust exemption; only that 
conduct which violates the congressionally-protected commercial rights of neutral parties would normally fall without the 
exemption. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for this dissent to attempt a complete catalogue of that labor law illegal 
conduct which falls without the exemption. Suffice it to say that since Section 8(e) is designed and intended to protect neutral 
parties from concerted boycotts required by union activity, a violation of that provision under circumstances similar to those here 
will place a union beyond the scope of the exemption."
998,11," The rule which I would follow may bear a superficial resemblance to Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 41 S. 
Ct. 172, 65 L. Ed. 349 (1921), which Apex Hosiery declared to have been effectively overruled by the enactment of the Norris-
LaGuardia Act. The critical distinction, however, is that the reasoning I favor draws its sustenance from the express declaration 
by Congress that secondary picketing is not a legitimate union tool, except where it is expressly permitted. "
1001,12," No claim based on Section 8(b)(7) is presented here. Compare Building Construction Trades Council of Philadelphia, and 
Samuel E. Long, Inc., 201 NLRB No. 42 (1973). "
1011,1," Texasgulf's Original Complaint filed on July 27, 1973, three days after the tender offer was made, states in Paragraph VI, ""On 
or about January of 1973, CDC began a searching investigation of Texasgulf with a view toward attempting to acquire this 
worldwide natural resources and mining company.  Beginning in March of this year it secretly began to acquire the common 
stock of Texasgulf on the open market until shortly prior to its announced takeover attempt it had acquired 748,000 shares or 
approximately 2 1/2% of the outstanding common stock of Texasgulf, thereby making the Canadian government one of the 
largest stockholders of Texasgulf and the largest Canadian stockholder."""
1011,2," Record at 1923.  The complete and final closing argument of the distinguished attorney and director of Texasgulf is set out in 
full below to demonstrate how Texasgulf views this case. ""MR. PHILLIPS: If you please, Your Honor. ""Heretofore, may it please the Court, I had not thought it appropriate to take an active part in this hearing.  I had thought it more 
appropriate to take a passive and a silent part.  My reason for that position, I think, is obvious. ""The first case I ever tried, or really the first case of any real importance, was assigned to me by a Mr. Jesse Andrews.  I had the 
honor of trying that case in this court before one of your truly great and distinguished predecessors, the Honorable T. M. 
Kennerly.  My client was Texasgulf. "
1012,," ""A few years before that, Your Honor, I had been brought to Houston as a country boy, not dried behind the ears, dirt poor, and 
honestly with an ignorance that bordered only ignorancy.  The man who brought me here, Frank Coates, died, and literally died 
in the service of Texasgulf. ""And now, for the past few years, I have had the privilege of serving as a director on the board of this company, and so it must 
be obvious to Your Honor that much of my career and much of my personal life has been identified with Texasgulf. ""It has been claimed that management, and I suppose I am a part of management, is seeking to perpetuate itself in power, 
entrench itself in keeping our jobs.  And as ludicrous as those charges may be, I suppose it's nevertheless true that it could be 
claimed that anything I might say was suspect and self-serving, and so, I was content to remain passive and silent until I read 
the concluding brief filed in this case.  And in that brief, I'm sorry to say, you will find that these lawyers have gone much further 
than claiming that management is seeking to perpetuate itself in power.  We are accused of bringing to this Court trumped up 
and spurious charges.  We are accused of engaging in one sham ploy after another.  It is claimed that we are motivated by 
paranoic force - I believe that's the phrase that has led us to misleading the Court, engaging in deleterious tactics and pursuing 
false and frivolous accusations. ""These are the charges, may it please the Court, that no lawyer is obliged to sit and endure in silence, and so, with your 
indulgence, I should like to make a brief reply. ""I realize the hour is late, it's past your usual adjournment time.  I assure you I won't take long. ""I would begin by asking this Court to take a broad overview of what here is at issue.  Because it is at the very threshold that we 
find ourselves in sharp dispute with the other side.  There is no doubt that if this case is tried eventually on the merits, it will 
indeed be a complicated and an involved case.  But at the moment, right now, this court is only concerned with whether, in the 
exercise of sound discretion, it will or will not grant a preliminary injunction. It is here at the threshold that we find the first 
dispute. ""It is our position, to put it as simply as I may, that in order to resolve this matter, the Court need ask itself only three simple 
questions: First, is there a public interest to be protected?  We do not claim, we have never claimed that this court or any court 
has the right to make national policy or make any new law.  But neither, Your Honor, do we accede to the view that this court or 
any court may close its eye to the public interest when this court or any court is called up to exercise sound discretion.  And may 
heaven help us if the day ever comes when in the administration of justice this court or any court must ignore public interest. ""The second question, has there been a clear showing of sufficiently serious questions that present fair grounds for further 
investigation and for a trial on the merits?  It seems to us that this court may answer this question in the negative only if the court 
is also willing to say that now for three weeks we have engaged in frivolous, sham, scurrilous ploys.  If this court really believes 
that, you should deny this preliminary injunction. ""Third, this court must ask itself if the balance of hardships tips it decidedly in favor of the plaintiff.  Put another way, is this an 
indication for the maintenance of the status quo until there can be a ferreting out of all of the facts and a resolution finally of the 
difficult questions that have been presented. ""We say those are the three questions that you must ask.  Our authority is stated in our brief. ""Let me, at the risk of being repetitious, because it seems to me highly important for this Court to understand what is the 
standard, what is the issue, I quote from a very recent case: 'The settled rule is that a preliminary injunction should issue upon a 
clearer showing of sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of 
hardships tipping decidedly toward the power requesting the preliminary leave.' In these past three weeks, the illusion has been 
created, if so, accidentally, that this has been a trial on the merits.  The hearing has lasted longer than many trials on the merits.  
The evidence has been sharply conflicting, and I think it's safe to say that every point has been contested.  And, Your Honor, 
while this obviously is not a trial on the merits, let me ask you for just a moment to continue the illusion. ""Suppose, Your Honor, that you had a jury sitting over here in this box and that at this moment you were faced with the necessity 
of deciding what to do, whether to withdraw the case or to submit it to the jury.  What would Your Honor do?  Take the evidence 
and the issue of conspiracy. There's no doubt about it.  The evidence and the testimony is in sharp conflict.  Bear in mind, if you 
please, that the courts have said time and time again that conspiracies are not hatched in the light of day, and conspirators 
rarely confess. ""Take the evidence, which Mr. Harvin has outlined here, of conspiracy, picking them off point by point.  Do not ignore, and 
indeed you should not ignore the evidence that has come in from this side of the table.  Would you permit a jury to decide the "
1013,," question of whether this was in fact a conspiracy? It is my firm conviction that in the state of this record, as it exists today with 
only three days of discovery, the record would require Your Honor to submit the question of conspiracy to a jury. ""If we are charged, Your Honor, with playing frivolous games, and we are so charged, the necessary conclusion that they must 
also urge is that this court itself has been a willing participant in that frivolous game, and why?  Surely, if our case was built on 
sham, it wouldn't have taken this court three weeks to find it out.  And if our case was so weak and so spurious and so 
unfounded, this court would have cut this hearing short ten days ago and would have granted them a motion to dismiss the case. ""The court did not do that, and the court was right in not doing it.  But, when the court decided to hear all of the evidence, the 
court was also, it seems to me, branding as incorrect the charge that this is frivolous and that this is a sham.  That can't be so. ""Let's take for the moment Article 1527, about which obviously we are in sharp disagreement.  It must be claimed by these 
lawyers, and they have so claimed it, that our 1527 is so clearly inapplicable that it doesn't even raise a serious question.  I want 
you to look for just a moment, if you please, as to what happened on this hearing.  I want you to examine the claim of a lawyer-
client privilege.  I am not quarreling with Your Honor's ruling.  I happen to think it was right.  There are some privileges, for 
example, that fifth amendment privilege so constitutionally sacred that no one is allowed to comment upon or even draw 
inferences in claim of that privilege.  Such is not the case with the lawyer-client privilege. ""Why?  It's a fair question, we think.  Did not these lawyers waive the claim?  Why did they not bring before Your Honor their 
legal opinions that were written prior to the making of this tender offer? It is certain they had such an opinion.  If that legal 
opinion demonstrated, written before any lawsuit was ever filed, demonstrated that there was no serious question, don't you 
know that they would have waived the privilege and presented to you that legal problem?  But what did they do? ""MR. HUTCHESON: Excuse me, Your Honor. ""THE COURT: We don't have a jury. ""MR. HUTCHESON: Sir? ""THE COURT: We don't have a jury here. ""MR. HUTCHESON: At the proper time, I would like to reply. ""THE COURT: Sir? ""MR. HUTCHESON: I simply -- I'm sorry I interrupted Mr. Phillips.  I first make that apology, but I believe from what he is now 
doing, he is attempting to argue the presumed contents of opinions, and I believe that's clearly outside of the evidence of the 
case, and I wanted to respectfully object to it. ""THE COURT: Thank you. ""MR. PHILLIPS: I have not gone outside of the record, Your Honor, but I'll leave that to you. ""What did counsel do?  They brought here for two days Professor Lebowitz who teaches corporation law at the University of 
Texas, had him right here in this courtroom.  Finally they got from him an affidavit.  They now ask Your Honor, if I understood Mr. 
Hutcheson correctly, that you must see that or may consider it even though you excluded it. ""What you did, Your Honor, was to invite these lawyers to put the professor on the witness stand because you can't cross-
examine an affidavit, but if they had put Professor Lebowitz on the witness stand, the court could have asked the professor 
some questions about 1527, and so could we. ""And is there any conclusion to be drawn that they found it to their best interest not to accept your invitation and not to put him 
on the witness stand?  And in the light of that record, can they now convince you there is no serious question with regard to the 
application of 1527? ""Let's look at the conflict of interest. This has occupied a goodly portion of the Court's time.  Let's go first to a few basic facts. ""Our system of free enterprise, as I understand it, has been brought on in large part upon private corporate endeavors.  Our 
government cannot control or buy the ownership of a Texas corporation.  Witness a few years ago our Supreme Court striking 
down, even though there was then said to be a national emergency, the act of President Truman in seizing control of a private 
corporation steel mill.  Any person, whether he be black or white, or whether he be an alien or American, has a right to become a 
stockholder in an American corporation.  And he does so for one purpose.  He does so in order to provide himself with an 
opportunity, sometimes unwisely, to make a profit on his investment.  The director who sits on the board of directors owes to that 
stockholder and to every stockholder the unquestioned loyalty of acting in his best interest.  That's one side of the coin. "
1014,," ""Let's look at the other side.  The takeover attempt to which this court is here concerned is a direct intervention in the affairs of a 
domestic corporation by an arm of the Canadian Government.  It seeks control of that corporation.  And we say, Your Honor, 
that this presents an inherent, inevitable conflict of interest. This is simply something because any objective and fair reading of 
the CDC act shows a clear mandate to give priority to the development and the utilization of Canadian natural resources. ""One of the highlights of this hearing, Your Honor, came, at least for me, in a colloquy question that you engaged in with one of 
the witnesses.  I must be honest and tell you I don't remember exactly the context, and I'm certainly not trying to interpret the 
Court's remarks, but I'll never forget them.  The Court said to one of the witnesses, as I understood it, in substance, that 
governments are transitory while nations are not.  And how true that is.  And the government of Canada is transitory and the 
board of directors of CDC is transitory.  The only thing constant, Your Honor, is that every government and every succeeding 
government always claims that it is acting in the best interest of its citizens. ""Let me come quickly to the point though.  It is completely obvious, however, well meaning Mr. Hampson, Mr. Crowe were in 
their statements of their intentions, however honest they were, they can no more bind the government of Canada or the next 
board of CDC directors than I can.  The protestations that they make that will act in the best interest of all stockholders, we won't 
favor Canadian natural resources, are meaningless because a fair interpretation of that fact or an interpretation that can be 
taken by the next Canadian government can be to the opposite, and the point is demonstrated by the fact that while Mr. 
Hampson was testifying just a few days ago on July 25th, a spokesman in the House of Parliament, speaking on behalf of the 
acting Prime Minister, said that this acquisition is to promote the development of what?  Canadian natural resources. ""Let me come to the balance of the equities.  Mr. Hutcheson says that our arithmetic is bad when we claim to protect the holders 
of 20 million shares of Texasgulf stock, and maybe he's right.  Maybe he's right, but he wants to knock off out of that 20 million 
shares those held by Canadians.  Well, that gets us down, I guess, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent, and we take, 
we ask, we have misgivings of about standing here and asking this Court to protect 15 million shares of Texasgulf stock half of 
the stockholders. It is said, and he's right, that occasionally, perhaps more often than not, the grant of a preliminary injunction 
kills a tender offer. That's true where you have private financing, that's true where the average private company who makes a 
tender offer can't keep its money tied up.  But, surely, it must be clear to Your Honor that here we are not dealing with such an 
entity.  Imagine a company that can get the largest loan in the history of the bank, $160 million, get it in a matter of two or three 
days and not even tell the bank what it's going to use the money for.  That's the government, and I dare say, if I were running 
that bank under the supervision of the Canadian government, I would let them have $160 or $200 million, if they wanted it, and 
they will have no trouble, if this court holds this matter in abeyance, by making another tender offer at a later date when and after 
this court has resolved, if it ever does, the serious questions that favor CDC, but what happens on the other side? ""Mr. Harvin started this case with a statement that this is a case of international significance.  It's an awesome responsibility that 
you must bear.  The consequences of what you do or what you don't do here are so far reaching that I can't perceive them in 
their entirety, and I doubt if this Court can either.  All that we are asking in the final analysis is the right to have a fair and a full 
trial on the merits.  Your Honor gave us accelerated discovery for which we are most grateful.  We had only three days of 
discovery.  Are we to be stopped there?  It would be like stopping the investigation of Watergate after the seven first defendants 
were convicted. ""If this preliminary injunction is not granted, we may never have a trial on the merits.  I am not talking scare talk, I am talking 
practicality of the most realistic kind.  In the evidence here, there is a plan that if this tender offer is consummated, a special 
meeting of the stockholders can be held.  As Your Honor realized that not only can that stockholders' meeting be held, but that 
each and every one of the eleven directors can be voted out of office and an entirely new slate put in, and then this case 
dismissed, but even if it's not dismissed, suppose just one, just one of these serious questions are resolved against Mr. 
Hutcheson's contentions, then they will suffer the irreparable injury, if not by the holders, Mr. Hutcheson, of 20 million shares, 
certainly by the holders of 15 million shares.  They are entitled to be protected, Your Honor. ""Denial of this right to Texasgulf, in my opinion, is not only the denial of Texasgulf, not only a holding by Your Honor that we 
have engaged in frivolous and sham tactics, but it also comes down to a holding that Texasgulf will not even have the right, 
under procedures fair to both sides, to investigate the truth and to ask this Court at a subsequent date to resolve these issues in 
a deliberate, in a careful and in a manner that is inherently traditional to the fair place that is invited in our judicial system of 
government. ""We ask that the preliminary injunction be granted. ""THE COURT: Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips."" "

Q You will see here that on this Defendant's Exhibit 27 under date of August 8th, 1973, Mr Lutsky, the reporter, says: 'Reached at his farm ner Sommerville yesterday, Mr. Streit laughed and said that his request for the shareholder's list was made 
on his own behalf.' See that in the newspaper? A Yes, sir. Q Are you telling the Court that nobody has mentioned to you that that was published in the paper yesterday? A No, sir. I haven't had a chance to catch up on these. Q He said he ws not under any direction or control by anyone. He is a shareholder in Texasgulf, but describes himself as 'a 
small fish.' Now, no one advised you about that statement by Mr. Streit? A No, sir. Q Would you agree, in the light of that document, Dr. Fogarty, that you were maybe wrong, your belief about Mr. Streit.? A It could be wrong, yes. Q Now, is there, please, anyone else in your company that you designate whom you feel would or might or probably would have 
more detailed information about Mr. Streit's alleged connection or non-connection with Noranda? Is there anyone in a better position than you to know this? A I don't think so. Q Now, please look at paragraph 17 of the Complaint, Dr. Fogarty, on page 6, there before you, and you see reference in the 
last sentence there: 'Five days later, however, defendant Streit still acting under the secret control and direction of Noranda, renewed his request to 
Texasgulf for a shareholders' list in a letter to Texasgulf dated July 9, 1973.' Now, is there any other fact that you haven't testified to here that led you to make that allegation about Streit's relationship? A No, sir, just the facts of the letter of July 9 requesting the shareholders list again written by his lawyer. Q And you then have told us everything that leads you to believe this connection between Streit and Noranda. Is that correct? A I believe so. Q Now, yesterday, Dr. Fogarty, you testified about heavy, strong interest in Texasgulf owned by Anglo-American. Isn't that correct? Do you recall that? A Yes, I do. Q What is Anglo-American, briefly? What company is it? A It's Anglo-American Company, Anglo-American Company or Corportation of Canada. Q What business is it engaged in? A Essentially, it's in the mining business, holding company. Q And it has about how many shares of stock in Texasgulf, if you know? A I really don't know even yet, sir. "
1030,," Q But it has, I believe you said, substantial block? A it has been rumored, listening to rumors only, we have information by the rumor route only that they hold 600,000 shares or 
they could hold, but we have no verification of that in our transfer list. Q I believe you testified one of the rumors was they might be trying to make a takeover of Texasgulf or to make a tender offer or 
something of that nature. Is that correct? A Correct, that was the rumor. Q Is there anything that causes you to believe that Mr. Streit was not acting for Anglo in making this inquiry, if he was acting for 
anyone but himself? A We have not way to assess that, Mr. Hutcheson. Q He could have been acting for Anglo, could he not, if he was not acting for himself? A You mean if he was not acting for Noranda or himself, he could have been acting for Anglo? Q Yes. A I suppose he could. Q Did you ever ask the Anglo people whether he was acting for them? A We have had no communication with the Anglo people."" The Court would observe that this answer series is typical of the response given by Plaintiff's witness to questions concerning 
the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint. Consequently he admitted his allegations were on information and belief and could 
enumerate no facts to substantiate them. The Court is mindful of the caution which should be used in examining such allegations. As stated in Marshall Durbin Farms, Inc.

powers attendant to the stock are exercised to bring about a lessening of competition.  There was evidence at the hearing that 
while CDC spoke in terms of ""effective control"" in its tender offer, it was mainly concerned with making a solid investment, and 
had made no decision on changes it would make by exerting its control.  Indeed some testimony indicated that even if they 
attained 35% of the stock there was still a strong likelihood of them not getting control since management would still control the 
proxy machinery.  Thus should this in fact turn out to be an investment, Section 7 would be inapplicable. "

Court whether you have an opinion as to whether the act imposes any constraints or restrictions upon representatives of CDC 
who would attempt to sit upon the board of Texasgulf, assuming the tender offer was successful? ""A. I think I must respond in two states, sir, to that question. ""First, I direct myself to the act itself whch is a statutory charter for the corporation which the directors of the corporation must 
obey. I interpret the act, and specifically the objects of the incorporation to require that the directors of the Canada Development 
Corporation at all times give priority to and emphasize industrial development in Canada. ""It follows from that, in my interpretation of the act, that those directors must also require any nominees on the board of a 
company in which they have acquired or will acquire an interest to further the objectives of the Canada Development 
Corporation. Otherwise, within the framework of the act, it would seem to me to be beyond the proper power of the Canada 
Development Corporation to make the investment in the first place. ""In other words, Your Honor, if it's not their intention to, by the investment, further the objectives of the Canadian Development 
Corporation as set out in the statute, then it seems to me that that is clearly as a matter of law beyond their power. That would 
therefore impose upon any directors whom they caused through one way or another to be elected to the board of Texasgulf, the 
constraint of serving the objectives of the Canada Development Corporation. ""If in the eventuality the directors appointed to the board are elected to the board of Texasgulf happen to be directors of the 
Canada Development Corporation, it would seem to me that those individuals would themselves be subject to that specific 
constraint in a very direct way as directors or officers if they happen to be officers and not directors of the Canada Development 
Corporation. ""If the eventuality were that the nominees put forward by Canada Development Corporation as a shareholder of Texasgulf were 
neither officers nor directors of the Canada Development Corporation, it seems to me those still, as a matter of law, looking at 
the Canada Development Corporation Act, that the duty would lie upon the officers and directors of Canada Development 
Corporation to use their best efforts through whatever devices they may have to influence those men or women to exercise their 
power as nominees of the Canada Development Corporation as a shareholder of Texasgulf to further the objectives of Canada

the four subclauses set out there, all of which summarizing briefly, refer to some aspect of Canadian interest. ""For example, the first clause talks about the creation or development of business resources, properties and industry of Canada.  
And this theme is carried forward throughout that section of Statute that is the heart of the company's charter with regard to its 
objects, and therefore the framework within which it must operate. ""That's supported by the, as I stated before, the title of the Statute, the general statements of the purpose of the Act, and the 
other supporting sections which relate to the investment by the government of Canada and its continuing interest in the 
corporation. ""Even on the face of the Statute, one must assume, I think, that the responsibility of the government in making a major 
investment in such a corporation is to do so only for the purpose of national development."" "

available in Australia, and it would have seemed to me, it's so readily available that it would seem to me that someone 
engaged in this type of a tender offer or takeover attempt could have called an attorney in Australia and in a matter of a few 
days he could have put together a tremendous amount of information relative to this subject, sir. I think they could have looked at the signed documents that we have with the Australian government and they could have

them. ""Q Now, my question is whether that same information is available to members of the public in the United States? ""A No, sir, in that detail, it is not. ""Q All right, sir.  I thought maybe you were suggesting I should go to Australia to get clear on it, Doctor, but I gather you 
mean now that somebody from Canada Development should have, in your opinion, gone there before they made this 
tender offer to see what they could find on this record about the management contract, is that correct? ""A No, sir, I'm not suggesting that they go there, although it's a wonderful country to visit, I can assure you.  I think they 
could have telephoned and found some attorney, corresponding attorney, if that's what you call them, someone in Australia

1064,4," Defendants do not challenge the district court's determination that the statute was tolled until certiorari was denied, and not just 
until May 28, 1968, which was 90 days after filing of the Third Circuit opinion, and thus the final date on which appeal of the 
Clayton Act finding was possible. The district court reasoned ""that once an FTC proceeding to enforce Clayton Act Section 7 has 
been instituted, the statute of limitations is tolled until the proceeding is finalized and not merely until the Clayton Act aspects are 
finalized."""
1064,5," The 1955 amendment to Clayton Act § 5 actually became effective on January 7, 1956 changed the language ""any suit or 
proceeding in equity or criminal prosecution"" to its present form of ""any civil or criminal proceeding."" The district court reasoned 
that an F.T.C. proceeding would not have tolled the statute of limitations before the amendment because the proceeding did not 
conform to the pre-amendment language, but that F.T.C. proceedings did conform to the post-amendment language and thus 
tolled the statute even for proceedings instituted prior to the amendment's enactment. It, however, held that the statute was not 
tolled retroactively as of the date the F.T.C. proceeding began; but, rather, that the statute was tolled as of the date the 
amendment became effective. "
1066,6," The district court stated: While we are impressed with the reasoning expressed in the above three cases [Rader, In re Antibiotic, and Lippa's], we are 
constrained to follow the apparent distinction recognized in the New Jersey Wood case. 336 F. Supp. at 1240."
1066,7," F.T.C. findings of F.T.C. Act violations were made final by the Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 111 (1938), 15 U.S.C. § 45(g); 
F.T.C. findings of Clayton Act violations were not made final until the Finality Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 243 (1959), 15 U.S.C. § 21. "
1068,8," The district court tolled the statute on the basis of the F.T.C. proceeding for Clayton Act violations. Although the F.T.C. 
proceeding commenced January 19, 1954, the district court said it could not have tolled the statute until January 1, 1956. See 
footnote 5 supra.  We find no such infirmity in the F.T.C. proceedings as of January 19, 1954. In revising Clayton Act § 5 in the 1955 amendment, Congress recognized that the merger of law and equity in the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure in 1938 made anachronistic § 5's reference to ""any suit or proceeding in equity;"" thus, it amended the 
language to read ""any civil or criminal proceeding."" The amendment did not therefore create any substantive change in Clayton 
Act § 5's characterization of F.T.C. proceedings. In holding in New Jersey Wood that F.T.C. proceedings tolled the statute of limitation, the Supreme Court made no distinction 
between the post and pre-1956 language. See majority opinion, 381 U.S. at 320-21, and dissent, 381 U.S. at 327. The two 
opinions disagreed, not on the basis of what the 1956 amendment meant, but on construction of legislative history in 1914. 
Implicit in the majority opinion is the conclusion that an F.T.C. proceeding was not only a ""civil proceeding"" under the post-1956 
statute, but also a ""proceeding in equity"" under the pre-1956 statute."
1068,9," The F.T.C. Clayton Act § 7 allegation concerned Luria's purchases of competing brokers. This Clayton Act § 7 violation is also 
alleged in the private suit sub judice.  We need not reach the issue of whether F.T.C. proceedings pursuant to the Clayton Act in 
1954 could have tolled the statute with regards to this aspect of the private suit, because Luria's purchase of competitors was 
also alleged by the F.T.C. in 1954 to be an F.T.C. Act § 5 violation. The F.T.C. Act allegation therefore tolled the statute with 
regards to these acquisitions, whether or not the Clayton Act allegations could have done so independently. "

1083,9," The intention of the plaintiffs is clear.  They sought to bring the primary line claim in expectation of maintaining a class action. 
The proof in a primary line claim is common to the class as to liability, as opposed to the individual nature of a secondary line 
claim.  As evidence of their intent to bring the primary line claim because of the easy proof, they were careful to note that it was 
their contention, once primary line liability was proven, secondary line damages could be collected if also proven. "

older children. Specific titles include ""Daredevil,"" ""Venture into the Unknown,"" ""Astounding Tales,"" ""Tales to Astound,"" and 
""Sergeant York."""
1087,2," Apparently there exists a good size market for these no longer current comics. There was testimony that these off-sale comics 
were distributed by Williams' wholesalers to ""mom and pop"" type stores which did not handle current cover comic books, and 
which could sell these off-sale comics for only four or five cents per copy. As appellant testified: ""A comic book, if a certain 
person has never read it . . . it is the same as new to the party purchasing it."" "
1088,3," A premium is a comic book given away to children by a businessman as a gift or in a prize-bag in order to attract business. 
Comic book premiums do not compete with current cover comics because they are not sold to the public."
1088,4," This court has reviewed various aspects of similar litigation between these parties in the past. See Independent News Co. v. 
Williams, 293 F.2d 510 (3d Cir. 1961), where we framed the issue: Can a second-hand periodical dealer who purchases cover-removed comics from waste paper dealers be enjoined under 
any one of six different legal theories, from marketing them as reading material? "
1088,293," F.2d at 511. (Emphasis supplied.) More recently, in 1968, Independent unsuccessfully sought an injunction against what it considered conversion by Williams of 
its literary property right in certain coverless comic books.  404 F.2d 758 (3d Cir. 1968). Appellee contends that the present action is barred by Rule 13(a), F.R.Civ.P., because it should have been asserted as a 
counterclaim to one of these earlier actions because it arose out of the same ""transaction or occurrence"" which was the subject 
matter of Independent's claim. Appellant argues that the factual and legal issues involved here bear no relationship to the issues 
of the earlier litigation, primarily because those cases dealt with coverless comics, an item which appellant deems an essentially 
different commodity from full-cover comic books. Because we affirm the judgment of the district court on the merits, we need not 
decide whether there exists the requisite relationship between these issues to bar this action. "
1089,5," The contract states: (g) . . . In the New York metropolitan area, and in such other areas as Publishers request in writing, Distributor will use best 
efforts to obtain full copy returns, and in such case Publishers agree to pay for return transportation and such handling 
charges as are required. . . . "
1090,6," The dissent strives to dilute the exclusive dealing arrangement. This sentence is quoted at 1109 and the suggestion is made 
that it forms the basis from which the jury might conclude that the exclusive dealing arrangement did not cover the sale of 
returned comics. Having said this, the dissent immediately concedes that Sampliner testified that the agreement extended to off-
sale full-copy returns as well as current comics. Specifically, this was the testimony: Q.  In other words, Mr. Sampliner, it was your understanding that under the terms of your agreement with Magazine 
Management, P9, that Independent News was the exclusive distributor for the off sale full copy returns of Magazine 
Management comics? A.  The answer is yes. Moreover, the dissent neglects appellant's express concession (Brief at 19) that the ""undisputed testimony adduced at trial 
established that . . . [the] contract was treated and understood by the parties thereto to encompass Magazine Management's off-
sale full-copy return Atlas comic books as well as its current cover comic books. . . ."" "
1091,7," Q.  Now, you had a verbal agreement with Mr. Waldman with respect to the sale of some part of your full cover returns. Is that 
correct? Mr. Carpency: Mr. I. Waldman. A.  I don't understand the question. I pointed out before that I. Waldman was doing business with Magazine Management many 
years before I arrived at that position. Number two, the verbal agreement we had with him was that the comics were being channeled into premium accounts. Q.  Did you ever authorize Mr. I. Waldman to sell your full-copy returns for resale to the general public? A.  No. Q.  Do you know 
why such authority was not given to Mr. Waldman? A.  For the simple reason we would run into all kinds of problems with our distributor, a national distributor and wholesalers, and 
just like everybody else it is just not done in our trade. Q.  It was in your best interests not to conflict the profitability of your current line, is that correct? A.  That is correct. "
1092,8," The dissent questions the clarity of the court's Schwinn charge in light of the complexity of the facts adduced at trial. We do not 
agree. The court charged: If on the other hand you find that there was a sale, that Magazine Management sold to Independent and Independent 
resold the magazine, then you have the question of whether there was an agreement between Independent and Magazine 
Management under the terms of which Magazine Management, for the benefit of Independent, would restrict the resale of 
these magazines. You see, what the plaintiff is suggesting to you, to sort of turn the facts of Schwinn around and consider the flow back of the 
magazines after they have gone down the chain of distribution, gone down to the retailer, and started back up, and their 
argument is this: at the time they get to Independent, Independent is really the owner of the magazines, and it, in effect, by 
returning them to Magazine Management and getting a credit from Magazine Management is selling them back to 
Magazine Management, and if that is what it is doing, if it is conditioning its sale to Magazine Management on an 
agreement that Magazine Management will not resell except for premiums, so forth and so on, then that agreement is a 
violation of the Sherman Act, section one, as in the Schwinn case.  (App. 532a-33a). These instructions made it clear to the jury that they must find not only a sale from Independent to Magazine, but also an 
agreement to restrict the resale of these comics. United States v. Arnold Schwinn & Co., supra, 388 U.S. at 382."
1092,9,"  Now the second theory of recovery that has been advanced to you by the plaintiff, is a conspiracy theory, and a conspiracy 
is basically an agreement between two or more persons. You have to have at least two persons to have a conspiracy, to do 
either an unlawful act or to do an act which in and of itself is lawful, but which accomplishes an unlawful result, and the 
theory here is the latter, that even though there is no question that Magazine Management independently has the right to 
sell or not to sell to whomever it wants to, if in combination with Independent News it determined not to sell to Waldman for 
the purpose of preventing Williams from competing with Independent News, then that is a combination or conspiracy which 
violates the antitrust laws. Now, on this issue you have some credibility questions that you have got to resolve, and basically the question, I think, gets 
down to, well, why did Magazine Management stop selling to Waldman? And there are two theories advanced to you on 
that issue, and they are as follows: The plaintiff's theory is that Magazine Management was getting rid of a lot of these off-
sale copies through Waldman, and Waldman in turn was selling them to Williams, and that Magazine Management was 
perfectly content to have Waldman sell Williams, who in turn resold in the domestic market until the retailers and "
1093,," wholesalers of Independent News started to complain to Independent News, and then according to the plaintiff's theory 
Independent News brought these complaints to the attention of Magazine Management and coerced Magazine 
Management into cutting Waldman off, not because of any reasons, good business reasons of Magazine Management, but 
because they yielded to the pressure of Independent News to prevent Williams from competing with the wholesalers and 
retailers of Independent News. That, I think, basically is the theory of the plaintiff; that Magazine Management really didn't 
care about what happened in the after-market after they sold them to Waldman until they were pressured by Independent, 
which was complaining about the pressure it was getting from its wholesalers and retailers, and therefore yielding to that 
pressure they cut off Waldman for the purpose of injuring Williams and driving him out of competition, and if you accept that 
version of the facts, if you think that that is the proper version of the facts, then you can find from this evidence that there 
was a combination or conspiracy which was a violation of the antitrust laws, and then you would have to determine to what 
extent, if any, did that combination or conspiracy resulting in Williams being cut off, cause him economic injury. The dissent concludes at 1110 that the combination element of § 1 of the Sherman Act should have been more meaningfully 
developed by the court in its charge to the jury, suggesting that if Independent brought pressure to bear on Magazine, the jury 
might find such pressure to be a combination to restrain trade. Since testimony was introduced relating to Independent's 
pressure, the dissent concludes that the jury should have been instructed to determine whether there existed a combination 
between Independent and Magazine. A fair reading of the court's charge discloses that this was exactly what the jury was 
instructed to determine."

1094,3, Premiums are defined at footnote 3 of the majority opinion.
1094,4," The majority discusses, at some length, the rules to be employed in considering the legality of exclusive dealing contracts. See 
text following note 5 of majority opinion. Justice Fortas, in Schwinn, stated: ""At the other extreme, a manufacturer of a product 
other and equivalent brands of which are readily available in the market may select his customers, and for this purpose he may 
'franchise' certain dealers to whom, alone, he will sell his goods . . . If the restraint stops at that point -- if nothing more is 
involved than vertical 'confinement' of the manufacturer's own sales of the merchandise to selected dealers, and if competitive 
products are readily available to others, the restriction, on these facts alone, would not violate the Sherman Act."" (388 U.S. at 
376). (Emphasis added.) "
1095,5," See appendix for schematic representation illustrating the distribution or sale of new comics and the return and sale of off-sale 
comic books."
1095,6," The district court may have had in mind the statement in Schwinn that if there is an agency relationship, the transfer from the 
manufacturer to its distributor might be accompanied by a restriction without creating a per se violation. 388 U.S. at 371. However, there was no evidence that the arrangements vis-a-vis Magazine and Waldman amounted to an agency, consignment, 
or franchise."

1096,12," 15 U.S.C. § 1. That section provides that: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade . . . is declared to be illegal. . . ."" A practice deemed to be per se illegal is one in which the Court finds that its anti-competitive effects are such as to preclude the 
possibility of legally cognizable business justifications. As Justice White put it in Schwinn (388 U.S. at 379): ""Such restraints are 
so obviously destructive of competition that their mere existence is enough."""
1096,13, 388 U.S. at 380.
1096,14, Id. at 382.
1096,15," Analyzed in this way, Independent assumes the position of Schwinn and Magazine, the role of the distributors and retailers. In 
other words, at this stage in the distribution chain of off-sale books, Independent is a ""seller"" and Magazine its ""purchaser."" "
1097,16," Although this approach is not suggested by the plaintiffs, it, too, seems to be mandated by an application of the principles in 
Schwinn to the facts of this case. As Justice Fortas stated: ""Under the Sherman Act, it is unreasonable without more for a manufacturer to seek to restrict and 
confine areas or persons with whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has parted with dominion over it. . . . Such 
restraints are so obviously destructive of competition that their mere existence is enough. If the manufacturer parts with 
dominion over his product or transfers risk of loss to another, he may not reserve control over its destiny or the conditions of its 
resale. . . . On the other hand . . . we are not prepared to introduce the inflexibility which a per se rule might bring if it were 
applied to prohibit all vertical restrictions of territory and all franchising, in the sense of designating specified distributors and 
retailers as the chosen instruments through which the manufacturer, retaining ownership of the goods, will distribute them to the 
public. . . . ""This does not, of course, excuse or condone the per se violations which, in substance, consist of the control over the resale of 
Schwinn's products after Schwinn has parted with ownership thereof. Once the manufacturer has parted with title and risk, he 
has parted with dominion over the product, and his effort thereafter to restrict territory or persons to whom the product may be 
transferred -- whether by explicit agreement or by silent combination or understanding with his vendee -- is a per se violation of § 
1 of the Sherman Act."" 388 U.S. at 379-80, 382."

1098,21," As the majority points out, the fault was not entirely that of the trial judge, since through some misunderstanding the requests 
for charge had been submitted in narrative form. However, after the charge, plaintiff sought a clarification regarding the use by 
the court of the rule of reason in connection with the transfer by Independent to Magazine of the off-sale comics on the ground 
that if such transfer were accompanied by a restriction, a per se violation may well have occurred. (N.T. 506) The trial court did 
not clarify this point, but instead repeated the use of the rule of reason in connection with the restriction allegedly imposed on 
Magazine so far as the resale of the off-sale comics was concerned. (N.T. 511)."

quoting United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. at 375. In Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (3d Cir. 1970) (en banc) this Court held that the rule of Schwinn did not invalidate 
certain resale restrictions imposed by a manufacturer upon a wholesale distributor, even though there had been a completed 
sale by the former to the latter. However, the manufacturer alleged, as justification for the restrictions, that they served to protect 
the public against physical injury, and to protect the manufacturer against potential product liability. Tripoli is thus readily 
distinguishable from this case, since no such justifications were proffered here."

the freedom of distributors to dispose of the Schwinn products, which they have bought from Schwinn, where and to whomever 
they choose."" 388 U.S. at 378. Issues of collateral estoppel and compulsory counterclaim have been raised on this appeal. The majority, deciding the case on 
the merits, does not address these procedural questions. Although the problems presented are not without some merit, in view 
of the fact that this is a minority opinion, further discussion of these issues would not appear fruitful. "
1109,*," Paul Benson, Chief District Judge, District of North Dakota, sitting by designation. "
1110,1," The determination of damages was held in abeyance pending appeal. In addition, the court determined that the action was not 
properly maintained as a class suit. See Worthen Bank & Trust Co. v. National BankAmericard Inc., 345 F. Supp. 1323 (E.D. 
Ark. 1972)."
1110,2," After oral argument of this case it became apparent that any decision in this case would affect the bank credit card industry 
generally. Since the importance of the bank credit card industry to the general public was undisputed, the Court, on its own 
motion, invited the United States to submit a brief as amicus curiae. See F.R.A.P. 29. The Department of Justice has filed a brief 
urging reversal."
1110,3," According to the President of NBI: ""Class B banks act as agents for Class A banks and solicit and sign contracts with merchants for their sponsoring Class A 
banks, but do not issue cards or own cardholder accounts. They purchase sales drafts from merchants and forward them to 
their sponsoring Class A banks for processing, but do not otherwise participate in the interchange of such drafts. . . . The 
agent bank status permits smaller banks to offer credit card services to merchant customers, accepting their sales drafts 
but not carrying their outstanding credit, since they are reimbursed by their respective sponsoring Class A banks. . . ."" App.

1112,4," NBI bylaws 2.15 also provides: ""Section 2.15 Confidentiality. No member shall publish, disclose, convey or distribute to any person or organization,

including, but not limited to, documents, ideas, products and data, without the prior written consent of the corporation,

program and to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to properly perform such services, (ii) does not compete with "
1113,," the corporation or its members with respect to the BankAmericard program, and (iii) agrees to hold such matters in 
confidence; and (b) such matters that have been publicly released by the corporation."""
1113,5," Bylaw 2.16 also has an impact on local or regional bank credit card programs. Dual participation is apparently prohibited with 
respect to both A and B banks in NBI and any bank card program owned and operated by more than one bank. "

] Per se violations include those ""'agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and 
lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to 
the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.'"" Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L.

1116,7," As Chief Justice Burger noted in his dissent, United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, 405 U.S. at 614, the Topco 
arrangement provided its members with certain economies which they could not otherwise achieve except by association. But 
we agree with the Justice Department that ""The 'product' represented by a national credit card requires cooperative relationships "
1117,," among the member banks of a kind not encountered in the sale of products by individual supermarket chains."" Indeed in this 
case association is required before the ""product"" can exist. "
1118,8," It should be noted that the determination of whether there is competition between NBI and MC does not depend upon actual 
revenue competition between them. Competition may be shown by proving an overall increase in the profit making ability of their 
members."
1118,9," Of special significance in this respect would be evidence as to how the development of these new technological procedures 
would permit better and cheaper service to the card holders and the merchants or otherwise enhance competition between the 
systems and their member banks."
1118,10," The question is whether the means used by NBI to protect its productive capacity goes further than necessary in restricting the 
free choice of its members. Cf. Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 361-366, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 
(1963); Note, Concerted Refusals to Deal Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 1537."
1118,11," It is incumbent upon plaintiff to prove the effect of the rule on interbank competition, and especially the effect on interest rates 
on deferred payments charged the cardholder, the discount rates charged the merchants and spill over business. If plaintiff 
proves that the bylaw restrains interbank competition then NBI must prove that competition does exist between the systems and 
the effect of the bylaw thereon with emphasis on the possible reduction of incentive in advancing technological innovations, on 
resulting interest costs to the cardholders and discount rates to the merchants. NBI must also submit proof as to the necessity of 
maintaining the bylaw in its present form rather than a more limited version thereof. "

1127,1," Defendant contends that: ""No case has ever suggested that general restrictions upon the dealer's 'independence' fall within the 
purview of the antitrust laws."" In the recent Supreme Court case of U.S. v. Arnold Schwinn & Co. , (388 U.S. (1967) ) doubt was 
cast upon this contention.  The Court noted: ""If the manufacturer parts with dominion over his product or transfers risk of loss to 
another, he may not reserve control over its destiny or the conditions of its resale."" 388 U.S. at 379. However, we need not rule 
on the antitrust implications of such ""general restrictions"".  In the present case we find sufficient factual dispute with reference to 
price and TBA policy. "

in dealing with a demurrer to a complaint alleging restraint of trade by an insurance company, stated that HN4[

Act which encompasses the general antitrust law of California is ""expressly superseded and contravened by the specific 
provisions of the Insurance Code."" (69 Cal.2d at p. 322.) After making that statement, the court recognized legal prohibitions 
against trade restraint by insurers when it analyzed the complaint in painstaking detail to determine whether the pleading alleged 
a cause of action in restraint of trade. While the opinion in Chicago Title Ins. does not cite section 790.03, subdivision (c), that 
provision is the only one other than the Cartwright Act imposing such a prohibition upon insurance companies."

respecting the sixth."
1161,11," The facts we have recited, for the most part, were alleged in appellant's complaint. A few were established by an 
uncontradicted affidavit submitted on behalf of appellees, which the District Court was at liberty to consider. The motion to 
dismiss was treatable as a motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); see also 2A J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 
12.09 (2d ed. 1948); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice § 1364 at 664-73 (1969); and the absence of any issue of material 
fact was evident. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157-60, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142, 90 S. Ct. 1598 (1970); 
Bloomgarden v. Coyer, 156 U.S. App. D.C. 109, 479 F.2d 201, 206-07 (1973)."
1161,12," Prior to filing suit in the District Court, appellant sought to intervene in a proceeding pending before Transit's regulatory 
agency, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, upon Transit's application for an increase in certain of its fares. 
At the time, appellant informed the Commission that he desired to test the validity of the conveyances by the requirements of § 
10. The Commission denied intervention but instructed its staff to investigate the matter, and the staff later reported that it found 
no evidence of § 10 violations to lay before the Commission. See D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.  (Order No. 1090), 85 P.U.R.3d 508, 
509-10 (WMATC 1970). After the Commission granted Transit a fare increase, D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 1052), 85 
P.U.R.3d 1 (WMATC 1970), rev'd, Democratic Cent. Comm. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, supra note 8, 
485 F.2d 886, appellant sought reconsideration but apparently did not renew the antitrust objection. The Commission denied 
reconsideration, D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 1090), supra, and appellant filed a petition for review in this court, but on "
1162,," appellant's motion it was later dismissed with prejudice. The disposition we make eliminates any occasion to investigate the 
possible effect of those events upon appellant's suit."
1162,13," The suit was instituted prior to the termination of Transit's franchise by public acquisition and consequent cessation of its 
transportation operations. See National Capital Area Transit Act of 1972, § 102(b), 86 Stat. 1001 (1972). Neither in its character 
as a suit against Transit nor as one against its officers and conveyee-subsidiaries was it impaired by the takeover. See id. § 
102(d), 86 Stat. 1001 (1972); Democratic Cent. Comm. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, supra note 8, slip op. 
at 86-89."
1162,14," The defendants named are Transit, its parent corporation, the six subsidiaries, and directors and officers of those 
corporations."
1162,15," See note 3, supra.  Appellant advises us that he does not seek payment of damages to farepayers individually, which 
obviously is an impossibility. Instead, he would have any amount recovered in his lawsuit held and dispensed pursuant to court 
order for the benefit of users of the transit system. Compare, e.g., Bebchick v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 232-
33, 318 F.2d 187, 203-04, cert. denied, 373 U.S. 913, 10 L. Ed. 2d 414, 83 S. Ct. 1304 (1963). See also Democratic Cent. 
Comm. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, supra note 8, slip op. at 75-89."
1162,16," See note 11, supra."
1162,17," Appellees also mount a strenuous attack on appellant's standing to sue. The jurisdictional predicate of the suit is § 4 of the 
Clayton Act, which authorizes an action for treble damages by a ""person . . . injured in his business or property by reason of 
[conduct] forbidden in the antitrust laws."" See note 3, supra.  This language makes evident three basic requirements which 
appellant had to satisfy in order to achieve standing to maintain the action. HN5[
] The first was sufficient allegation of injury to ""business or property,"" and those words ""refer to commercial interests or 
enterprises."" Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972). One who in a business 
transaction purchases an article is ""injured in [his] property"" when he is ""led to pay more than the worth of the"" article, 
Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 396, 51 L. Ed. 241, 27 S. Ct. 65 (1906); ""[a] person whose 
property is diminished by a payment of money wrongfully induced is injured in his property."" Id. Accord, Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. 
United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 489-90, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). We have no doubt that a consumer 
of service who is illegally overcharged sustains a property injury no less than a consumer of goods. See Hawaii v. Standard Oil 
Co., supra, 405 U.S. at 262-64; Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U.S. 66, 88, 61 L. Ed. 597, 37 S. Ct. 353 (1917). Appellant's complaint 
claims injury to Transit's riders as consumers in the marketplace of local transportation service. Appellant, however, faced also additional requirements of § 4 -- injury in consequence of a violation of the antitrust laws. See 
Karseal Corp. v. Richfield Oil Corp., 221 F.2d 358, 362 (9th Cir. 1955), and cases there cited. Section 10 is an antitrust law 
within the meaning of § 4, Clayton Act § 1, 15 U.S.C. § 12 (1970), but the more critical inquiries here are whether the activities 
asserted in appellant's complaint could have injured Transit's customers, and whether those activities would, if proven, fall within 
the scope and purpose of § 10. Thus HN6[
] standing to sue depends in part upon whether the case alleged in the complaint 
sufficed to charge an infringement of § 10. "

to create a monopoly."" The complaint was filed and these proceedings were instituted under § 15 of the Clayton Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 25.

California. "

compared with California's $2.6 billion.  Texas ranked second in gasoline consumption in 1970 (the latest year available), with 
6.0 billion gallons as compared with California's 9.1 billion gallons.  Similarly, second-ranking New York had 6.7 million motor 
vehicle registrations in 1970 while California had 11.9 million. "
1180,4," Throughout this opinion, the terms ""unilateral entry,"" ""independent entry,"" or ""de novo entry"" will denote entry into a market 
through the entering firm's own efforts without a purchase or acquisition of stock or assets of a firm already in the market other 
than of a de minimis nature. "
1181,5," Seven Justices participated in the decision in Falstaff. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice 
Burger and Justice Blackmun joined, and in Part I of which Justice Douglas joined.  Thus, references to Part I of the Court's 
opinion may properly be considered references to the ""majority"" opinion.  Justice Douglas filed an opinion concurring in part, and 
Justice Marshall's opinion concurred in the result.  Justice Rehnquist filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stewart joined. "
1184,6," Justice Marshall agreed with this view, in addition to Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, and Douglas."
1184,7," The Court also implied that it was not adopting the district court's technically undisturbed finding, made on the basis of 
subjective evidence of management intent, that Falstaff was not a potential unilateral entrant. The language in note 13 implies 
that the likelihood of future market entry is to be determined primarily on the basis of objective evidence, at least where this 
aspect of potential competition is accompanied by likely on-the-fringe influence on existing competition. "
1190,8," Another factor motivating Phillips to enter the California market was the trend in the 1950's and 1960's among other leading oil 
firms to expand their marketing activities geographically.  For example, Atlantic Refining Company's marketing area expanded 
from 17 states in 1956 to 46 in 1970, while Gulf's expanded from 39 in 1961 to 48 in 1970.  Phillips' marketing activities grew 
from 35 states in 1956 to 50 states when it established a service station at Anchorage, Alaska, following its acquisition of 
Tidewater.  The primary purpose of Phillips' expansion into Alaska was to be able to advertise that it marketed in all 50 states. "
1195,9," In 1970, Gulf acquired a 20,000-30,000 B/D refinery at Hercules, California from Sequoia Refining Company.  In the same 
year, Signal Oil & Gas Company sold its modernized 24,500 B/D refinery at Bakersfield to Toscopertro Corporation.  Both 
refineries manufactured high-quality motor gasoline. "
1202,10," Mergers were justified on failing company grounds in United States v. Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Ass'n, supra, and in 
International Shoe Co. v. FTC, supra. Failing company defenses were rejected in the following cases, among others: United 
States v. Greater Buffalo Press, 402 U.S. 549, 91 S. Ct. 1692, 29 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1971); Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States,

to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or 
resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers or either of them. . . . ."""
1215,2," 38 Stat. 730, as amended, 49 Stat. 1526, 1527, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13,(d), 13(e), provide in full as follows: (d) ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or 
for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any 
services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for 
sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or 
consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products 
or commodities. (e) ""It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of 
a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the 
furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity 
so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."" "
1218,3," In Interrogatory 35, Kirby was asked without specification of context if he had constructed or caused to be constructed for his 
customers' use, racks comparable to those furnished to Hook. He replied in the affirmative, without stating whether those racks 
were intended to hold Eveready or Mallory batteries. Because of our conclusion supporting the finding of the trial court that 
Mallory did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act with respect to the furnishing of display racks, we need not reach the question 
of whether Kirby's expenses for the construction of these racks were causally related to any action taken by Mallory. "
1232,1," In Thill Securities Corp. v. New York Stock Exchange, 57 F.R.D. 133 (E.D.Wisc. 1973), the post-trial brief of the United States,

intended to outlaw fixed minimum commissions in passing the 1934 Act. "" (Post-trial brief at pp. 8-9). "
1243,1," Note, however, that in McMackin the Court recognizes that the proven tie in must be demonstrated to be ""burdensome"", i.e., 
that it has in some sense injured the plaintiff in his business or property.  354 F. Supp. at 1156. "

1968), cert. denied 391 U.S. 914, 88 S. Ct. 1807, 20 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1968), in which plaintiff was denied preliminary injunctive 
relief in part because the plaintiffs had failed to show the connection between their declining sales and the allegedly illegal tie-in 
in that case.  See also B & W Gas, Inc. v. General Gas Corp., 247 F. Supp. 339, 343 (N.D. Ga. 1965). "
1264,1," Pursuant to Rule 41(a) (1) (ii), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties stipulated on April 11, 1973, to a dismissal of Count 
II of the complaint on the grounds that it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  In Count I, plaintiff had sought 
damages on the theory of breach of contract. "
1265,2," Thus plaintiff commenced this action within a few days of the running of the 4-year statute of limitations contained in Section 4B 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15b. The injury arising from the cancellation of the order allegedly occurred on or about June 12, 
1967. "
1266,3," ""ITT requested only equitable relief, including a request that GTE be ordered to divest itself of its interests in Peninsular 
Telephone Company (Peninsular), the Western Utilities Group, Central Iowa, Hawaiian and Northern Ohio, as well as its 
manufacturing subsidiaries AE, Lenkurt and Sylvania, to the end that the independent telephone operating companies market for 
telecommunications equipment (i.e., excluding the American Telephone and Telegraph System (Bell) would be opened to 
competition among all the independent telecommunications equipment manufacturing companies. As indicated, in essence ITT purported to act in the status of a 'private attorney general ' in this action against GTE.  ITT asked 
for no money damages under its federal claims.  It did ask for costs and attorneys' fees for its claims under the Hawaiian Act."" 
(351 F. Supp. at 1161-2)."
1266,4," In Towle v. Boeing Airplane Company, infra, 364 F.2d 590, 592 (8th Cir. 1966), Judge Van Oosterhout succinctly summarized 
the law as follows: The term res judicata is frequently used to cover merger, bar, collateral estoppel and direct estoppel.  See Lawlor v. 
National Screen Service, 349 U.S. 322, 326, n.6, 75 S. Ct. 865, 99 L. Ed. 1122. Here, as in Engelhardt v. Bell & Howell Co., 
8 Cir., 327 F.2d 30, we adopt Professor Vestal's more precise and helpful descriptive words of claim preclusion and issue 
preclusion, which he defines thusly: ""The concept of res judicata, which is not at all a simple one, encompasses at least two distinct facets.  For the sake of 
clarity it is desirable to distinguish the foreclosing of further litigation on a cause of action (which may be called claim 
preclusion) from the preclusion of further litigation of an issue (which may properly be called issue preclusion)."" Vestal, 
Preclusion/Res Judicata Variables, April 1965 issue Washington University Law Quarterly, p. 158. . . . The law of res judicata/claim preclusion is well established. Whenever a court having jurisdiction has rendered a final 
judgment upon the merits of a cause of action, that judgment is binding upon the parties and their privies not only as to 
every matter that was litigated but also to every matter which could have been litigated. In event of subsequent litigation 
upon the same cause of action, the parties and their privies are precluded from receiving relief.  (Citations omitted). . . . "
1267,," It is well settled that a litigant cannot split his claim and have two trials upon the same alleged breach of duty. Baltimore 
S.S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 320, 47 S. Ct. 600, 71 L. Ed. 1069; Engelhardt v. Bell & Howell Co., supra; Norman 
Tobacco & Candy Co. v. Gillette Safety Razor Co., 5 Cir., 295 F.2d 362, 363. "
1268,5," Judge Pence stated at page 923 of 296 F. Supp.: While the right to such injunctive relief to redress antitrust grievances may be said to be ""additional"" to the right to damages in 
the sense that it may be conjoined therewith, it may also be an alternative.  As the above history manifests, the equitable remedy 
of § 16 is in no way ""predicated upon"", incidental to or derived from the legal right of § 4.  The two sections expressly create 
wholly independent remedies, in strikingly similar language.  A litigant may pull either trigger of his shotgun independently, or, at 
his option, he may shoot both barrels together.  This is abundantly clear from the instant complaint, in which plaintiff seeks only 
injunctive relief. No damage claim exists herein on which any equitable remedy could be predicated. Yet defendants have not 
challenged plaintiff's right to maintain this suit.  (Emphasis added). "
1269,6," See Anno.: ""Injunction -- Bar -- Action for Damages,"" 26 A.L.R. 2d 446 (1952), and Anno.: ""Specific Performance as Bar to 
Damages,"" 38 A.L.R. 3d 323 (1971). "
1272,7," The lone exception, if in fact it may be termed an exception, is that a state can sue on behalf of her citizens as parens patriae 
under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. It may not, however, sue in that capacity in order to secure damages under Section 4 of the 
Clayton Act. Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., infra, 405 U.S. 251, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972). "
1277,1," The project was originally scheduled to be completed on November 1, 1967. "
1279,2, Defendants do not concede violation of the antitrust laws nor do they concede causation or damages. 
1281,3," In Siegfried v. Kansas City Star Co., 298 F.2d 1 (8th Cir. 1962), the court dealt with the word ""speculative"" but in a different 
context than here.  Although the court did indicate that damages may still be speculative even when there is enough evidence to 
allow the issue to go to a jury, the case did not deal with a statute of limitations problem.  Moreover, all the court really held by 
using the word ""speculative"" in the manner it did is that although there is enough evidence to go to a jury, the jury need not 
believe the evidence and may still find that plaintiff suffered no damage. "
1282,4," The evidence may even be estimates based upon assumptions as long as the assumptions rest upon an adequate base.  
Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United States Shoe Machinery Corp., 297 F.2d 906 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 865, 82 S. Ct. 
1031, 8 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1962). The proof need not be direct but may be circumstantial.  Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., 260 U.S. 
156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183 (1922). To allow the fact finder appropriate discretion in the matter of the extent of damages, the 
Supreme Court has indicated that the clearly erroneous standard is appropriate on appeal.  United States v. United States 
Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S. Ct. 525, 92 L. Ed. 746 (1948)."
1282,5," By letter on September 1, 1966 MAI advised Monona Shores that the latter was in default on the mortgage. (Memorandum 
opinion of Judge Sachtjen, Dane County Circuit Court, November 26, 1968 at p. 9).  Surely this letter was proper evidence of 
damage at that early time.  And the Wisconsin Supreme Court stated that Monona Shores ""had knowledge as early as 
September, 1965, that its original financing was not sufficient."" 177 N.W. 2d at 347. It seems reasonable that given this state of 
affairs plaintiffs could have garnered proof of damage before September, 1967. "
1288,1," This court has never heard of a boycott case where some predatory purpose or intended exclusionary effect was not involved.  
Else we might still be chained to the outmoded mousetrap, the pony express and the horse and buggy."
1288,2," Plaintiff's president conceded in this case that plaintiff's single disease policy ""is not the same product"" as that sold by 
defendants and, in the Florida case, infra, that ""we sell only a partial product."""
1288,3," Also at stake here is the right of the public to buy a policy with or without COB, as it chooses. "
1289,4," The court intends this dismissal to be with prejudice; however, should certiorari be granted by the Supreme Court in the Florida 
Blue Cross case, we suggest that counsel move the Fifth Circuit to withhold any opinion in this case until that case is disposed 
of.  In this way, additional appeals of the same question may be avoided. "
1292,1," On April 22, 1969 Schnapps Shop, Inc. filed private antitrust suits in this Court against Bond Distributing Co. (Bond), a 
Maryland corporation, and H. W. Wright & Co., Ltd.  Then on February 25, 1970, Schnapps sued Universal Liquors, Inc.  
Although each suit alleged a separate antitrust violation, and no allegations were made of any conspiracy among the three 
defendants, the cases, because they involved similar questions of law and substantially similar ultimate factual questions (see 
Federal Civil Rule 42(a)), were pretried jointly and calendared for successive non-jury trials as to issues of liability only.  The 
damage issues were bifurcated and reserved for later trial under Federal Civil Rule 42(b). Just before trial the Bond case was "
1293,," settled.  By agreement of counsel in the Wright and Universal cases, evidence in those two cases was considered evidence in 
each."
1293,2, 15 U.S.C. § 1.
1293,3, 15 U.S.C. § 15.
1293,4," Schnapps and Wright, however, resumed business dealings with one another in December, 1972, and have since continued to 
transact business.  Schnapps and Universal have done no business with each other since the alleged cut-off date. "
1294,5," The Supreme Court's discussion in Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 229-235, 68 S. Ct. 
996, 92 L. Ed. 1328 (1948), raises the question of whether the scope of the interstate commerce element of the Sherman Act is 
fully as broad as the interstate power of Congress as outlined in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S. Ct. 82, 87 L. Ed. 122 
(1942). Thus, only the most local of transactions have been held outside the Sherman Act's reach. See, e.g., Northern California 
Monument Dealers Ass'n v. Interment Ass'n of California, 120 F. Supp. 93 (D.Cal.1954) (alleged Sherman § 1 and Clayton § 2 
violations in the retail sales of gravestones not within interstate commerce clause).  But cf. Norfolk Monument Co. v. Woodlawn 
Memorial Gardens, Inc., 394 U.S. 700, 89 S. Ct. 1391, 22 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1969) (reversing district court per curiam and specifying 
actions form which conspiracy could be inferred in a fact situation facially similar to that in Monument Dealers, supra, but not 
commenting upon the interstate commerce point); Monument Bowl, Inc. v. Northern California Bowling Proprietors' Ass'n, 197 F. 
Supp. 208 (N.D.Cal.1961) (charge that operator of bowling establishment lost customers as a result of defendants' conduct not 
illegal restraint of trade, but at most local restraint affecting local commerce).  Tobman v. Cottage Woodcraft Shop, 194 F. Supp. 
83 (S.D.Cal.1961), relied upon by defendants in the within case, holds (at 88): ""The fact that articles which are the subject of 
price-fixing agreements have previously moved in interstate commerce, does not by itself establish the requisite adverse effect 
upon interstate commerce""; and also holds that further facts must be shown.  Even if that is the test, but see Burke v. Ford, 
supra, there exist in this case ""further facts"".  See the discussion in the body of this opinion, infra."
1294,6," In his deposition, Wareheim stated: Q * * * You only reacted to complaints of advertised prices from other retailers? A That's right. "
1295,," Although Wareheim (of Wright) testified at trial that he made the calls to offending retailers regardless of phone calls from other 
retailers, this Court finds that Wareheim's initial statement is the correct one. "
1296,7, See the indented quotation at p. 576 supra. 
1297,8," Douglas testified at trial that Moffett, Wright's sales manager, also visited Schnapps to complain about the advertisement. 
Douglas was unsure of the date, and unforthcoming about the nature of the visit, except to state that Moffett, like Wareheim, 
informed him he could not run such advertisements. Defendants did not call Moffett to the stand, and in light of this Court's 
findings concerning the Wareheim visit, it is unnecessary to make any findings concerning the alleged Moffett visit. "
1299,9," Counsel for Wright and Universal have each raised a variety of defenses, all applicable to each case irrespective of which 
defendant raised them.  In this Court's opinion, for the reasons set forth infra in the body of this opinion, none of those defenses 
are meritorious as to Wright or Universal.  Thus, they are of no help to Wright, and would be of no help to Universal if Schnapps 
had proven a conspiracy in the Universal case. "
1301,10," At trial, there was considerable exploration of factual issues concerning plaintiff's alleged sales below cost.  In Wright, 
defendant showed that Schnapps purchased quarts of Hiram Walker's Imperial Whiskey from defendant at $4.05 per bottle, or 
$8.10 for two quarts, and half-gallon bottles at $7.49.  Thus, to the extent Schnapps sold two quart bottles rather than half-
gallons at the advertised price of $7.99, it was selling below the price it paid for the liquor. In Universal, defendant showed that 
plaintiff had paid $3.05 per fifth of Charter Oak bourbon, which Schnapps then advertised at $2.99 per fifth.  Douglas claims that 
Universal gives one free case of liquor with every twenty-five ordered, and that Feldman personally delivered to him one free 
case and then calculated on the back of an invoice Douglas' resulting cost at $2.83.  Feldman, however, testified that he has, 
and had then, four disintegrated discs, and has not lifted a case of anything for years.  Feldman further testified that the 
handwriting on the back of the invoice was not his own.  The Court accepts Feldman's testimony and accordingly does not find 
that Universal delivered a free case of Charter Oak bourbon to defendant. "
1302,11," The contention that the Maryland Unfair Sales Act is within the Sherman Act exemption for Fair Trade laws lacks merit since 
even if the Maryland Act did fall within that exemption it does not authorize defendant's conspiracy. HN8[
] The Unfair Sales 
Act directs individual retailer compliance, and places no statutory duty or right upon either a distributor or a competing retailer to 
use self-help to police an offending retailer. It should be noted that Wareheim also testified that Hiram Walker's Imperial Whiskey had been under a Fair Trade agreement 
for sixteen years pursuant to Maryland's Fair Trade Act, Md.Ann.Code Art. 83, §§ 102-110.  Wareheim admitted, however, that 
the Fair Trade agreement had not been enforced during, and for some time prior to, the events in question. He also specifically 
disavowed any intention to enforce the Fair Trade agreement against Schnapps at the September 14, 1968 meeting.  No 
questions arise, therefore, with respect to the possibility that Wright's actions, had they been pursuant to a Fair Trade 
agreement, would have been exempt from Sherman Act purview. "
1306,1," The plaintiffs-appellants are Karlene H. Cobb and Walter J. Cobb and Family Cinemas, Inc., a Georgia Corporation; Chester A. 
Strycula and Robert R. Bigelow, d/b/a Gaill Enterprises, Inc.; Michael Solomon and Solomon Cinemas, Inc., a Georgia 
Corporation. "
1307,2," HN1[
] 9 U.S.C. § 3 provides: If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under 
an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue 
involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the 
parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 
providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration. "
1309,3," The plaintiffs in this case labelled the relief they sought a ""temporary injunction"" of the arbitration proceedings, rather than a 
""stay of arbitration""; and in its opinion, the district court spoke of denying the ""temporary injunction"", rather than denying a ""stay"".  
The difference of terminology is of no consequence, however.  The authorities cited in the text and in note 4 infra typically refer 
to an action like the district court's here as a denial of a stay of arbitration, and so we refer to the court's order here as a denial of 
a stay, rather than of a temporary injunction. In any event, the question of jurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1) does not of course turn 
on differences in terminology."
