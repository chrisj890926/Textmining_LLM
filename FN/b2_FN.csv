32,1," The plaintiffs have alleged a number of violations under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In bringing this motion, however, 
the plaintiffs have elected to proceed solely on their monopoly leveraging claim, which they refer to as a cause of action for 
monopolization under section 2. Thus the court does not now consider or express any opinion on the plaintiffs' claims under 
section 1 of the Sherman Act, nor their attempted monopolization claim under section 2. Nor has the court yet been presented 
with the plaintiffs' more usual section 2 monopolization claim, i.e., the allegation that defendant has ""monopolized"" the ""markets"" 
for ""electrical distribution systems"" and ""street and outdoor lighting systems."" Finally, the court has elected to bifurcate its 
consideration of the plaintiffs' motion itself.  The court has reserved consideration of the plaintiffs' request for summary judgment 
on defendant's affirmative defenses until it determines whether the plaintiffs are entitled to summary adjudication regarding the 
""prima facie"" elements of their monopoly leveraging theory.  In summary, this memorandum is concerned only with whether the 
plaintiffs would be entitled to judgment on the theory set forth in Berkey Photo, assuming arguendo that the defenses cannot 
stand.  Finally, while it is of course part of any prima facie case to demonstrate that the court has jurisdiction over the subject 
matter of the action, the question of whether the jurisdictional prerequisites of the Sherman Act are met in this case is raised by 
defendant's third and fourth defenses.  Thus consideration of that question will be deferred pending further argument. "
33,2," The plaintiffs have styled their motion as one for summary judgment, ""or in the alternative for partial summary judgment and for 
an order specifying facts without substantial controversy. . . ."" Obviously, it would aid the prompt and expeditious disposition of 
this case if the court could oblige the plaintiffs by reciting a detailed and comprehensive list of material facts that are no longer 
genuinely in dispute.  Unfortunately, none of the parties has dealt with this motion in a manner that would facilitate the court's 
efforts in this regard.  The plaintiffs are attempting to try a very complex case, using a new theory, on a summary basis.  The 
inherent difficulties in doing this are greatly compounded by the highly colored, consistently tendentious manner in which the 
plaintiffs present what they would have the court accept as undisputed facts and established principles of law.  For its part, the 
defendant refuses, almost without exception, to concede even the most obvious points.  In short, the plaintiffs will not admit that 
any issue is genuinely in dispute, and the defendant will not allow that any is undisputed.  The biggest problem caused by the 
plaintiffs' overzealousness and the defendant's obdurate stance is that both sides have buried themselves so deeply in the battle 
that they have done very little to ascertain for themselves or the court what the contours of the legal dispute really are, and 
hence which facts are relevant. Without more definition, the court is reluctant to enter the fray regarding such matters as whether 
the defendant may purchase electricity wholesale from the Bonneville Power Administration, or how many electric power poles 
the defendant installs in a year.  Thus the sort of catalog sought by the plaintiffs is clearly out of the question.  The court will, 
however, attempt to narrow the issues of fact; to that end, the facts stated by the court throughout this memorandum should be 
regarded as established unless the specific matters discussed are identified as mere allegations, or otherwise in dispute."
33,3," The complicated nature of SMUD's status as a public body, and the somewhat obscure statutory framework from which it arose 
are discussed in some detail by my brother Ramirez in his earlier decision in this case.  Grason Elec. Co. v. Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District, 526 F. Supp. 276 (E.D. Cal. 1981) (denying SMUD's motion for judgment on the pleadings; that motion "
34,," was based on the theory that SMUD is immune from antitrust liability under the ""state action"" exemption recognized in Parker v. 
Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943) and its progeny)."
34,4," The establishment of this simple fact presents a splendid example of the phenomenon discussed in n.2, supra. The plaintiffs 
attempt to support their assertion in this regard by citation to the pleadings; the defendant, in its opposition, notes that it denied 
in its answer that it was the exclusive supplier of retail electricity in its service area; the plaintiffs respond to that observation by 
dubbing the fact ""uncontroverted by SMUD."" Thus the plaintiffs simply choose to ignore their own failure of proof, and the 
defendant, with absolutely no attempt at clarification, just leaves hanging a simple but fundamental factual issue rather than 
make the plaintiffs' (and the court's) task one whit easier.  In an answer to one of the plaintiffs' interrogatories, however, the 
defendant explains its denial by pointing out that owners of certain mobile home parks have been permitted by SMUD to 
""submeter"" electricity in order to adjust rental charges for energy consumption.  Plaintiffs' Exhibit 20, Defendant's Answer to 
Plaintiffs' First Set of Interrogatories, Interrogatory No. 5.  It appears that such limited resale of electricity is of little or no 
consequence to the facts relevant to this case."
34,5," The plaintiffs define an electrical distribution system as ""all of the permanent or temporary electrical distribution lines and 
related equipment between the service equipment at the dwelling or other structure and the point of termination of the 
conductors at the source of feed thereof, at or outside of the property line. The property line means the outer property line of the 
property for which new electrical service is required.  In the case of a development or subdivision in which the interior streets . . . 
are to be dedicated, the outer property line of the entire development is the property line. [P] The distribution system ordinarily 
includes, but is not limited to all service entrance conductors, service laterals, service conductors, clusters, pedestals, or other 
junction connectors, secondary conductors, transformers, primary conductors, conduit, ducts, vaults, manholes, pullboxes or 
other subsurface structures, transformer pads, trenching, backfill and compaction."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum filed September 14, 
1981 at 24-25.  Purely for the sake of convenience, I shall refer to the complex of wiring, connections and other hardware 
described by the plaintiffs as the ""EDS."" In doing so, I do not mean to suggest that I am persuaded that the thing described by "
35,," the plaintiffs is in any real sense separable from the entire electrical distribution network maintained by SMUD.  By doing so I 
certainly do not imply that there is in reality a separate market or submarket for electrical distribution systems."
35,6," In 1978, the price charged by SMUD for providing an underground ""EDS"" was $250.00 per ""residential service run"" (to use 
SMUD's terminology).  See SMUD Rule and Regulation 15 (July 6, 1978), included in Exh. 78 to the plaintiffs' memorandum in 
support of their motion for summary judgment."
35,7," In this regard, SMUD points out that for large industrial consumers, it provides electricity at a high voltage to the customer's 
property and permits the industrial customer to construct and maintain facilities to ""step down"" the power to a voltage that meets 
the customer's specific needs.  Similarly, in the case of an apartment house or a shopping center, SMUD does not run the power 
to each individual unit, but rather provides service as far as an on-property transformer; the owner of the property may (and 
indeed must) connect the various structures or units to the transformer.  The significance of SMUD's policies will be discussed 
further below. "
36,8," The defendant has tendered to the court evidence showing that almost 80% of the street lighting which has been installed in its 
service area since 1975 has been under Rate 51, i.e., constructed and maintained by the customer through private electrical 
contractors or otherwise. "
37,9," HN6[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty . . . [of an offense under the Act]."" "
38,10," HN11[
] Section 1 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1) provides, in pertinent part, ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be 
illegal. . . ."""
38,11," HN12[
] ""A tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product only on the condition that the buyer also 
purchase a different or 'tied' product."" Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 540 (9th Cir. 1983); see 
also L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 431 (1977).  Thus under the allegations in this case, the electrical distribution 
systems could be viewed as a product or service ""tied"" by SMUD to the purchase of electrical energy."
38,12," This interpretation is closest to the one advanced by the plaintiffs in support of this motion; the important difference, of course, 
is that the plaintiffs view their theory as a form of monopolization claim rather than some separate form of Section 2 offense.  In 
addition to this interpretation and the alternative explanation of Griffith as an attempt case (see discussion in text, infra), Kintner 
posits two other interpretations of the Court's opinion.  First, he suggests that the Court was saying that the abuse of monopoly 
power to expand that monopoly constitutes the offense of monopolization under Section 2.  Second, he raises the possibility that 
what the Court meant was that the abuse of monopoly power evidenced a conspiracy to monopolize a second market.  II 
Kintner, supra ยง 12.15 at 389. "
39,13," The ""monopoly leveraging"" theory set forth in Berkey Photo apparently had been employed, although not really explained, in a 
few earlier cases.  See P. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 729.4c (1982 Supplement).  The most significant earlier case was probably 
Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. v. Ventron Corp., 567 F.2d 701, 711-12 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 822, 58 L. Ed. 2d 
113, 99 S. Ct. 87 (1978). The court in that case seemed to view proof of ""monopoly leveraging"" as a means of inferring the intent 
(i.e., ""willfulness"") necessary to establish monopolization of the first market.  Id. at 711-12. The significance of this theoretical 
approach is discussed in the text, infra."
39,14," While it is clear from the statutory history that Congress desired the courts to develop a federal ""common law"" in this area, that 
phrase has several meanings, and it is by no means clear which of those meanings applies to the antitrust field.  Simply put, it is 
one thing to conclude that Congress meant to create three substantive offenses under Section 2 of the Sherman Act 
(monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize), but left it to the courts to fill in the necessary 
definitions of the elements of those offenses (e.g., the definition of ""monopoly,"" or of ""attempt"").  It is something quite different to "
40,," suggest that Congress intended to give the courts carte blanche to create new causes of action consonant with the underlying 
policy of the Act, and merely specified the three Section 2 offenses in order to give the courts some idea as to what it had in 
mind when it enacted the legislation.  It is in this light that the question of whether ""monopoly leveraging"" is a ""new"" Section 2 
offense -- as opposed to being some variant on one of the original three offenses -- may be of greatest significance."
40,15," The power of the courts through the ""federal common law,"" to create an entirely new cause of action not in terms authorized 
by statute, where Congress has provided specific remedies, is like many of the problems of ""federal common law,"" ""a very 
complicated question, which yields to no simple answer. . . ."" Wright The law of Federal Court"" 4th Ed. 388.  While clearly this 
issue is not exactly the same as a question of an implied right of recovery for the breach of a federal statute by someone injured 
by the breach, see Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, 453 U.S. 1, 101 S. Ct. 2615, 
69 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1981), nor a question of whether a statute supplants pre-existing ""federal common law,"" see City of Milwaukee 
v. Illinois & Michigan, 451 U.S. 304, 68 L. Ed. 2d 114, 101 S. Ct. 1784 (1981), nor a question of filling a legislative ""intersticial"" 
gap of the kind created when Congress does not supply a statute of limitations, see DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 103 
S. Ct. 2281, 76 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1983), many of the same considerations which inform such decisions would appear to apply.  By 
observing that this issue is different from more traditional ""federal common law"" questions, I do not mean to suggest that the 
federal courts are foreclosed from such activity.  See, e.g., Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 17 L. Ed. 2d 842, 87 S. Ct. 903 (1967) 
(holding money damages available to union members for a violation of the duty of fair representation) or Bivens v. Six Unknown 
Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619, 91 S. Ct. 1999 (1971) (providing a common law remedy of money "
41,," damages for violation of the Fourth Amendment).  Nonetheless, as Justice Harlan demonstrated in his concurring opinion in 
Bivens, such questions are agonizingly difficult.  Again, I do not suggest that Berkey was wrongly decided, I merely note that 
Berkey does not address the issue.  It may be that the Court in M.A.P. Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 691 F.2d 1303 (9th Cir. 1982), 
perceiving this problem's difficulty, sought to avoid it by construing Berkey as a conventional section 2 cause of action without 
specifying which form of section 2 violation was at stake.  If so, as I describe in the text, the circuit avoided one set of theoretical 
problems only to engender a second set. HN17[
]"
41,16," Indeed, one commentator has suggested that, at least on this score, the Berkey Photo opinion is susceptible to the same 
criticisms that Judge Kaufman levels against Learned Hand's decision in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa), 148 
F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945). Antitrust Advisor 80-81 (1982 Cumulative Supplement).  In Judge Kaufman's pretty formulation, the 
Alcoa opinion is ""a litigant's wishing well, into which, it sometimes seems, one may peer and find nearly anything he wishes."" 
Berkey Photo, 603 F.2d at 273."
41,17," The sketchy quality of the Berkey Photo opinion seems to have encouraged the plaintiffs in the case at bar to argue initially 
that their cause of action was actually very simple.  In fact, the plaintiffs asserted that little more need be established than that 
SMUD had monopoly power, that the plaintiffs sought to do some work that SMUD was doing, and that SMUD prevented them 
from doing that work.  Such a theory proves too much; it is consistent neither with Berkey Photo nor with the body of antitrust 
law as a whole to say that the holder of lawful monopoly power must passively concede everytime someone else demands the 
right to do some portion of what that firm does, regardless of whether the services at issue are performed within the scope of the 
lawfully acquired monopoly and regardless of whether the ""monopolist"" is merely conducting itself in the way that any other (non-
monopolist) firm would under the circumstances. "
42,18," Cf.  Berkey Photo, 603 F.2d at 275-76 (noting that the ""monopoly leveraging"" theory is ""linked to the prohibition against tying 
arrangements in the sale of goods and services,"" and citing to, inter alia, Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 
U.S. 594, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953). In the Times-Picayune case, the Court held that there can be no unlawful 
leveraging via ""tying"" where the tied and tying products are part of the same market and are thus indistinct.  Id. at 613-14). "
43,19," SMUD's stance, in essence, is that if possession of monopoly power by dint of State law means that SMUD is exempt from 
federal antitrust regulation, then SMUD has a monopoly. If, on the other hand, SMUD is not immune under the ""state action 
exemption"" (see n.3, supra), then its otherwise conceded monopoly evaporates -- in this lawsuit, if not in real life."
43,20," Given the semantic stratagem adopted by SMUD, a standard dictionary definition of the term provides a handy point of 
reference: ""monopoly . . . 1: exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action 2: exclusive 
possession 3: a commodity controlled by one party 4: a person or group having a monopoly."" Webster's Seventh New Collegiate 
Dictionary 548 (1967).  I do not suggest that Webster's necessarily provides a viable definition of a term of art; rather, my resort 
to Webster's is merely an attempt to understand what is being said to the court. HN23[
] "
44,21," In the General Business Systems case, the Ninth Circuit described the ""dimensions"" of the relevant market as including ""the 
product involved, the geographical limits within which it functions, and the appropriate time frame."" 699 F.2d at 972. The last is of 
no particular moment in the instant case, for there is no suggestion by either side that the relevant market (however defined) has 
been undergoing any significant changes during the period relevant to this litigation.  See II Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law ยง 
12.2 at 325. HN25[
] "
46,22," The Standard Oil case arose under Section 3 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 14. HN31[
] It is well established, 
however, that the ""relevant market"" inquiry under the Sherman Act is identical to that employed in cases arising under the 
Clayton Act.  See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 573, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698; Twin City Sportservice 
Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1300 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1009, 103 S. Ct. 364, 74 L. Ed. 2d 400 
(1982). "
47,23," As an alternative definition for the appropriate geographical area, SMUD proposes that the court draw a circle around the 
State Capitol, and include the area within a 25 mile radius.  This may or may not provide a more accurate definition of the 
Greater Sacramento Metropolitan Area than can be derived from simply changing the defendant's service area. It would do 
nothing, however, to aid the court in determining the area of effective competition, for it would contain two distinct regions: One 
in which SMUD does not compete because it provides no service, and another within which SMUD need not compete because it 
provides virtually all of the electrical energy used. "
48,24," The plaintiffs also tender certain deposition testimony elicited from SMUD employees as evidence of the existence of 
""electrical distribution systems"" as a separate economic entity.  In the cited excerpts, the deponents do indeed refer to 
""distribution systems."" They generally do so, however, only after plaintiffs' counsel has introduced the term and repeatedly used 
it in the questions propounded.  (It will be noted that the court has also adopted the term, not because it is convinced that the 
term has any actual significance, but merely in order to respond to the allegations.  See n.5, supra).  Moreover, in context it is 
unclear whether the deponents are referring to the things defined by the plaintiffs as ""electrical distribution systems""; the 
witnesses could well be using the term to describe some larger or smaller portion of what they clearly think of as ""SMUD's plant."" 
The inquiry into the separability of energy from EDS is simply not susceptible to resolution through this sort of wordplay; nor can 
such a complex factual issue be resolved by putting buzz words in the mouths of witnesses.  In short, the court finds this 
""evidence"" wholly unpersuasive. "
50,25," It should be noted that if the court adopted the recognized alternative method of analyzing this issue, SMUD's position would 
be stronger still.  According to Kintner, the ""second approach that has been utilized to establish a product's 'separateness' is to 
focus on each product's market."" II Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law ยง 10.54 at 230.  The leading case putting forth this second 
analysis is Washington Gas Light Co. v. Virginia Electric & Power Co. (VEPCO), 438 F.2d 248, 253 (4th Cir. 1971). The facts of 
that case are remarkably similar to those of the case at bar.  The defendant, an integrated electric utility company, began 
installing ""'underground residential distribution' (URD) lines instead of the common overhead variety if the builder agreed to pay 
the additional expenses involved, usually amounting to a sum around $280."" Id. at 250. VEPCO subsequently decided to offer 
URD installation free to builders who ""went 'all electric.'"" Id. The local gas company sued, claiming, inter alia, that VEPCO's 
practices constituted an illegal tying arrangement under ยง 1.  The trial court held in favor of the plaintiff, but the Fourth Circuit 
reversed, ruling that the plaintiff had failed to show two separate products.  The court of appeals took the view that URD ""'is 
merely a method by which a product -- electricity -- is delivered to the consumer. [. . .] Underground Residential Distribution is 
ancillary to both the seller and the buyer in much the same way as a free meal given to an airline passenger is ancillary to the 
sale of an airline ticket.  Therefore, it is difficult to see how there could be a separate tying product in the commercial sense.'"" Id. 
at 254, quoting Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., 313 F. Supp. 860, 869 (M.D.Ga.1970). "
51,26," Given that the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this basic element of their EDS claim, it is not necessary for the court to reach the 
remaining elements.  It is by no means clear, however, that SMUD's activities could in any event be considered so 
""unreasonable"" as to constitute the taking of ""an unwarranted competitive advantage."" See the discussion in Part III of this 
opinion, supra. In this regard, I note the evidence tendered to the court showing that the cost to consumers would necessarily 
rise if someone other than SMUD did the disputed installation work.  Moreover, this fact raises the question of whether the 
plaintiffs can show ""causal antitrust injury."" See Forro Precision, 673 F.2d at 1058. The question of SMUD's alleged leveraging in 
the ""market"" for ""electrical distribution systems"" may well be moot if it turns out that SMUD would have captured that market in 
any event, by underpricing the plaintiffs through use of competitive advantages apart from use of monopoly power. See Berkey 
Photo, 603 F.2d at 288; see generally the discussion of plaintiffs' ""street and outdoor lighting systems"" claim, infra."
51,27," I observe in passing that the plaintiffs have made no attempt to detail the limits of this purported market, either in terms of what 
should properly be included in the product definition, or in terms of the geographic area in which competition actually exists.  
Thus, as noted in Part III of this opinion, it is virtually impossible for the court to gauge the economic significance of the conduct 
which the plaintiffs assert is unlawful.  Given the even more basic flaw in the plaintiffs' claim, however, it is unnecessary to 
plunge back into the thicket of market definition in order properly to dispose of the instant motion. "
52,28," Certain examples help illuminate this distinction.  ""A classic illustration [of the use of monopoly power] is an insistence that 
those who wish to secure a firm's services cease dealing with its competitors."" Berkey Photo, 603 F.2d at 275. Yet another 
""classic example of such a use is a refusal to deal in goods or services needed by a competitor in a second market.  But, a firm 
without control of the market that attempts this will simply drive the purchaser to take its patronage elsewhere."" Id. at 291 
(citation omitted).  Finally, in this opinion I have discussed the use of monopoly power to force a consumer to purchase a second 
product in combination with the product over which the seller exerts market control.  See Part V, supra. In each of these 
instances it is solely the monopolist's control of the primary market that permits it to act as it does, and to do so effectively.  This 
same factor is present in each of the cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of their contention that SMUD has used its monopoly 
power to gain advantage in the ""market"" for ""street and outdoor lighting systems."" See Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 
S. Ct. 941; Six Twenty-Nine Productions v. Rollins Telecasting, Inc., 365 F.2d 478 (5th Cir. 1966); Packaged Programs v. 
Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 255 F.2d 708 (3d Cir. 1958); City of Mishawaka, Ind., 465 F. Supp. 1320 (N.D. Ind. 1979). HN37[
] "
53,29," I note SMUD's assertion that its action is based upon safety considerations and the need to maintain the integrity of its poles. 
By reason of the foregoing analysis, it is unnecessary to determine whether these tendered justifications would be sufficient to 
justify its rule and thus not make its action ""unreasonable"" in any event. "
61,1," Upon the consent of the parties, this action was tried by the magistrate according to the procedure outlined in 28 U.S.C. ยง 
636(c). To facilitate discussion, the magistrate shall be referred to interchangeably as ""the court"" and ""the magistrate."" "
62,2," Once a trademark of the Ford Motor Company, the term ""Autolite"" is now owned by the Bendix Corporation. Ford presently 
affixes the trademark ""Motorcraft"" to all automotive parts, including its line of spark plugs."
62,3," Testimony concerning the details of this meeting, attended by Shirley Hornsby, her secretary, Patricia Vela, and Moeller, and 
the parties' understanding of the terms of the distributorship contract, is in sharp conflict. According to Shirley Hornsby and 
Patricia Vela, Moeller indicated that the contract barred the sale of competing spark plug lines, and restricted Hornsby from 
operating in ""Houston, Harris County, Texas."" Moeller denied this assertion. Both women testified that Moeller did not permit Ms. 
Hornsby to read the contract prior to signing, whereas Moeller stated that each of the signatories reviewed a copy of the 
document in the course of this meeting. Ms. Hornsby testified that her acquiescence in the exclusivity policy, as explained by 
Moeller, was dependent upon Champion's confirmation of Hornsby's appointment. Again, Moeller disputed this version of their 
exchange. "

requirement to be examined under rule of reason).  According to one commentator: There are many ""normal and usual agreements in aid of trade and commerce,"" . . . which involve the acceptance by the 
parties of limitations on their freedom individually to deal with others. . . . Requirements contracts, exclusive dealing 
contracts and contracts involving exclusive territories all involve limitations on the freedom of one or more of the parties to 
do business with others. . . . Because all of these situations involve an agreement between two or more persons under which one or more of them agree 
not to deal with other persons and for that reason foreclose a part of the market to such third persons, they're all subject to 
scrutiny under the anti trust laws. But in the ordinary case these do not involve combining for the primary purpose of 
coercing or excluding; rather they involve combinations of two or more persons to further directly the business of the parties 
to the agreement, and the effect on third parties and on competition is indirect. The issue in these cases is not the 
existence or nonexistence of concerted refusal to deal, but rather whether the purpose and effect of the operation of the 
contract, association, exchange or joint sales agency was such as unreasonably to exclude outsiders from participation in 
the trade in question. The principle of the group boycott cases -- that it is prima facie unreasonable for a dominant group to

after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation, or the reverse; but

69,12," The court's charge on Hornsby's section 1 claim is excerpted in pertinent part: The general objectives of the federal antitrust laws are to preserve and advance our system of free and open competition, 
and to secure to everyone an equal opportunity to engage in the business, trade, and commerce of this country. This policy 
is a primary feature of our private enterprise system. In this case plaintiff, Hornsby Oil Company, Inc., seeks money damages alleging two antitrust claims against defendant 
Champion Spark Plug Company, Inc. The first claim is made under a part of the federal antitrust laws known as Section 1 "
70,," of the Sherman Act. The second claim relates to Section 2 of the Sherman Act. After instructing you on the law governing 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, I will instruct you on the law as it pertains to Section 2 of the Act. Section 1 of the Sherman Act. This law provides, in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States is declared illegal."" The specific conduct which plaintiff claims violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act is an alleged conspiracy between 
defendant and plaintiff relating to the direct account distribution of automotive replacement spark plugs. Plaintiff alleges that 
the conspiracy between the plaintiff and the defendant required plaintiff, as a condition to becoming a direct account 
distributor for Champion, and as a continuing condition to remaining a direct account distributor for defendant, to cease 
dealing in competitive lines of spark plugs. Plaintiff further alleges that plaintiff and the defendant entered into a 
combination or conspiracy which restricted plaintiff's distribution of Champion spark plugs to a territorial area which did not 
include Houston, Harris County, Texas. In connection with these allegations plaintiff claims that defendant wrongfully 
terminated plaintiff's Champion distributorship contract because plaintiff failed to abide by the alleged conspiracy to cease 
dealing in competitive lines of spark plugs. Defendant denies it entered into any combination or conspiracy to require plaintiff to distribute defendant's products 
exclusively or which restricted plaintiff's sales territory. Defendant claims that it properly terminated plaintiff's distribution 
contract, unilaterally, for the reason that plaintiff falsely reported its sales to Champion. There are four essential elements which the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence in order to establish its 
claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as follows: First: That there was a contract, combination or conspiracy between the defendant and plaintiff, as alleged by plaintiff; Second: That such contract, combination or conspiracy constituted an ""unreasonable"" restraint of interstate commerce 
as hereafter defined; Third: That such contract, combination or conspiracy constituted a restraint of interstate commerce involving a not 
insubstantial amount of such commerce; and Fourth: That the plaintiff suffered injury in its business or property as a proximate result of the alleged contract, 
combination or conspiracy."
70,*," * * * The second element which the plaintiff must prove in order to establish its conspiracy claim is that the alleged conspiracy 
resulted in an ""unreasonable"" restraint of interstate commerce. The requirement that the restraint of trade be unreasonable is referred to as the ""Rule of Reason"" test of illegality. You are 
instructed therefore that ""restraint of trade"" as used in Section 1 of the Sherman Act applies only to unreasonable restraints 
and not to all possible restraints of trade. The antitrust laws seek to maintain free competition in interstate commerce in 
order to protect the public interest. The end sought by the antitrust laws is the prevention of unreasonable restraints in 
business and commercial transactions which tend to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control or affect the 
market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services; the public is to be protected in order to secure 
to them the advantages which accrue to them from free competition in the market. Not all restraints of trade are 
unreasonable restraints. All business affects trade in some way.  Therefore, in determining whether a ""restraint of trade"" 
exists, you must decide whether the conduct which you have found tends to restrict or otherwise control free and open 
competition. And in determining whether or not such an unreasonable restraint exists, you need not find a specific injury, 
but you must find that the conduct tends to or is reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest. The question of whether or not an alleged conspiracy constitutes an ""unreasonable"" restraint of interstate commerce must 
also be determined on the basis of full consideration of all of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence 
including the nature of the particular industry or the product involved; the market area involved; any facts which you find to 
be peculiar to that industry, product, or market area; the nature of the alleged restraint and its effect, actual and probable; 
the history of the circumstances surrounding the alleged restraint and the reasons for adopting the particular practice which 
is alleged to constitute the restraint. The law does not define which restraints are reasonable and which are not. It is for you 
to decide whether the evidence in this case shows an unreasonable restraint, and the plaintiff may not recover unless you 
find an unreasonable restraint by a preponderance of the evidence, as defined in these instructions. "
71,*," * * * The fourth element which plaintiff must establish as a part of its claim is that it suffered injury in its business or property as a 
proximate result of the alleged contract, combination, or conspiracy. It frequently occurs in the course of normal, lawful 
competition that some businesses may suffer severe economic losses. It is only when such economic losses are caused by 
unlawful competitive practices that the antitrust laws are violated. An injury to a business can be said to be the ""proximate 
result"" of an antitrust violation only when the act or transaction constituting the violation directly and in natural and 
continuous sequence produces, or contributes substantially to producing, such injury. In other words, the alleged violation 
or violations of the Sherman Act by the defendant must be a direct, substantial and identifiable cause of the injury which 
plaintiff claims to have sustained. In this case, plaintiff Hornsby Oil Company, Inc., also claims that defendant Champion Spark Plug Company, Inc. violated 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Section 2 of the Sherman Act. This law provides, in pertinent part: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, . . .  any part of the trade or commerce shall be . . . 
guilty of a . . . [violation of the antitrust laws.]"""

one ambulance company was allowed to operate in the city.  The court found that the city's actions were immune from the 
antitrust laws under the state action doctrine.  The Missouri statute, which the court was obligated to interpret, evidenced a clear 
state intent to displace competition when it specifically provided for state subdivisions to ""[c]ontract with one or more individuals, 
municipalities, counties, associations or other organizations for the operation, maintenance and repair of such vehicles and for 
the furnishing of emergency treatment."" Gold Cross at n. 9, quoting from the Missouri statute.  (emphasis supplied). By stating that a subdivision could contract with ""one or more"" ambulance services, the state of Missouri clearly envisioned that 
cities might want to displace competition and have a monopoly ambulance service.  Id.  By contrast, the California statute

private trash collector filed suit against the City of St. Paul, alleging that the city violated the antitrust laws when it entered the 
trash collection business.  Despite the fact that the equipment used to haul the trash originated in interstate commerce, the court 
found ""only a remote nexus to interstate commerce"" and therefore dismissed the complaint.  Id.  at 812. "

upon specific criteria to ensure that the settlement terms would serve the public interest. (footnotes and citations omitted).  Although, by its terms, the Tunney Act is not applicable to a termination proceeding, it 
provides useful guidance to the courts in deciding how modification procedures should be addressed. "

competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 49 n. 15, 97 S. Ct. at 2557 n. 15. The exceedingly general nature of these factors, and the absence of an 
analytical framework for applying the rule of reason, has been discussed by commentators of every persuasion.  See, e.g., ABA 
Monograph, supra, at 54-55; Posner, Per Se Legality, supra, 48 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 14-15; Pitofsky, The Sylvania Case: Antitrust

159,11," Then Professor, now Judge, Posner has clearly explained the rationale for this threshold requirement: The absence of market power in the interbrand market implies that the defendant is in competition with firms that sell 
products regarded by the consumer as close substitutes for the defendant's.  The defendant will therefore lose most or all of 
its sales if its retail price exceeds its competitors' retail price for any reason, including a lack of intrabrand competition that 
drives its costs of distribution up . . . . If a firm lacks market power, it cannot affect the price of its product; that price is 
determined by the market. "
160,," Posner, Per Se Legality, supra, 48 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 16.  See ABA Monograph, supra, at 62 (""To determine the significance of the 
effects of an intrabrand restraint on overall competition, the market power of the product on which the intrabrand restriction has 
been placed must be assessed."") The Seventh Circuit has subsequently followed Muenster Butane. See Valley Liquors, Inc. v. 
Renfield Importers, Ltd., 678 F.2d 742, 745 (7th Cir.1982) (Posner, J.)."
160,12, See note 1 supra.
160,13," Itek cross-examined Zatzos at considerable length, but did not dispute his testimony that platemakers were Itek's principal 
product.  Since Zatzos stated he had been an Itek employee for 13 years prior to founding GPD, the jury likely gave credence to 
this portion of his testimony. "
161,14," Malagamba indicated that purchasers of the A.B. Dick platemaker cartridge could break it open and use it in the Itek machine, 
and that Itek had once lost $400,000 in sales to an A.B. Dick dealer in that fashion, but this testimony seems only to reinforce 
the general point."
161,15," ""Product differentiation can be based on styling, packaging, advertising, service and other non-price competition.  To the 
extent that product differentiation has been created, a company will have additional freedom to raise the price of its product 
above that of competing brands while still retaining a substantial portion of its business."" ABA Monograph, supra, at 64.  For an 
introductory discussion of the economics of product differentiation, see P. Samuelson, Economics, 487-90 (10th ed. 1976)."
161,16," In addition to this testimony concerning market share and product differentiation, GPD also offered some direct evidence 
concerning market power.  Zatzos stated that, in competitive bidding for government contracts, Itek invariably bid from its retail 
price list.  Itek furnished these price lists to every branch office and distributor. Zatzos also said that Itek ""could sell . . . according 
to the price book.  We could sell -- we could dictate the price basically.  I mean, we could maintain a high price for the equipment 
with a high profitable margin."" Regarding platemakers, Zatzos said that interbrand competition had no effect on Itek's pricing 
structure.  He stated that he was able to sell them at a higher price than his competitors because the Itek platemaker was 
superior."
161,17," We are not unaware of the distinction between short-run monopoly power, which looks at market structure at any instant and 
corresponds to short-run power over price, and long-run monopoly power, which stresses the power to exclude rivals.  A firm 
may have short-term power to control price without any long-run ability to restrict competition.  See Schmalensee, On the Use of 
Economic Models in Antitrust: The Realemon Case, 127 U.Pa.L.Rev. 994, 1005-16 (1979). However, Itek offered no evidence 
indicating an absence of long-run market power. "
162,18," It should be clear from the textual discussion that follows that this systematic comparison does not necessarily involve a 
weighing or balancing of the effects of a restraint on intrabrand competition with its effects on interbrand competition.  The 
Supreme Court has cautioned about the difficulty inherent in such a weighing process.  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 
405 U.S. 596, 610-11, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1134, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). Under the rule of reason, the interbrand market context in 
which intrabrand restraints are imposed will often allow us to determine its effects on overall competition without recourse to a 
balancing analysis.  If a balancing of pro- and anti-competitive effects ultimately proves necessary, it would appear to be 
sanctioned by the Supreme Court.  See Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 57 n. 27, 97 S. Ct. at 2561 n. 27."
162,19, See note 11 supra and accompanying text.
162,20," The argument, pressed by Itek at length here, that the reduction or elimination of intrabrand competition is, by itself, never 
sufficient to show that a trade restraint is anticompetitive must rest, at bottom, on the view that intrabrand competition -- 
regardless of the circumstances -- is never a significant source of consumer welfare.  This view is simply not supported by 
economic analysis, or by the cases.  HN11[
] A seller with considerable market power in the interbrand market -- whether 
stemming from its dominant position in the market structure or from the successful differentiation of its products -- will 
necessarily have some power over price.  In that situation, intrabrand competition will be a significant source of consumer 
welfare because it alone can exert downward pressure on the retail price at which the good is sold.  Dealers, by competing 
against each other and bidding the retail price down, will in turn exert downward pressure on the seller's wholesale price in order 
to maintain their profit margins.  Thus, in situations of manufacturer market power, intrabrand restrictions on distributor 
competition can have a substantial adverse effect on consumer welfare by eliminating an important source of competitive 
pressure on price.  Rather than promoting nonprice competition, vertical restraints in this context may enable a manufacturer to 
retain monopoly profits arising from an interbrand competitive advantage.  Gerhart, supra, 1981 Duke L.J. at 426-29. See 
Coleman Motor Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 525 F.2d 1338, 1347 (3d Cir.1975) (where manufacturer has discretion to raise prices 
over interbrand competitors, elimination of intrabrand competition injurious to consumer welfare because it eliminates source of 
downward pressure on price). Itek misreads our statement in Daniels v. All Steel Equipment, Inc., 590 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1979) that ""a reduction in 
intrabrand competition is not pernicious as long as there exists interbrand competition, which acts as a 'significant check on the 
exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.'"" 
(quoting Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 53 n. 19, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 n. 19). Daniels was a case ""weaker than, although 
analogous to, the dealer termination cases.  We . . . look to those cases for the standard against which to test the propriety of 
summary judgment."" Id. at 112. We have emphasized time and again that mere termination of a dealer -- even an arbitrary and 
unfair termination -- does not constitute an antitrust violation actionable under the treble damages provisions of the Clayton Act.  
See, e.g., Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 575 F.2d 564, 571 (5th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 909, 99 S. Ct. 1218,

163,," ""The antitrust laws were designed to protect competition and not necessarily competitors."" Almeda Mall, Inc. v. Houston Lighting 
& Power Co., 615 F.2d 343, 354 (5th Cir.) (citing Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 
510 (1962)), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 101 S. Ct. 208, 66 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1980). Itek states in its brief to this court that GPD's claim is that Itek's distribution system violated the antitrust laws, and that GPD's 
termination was illegal only insofar as Itek's distribution system was illegal. In fact, Itek specifically distinguished the dealer 
termination cases from the present case in that the latter involves an allegedly unlawful system of distribution.  The Daniels 
language simply has no application outside of the dealer termination context, as the Second Circuit pointed out in Eiberger v. 
Sony Corp., 622 F.2d 1068 (2d Cir.1980). ""In both of these cases [Daniels and Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d 
Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1978), 454 U.S. 1083, 102 S. Ct. 639, 70 L. Ed. 2d 
618 (1981)] the only conduct alleged to be a violation was the termination itself. Each termination was effected pursuant to 
provisions of a dealership contract which contained no restraints that were challenged as unreasonable."" Id. at 1081.  Relying in 
part on a footnote in Sylvania suggesting that balancing intrabrand and interbrand competitive effects of vertical restrictions is a 
proper part of the judicial function, Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 57 n. 27, 97 S. Ct. at 2561 n. 27, the Second Circuit held: ""Unless we 
are to conclude that an anticompetitive impact on intrabrand competition cannot alone support a finding that ยง 1 [of the Sherman 
Act] has been violated . . . we must conclude [that such a violation has been proven here]."" Id. We note that the Sixth and Third Circuits, respectively, agree with the Second Circuit that intrabrand competition alone can be a 
significant concern of antitrust law, notwithstanding the Sylvania Court's observation that interbrand competition is ""the primary 
concern of antitrust law."" Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 52 n. 19, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n. 19. See Com-Tel, Inc. v. DuKane Corp., 669 F.2d 
404, 412 (6th Cir.1982); Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164, 166 n. 11 (3d Cir.1979)."
163,21," Indeed, one study indicates that ""the variety of justifications, economic and otherwise, which potentially might be offered for 
imposing intrabrand restraints are almost limitless."" ABA Monograph, supra, at 67."
163,22," The Second Circuit has explicitly rejected this argument, stating ""that a practice is not per se unlawful does not mean it is per 
se lawful."" Eiberger v. Sony Corp., 622 F.2d at 1076. Mere invocation of possible pro-competitive purposes will not suffice to 
legalize a restraint under the rule of reason. See text slip op. at 279, at 1576 infra."
163,23," In National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 690, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1364, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 
(1978), the Supreme Court endorsed a similar approach to plaintiffs' burden of proof.  Under the rule of reason 
""Unreasonableness . . . could be based either (1) on the nature or character of the contracts, or (2) on surrounding "
164,," circumstances giving rise to the inference or presumption that they were intended to restrain trade and enhance prices."" 
(footnote omitted)."
164,24," This allocation of burdens is consistent with our holding in Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 575 F.2d 564, 571 (5th 
Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 909, 99 S. Ct. 1218, 59 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1979), that ""the rule of reason standard hinges the 
ultimate legality of a restraint on whether the plaintiff has demonstrated an anticompetitive effect which is not offset by a need to 
achieve a pro-competitive benefit or justification."" (citations omitted)."
164,25," Pitofsky defines airtight territorial or customer allocation as absolute restrictions, where the dealer has exclusive rights with 
respect to that supplier's product or service in the designated area of sale. Pitofsky, supra, 78 Col.L.Rev. at 4 n. 10. He and 
other commentators have suggested per se treatment for airtight restrictions.  Id. at 28; Stewart and Roberts, Viability of the 
Antitrust Per Se Illegality Rule: Schwinn Down, How Many to Go?, 58 Wash.U.L.Q. 727, 758 (1980). We decline to adopt any 
rule which would ignore the totality of the circumstances present.  However, the nature of the intrabrand restraints is a highly 
relevant factor in rule of reason analysis. To the extent that intrabrand competition continues after imposition of intrabrand restraints, the effects of the intrabrand 
restraints on competition may be de minimis.  Situations in which intrabrand competition continues to be vigorous differ 
dramatically from those where the effect of the intrabrand restraint is to shut off all intrabrand competition.  See, e.g., Muenster 
Butane, 651 F.2d at 298 (defendant's efforts to restrict intrabrand competition largely ineffectual, intrabrand competition 
continued unabated); H & B Equipment Co., 577 F.2d at 246 (""Rivalry from [the supplier's other dealers in the relevant market] 
makes this situation far different from the exclusive territorial arrangements which introduced the intrabrand competition concept 
into antitrust law."")"
164,26," Moreover, as we discuss at note 30 infra, total suppression of intrabrand competition may not be reasonably necessary to 
achieve any legitimate pro-competitive purpose of the restrictions which may exist.  If so, questions may be raised about the real 
intent of the manufacturer in imposing them. "
165,27," The record reflects that following this incident, Itek's sales manager for special accounts wrote GPD warning it that it was 
""necessary and indeed vital"" that GPD observe its territorial boundaries.  The letter cautioned that an effective relationship 
required that each organization respect the other's boundaries."
165,28," Our independent review of GPD's customer invoices indicates that GPD's hourly service charge varied from $19.00 to $26.50.  
Itek did not bring this out in cross-examination, nor did it contest the general point that GPD charged significantly less for service 
than Itek did.  It did challenge one specific example that Zatzos gave of a lower service charge but, as indicated, did not 
challenge his general point."
165,29," There was also evidence indicating that GPD's presence in the Atlanta market would have contributed to competition as to the 
conditions and terms under which retail customers would be extended credit in making purchases. "
166,30," The record simply does not support Itek's contention that since it could eliminate its independent distributors by vertical 
integration and impose territorial restrictions on its own employees, its dual distribution system with territorial restrictions cannot 
constitute an unreasonable restraint on trade.  The record demonstrates that Itek used independent distributors because vertical 
integration was simply not economically feasible in the secondary markets to which the distributors were assigned; only 
distributors who could spread their costs over Itek and non-Itek products, like GPD, could survive as economic entities.  For a "
167,," discussion of other reasons why a supplier will prefer independent distributors over vertical integration, see Preston, supra, 30 
Law & Contemp.Probs. at 512. Much of Itek's argument to this court is devoted to a misplaced defense of its use of independent distributors, or what it calls its 
""expanded distribution system."" The distributional efficiencies achieved by resort to independent distributors over vertical 
integration are clear, and are not challenged by GPD here.  What is challenged are the territorial restrictions placed upon those 
distributors by Itek.  The effects of those restrictions on competition, and the relation of those restrictions to any legitimate pro-
competitive purpose Itek may have had, are the relevant issues."
167,31," In the only case in which the Supreme Court has been called upon to apply the rule of reason to vertical restraints, the Court 
considered whether the restraints were ""reasonably necessary to meet the competitive problems posed by [Schwinn's] more 
powerful competitors."" Schwinn, 388 U.S. at 380-81, 87 S. Ct. at 1866. See also White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 
270, 83 S. Ct. 696, 705, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (""Another issue . . . is whether . . . [the] operation [of 
these territorial restrictions] is reasonably related to the needs which brought them into being."") We agree with Professor Areeda that nothing in Sylvania indicates that inquiry whether the restraint is reasonably necessary to 
accomplish the manufacturer's legitimate business purposes is not an integral part of the rule of reason. As Professor Areeda 
states, the Court's failure to make anything turn on [Sylvania's] choice of the less restrictive limitation does not imply indifference to 
the relative severity of related restraints.  Rather, the Court decided that such difference was an insufficient basis for a per 
se condemnation of one while allowing the other. . . .  But the Supreme Court itself did not decide the reasonableness of 
the restraint before it. Areeda, The ""Rule of Reason"" in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 9 (Federal Judicial Center Monograph 1981).  We note that 
this interpretation is supported by the district court's decision on remand in Sylvania, which upheld the restraints in part because 
it was one of the less restrictive methods Sylvania might have used to strengthen its market position.  461 F. Supp. 1046, 1052 
(N.D.Cal.1978). The Former Fifth Circuit implicitly endorsed a reasonably necessary test when it stated ""the evil of territorial allocation is the 
restriction on the distributor's ability to sell outside his territory. Requiring a dealer to provide adequate service inside a territory 
does not injure competition."" Kestenbaum, 575 F.2d at 572-73 (emphasis in original).  Numerous courts have explicitly endorsed 
the reasonably necessary test, see, e.g., Donald B. Rice Tire Co., 483 F. Supp. at 758 (citing cases); American Motor Inns, Inc. 
v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230, 1248-49 (3d Cir. 1975) (citing cases), as have commentators, see, e.g., ABA Monograph, 
supra, at 57-58. We agree that the reasonably necessary standard helps to illuminate both the manufacturer's motive in 
imposing the restrictions and the effects of the restriction on competition overall. Itek's failure to show that the abolition of 
intrabrand competition was reasonably necessary to achieve its legitimate, competitive purposes, is thus of considerable 
importance to our analysis.  For a discussion of other techniques available to a supplier to achieve the purposes Itek sought 
here, see Pitofsky, supra, 78 Col.L.Rev. at 4-5. "
168,32," Nor was there any evidence indicating the existence of, or potential for, a free-rider problem requiring territorial restrictions to 
ensure such service."
168,33," Using spatial location market theory, Professor Preston has persuasively demonstrated how territorial restrictions on 
distributors can increase market penetration by enhancing the depth of market coverage. Preston, supra, 30 Law. & 
Contemp.Probs. at 512-19.  We do not dispute this theory or its possible application to a system of territorial restraints; however, 
Itek presented no proof whatsoever linking its restrictions -- as opposed to its use of independent distributors -- to depth of 
market coverage."
168,34," Itek's other contention regarding liability -- that the jury instructions misstated the applicable law -- lacks merit.  The court's 
instructions did not limit the jury's attention solely to intrabrand competition.  The court told the jury that plaintiff must prove that 
the territorial restrictions attacked had an anticompetitive effect which was not offset by a need to achieve a pro-competitive 
benefit or justification.  It also explicitly informed the jury that, in determining the effect on competition in the totality, it must 
consider both intrabrand and interbrand effects.  We have already discussed Itek's argument that the elimination of intrabrand 
competition can never suffice to show that a restraint is anticompetitive. See note 19 supra.  There was no error in these 
instructions. "
169,35," Any such contention would be frivolous.  Itek did not dispute Zatzos' testimony that GPD's sales decreased by $155,000 in the 
year following Itek's termination of GPD's distributorship. We have previously held identical evidence -- a significant decline in 
gross sales in the year following termination of a distributorship -- to be sufficient evidence of causation of antitrust injury in fact.  
Greene v. General Foods Corp., 517 F.2d 635, 665 (5th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 942, 96 S. Ct. 1409, 47 L. Ed. 2d 348 
(1976)."
169,36," We emphasize the posture of the case, see text at 1566 supra, because once a plaintiff establishes the fact of damage, as 
GPD did here, ""a directed verdict against that plaintiff on the amount of damages is proper only in the most unusual 
circumstances."" Malcolm v. Marathon Oil Co., 642 F.2d 845, 858 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1125, 102 S. Ct. 975, 71 L. 
Ed. 2d 113 (1981). "
170,37," Proof of the diminution in the going concern value of a business is ascertainable by comparing the fair market value of the 
business before and after the antitrust violation.  See Pollock & Riley, Inc. v. Pearl Brewing Co., 498 F.2d 1240, 1245 (5th 
Cir.1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 992, 95 S. Ct. 1427, 43 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1975). Testimony of business appraisal experts as to 
what a hypothetical willing buyer would pay a hypothetical willing seller on the open market would be one method of establishing 
loss in going concern value."
170,38," With respect to lost future profits, we note that when damages must be assessed to approximate lost future profits, a court and 
jury necessarily enter the realm of the imprecise and uncertain.  Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 45 (5th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1972). (Lehrman I).  We have held that it is therefore particularly 
appropriate to apply the less rigorous standard of proof discussed supra, at 1578-1579.  See Malcolm v. Marathon Oil, 642 F.2d 
at 864. "
171,39," These financial statements -- albeit undoubtedly susceptible to strong challenge via cross-examination or contrary testimony, 
neither of which was forthcoming from Itek at trial -- were not on their face of such a nature as to require an expert to assist the 
jury in understanding them.  We have previously held that an expert's testimony is not necessary to measure damages based on 
past sales and profit margins.  Malcolm v. Marathon Oil, 642 F.2d at 858. If, in a given case, a person of ordinary intelligence 
could analyze the documentary evidence in light of sound instructions, an expert will not be required.  Cf.  William H. Rankin Co. 
v. Associated Bill Posters, 42 F.2d 152, 156 (2d Cir.1930) (""The financial history of the [plaintiff's] business was in the case. 
Perhaps the jury was not as competent to analyze that evidence as some financial and business expert might have been, but it 
could draw its own reasonable conclusion from it. . . .  The jury had the data before it, and was left to determine the damages 
from that in what may be called its raw state.  Perhaps the testimony of someone competent to have estimated the business loss 
resulting from the defendants' acts would have helped, but it was not indispensable."") In this case, we have an accountant's compilation or recapitulation statement of GPD's financial position in the form of net 
profits. It characterized that position in language clearly conforming to the relevant measure of damages.  Since it had probative 
value, the adversary process determined its weight.  See note 40 infra."
171,40," The following table summarizes this data: Net Profit or (Loss): Year Ended December 31, 1975 ($ 4,531.62) Quarter Ended March 31, 1976"
171,8," ,440.98 Quarter Ended June 30, 1976 (847.61) Quarter Ended September 30, 1976 (5,325.62) Year Ended December 31, 1976 (10,684.82) Year Ended December 31, 1977 (26,238.21) "
172,41," We cannot emphasize too strongly that we do not have before us for review a challenge to the court's instructions to the jury 
on damages.  Itek did not challenge them at trial, and thereby waived its right to assign them as error on appeal.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 
51.  We do not condone, however, the district court's failure to distinguish between net and gross profits in its charge.  We note, 
though, that GPD's proposed charges contained such a distinction, a distinction more favorable to Itek than to it under the 
circumstances.  Itek did not request an alternative charge.  The court inexplicably omitted to give GPD's charge. For an 
instruction containing this important distinction, see Lehrman I, 464 F.2d at 44 n. 14. We must also stress that the parties have not provided us with the closing arguments of counsel. Therefore, we do not know 
how they urged the jury to calculate damages and are not in a position to determine how it arrived at its figure of $200,000.  
Finally, we underscore the essential role of the adversary process in determining the weight and reliability of the proof of 
damages.  The jury as factfinder, assisted by counsel, must judge the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicting evidence and 
claims, and assess the weight to be given damages testimony.  Lehrman II, 500 F.2d at 668; Terrell v. Household Goods 
Carriers Bureau, 494 F.2d 16, 24 (5th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 246, 42 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974); Hobart 
Brothers v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 471 F.2d 894, 903 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 923, 93 S. Ct. 2736, 37 L. Ed. 2d 150 
(1973). "
173,42," Zatzos' testimony about the age and health of Itek's principals, coupled with their desire to remain in business, sufficed to 
allow the jury to estimate the duration of future profits. Malcolm v. Marathon Oil, 642 F.2d at 864; Lehrman II, 500 F.2d at 670-
71. ""The duration of the period during which the plaintiff might be expected to profit . . . is susceptible of no precise formulation, 
and must be left to the processes of the jury informed by the presentation of conflicting evidence."" Lehrman I, 464 F.2d at 47. 
Itek presented no such conflicting evidence, on this or any other point pertaining to GPD's damages."
173,43," The burden of showing that GPD failed to minimize its damages rested with Itek.  Malcolm v. Marathon Oil, 642 F.2d at 863 
(citing cases). "
179,*," Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
195,1," The federal antitrust claim asserted by Stauffer is brought under HN1[
] section 1 of the Sherman Act which provides: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among several 
states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
195,15," U.S.C.  ยง 1. State claims are based on the closely analogous HN2[
] Minnesota Antitrust Act of 1971 which provides: A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons in unreasonable restraint of trade or commercy is unlawful.  
Minn. Stat.  ยง 325D.51. Subd. 1.Without limiting Section 325D.51, the following shall be deemed to restrain trade or commerce unreasonably and are 
unlawful: (1) A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons in competition: (a) for the purpose or with the 
affect of, fixing or controlling or maintaining the market price, rate, or fee of any commodity or service; (b) affecting, fixing, 
controlling, maintaining, limiting or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale or supply of any service, for the 
purpose or with the effect of affecting, fixing, controlling, or maintaining the market price, rate, or fee of the commodity or service; 
or (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets, functional or geographical, for any commodity or service.  (2) A contract, 
combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons whereby, in the letting of any public contract, (a) the price quotation of 
any bid is fixed or controlled, (b) one or more persons refrains from the submission of a bid, or (c) competition is in any other 
manner restrained. Minn. Stat.  ยง 325D.53 "
197,2," Stauffer argues that dismissal of its antitrust claims could leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.  Even 
if CCC were able to pass-on a portion of an antitrust injury by way of its tort action, however, it has an incentive to bring an 
antitrust claim itself if it could recover treble damages. The U.S. Attorney is specifically charged with the responsibility for 
enforcing the antitrust laws. See 15 U.S.C.  ยง 4. The four year statute of limitations (see 15 U.S.C.  ยง 15b; Minn. Stat.  ยง 325D.64(1)) would not necessarily bar any potential 
antitrust claim by CCC.  For example, HN7[
] fraudulent concealment of the existence of a cause of action based upon ยง 4 of the Clayton Act suspends the statute of limitations until the fraud is discovered.  City of Kansas City, Missouri v. Federal Pacific 
Elec. Co., 310 F.2d 271 (8th Cir. 1962)."
197,3," The parties cite only federal decisions on the antitrust issues and appear to agree that the test for standing under law even 
where an issue of Minnesota antitrust law is presented.See e.g., Minnesota-Iowa Television Company v. Watonwan T.V. 
Improvement Association, 294 N.W.2d 297, 305 (Minn. 1980). "
202,1," Since the parties were sent forward in 1977, armed with a new ""test"", by which the merits of this Court's jurisdiction would be 
assessed, the amount of discovery conducted has fleshed out both the allegations of misdeeds on both sides, as well as 
sufficient material from which this Court can evaluate the comparative interests of the United States and Honduras in this matter. Needless to say, the assortment and volume of the submitted materials present more than adequate documentation of these 
interests; sifting through the materials has taken this Court much time and involved much research.  Compare Zenith Radio 
Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial, 494 F. Supp. 1161, 1167 (E.D. Penn. 1980), where Judge Becker faced with a similarly 
acrimonious, and factually complex antitrust suit, addressed many of the same mechanical and substantive problems we were 
presented with here."
202,2," Defendants have moved for judgment on alternative grounds of no extraterritorial jurisdiction, or summary judgment on the 
merits of plaintiffs' antitrust complaint on June 6, 1981.  Further briefing of the various issues immediately relevant to those 
motions was complete on March 28, 1983. "
203,3," Timberlane Lumber Co., a general partnership with its principal offices in Eugene, Oregon, and other offices in Florida and New 
York, New York, purchases and wholesales lumber through a network of dealers across the country.  Timberlane's principals 
include both general and limited partners; the exact number and identity of which fluctuated during the course of events with 
which this Court is concerned.  Although the number of financial interested parties has ebbed in recent years, E. H. Robbins 
(""Robbin"") continues to be the managing partner, and will primarily benefit from any recovery."
203,4," Lima Y Hijos, S. de R.L. (""Lima"") was the Honduran limited partnership, through which Timberlane's partners hoped to enter 
the Honduran lumber market.  Prior to Timberlane's entry into this market, at least two Honduran companies, Lima and Jose 
Lamas, S. de R.L. (""Lamas"") competed in the milling and distributing of native pine to domestic and some limited foreign 
markets.  Lima operated a sawmill and remilling plant at Tegucigalpa, and jointly owned 50/50%, with Lamas, a nearly identical 
plant nearby.  While partners, this relationship enabled them to control prices paid for the various raw lumber stocks they 
purchased from small mill owners, and subsequently resold as rough lumber. Lamas later bought Lima out, leaving the two 
companies in bitter competition for the business that they had formerly shared."
203,5," Due to diminishing supply of timber in the Northwest, where the Timberlane partners also own and operate milling facilities, 
Timberlane thought it prudent to seek additional supply of lumber for sale in the U.S. and Canada.  It turned to Honduras since, 
despite an apparent lack of experience or the appearance of comparable development of its industries, the principals were 
convinced by Smith that it offered an abundant source of commercial quality lumber with cheap labor and transportation costs."
203,6," Danli was organized in May 1971 to acquire Honduran timber and operate a mill sixty miles from the Honduran capitol of 
Tegucigalpa. Intermittent land title disputes with the native Indian squatters (""campesinos"") on the property Danli planned to log 
prevented effective operations until December, 1972, and again beginning in March, 1973."
203,7," Maya was organized as a shell corporation in December, 1971, with $2500 capital for the purpose of taking over and operating 
a sawmill in Tegucigalpa.  With $170,000 funneled to Honduras by Timberlane partners through the Panamanian corporation 
controlled by Smith, Maya was actually the entity which attempted to acquire the principal assets of Lima, in January, 1972."
203,8," During the fall of 1970, Francisco Lima negotiated with the Bank of America's Tegucigalpa Branch manager, Nasser Bonheur, 
to increase his line of credit to $250,000 securing it with a general obligation mortgage.  The Bank's branch had served as "
204,," Lima's principal banker since 1968, when the Bank first extended funds in exchange for a form of security interest, discussed 
infra."
204,9," Lima became ill shortly after the Bank increased the firm's line of credit in 1970; his sons, chiefly headed by Ricardo, attempted 
to manage the company in his absence.  After receiving additional personal guarantees of certain family members, the Bank 
granted Lima an additional $200,000 credit for working capital purposes, upon conditions that: (1) the company change from a 
partnership to a corporation; and (2) the family contribute its personal loan accounts to the capitalized value of the company, 
thereby increasing the appearance of the company's net worth to over $1 million.  However, these additional funds were never 
made available to the company."
204,10," Francisco Lima died in February, 1971, his sons were losing money at the mill, and by May, 1970, the Bank had evaluated its 
outstanding loan commitment to Lima as ""not bankable"".  The regional office of the Bank, located in Guatemala, instructed the 
Branch to liquidate the Lima account."
204,11," On, or about, April 30, 1971, Banco de Honduras, S.A., another creditor of Lima, brought a foreclosure action before the 
Juzgado Primero de Letras de lo Civil (First Civil Court of Record) in Honduras.  That Court issued an ""embargo"", or court-
ordered attachment, on the Lima assets; but, before a public sale of the property could be held to satisfy that claim, the Bank 
and another creditor, Pedro Casanova y Hijos, S. de R.L., separately intervened in the lawsuit, each claiming priority of security 
interests, relying respectively upon a hipoteca de empressa, and on a pledge of lumber. The two banks later settled their rival 
claims, with the Bank taking priority; the Bank and Casanova combined and factored their loans to a third-party agent Caminals, 
for collection."
204,12," Casanova, trying to obtain the approximately 800,000 board feet of lumber which it claimed under the terms of its loan, 
brought two other proceedings: one in the Second Labor Court of Record, and one in the Second Civil Court of Record."
204,13," On August 12, 1971, the Bank filed a separate action against Lima in the First Civil Court of Record to foreclose on the hipotec 
and to enjoin the recording of the attempted conveyance by Lima to the labor union, to settle outstanding wage claims of its 
workers; see text at n. 14, infra. Banco de Honduras and Casanova joined in this action, claiming the conveyance of inventories 
by the Labor Court to the unions was illegal.  The Civil Court upheld the Labor Court on October 22, 1971; on appeal, the 
Supreme Court ruled that the adjudication of the machinery and equipment had been legal, although Casanova had a prior lien 
on the lumber inventories. "
205,14," On November 17, 1971, the Syndicate offered the Bank the opportunity to buy the machinery and equipment adjudicated to 
labor to protect the Bank's first mortgage position.  Two days later, Bonheur, after consulting the Bank's San Francisco 
headquarters, responded that the Bank was not interested and that the Syndicate ought to take whatever course it felt in the 
best interest of the former workers.  In January 1972, the Lima conveyance was entered in the Public Registry."
205,15," On August 24, 1972, Caminals commenced a dispossession action in the First Civil Court of Record against Maya and its 
principal officers, Smith and Gustavo Lima.  Caminals alleged that he rightfully owned both the Bank's and Casanova's security "
206,," interests, and demanded that either the underlying debts ($250,000, in US) be paid, or the plant and equipment be surrendered.  
The Honduran court ruled that the Lima equipment that Maya claimed to have purchased from the union in January, 1972, had 
been encumbered with, and thus was subject to, these registered security interests."
206,16," In October, 1972, Caminals formally requested that Smith personally, and as Maya's representative, either turn over the 
encumbered property, or pay the underlying debt.  When Maya and Smith failed to comply, Caminals petitioned for, and 
obtained, further embargoes against Maya, as well as the appointment of three ""interventors"" who, under Honduran law, were 
charged with a type of trusteeship.  The interventors, in an attempt to review Maya's financial records and insure against 
diminution in the value of the embargoed property, took over custody of the mill. Caminals also petitioned, and the Honduran 
courts approved, deployment of the Honduran security police to guard the mill and prevent violence from erupting.  These 
prophylactic measures were only partially successful. Maya subsequently accused the trial judge of bias, and obtained a change of venue, a new judge, and replacement of the three 
interventors with a single interventor. After a number of inconclusive court proceedings, the First Court of Appeal in Honduras 
(Corte Primera de Apelaciones) held, in January, 1973, that the appointment and substitution of the single interventor was 
illegal, and deemed null and void.  The Court reaffirmed the substance of early judicial decisions, which had rendered the 
outside creditors, now Caminals, a priority, secured interest, superseding the purported transfer to Maya.  The original three 
interventors were reappointed; and, in April, 1973, Caminals petitioned the court to set a date for public auction of the property."
206,17," The Court will not recount the numerous incidents and allegations of illegal, illicit or duplicitous conduct offered by both sides 
in this suit.  To the extent that this conduct constituted actionable tort, these torts were cognizable under Honduran law, if 
criminal behavior, it was up to the Honduran officials to prosecute internal criminal codes."
206,18," During the following 18 months, Maya sought review of each decision in Caminals' favor, thereby delaying the public auction 
and judicial sale until October, 1975, when Caminals acquired the embargoed assets for about $190,000.  Although Maya had 
maintained that it would file a civil suit for damages it claimed resulted from Caminals' foreclosure action, it never commenced 
additional litigation in Honduras. "

207,22," The Ninth Circuit's opinion in Timberlane I specifically requires that HN1[

""standing"" to challenge those acts.  549 F.2d at 615."

208,24," We acknowledge that plaintiffs had sought additional discovery in connection with the merits of their allegations.  However, 
even assuming that Pazmino and Bonheur were within the subpoena range of this Court and were to testify substantially as the 
plaintiffs proffer, our holding that we should not exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over the antitrust claims is founded on the 
plentiful record before us.  Whether or not Bonheur ""made a bundle"" from his actions on the Bank's behalf, we assume that the 
Bank and the Branch mutually reached the decision to liquidate the outstanding Lima loans, and not to negotiate a settlement 
with Timberlane.  Although we might have some reservations about entering summary judgment on the defendants' behalf with 
outstanding discovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), we have no such hesitation under this jurisdictional inquiry.  See, e.g., Lucas "
209,," et al. v. Bechtel Corp., 633 F.2d 757, 758 (9th Cir. 1980). We note that the Circuit, as well as district courts in this and other 
circuits, carefully scrutinizes summary dispositions in factually complex litigation; we have applied a rigorous standard of proof to 
defendants' claims of plaintiffs' deficiencies of evidence on the Timberlane I tripartite test, and conclude that, on the issues 
material to that determination, there is neither material issue of fact to be culled from the submissions, nor is there inference or 
reference to such evidence favorable to plaintiffs which, even taken in the most favorable light to defeat dismissal, could support 
such a result.  C.f., Smith v. Gross, 604 F.2d 639, 641 (9th Cir. 1979); Black v. Payne, 591 F.2d 83, 89 (9th Cir. 1979). Also see,

consider Laker's allegations.  This case and Laker, supra, are easily distinguishable on their facts (see Laker, supra, at n.21 and 
22); indeed, Laker is a recent touchstone of an appropriate extraterritorial application of U.S. antitrust laws. "
211,29," Act of state emerged after Timberlane I, at least in this Circuit, as a much more restrictive and arguably more effective defense 
to application of U.S. antitrust laws, inter alia. The new criterion appears to be whether the exercise of sovereignty involves the 
public interests of the foreign state, as compared with the interests of private citizens.  Timberlane I at 605, quoting Restatement 
(Second) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States ยง 41 Comment d (1965).  Under this standard, the decisions of the 
lower courts of Honduras were no longer sacrosanct from this Court's scrutiny, simply because each was an official expression 
of a sovereign state's view of private property interests within its boundaries, or as between individuals submitting themselves to 
its jurisdiction. However, we do not take the Circuit view of act of state beyond its reasonable meaning.  For example, clearly we should not 
immunize the Bank or its agents, simply because they have secured one or more favorable court decisions adjudicating their 
superior claim to certain assets in Honduras.  Here, these court decisions both (1) merely provide part of the right factual texture 
of intrigue in this case; and, (2) appear to be only a neutral application of Honduran law.  C.f., Clayco Petroleum Corp. v. 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., 712 F.2d 404 (9th Cir. 1983). But, we do not look beyond the face of the court proceedings, unless 
violative of a properly extraterritorial restriction like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or Securities Act of 1933 on its own merit, 
to ""impugn or question the nobility of a foreign nation's motivation."" Timberlane I, 549 F.2d at 607."
211,30," There is room however, for consideration of the extent and quality of redress that a dispute, which presents itself to a U.S. 
court, has been afforded in another jurisdiction, as part of the third prong of the ""Timberlane test"".  In probing the value or 
intrinsic propriety of juxtaposing our antitrust doctrine into a ripened tort suit, we do take note of the exhaustive scrutiny which 
the parties underwent in Honduras, and the juridical facts that emerge from that litigation. We feel that courts are appropriately sensitized to the ""gray"" area between absolution upon act of state considerations, and 
discounting any government interests which fall short of this rigorous standard.  Here, we feel that the fact that this litigation 
centers around the lumber industry of Honduras, certainly a crucial aspect of its patrimony, demands that we interject our 
antitrust overlay more cautiously because comity contemplates such sensitivity.  In this regard, brief mention should be made 
about the effect, if any, of an official expression of the Honduran government, which is one of those ""gray areas""."
211,31," In the diplomatic Note 148, the executive branch of the Government of Honduras expresses some concern over the effects 
that this litigation may have in three respects.  First, that the antitrust complaint in this action is based upon notions of law which "
212,," are ""unrecognized"" in Honduras.  Second, that the lawsuit seeks to rehash a matter finally litigated in Honduras, with a res 
judicata effect.  Third, the action seeks to regulate conduct in a state-regulated (COHDEFOR) industry.  Additionally, plaintiffs 
were, by official communication from the Honduran Attorney General, offered an ""adequate"" forum in Honduras for dispute 
resolution.  DX 179.  Notwithstanding this Note, and the defendants' arguments, we do not accord this communication much 
independent significance.  When compared to the vehement opposition mustered in other instances of extraterritorial application 
of U.S. laws, this solicited communication pales.  See Atwood & Brewster, supra Chapter 4: Foreign Interests and Reactions, 
pps. 82-86.  We do consider it within our balance of comity issues, infra, along with a survey of Honduran law applicable to this 
dispute."

214,33," Timberlane I, supra, at 615. The Circuit did not consider on appeal the issue of whether the apparently twice-removed injury 
for which Timberlane seeks redress here is sufficient to confer antitrust standing.  We believe that the double attenuation: first, 
because the allegedly anticompetitive acts were directed at Lima, not Maya; and second, because, at best, Timberlane's interest 
in the activities of Maya was that of a shareholder, would normally bar Timberlane from suit, for lack of standing. "

216,35," Plaintiff alleges that, at its height, Maya and Danli were responsible for approximately one and one-half percent of the pine 
market in the U.S., in the relevant product markets.  Although this may be a sufficient showing to satisfy the first prong of the 
three-prong test, we do not consider this of such a magnitude to carry the day on the third prong.  C.f., Daishowa Intern'l v. No.

216,37," Nothing in plaintiff's affidavits, especially affidavit 27 prepared by Serapio Hernandez Castellanos, then Attorney General of 
Honduras, dispels this conclusion.  Although, upon summarizing relevant sections of the Commerce code; e.g., Articles 422, 
423, 424, and 425, he apparently concluded, in response to a very abstract hypothetical question, that (the) Government of Honduras would not object to the exercise of antitrust laws, if such application does not violate or 
waive the fulfillment of the Honduran rights, both internal and international, and does not harm Honduran persons, or 
otherwise compromise or harms (sic) our sovereignty. Castellanos aff. at 4, this is not the inquiry before this Court.  Our inquiry is not merely whether we could legitimize an antitrust 
inquiry into the actions of various parties in Honduras, but rather whether we should."
216,38," Our understanding of the Circuit's guidance upon remand for our application of this new test, is that compatibility of the two 
legal systems is necessary, but not sufficient to rest extraterritorial jurisdiction upon.  Having concluded that the United States 
and Honduras laws (see A Statement of the Laws of Honduras in Matters affecting Business, 4th ed., Ramirez, Dante Gabriel 
and Ramirez, Roberto, General Secretariat, Organization of American States, Wash. D.C., 1981, pps. 177, 202-203, 232-233) 
are in theoretical harmony on monopolistic business practices, banking and security interests, we note an inclination in the 
Honduran law to reserve more power over foreign investment in their country.  Certainly, this is the sovereign's prerogative; 
however, under this orientation, and in view of the identity in approach to monopolization that plaintiffs urge between the U.S. 
and Honduras, we deem it particularly appropriate that plaintiffs have waged their litigation in Honduras.  We see no prejudice to 
them by pursuing their theories in that country; in the balance, when viewed alongside the countervailing public policy interest in 
not becoming an officious intermeddler in other nations; internal affairs, when those affairs have only a de minimums effect on 
our commerce, the inhospitality of this Court's forum is an appropriate result of a more appropriate forum elsewhere. "
217,39," See, e.g., Atwood & Brewster, supra, ยง 5.11, esp. at 126."
217,40," See Panel Discussion, 49 Antitrust Law Journal, supra, at 1221-1222."
217,41," For recent cases describing the modern approach to forum non conveniens, see, e.g., Laker Airways Limited v. Pan American 
World Airways, et al., 568 F. Supp. 811 (D.D.C. 1983), slip op. at pps. 6-7; Cheng v. Boeing Co., et al., 708 F.2d 1406,    , slip

the Bank has made a ""clear showing of facts"" which establishes that plaintiffs' prosecution of this action in this forum is an 
attempt to relitigate matters which already have been addressed in Honduras, as well as those speculative ""pie in the sky"" 
theories which, in light of ""considerations affecting the court's own administrative and legal problems"" applying U.S. antitrust 
laws to this affair, should have been properly before the Honduran courts instead.  Cheng, supra, slip op. at 1410, quoting

219,1," Though Arco does not agree with our decision on plaintiffs' ""increased cost"" claims, it does not for the purposes of the present 
motion challenge that decision."
219,2, The facts of Siegel and Shell may be found in our September 27 opinion.
219,3," The analogy to antitrust law is apt, as the TECA drew a like analogy in Siegel, 701 F. 2d at 153. The court's statement in that 
case that it had ""rejected the continuing violation concept under the DOE regulations,"" id., must be read in the context of the 
alleged violation at issue in that case, that is, an alleged refusal to deal beyond the limitations period that merely had harmful 
effects within the period."
219,4, Arco did not make this argument or point out the applicability of ยง 210.62 in its original motion for summary judgment.
219,5," Arco appears correct that the disposition of the challenge to pricing violations under Subpart L of the regulations, 10 C.F.R.  ยง 
212.183(a), does not help plaintiff here, for Subpart L had gone into effect within the limitations period in Johnson and thus none 
of the compliance decisions under those regulations had occurred outside the limitations period. "
220,6," We recognize that the TECA did not discuss the issue of accrual in Johnson. However, its statement remanding the case does 
not, as Arco suggests, leave open that issue but rather quite explicitly states that overcharges occurring within the limitations 
period are actionable. Our September 27 ruling was based on our determination, to which we still hold, that neither Shell nor 
Siegel controls this case and that Johnson (as well as the related antitrust doctrine referred to above) provides the most 
persuasive authority on the point in question here. "
224,1," The third-party plaintiffs are the Pennsylvania Dental Association (hereinafter PDA), Delaware County Dental Society, Erie 
County Dental Association, Inc., Harrisburg Area Dental Society, Luzerne County Dental Society, Montgomery-Bucks Dental 
Society, Odontological Society of Western Pennsylvania, Scranton Dental Society and York County Dental Society. "
225,2," On March 12, 1982, Blue Shield commenced a separate action by complaint identical to its counterclaim which was 
consolidated with the case at bar. "
226,3," Rule 401.4 obviously serves an important function in connection with any summary judgment motion.  It permits the Court to 
determine efficiently and precisely which material facts are in dispute and which are not.  The rule is particularly important in a 
complex case like this one which involves thousands of pages of depositions, documents and other materials arguably or 
potentially relevant to a summary judgment motion, and involving a plethora of contentions and claims most of which the 
plaintiffs have not articulated with precision and clarity.  Appended as Exhibit N to their motion for summary judgment, 
defendants have filed a statement of material facts pursuant to Rule 401.4.  Appended as Exhibit F to their brief in opposition to 
the motion, the plaintiffs have filed a counterstatement of material facts.  A review of the statements submitted by defendants 
and plaintiffs reveals that plaintiffs have made no reasonable effort to agree to facts that are not in dispute, and instead have 
caused it to appear that facts are in dispute when they are not.  The Court has examined these two sets of 87 numbered 
paragraphs submitted by defendants and plaintiffs.  In most of its numbered paragraphs, Blue Shield has set forth a clearly 
stated fact or set of facts.  In none of PDA's corresponding paragraphs is it indicated that Blue Shield's statement is undisputed, 
even though many of the paragraphs can not reasonably be disputed and even though PDA frequently, in other numbered 
paragraphs of its own, sets forth exactly the same facts.  It is confusing and serves no worthwhile purpose for purposes of Rule 
56 and Local Rule 401.4 for a party opposing summary judgment to refuse to acknowledge the existence of a fact advanced by 
a moving party if that fact can be established by the moving party and the opposing party has no evidence to refute it.  If the 
asserted fact is not material, that is a matter for argument.  If the asserted fact is material but the opposing party feels that "
227,," additional facts relating to the same subject matter as the asserted fact are also material, the opposing party need only (by 
affidavits, argument, etc.) demonstrate the existence of disputed issues of material fact."
227,4," Blue Shield employs a formula to calculate the ""usual"" charge, pursuant to which the dentist's charges for a given service for 
the preceding calendar year and the first three months of the current calendar year are utilized.  The ""usual"" charge is set at the 
seventy-fifth percentile of those charges.  A listing of a dentist's usual charges for the range of services the dentist provides, so 
calculated, is known as the dentist's profile.  Profiles are updated annually."
227,5," A dentist may be reimbursed more than the customary charge upon a demonstration of special circumstances relating to the 
particular service provided.  We believe this to be the ""reasonable"" element of the UCR procedure."
227,6," One of the provisions of the standard agreement between Blue Shield and a participating dentist is that the dentist will not 
charge a Blue Shield subscriber more than a non-subscriber for the same service. "
228,7," Non-participating dentists are ""profiled"" as to their usual charges the same as participating dentists by Blue Shield. Non-
participating dentists have no agreement with Blue Shield, but Blue Shield will not reimburse a subscriber who is treated by a 
nonparticipting dentist more than that dentist's ""usual"" charge."
228,8," See, Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980). "
229,9," "". . . Antitrust litigation, if made immune from summary judgment, could become an anticompetitive activity itself . . . we should 
use summary dispositions to dispose of antitrust complaints that lack any significant supporting evidence."" Klamath-Lake 
Pharmaceutical Assn. v. Klamath Medical Service, 701 F.2d 1276, 1281 (9th Cir. 1983)."
229,10," Although not clearly expressed in the third amended third party complaint, the contention is that Blue Shield, as a ""mere 
instrumentality"" of certain dentists, has acted to maintain the price of dental care ""at artificial rates."" Pre-trial order of third party 
plaintiffs at 38.  We construe this, as does Blue Shield, as a claim of horizontal price fixing, pursuant to Arizona v. Maricopa 
County Medical Society, infra."
229,11," The fact that less than 9% of the dental care in Pennsylvania is purchased by Blue Shield on behalf of its subscribers looms 
large.  The plaintiffs have made no showing or argument that the 91% of dental care for which there is not Blue Shield coverage 
will not seek out the lowest price for that dental care. HN5[
] - "
230,12," It is important to note, since this is a motion for summary judgment, that it is not testimonial evidence that PDA relies upon to 
establish and advance its ""conspiracy mechanism"" argument.  PDA does not point to conspiratorial conversations, the testimony 
of Blue Shield insiders or participating dentists to establish its conspiracy theory.  To the extent that its theory is at all factually 
supported, it is on the basis of circumstantial evidence: the Blue Shield Board ""rubber stamps"" its committees' recommendations 
and the dental committees are composed of a majority of participating dentists."
230,13," Our attention has been directed by PDA in a supplemental brief, to the case of St. Bernard General Hosp. v. Hosp. Service 
Ass'n of New Orleans, Inc., 712 F.2d 978 (5th Cir. 1983), as illustrative of ""effective"" provider control and of other points.  We 
believe, like Maricopa, St. Bernard is factually distinguishable from the case at bar since, in St. Bernard, each of the nine 
participating hospitals appointed two representatives to Blue Shield's thirty-one member board, the remaining thirteen members 
being elected by the eighteen members previously appointed."
230,14," Psychiatrists, who stood to gain by the practice, are physicians.  Clinical psychologists are not. "
231,15," The contentions by the plaintiffs that there is a per se illegal horizontal price-fixing scheme is considered, infra, slip op. pp. 19-
23 under the relevant case decisions. "
232,16," PDA's ""Market II"" is defined by it as the market in which ""individual dental firms sell bulk dental services to be provided directly 
to patients/subscribers at no cost to the latter."""
232,17," The instances in PDA's brief in which it states conclusory facts rather than particular facts, with extremely general citation to 
supporting proof or no reference at all, are legion."
232,18," An ""excepted"" dentist is a dentist who is not routinely required by Blue Shield to submit diagnostic aides for Blue Shield's 
review in connection with claims for reimbursement for dental services.  In 1979, Blue Shield began a practice of granting 
excepted dentist status only to participating dentists. It should be noted that the various practices of which complaint is made 
have been found acceptable by other courts.  See, e.g., Ratino v. Medical Service of District of Columbia, 1981-1 Trade Cas. 
(CCH) P 64,144 (D. Md. 1981), (direct payment to patients of non-participating doctors only and informing subscribers of 
participating doctors' lower fees not a boycott); Frankford Hospital v. Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia, 417 F. Supp. 1104 
(E.D. Pa. 1976) (publication of lists of participating doctors not a boycott); Quality Auto Body v. Allstate Insurance Co., 1980-2 
Trade Cases, P 63,507 (N.D. Ill. 1980), aff'd., 660 F.2d 1195 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1020, 102 S. Ct. 1717, 72 L. 
Ed. 2d 138 (1982) (analog to excepted dentist classification considered reasonable business practice).  We have been advised 
that Ratino, supra was reversed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 28, 1983.  See, Ratino v. M.S.D.C., 1983-
2 Trade Cases P 65,641. Although the reversal was based on grounds inapplicable here, the court in dicta did comment on the "
233,," price fixing and other claims.  Based on the thorough record before us, and the fact that this is a non-jury trial, we believe we 
have satisfied the analysis suggested in dicta by the court."
233,19," Dr. Comanor views Blue Shield as a purchaser of dental services.  He does not choose to view an insurance company as a 
purchaser of services because it pays for dental services at a set rate rather than on a UCR basis. "
235,20," Of course, as already noted, these percentage figures represent averages.  Blue Shield's reimbursement system compensates 
some dentists their full usual charge."
235,21," Besides relying on a fact that has not been shown, excess capacity, Dr. Comanor's concept that dentists will or would ""shift"" 
from insured to uninsured patients, or vice-versa, seems illogical, since it is doubtful that dentists would be in a position to 
concentrate on one group or the other."
235,22," PDA did file, on June 24, 1983 an affidavit of John G. Milakovic, pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
In the affidavit Mr. Milakovic (who is one of PDA's attorneys) testified to his belief that cross-elasticity of supply and demand 
between prepaid service benefit dental programs and ""commercial prepaid indemnity programs"" was very low.  To support these 
contentions, Mr. Milakovic offered to depose various witnesses whom he had been ""unable to contact."" Mr. Milakovic estimated 
that three weeks would be required to complete this process.  We believe the affidavit should have been accompanied by a 
motion, to give Blue Shield an opportunity to respond (See Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).  Further, we do not 
believe the extension sought is justified.  Ample time was allowed for discovery, and the discovery period has expired long ago.  
We find PDA's inability to support this most fundamental aspect of its case, if only by affidavits, both inexplicable and 
unacceptable.  In a related matter, PDA has moved to strike the affidavits submitted by Blue Shield to establish cross elasticity.  
Blue Shield has filed a motion to strike the motion and for counsel fees.  Although the affidavits contain some conclusory and 
inadmissible statements, they also contain useful and relevant information which we will consider.  We will not strike the 
affidavits or selected portions of them but will instead consider them for what they are worth.  The court is familiar with the rules 
of evidence.  PDA's motion to strike will be denied as will Blue Shield's motions to strike and for counsel fees."
235,23," The defendants have not pursued the proposition that self-insurance should be factored into the calculation of the percentage 
of the sales in the relevant market made by Blue Shield. However, considering the dynamics of collective bargaining and other "
236,," factors which determine whether groups of persons will have dental insurance at all or may opt for higher wages or some other 
benefit instead, self-insurance may be a viable competitor of Blue Shield. From the perspective of the individual purchaser of a 
Blue Shield plan, moreover, a resort to self-insurance may readily be chosen as an alternative to prepaid coverage if the price of 
prepaid coverage becomes relatively high.  If self-insurance is considered, then Blue Shield's market share in the relevant 
market is probably 9%, the percentage of dental services that are covered by Blue Shield insurance."
236,24," Specifically, by order of October 21, 1981, discovery was ordered completed by February 1, 1982, and trial was listed for 
February 3, 1982.  The third-party complaint was filed on November 17, 1981.  On February 1, 1982, at the request of PDA, the 
discovery deadline was extended to November 15, 1982, and trial was rescheduled to begin December 3, 1982.  On August 13, 
1982, the court accepted a magistrate's report recommending that the discovery deadline be extended to February 28, 1983, 
with trial to commence on April 4, 1983.  Subsequently, on January 18, 1983, the discovery deadline was extended to April 15, 
1983, and the case was moved to the June, 1983 trial list.  Although further requests for extension of the discovery deadline 
have been refused, trial of the case has been continued a number of times, most recently pending disposition of the instant 
motion. "
237,25," Although Blue Shield filed a motion for summary judgment on these claims, the motion was not timely since it was filed on the

244,1," For a more poetic version of the history of the McCarran Act, see Mertz, The First Twenty Years -- A Case-Law Commentary 
on Insurance Regulation Under the Commerce Clause, 1964 A.B.A. Section of Ins., Negligence & Compensation L. 153 (quoting 
remarks of H. McCallion at a symposium on insurance and antitrust law, New York, 1963) where the author states: In an ""old testament"" not related to mosaic law we may read of a compatible couple called Paul and Virginia, who are 
somewhat incompatibly referred to in prosaic law as Paul against Virginia.  And it is there written that Paul and Virginia lived 
in a wonderful Garden in which it was the law of the land that insurance was not commerce.  There they dwelled for 75 
years, calmly contemplating each other's virtues, unmindful of the rude competitive world beyond their Garden. Then in a ""new testament"" we may learn of a new association, rather unromantically called ""South-Eastern Underwriters"" 
which intruded upon the Garden of Paul and Virginia and drove them hence into the outer world where it was the law of the 
land that insurance was commerce and when it crossed state lines was interstate commerce. At once, the insurance children of Paul and Virginia became heir to the limitations and ills of the Flesh that had long 
plagued others who had not been so fortunate as to dwell in the Garden. We may read in detail what these limitations are in 
the Books of Sherman, Clayton, and Federal Trade Commission . . . . But there were many in the land of US who thought that the punishment so suddenly vented upon the insurance children of 
Paul and Virginia was much too severe.  It was not merely that each of them had to turn over a new leaf.  It was rather that, 
having lived in their innocence in the Garden for so long a period, they were ill prepared for this newly regulated mode of 
living and, moreover, they were truly different from the other inhabitants in form and in spirit. In order to ascertain what was done to loosen the bonds to which they became subject, we must turn now to the words 
found in the Act of McCarran . . . ."
244,2," As one commentator has observed, there are several overriding goals behind the regulation of the insurance industry; insurer 
solvency and reasonable rates.  Enforcement of the antitrust laws would further the goal of fair, reasonable and efficient rates.  
However, to some extent, competition would hinder the goal of maintaining insurer solvency.  The McCarran Act allows states to 
further the goal of insurer solvency by setting the rates for insurance premiums. The McCarran Act also represents a policy 
decision that the states should be free to regulate but that if the states refuse to regulate, the insurance industry should be 
competitive.  Carlson, The Insurance Exemption From the Antitrust Laws, 57 Tex. L. Rev. 1127, 1139 (1979)."
244,3," The McCarran Act was upheld in Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946). In 
Prudential the Supreme Court upheld, against a commerce clause attack, a state statute that taxed foreign insurers at 3% of the 
premiums from business within the state but imposed no tax on domestic insurers. It seems quite likely that the statute at issue 
in Prudential would have been unconstitutional absent the McCarran Act.  As a result of Prudential, Congress can delegate its 
commerce clause powers to the states and permit the states to exercise that power in a manner that, absent the delegation, 
would be a violation of the commerce clause. The Supreme Court correctly interpreted the congressional policy behind the 
McCarran Act by stating that Congress ""clearly put the full weight of its power behind existing and future legislation to sustain it 
from any attack under the commerce clause . . . .  Id. at 431. For an excellent history of the McCarran Act see M. C. Weller, The 
McCarran-Ferguson Act's Antitrust Exemption for Insurance: Language, History and Policy, 1978 Duke L.J. 587. "
245,4," It is clear that 15 U.S.C. ยง 1012(b) contains two distinct clauses.  The plaintiffs argue that the first clause applies and that this 
court should apply the antitrust laws because they do not ""invalidate, impair, or supersede"" a state law. The defendants argue 
that only the proviso of ยง 1012(b) applies to the present case.  The two sections of ยง 1012(b) apply in different situations.  The 
first sentence is intended to make state law supreme in any conflict with federal law unless Congress clearly expresses its intent 
to cover the insurance industry with a particular statute.  The proviso deals specifically with the application of the antitrust laws."
245,5," The plaintiffs do not concede that if the present conduct had occurred prior to 1979 it would have been protected by the 
McCarran Act.  Rather, they argue that the ""state action"" doctrine would have foreclosed antitrust liability."
245,6," Minnesota's decision to permit competition in the setting of premiums is part of a national trend favoring deregulation.  See L. 
Sullivan and J. Wiley, Recent Antitrust Developments: Defining the Scope of Exemptions, Expanding Coverage, and Refining 
the Rule of Reason.  27 UCLA L. Rev. 265, 272 (1979). As of 1979, sixteen states, led by California, adopted legislation giving 
individual companies freedom to set their own prices.  Id. Moreover, a recent Justice Department study concluded that restricted 
price competition would be an effective alternative to state regulation of property and liability insurance.  Dennis, The Justice 
Department Study -- An Update, 13 Forum, 920, 922-23 (1978). "
246,7," There is some support for the proposition that the first two elements of the McCarran Act test should be unified.  The first 
argument is based upon the language of the McCarran Act itself which states that the HN3[
] antitrust laws shall be applicable to the business of insurance ""to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law"".  15 U.S.C. ยง 1012. The second 
argument is based on a reading of congressional intent.  As one commentator put it: A more satisfactory approach would be to develop a ""business of insurance"" test explicitly aimed at limiting McCarran's 
scope to insurance company activities that can rationally be claimed to need anticompetitive regulation, such as the 
cooperative data gathering or risk posing arrangements mentioned earlier.  Specific state regulatory efforts would then 
guide the Federal Courts in identifying exempt ""business of insurance"" activities.  This approach would be consistent with 
McCarran's purpose of allowing states the authority to control the insurance business in the ways they think best. Some may object that such an approach confuses the three heretofore distinct McCarran tests.  The proposed test would 
indeed establish common ground between the ""business of insurance"" and the ""regulated by state law"" elements of the 
Act's tests.  It would also bring both of these elements into congruance with the proposed mode of interpreting the ""boycott, 
coercion, or intimidation"" exception . . . .  Perhaps the Court is en route to such an interpretation of the ""business of 
insurance"" test, but until it again speaks on the topic, these observations must remain speculative. L. Sullivan & J. Wiley, Recent Antitrust Developments; Defining the Scope of Exceptions, Expanding Coverage, and Refining the 
Rule of Reason, 27 UCLA L.Rev. 265, 285 (1979). By collapsing the ""business of insurance"" and ""state regulation"" elements, the 
test becomes essentially whether the legislature intended to permit certain conduct.  If it did, the antitrust laws would not apply. "
247,," If the legislature did not intend to permit certain anticompetitive conduct the antitrust laws would be the enforcement mechanism 
to carry out the legislature's will.  At a time when more and more states are deregulating the insurance industry in the hopes that 
increased competition will result in lower prices to policyholders it may well be that such an interpretation of the McCarran Act 
would best carry out public policy.  However, it is clear from Royal Drug, Pireno and St. Paul that a proper McCarran Act 
exemption analysis requires three analytically distinct steps."
247,8," As the Supreme Court stated in Royal Drug: One question not resolved by [the] legislative history is which of the various practices alleged in the South-Eastern 
Underwriters indictment Congress intended to be covered by the phrase ""business of insurance."" The indictment in that 
case had charged, for example, that the defendants had fixed their agents' commissions as well as premium rates.  It is 
clear from the legislative history that HN5[
] the fixing of rates is the ""business of insurance."" Group Life & Health Insurance Company v. Royal Drug Company, 440 U.S. 205, 224 n.32, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct.

249,10," The St. Paul court did not consider whether the challenged conduct constituted the ""business of insurance"" or was ""regulated

249,11," At oral argument in the present case both parties spent a significant amount of time arguing over the meaning of the term 
""boycott"".  Part of the confusion stems from the question of whether ""boycott"" has the same meaning in antitrust law as it does 
for purposes of the McCarran Act.  Though the issue has never been squarely decided, Justice Powell didn't think so in St. Paul 
when he stated the issue as ""whether the conduct in question involves a boycott, not whether it is per se unreasonable"".  St. 
Paul at 542. "

270,4," The Associated General test is further illuminated by the Supreme Court's actions in three circuit cases in which certiorari had 
been requested.  In the two cases in which antitrust standing had been granted, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, 
and remanded for further consideration in light of Associated General.  H.S. Crocker Co. v. Ostrofe, 460 U.S. 1007, 103 S. Ct.

270,5," The Supreme Court has injected into the ยง 4 standing inquiry an element of proximity: In the absence of direct guidance from Congress, and faced with the claim that a particular injury is too remote from the

271,6," Turner v. Johnson & Johnson, 549 F. Supp. 807 (D.Mass. 1982) was a similar action against the same defendant.  The court 
analyzed the alleged injuries under the Brunswick ""antitrust injury"" test and denied antitrust standing to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs included the trustees of the AMEC Liquidating Trust, which was the successor in interest to the AMEC company, 
and Robert Turner, who was the president and founder of the AMEC company and inventor of its line of ""Meditem"" electronic 
thermometers.  Id. at 809. J & J's subsidiary had developed and was to market its own ""Survalent"" electronic thermometer.  After 
extended negotiations, AMEC's assets were sold to J & J under a contract that apparently provided for royalty payments to 
plaintiffs based on the amount of future sales of Meditemp. The plaintiffs subsequently brought a suit for fraud and antitrust violations under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 
section 7 of the Clayton Act. The plaintiffs alleged that through fraud and misrepresentation, J & J acquired the assets of AMEC 
for the purpose of suppressing it and eliminating competition between AMEC's Meditemp thermometer and J & J's Survalent 
thermometer.  Id. at 809. It alleged that J & J made certain false representations during the contract negotiation; that J & J 
caused a patent interference proceeding to be filed to create a question concerning the validity of AMEC's patent to put AMEC in 
a difficult position if negotiations with J & J fell through; and that after acquisition J & J suppressed Meditemp by not providing 
sufficient funding, manpower, or equipment to develop and market successfully the product.  Id. at 809-10. Eventually, J & J 
discontinued Meditemp and never returned the business to AMEC, which was allegedly contrary to the written sales agreement.  
Id. at 810. "
272,7," An early case cited in Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488 n.13, as an example of an unsuccessful antitrust suit for damages for injuries 
unrelated to the reason the merger was prohibited is Peterson v. Borden Co., 50 F.2d 644 (7th Cir. 1931). The plaintiffs, as 
minority stockholders in Clover Leaf Milk Co., had alleged that the majority stockholders, in a conspiracy with the Borden Co., a 
milk business competitor, induced them through false representation to sell their stock to the majority for less than fair value.  Id. 
at 645. The majority then conveyed all the assets of Clover to Borden in exchange for Borden stock; Clover was then dissolved.  
The plaintiffs sued Borden for treble damage, alleging the effect of the transaction was to substantially lessen competition and to 
create a monopoly.  The court found that although the fraudulent conduct of the purchaser injured the plaintiffs in the sale of their 
stock, not one of the plaintiffs was a person ""injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust 
laws"" under section 4.  See id. at 646. The court explained: Whatever of other infirmities the declaration may disclose, we are met at the outset with the utter want of causal relation 
between the alleged injury to plaintiffs and the alleged statutory transgression by any of defendants.  The statute was not 
designed to give to stockholders who have been defrauded in the sale of their stock treble damages for their injuries, nor 
indeed any new or additional remedy for such injury.  If they have been thus defrauded, the law aside from the anti-trust 
statutes affords ample remedy.  The sale of corporate stock holds no different relation toward the statute here invoked than 
would a horse trade, or any other transaction between parties. . . .  We do not understand how a stockholder of an absorbed corporation who parted with his stock for less than its actual 
value can attribute his loss to the substantial lessening of competition or the creation of monopoly through acquirement of 
the corporate stock by a corporate competitor. The competition destroyed or the monopoly created could not injure him in 
his relation as a stockholder of the acquired corporation, since he had parted with his stock. Id. at 645-46. "
273,8, There is no allegation that these noncompete agreements are in themselves unreasonable restraints of trade.  See infra.
273,9," McDonald stayed as an employee of J & J for 2-1/2 years before he voluntarily left and was released from his noncompete 
agreement to buy another pain control company.  Id. at 1319, 1328. The other two plaintiffs finished out the three years as 
employees of J & J, although at the end of that time period, Jensen was fired.  Id. at 1319, 1328-29. "
275,10," For example, the district court, in reciting the facts, observed: Mr. Whitlock admitted at the trial that he told the plaintiffs that Johnson & Johnson had the resources and would put them to 
work for StimTech in an effort to make StimTech ""tops in the pacer business"" and that the Johnson & Johnson name would 
be behind StimTech.  The evidence revealed that the defendant represented that it would furnish substantial research and 
development funds, marketing assistance, administrative assistance, etc., in an effort to promote StimTech and its products 
to the fullest extent."
275,537, F. Supp. at 1352.
275,11," See supra note 10.  Additionally, the evidence revealed that: Within six months of the acquisition, Johnson & Johnson imposed a number of restrictive and suppressive requirements 
upon StimTech, including: The hiring freeze; the imposition of the requirement that research and development be funded 
only out of gross profits; the transfer pricing policy; Devices' acquisition of exclusive distribution rights for StimTech 
products for the United Kingdom and Europe; the humiliation and demotion of Mr. McDonald; the prohibition against using 
the Johnson & Johnson name; the prohibition against expansion of international and domestic business; the prohibition 
against any mini-plants; the direction to cut inventories 40% when StimTech was experiencing shortages of inventories; the 
curtailment of StimTech's programmable pacemaker development; and the prohibition against StimTech displaying its 
products at Johnson & Johnson's annual meeting as other Johnson & Johnson companies were allowed to do."
275,537, F. Supp. at 1352. 
278,12," Plaintiffs' counsel also then instructed the jury that J & J's failure to send letters to the medical profession about the dangers of 
analgesic drugs was a basis for awarding punitive damages: Well, the one that is the most disturbing, at least to me, is the seriousness and the degree of damage that the defendant's 
conduct caused to the general public, because since J & J is the only one in the position, the only drug company in the 
position that has something else [TENS], not only could they send a letter to the doctors, who they have this fantastic 
contact with -- we've been through the trade relations -- but not only would they be able to say, 'Look, the drugs are no 
good for the chronic patient.  They're no good.  Don't use them.  Don't fake these people out or let them believe that these 
pills are going to help them in the slightest' -- not only could they have said that, but in the same letter they could say, ""We 
have the answer."" Tr. 13,167-68.  This argument had nothing to do with the misrepresentation concerning plaintiffs' earnout. "
286,1," On July 29, 1982, defendant Unarco filed a petition for voluntary protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the 
Northern District of Illinois.  All legal proceedings against this defendant remain stayed as a result of Rule 11-44, Bkcy Rules.  A 
motion is pending in that proceeding to vacate or modify the stay, but no decision has at [sic] yet been rendered. Defendant Roblin Industries, Inc. has not joined in the proposed settlement. "
288,2," On August 31, 1983, upon proof that Gleason had paid $62,908.85 for notice to the class members, this Court signed an order

289,3," By motion docketed March 15, 1982 and fully submitted for decision on June 9, 1982, plaintiffs sought access to the transcripts 
of the grand jury testimony of Woodrow W. Smeck, who was Vice President of defendant Unarco until 1977, and Carl W. Viacek, 
who had been President of the Steel & Wire Division of defendant Roblin.  By an order dated September 13, 1982, plaintiffs' 
motion was granted, subject to a protective order. "
295,4," Perhaps Roblin's concern is not as far-fetched as it seems.  On February 2, 1983 Senator Hatch introduced S. 380, a bill 
providing for contribution of damages among conspirators in actions under Sections 4, 4A and 4C of the Clayton Act.  The bill 
was assigned to the Judiciary Committee, and as of this date no further action has been taken on it.  On January 23, 1981, 
during the second session of the 97th Congress, similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives.  Hearings 
on the bill, H. 1242, were held on October 21, 1981.  There is no evidence that this legislation was re-introduced during the 
current Session of Congress.  These proposals are not intended to be retrospective, nor could they be. "

313,1," In Donald B. Rice Tire Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 638 F.2d 15 (4th Cir. 1981), involving a Maryland Michelin dealer, a case 
decided after a full scale trial below, not upon summary judgment or directed verdict, we affirmed the district court's judgment in 
favor of the defendant, Michelin.  Rice, like ITCO here, brought suit after Michelin decided to terminate its authorized dealership. 
We affirmed the judgment in Rice for Michelin on the ground that the district court, as the factfinder, could reasonably conclude 
that, as between Michelin and the party before the court, Rice, the termination was ""for the purpose of promoting interbrand 
competition,"" 638 F.2d at 17, and thus for a purpose not prohibited by the federal antitrust laws."
313,2," In Bostick Oil Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 702 F.2d 1207 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 894, 104 S. Ct. 242, 78 L. Ed. 
2d 232, 52 U.S.L.W. 3291 (1983), we reversed and remanded for further proceedings the trial court's granting of a directed 
verdict for the defendant, Michelin, on the grounds that the circumstances required a full-scale explanation of the facts by trial as 
between Michelin and Bostick Oil Co.  As will become increasingly apparent in the course of this opinion, ITCO's claim in the 
case before us closely parallels, and indeed appears indistinguishable from, Bostick's lawsuit. Bostick, terminated in 
circumstances similar to those presented here, brought suit alleging that Michelin's decision to terminate the dealership 
arrangement was a horizontal restraint prohibited by ยง 1 of the Sherman Act and by the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices 
Act, ยง 39-5-20(a), Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976.  We held: It is ultimately, then a factual issue for the jury to determine whether Bostick was terminated to placate rival dealers 
objecting to price-cutting [by Bostick], or instead for lack of service facilities as Michelin claims. . . .  [A] finding of per se "
314,," violation of ยง 1 would result from a factual determination that the termination was in furtherance of competitors' desires to 
eliminate a price-cutting rival."
314,702," F.2d at 1215. We went on to hold, as well, that Bostick's claim under the South Carolina act necessarily would prevail if the 
Sherman Act claim prevailed: Evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict on the federal causes of action provides at least as sufficient 
a basis for also requiring jury determination of the state law claim. . . .  It is, of course, proper that the jury be instructed not 
to award duplicative damages for violations of both the state and federal statutes based upon precisely the same conduct, 
and the defendant will be free to ask for an instruction to this effect."
314,702, F.2d at 1220.
314,3," On appeal, Michelin advances the argument that the district court resolved this factual dispute, and opted for Michelin's version 
of the story.  The contention mistakes the role of the court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. HN1[
] The court is not 
permitted to resolve genuine issues of material fact on a motion for summary judgment -- even where, as below, both parties 
have filed cross motions for summary judgment. Where genuine issues of material fact are revealed, the duty of the court is to 
deny summary judgment and to permit the case to go to trial.  See, e.g., Smith v. University of North Carolina, 632 F.2d 316, 338 
(4th Cir. 1980). "
315,4," A discount of as much as 10 percent, called the ""quantity shipping allowance,"" was made available on each shipment, the 
exact size of the discount dependent upon the size of the order.  Another discount, termed the ""volume bonus purchase,"" was 
given on the basis of the total annual purchases made by the dealer. That discount, it is said, reached a maximum of five 
percent.  A two percent discount was given to those dealers who paid their bills in cash within a certain period of time.  And there 
was a ""standard dealer discount"" given to every dealer by Michelin.  In 1977, the standard discount was 33.5 percent off of the 
suggested retail price. "
316,5," The matter, it appears, was not explored in the district court.  The record fails to reveal Michelin's principal place of business 
and, thus, it cannot be said with certainty that the parties are of diverse citizenship."
316,6," The TRO was once extended and finally dissolved.  ITCO, the record reveals, withdrew its motion for a preliminary injunction 
that would have supplanted the TRO and extended that order's effects."
316,7," A request for certification of the legal issues presented under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b) was denied by the district court. ITCO's purpose in seeking immediate review of the defeat of its state law claim will become increasingly evident as this 
opinion develops.  Suffice it to say that, under ITCO's understanding of the scope of the North Carolina Unfair Trade 
Practices Act, there is no relief and no legal theory available under the Sherman Act count which would not also be 
available under the state act.  Conversely, however, there might be legal theories to pursue under the state act which the 
Sherman Act would not recognize.  The economics of litigation, along with the not unique desire to go to trial with, as 
ITCO's counsel put it at oral argument, a full quiver of arrows, prompted ITCO's decision to pursue a prompt appeal. "
317,8," As we had occasion to point out in Atlantic Purchasers, Inc. v. Aircraft Sales, Inc., 705 F.2d 712, 715 n.3 (4th Cir. 1983), the 
North Carolina act originally provided that the unfair or deceptive act occur ""in the conduct of any trade or commerce."" The 1977 
deletion of the act's reference to ""trade"" and broadening of the act's scope to cover acts ""in or affecting commerce,"" has been 
held to be a substantive change in the act which should not be applied retroactively.  See United Roasters, Inc. v. Colgate-
Palmolive Co., 485 F. Supp. 1049, 1057 (E.D.N.C. 1980), aff'd, 649 F.2d 985 (4th Cir. 1981). No significance is attached to the statutory amendment by the parties here on appeal, and we are unable to perceive any 
significance pertinent to the matters necessary to our decision."
317,9," We thus necessarily reject Michelin's contention that the federal antitrust laws occupy the field and that North Carolina is 
therefore preempted from making conduct that offends ยง 1 of the Sherman Act violative of its own laws as well.  HN4[
] 
""Nothing in the nearly century-old history of federal antitrust regulation is cited to us to suggest that Congress has manifested a 
clear intent to displace state regulation of unfair trade practices."" Bostick Oil Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 702 F.2d 1207, 1219 (4th 
Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 894, 104 S. Ct. 242, 78 L. Ed. 2d 232, 52 U.S.L.W. 3291 (1983). Similarly lacking in merit is Michelin's suggestion that state regulation of unfair trade practices that touch upon interstate 
commerce is rendered unconstitutional by the negative implications that flow from the Commerce Clause.  ""Not every exercise of 
state power with some impact on interstate commerce is invalid."" Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 640, 102 S. Ct. 2629, 73 
L. Ed. 2d 269 (1982). Absent some reason to believe that the North Carolina act is an attempt directly to regulate interstate 
commerce, and is not an act designed to address primarily local concerns which happens to have an occasional incidental, but 
not excessive, effect upon interstate commerce, we perceive no cause for constitutional concern. "
318,10," That is not to say, of course, that there are not other theories under which ITCO might prevail on its unfair trade practices 
claim.  Indeed, the prohibitory scope of the North Carolina act, as we recently noted in Atlantic Purchasers, Inc. v. Aircraft Sales, 
Inc., 705 F.2d 712, 715-16 (4th Cir. 1983), is potentially quite broad.  See also Note, Consumer Protection and Unfair 
Competition in North Carolina -- The 1969 Legislation, 48 N.C.L.Rev. 896, 908-09 (1970). ""Unfairness"" and ""deceptiveness"" are prohibited.  ""A practice is unfair when it offends established public policy as well as when 
the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers . . . . An act or practice is 
deceptive . . . if it has the capacity or tendency to deceive."" Johnson v. Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co., 300 N.C. 247, 263-
65, 266 S.E.2d 610, 621-22 (1980). ITCO has pressed other theories -- among them, harsh dealing contrary to good faith and unfair competition under the common 
law.  Without in any way opining upon the merit vel non of ITCO's additional theories, we merely note that the presence of a 
single potentially meritorious theory of recovery is enough to compel a reversal of the judgment below and a remand for trial. "
319,11," A comment on the choice of North Carolina law is in order.  Michelin contends that the law of New York, and not the law of 
North Carolina, should apply to the conduct at issue here.  Of chief import to Michelin's argument is a contractual choice of law 
provision in the Dealer Sales Agreement providing: The parties hereto intend this Agreement to be executed as a New York agreement and to be construed in accordance with 
the laws of the State of New York. On the basis of that provision, Michelin maintains that the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act has no application to this 
case. HN6[
] Federal courts, when exercising their diversity or pendent jurisdiction over state law claims, must of course, apply the 
choice of law rules applicable in the forum state.  E.g., Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., 313 U.S. 487, 85 L. Ed. 
1477, 61 S. Ct. 1020 (1941). The district court in this action, then, would be bound to look to the choice of law rules applicable in 
North Carolina's state courts. We are satisfied that North Carolina's courts would apply N.C.Gen.Stat. ยง 75-1.1 to the facts presented here without regard to 
the presence of the contractual choice of law provision.  The nature of the liability allegedly to be imposed by the statute is ex 
delicto, not ex contractu.  No issue of contractual construction, interpretation, or enforceability is raised by this case.  The liability 
alleged is predicated, rather, upon actions separate and distinct from the Dealer Sales Agreement itself. The contractual provision thus set aside, we are left with the recent decision of Lloyd v. Carnation Co., 61 N.C.App. 381, 387, 
301 S.E.2d 414, 418 (1983), wherein the North Carolina Court of Appeals indicated that the law of the state where the injuries 
are sustained should govern.  In Lloyd, plaintiff's claim under ยง 75-1.1 was denied on choice of law grounds, the court holding 
that Virginia law should apply.  The court cited for that proposition the case of Shaw v. Lee, 258 N.C. 609, 129 S.E.2d 288 
(1963), wherein it was observed that HN7[
] ""claimant's right to recover and the amount which may be recovered for personal 
injuries must be determined by the law of the state where the injuries were sustained; if no right of action exists there, the injured 
party has none which can be enforced elsewhere."" Id. 258 N.C. at 610, at 289. Manifestly the injuries sustained by ITCO, a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina, 
were sustained in the state of North Carolina.  Cf.  Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. v. Delta International Corp., 696 F.2d 1062, 1065 
(4th Cir. 1982): ""Since a course of action is considered to arise where damage occurs, . . . [the plaintiff's] location in North 
Carolina establishes the first requirement (that ""the cause of action arose in North Carolina"")."" North Carolina's law on unfair 
trade practices, accordingly, would apply."
319,12," Or, if attention is turned to the defendant in a lawsuit, counterclaims and defenses. "
320,13," See n.10, supra."
320,14," Counsel for ITCO put it this way in the district court: We are in somewhat of an unusual situation because we do feel that the central claim on which we have been conducting 
our discovery and preparing our case for the last four years has now been put beyond us . . . . But, Your Honor, we now face again this practical problem of the possibility of a couple of trials or the impact of an adverse 
decision, either on directed verdict or from the jury in this case on the Section 1. With all of that being considered, I think that the best course for our client, perhaps the best course again for all of the 
parties and the Court, is to put all our eggs in one basket for purposes of this case and the only way I think we can do that 
now, mindful of the economies that we lawyers must work with on this side of the room, is to ask the Court to dismiss 
Counts 1 and 2 from this case so that we might finally have an appealable order from this Court, so that we might then 
proceed to, by hook or crook, get the Fourth Circuit to rule one way or the other on our claims. "
321,15," Michelin places great, but wholly unjustified, reliance upon Nash County Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F.2d 484 (4th 
Cir. 1981). We held in Nash HN9[
] that a consent agreement reached in one lawsuit should be accorded res judicata 
treatment in a subsequent lawsuit alleging, for all intents and purposes, the same claim: The only differences between this action and the earlier action were (1) that this suit was based on the federal antitrust act 
and the earlier suit has based its legal claim on the state antitrust act and (2) the plaintiff in this later suit sought only treble 
damages but no injunctive relief. . . .  The two suits allege the same wrongful act, the same illegal price-fixing conspiracy, 
the same operative facts in support of such conspiracy. The state and federal statutes upon which the two actions are 
based are identical in language except in the requirement of the federal statute, but not of the state statute, of a showing of 
interstate commerce. Id. at 486, 488. The correctness of that holding may be accepted unequivocally.  But unlike the case here, Nash involved two lawsuits -- a first 
and a second suit -- and this raised the very policy concerns which the doctrine of res judicata is geared to address.  Duplicitous 
litigation was presented as an evil to be avoided by application of the doctrine in Nash.  The same evil is to be avoided in this 
case by refusing to apply the doctrine. Indeed, in setting forth the ""essential elements of the doctrine,"" the Nash court listed as two of the requisites: ""(1) a final 
judgment in the merits in an earlier suit, [and] (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit."" Id. at 484 
(emphasis supplied). Stating the formal requirements for applicability of the doctrine of res judicata in that way makes perfect sense, for HN10[
] it is 
only where more than one lawsuit is involved that society's interests in the finality of a judgment and the avoidance of duplicitous 
litigation are implicated. "
323,1," I do not read this language of plaintiff's counsel as supporting the conclusion that the plaintiff ""dismissed its federal claim on the 
understanding that whatever antitrust arguments it might have made under the Sherman Act that also are cognizable under the 
North Carolina Act would remain available in the event of success on appeal and a subsequent trial after remand."" What counsel 
actually said in submitting his motion, as shown in the above quote of his language, was that ""hopefully"" the order for judgment 
of dismissal with prejudice would include ""language that preserves to us the full orbit of Chapter 75 liability which would include 
proof of Section 1 conspiracy. . . ."" I have also quoted the Court's response to this request.  In this response, the Court made it 
plain that, ""I'm not ruling on"" whether ""this dismissal at all has anything to do with the relevancy of any evidence that would have 
been available to you under your Section 1 claim as against a Chapter 75 claim."" That language, it would seem, does not justify 
a finding that there was any ""understanding"" on the effect of the dismissal; there could have been no such understanding in view 
of the District Court's categorical statement that he was ""not ruling on"" that question.  Moreover, when the Court entered its 
formal judgment, it did not include any ""carefully crafted"" language that set forth any such understanding or ruling that included 
""language that preserve[d] to [the plaintiff] the full orbit of Chapter 75 liability . . . ."" Under those circumstances the order of 
judgment granting the motion by the plaintiff to dismiss the federal antitrust action with prejudice gave rise to res judicata. "

services to all Americans at reasonable costs."""

334,5," HN2[
] The full text of ยง 300k-2(b) reads as follows: (b)(1) The Congress finds that the effect of competition on decisions of providers respecting the supply of health services and 
facilities is diminished.  The primary source of the lessening of such effect is the prevailing methods of paying for health services 
by public and private health insurers, particularly for inpatient health services and other institutional health services. As a result, 
there is duplication and excess supply of certain health services and facilities, particularly in the case of inpatient health services. (2) For health services, such as inpatient health services and other institutional health services, for which competition does not 
or will not appropriately allocate supply consistent with health systems plans and State health plans, health systems agencies 
and State health planning and development agencies should in the exercise of their functions under this subchapter take actions 
(where appropriate to advance the purposes of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and access and the other purposes of this 
subchapter) to allocate the supply of such services. (3) For the health services for which competition appropriately allocates supply consistent with health systems plans and State 
health plans, health systems agencies and State health planning and development agencies should in the performance of their 
functions under this subchapter give priority (where appropriate to advance the purposes of quality assurance, cost effectiveness 
and access) to actions which would strengthen the effect of competition on the supply of such services."
334,6," In 1981, the North Carolina General Assembly substantially amended the certificate of need law.  N.C. Gen. Stat. ยงยง 131-175 
to -187 (Supp. 1981).  The amendments, however, do not apply to this case.  Any references to the North Carolina certificate of 
need law will be to the pre-amendment statute unless otherwise indicated.  The 1981 amendments abolish the requirement of a 
certificate of need for the purchase of an existing hospital in the circumstances presented here. "
335,7," The Attorney General, assuming he has standing under the state statute, has elected not to seek review within the state 
system of the adverse administrative determination."
335,8," The NHPRDA does give HSA's, and the members and employees of HSA's and Statewide Health Coordinating Councils 
limited immunity from damages under any federal or state law.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 300l-1(b)(4), 300m-3(d).  The United States as 
amicus curiae argues that these provisions indicate the full extent of Congressional intent to grant antitrust immunity and 
therefore foreclose any finding of implied antitrust immunity. We find this argument unpersuasive. These provisions resemble the general grants of limited immunity given to employees under other federal programs for acts 
done within the scope of their employment.  See, e.g., 40 U.S.C. ยง 489 (granting good faith immunity to federal officers and 
employees involved in the transfer and disposal of government property); 42 U.S.C. ยง 300j-6(a) (granting immunity to federal 
officers, agents, and employees involved in the federal water systems safety program).  The fact that Congress has granted 
health systems agencies and their members limited immunity under the statute for the performance of their duties, we think, is 
no indication that no further immunity may be implied to others not mentioned and not a part of a health system agency. In addition, such a holding, that would foreclose all claims of implied antitrust immunity, would run counter to the Supreme 
Court's language in National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 101 S. 
Ct. 2415 (1981). There, the Court recognized the validity of antitrust immunity claims under the NHPRDA in the proper factual 
context, citing the United States' statement as amicus curiae that ""'there are some activities that must, by implication, be immune 
from antitrust attack if HSA's and State Agencies are to exercise their authorized powers.'"" Id. at 393 n. 18 (quoting the Brief for

N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 131-176(17)(b) (j) (Supp. 1981).  However, as discussed in note 6, supra, this amendment is inapplicable to

immunized, not post-acquisition activities, which, of course, are not immune. For a good current discussion of the requirement of

such a practice.  Uniformity in the amount of gasoline in cars available for rental prevents unnecessary administrative expense

407,32," Chief Judge Seitz reluctantly joins the majority opinion with respect to what may be proved by the admission of coconspirator 
statements.  In United States v. Trowery, 542 F.2d 623 (3d Cir. 1976) (per curiam), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1104, 51 L. Ed. 2d 
555, 97 S. Ct. 1132 (1977), this court held that statements made in furtherance of an uncharged conspiracy may be admissible 
against coconspirators charged with other offenses.  The logic of Trowery compels Chief Judge Seitz to accept the possibility 
that statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy to fix high prices in Japan may be used to establish the existence of a 
conspiracy to fix low prices in the United States, even though the conspiracy to fix low prices could not be established without 
the admission of coconspirator statements.  Bound by precedent to reach this result, Chief Judge Seitz is troubled by a holding 
that seems to him to permit the bootstrap expansion of a conspiracy in circumvention of the Glasser independence requirement.  
Cf.  Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 443, 93 L. Ed. 790, 69 S. Ct. 716 (1948) (statements made in furtherance of an

410,35," Chief Judge Seitz believes that considering extraneous factors when making a trustworthiness determination under Rule 
803(8) would be an abuse of discretion rather than an error of law.  In his view, the abuse of discretion standard includes 
improper application of the factors which show trustworthiness under Rule 803(8)."
410,36," That Act has now been superseded by section 101 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, 19 U.S.C. ยงยง 1673-73i (1982). "
412,37," Chief Judge Seitz does not agree that our review of relevancy rulings is plenary.  Rather, he would review for abuse of 
discretion, citing Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 124-25, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (1974); Gagliardi v. Flint, 564

Chief Judge Seitz relies on Rule 401, which defines relevancy in terms of evidence that has a ""tendency"" to make facts ""more 
probable or less probable."" Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Chief Judge Seitz concludes that these terms admit of a latitude in the district 
court's relevancy determinations that is appropriately reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. "
415,38," Sanyo, Toshiba, Hayakawa (now Sharp), Hitachi, Matsushita and Mitsubishi. "
416,39," Chief Judge Seitz agrees with the district court's alternative holding that the Recommendation Decision is inadmissible under 
Rule 408.  The only document that plaintiffs offer from the Home Electric Appliance Market Stabilization case is the 
Recommendation Decision in which the Home Electric Appliance Market Council acquiesced. Rule 408 excludes evidence of the compromise of a claim if that evidence is offered ""to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim 
or its amount."" Fed. R. Evid. 408.  On the basis of expert testimony, the district court found that in a proceeding before the 
Japanese Fair Trade Commission, the purpose of permitting the accused to acquiesce in a Recommendation Decision ""is to 
obtain early settlement of disputes."" 505 F. Supp. at 1175. Chief Judge Seitz believes that it is the purpose of Rule 408 to 
encourage settlements by shielding the parties to a settlement from liability based on the fact of settlement or on statements 
made in settlement negotiations.  See Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules: Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, 
Senate Report, reprinted in Federal Rules 206 (West 1982) (Note to Rule 408).  Because the Recommendation Decision in the 
Home Electric Appliance Market Stabilization case is evidence of the settlement of a claim against the members of the Home 
Electric Appliance Council, it may not be admitted to prove that the defendant Council members were liable for the acts that the 
Recommendation Decision describes.  See 23 C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 5308, at 240-45 
(1980)."
416,40," Chief Judge Seitz would hold that the Recommendation, the Complaint, and the Draft of Decision from the MEI case are 
sufficiently trustworthy as the products of a governmental investigation to warrant their admission under Rule 803(8)(C) without "
417,," considering the content of the Consent Decision.  Because the Consent Decree is evidence of the settlement claim, Chief Judge 
Seitz would hold the Consent Decree inadmissible under Rule 408.  See supra note 39."
417,41," Because Chief Judge Seitz relies on Rule 408 to exclude the Recommendation Decision from the Home Electric Appliance 
Market Stabilization case, he would also exclude the attachment to the Recommendation Decision. "
418,42," Because he finds the documents in question sufficiently trustworthy as the result of a governmental investigation, see supra n. 
41, Chief Judge Seitz would not reach the question of whether a court may rely on a consent decree in making a determination 
of trustworthiness. Because the parties have not raised the issue, he would also refrain from deciding whether Rule 408 creates 
a privilege that falls within the exception to Rule 104(a). "
419,43," Chief Judge Seitz agrees with the result reached by the majority, but he believes that our review of the reasonable reliance 
determination under Rule 703 is for abuse of discretion rather than for error of law.  In his view, improper application of the law is 
embraced within the abuse of discretion standard.  See Barris v. Bob's Drag Chutes & Safety Equip., Inc., 685 F.2d 94, 101 n.10 
(3d Cir. 1982); Seese v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., 648 F.2d 833, 844-45 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 867, 70 L. Ed. 2d 168, 
102 S. Ct. 330 (1981); United States v. Genser, 582 F.2d 292, 298 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 928, 62 L. Ed. 2d 185, 
100 S. Ct. 269 (1979). Chief Judge Seitz incorporates this footnote by reference to each of the majority's uses of the legal error 
standard when reviewing the district court's exclusion of the DePodwin, Yamamura, Nehmer, Saxonhouse, and Haley reports 
under Rule 703. "
420,44," See, e.g., Committee on the Federal Courts of the New York County Lawyers Assoc. Report (April 1970)."
420,45," Rule 705 provides: The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give his reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the 
underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise.  The expert may in any event be required to disclose the 
underlying facts or data on cross-examination."
420,46," Most of the cases relied upon by the trial court in developing its restrictive approach to admissibility under Rule 703 involved 
weight, not admissibility. See Punnett v. Carter, 621 F.2d 578, 583-86 (3d Cir. 1980) (trial court properly denied preliminary 
injunction despite expert's opinion); Drayton v. Jiffee Chemical Corp., 591 F.2d 352, 362-64 (6th Cir. 1978) (trial court did not err 
in admitting economist's testimony, but gave it undue weight); Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 569 
F.2d 666, 672-73 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (trial court did not err in giving expert's opinion little weight); Scheel v. Conboy, 551 F.2d 41, 
43-44 (4th Cir. 1977) (trial court did not err in giving no weight to economist's testimony on future economic loss).  Of the cases 
relied upon only Berguido v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 317 F.2d 628 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 895, 84 S. Ct. 170, 11 L. Ed. 2d 
124 (1963), addresses admissibility rather than weight.  Berguido did embrace a restrictive approach to admissibility of expert 
opinion based on anything but personal observation or trial testimony.  Id. at 632. It has in that respect been overruled by the 
codification of a different approach in Rule 703.  Pittsburgh Press Club v. United States, 579 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1978), on which 
the court also relied, is not apposite.  It involved an expression of opinion based on a survey offered in evidence, and thus was 
not an interpretation of the second sentence of Rule 703.  Id. at 760. "
422,47, Volume II is a statistical appendix and Volume III is a compilation of damage calculations for NUE. 
424,48," Rule 803(18) provides: Learned treatises. To the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by him 
in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, 
medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other 
expert testimony or by judicial notice [are not excluded by the hearsay rule].  If admitted, the statements may be read into 
evidence but may not be received as exhibits. "
425,49," As with the DePodwin Report the trial court did not rule on admissibility of the sections of the Nehmer Report dealing with 
injury and damage issues.  505 F. Supp. at 1376. "
429,50," Chief Judge Seitz agrees that our review of the district court's preliminary determinations under Rule 803(6) is by the clearly 
erroneous standard.  However, he believes that where the facts are not in dispute, our review in general is for abuse of 
discretion.  E.C. Ernst, Inc. v. Koppers Co., 626 F.2d 324, 331 (3d Cir. 1980); United States v. Bailey, 581 F.2d 341, 346 (3d Cir. 
1978); see also United States v. Flom, 558 F.2d 1179, 1182-83 (5th Cir. 1977). While he reaches the same conclusions on 
admissibility as business records as the majority, he would review the district court's rulings on the business record status of the 
documents discussed in section V E by an abuse of discretion standard wherever the majority uses a legal error or plenary 
standard. "
432,51," Since they are admissible under Rule 803(6) we need not decide whether DSS 48 and 50 qualify under Rule 801(d)(2) or Rule 
804. "
439,52," In considering the former testimony for purposes of summary judgment we will, of course, take into account only so much as 
satisfies Rule 805, which provides: Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms 
with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules. Fed. R. Evid. 805. "
440,53," Chief Judge Seitz would apply the abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the district court's decision to exclude the 
testimony under Rule 804(b)(3). Chief Judge Seitz also observes that the district court's exclusion of this evidence under Rule 804(b)(3) was premised on its 
earlier holding that the rule requires a showing of the declarants' ""subjective understanding of the danger to his interests."" 505 F. 
Supp. at 1259-60 (emphasis in original).  The court therefore rejected plaintiffs' argument that there is an objective or 
""reasonable person"" test for assessing the declarants' beliefs.  Chief Judge Seitz emphasizes that this court is not ruling on the 
validity of the district court's analysis, because the evidence offered by the plaintiffs would be inadmissible under either 
construction.  The district court noted the extreme improbability of the declarants' prosecution for violations of Japanese antitrust 
laws based on statements contained within the diaries, and appellants do not challenge that finding on appeal.  It would not be 
clearly erroneous to conclude that a ""reasonable man"" would not fear for his interests in such circumstances. "
441,54," The district court emphasized that the availability of depositions is an important factor in determining whether the proffered 
hearsay is the most probative evidence on point.  505 F. Supp. at 1264-65. We do not understand the court to have imposed a 
requirement that depositions must be taken in all cases before hearsay can be considered under the residual exceptions.  
Clearly other factors are relevant, including the staleness of the deponent's memory and the cost of taking the deposition. "
443,55," A judgment supported by no evidence on an essential element violates due process.  See, e.g., Vachon v. New Hampshire, 
414 U.S. 478, 38 L. Ed. 2d 666, 94 S. Ct. 664 (1974) (per curiam); Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 4 L. Ed. 2d 654, 80 S. 
Ct. 624 (1960). "
445,56," In Part VI B, infra, we address the separate contention that the Act of State or Sovereign Compulsion Doctrine warrants 
summary judgment. "
446,57," Chief Judge Seitz believes that appellants' evidence would support an inference that appellees had a motive to fix prices in 
Japan because of market conditions and high fixed costs.  This inference, combined with the other evidence discussed in the 
court's opinion, is sufficient to reverse the grant of summary judgment. In his opinion, it is unnecessary to consider whether 
appellants' evidence supports an inference that exports were necessary to maintain this price-fixing conspiracy, or an inference 
that price-cutting in the United States was required in order ""to absorb excess capacity."" "
448,58," As noted earlier at footnote 57, Chief Judge Seitz believes it is unnecessary to consider whether appellants' evidence supports 
an inference that exports of ""excess capacity"" were necessary to maintain appellees' price fixing conspiracy in Japan. "
457,1," The Amended Complaint was originally filed by six plaintiffs.  However, the Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of three 
of those plaintiffs -- Hakubotan, Inc., Jenny's Fashion, Inc., and Para Para, Inc.  -- by a court order dated January 10, 1983, for 
refusal to respond to DFS' First Set of Interrogatories and First Request of Production of Documents dated June 25, 1982. "
460,2," Since this Court has determined that the Territory of Guam cannot be considered a State within the context of the Antitrust 
laws, it will not address the two-prong test applied to independent political subdivisions of a State set forth in California Retail 
Liquor Dealers' Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). i.e., (a) ""the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,"" and (b) ""the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself"". "
466,3," Section 1421b(u) of Title 48 USCA states in pertinent part as follows: ""(u) The following provisions of and amendments to the Constitution of the United States are hereby extended to Guam to 
the extent that they have not been previously extended to that territory and shall have the same force and effect there as in 
the United States or in any State of the United States: article I, section 9, clauses 2 and 3; article IV, section 1 and section

467,4," If there is an interruption or loss of any of the concessionaire's exclusive rights for a period in excess of sixty (60) days, the

472,1," Plaintiff filed its complaint on October 31, 1979, pursuant to the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1 and 2 (count one), the California 
Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยงยง 16600 et seq. and 16720 et seq., and the California Unfair Practices Act, Cal. Bus. & 
Prof. Code ยงยง 17000 et seq.  (count two), and state tort law (intentional interference with prospective business advantage) 
(count three). The gravamen of the complaint was that, commencing in April 1973, defendants conspired with unspecified 
individuals or entities to restrain trade in the exhibition of first-run films in Santa Clara County and to monopolize the relevant 
market through conduct violative of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and certain policies and provisions of state law. Defendants filed their counterclaim on November 26, 1979, for violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 14. Defendants alleged that plaintiff had at all relevant times possessed monopoly power in both 
the indoor and drive-in film exhibition markets in the San Jose zone of Santa Clara County, and that plaintiff used its monopoly 
power and conspired with various distributors and exhibitors to restrain trade and eliminate competitors. "
473,2," HN3[
] These factors consist of the following: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions 
involved; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due 
to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the 
client or the circumstance; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the 
attorneys; (10) the ""undesirability"" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) 
awards in similar cases."
473,3," The rationale underlying this latter principle is twofold. First, the pertinent provision of the Clayton Act requires success on an 
affirmative claim, as a condition precedent to the award of attorney's fees; the provision does not expressly authorize the award 
of fees for services in defense of a claim.  North American Soccer League v. National Football League, 505 F. Supp. 659, 691 
(S.D.N.Y. 1980); 15 U.S.C. ยง 15. In the absence of such express statutory authority, the ""American"" rule of fee awards precludes 
the prevailing party in a suit from recovering a reasonable attorney's fee from the loser.  Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. 
Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141, 95 S. Ct. 1612 (1975). Second, awarding attorneys' fees to successful 
antitrust defendants would defeat the policy considerations reflected in the Clayton Act; the incentive that the prospect of treble 
damages provides for instituting private antitrust actions would be dampened by the threat of assessment of defendant's 
attorney's fees and other costs as a penalty for failure.  Byram Concretanks, Inc. v. Warren Concrete Products Co., 374 F.2d 
649, 651 (3d Cir. 1967); Juneau Square Corp. v. First Western National Bank of Milwaukee, 435 F. Supp. 1307, 1327 (E.D. 
Wisc. 1977). "
474,4," The Court finds that services undertaken only partially in support of the counterclaim nevertheless are fully compensable under 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Such services would have been performed to some extent even if the counterclaim had been filed 
in a separate lawsuit; nothing in the fee award cases suggests that a fee claimant or the Court must determine the precise 
degree to which counsel's services aided in the successful recovery of antitrust damages. A liberal construction of Section 4 is 
consistent with its purpose -- to encourage private enforcement of the antitrust laws -- and with recent Ninth Circuit decisions 
concerning similar divided efforts by prevailing counsel. See, e.g., Twin City Sportservice v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 
1291, 1313 (9th Cir. 1982) (authorizing award of fees for prosecuting both successful and unsuccessful claims to recover 
antitrust damages)."
474,5," The categories into which each firm divided its services are as follows: (1) the Parkinson firm -- court appearances; preparation, 
review, and editing of documents; examination of records; subpoenas/depositions; procedural arrangements; jury; research and 
advice; post trial; (2) the Hackett firm -- discovery; pleadings, summary, document, and memoranda preparation; legal research; 
trial preparation; court appearances; conferences with clients; and (3) the Benjamin firm -- documents; depositions; court 
appearances; conferring with clients and witnesses; conferring with counsel. "
475,6," Defendants refer particularly to claims by Syufy that their president, Stanley Durwood, viewed himself as the ""head gorilla"" in a 
fledgling nationwide theatre cooperative; that Durwood's personal diary was the analogue to Mein Kampf; that defendants were 
engaged in a ""nationwide conspiracy""; that they utilized ""fraudulent"" bidding to obtain monopolistic advantage; that they were 
funded by a ""National Treasury"" located in Kansas City (defendants' principal place of business.)"
475,7," Moreover, under such circumstances, antitrust defendants would file their counterclaims in separate lawsuits in order to avoid 
the risk of incurring their opponent's defense-related attorney's fees. To encourage such a practice would proliferate litigation 
and defeat the ends of judicial economy currently served by the counterclaim device. "
476,8," Thus, had AMC filed its counterclaim in a separate lawsuit (i.e., had there been no complaint to defend), defense counsel 
would not have had to perform the same legal services in order to prevail; Syufy's claims, asserted defensively, would have been 
inadmissible in a separate lawsuit for law of relevance under the Perma Life rule.  Cf. Independence Tube Corp. v. Copperweld 
Corp., 543 F. Supp. 706, 712 (N.D. Ill. 1982) quoted at page 1471, supra. "
478,9," Mr. Parkinson attests at page 5 of his declaration that his firm expended a total of 287.16 hours of service on this case from its 
commencement until August 9, 1982. His time records, however, document a total time expenditure of 333.56 hours for that 
period. The Court has utilized the figure verified in his time records to calculate the lodestar figure. During oral argument, a question was raised as to whether time expended by defense counsel to prepare the instant fee 
application is compensable under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. The Court has determined that such time is compensable. See 
Perkins v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 474 F.2d 549, 554 (9th Cir. 1973); Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., 519 F.2d 527, 
530 (9th Cir. 1975). "
479,10," Mr. Benjamin reduced his customary billing rate to $50 per hour for services undertaken in connection with the instant 
application for attorneys' fees. "
492,1," As Judge Sand observed, 554 F. Supp. at 841 n.2, a claim that the two defendants together attempted to or did monopolize the 
cable television industry, would be one of oligopoly under ยง 1 rather than of monopoly under ยง 2.  American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. 
Delta Communications Corp., 408 F. Supp. 1075, 1106 (S.D. Miss. 1976), aff'd per curiam, 579 F.2d 972 (5 Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 926, 100 S. Ct. 265, 62 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1979). However, he read the complaint as alleging attempted 
monopolization by each defendant separately as well as a conspiracy between them to restrain trade.  Such a reading seems 
permissible; if not, any defect could readily be cured by amendment. "
494,2," By the same token, we do not think it useful to discuss the multitude of decisions in other circuits prior to McCready and 
Associated General, none directly in point, which defendants have cited."
494,3," While the complaint does not expressly allege the latter, defendants' brief concedes that the stations would have a cause of 
action under ยง 4 if defendants had restrained competition by the independent producers in selling directly to them, with attendant 
""increased distribution costs of purchasing 'packaged' programming from HBO and Showtime instead of buying programming "
495,," directly from the producers on a 'stand-alone' basis"".  Brief for Appellants at 24-25.  Any defect in alleging this could readily be 
cured by amendment. "
496,4," This hypothetical also answers defendants' argument, mentioned above, that McCready turned on the fact that, because of the 
willingness of McCready and her class to continue treatment by psychologists without Blue Cross reimbursement, the 
psychologists suffered no injury -- in other words that antitrust defendants stand better where their boycott fails, than where it 
succeeds.  Brief for Appellants at 41-42.  Justice Brennan seems to have contemplated that the boycott in the hypothetical 
succeeded, i.e., the banks ceased making loans to psychologists with consequent injury both to the psychologists from loss of 
borrowing power and to the bank from loss of their business.  Justice Rehnquist, dissenting, agreed that the bank in the 
hypothetical had standing, 102 S. Ct. at 2554 n.7, but predicated this on the impairment of its ability to compete with other 
banks, a basis which the majority evidently did not find convincing."
496,5," Insofar as the dissent rested on the ground that ""if respondent's antitrust claim is that petitioners have engaged in an unlawful 
boycott, it therefore is manifest that respondent is not the boycottee,"" 102 S. Ct. at 2556 n.5, it would be inapplicable here. "
497,6," Emphasizing a statement made by Justice Stevens in distinguishing McCready, ""in this case, however, the Union was neither a 
consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was restrained,"" 103 S. Ct. at 909 (footnote omitted), defendants argue 
that any enlargement of the category of ยง 4 plaintiffs wrought by McCready was limited to consumers and that Crimpers was not 
a consumer. There are two answers: First, although McCready was a consumer, the opinion was not so limited, as witness the 
bank hypothetical in footnote 21 of the Court's opinion discussed above.  Second, Crimpers was ""a competitor in the market in 
which trade was restrained"" in the sense that its trade show would have served to facilitate the direct dealing between producers 
and television stations which defendants sought to prevent. "
502,1," Defendants' memoranda addressed only the antitrust immunity issue.  Therefore, we do not construe the sufficiency of the 
remainder of the complaint. "
504,2," The phrase ""certain conduct"" used by the Court of Appeals must be read in context.  Read too broadly, the phrase could be 
interpreted as approving a ""state action"" exemption where the legislature merely authorized municipalities to act in a certain 
area.  Such a rule, however, would be foreclosed by City of Boulder. The Court of Appeals' statement, though, follows this "
505,," sentence: ""The district court properly focused on determining if authorization for the refusal to provide sewage treatment exists 
rather than attempting to find a specific authorization for the monopolizing effect that results from refusing to provide these 
services."" 700 F.2d at 381, emphasis added.  Therefore, as discussed infra, Town of Hallie stands for the proposition that ""state 
action"" immunity can be found where the legislature has authorized certain anticompetitive conduct, not merely where the 
legislature has authorized ""certain conduct,"" 700 F.2d at 381. Any broader reading of the phrase ""certain conduct"" is not 
supported by the facts of Town of Hallie and would be contrary to City of Boulder. "
507,3," One statute cited by defendants, HN7[
] Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, ยง 11-117-1, is not applicable here because ยง 11-117-2, which 
defines what is a ""public utility"" for purposes of ยง 11-117-1, does not include sewage systems. "
508,4," The Illinois legislature does know how to authorize expressly a governmental unit to attach conditions to its contracts.  See Ill. 
Rev. Stat. ch. 24, ยง 11-117-6, which provides, in relevant part: Any municipality may incorporate in any grant to a public utility company reservation of the right on the part of the 
municipality to take over all or any part of the property, plant, or equipment used in the operation of that public utility 
company, at or before the expiration of the grant, upon such terms and conditions as may be provided in the grant. However, as noted in footnote 3, supra, sewage systems are not among the defined ""public utilities"" to which this provision 
applies. "
509,5," Plaintiffs' memoranda cites additional cases which refute the argument that a municipality's franchise powers give it the right to 
insist on any and all conditions to a franchise. See Plaintiff's Brief on the Issues Raised by the Court, at 10-13. "
510,6," Even this limited authority in a municipality to regulate privately-owned public utilities within their borders has now been 
eliminated.  See P.A. 82-583, 82d General Assembly, 1st Sess. (1981).  However, since the effective date of this repeal falls 
after the events which are the subject of this action, we have not accorded the repeal any weight in considering this motion."
510,7," Even were we to follow Central Iowa Refuse System's more liberal interpretation of City of Boulder, we still would not find the 
requisite legislative intent to permit the displacement of competition in our case.  The most that could be concluded by following 
Central Iowa Refuse System in our case is that the legislature authorized municipalities to restrict competition in the sewage 
treatment field.  That would still not be a sufficient authorization for the acts alleged here, since those acts are not a ""reasonable 
or foreseeable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity,"" Town of Hallie, supra, 700 F.2d at 381, footnote omitted, but 
are considerably more onerous."
510,8," The court notes that counsel on both sides of this case have been especially helpful in the resolution of the issues raised.  
Counsel filed memoranda when the motion was originally filed; argued the motion orally; filed supplemental memoranda 
addressing recently-decided cases; and filed cross memoranda on further issues raised by the court. These papers and 
arguments were unusually helpful and responsive. "
514,1," This is the court's term, a shorthand characterization of plaintiffs' definition of competition between municipalities."
514,2," Defendants also cite Adams v. American Bar Association, 400 F.Supp. 219 (E.D. Pa. 1975), in which a conspiracy to 
monopolize First Amendment rights was alleged.  The Adams case is sufficiently different on the facts to be of little assistance. "
515,3," Plaintiff cites Westborough Mall, Inc. v. City of Cape Girardeau, 693 F.2d 733 (8th Cir. 1982); Mason City Center Associates v. 
City of Mason City, 468 F.Supp. 737 (N.D. Iowa 1979), Otter Tail Power Company v. United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973), but 
these cases present instances in which the city conspired with a private entity which was in competition with plaintiffs, also a 
private entity. The competition being affected was the competition between the private entities to which the city was a co-
conspirator, but the city was not in competition with another public entity."
515,4," The market is being referred to in this manner in light of the conclusion reached in section II above.  It is recognized that 
plaintiffs define the market as ""the market for development in Central Lake County."" "
516,5," Defendants use of the word ""held"" is inaccurate.  Defendants' Reply Memorandum at 17."
516,6," Defendants argue that there is no market in the annexation of territory, but this is an issue of fact which remains to be 
established. "
517,7," The term ""monopoly power"" is defined as the power or ability to fix or control prices in the relevant market or to exclude 
competition, actual or potential, from the relevant market. United States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 571. "
521,1," Although he testified that he interpreted announced wholesale price increases and increases in the suggested price as 
directives to him to correspondingly adjust his prices, he also testified that his carriers could charge whatever price they wanted 
to charge.  However, in what could be analyzed as an admission of violation of the Sherman Act, plaintiff testified that he and his 
carriers had more or less mutually agreed among themselves to keep their prices in line.  Plaintiff's Deposition # 1 at 32-34. This 
agreement arose out of fear of loss of customers to the company if they went up on their price.  Plaintiff's Deposition # 1 at 36. "
525,2," Plaintiff's testimony given in his second deposition ten months later could be read to contradict his earlier testimony.  Plaintiff's 
Deposition # 2 at 107-108.  Nevertheless, the prior admission remains without plaintiff's attempting to qualify it.  The policies 
behind Rule 56 weigh against a party defending against a summary judgment motion by making an issue of his own credibility. "
535,1," The separability clause of the distributor agreement reads as follows: ""22. LEGAL INTERPRETATION "
536,," This Agreement is made in, and will be governed by and construed in all respects according to the laws of the Swiss 
Confederation as if entirely performed therein, and will bind the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of 
both parties.  If it is found that any portion or portions of this Agreement violate in any particular any law of any government 
or governmental unit, division or subdivision having jurisdiction in the premises, and said violation would cause said 
authorities to consider this Agreement as void and without effect regardless of the present election of law, then within that 
political unit, division or subdivision, such portion or portions of this Agreement will be of no force and effect, and this 
Agreement will be treated in any such jurisdiction as if such portion or portions had not been inserted herein."""
536,2," Article XII of the sales procedure agreement reads as follows: ""XII -- STATUS OF DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT The Distributor Agreement remains in full force and effect between CISA and Buyer except that the provisions thereof 
which are in conflict with this Agreement shall be deemed to be in suspense during the term hereof, and to the extent that 
no such conflict exists, MMC hereby agrees not to take any action inconsistent with the provisions of the Distributor 
Agreement not deemed to be in suspense in its relationship with BUYER pursuant to this Agreement."" (Emphasis added.)"
536,3," Although the sales procedure agreement states that it is to be governed by Swiss law, the scope of an arbitration agreement is 
an issue of federal law. See Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Industries, Inc., 514 F.2d 614, 616 (1st Cir. 1975) and authorities cited 
thereat.  In any event, the parties have neither argued nor offered to prove Swiss law, and have not suggested that Swiss 
contract law of general applicability would generate a different result. "
537,4," The Dealers' Act provides that ""notwithstanding the existence in a dealer's contract of a clause reserving to the parties the 
unilateral right to terminate the existing relationship, no principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental 
to the established relationship or refuse to renew said contract on its normal expiration, except for just cause."" 10 L.P.R.A ยง

537,5," Mitsubishi was concerned that additional equipment such as heaters and defoggers would be required in the countries to which 
Soler contemplated transshipment, and that such equipment ""might be installed in an unworkmanlike manner, or might violate 
local motor vehicle laws"".  Letter of Yasuo Goto to Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., September 4, 1981.  As for fuel, Mitsubishi 
feared that the use of leaded or low-octane unleaded fuel commonly available in Latin America would drastically shorten the life 
of its cars and would cause Mitsubishi cars to appear seriously underpowered. "
538,6," The act provides as follows: HN5[

court of the United States in the district in which said manufacturer resides, or is found, or has an agent, without respect to 
the amount in controversy, and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of suit by reason of the failure of 
said automobile manufacturer from and after August 8, 1956 to act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the 
terms or provisions of the franchise, or in terminating, canceling, or not renewing the franchise with said dealer: Provided, 
that in any such suit the manufacturer shall not be barred from asserting in defense of any such action the failure of the

541,9," Justice Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 530-31 n.10, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270, 94 S. 
Ct. 2449 (1974), recapitulates the conference discussion of this hiatus and quotes G. W. Haight, a delegate to the conference, 
representing The International Chamber of Commerce, as speculating that ""courts may under this wording be allowed some 
latitude; they may find an agreement incapable of performance if it offends the law or the public policy of the forum"". (Emphasis 
in opinion.) In other words, it could be argued that an agreement to arbitrate an antitrust dispute would, because it offends public 
policy under V(2)(b), be, ipso facto, ""incapable of performance"" under II(3) and should thus not even be referred to arbitration. 
As our discussion in the text, infra, indicates, we have taken a narrower view of ""incapable of performance"".  We remain 
mystified, however, at the sense of, say, having to refer to arbitration a dispute involving the selling of slaves, knowing that an 
award could never be enforced. "
542,10," Other examples of matters not ""capable of settlement by arbitration"", provided to us by the government, are Audi-NSU Auto 
Union A.G. v. S.A. Adelin Petit & Cie (Cour de Cassation, Belgium) (1979), reported in V Yearbook Commercial Arbitration 257 
(1980) (Belgian law precludes arbitration of disputes arising under a Belgian law on unilateral termination of exclusive 
distributorships); Compagnia Costruzioni v. Piersanti (Corte di Cassazione, Italy) (1979), reported in VI Yearbook Commercial 
Arbitration 229 (1981) (Italian law precludes arbitration of labor disputes). "
543,11," The court simply stated, ""We think that this country's adoption and ratification of the Convention . . . . [provides] strongly 
persuasive evidence of congressional policy consistent with the decision we reach today "".  417 U.S. at 521 n.15. This language 
prompted the following comment by A. Jason Mirabito, The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of "
544,," Foreign Arbitral Awards: The First Four Years, 5 Ga. J. Int'l. & Comp. L. 471, 498 (1975): ""Thus, the Court basically ignored the 
Convention Comment, Greater Certainty in International Transactions Through Choice of Forum?, 69 Am. J. Int'l L. 366, 371 
(1975), observing that in Scherk the Court had not addressed the provisions of private international law and the Convention that 
""permit the courts of one state to refuse to enforce an agreement to arbitrate which is void because contrary to the public policy 
of that state"". "
545,12," We speak here, as we have throughout this opinion, only of the enforcement of a prospective arbitration clause affecting an 
antitrust claim.  We express no opinion on the question whether the parties can agree to arbitrate a specific antitrust claim once 
the dispute has arisen, a practice that some courts have likened to the settlement of a private antitrust suit.  See Cobb v. Lewis, 
488 F.2d at 49; Pitofsky, Arbitration and Antitrust Enforcement, 44 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1072, 1079-80 n.31 (1969); cf.  Wilko v. Swan,

557,1, The Lubbock County Beverage Association has since dissolved and is not a party to this appeal.
557,2," The class originally certified was defined as follows: all retail purchasers of alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, from retail stores located in Lubbock County, Texas, 
owned, operated, or controlled by Defendants herein from March 1967 through December 1974.  A person shall be deemed 
a retail purchaser if such purchase was not made for resale or solely for profit.  A retail purchase includes purchases by a 
private club for its members and case purchases. The class was later narrowed because of the unavailability of data relating to the prices defendants charged for wine and beer; 
the commencement date of the conspiracy was also advanced. Consequently, the class ultimately found by the jury to have 
suffered injury was defined as follows: All persons who purchased retail alcoholic beverages during the period from June 1, 1970 through December 1974 from 
retail stores located in Lubbock County, Texas owned, operated or controlled by any of the defendants: Pinkie's, Inc., 
Cecil's, Inc., Crossed Keys Package Stores, Inc., All Star Company, Bob Grimes, Hubert Odom, and Kenneth Odom.  A 
person is a retail purchaser if such purchase was not for resale or solely for profit. Retail purchases of alcoholic beverages 
include purchases in case lot amounts, including purchases by a private club for its members."

you have so found? ANSWER: ""Yes"" as to each defendant. SPECIAL ISSUE NO. THREE During what period of time, if any, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence the unlawful conspiracy existed, if any you 
have so found? ANSWER: ""From June 1970 to December 1974"" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. FOUR Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the activities of defendants in purchasing and selling alcoholic beverages 
occurred in interstate commerce? ANSWER: ""Defendants' activities were in interstate commerce"" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. FIVE Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the activities of defendants in purchasing and selling alcoholic beverages 
substantially affected interstate commerce? ANSWER: ""Defendants' activities did substantially affect interstate commerce"" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. SIX Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the unlawful combination or conspiracy, if any you have so found, was a 
proximate cause of injury to plaintiff and the class members? ANSWER: ""It was a proximate cause of injury "" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. SEVEN Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff and the class members did not know of the existence of the 
unlawful combination or conspiracy, if any you have so found, prior to November 9, 1972, and could not have discovered the 
existence of such conspiracy by exercise of due diligence prior to such date? ANSWER: ""They did not know of the conspiracy and could not have discovered it by due diligence"" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. EIGHT Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendants fraudulently concealed the existence of the unlawful 
combination or conspiracy, if any you have so found, prior to November 9, 1972? ANSWER: ""The defendants did so conceal the conspiracy"" SPECIAL ISSUE NO. NINE What sum of money, if any, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence would reasonably and fairly compensate plaintiff 
and the members of the class for their damages, if any, in purchasing alcoholic beverages proximately caused by the unlawful 
combination or conspiracy, if any you have so found? ANSWER: ""$ 927,078"" "
559,4, The largest recovery effected by any single member of the plaintiff class was $ 1779.63 with trebling. 
560,5," Loconto, though not an economist, is a principal in a national accounting firm, with substantial experience in the calculation of 
antitrust damages.  The trial court accepted him as an expert. "
561,6," The FBI survey included the prices charged for fifths, quarts, and half-gallons of sixteen popular brands of liquor. These 
products were selected from among the major classes of liquor sold by the defendants (scotch, bourbon, gin, etc.).  For lack of 
more exact information, Loconto inferred that these products were representative of the classes of liquor to which they belong. "
562,7," No recovery was permitted here for alleged overcharges on the sale of beer and wine precisely because no information was 
available in 1976 concerning the prices charged for these products over the course of several prior years. See note 4, supra. 
The district court was correct to exclude wine and beer purchasers from the plaintiff class, because in the absence of any price 
information the proof of damages would almost surely have been unduly speculative.  Story Parchment, 282 U.S. at 563, 51 S.

563,9," This testimony came during cross-examination of defendant Kenneth Odom, one of the owners of Cecil's and Mark's: Q.  With regard to your average discount on cases to consumers, you said 12 to 13 percent.  Would that have been in the 
area of '70 to '75? A.  Up through today. Q.  So, up through today it has been pretty constant, around the same discount level? A.  Yes, sir."
563,10," Because the defendant stores were all located in close proximity to one another and offered comparable services, it appears 
unlikely that consumers would have had any powerful nonprice-related reason to prefer one store to another. "
566,11," These guides are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to 
perform the legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorneys due to acceptance of the case; (5) 
the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the 
amounts involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ""undesirability"" of 
the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. "
567,12," Counsel's suggestion at oral argument that Rule 56 may be a valuable resource for the conduct of phase two proceedings is 
certainly well taken but we decline the suggestion to view this proceeding at phase two as an effort to move for summary

603,12," The rebate agreement does condition the basis on which Cole may compete with Sears, but the only evidence is that this is 
the quid pro quo for the concession inside the Sears store.  While this might give Cole something to complain about, there is no 
evidence that the rebate agreement has had any effect on American Key or other competitors. The only evidence in this case 
which bears upon the intent of Cole and Sears in entering the rebate agreement is the memorandum describing the agreement 
to Sears employees.  See slip op. pages at 9-10, supra. By its terms this memorandum clearly shows that Sears expects 
competition from other keyshops and disclaims any intent to limit such competition. "
617,1," Although Dr. Marrese's state court suit was not actually dismissed until after his federal suit was filed, it appears from the 
record before us that it was effectively defunct before his federal suit was filed.  Once Dr. Treister's suit went to the Illinois 
Appellate Court on appeal, Dr. Marrese's suit, which raised identical issues, was stayed by the circuit court pending Dr. Treister's 
appeal.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the dismissal of Dr. Treister's complaint for failure to state a cause of action in 
October of 1979, and shortly thereafter the Illinois Supreme Court denied Dr. Treister's petition for leave to appeal.  Following 
this denial, on March 21, 1980, both Dr. Marrese and Dr. Treister filed this action in federal court.  I find nothing in the record 
indicating the reason that Dr. Marrese's suit was not dismissed following the dismissal of Dr. Treister's identical suit. In the 
absence of contrary evidence, there is a compelling inference that Dr. Marrese expected that his state suit would be dismissed 
at the time he filed his federal suit. "
618,2," In Kremer, the Court has stated: ""Congress has specifically required all federal courts to give preclusive effect to state-court 
judgments whenever the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged would do so."" Kremer v. Chemical Construction 
Corp., 456 U.S. at 482 (quoting Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 96, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308, 101 S. Ct. 411 (1980)). However, the Court 
has not stated that federal courts must refuse to give preclusive effect to state-court judgments when the courts of the state from 
which the judgments emerged would so refuse. "
619,3," As Judge Cudahy notes, there is some authority in Illinois law for a similarity of evidence test to determine identity of causes of 
action.  However, Illinois courts have explicitly stated that this is only one test that can be employed for this purpose.  See 
LaGrange Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Rock River Corp., 97 Ill. App. 3d 712, 715, 423 N.E.2d 496, 500, 53 Ill. Dec. 
112 (1981); Rotogravure Service, Inc. v. R.W. Borrowdale Co., 77 Ill. App. 3d 518, 525, 395 N.E.2d 1143, 1148, 32 Ill. Dec. 762 
(1978)."
619,4," Professor Currie is correct in suggesting that the sometimes overly technical inquiry into whether two suits involve the same 
cause of action can obfuscate the more fundamental inquiry for purposes of res judicata: whether the suits are related in such a 
way that a final determination in one should bar litigation of the other."
619,5, This principle also has been stated as follows: 
620,," Having been defeated on the merits in one action, a plaintiff sometimes attempts another action seeking the same or 
approximately the same relief but adducing a different substantive law premise or ground.  This does not constitute the 
presentation of a new claim when the new premise or ground is related to the same transaction or series of transactions, 
and accordingly the second action should be held barred. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS, ยง 25 comment d."
620,6," Of course, the requirement that is proposed may appear to be inefficient in a particular case where a plaintiff brings two 
contemporaneous suits and only one proves to be necessary to win a judgment.  However, the same observation can be made 
about the res judicata doctrine generally, since it requires plaintiffs to present all possible theories of recovery when they may 
not all be necessary.  That the res judicata doctrine is thought to promote judicial economy, see Montana v. United States, 440 
U.S. 147, 153, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210, 99 S. Ct. 970 (1979), reflects the belief that in the long run it is more efficient to consolidate 
closely-related matters at an early stage rather than run the risk of litigating each one separately over a long period of time.  This 
belief seems equally relevant to the situation in the instant case.  Moreover, requiring plaintiffs to bring their entire cause of 
action at approximately the same time would seem to promote judicial economy insofar as it creates some incentive for plaintiffs 
in cases such as this to bring their entire cause of action in federal court.  In addition, to the extent that some plaintiffs still may 
wish to split their cause of action, requiring them to split it contemporaneously rather than successively allows for some flexibility 
at the trial level that may reduce the amount of unnecessary litigation.  For example, under certain circumstances an Illinois trial 
judge may dismiss a suit if there is another action between the same parties for the same cause pending in a different court, 
including a federal court.  See 2-619(a)(3) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (Ill. Rev. Stat., 1982, ch. 110, par. 2-619(a)(3)); 
Skolnick v. Martin, 32 Ill. 2d 55, 203 N.E.2d 428 (1964). Similarly, in some situations the federal court may see fit to stay its 
proceedings under a doctrine of abstention.  See 17 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction ยงยง 
4241-4248 (1978). "
621,7," I recognize that a plaintiff may have theories of recovery under state law that are less complex than his or her exclusively 
federal theories.  In such a situation, a plaintiff may still proceed in federal court.  Pendent jurisdiction could allow the plaintiff to 
litigate one or more of the state claims before others if a district judge is satisfied that such priority should be given."
621,8," It is worth emphasizing that this interpretation of the res judicata doctrine is limited to those cases in which one or more of the 
plaintiff's grounds for recovery can be litigated only in federal court, such as cases involving the federal antitrust laws. Where no 
such jurisdictional obstacle exists, it is already well settled that the plaintiff's entire cause of action must be brought 
contemporaneously, and in one court.  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS, ยง 25."
621,9," Although the fact that a plaintiff has actually lost an earlier suit involving the same cause of action should ordinarily be sufficient 
reason to invoke the res judicata doctrine, it is not essential that this occur.  For purposes of applying res judicata, it may well be 
enough that a plaintiff has waited until the early stages of litigation are over in one suit before bringing the other, or that an 
unreasonable period of time has passed between the filing of the first and second suits.  The reasonableness of the plaintiff's 
actions in a particular case should be a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court that is being asked to bar the second 
suit on the basis of the res judicata doctrine. "
623,1," In response to this dissent, Judge Posner's opinion has been revised in an attempt to narrow the reach of its holding on 
discovery of membership files by limiting it to professional associations, and not even all of those.  A narrower holding may be 
some improvement, but the mere statement that the holding is so limited does not make it so. Judge Posner's opinion labels the Academy's confidentiality concerns, ""if not a First Amendment right, at least a First 
Amendment interest."" We now are left in considerable doubt about which associations may qualify as beneficiaries of this first 
amendment protection, and what criteria should be used to distinguish among them.  As a result, we surely will see additional 
problems created. Therefore, the concerns expressed by this dissent remain valid. "
626,2," This is not to say that the trial judge abused his discretion in the manner in which he afforded protection to the Academy.  I 
would affirm his discovery order. I suggest only that, in light of all the judicial discussion of the issue, the trial judge, before again 
attempting to enforce his discovery order, reconsider whether or not he could improve upon his original order after an in camera 
sampling of the files."
626,1," The opinion authored by Judge Posner is a majority opinion on the validity of the discovery order but a plurality opinion with 
respect to the res judicata issue.  Therefore, as the context requires, I shall variously refer to this opinion as the majority or 
plurality opinion."
626,2, See note 5 infra.
626,3," In 1976, the Academy entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, prohibiting the Academy's further 
compilation or publication of ""relative value scales"" for pricing its members' services.  (R. 86, pp. 2-3 and Reference Exhibit).  
The FTC apparently contended that this activity of the Academy constituted a from of price-fixing.  88 F.T.C. 968 (1976). "

known at this early stage of the proceedings.  I do not question the Academy's commitment to superior medical care, 
professional enlightenment and education."
627,6," At oral argument, counsel for the defendants expressly disclaimed any function of professional self-regulation (like peer review) 
for the Academy.  Yet Justice Simon has said that ""the Academy functions largely as an informal accrediting body . . . .  The 
main advantage of membership appears to be the credential, the Academy's endorsement, relied on by others."" 78 Ill. App. 3d at

preclusive effect to state court judgments whenever the courts of the state from which the judgments emerged would do so . . .""). "
629,8," Plaintiffs argue that an Illinois court would not bar a second suit based on the Illinois antitrust laws because Illinois courts 
employ a different test (based on similarity of evidence) to determine identity of causes of action. See Village of Northbrook v. 
County of Cook, 88 Ill. App. 3d 745, 750, 410 N.E.2d 925, 929, 43 Ill. Dec. 792 (1980); Olson v. Olson, 114 Ill. App. 3d 28, 448 
N.E.2d 229, 232, 69 Ill. Dec. 769 (1983); Hilti, Inc. v. Griffith, 68 Ill. App. 3d 528, 532-33, 386 N.E.2d 63, 65, 24 Ill. Dec. 859 
(1978); Rotogravure Serv. v. R.W. Borrowdale Co., 77 Ill. App. 3d 518, 525, 395 N.E.2d 1143, 1148, 32 Ill. Dec. 762 (1978); 
Treister Supplemental Brief at 10-18.  I do not believe it is necessary here to consider the outcome under this similarity of 
evidence theory of such a suit in state court because this determination is not necessary to the conclusion that plaintiffs' federal 
antitrust claim should not be barred in federal court.  I note in passing, however, that in the decision cited by the plurality, 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Eckhardt, 691 F.2d 245 (6th Cir. 1982), the Ohio res judicata law applied by the Sixth Circuit 
involves a test which is close to that suggested by the Sixth Circuit involves a test which is close to that suggested by the 
plaintiffs as appropriate in Illinois: the existence of ""a single or two distinct causes of action for res judicata purposes [is "
630,," determined by] 'whether different proofs are required to sustain the two actions . . . . '"" Id. at 248 (quoting Norwood v. McDonald, 
142 Ohio St. 299, 311, 52 N.E.2d 67, 73 (1943)). Further, if plaintiffs had appended a state antitrust claim to their federal antitrust claim brought in federal court, the federal court 
would evaluate the federal claim under the plurality's new federal rule, while it would have to evaluate the state claim under 
Illinois res judicata law in accordance with the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1652, and the Erie doctrine.  Vestal, Res 
Judicata/Preclusion by Judgment: The Law Applied in Federal Court, 66 MICH. L. REV. 1723, 1728-31 (1968). This analysis 
could then lead to the anomalous result that the federal claim was precluded by the state court judgment but the state claim was 
not."
630,9," See also Schmitt v. Woods, 73 Ill. App. 3d 498, 499, 392 N.E.2d 55, 56, 29 Ill. Dec. 498 (1979); Hilti, Inc. v. Griffith, 68 ILL.

630,10," The plurality says that the plaintiffs ""waited till they had lost their state law suits and only then . . . did they bring suit."" Supra, at 
1152. This is certainly not true of Dr. Marrese, whose state court action was not dismissed until approximately one year after the 
filing of the federal action.  Marrese's Petition for Rehearing at 7.  In the case of either plaintiff, however, it is unclear what aspect 
of judicial economy or fairness to the defendant would have been served by requiring even the simultaneous filing of both 
actions in state and federal courts."
630,11," The plurality opinion refers to the preclusive effect of a prior state court adjudication of an antitrust defense, supra, slip op. at 
5, in arguing that this court should adopt the same rules for an antitrust claim.  Yet, in the decision which the plurality cites, 
Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 222 F.2d 184 (2d Cir. 1955), Judge Learned Hand refused to grant preclusive effect to a 
state court adjudication of such a defense.  Judge Hand wrote: the grant to the district courts of exclusive jurisdiction over the action for treble damages should be taken to imply an 
immunity of their decisions from any prejudgment elsewhere; at least on occasions, like those at bar, where the putative 
estoppel includes the whole nexus of facts that makes up the wrong.  "
631,," Id. at 189. The Lyons decision is usually taken to stand for a principle precisely opposite to that for which the plurality cites it, 
namely, ""that state court determination of a federal antitrust defense in a contract action could not become binding in federal 
antitrust litigation."" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE ยง 4470, at 683 n.23 (1981).  
See also RX Data Corp. v. Department of Social Services, 684 F.2d 192, 196-98 (2d Cir. 1982) (court declined to apply either 
res judicata or collateral estoppel when there was insufficient identity of issues, partly because state court could not have heard 
claim for copyright infringement). The plurality also relies on Justice Holmes' decision in Becher v. Contoure Laboratories, Inc., 279 U.S. 388, 73 L. Ed. 752, 49 S. 
Ct. 356 (1929), as authority for granting preclusive effect to a prior state court proceeding.  In Becher, the federal suit involved a 
claim of patent infringement, while the prior state decision related to a breach of contract claim. Holmes held that the plaintiff was 
estopped to relitigate the state court's findings of fact, even though these facts might be dispositive of the patent claim. Exclusive 
federal jurisdiction over patents did not prevent the state court from determining facts relevant to the dispute before it: A fact is not prevented from being proved in [a state] case in which it is material, by the suggestion that if it is true an 
important patent is void -- and . . . we can see no ground for giving less effect to proof of such a fact than to any other.  Id. at 391-92. It is clear that the holding in Becher was limited to the preclusive effect of findings of fact.  As the Sixth Circuit, in Cream Top 
Creamery v. Dean Milk Co., 383 F.2d 358 (6th Cir. 1967), explained the Becher holding: Thus if the first suit is brought in a State Court, this will not mean necessarily that facts there proven can be contested 
subsequently in a Federal Court action, notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court.  However, the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable in the instant case where there were no findings of fact and no adjudication 
of the case on its merits in the State Court action.  Id. at 362-63. As the court in Cream Top Creamery stated, so in our case -- there have been no findings of fact in the state court.  The plurality 
concedes that the decision in Lyons is restricted to the preclusive effect of prior determinations of facts.  Nonetheless, the 
plurality continues to rely heavily on the holdings in Lyons and Becher to support its argument that nonfactual issues should be 
precluded in the present case.  Yet Lyons even refers to the distinction between individual facts and a group of operative facts 
involving the application of law.  See also Abramson v. Pennwood Investment Corp., 392 F.2d at 762 (complaint based on 
Securities Exchange Act ยง 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 not barred under res judicata by prior state court action based on claim of 
breach of fiduciary duty although plaintiff would be estopped to relitigate facts determined in prior proceeding).  In the case 
before us, there have simply been no findings of fact to estop the plaintiffs in federal court, and the plurality's citations are not on 
point. "
632,12," At least five circuits including this one have expressly adopted the rule that the availability of a state claim does not bar a 
federal suit based on a federal statute over which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. See Hayes v. Solomon, 597 F.2d 
958, 984 (5th Cir. 1979); Kurek v. Pleasure Driveway & Park District of Peoria, 583 F.2d 378, 397 (7th Cir. 1978); Clark v. 
Watchie, 513 F.2d 994, 997 (9th Cir. 1975) cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841, 46 L. Ed. 2d 60, 96 S. Ct. 72 (1975); Abramson v. 
Pennwood Investment Corp., 392 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir. 1968); Cream Top Creamery v. Dean Milk Company, Inc., 383 F.2d 
358, 362-63 (6th Cir. 1967)."
632,13, The Restatement is therefore squarely against the innovations of the plurality and of Judge Flaum in concurrence. 
633,14," ""Settlement of state court litigation has been held to defeat a subsequent federal action if the settlement was intended to apply 
to claims in exclusive federal jurisdiction as well as other claims."" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND 
PROCEDURE ยง 4470, at 688 (1981).  Accord Abramson v. Pennwood Investment Corp., 392 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir. 1968)."
633,15," The plurality writes, supra, at 1156, that ""it is doubtful that [the plaintiffs] had any objective in bringing this suit other than to get 
themselves admitted to membership"" and that therefore, presumably, they did not really expect to receive any monetary 
damages.  Yet the plaintiffs did seek mandatory treble damages in their federal antitrust claim, and this relief is one which in the 
state courts is purely discretionary.  The plurality's speculation as to why the plaintiffs chose to pursue the litigation strategy they 
did is beside the point, especially when we have the uncontroverted fact of their request for treble damages before us now."
633,16," See also Turf Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813, 818 n.1 (9th Cir. 1982) (the Ninth Circuit, in distinguishing Nash, 
stated that Nash does not apply when the antitrust statutes of two jurisdictions are not the same); Hayes v. Solomon, 597 F.2d at 
984 (prior litigation in state court for breach of a lease does not bar subsequent federal antitrust suit primarily because the state 
court ""could not provide the relief sought in the second forum, federal antitrust damages""). "
634,17," One need only consult the state annotations to the Uniform Commercial Code, which, with slight variations, has been enacted 
in identical form in virtually every state.  There are, of course, different interpretations in the different states.  This situation may 
be acceptable and perhaps desirable in the context of commercial litigation under state law and is the best that can be hoped for 
where there is no controlling federal statute.  Here, of course, there is a strongly controlling federal statute and policy. "
635,18," An alternative, of course, is that federal courts might decline, in their discretion, to hear the state claim under United Mine 
Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966). This would certainly not economize judicial 
resources. "
641,1," Defendants also argue that the complaint should be dismissed because (1) Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an antitrust 
injury, or (2) alleged that the antitrust violation which they complain about has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.  
Defendants' first argument must fail under Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Matic, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489 (1976) because 
Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants' actions impaired competition between municipalities to annex luxury developments and 
restricted competition between developers to develop their land at a reduced cost.  Defendants' second argument must also fail.  
Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' conspiracy effectively dissuaded luxury developers from developing areas located in the 
County.  They also allege that such development would have utilized interstate financial markets, supplies and materials shipped 
through interstate commerce.  These allegations are sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.  McLain v. Estate 
Board of New Orleans, 446 U.S. 232 (1980). The fact that McLain was a class action suit does not change this result.  McLain at 
243. Finally, Defendants contend that the Tenth Amendment to the United States Consitution protects them from antitrust liability.  
However, they have not shown that an alleged conspiracy to restrict competition among developers, infra, pp. 2-5, is the type of 
activity traditionally carried on by local governments which the Tenth Amendment protects under National League of Cities v. 
Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 845 (1976)."

645,12," In a similar case, the Eighth Circuit found that a municipality was authorized to contract in an anticompetitive manner with local 
ambulance companies for service within the city limits.  Gold Cross Ambulance and Transfer v. City of Kansas City, 705 F.2d 
1005 (8th Cir. 1983). The ambulance companies in Kansas City challenged a city policy under which a municipal trust contracted 
with a single ambulance company to provide all the services within the city.  However, the court found that the city was immune 
from antitrust liability for this policy because a Missouri statute authorized cities to contract with one or more ambulance 
operators.  The court held that this statute contemplated that cities could also contract with just one in an anticompetitive manner 
under the language ""with one or more."" By comparison, the Ninth Circuit denied a motion to dismiss under the same principles in 
Parks v. Watson, 716 F.2d 646 (9th Cir. 1983). In that case, the city denied a developer's application to vacate specific platted 
city streets unless it agreed to dedicate certain land containing geothermal units.  The developers sued alleging antitrust 
violations.  The Ninth Circuit denied the motion to dismiss because it found that a state statute authorizing public ownership of 
geothermal resources did not expressly authorizie the city to act anticompetitively to achieve such ownership. "

652,2, Issues regarding the Fee Petitions will be separately discussed.
652,3," The State notes that ""the Pima Foundation has made no objection to the Attorney General's time.  'Pima has no quarrel . . . 
with the hard-time data submitted to the plaintiff.  If the lawyers say they put the time in, they put the time in, and that is the end 
of it.'"" It is this type of practice that has caused increasing concern both by the public and the courts as to the amount of attorney 
fees claimed in cases such as this.  It also suggests why awards in other cases must be carefully examined to see if they were 
considered in an adversarial situation. "
661,4," The $1.8 million dollar monthly damage figure Plaintiff seeks to utilize was not developed by Defendants.  Rather, it originated 
with Plaintiff in its Motion filed January 12, 1979 to Vacate or Modify Stay Order of December 27, 1978.  (Document 74, p. 17) 
Maricopa Foundation later referred to Plaintiff's calculation as ""grossly inflated"".  (Document 103, p.6). "

673,2," At first glance, another case upon which plaintiffs rely, Knudsen Corp. v. Nevada State Dairy Commission, 676 F.2d 374 (9th 
Cir.1982), appears more troublesome to defendants' position.  There, the Ninth Circuit upheld a district court's injunction against 
certain Nevada regulations over dairy product pricing.  Under the Nevada scheme, a dairy producer must file lists of wholesale, 
retail, and distributor prices, which do not become effective until seven days after filing.  The filed prices are made public, and 
sales cannot be made below the filed price, or below cost.  The standard of review used in the case was whether the district 
court abused its discretion in enjoining enforcement of the regulations; the Ninth Circuit did not consider the legal issues involved 
de novo.  However, the court seemed to indicate that if the effect of the regulations was to lessen price competition, then they 
could be enjoined.  The impact of this ruling is uncertain.  On the one hand, the court did not say that the effect of the regulations 
was a per se violation of the Sherman Act; rather, a hearing on the merits was required to determine whether in fact the 
regulations had an anticompetitive effect.  (This appears to indicate that, even were Knudsen considered controlling, plaintiffs 
would not be entitled to summary judgment at this time.) On the other hand, the court cited no cases in support of the proposition 
that effect is sufficient, and could not have relied on Rice v. Norman Williams, supra, because Rice was decided after the 
Knudsen decision was handed down.  This fact, plus the fact that the Knudsen court was reviewing on an ""abuse of discretion"" 
standard, and the differences between the regulations at issue there and in the present case, limits the authority of Knudsen for 
purposes of analysis in the present case."
673,3," This distinction is much less tenuous than appears at first glance.  The price posting/post-off rules only require unilateral action 
from a wholesaler, the setting by the wholesaler of his own price, and adherence to that price.  Since all wholesalers must 
adhere to the prices they individually set, there is an element of agreement mandated by the regulations. Standing alone, 
however, it is not an antitrust violation for a number of wholesalers to adhere to their own publicly-known prices.  It is only a "
674,," violation if the wholesalers adhere to their own publically-known prices and do so with knowledge of the prices of the other 
wholesalers and with the agreement of other wholesalers that they will adhere to their prices.  These elements, however, are 
neither mandated nor authorized by the price posting/post-off rules. "
681,1," The district court certified the action for interlocutory appeal.  This court initially granted leave to appeal but later vacated it as

a competitive firm and vertical integration by a monopolist is that monopoly at one stage of the production-distribution 
process may carry with it the power to affect competition in earlier or later stages.  Paschall v. Kansas City Star Co., 695 F.2d 322, 327 n.6 (8th Cir. 1982), citing 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law paras.

683,," Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 853 (6th Cir. 1979) (citations and footnote omitted).  As noted in Byars, id. at n.27, 
the classic ""natural"" monopoly is that possessed by a utility company in a city or the single newspaper in a small town. On 
remand in Byars the district court found that Bluff City's conduct was fair competition and not ""dirty tricks."" Byars v. Bluff City 
News Co., 683 F.2d 981, 983 (6th Cir. 1982) (per curiam)."
683,5," See P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 729.7a, at 197-98 (Supp. 1982): The publisher [may conclude] that his circulation goals are not fully shared by an independent wholesaler [or, in the present 
case, independent distributor].  The latter's profits are entirely a function of [its] wholesale-retail margin and [its] volume, 
while the publisher's profits are a function of both (1) the wholesale price, publication cost, and volume of newspapers sold 
and (2) advertising revenue, which also depends upon circulation volume.  This means that increased circulation volume is 
more valuable to the publisher than to the dealer (unless, of course, the publisher were, unusually, to share [its] advertising 
revenue with the wholesaler).  The implications are two-fold.  The publisher has a greater incentive (1) to assure higher 
quality service to subscribers than an independent distributor and also (2) to eliminate any excess costs or margins at the 
distribution levels.  Moreover, because the distributors do not compete with each other, there is no market pressure on the 
dealers to hold their margins down and service up.  Of course, the publisher might attempt to supervise the dealer's service 
by contract, but precedent condemns the contractual limitation of maximum prices [, citing, Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 
145, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 (1968)]. The publisher may therefore conclude that self-distribution would improve 
service and minimize prices to subscribers.  But cf. Kamerschen, The Economic Effects of Monopoly: A Lawyer's Guide to Antitrust Economics, 27 Mercer L. Rev. 1061 
(1976), reprinted in T. Calvani & J. Siegfried, Economic Analysis and Antitrust Law 20-24 (1979)."
683,6," See generally authorities cited in Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d at 846 n.2. "
685,7," The potential competitor theory, as adopted by the district court, has been labeled an ""internal contradiction"" by at least one 
leading antitrust commentator.  See P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 729.4b5,.7f (Supp. 1982).  Professor Areeda offered four 
major criticisms of the district court's potential competitor theory.  First, the potential competitor theory reflects ""a social 
skepticism about market entry through merger or joint venture and a social preference for internal expansion,"" yet the district 
court used the theory to ""condemn internal expansion."" Id. para. 729.4b5, at 183.  The record evidence in this case, however, 
shows that the proposed delivery agent system is more like an acquisition of another business than it is an internal expansion.  
Under Star Co.'s proposal, former contract carriers will simply sign new contracts.  The contract carriers will continue to use their 
own trucks, personnel, and customer lists.  Only the label and the ability to set retail prices have changed. "
686,," Second, any influence from Star Co.'s potential competition would be illusory if the antitrust laws prevented Star Co. from 
actually entering the market as a self-distributor.  Id. In the abstract, the point is well taken.  However, the district court's 
injunction did not prevent Star Co. from entering the retail market; it only prevented Star Co. from refusing to deal with its retail 
competitors (the independent contract carriers) when it did enter the market.  Thus, the potential for head-to-head retail 
competition between Star Co. and the contract carrier on a particular route would not be diminished by the district court's 
injunction. Third, any actual competition would be ineffective because the cost of distribution for the publisher would be prohibitively high.  
""Soliciting particular subscribers and making widely separated deliveries would appear to involve unusually high distribution 
costs."" Id. n.20.  By contrast, the typical independent contract carrier who actually delivers the newspaper to the home 
subscriber does not compete against the other independent contract carriers. ""Each has a contractual or de facto exclusive 
territory, reflecting apparent economies of scale.  Speaking loosely, one carrier can serve all the houses in a given block more 
cheaply than two carriers can each serve every other house over two blocks."" Id. para. 729.7a, at 197.  However, the extent of 
Star Co.'s initial costs in entering the market should be no greater than the initial costs experienced by the contract carriers who 
expended a great deal of money in purchasing the routes they serve.  Professor Areeda also noted that, given the holding in 
Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 (1968), actual competition might expose the publisher to 
antitrust liability for unlawful maximum resale price maintenance.  However, Star Co. would not be guilty of maximum resale 
price maintenance if it abstained from predatory tactics in competing against the contract carriers. Moreover, the effectiveness of 
Star Co.'s direct competition was felt during the Louisberg Square incident when Star Co. readily entered the retail market 
despite the higher costs and relative inefficiency of limited delivery. Fourth, the district court's order reflected an unfounded concern that the publisher would charge excessive rates.  Id. at 183-84. 
Star Co. already had control over the retail price through its control over the wholesale price charged to the contract carriers. We 
believe that this criticism is more properly directed to the merits of the optimum monopoly price theory.  See discussion infra."

690,1," White v. Hearst Corp., 669 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1982), was brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and failed because 
plaintiffs failed to prove a conspiracy; in Auburn News Co. v. Providence Journal Co., 659 F.2d 273 (1st Cir. 1981), cert. denied,

Hardin v. Houston Chronicle Publishing Co., 572 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir. 1978), involved only a denial of a preliminary injunction; in 
Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 853 (6th Cir. 1980), the Court noted: If the court below does find that Bluff City possesses monopoly power, the record before us suggests that at worst, such 
power was thrust upon Bluff City by the national periodical distributors who, for valid business reasons, chose to deal only 
with it.  This is significant because mere possession of monopoly power is not illegal.  A monopolist which achieves that 
status because of ""a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident,"" United States v. Grinnell Corp., supra, 384 
U.S. at 571, 86 S. Ct. at 1704, cannot be faulted.  Such monopolists are ""tolerated but not cherished"" because of 
""considerations of fairness and the need to preserve proper economic incentives."" Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak

exclusionary manner vis-a-vis rivals or potential rivals, then ยง 2 is violated.  If, after the additional fact-finding ordered on 
remand, the district court finds that Bluff City did in fact possess monopoly power, it must then determine whether Bluff City 
abused this power by refusing to deal with Byars.  [Footnote omitted.];  in Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 910, 97 S. Ct. 2977, 53 L. Ed. 2d

(D. Md. 1979), there was neither a monopoly nor a refusal to deal; and in McGuire v. Times Mirror Co., 405 F. Supp. 57 (C.D.

698,1," Several of plaintiffs' examples were also cloudily remembered in the transcript, while others deal with topics not covered.  Since 
plaintiffs did not know what the transcript held, their examples were necessarily random choices.  As such, the failure of some to

699,2," Minkler has maintained that after early 1972 he was without knowledge of attempted price-fixing because he was no longer 
TMCA's marketing vice-president. Except for two marginal incidents likewise contained in his deposition, Minkler's grand jury 
testimony is consistent with that assertion.  Thus, his grand jury testimony about events beyond early 1972 is probably 
extraneous.  Regardless, given his nonopposition and the near absence of a secrecy factor, the Court will not cut and splice the 
transcript's germane portions.  Minkler's testimony is released in total."
699,3," For example, Connell argues that plaintiffs have not shown that the information sought is available elsewhere through 
discovery. But in its earlier opinion, the Court said: ""[P]laintiffs need not demonstrate that other available statements by Connell and Minkler, who apparently have testified in 
multiple related cases, would not equally fulfill their needs.  HN10[

common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the 
class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."" In addition, Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) requires that HN3[
] ""the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any 
questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and 
efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the 
class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation 
concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of 
concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the 
management of a class action."" "
706,3," Perhaps, plaintiff plans to prove only that defendant companies conspired with Mass. Movers to collaborate on joint rate 
schedules filed with MDPU.  This would avoid having to show agreements within local markets to fix prices.  It is unclear, 
however, how plaintiff would then show injury resulting from the conspiracy, since, absent local conspiracies, movers were free 
to adopt any of the eleven rate tables, or none at all."
706,4," Although carefully drawn subclasses could conceivably alleviate this problem, because plaintiff has produced no evidence of 
appropriate subclasses, I am unable now to address this possibility.  Moreover, even were the class divided into subclasses, it 
appears that individual analysis would still be required to determine impact and damages. "

contract and warranty for the sale of goods; interference with advantageous contractual relations; and declaratory relief.  All of 
these counts were withdrawn, leaving only the issues of monopolization or attempted monopolization, breach of contract and c. 
93A unfair business practice to be decided. "
712,2," In its amended counterclaim, Onan charged that the refusal of Westerbeke to pay for goods sold and delivered, and related 
actions, constituted an unfair business practice in violation of c. 93A.  At the close of the evidence, I granted the motion of the 
defendant-in-counterclaim to dismiss the count pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).  While Westerbeke's tactics and reasons for not 
paying Onan certainly were questionable and not to be encouraged, I could not say, as the trier of fact, that they rose to the level 
of unethical behavior required by the statute.  See Nei v. Burley, 388 Mass. 307, 446 N.E.2d 674 (1983). "
714,3," The three requirements specified in the Hafner letter were: (1) Submit quarterly Onan financial statements for the quarter ending January 31, 1980, and the following three quarters (Table 
II).  This will allow a divisionalization of the Onan and Westerbeke lines. (2) Submit monthly summary of Onan Dealer Sales for the month ending October 31, 1979, and the following five months. (3) Achieve an average monthly order entry rate of $145,000/month for the next six months.  Note that this rate is a compromise 
of Onan's shipment forecasts and is equal to your 79/80 forecast. "

with the plaintiff's expert's projection methods and assumptions. "
720,7," There was testimony from the plaintiff's president that shifting production to manufacture gensets adaptable to the marine 
application would require tens of millions of dollars and five to ten years.  These bald, unsupported statements were not credible

732,4," Defendants' ripeness and constitutional standing arguments lack merit for the reasons discussed in Part III.A. of this opinion.  
Defendants' antitrust standing argument is also unavailing.  Solinger v. A & M Records, 586 F.2d 1304 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 441 U.S. 908, 99 S. Ct. 1999, 60 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1979), makes clear that preparedness to enter the market is a factual 
issue.  Id. at 1309-10. The Solinger court noted that this issue seldom presents a situation appropriate for summary judgment.  
Id. at 1310. On this motion to dismiss, the Court certainly cannot reject plaintiff's allegations that it is prepared to enter the 
market."
732,5," The state action doctrine does not truly ""exempt"" or ""immunize"" conduct from the coverage of the antitrust laws; rather, it rests 
on a construction of the Sherman Act that places certain activities beyond the reach of the statute."

states as follows: While the development and the regulation of cable television is a matter of statewide concern, the Legislature finds and directs 
that the exercise of the police power of the State of California concerning cable television should, except as otherwise directed 
by the Legislature, remain in the cities, counties, or cities and counties; and that the cable television companies and the cities, 
counties, or cities and counties should remain able, subject to the proper limits of that police power, to contract one with the

734,8," The term ""franchise"" includes the plural form ""franchises."" Cal.Gov't Code ยง 13."
734,9," Section 9-506 of the Arizona Revised Statutes contains no similar provision.  Arizona did not affirmatively address the issue of 
municipal CTV regulation with the specificity that has been done here.  This case is thus distinguishable from Catalina 
Cablevision Assoc. v. City of Tucson, No. 82-459, 1984-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P65 789 (D.Ariz. July 2, 1983). "
735,10," It is tempting to distinguish Goldfarb as a case involving no governmental body at all, for the Goldfarb Court concluded that the 
State Bar ""has voluntarily joined in what is essentially a private anticompetitive activity. . . ."" 421 U.S. at 792, 95 S. Ct. at 2015. 
That interpretation, however, was foreclosed in City of Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 411-12 n. 41, 98 S. Ct. at 1136-37 n. 41 (plurality 
opinion of Brennan, J.). "
736,11," We also decline to follow Televents, Inc. v. City of Martinez, No. C-81-2376 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 23, 1981), which held that sections 
53066 and 53066.1 of the California Government Code do not satisfy the first part of the Midcal test. Televents preceded City of 
Boulder and gave the entire state action question only summary consideration."
736,12," The Court stated that ""because we conclude in the present case that Boulder's moratorium ordinance does not satisfy the 
'clear articulation and affirmative expression' criterion, we do not reach the question whether that ordinance must or could satisfy 
the 'active state supervision' test focused upon in Midcal."" City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 51-52 n. 14, 102 S. Ct. at 840-841 n. 14 
(emphasis added)."
736,13," See also City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 71 n. 6, 102 S. Ct. at 851 n.6 (opinion of Rehnquist, J., dissenting). "
737,14," State supervision via authorization clearly does not satisfy the active state supervision requirement where private defendants 
are concerned; otherwise, the second prong of the Midcal test would never have any meaning because the state can always 
change its policy and its authorization. The Court also notes that a non-trivial state supervision requirement may apply to action 
by non-municipal governmental bodies.  After all, the ""active state supervision"" requirement owes its origin to Bates v. State Bar 
of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977), in which the Court immunized the Arizona State Bar's ban on 
lawyer advertising partly because the State Bar rule was ""subject to pointed re-examination by the policymaker -- the Arizona 
Supreme Court -- in enforcement proceedings."" Id. at 362, 97 S. Ct. at 2698. See also Ronwin v. State Bar of Arizona, 686 F.2d 
692, 697 (9th Cir.1981) (dictum), cert. granted sub nom.  Hoover v. Ronwin, 461 U.S. 926, 103 S. Ct. 2084, 77 L. Ed. 2d 296 
(1983)."
737,15," This conclusion applies regardless of whether CTV regulation may be considered a traditional municipal function.  On this 
point the Court notes a possible distinction between cable television and community antenna television. The latter entails the use 
of cable systems to improve reception of ordinary over-the-air television programming.  The former entails the provision of 
programming created for the cable medium.  Although community antenna television has been municipally regulated in 
California for over twenty years, it may be premature to determine whether CTV regulation is a traditional municipal function."
737,16," The Court cannot say, at this time, whether these issues are capable of resolution on a motion for summary judgment.  If the 
defendants so move, the Court will consider a summary judgment motion accompanied by affidavits and other documents 
permitted by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
738,17," It is of no consequence that plaintiff brought this lawsuit rather than participate at all in the RFP process.  This is so for two 
reasons: first, plaintiff objects to the very act of participating in the process rather-than to the prospective denial to plaintiff of a 
CTV franchise; second, plaintiff's First Amendment arguments challenge the RFP process as facially void.  See Lovell v. City of 
Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 452-53, 58 S. Ct. 666, 669, 82 L. Ed. 949 (1938) (""As the ordinance is void on its face, it was not 
necessary for appellant to seek a permit under it."").  On plaintiff's readiness to enter the CTV operating industry, see note 4, 
supra."
738,18," Defendants' assertion of Community Communications Co., Inc. v. City of Boulder, 660 F.2d 1370 (10th Cir.1981), cert. 
dismissed, 456 U.S. 1001, 102 S. Ct. 2287, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1296 (1982) is unavailing as that case concerned only appellate 
ripeness.  Id. at 1377 n. 6. "
739,19," In Black Hills Video Corp. v. FCC, 399 F.2d 65 (8th Cir.1968), the Eighth Circuit applied NBC to uphold certain FCC 
regulations of community antenna television. 399 F.2d at 69. The Court does not consider Black Hills Video to be compelling 
authority.  First, CTV technology may have changed greatly since 1968.  Second, the language employed by the Eighth Circuit in 
Midwest Video, 571 F.2d at 1052-57 casts considerable doubt on the continuing vitality of the constitutional holding of Black Hills 
Video.  See also, Home Box Office, 567 F.2d at 45 n. 80 (disapproving Black Hills Video and questioning other cases applying 
the physical scarcity rationale). "
740,20," The Court cannot accept the defendants' argument that the application of NBC involves no issues of fact.  The Cities argue 
that since the constitutionality of the (permissive) franchising statute, California Government Code section 53066, is not 
challenged, the Court should just assume its constitutionality and then apply only that part of NBC which holds that there is no 
right to a license. The existence of physical scarcity is central to the NBC case, and the Cities cannot avoid that factual issue. "
741,21," HN12[
] California Public Utilities Code section 767.5(b) reads as follows: The Legislature finds and declares that public utilities have dedicated a portion of such support structures to cable 
television corporations for pole attachments in that public utilities have made available, through a course of conduct 
covering many years, surplus space and excess capacity on and in their support structures for use by cable television 
corporations for pole attachments, and that the provision by such public utilities of surplus space and excess capacity for 
such pole attachments is a public utility service delivered by public utilities to cable television corporations. The Legislature further finds and declares that it is in the interests of the people of California for public utilities to continue to 
make available such surplus space and excess capacity for use by cable television corporations. HN13[
] Section 767.5(a) provides, in pertinent part, that (2) ""Support structure"" includes, but is not limited to, a utility pole, anchor, duct, conduit, manhole, or handhole. (3) ""Pole attachment"" means any attachment to surplus space, or use of excess capacity, by a cable television corporation 
for a wire communication system on or in any support structure located on or in any right-of-way or easement owned, 
controlled, or used by a public utility."
741,22," In addition to challenging the franchising process in general, plaintiff challenges specific parts of the Cities' RFP, such as its 
financial requirements and its program and channel requirements, including the local access rules.  To a great extent, the 
propriety of these requirements depends on the degree of First Amendment protection that the Court ultimately finds 
appropriate.  While the program and channel requirements might be invalid as content restrictions even if the Court finds that 
there is no general First Amendment right to a CTV license, the Court declines, at this time, to decide this issue, which is best 
considered as part of a plenary examination of the First Amendment implications of CTV franchising. "
747,1," Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 24 ยง 11-95-1 provides, in pertinent part, that the corporate authorities of every municipality with a population of less than 500,000 may dedicate and set apart for use as 
playgrounds or recreation centers, any land or buildings which are owned or leased by the municipality and are not 
dedicated or devoted to another and inconsistent public use.  Such a municipality, in such manner as provided by law for 
the acquisition of land or buildings for public purposes by the municipality, may acquire or lease land or buildings, or both, 
within or beyond the corporate limits of the municipality, for playgrounds and recreation centers. "
748,2," A conspiracy among competitors to submit collusive, noncompetitive rigged bids, however, would be a per se violation of the 
Sherman Act. United States v. Brighton Bldg. & Maintenance Co., 598 F.2d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 
840, 100 S. Ct. 79-80, 62 L. Ed. 2d 52, 100 S. Ct. 80 (1979). Hoffman's complaint is devoid of any such allegations. "
750,3," See also Metro Cable Co. v. CATV of Rockford, Inc., 516 F.2d 220 (7th Cir. 1975), where the Seventh Circuit held that political 
contributions, as well as agreements by legislators to support anticompetitive legislative actions are not actionable under the 
Sherman Act. Unlike Metro Cable, the present case goes beyond allegations of official persuasion by anticompetitive lobbying."
750,4," The Village also moved to dismiss the prayer for treble damages in Count I of Hoffman's complaint.  Our ruling on its motion to 
dismiss renders unnecessary a decision on this issue. "
754,1," Waldorf has taken a different position In the Instant litigation, of course. The court Is concerned, however, with the actual 
activities of the parties evidencing their Intent, rather than with their self-serving postures during trial. "
757,2," ""Remoteness"" Is one prong of the antitrust standing analysis engaged in by the courts in Section 4 litigation. Over the years, a 
second prong of the standing Issue, the issue of whether plaintiff has suffered ""antitrust injury"", has also developed from a 
recognition of the language of Section 4 and from the policy considerations underlying the antitrust laws. McCready, supra. The 
issue of antitrust injury is addressed subsequently herein. "
758,3," It has been brought to the court's attention that in a recent 6th Circuit decision, South-haven Land Co. v. Malone Hyde, Inc. 
[1983-2 TRADE CASES ยถ 65.564], 715 F. 2d 1079 (C. A. 6, 1983), both ""target area"" and ""direct injury"" analyses were rejected 
in favor of a case-by-case analysis including consideration of the following factors; (1) causal connection between the antitrust 
violation and plaintiff's harm; (2) plaintiff's status in the relevant market and the nature of plaintiff's injury; (2) directness of injury 
and speculative nature of damages; (4) potential for windfall, duplicative recovery or complex damage apportionment: and (5) 
the existence of more direct victims. 715 F. 2d at 1085, citing Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. Cal. State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). Applying this ""new"" analysis, the Court of Appeals held that 
a shopping center landlord did not have standing to sue for alleged concerted efforts by its lessee to destroy the viability of its 
own sublessee's grocery store operation in an attempt to limit the number of grocery store sites available In the area and hence 
to restrain competition. The court used ""target area"" and ""antitrust injury"" analyses in applying the new test and reaching its 
conclusion. The recent case of Assoc. General Contractors, supra, suggests a trend toward abandonment of the direct injury and target area 
tests in favor of a ""totality of the circumstances"" examination. However, ""direct injury"" and ""target area"" analysis appears to still 
be viable even if only as utilized as part of the new ""totality of circumstances"" examination. "
759,4," In applying the second prong of its analysis, the Court determined that plaintiff's injury was ""antitrust injury"", that is either injury 
resultant from the lessening of competition (Brunswick, supra), or, as in McCready, the preliminary damage which would 
ultimately result in a lessening of competition. 73 L. Ed. 2d at 162-164. "

779,16," ""Employer"", as used in the 1974, 1978 and 1981 Wage Agreements, is synonymous with Industry signatory. The 1950 and 
1974 Union Pension Plans administered by the Trustees were incorporated into each of the three Wage Agreements: the 1974 
Wage Agreement (incorporating the 1950 and 1974 plans, effective December 6, 1974); the 1978 Wage Agreement 
(incorporating the 1950 and 1974 plans, as amended March 27, 1978); and the 1981 Wage Agreement (incorporating the 1950 
and 1974 plans, as amended June 7, 1981).  Article I, section A(2) of the 1950 and 1974 Union Pension Plans provides: ""Employer"" means an employer who is signatory to the Wage Agreement or, with respect to prior periods, was signatory to 
the bituminous coal wage agreement then in effect."
779,17," Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the 1950 and 1974 Union Pension Plans, (Article V, Section B(8)), only ""Employer""' were 
permitted to contribute to the Funds: Contributions to the [1950 and 1974] Pension Trust to fund the benefits under this Plan shall be paid solely by the 
Employers in accordance with Article XX [of the Wage Agreement in effect at the time]."
779,18," 29 U.S.C. ยง 185 reads in pertinent part as follows: (c) For the purposes of actions and proceedings by or against labor organizations in the district courts of the United States, 
district courts shall be deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor organization (1) in the district in which such organization 
maintains its principal office, or (2) in any district in which its duly authorized officers or agents are engaged in representing 
or acting for employee members."

exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the Secretary or by a participant, beneficiary, or 
fiduciary.  State courts of competent jurisdiction and district courts of the United States shall have concurrent jurisdiction of 
actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section. (2) Where an action under this subchapter is brought in a district court of the United States, it may be brought in the district 
where the plan is administered, where the breach took place, or where a defendant resides or may be found, and process 
may be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found."
779,20," 29 U.S.C. ยง 1145 reads as follows: Every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the 
terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall, to the extent not inconsistent with law, make such contributions in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement. "
780,21," Since the clause under consideration is identical in all three agreements, we need not distinguish them.  See footnotes ""13"", 
""14"" and ""15"", supra."
780,22," Additionally, we note that Pulltight (C.A. No. 83-0061) in its memorandum in support of its motion for partial summary 
judgment states that although it signed the Wage Agreement of 1978, it is not a member of any multi-employer bargaining group.  
It is Pulltight's argument that it is atypical of the employers involved in this litigation because its business does not involve the 
mining of coal. Instead, Pulltight claims that it operates a coal preparation facility.  Pulltight asserts that because its employees 
mine no coal, the purchased-coal clause cannot ""preserve work"", nor can it serve as a ""union standards"" clause for the same 
reason.  The Trustees counter this by claiming that there is a factual dispute as to whether Pulltight is only a processor.  
However, counsel conceded that it was possible that coal processors who have Union employees would be covered by this 
agreement.  Because the work unit extends beyond any individual employer, the Trustees argue that even if such a company 
were found, that fact would not make the purchased-coal clause ""secondary"" in objective.  However, in light of the holding of this 
Opinion, these arguments need not be addressed."
780,23," At oral argument, counsel for the Trustees, in presenting its contention regarding the cost differentials in purchasing coal from 
non-signatories compared to coal produced by Union members, claimed that the royalty does not impose a penalty on non-
signatories. The basis of this argument is that the royalty serves to equalize the difference between union labor costs and 
nonunion labor costs.  The Trustees claim the royalty serves as an equalizer and not as a penalty, and that it performs the work 
of a ""union standards"" clause. "
781,24," See footnote ""16"", supra."
781,25," Additionally, at oral argument, the Trustees argued that even if a non-signatory were to provide the identical wages and 
benefits offered by the signatory, the costs of these benefits to the non-signatory would still be substantially less than the cost of 
these benefits to the signatories. It is alleged by the Trustees that the Union has been offering substantial pension benefits to 
more than 85,000 retired miners.  The burden of paying for these substantial pensions falls upon an ever-decreasing number of 
employed unionized miners.  Counsel for the Trustees admitted that signatories are paying into the Pension Fund not only for 
their own employees, but also for a large number of pensioners who may never have worked for that signatory. When asked by 
the Court if counsel were stating that the purpose of the clause was to benefit the Union Pension Fund rather than the Union 
employees of Duquesne, counsel responded that the clause was designed to protect the pensions that the Union negotiated for 
Duquesne's employees and, additionally for the employees of all of the companies who are involved in this litigation.  (The Union 
later attempted to qualify this argument of the Trustees by stating that the purpose of the clause was not for the benefit of the 
pensioners.) "
782,26," This clause is considered the predecessor to the purchased-coal clause.  Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U.S. 72, 70 L. Ed. 
2d 833, 102 S. Ct. 851 (1982)."
782,27," The Trustees and the Union argue that Riverton was wrongly decided and should be disregarded by this Court.  The basis of 
their argument is that if the Riverton Court was correct in its analysis of the work preservation issue, a signatory could close its 
own mines and purchase all its coal from another signatory. Therefore there could be no ""union standards"" clause because any 
such clause would not allow a company to ""shut down."" Furthermore, the Trustees argue that the Riverton Court was incorrect 
when it stated that the company could purchase coal from a signatory whose wages and working conditions were substandard. 
According to the Trustees all signatories have the same standards. Finally, the Trustees contend that the Riverton Court found

806,19," In Breen v. Centex, the district court entered summary judgment on the federal claims and subsequently dismissed the state 
claims without prejudice.  On appeal, this Court remanded as it was unclear whether the district court had dismissed the state 
claim for lack of jurisdiction or whether the court dismissed the claim simply as a matter of judicial discretion.  This court held that 
if the dismissal was based on the latter reason, it would be reviewed on appeal under the ""abuse of discretion"" standard, but if 
the district court operated under the former rationale in dismissing the state claim, its decision constituted error.  695 F.2d at 
914. "
807,20," The second portion of Paragraph 8 provided for a five year non-competition period after termination of the Agreement, but only 
if the Agreement was terminated by Transource under Paragraph 11, which allowed termination after the delivery of 700

807,21," If Trinity was obligated to post the Valdunes letter of credit, it could not support its decision to withhold the $20,000 advance 
with the excuse that Transource did not provide the Valdunes purchase order. "

obligations of Transource and, to the best of Transource's knowledge will be the valid and binding obligations of the parties

808,23," While we consider it unusual that Transource would obligate itself to post a $2,070,090 letter of credit when it possessed 
significantly limited financial resources, we also are puzzled by the idea that Trinity would sign an agreement obligating it to post 
such a letter of credit by that same evening. "
809,24," The district court also made findings regarding plaintiff's estoppel and negligence claims.  Since these claims are also based 
on the intent of the parties with respect to the duty to post the letter of credit, however, we leave their resolution to the district

829,2," The Commission stated: ""Section 5 prohibits practices by individual firms which can be shown to have a significant adverse effect on competition by 
promoting price uniformity at supracompetitive levels, although this result is accomplished without evidence of an explicit 
agreement. . . .  Evidence of the actual effect of the facilitating practices is a necessary element prior to any finding of 
liability. . . .  Therefore, facilitating practices by individual firms will be found to violate ยง 5 as unfair methods of competition

832,6," An example was Du Pont's giving of a 30-day notice of a price increase in August 1977 without any additional advance, or 
grace period, notice. When Ethyl thereafter undercut Du Pont's increased by adopting a lesser increase Du Pont rolled back its 
increase to the lesser competitive amount rather than sell at its proposed higher price. "
834,7," Examples of conduct successfully attacked by the FTC as violative of ยง 5 have been a manufacturer's use of its economic 
power over its dealers to coerce them into buying tires, batteries or accessories only from those who paid the manufacturer a

835,8," Two decisions heavily relied on by the Commission, Triangle Conduit & Cable Co. v. FTC, 168 F.2d 175 (7th Cir. 1948), aff'd by 
an equally divided court sub nom., Clayton Mark & Co. v. FTC, 336 U.S. 956, 93 L. Ed. 1110, 69 S. Ct. 888 (1949), and Boise 
Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 637 F.2d 573 (9th Cir. 1980), are not of assistance in resolving the issue before us. In Triangle Conduit 
the FTC had found that the use of a mathematical formula by members of a trade association to compute delivered price 
amounted to both a conspiracy to fix prices and an unfair method of competition in violation of ยง 5.  Upon appeal the Seventh 
Circuit held that the conspiracy had been proved by circumstantial evidence.  168 F.2d at 180. Although it went on to state in 
reliance on FTC v. Cement Institute, supra, that it could not "" 'say the Commission was wrong in concluding that the individual 
use of the basing point method . . . does constitute an unfair method of competition,"" id. at 181, the finding of a conspiracy sheds 
doubt on the significance of the latter statement.  Indeed, a majority of the Commission took the view that Cement Institute and 
Triangle Conduit apply only to ""conspiracy situations."" Interim Report on the Study o9f the Federal Trade Commission Pricing 
Policies, S. Doc. No. 27, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 62-63 (1949).  The Commission's failure thereafter for over 30 years to seek to 
apply ยง 5 to consciously parallel behavior not involving collusion, coercion or restrictive conduct indicates that it believed it has 
no power to curb otherwise legitimate behavior allegedly facilitating conscious price parallelism. See BankAmerica Corp. v. 
United States, 462 U.S. 122, 103 S. Ct. 2266, 76 L. Ed. 2d 456, 51 U.S.L.W. 4685, 4688 (June 8, 1983). Boise Cascade Corp. is at best ambiguous.  There the FTC alleged that plywood manufacturers, acting individually, had adopted 
a freight pricing scheme that lessened competition in the industry.  The pricing scheme, use of a West Coast freight factor for 
determining freight prices from southern shipping points, was alleged to have resulted in an ""artificial"" method of calculating 
freight prices, contributing to pricing uniformity of southern plywood.  The FTC argued that even though there was no agreement, 
there was liability because of the anticompetitive effect.  The Ninth Circuit set aside the FTC order, finding no anticompetitive 
effect.  The FTC in the instant case relies upon the following statement by the court: ""We thus hold that in the absence of evidence of overt agreement to utilize a pricing system to avoid price competition, the 
Commission must demonstrate that the challenged pricing system has actually had the effect of fixing or stabilizing prices.  
Without such effect, a mere showing of parallel action will not establish a section 5 violation."" 637 F.2d at 577 Standing alone, the statement tends to support the Commission's position here, particularly since a finding of price conspiracy 
would obviate the necessity of proving that it had the effect of fixing or stabilizing prices.  But earlier in the same paragraph the 
court stated: "
836,," ""It is important to stress that the weight of the case law and the Commission's own policy statement make it clear that we 
are looking for at least tacit agreement to use a formula which has the effect of fixing prices.  Indeed, none of the delivered 
pricing cases support a finding of a section 5 violation for the bare existence of an industry-wide artificial freight factor.  In 
each case, the system had been utilized, tacitly or overtly, to match prices and avoid price competition."" Id. at 576-77. In view of this statement we cannot place much reliance on Boise Cascade as support for the Commission's position here. "
837,9," Even with the use of the additional advance notice, including the extra day's grace period, Du Pont found that initiating price 
increases was ""fraught with uncertainty."" In 1977 and 1978 when Du Pont announced several price increases, Ethyl did not 
immediately follow but announced a smaller increase, which it used to get additional business.  Du Pont was then forced to 
modify its increase to Ethyl's lower level."
837,10," The requirement is comparable to the principle that there must be a ""plus factor"" before conscious parallelism may be found to 
be conspiratorial in violation of the Sherman Act. See e.g., Naumkeag Theatres Co. v. New England Theatres, Inc., 345 F.2d 
910, 911-12 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 906, 15 L. Ed. 2d 158, 86 S. Ct. 241 (1965) (parallel clearances and run schedules 
by motion picture distributors); Modern Home Inst. Inc. v. Hartford Accident & Indemn. Co., 513 F.2d 102 (2d Cir. 1975) 
(defendant insurers had independent reasons for refusing to buy plaintiff's list of customers).  The ""plus factor"" may be conduct 
that is contrary to the defendants' independent self-interest, Morton Salt Co. v. United States, 235 F.2d 573, 578-79 (10th Cir. 
1956), the presence or absence of a strong motive on a defendants' part to enter an alleged conspiracy, First National Bank of 
Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 286-88, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United

United States v. General Electric Co., et al. [1977-2] Trade Cas. para. 61,659, at 72,715 (E.D. Pa. 1977), for instance, General 
Electric in addition to announcing that it would adhere to its published prices and grant no discounts, adopted a ""price-protection"" 
policy under which, if it offered a discount to a customer, it obligated itself to give the same discount retroactively to all other 
customers who had bought the product within the previous six months, thus voluntarily penalizing itself for price-discounting. "
838,11, Economic Report of the President 227 (1983).
838,12," The Commission conceded that, absent advance notice to customers of price increases, the prices would in any event have 
tended toward uniformity except for special hidden discounts, stating: ""While there is a degree of uncertainty in determining pricing responses even with advance notice, the theory of the 
complaint was not that all uncertainty was removed, only that the environment was changed enough to have a substantial 
effect in promoting anticompetitive price coordination.  While prices would likely have tended toward uniformity (except for 
special hidden discounts) without advance notice, the process of reaching uniformity without advance notice would have 
been fraught with a much higher degree of risk for the initiator of a price increase."" (Emphasis in original). "

to enjoining future agreements to adopt such schemes, but have on occasion enjoined their use as well.  See, e.g., FTC v.

necessarily vague, ยง 5 may be particularly well suited as a remedial tool, as it provides only for prospective equitable relief, not 
for criminal penalties or treble damages.  See P. Areeda and D. Turner, 2 Antitrust Law at 22-23 (1978). "

States Code: . . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud) . . .;"
845,*," * * (3) ""person"" includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property; "
846,," (4) ""enterprise"" includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of 
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity; (5) ""pattern of racketeering activity"" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the 
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after 
the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity[.]"
846,4," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, at the time RICO was passed, provided as follows: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of the 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
846,15, U.S.C. ยง 15. This section was amended in 1980 to include provisions regarding awards of prejudgment interest. 
847,5," These standing requirements have not consistently met with judicial approval, see, e.g., Radovich v. National Football League, 
352 U.S. 445, 454, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456, 77 S. Ct. 390 (1957) (""Court should not add requirements to burden the private litigant 
beyond what is specifically set forth by Congress in those [antitrust] laws"").  But see Hawaii v. Standard Oil Company of 
California, 405 U.S. 251, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972)."
847,6," This is especially true of the criminal provisions of the Sherman Act, see 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1, 2, but it is also true of ยง 1962(c) of 
RICO."
847,7," The Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all of post-September 30, 1981 decisions of a Unit B panel of the former 
Fifth Circuit.  Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., 667 F.2d 33 (11th Cir. 1982). "
848,8," Examples involving legitimate organizations are more easily visualized than those involving corrupt organizations. However, an 
example involving a corrupt organization would be where an organization is able to underprice and thereby harm a competitor by 
stealing raw materials used to fabricate the organization's products."
848,9," This duality is reflected in RICO's title itself: ""Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations."""
848,10," There is no need for the government in a criminal prosecution under ยง 1962(c) to identify which of these purposes are served 
in a given case.  The first purpose is the broader of the two and is presumptively applicable in all cases.  On the other hand, in a 
civil setting where plaintiff must prove injury it is quite important that the relevant purpose be identified so that it may be 
determined, among other things, whether plaintiff's alleged injury falls within the parameters of the social harm sought to be 
addressed by the underlying criminal statute. "
849,11," However, there may be cases where the enterprise is also the ""person"" referred to in ยง 1962.  In these cases a cause of action 
would lie against the enterprise in its capacity as such ""person."" See United States v. Hartley, 678 F.2d 961 (11th Cir. 1982) 
(holding that corporation could simultaneously be the defendant and the enterprise)."
849,12," The court rejects the Bank's argument that ยง 1964(c)'s reference to injury to ""business or property"" reflects congressional 
intent to limit recovery to those who have suffered commercial injury.  The same language in ยง 4 of the Clayton Act has been 
held to cover consumer injuries which in a state law context would be considered injuries to the person.  Reiter v. Sonotone 
Corporation, 442 U.S. 330, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979) (allowing cause of action to consumers who had paid a 
higher price because of defendant's alleged price fixing). "

862,1," Section 3-48-3 HN13[
] provides that a municipality ""may, by ordinance, provide for the collection and disposal of refuse by . . . the municipality."" [Emphasis supplied]. The statute provides further that such refuse collection may be by ""contract[,] or . . . any 
other manner deemed suitable by the municipality."" [Emphasis supplied]. And, ยง 3-48-2 provides that a municipality may, by 
ordinance, acquire and maintain its own refuse disposal areas, and enforce a general system of refuse collection which compels 
the taking of refuse to designated places. "
863,2," HN17[
] The New Mexico Supreme Court has held that ""the authority to enforce a general system under [ยง 3-48-2, NMSA"
863,1978," ], and the authority to establish health measures, is authority for the municipality to place garbage collection and disposal 
exclusively within itself."" City of Hobbs v. Chesport, Ltd., 76 N.M. 609, 612-13, 417 P.2d 210 (1966). "
871,*," The Honorable Spencer M. Williams, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation. "
872,1," Rule 4.3 originally read: Any transfer of an existing franchise to a location within the home territory of any other club shall only be effective if 
approved by a unanimous vote; any other transfer shall only be effective if approved by the affirmative vote of not less than 
three-fourths or 20, whichever is greater, of the member clubs of the League. After its 1978 amendment, Rule 4.3 states: The League shall have exclusive control of the exhibition of football games by member clubs within the home territory of 
each member.  No member club shall have the right to transfer its franchise or playing site to a different city, either within or 
outside its home territory, without prior approval by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the existing member clubs of the 
League. "
873,2," Once in this court, the parties have continued their practice of affirmative lawyering and have filed multiple motions.  The 
motions that have not been resolved up until this point are here discussed. First, the NFL has moved this court for permission to supplement the record on the question of the effect of the stipulation 
entered into by the parties concerning relevant market. We grant the motion and will discuss the effect of the stipulation with the 
merits section, infra. Second, the Raiders agreed to drop its cross-appeal if the judgment of antitrust liability and injunction is affirmed.  As we are 
affirming that judgment, we dismiss the Raiders' cross-appeals, Nos. 82-5665 and 83-5938.  It is unnecessary to address the 
NFL's and Oakland Coliseum's motions on this subject. Finally, the Raiders have moved to dismiss the NFL's and Oakland Coliseum's appeals from the district court's denial of their 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motions.  This motion is granted.  The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider this motion; its denial of "
874,," the motion is not an appealable order.  Smith v. Lujan, 588 F.2d 1304, 1307 (9th Cir. 1979). Also, the district court indicated no 
desire to entertain the motions if this court remanded this case back to it.  Id. The appeals in Nos. 83-5714 and 83-5732 are 
dismissed. "
876,3," On remand in Broadcast Music the Second Circuit did not conclude, as the NFL claims, that rule of reason analysis was 
unnecessary.  It found only that it was unnecessary to balance the pro and anticompetitive effects of the blanket licensing 
arrangement because no anticompetitive effects were proven.  Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. American Society of 
Composers, 620 F.2d 930, 934-935 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 970, 67 L. Ed. 2d 621, 101 S. Ct. 1491 (1981). As will 
be discussed below, that reasoning squares with this circuit's view that a showing of anticompetitive effect is a threshold rule of 
reason consideration.  See Cascade Cabinet Co. v. Western Cabinet & Millwork, Inc., 710 F.2d 1366, 1373 (9th Cir. 1983). "
877,4," One district court case has reached the opposite conclusion in a somewhat similar context.  In San Francisco Seals, Ltd. v. 
National Hockey League, 379 F. Supp. 966 (C.D. Cal. 1974), the court upheld the NHL's right to preclude the Seals' proposed 
move to Vancouver.  The court found both that the NHL is a single entity incapable of conspiring in violation of ยง 1 of the 
Sherman Act and that the denial of the move had no anticompetitive effect.  A recent law review article argues that the court in 
Seals correctly decided the single entity issue.  M. Grauer, Recognition of the National Football League as a Single Entity under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act: Implications of the Consumer Welfare Model, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 1 (1983). Although Seals and this 
article offer persuasive reasons for recognizing the NFL as a single entity, we do not find these reasons so compelling that 
existing precedent can be ignored or that we should grant this association of 28 independent businesses blanket immunity from 
attack under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. The unitary nature of the NFL can be accounted for by analyzing the competitive harms 
and benefits of Rule 4.3 under the rule of reason, without impinging on Congress' authority to decide whether a specific industry 
deserves an exemption from the antitrust laws. See Jefferson County Pharmaceutical v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 74 
L. Ed. 2d 882, 890-91, 103 S. Ct. 1011 (1983); see also United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 606, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. 
Ct. 742 (1941). "
887,1," Indeed, no team could generate any revenue without drawing down upon the goodwill and reputation of the N.F.L. in the largest 
sense, or upon the status of any one scheduled opponent in an immediate sense, so that, in effect, all team revenue is jointly 
produced. "
888,2," See Majority Opinion at slip op. 21-28, and my discussion infra of the inconsistency left unanswered by the majority's 
treatment. "
900,1," On February 7, 1984, this Court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. At that time this Court issued a very brief 
memorandum which stated in summary fashion the reasons for granting plaintiffs' motion.  This Court indicated that a more 
complete and detailed explanation of this Court's ruling would be forthcoming.  The memorandum filed herein this day is the 
memorandum promised.  However, in addition to discussing plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, this memorandum 
addresses the pending motions for referral to the Interstate Commerce Commission and for summary judgment."
900,2," The manner in which the parties developed the record for this motion was poor to say the least.  As stated in this Court's 
Memorandum dated February 7, 1984, the parties stipulated to a record in this case during an in-chambers conference, held on-
the-record, on February 1, 1984.  It was represented that a so-called ""Stipulation of Fact"" existed and had been filed along with 
the parties' pre-trial material.  The file contained a document captioned ""Stipulations"", which had been filed by plaintiffs, and it 
contained the signatures of counsel for MOPAC and KATY only.  It did not contain the signature of any representative of UTU.  It 
was not until February 6, 1984, that this Court received and filed a copy of the ""Stipulations"" with a signature of counsel for UTU 
on it.  However, even this document does not contain the signature of KATY's counsel.  This Court assumes that, given the fact 
that counsel for KATY's signature appears on a copy of this document elsewhere in the file, it is a valid and binding stipulation of 
fact. "
901,3," Paragraphs 1 through 13 of these ""Findings of Fact"" are substantially verbatim portions of the ""Stipulation"" signed by the 
parties.  MOPAC is sometimes referred to as ""MPRR"" or ""MP"" and KATY is sometimes referred to as ""MKT"". "
905,4," This Court declines to express an opinion as to the merits of these claims.  The record on these questions is not adequate to 
make any findings concerning the collateral estoppel or res judicata effect of the ICC proceedings in the case at bar.  The same 
is true of the estoppel and bar claim.  Moreover, this Court's disposition of plaintiffs' other claims herein makes it unnecessary for 
this Court to determine these questions at this time. "
907,5," 45 U.S.C. ยง 152, Seventh, provides: Seventh.  No carrier, its officers, or agents shall change the rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees, as a 
class, as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in section 156 of this title."
907,6," 45 U.S.C. ยง 156, provides: Carriers and representatives of the employees shall give at least thirty days' written notice of an intended (change in 
agreements) affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, and the time and place for the beginning of conference between 
the representatives of the parties interested in such intended changes shall be agreed upon within ten days after the receipt of 
said notice, and said time shall be within the thirty days provided in the notice. In every case where such notice of intended 
change has been given, or conferences are being held with reference thereto, or the services of the Mediation Board have been 
requested by either party, or said Board has proffered its services, rates of pay, rules, or working conditions shall not be altered 
by the carrier until the controversy has been finally acted upon, as required by section 155 of this title, by the Mediation Board, "
908,," unless a period of ten days has elapsed after termination of conferences without request for or proffer of the services of the 
Mediation Board. "
909,7," It may be argued that the analogy between the NRAB jurisdiction over ""minor"" labor disputes and the ICC jurisdiction over labor 
disputes is not perfect as it relates to the NLGA, because the ICA was not ""adopted as a part of a pattern of labor legislation."" 
Chicago River, 353 U.S. at 42. This argument is dealt with in section b, infra."
909,8," UTU argues that ยง 11347, 49 U.S.C. ยง 11347, which provides that "" notwithstanding this subtitle, the arrangements [to impose 
employee protective conditions] may be made by the rail carrier and the authorized representative of its employees,"" authorizes 
MOPAC and UTU to negotiate over the crew selection issue.  However, the crew selection clause in the trackage rights 
agreement is a material term of the agreement which the ICC approved and is not one of the employees protective conditions 
that may be altered by the carrier and the employee representative.  Moreover, the use of the term ""may"" in the provision relied 
upon by UTU suggests that it is permissive rather than mandatory.  Therefore, MOPAC does not have any duty to negotiate with 
UTU under that provision. "
910,9," UTU also relies upon Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago & North Western Railway Co., 362 U.S. 330, 4 L. Ed. 2d 774, 
80 S. Ct. 761 (1960). However, this Court finds Order of Railroad Telegraphers to be inapposite.  There, the Court held that the 
NLGA prevented the district court from enjoining a strike by the Order of Railroad Telegraphers.  The Order of Railroad 
Telegraphers sought to force the carrier to negotiate an amendment to the contract to prevent the dismissal of any employees as 
a result of the carrier's consolidation of several stations.  The case is not apposite, however, because the ICC was not involved 
and had not issued any final orders governing the consolidation. Indeed, the carrier was seeking approval from several state 
agencies.  The Court stated: ""Nothing the union requested would require the railroad to violate any valid law or the valid order of 
any public agency."" Id. at 340. Here, on the other hand, MOPAC would be violating a material term of the ICC's approval of the 
trackage rights agreement if it took any action to require the use of MOPAC employees on KATY trains operating its trackage 
rights. "
911,10," There are two (2) problems with applying Chicago & North Western Railway Co. to this case.  First, UTU's dispute is not 
covered by any of the arbitration provisions imposed by the ICC.  See N & W Conditions Article 1, ยงยง 4, 11.  See also Finding of 
Fact No. 8. Second, that case did not deal with the NLGA question.  Chicago & North Western Railway Co. was a declaratory 
judgment action, rather than an action to obtain injunctive relief from a threatened strike.  See also Chicago & North Western 
Railway Co., 314 F.2d at 433."
911,11," Here, according to the ICC, UTU did not specifically object to the crewing provisions of the trackage rights agreement at any 
time during the approval proceedings.  F.D. No. 30,000 (Sub-No. 18) et al., (October 19, 1983) at 8-12.  See Finding of Fact No. 
23.  See also supra, note 4.  UTU disputes this finding, but it matters not because the question of whether UTU objected to the 
crewing provisions of the trackage rights agreement is not material to this Court's resolution of the NLGA problem. "
914,12," Thus, as to plaintiffs' trackage rights agreement, the effect of the ICC's orders is that the following sentence is inapplicable: Each transaction which will result in a dismissal or displacement of employees or rearrangement of forces, shall provide for 
the selection of forces from all employees involved on basis accepted as appropriate for application in the particular case 
and any assignment of employees made necessary by the transaction shall be made on the basis of an agreement or 
decision under this section 4. N & W Conditions, Article 1, ยง 4 (emphasis added).  See Findings of Fact Nos. 8, 17. "
916,13," The first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 1, ยง 4, provides: At the request of either railroad or representatives of such interested employees, negotiations for the purpose of reaching 
agreement with respect to application of the terms of conditions of [these N & W Conditions] shall commence immediately 
and continue for not more than twenty (20) days from the date of notice. N & W Conditions, Article 1, ยง 4 (emphasis added).  See Findings of Fact Nos. 8, 17. "
920,1," Section 1 provides in relevant part: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is 
declared to be illegal . . . . Section 2 provides: HN2[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a 
corporation, or, if any other person, one hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by 
both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
920,15, U.S.C. ยงยง 1-2. 
921,2," The nominated publications were Micro Waves Product Data Directory, Control Equipment Master, Interference Technology 
Engineers Master, Electronic Buyer Guide, Electronic Industry Telephone Directory, Who's Who in Electronics, Thomas 
Register, I C Master, and Electronic Distributors Master Catalog."
921,3," Cox and UTP primarily based their claim of such a concession by Hayden on the following statement: (h) The words ""catalog-directories for the electronics trade"" as used in paragraph 6 of the Amended Complaint were 
intended to be different from the words "" electronics catalog-directories"" as used in paragraph 7(a) of the Amended 
Complaint.  The purpose of paragraph 6 was to describe the interstate commerce aspect of the defendant Cox's business.  
It was not deemed necessary in such paragraph to describe the relevant market monopolized by the defendants.  Thus, the 
meaning of the words ""catalog-directories for the electronics trade"", as used in paragraph 6, was that the subject matter of 
such publications was of interest to manufacturers, buyers, sellers and users of electronic equipment.  (See answer to 
Interrogatory No. 39.) Advertising in such a broad category of publications is not the market monopolized by the 
defendants.  Such market is described in paragraphs 7 and 7a of the Amended Complaint.  The reference in the latter 
paragraphs to "" electronics catalog-directories"" was to those publications that had the characteristics, and were distributed 
in the manner, described in paragraphs 7 and 7a of such Amended Complaint and in the answer to Interrogatory No. 43(i). The answer to Interrogatory No. 43(i) in pertinent part was: The words ""market for domestic advertising in electronics catalog-directories"" means the market for the purchase, by any 
United States supplier of products and services for the electronic original equipment market (hereinafter ""OEM""), of 
advertising to be incorporated in electronics catalog-directories for distribution, without charge, to a controlled circulation 
purported to consist primarily of electronic design engineers in the United States who collectively specify or purchase 
products and services in all categories of products and services special to the electronic OEM. . . . The words ""electronic catalog-directories"" mean reference books, published annually, designed to permit their economic 
manufacture and board distribution without charge and to be retained in the workplace of the subscriber, and having a 
format that includes: (a) a product directory which purports to be a listing of substantially all United States suppliers of products and services for 
the electronic OEM . . .; (b) advertising which is predominantly of product-data pages and which includes a separate catalog section, commonly 
denominated a ""master"" catalog, consisting of product-data pages alphabetically arranged by categories of products and 
services."
921,4," Two of the publications listed in note 2 supra are owned by Cox; if included in the relevant market, they would increase Cox's 
market share. Three are circulated to a specialized segment of the electronics industry.  Three are directories but not ""catalog 
directories,"" and do not contain as much product information as EEM or Gold Book.  One is a broad-based product data book for 
all manufactured products including some electronics. The point is that precise market analysis would require close examination "
922,," of each of the publications; it is not enough that, as the district court found, ""suppliers of [electronic] products utilize all the 
publications cited (as well as EEM and Gold Book) for the purpose of advertising their products."" 566 F. Supp. at 508."
922,5," It goes without saying that, since Hayden's motion for additional discovery was pending, it is another factor indicating that a 
grant of summary judgment was inappropriate. The trial court did not discuss this issue.  We have, of course, observed in the 
past that HN5[
] summary judgment is inappropriate where one party seeks discovery on a material issue.  Schering Corp. v. Home Insurance Co., 712 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1983). So saying, we do not comment on whether Hayden's request for more 
information from UTP's merger files should have been granted; the trial court should at least have made a finding on the issue. "
923,6," We agree with the appellant that its interrogatory answers, including that quoted at note 3 supra, cannot be construed as a 
concession that if the relevant market is larger than EEM and Gold Book, EEM is not a monopolist.  Hence, Hayden's answers 
cannot be substituted for proof that there was no genuine issue of fact on the question of monopoly power."
923,7," Appellants also note correctly that a party may have monopoly power in a particular market, even though its market share is 
less than 50%.  See, e.g., Broadway Delivery Corp., 651 F.2d at 130. "
924,8," As Judge Werker observed in Jennings Oil Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp.: The conclusion that genuine issues of material fact preclude a finding as to relevant market as a matter of law is not 
unexpected.  It frequently has been observed that ""[a] pronouncement as to market definition is not one of law, but of fact. .

956,71," The specific reason for refusing recognition on public policy grounds may vary.  In foreign judgment cases, enforcement is 
denied because the judgment is predicated on laws repugnant to the domestic forum's conception of decency and justice.  In the 
context of anti-suit injunctions, deference to the foreign proceeding may be denied because of the litigant's unconscionable

956,73," Courts split when identifying those circumstances in which instituting a foreign proceeding constitutes an enjoinable evasion of 
forum law and policy.  The experience of the state courts, where the principle has been more often applied, gives no clear-cut 
rule.  When the primary purpose of the foreign action is to avoid the regulatory effect of the domestic forum's statutes, then an 
injunction is more readily issued.  See, e.g.,  Hoover Realty Co. v. American Inst. of Mktg. Syss., Inc., 24 Mich. App. 12, 179 
N.W.2d 683 (1970);  Sandage v. Studebaker Bros. Mfg. Co., 142 Ind. 148, 41 N.E. 380 (1895). On the other hand, merely 
seeking a remedy not available in the domestic forum may be proper.   Tabor & Co. v. McNall, 30 Ill. App. 3d 593, 333 N.E.2d 
562 (1975);  Lederle v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, 394 S.W.2d 31 (Tex. Civ. App. 1965), vacated on other grounds,  400 
S.W.2d 749 (Texas 1966) (injunction not ordinarily granted merely to prevent the invocation of more favorable law unless an 
actual evasion of the substantive law of the domicile will result).  The standard of ""unfair or unconscionable advantage"" is 
employed by other courts.   Keisker v. Bush, 210 Ky. 718, 276 S.W. 815 (1925). The only guideline which emerges is the necessity of evaluating the merits of each claim in light of the particular equitable 
circumstances surrounding the dual litigation.  It should be clear that the availability of slight advantages in the substantive or

958,81," Comity teaches that the sweep of the injunction should be no broader than necessary to avoid the harm on which the 
injunction is predicated.  No injunction should be entered at all when less intrusive measures would redress the injury caused by 
evasion of the public policies.  Thus, although our counterparts on the United Kingdom courts may disagree, the English 
injunctions against Laker cannot be justified as necessary to prevent Laker's evasion of Britain's important public policy of 
avoiding foreign remedies that could damage British trading interests.  The British injunction is not an anti-suit injunction 
designed to protect their jurisdiction to proceed with the case.  Rather, its only purpose is to destroy the United States District 
Court's jurisdiction. This harsh result is entirely unwarranted.  Even though we do not approve of them, the terms of the British Protection of Trading 
Interest Act authorize post judgment sanctions, repayment of litigation costs and damages, and even repayment of judgments.  
In addition, Laker is subject to criminal sanctions and fines if it violates the Act's prohibitions.  These powerful mechanisms 
appear to be more than adequate to protect whatever British economic interests the Secretary of State determines are adversely 
affected."

the unjust and prejudicial influence of foreign laws; and to refuse its aid to carry into effect any foreign laws, which are 
repugnant to its own interests and polity. It is difficult to conceive, upon what ground a claim can be rested, to give any municipal laws an extraterritorial effect, when 
those laws are prejudicial to the rights of other nations, or their subjects.  It would at once annihilate the sovereignty and 
equality of the nations, which should be called upon to recognize and enforce them; or compel them to desert their own 
proper interest and duty in favor of strangers, who were regardless of both.  A claim, so naked of principle and authority to

not have standing to vindicate the injury.  However, this rule is based on the fact that the direct victim of the injury -- the 
corporation -- is ordinarily capable of protecting the creditors' private interest and the public's general interest in effective 
antitrust enforcement.  P. AREEDA & D. TURNER, II Antitrust Law ยง 336(c) (1982).  As in any derivative action, the case for 
creditor or stockholder standing would be stronger when the corporation could not enforce its own rights.  See, e.g.,  Loeb v.

the United States and the British governments, and that the courts of the respective jurisdictions are in no position to resolve that 
dispute by conceding comity to the decrees of the other.  The comity we are asked to invoke is thus comity for the British 
Executive -- and that is something better left to the American Executive to negotiate.  Conceding comity to the actions of the 
British courts, which were brought about and directed rather specifically by the actions of the British Executive, and whose sole 
purpose is the unilateral subjugation of United States interests to those of Great Britain, would require the American judges to

971,140, Id. at 584.
971,141," Id. at 591.  It is not at all clear to us that the English courts were bound to uphold the Secretary's orders under the reasoning 
relied upon.  We are not informed as to the exact scope of the English courts' authority to review actions of the executive for 
conformity to treaties or other governing law.  Consequently we would never criticize or second guess the decision of the Court 
of Appeals to affirm the Secretary's order.  However, it does not necessarily follow from the obligation of the English court to 
sustain its Executive that the English court must consider that the two British defendants would be unjustly treated in the 
American courts because they were unable to make a proper defense, since their production of documents has been by the 
British Executive order, not by any American act.  If, because of their handicap in proof, these two defendants ultimately were to 
be unjustly treated in the American courts, then the complaint of injustice should be frankly made by the British court to its own 
Executive, which is solely responsible for creating the British defendants' disability.  Although it sustained the validity of the order 
and directions issued by the British Executive, the court was free to point out that the problem of the two British defendants 
arose because of the act of the British Executive in denying them access to their defensive proof, not because of any violation of 
due process or injustice created by this particular American court or the American court system.  Nor should it be presumed that 
the American court would be oblivious to the handicap imposed on the British defendants, if such exists, or powerless to take 
procedural steps to equalize matters. Neither is it immediately apparent why the English injunction is necessary to protect the British defendants from suffering 
injustice in the United States courts.  The orders apparently apply equally to Laker, preventing it from furnishing documents in 
the United Kingdom or any commercial information relating to the district court proceedings.  As the Secretary of State's refusal 
to permit Laker to use commercial information in response to interrogatories served by the American defendants demonstrates, 
Laker is severely hampered in the advancement of its claims.  The British parties appear to be on an equal footing. If there is any injustice created in the proceedings, it is between Laker and the American defendants.  The order and directions 
have been interpreted to bar only Laker's production of documents and commercial information -- the United States airlines are "
972,," untouched.  These defendants are free to assert defenses, make discovery requests against Laker, and seek penalties for non-
compliance.  Laker responds only at the risk of incurring British sanctions under the order and directions.  The order and 
directions thus leave one group of parties -- the American defendants -- free to conduct their litigation -- while hampering the 
other party -- the plaintiff.  See also Reply of Amici Curiae to Appellee's Memorandum as to Status of English Proceedings at 4: 
""Lufthansa and Swissair are advised, however, that the Directions do prevent U.K. nationals [e.g. Laker] . . . from complying with 
discovery demands by parties to the U.S. action (including Lufthansa and Swissair)."" (emphasis added).  This is an impairment 
to justice as objectionable as that complained of by the Court of Appeal. We also note that the Court of Appeal may have temporarily lapsed from its resolve not to speculate about the merits of Laker's 
antitrust claims under United States law when, to justify its conclusion that Laker's entire claim arose out of conduct related to 
the Bermuda II Treaty, the court concluded that the alleged impedance of the financial rescue operation was such an 
insignificant aspect of the alleged conspiracy that this assertion alone could not state a cognizable antitrust claim.  Court of 
Appeal Judgment at 589, supra note 15.  We raise these points not to suggest that the Court of Appeal's decision was wrongly 
decided under English law, but only to demonstrate the extreme degree of deference which that court felt obliged to grant to the 
legislative policies implemented in the Secretary of State's order and directions."

976,169," An interest evaluation conducted through the balancing of competing interests can only function as an effective method of 
choosing between potential forums to the extent the less reasonable assertion is characterized as ""unreasonable."" Thus, Section 
403(2) of the RESTATEMENT (REVISED) (Tentative Draft No. 2) appears to deny the existence or even the theoretical 
necessity of concurrent prescriptive jurisdiction. However, read narrowly, Section 403 does not require this result. The terms of Section 403(1) suggest that an evaluation of 
interests is essential in determining whether there are sufficient (""reasonable"") national contacts with the underlying transaction 
to allocate prescriptive jurisdiction to a forum.  This examination of the reasonableness of the domestic forum's contacts, without 
explicitly balancing the weight of other foreign contracts, satisfies the prohibition of international law against unreasonable 
assertions of prescriptive jurisdiction.  See also RESTATEMENT (REVISED) ยง 441 (Tentative Draft No. 2), supra note 21 
(defining jurisdiction to adjudicate on the basis of reasonableness without referring to or balancing the reasonableness of a 
second forum's adjudicatory contacts). Because Congress and the Executive can neither anticipate nor resolve all conflicts with foreign prescriptive jurisdiction, they 
legitimately expect the full participation of the Judiciary in minimizing conflicts of jurisdiction.  See ""Extraterritoriality and Conflicts 
of Jurisdiction,"" U.S. Department of State Current Policy Bulletin No. 481 at 4 (15 April 1983).  Evaluating the strength of the 
United States interests in a particular transaction to determine the reasonableness of an assertion of jurisdiction is consistent 
with those expectations and assures that concurrent jurisdiction will never be lightly assumed."

agreement, dislocating the application of the antitrust laws from the conduct challenged in Laker's complaint.  However, since a 
dispute exists between the two governments, we can only assume that the United States Executive Branch does not interpret

977,173," It may be that a rule of law should be developed allocating exclusive prescriptive jurisdiction to the forum with the most 
significant nexus to the underlying conduct.  Given the inherent difficulty of administering an interest balancing formula, it is 
doubtful that a rule of exclusive jurisdiction based on a common conception of reasonableness will be developed by national 
courts.  The current litigation underscores this point: in the decades since the United States began applying its antitrust laws to 
overseas conduct substantially affecting its territorial interests, neither the United States' nor United Kingdom's courts have 
accepted the other courts' definition of the legitimate scope of prescriptive jurisdiction in the antitrust area.  It is to be hoped that 
the political branches of government will eventually negotiate practical solutions, such as those undergirding the area of 
international taxation, which, through their reciprocal ordering of national regulation, render academic the issue of whether a 
country would otherwise have the sovereign right to exert its authority in a particular manner."

LEECH, THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM 22 (1981). "
978,175," We disagree with the dissenting opinion precisely because it comes to rest at this untenable position.  The ""dissent"" actually 
agrees with much of this opinion: it recognizes the legitimacy of the jurisdictional base to Laker's suit; it confirms the authority of 
the district court to issue a protective injunction; and it would not preclude the district court from issuing a more limited injunction 
on remand.  It is only the ""form"" of the injunction drafted by the district court which the dissent finds so objectionable that 
reversal is advocated. The dissent reaches this conclusion under the guise of ""comity."" However, the legal basis for this interpretation of comity is 
nonexistent.  See supra pp. 942-944. Comity would be a more significant factor if the two appealing parties were British 
corporations, but they are not.  KLM and Sabena are Dutch and Belgian entities.  They are attempting to use the law and courts 
of a third country, Britain, to frustrate a previously commenced action in the United States.  KLM and Sabena have made no 
request to resort to their own courts in reliance on their own air service agreements or relevant domestic legislation (e.g., Law of 
27 March 1969, as Amended on 21 June 1976, and Royal Decree of 6 February 1979 Concerning the Regulation of Marine and 
Air Transport, at Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arretes, 1969, No. 723; id., 10 September 1976, No. 1490, id., 1979, No. 464).  We 
can only assume that they do not intend to do so. The real motivation for the dissent's position is the desire to avoid further conflict with the laws of our close friends and allies 
about the application of domestic United States law.  This is apparent from the dissent's concern that an affirmance of the 
injunction would be regarded as ""parochial,"" and from its charge that the injunction obstructs the functioning of our two countries' 
judicial system. We share the same concerns.  However, a reversal would not restore the ""orderly operation"" of our two nation's courts.  Instead, 
it could permit one court entirely to shut down its autonomous sister courts.  This certainly does not seem likely to foster parallel 
respect. Moreover, the existence of conflict alone does not establish the judicial perogative to relinquish prescriptive jurisdiction.  Any 
legitimate assertion of prescriptive jurisdiction seeks to advance the national interests undergirding the jurisdiction; an assertion 
of that prescriptive power in an area of concurrent jurisdiction may give rise to allegations of parochialism.  Protecting the 
prescriptive jurisdiction of the United States, which the dissent admits is legitimate, can hardly be more ""parochial"" than the 
British attempts to destroy that jurisdiction by knowingly issuing interdictory prohibitions and orders, worldwide in scope, after the 
United States District Court was fully seized of jurisdiction and well on its way in the treatment of Laker's antitrust suit. Finally, we must remember that it is American statutory law which is challenged, not law made by the courts.  These antitrust 
laws date back nearly one hundred years, when Congress began legislating to advance competition and consumer well-being in 
the United States.  Up to now, the courts and the Executive have had no choice but to follow the mandate of Congress.  Critics 
concerned with parochialism should direct those attacks to that Branch, not to the Judiciary. "
979,176," See, Maier, Interest Balancing and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction,  31 AM. J. COMP. L. 579, 584-85 (1983). Although this 
process may always be necessary on an ad hoc basis in response to specific suits, anticipatory arrangements could go far in 
avoiding the problems we are confronted with today.  E.g., Agreement Relating to Cooperation on Antitrust Matters, U.S.-
Australia, 29 June 1982, T.I.A.S. No. 10365, reprinted at  43 Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA), No. 1071, at 36 (1 July 1982)."

the litigation and counterlitigation now pressed in the United States and United Kingdom, apparently neither government has yet 
invoked its right to call for an arbitrated resolution of the scope of the Bermuda II Treaty's immunization from United States 
antitrust laws. It may be that further efforts by the governments of both countries could help resolve the deadlock which appears 
to be developing to the detriment of the litigants' interests and the ultimate frustration of the national policies of the United States 
and Great Britain."
979,178," If the United States Executive interpreted the Bermuda II Treaty to waive both the obligation of United Kingdom air carriers to 
comply with antitrust laws, and the right of those carriers to rely on the protection of those laws, then Laker's claim against the 
foreign airlines would probably fail.  Of course, if only the British airlines' duty of compliance were ceded by the treaty, then 
nothing would prevent Laker from continuing its suit against KLM and Sabena. "

noted that the relief would ""in no way interfere with"" defendant's foreign patent infringement and validity actions in foreign courts."

Court is required or appropriate in light of the decisions of the English authorities. . . ."" Judge Greene suggested, among other

989,2," Rockwool also contends that the district court improperly instructed the jury on Rockwool's claim that its lower prices to 
Williams were made in good faith to meet competition within the meaning of section 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended.  
Rockwool alternatively argues that the court should have sustained this defense as a matter of law. Rockwool further contends that Black Gold failed to prove the fact of injury from the alleged discrimination so as to be entitled to 
damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act. Rockwool claims that the district court's instructions on calculating damages in 
effect allowed Black Gold to recover without making the requisite showing.  Rockwool also argues that even if the fact of injury 
had been shown, the amount of damages awarded was speculative and without support in the record.  Given our disposition of 
the price discrimination claims, we do not address these contentions on appeal. HN1[
] "
990,3," We recognize that the lower profits obtained by Black Gold within the PSC program might have detrimentally affected its ability 
to compete outside the program.  However, Black Gold did not raise this argument on appeal. Black Gold also argues that the discriminatory pricing had an impact on the price set by PSC for installing all rockwool insulation 
in the program and cites evidence in support of this allegation.  Given our analysis of the particular market dynamics in this case, 
we conclude that this fact, even if true, is irrelevant to our consideration of competitive impact. "
991,4," The circuits are split on whether discriminatory deliveries are within the proscription of section 2(e) of the Clayton Act, as 
amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.  See Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 546 (9th Cir. 1983). 
However, Black Gold has not claimed that the untimely deliveries in this case violated that section of the Act.  The scope of 
section 2(e) is thus not before us and we do not address it. "
992,5," Under current law, this showing is sufficient to establish the illegality of a tying arrangement under either section 3 of the

sustained on the ground adopted by the trial court.  Rockwool had sufficient market power in the tying product, blown wool, 
because this product was the only one approved for use in the PSC program.  Thus the tying product was both unique and 
desirable.  Moreover, construing the evidence and inferences most favorably to Black Gold, the dollar volume of rockwool batts 
tied to the sale of blown wool cannot be considered de minimis."

management services contract, 715 F.2d at 1236-37, and suggest that a two-year contract is reasonable as a matter of law, in 
view of a pertinent Illinois statute. The court has limited its consideration to the sufficiency of plaintiffs' allegations, however, and 
the complaint is silent as to the duration of the contract. This silence itself arguably is fatal under Johnson, which allocated to 
plaintiffs the burden of producing evidence that the contract is of unreasonable duration. Id. at 1237. "
998,2," Perhaps because of uneasiness with the practical applications of the tying doctrine, HN3[

Association M-1 v. Corley, 570 F. Supp. 453, 461 (N.D.Ill. 1983) (Hart, J.). Johnson upheld a complaint under a per se tying

only two of the eight deposed plaintiffs brought suit because they felt prices were too high; (2) one plaintiff (Levin) stated that he "

""typicality"" requirement.  The Court's September 30, 1983 Order held that the named representatives' claims are typical of both 
class members suing within the limitations period and class members relying upon fraudulent concealment allegations.  United 
National Records v. MCA, Inc., 99 F.R.D. 178, 181-82 (N.D. Ill. 1983). In any event, plaintiffs have also satisfied their burden of 
showing that the common issue of liability will predominate over individual issues arising from the fraudulent concealment 
allegations at trial. "
1005,5," Defendants are highly critical of the active role plaintiffs' attorneys are taking in this litigation, especially in drafting discovery 
responses and preparing their clients for depositions. Defendants' concerns, however, are apparently common in complex 
antitrust litigation.  See, e.g., Brown v. Cameron-Brown Co., 92 F.R.D. 32, 41 (E.D. Va. 1981). Although this Court is obviously 
sensitive to any danger that counsel in an antitrust case may act in its own self-interest and not in the best interest of the class, 
there has been no evidence presented in this case that any such danger exists. "
1006,6," The Manual For Complex Litigation recommends that a court determine whether subclasses are appropriate only after reliable 
economic data on the structure and practices of the industry are part of the record.  Manual For Complex Litigation ยง 1.42, at 32 
(4th ed. 1977)."
1006,7," Even assuming that defendants' contentions regarding the structure of the industry are true, it is difficult to envision that the 
retail class representatives will not adequately protect the interests of both subdistributors and retailers at trial.  According to 
defendants, retailers (including A Record and United) have an interest in pursuing the price fixing and returns policies claims 
while wholesalers would desire only to press the price fixing claims.  Although the named representatives may have an interest 
in pursuing an additional theory of liability, it does not automatically follow that the named representatives would not vigorously 
litigate the price fixing claim which is apparently common to both subdistributors and retailers. "

1011,3," The volume of available highway work is directly dependent on the amount of funds allocated to the state highway program.  
Substantial completion of the interstate highway system in the late 1960's resulted in a significant decrease in funds allocated for 
new highway construction in Ohio during the 1970's.  The highway program in northwestern Ohio during the 1970's was primarily 
limited to maintaining and upgrading the existing roadways."
1011,4," The practical service area of a hot-mix plant is limited to a 25-30 mile radius due to hauling costs and the need to deliver the 
product at specified temperatures.  The plants are typically located at or near quarries because of the high cost of hauling stone."

1012,6," Defendants' annual shares of the relevant ODOT and OTC projects were as follows: 1972 -- 65.3%; 1973 -- 57.6%; 1974 -- 
82.5%; 1975 -- 53.2%; 1976 -- 62.6%; 1977 -- 70.4%; 1978 -- 51.3%."
1012,7," To establish monopolization of the ODOT-OTC asphalt paving market, Langenderfer had to prove that Johnson unfairly 
attained or maintained monopoly power. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 
(1966). Monopoly power is ""the power to control prices or exclude competition."" Id. at 571."
1012,8," To establish that Johnson attempted to monopolize the ODOT-OTC asphalt paving market, Langenderfer had to prove that 
appellant ""engaged in anticompetitive conduct with the specific intent to monopolize and that the attempt had a dangerous 
probability of success."" Richter Concrete Corp. v. Hilltop Corp., 691 F.2d 818, 823 (6th Cir. 1982), (quoting United States v. 
Dairymen, Inc., 660 F.2d 192, 194 (6th Cir. 1981)). "
1013,9," Support for the allegations of other types of anticompetitive conduct was meager at best.  Although injunctive relief was granted 
against a broad array of wrongful acts, the trial court made the following observation about Langenderfer's proof: Plaintiffs request injunctions against certain anticompetitive practices of the defendants which were not specifically proven 
by evidence at trial.  For example, plaintiffs seek prohibitions against the defendants' alleged practices of charging 
discriminatory stone prices, refusing to sell stone or sand to plaintiffs, and tying sales of asphaltic concrete to purchases of 
stone and sand. (emphasis added)"
1013,10," Langenderfer attempts to rely on the testimony of Howard Shank who was Johnson's Vice President and chief bidding 
estimator.  Shank testified that in preparing bids, he often programmed specific items below cost.  The relevant product in this 
case, however, was the total package of asphalt paving materials and services, not specific line items in a contract bid. It matters 
little that Johnson might have employed a below-cost figure for gravel or any other item so long as the final bid exceeded the 
company's total projected costs."
1013,11," Even if the evidence had been sufficient to avoid a directed verdict, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the legal 
standard for predatory pricing was erroneous.  ""The choice of a cost-based standard for evaluating claims of predatory pricing is 
a question of law to be decided by the trial judge."" M.C.I. Communications Corp. v. A.T. & T. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1111 (7th Cir.

1013,12," Further support for this decision may be drawn from Judge Kennedy's dissent in Borden, Inc. v. F.T.C., 674 F.2d 498, 519 (6th 
Cir. 1982). While that case dealt with the manipulation of a price premium for a heavily advertised product, not below cost 
pricing, it was noted by that Judge that ""business acumen includes shrewdness in profitable price competition, which is pricing 
above average variable cost; the Sherman Act does not distinguish competition on the basis of price and performance."" Id.,

1018,1," As the Court notes in its opinion, this Circuit has recently adopted the Ninth Circuit's modified ""Areeda/Turner"" rule.  See ante 
at 1056.  Areeda and Turner first propounded a most influential discussion of how a determination of average variable costs can 
fairly approximate marginal cost at output levels at or near a firm's optimal level of output.  That level, of course, is where a firm 
is producing at its minimum average costs.  Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing & Related Practices Under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975). D. E. Rogers, 718 F.2d 1431, the case in which this circuit adopted the modified ""Areeda/Turner"" rule, makes no mention of 
what the rule should be in situations where, as here, the defendant was pricing at a level above average total cost.  Areeda and 
Turner would presume such to be legal.  The majority today agrees.  I do not, however, because I believe evidence of intent in 
circumstances such as presented in this case should play a substantial role in determining whether predatory pricing has 
occurred. "
1019,2," In Transamerica, 698 F.2d at 1387, the Ninth Circuit discusses how, in an industry where a substantial initial investment is 
required, a monopolist could predate with a pricing strategy that is above average total cost but below the profit maximizing price 
of competitors or potential competitors. This strategy is labeled ""limit pricing"", and appears to be the type of strategy employed 
by Johnson here."
1019,3," The Transamerica case's so-called ""extension,"" see ante at 1056, of William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental 
Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825, 103 S. Ct. 58, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1982), which the 
majority today refuses to follow, is the natural outgrowth of the Inglis case.  The Ninth Circuit has consistently indicated, even 
prior to Inglis, that given the right set of facts concerning a defendant's motive and conduct, it might very well hold a limit pricing 
strategy impermissible.  See California Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 743 (9th Cir. 1979); Hanson v. Shell 
Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1358 n.5 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 50 L. Ed. 2d 792, 97 S. Ct. 813 (1977). The Transamerica case takes the Inglis rule the next logical step and adopts a reasonable view of how to treat an alleged 
predator's prices that are above its average total cost.  It allocates a heavy burden upon the plaintiff to prove by clear and 
convincing evidence, that the defendant was predatorily pricing. Transamerica, 698 F.2d at 1388. At the same time, however, it 
does not allow a monopolist, such as Johnson in this case, to escape liability on the basis of predatory pricing merely because it 
did not price below its average total cost. The D. E. Rogers, 718 F.2d at 1436, case in this circuit likewise suggests that the Sixth Circuit would not permit a limit pricing 
scheme at or above average total cost upon a strong showing of motive and/or other monopolistic conduct.  While D. E. Rogers 
does not directly present the issue decided today, it does indicate just as Transamerica's predecessors that ""direct evidence 
bearing on the issue of [a defendant's] motive"" is an important consideration.  Id. at 1437. Indeed, only because of the absence 
of, or ambiguous nature of, such direct evidence was a cost-based analysis even resorted to in that case.  See id. at 1435. "
1025,1," As is explained more fully below, the only remaining claim is that challenging the ban on balance billing."
1025,2," The plaintiffs also complain (1) that Blue Cross helps perpetuate Blue Shield's control over the compensation that can be 
earned by physicians by refusing generally to compensate physicians other than salaried health care providers on the staffs of 
institutions, primarily hospitals, that enter into agreements with Blue Cross; (2) that Blue Shield directs its subscribers not to use 
non-participating physicians, and its participating physicians not to refer patients to non-participating physicians; and (3) that 
Blue Cross directs its participating hospitals not to employ non-participating physicians. "
1026,3," In Nelson, the Supreme Judicial Court ultimately dismissed the complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust 
their administrative remedies."
1026,4," The case was transferred to the undersigned on March 8, 1982, after Judge Skinner recused himself. When I first met with counsel in this case on April 1, 1982, I informed them that I had subscribed to Blue Cross/Blue Shield for 
many years, and continue to subscribe to the program. I then asked counsel to make any objections to my hearing the case a 
matter of record at that time.  None of the parties objected. "
1027,5," Counsel for all parties in the case were unresponsive and unhelpful when the Court asked them for their suggestions as to how 
they expected the Court to resolve the credibility of these two competing mountains of mostly meaningless papers."
1027,6," As this Court noted in its memorandum and order of June 30, 1982, 542 F. Supp. at 788, the Supreme Judicial Court of 
Massachusetts rejected defendants' claim that M.G.L. c. 176B invests in the Commissioner such absolute control over Blue 
Shield's operations that any existing Blue Shield scheme must necessarily be viewed as state policy and thus beyond the 
purview of federal antitrust law.  See Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 384 Mass. 409, 425 N.E.2d 313, 1981 Mass.Adv.Sh. 
at 1992-94."
1027,7," For a more detailed history of Blue Shield and its reimbursement systems, see the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court in 
Kartell, 384 Mass. 409, 425 N.E.2d 313, 1981 Mass.Adv.Sh. at 1985-89. "
1028,8," As this Court held in its memorandum and order of June 30, 1982, 542 F. Supp. at 790-91, the refusal to remunerate non-
participating physicians is, in and of itself, immune from antitrust challenge under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 
supra."
1028,9," Blue Cross also reimburses those physicians who treat Massachusetts state employees who are subscribers under a Blue 
Cross plan available only to employees of the Commonwealth. "
1029,10," When this method was first proposed in 1968, it was to be implemented only for group accounts under the Master Medical 
Certificate and for Blue Shield's coverage of the Federal Employee Program.  At present, however, it applies to all accounts 
except the few remaining Plan B subscribers. Approximately 90% of Blue Shield members now have coverage which includes 
the ban on balance billing. "
1031,11," Though plaintiffs steadfastly and pointedly referred throughout the trial to this second market as the ""market for private health 
insurance,"" their market definition is, in fact, substantially similar to that of defendants, whose nomenclature I now adopt. "
1032,12," Associated General Contractors was an action for damages brought under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15. However,

1033,13," McCready, a Blue Shield subscriber, alleged that Blue Shield and the Neuropsychiatric Society of Virginia, Inc. had unlawfully 
conspired to restrain competition in the market for psychotherapeutic services by providing insurance coverage only for 
consumers who patronized psychiatrists, not psychologists.  McCready had obtained services from a psychologist and had been 
denied reimbursement."
1033,14," Plaintiffs also allege that Blue Shield and Blue Cross have engaged in a horizontal restraint of trade by their joint medical care 
certificate and their other marketing agreements and joint administration.  HN10[
] M.G.L.c. 176A, ยง 5 and c. 176B, ยง 3 expressly authorize Blue Cross and Blue Shield to contract with each other ""for the joint administration of their business and for 
joint and co-operative writing and issuing of certificates."" Because any such agreement between Blue Cross and Blue Shield is 
likely exempt from antitrust scrutiny by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1011 et seq., see, e.g., Quality Auto 
Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 660 F.2d 1195, 2000-01 (7th Cir. 1981), and by virtue of the state action exemption, see 
Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), I analyze only the vertical arrangements between Blue 
Shield and the individual physicians. "

found a similar, but distinguishable, insurance scheme to be a per se violation and went on to note that ""this case [does not] 
present the question whether an insurer may, consistent with the Sherman Act, fix the fee schedule and enter into bilateral 
contracts with individual doctors. That question was not reached in Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 
U.S. 205, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 1067 (1979)."" Id. at 353 n.26. "
1036,16," In Sausalito and Medical Arts, plaintiff pharmacies unsuccessfully challenged provider agreements between themselves and 
Blue Cross.  The agreements between Blue Cross and participating pharmacies established the maximum prices which 
pharmacies could recover for prescription drugs supplied to Blue Cross subscribers. Under the reimbursement plan examined by 
the court in Medical Arts, which is substantially similar to the provider agreement at issue in Sausalito, Blue Cross subscribers 
who patronized ""participating"" pharmacies (i.e., those who had entered into agreements with Blue Cross) were required at most 
to pay the pharmacy a small ""deductible"" amount, and the pharmacy was reimbursed by Blue Cross at the rate established in 
the agreement.  Subscribers who patronized non-participating pharmacies paid the pharmacies the over-the-counter prices for 
prescriptions, and were reimbursed by Blue Cross at the rate established in the subscriber agreement with Blue Cross."
1036,17, The district court's opinion appears at 518 F. Supp. 1100 (D. Conn. 1981). 
1037,18," Plaintiffs acknowledge that defendants, and any other health insurers, are entitled to limit what they pay to physicians for 
medical services rendered to subscribers. Plaintiffs only contest an insurer's right to limit the total amount a physician can 
receive for medical services rendered."
1037,19," This Court considers itself bound by the decision in Maricopa, but notes that Justices O'Connor and Blackmun recused 
themselves and that Chief Justice Burger and Justices Powell and Rehnquist dissented.  How the Supreme Court would rule on 
this same issue in the next case to come before it is anyone's guess. "
1038,20," The physicians' agreement in Maricopa provided in part that the physician agreed ""to be bound . . . with respect to maximum 
fees . . . by any fee determination by the foundation consistent with the schedule adopted by the [foundation physician] 
membership . . . ."" The agreement also provided that foundation members ""understand and agree that participating membership 
in the foundation shall not affect the method of computation or amount of fees billed by [the physician] with respect to any 
medical care for any patient."" 457 U.S. at 359 (Powell, J., dissenting)."
1038,21," In Maricopa, the Court reflected on the procedural aspects of the creation of a fee schedule, and noted that an insurer, such 
as Blue Shield, is itself capable of creating a fee schedule through altogether different means: In order to create an insurance plan under which the doctor would agree to accept as full payment a fee prescribed in a 
fixed schedule, someone must canvass the doctors to determine what maximum prices would be high enough to attract 
sufficient numbers of individual doctors to sign up but low enough to make the insurance plan competitive. In this case that 
canvassing function is performed by the foundation; the foundation then deals with the insurer. It would seem that an 
insurer could simply bypass the foundation by performing the canvassing function and dealing with the doctors itself.  Under 
the foundation plan, each doctor must look at the maximum-fee schedule fixed by his competitors and vote for or against 
approval of the plan (and, if the plan is approved by majority vote, he must continue or revoke his foundation membership).  
A similar, if to some extent more protracted, process would occur if it were each insurer that offered the maximum-fee 
schedule to each doctor. Id. at 363-4 n.28. "
1039,22," Internal Blue Shield memoranda show that the purpose of the compression of the Level I and Level II fees is to produce a fee 
schedule for Blue Shield payments.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Exhibit 45. "
1040,23," A colonoscopy is a form of endoscopy in which the interior of the colon is examined using a colonoscope, a flexible fiberoptic 
instrument approximately six feet in length, which is introduced into the colon.  The endoscopist is able to examine the lining of 
the colon in great detail and is capable of using the same instrument to perform biopsies and other surgical procedures within 
the colon.  The removal of a benign tumor is called a polypectomy."
1040,24," The true economic cost of the procedure also includes wages foregone by a patient during the longer hospitalization and 
recovery."
1040,25," Defendants claim that the low initial level of payment by Blue Shield was due to an insufficiency of fee data and to incorrect 
filings by physicians.  Further, they argue that the initial interim fee established by Blue Shield's fee committee, though perhaps 
too low, was nonetheless reasonable. Both of these arguments miss the point.  The crucial point in plaintiffs' argument is not that 
Blue Shield's fee determination was ultimately unreasonable (though it may have been), but that the low initial fee, in conjunction 
with the ban, in fact deterred physician adoption of the new procedure. Precisely because a low fee determination by Blue 
Shield, even if made in good faith, can have these deleterious effects, it is especially important that during the early, formative 
development of a medical technique, the market, not Blue Shield, should determine the relative value of a procedure. "

1048,5," Other courts have acknowledged that all coconspirators in a vertical conspiracy need not be joined if the risk of multiple liability 
is slight.  In Royal Printing Co. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 621 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir. 1980), the court allowed an indirect 
purchaser to proceed with the action without joining the middle-agents.  The court stated: We recognize that there is, in fact, some small chance that such a subsidiary or division might wish to sue its parent's co-
conspirators. The parent might be under government pressure or discover that the conspiracy is not sufficiently profitable; 
and if a subsidiary has outside shareholders, a derivative suit might be a possibility.  In such an event, multiple liability 
might lurk. But because as a practical matter the chance of a direct-purchaser suit is so small, the correspondingly small risk of 
multiple recovery does not disturb us.  This is especially so when our only alternative is to effectively immunize the 
transactions here from private antitrust liability, thus thwarting a vital part of the antitrust enforcement scheme and the 
expressed purpose of Illinois Brick. [Footnotes omitted]  See also In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 516 F. Supp. 1287, 1294 (D. Md. 1981) (mere possibility of duplicitous 
recovery does not require dismissal under Illinois Brick). "
1049,6," The district court, however, read the new complaint differently.  The court felt the State was trying to alter its theory of recovery 
by alleging a vertical conspiracy and alleging new facts.  In re Midwest Milk Monopolization Litigation, 529 F. Supp. at 1342. As 
we noted previously, even if the complaint is construed to permit such a claim, failure to join the coconspirators moots the issue."

1054,1," Before we heard oral argument, the State agreed not to oppose a different motion to dismiss the indictment pending against 
Fiumara.  Fiumara had been returned to federal prison where he was serving concurrent federal prison terms of 20 years for "
1055,," extortion in New York.  Pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainer Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:159A-3(d), the indictment was not ""of

1055,2," Paragraph 9(c) provides: (c) During the period of the conspiracy and in the relevant area Anthony Tomae, a garbage collector and member of the 
T.W.A., sought a buyer for his garbage collection business.  TINO FIUMARA, MICHAEL COPPOLLA and LAWRENCE 
RICCI also known as LARRY POPPOLLA, instructed and directed Anthony Tomae through an unindicted co-conspirator to 
sell his garbage collection business to a party of their choosing.  FIUMARA, COPPOLLA and RICCI advised Tomae that as 
a member of the T.W.A. he had to clear the sale through CARMINE FRANCO, President of the T.W.A.  They further 
advised Tomae that if he refused to abide by their instruction and deal through CARMINE FRANCO his customer accounts 
would be solicited and taken by CARMINE FRANCO.  Moreover, it was the intention of FIUMARA, COPPOLLA and RICCI 
to obtain a fee of three per cent on the sale. Tomae successfully resisted the instruction and direction emanating from FIUMARA, COPPOLLA and RICCI by using the 
influence and pressure of other persons who were not members of the T.W.A. nor engaged in the business of garbage 
collection, but who exercise power and influence equal to that of FIUMARA, COPPOLLA and RICCI. "
1056,3," Harold Kaufman, another witness, specifically mentioned Fiumara in his testimony."
1056,4," Kelly explained that remark as follows: Q.  What does he mean by that; would you tell the Grand Jury or indicate for the record what he meant by that? A.  Well, if Mr. Coppola [sic] arranged the sale of the Tomae garbage route he would have to guarantee that the buyers 
would not lose any stops and that no other garbagemen would try to go in and interfere with the stops that went with the 
Tomae route. Q.  All right, and would there be any obligation on the buyer with respect to taking of other people's stops; is that inherent in 
that at all? A.  Yes, and the new buyer would also only be able to service the stops bought on the Tomae route or, again, any new 
stops that he was given permission to take."

1071,3, The contract required all of the physicians employed by Roux to confine their practice of anesthesiology to East Jefferson.
1071,4," Originally Roux agreed to provide at least two full-time anesthesiologists acceptable to the hospital's credentials committee.  
Roux agreed to furnish additional anesthesiologists as necessary.  The contract also provided that Roux would designate one of 
its qualified anesthesiologists to serve as the head of the hospital's department of anesthesia. The fees for anesthesiological services are billed separately to the patients by the hospital.  They cover the hospital's costs and 
the professional services provided by Roux.  After a deduction of eight percent to provide a reserve for uncollectible accounts, 
the fees are divided equally between Roux and the hospital."
1071,5," ""Roux testified that he requested the omission of the exclusive language in his 1976 contract because he believes a surgeon or 
patient is entitled to the services of the anesthesiologist of his choice.  He admitted that he and others in his group did work 
outside East Jefferson following the 1976 contract but felt he was not in violation of the contract in light of the changes made in 
it."" 513 F.Supp. 532, 537 (ED La. 1981)."

hospital in an area containing at least twenty others providing the same surgical services.  It would be a different situation if Dr. 
Roux had exclusive contracts in several hospitals in the relevant market.  As pointed out by plaintiff, the majority of surgeons 
have privileges at more than one hospital in the area.  They have the option of admitting their patients to another hospital where 
they can select the anesthesiologist of their choice.  Similarly a patient can go to another hospital if he is not satisfied with the 
physicians available at East Jefferson."" Id., at 541."
1072,8," While the Court of Appeals did discuss the impact of the contract upon patients, it did not discuss its impact upon 
anesthesiologists. The District Court had referred to evidence that in the entire State of Louisiana there are 156 
anesthesiologists and 345 hospitals with operating rooms.  The record does not tell us how many of the hospitals in the New 
Orleans metropolitan area have ""open"" anesthesiology departments and how many have closed departments.  Respondent, for 
example, practices with two other anesthesiologists at a hospital which has an open department; he previously practiced for 
several years in a different New Orleans hospital and, prior to that, had practiced in Florida.  The record does not tell us whether 
there is a shortage or a surplus of anesthesiologists in any part of the country, or whether they are thriving or starving."

in other communities or through mail-order houses that can not be procured at their local stores.  The price is raised as an 
inducement.  This is the local effect.  Where the concern making these contracts is already great and powerful, such as the 
United Shoe Machinery Co., the American Tobacco Co., and the General Film Co., the exclusive or 'tying' contract made with 
local dealers becomes one of the greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by the brain of man.  It 
completely shuts out competitors, not only from trade in which they are already engaged, but from the opportunities to build up 
trade in any community where these great and powerful combinations are operating under this system and practice.  By this 
method and practice the Shoe Machinery Co. has built up a monopoly that owns and controls the entire machinery now being 
used by all great shoe-manufacturing houses of the United States.  No independent manufacturer of shoe machines has the 
slightest opportunity to build up any considerable trade in this country while this condition obtains.  If a manufacturer who is 
using machines of the Shoe Machinery Co. were to purchase and place a machine manufacturered by any independent 
company in his establishment, the Shoe Machinery Co. could under its contracts withdraw all their machinery from the 
establishment of the shoe manufacturer and thereby wreck the business of the manufacturer.  The General Film Co., by the "
1074,," same method practiced by the Shoe Machinery Co. under the lease system, has practically destroyed all competition and 
acquired a virtual monopoly of all films manufactured and sold in the United States.  When we consider contracts of sales made

the lease system."" H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 12-13 (1914). Similarly, Representative Mitchell said: ""[Monopoly] has been built up by these 'tying' contracts so that in order to get one 
machine one must take all of the essential machines, or practically all.  Independent companies who have sought to enter the 
field have found that the markets have been preempted. . . .  The manufacturers do not want to break their contracts with these 
giant monopolies, because, if they should attempt to install machinery, their business might be jeopardized and all of the 
machinery now leased by these giant monopolies would be removed from their places of business.  No situation cries more 
urgently for relief than does this situation, and this bill seeks to prevent exclusive 'tying' contracts that have brought about a 
monopoly, alike injurious to the small dealers, to the manufacturers, and grossly unfair to those who seek to enter the field of 
competition and to the millions of consumers."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9090 (1914)."

proscription is meant to guard is the use of power over one product to attain power over another, or otherwise to distort freedom 
of trade and competition in the second product.  This distortion injures the buyers of the second product, who because of their 
preference for the seller's brand of the first are artificially forced to make a less than optimal choice in the second.  And even if 
the customer is indifferent among brands of the second product and therefore loses nothing by agreeing to use the seller's brand 
of the second in order to get his brand of the first, such tying agreements may work significant restraints on competition in the 
tied product.  The tying seller may be working toward a monopoly position in the tied product and, even if he is not, the practice 
of tying forecloses other sellers of the tied product and makes it more difficult for new firms to enter that market.  They must be 
prepared not only to match existing sellers of the tied product in price and quality, but to offset the attraction of the tying product 
itself.  Even if this is possible through simultaneous entry into production of the tying product, entry into both markets is 
significantly more expensive than simple entry into the tied market, and shifting buying habits in the tied product is considerably 
more cumbersome and less responsive to variations in competitive offers.  In addition to these anticompetitive effects in the tied 
product, tying arrangements may be used to evade price control in the tying product through clandestine transfer of the profit to 
the tied product; they may be used as a counting device to effect price discrimination; and they may be used to force a full line of 
products on the customer so as to extract more easily from him a monopoly return on one unique product in the line."" Fortner I,

1077,26," ""As pointed out before, the defendant was initially granted large acreages by Congress in the several Northwestern States 
through which its lines now run.  This land was strategically located in checkerboard fashion amid private holdings and within 
economic distance of transportation facilities.  Not only the testimony of various witnesses but common sense makes it evident 
that this particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business 
activities.  In disposing of its holdings the defendant entered into contracts of sale or lease covering at least several million acres 
of land which included 'preferential routing' clauses.  The very existence of this host of tying arrangements is itself compelling 
evidence of the defendant's great power, at least where, as here, no other explanation has been offered for the existence of 
these restraints.  The 'preferential routing' clauses conferred no benefit on the purchasers or lessees.  While they got the land 
they wanted by yielding their freedom to deal with competing carriers, the defendant makes no claim that it came any cheaper 
than if the restrictive clauses had been omitted.  In fact any such price reduction in return for rail shipments would have quite 
plainly constituted an unlawful rebate to the shipper.  So far as the Railroad was concerned its purpose obviously was to fence 
out competitors, to stifle competition."" 356 U.S., at 7-8 (footnote omitted)."

1077,28," It is essential to differentiate between the Roux contract and the legality of the contract between the hospital and its patients. 
The Roux contract is nothing more than an arrangement whereby Roux supplies all of the hospital's needs for anesthesiological 
services.  That contract raises only an exclusive-dealing question, see n. 51, infra.  The issue here is whether the hospital's 
insistence that its patients purchase anesthesiological services from Roux creates a tying arrangement."

1078,30," The fact that anesthesiological services are functionally linked to the other services provided by the hospital is not in itself 
sufficient to remove the Roux contract from the realm of tying arrangements.  We have often found arrangements involving 
functionally linked products at least one of which is useless without the other to be prohibited tying devices.  See Mercoid Corp.

the functional link between the two items may enable the seller to maximize its monopoly return on the tying item as a means of 
charging a higher rent or purchase price to a larger user of the tying item.  See n. 23, supra."
1078,31," ""The District Court determined that the Times-Picayune and the States were separate and distinct newspapers, though 
published under single ownership and control.  But that readers consciously distinguished between these two publications does 
not necessarily imply that advertisers bought separate and distinct products when insertions were placed in the Times-Picayune 
and the States.  So to conclude here would involve speculation that advertisers bought space motivated by considerations other 
than customer coverage; that their media selections, in effect, rested on generic qualities differentiating morning from evening 
readers in New Orleans.  Although advertising space in the Times-Picayune, as the sole morning daily, was doubtless essential 
to blanket coverage of the local newspaper readership, nothing in the record suggests that advertisers viewed the city's 
newspaper readers, morning or evening, as other than fungible customer potential.  We must assume, therefore, that the 
readership 'bought' by advertisers in the Times-Picayune was the selfsame 'product' sold by the States and, for that matter, the 
Item. ""The factual departure from the 'tying' cases then becomes manifest.  The common core of the adjudicated unlawful tying 
arrangements is the forced purchase of a second distinct commodity with the desired purchase of a dominant 'tying' product, 
resulting in economic harm to competition in the 'tied' market.  Here, however, two newspapers under single ownership at the 
same place, time, and terms sell indistinguishable products to advertisers; no dominant 'tying' product exists (in fact, since space 
in neither the Times-Picayune nor the States can be bought alone, one may be viewed as 'tying' as the other); no leverage in 
one market excludes sellers in the second, because for present purposes the products are identical and the market the same."" 
345 U.S., at 613-614 (footnote omitted)."
1078,32," ""There is, at the outset of every tie-in case, including the familiar cases involving physical goods, the problem of determining 
whether two separate products are in fact involved.  In the usual sale on credit the seller, a single individual or corporation, 
simply makes an agreement determining when and how much he will be paid for his product.  In such a sale the credit may 
constitute such an inseparable part of the purchase price for the item that the entire transaction could be considered to involve 
only a single product.  It will be time enough to pass on the issue of credit sales when a case involving it actually arises.  Sales 
such as that are a far cry from the arrangement involved here, where the credit is provided by one corporation on condition that 
a product be purchased from a separate corporation, and where the borrower contracts to obtain a large sum of money over and 
above that needed to pay the seller for the physical products purchased.  Whatever the standards for determining exactly when 
a transaction involves only a 'single product,' we cannot see how an arrangement such as that present in this case could ever be 
said to involve only a single product."" 394 U.S., at 507 (footnote omitted). "
1079,33," Professor Dam has pointed out that the per se rule against tying can be coherent only if tying is defined by reference to the 
economic effect of the arrangement. ""[The] definitional question is hard to separate from the question when tie-ins are harmful.  Yet the decisions, in adopting the per 
se rule, have attempted to flee from that economic question by ruling that tying arrangements are presumptively harmful, at least 
whenever certain nominal threshold standards on power and foreclosure are met.  The weakness of the per se methodology is 
that it places crucial importance on the definition of the practice.  Once an arrangement falls within the defined limits, no 
justification will be heard.  But a per se rule gives no economic standards for defining the practice.  To treat the definitional 
question as an abstract inquiry into whether one or two products is involved is thus to compound the weakness of the per se 
approach."" Dam, supra n. 23, at 19."
1079,34," Of course, the Sherman Act does not prohibit ""tying""; it prohibits ""[contracts] . . . in restraint of trade."" Thus, in a sense the 
question whether this case involves ""tying"" is beside the point.  The legality of petitioners' conduct depends on its competitive 
consequences, not on whether it can be labeled ""tying."" If the competitive consequences of this arrangement are not those to 
which the per se rule is addressed, then it should not be condemned irrespective of its label."

1079,36," Testimony that patients and their physicians frequently do differentiate between hospital services and anesthesiological 
services, and request specific anesthesiologists, was provided by Dr. Roux, Tr. 17, 20 (May 15, 1980, afternoon session), Dr. 
Hyde, id., at 68-69, 72-74 (May 16, 1980), and other anesthesiologists as well, see id., at 64, 87-88 (May 15, 1980, afternoon 
session) (testimony of Dr. Charles Eckert); id., at 25-30, 33-34 (May 16, 1980) (testimony of Dr. John Adriani).  There was no 
testimony that patients or their surgeons do not differentiate between anesthesiological services and hospital services when 
making purchasing decisions.  As a statistical matter, only 27 percent of anesthesiologists have financial relationships with 
hospitals.  American Medical Association, Socioeconomic Characteristics of Medical Practice: 1983, p. 12 (1983).  In this respect "
1080,," anesthesiologists may differ from radiologists, pathologists, and other types of hospital-based physicians (HBPs).  ""In some 
respects anesthesiologists are more akin to office-based MDs (particularly surgeons) than other HBPs.  Anesthesiologists' 
outputs are more discrete, and these HBPs are predominantly fee-for-service practitioners who directly provide services to 
patients."" Steinwald, Hospital-Based Physicians: Current Issues and Descriptive Evidence, Health Care Financing Rev. 63, 69 
(Summer 1980).  See also United States v. American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., 473 F.Supp. 147, 150 (SDNY 1979) 
(""By 1957 the salaried anesthesiologist had become the exception.  Anesthesiologists began to establish independent practices 
and were able to obtain hospital privileges upon the same terms and conditions as other clinicians"")."
1080,37," Accordingly, in its conclusions of law the District Court treated the case as involving a tying arrangement. 513 F.Supp., at 542."
1080,38, Petitioners do not challenge these findings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
1080,39," One of the most frequently cited statements on this subject was made by Judge Van Dusen in United States v. Jerrold 
Electronics Corp., 187 F.Supp. 545 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 567 (1961) (per curiam).  While this statement was specifically 
made with respect to ยง 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 14, its analysis is also applicable to ยง 1 of the Sherman Act, since with 
respect to the definition of tying the standards used by the two statutes are the same.  See Times-Picayune, 345 U.S., at 608-
609. ""There are several facts presented in this record which tend to show that a community television antenna system cannot 
properly be characterized as a single product.  Others who entered the community antenna field offered all of the equipment 
necessary for a complete system, but none of them sold their gear exclusively as a single package as did Jerrold.  The record 
also establishes that the number of pieces in each system varied considerably so that hardly any two versions of the alleged 
product were the same.  Furthermore, the customer was charged for each item of equipment and not a lump sum for the total 
system.  Finally, while Jerrold had cable and antennas to sell which were manufactured by other concerns, it only required that 
the electronic equipment in the system be bought from it."" 187 F.Supp., at 559. The record here shows that other hospitals often permit anesthesiological services to be purchased separately, that 
anesthesiologists are not fungible in that the services provided by each are not precisely the same, that anesthesiological 
services are billed separately, and that the hospital required purchases from Roux even though other anesthesiologists were 
available and Roux had no objection to their receiving staff privileges at East Jefferson.  Therefore, the Jerrold analysis indicates 
that there was a tying arrangement here.  Jerrold also indicates that tying may be permissible when necessary to enable a new 
business to break into the market.  See id., at 555-558. Assuming this defense exists, and assuming it justified the 1971 Roux 
contract in order to give Roux an incentive to go to work at a new hospital with an uncertain future, that justification is 
inapplicable to the 1976 contract, since by then Roux was willing to continue to service the hospital without a tying arrangement."
1080,40," This is not to say that ยง 1 of the Sherman Act gives a purchaser the right to buy a product that the seller does not wish to offer 
for sale.  A grocer may decide to carry four brands of cookies and no more.  If the customer wants a fifth brand, he may go 
elsewhere but he cannot sue the grocer even if there is no other in town.  However, in such a case the customer is free to 
purchase no cookies at all, while buying other needed food.  If the grocer required the customer to buy an unwanted brand of 
cookies in order to buy other items which the customer needs and cannot readily obtain elsewhere, then a tying question arises.  
Cf. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S., at 7 (grocer selling flour can require customers to also buy sugar only ""if 
its competitors were ready and able to sell flour by itself"").  Here, the question is whether patients are forced to use an unwanted 
anesthesiologist in order to obtain needed hospital services. "
1081,41," An examination of the reason or reasons why petitioners denied respondent staff privileges will not provide the answer to the 
question whether the package of services they offered to their patients is an illegal tying arrangement. As a matter of antitrust 
law, petitioners may give their anesthesiology business to Roux because he is the best doctor available, because he is willing to 
work long hours, or because he is the son-in-law of the hospital administrator without violating the per se rule against tying. 
Without evidence that petitioners are using market power to force Roux upon patients there is no basis to view the arrangement 
as unreasonably restraining competition whatever the reasons for its creation.  Conversely, with such evidence, the per se rule 
against tying may apply.  Thus, we reject the view of the District Court that the legality of an arrangement of this kind turns on 
whether it was adopted for the purpose of improving patient care."
1081,42," Petitioners argue and the District Court found that the exclusive contract had what it characterized as procompetitive 
justifications in that an exclusive contract ensures 24-hour anesthesiology coverage, enables flexible scheduling, and facilitates 
work routine, professional standards, and maintenance of equipment.  The Court of Appeals held these findings to be clearly 
erroneous since the exclusive contract was not necessary to achieve these ends.  Roux was willing to provide 24-hour coverage 
even without an exclusive contract and the credentials committee of the hospital could impose standards for staff privileges that 
would ensure staff would comply with the demands of scheduling, maintenance, and professional standards.  686 F.2d, at 292. 
In the past, we have refused to tolerate manifestly anticompetitive conduct simply because the health care industry is involved.  
See Arizona v. Maricopa Medical Society, 457 U.S., at 348-351; National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378 
(1981); American Medical Assn. v. United States, 317 U.S. 519, 528-529 (1943). Petitioners seek no special solicitude.  See n. 
12, supra.  We have also uniformly rejected similar ""goodwill"" defenses for tying arrangements, finding that the use of 
contractual quality specifications are generally sufficient to protect quality without the use of a tying arrangement. See Standard 
Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U.S., at 305-306; International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S., at 397-398; 
International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S., at 138-140. See generally Comment, Tying Arrangements 
under the Antitrust Laws: The ""Integrity of the Product"" Defense, 62 Mich. L. Rev. 1413 (1964). Since the District Court made no 
finding as to why contractual quality specifications would not protect the hospital, there is no basis for departing from our prior 
cases here."
1081,43," In fact its position in this market is not dissimilar from the market share at issue in Times-Picayune, which the Court found 
insufficient as a basis for inferring market power.  See 345 U.S., at 611-613. Moreover, in other antitrust contexts this Court has 
found that market shares comparable to that present here do not create an unacceptable likelihood of anticompetitive conduct.  
See United States v. Connecticut National Bank, 418 U.S. 656 (1974); United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 
U.S. 377 (1956). "
1082,44," The Court of Appeals acknowledged that absent these market imperfections, there was no basis for applying the per se rule 
against tying. ""The contract at issue here involved only one hospital out of at least twenty in the area.  Under the analysis applied 
to a truly competitive market, appellant has failed to prove an illegal tying arrangement."" 686 F.2d, at 290."
1082,45," Congress has found these market imperfections to exist.  See National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S., at 388, 
n. 13, 391-393, and n. 18; 42 U. S. C. ยงยง 300k, 300k-2(b); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 96-420, pp. 57-58 (1979); S. Rep. No. 96-96, pp. 
52-53 (1979)."
1082,46," As an economic matter, market power exists whenever prices can be raised above the levels that would be charged in a 
competitive market.  See Fortner II, 429 U.S., at 620; Fortner I, 394 U.S., at 503-504."
1082,47," Nor is there an indication in the record that petitioners' practices have increased the social costs of their market power.  Since 
patients' anesthesiological needs are fixed by medical judgment, respondent does not argue that the tying arrangement 
facilitates price discrimination.  Where variable-quantity purchasing is unavailable as a means to enable price discrimination, 
commentators have seen less justification for condemning tying. See Dam, supra n. 23, at 15-17; Turner, supra n. 21, at 67-72.  
While tying arrangements like the one at issue here are unlikely to be used to facilitate price discrimination, they could have the 
similar effect of enabling hospitals ""to evade price control in the tying product through clandestine transfer of the profit to the tied 
product. . . ."" Fortner I, 394 U.S., at 513 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Insurance companies are the principal source of price restraint 
in the hospital industry; they place some limitations on the ability of hospitals to exploit their market power.  Through this 
arrangement, petitioners may be able to evade that restraint by obtaining a portion of the anesthesiologists' fees and therefore 
realize a greater return than they could in the absence of the arrangement.  This could also have an adverse effect on the 
anesthesiology market since it is possible that only less able anesthesiologists would be willing to give up part of their fees in 
return for the security of an exclusive contract. However, there are no findings of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals 
which indicate that this type of exploitation of market power has occurred here.  The Court of Appeals found only that Roux's use 
of nurse anesthetists increased its and the hospital's profits, but there was no finding that nurse anesthetists might not be used 
with equal frequency absent the exclusive contract. Indeed, the District Court found that nurse anesthetists are utilized in all 
hospitals in the area.  513 F.Supp., at 537, 543. Moreover, there is nothing in the record which details whether this arrangement 
has enhanced the value of East Jefferson's market power or harmed quality competition in the anesthesiology market. "
1083,48," While there was some rather impressionistic testimony that the prevalence of exclusive contracts tended to discourage young 
doctors from entering the market, the evidence was equivocal and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals made any 
findings concerning the contract's effect on entry barriers.  Respondent does not press the point before this Court.  It is possible 
that under some circumstances an exclusive contract could raise entry barriers since anesthesiologists could not compete for 
the contract without raising the capital necessary to run a hospitalwide operation.  However, since the hospital has provided 
most of the capital for the exclusive contractor in this case, that problem does not appear to be present."
1083,49," While it is true that purchasers may not be fully sensitive to the price or quality implications of a tying arrangement, so that 
competition may be impeded, see n. 24, supra, this depends on an empirical demonstration concerning the effect of the 
arrangement on price or quality, and the record reveals little if anything about the effect of this arrangement on the market for 
anesthesiological services."
1083,50," If, as is likely, it is the patient's doctor and not the patient who selects an anesthesiologist, the doctor can simply take the 
patient elsewhere if he is dissatisfied with Roux.  The District Court found that most doctors in the area have staff privileges at 
more than one hospital.  513 F.Supp., at 541."
1083,51," LEdHN[17B][
] [17B] The effect of the contract, of course, has been to remove the East Jefferson Hospital from the market open to Roux's 
competitors. Like any exclusive-requirements contract, this contract could be unlawful if it foreclosed so much of the market from 
penetration by Roux's competitors as to unreasonably restrain competition in the affected market, the market for 
anesthesiological services.  See generally Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961); Standard Oil Co. of 
California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293 (1949). However, respondent has not attempted to make this showing."
1083,52," The record simply tells us little if anything about the effect of this arrangement on price or quality of anesthesiological services.  
As to price, the arrangement did not lead to an increase in the price charged to the patient. 686 F.2d, at 291. As to quality, the 
record indicates little more than that there have never been any complaints about the quality of Roux's services, and no 
contention that his services are in any respect inferior to those of respondent.  Moreover, the self-interest of the hospital, as well 
as the ethical and professional norms under which it operates, presumably protect the quality of anesthesiological services.  See 
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, Accreditation Manual for Hospitals 3-10, 151-154 (1983). "
1084,53," See App. A to Brief for American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., as Amicus Curiae."
1084,54," The claims raised by respondent but not passed upon by the Court of Appeals remain open on remand.  See n. 2, supra. "
1085,1," This inquiry has been required in analyzing both the prima facie case and affirmative defenses.  Most notably, United States v. 
Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F.Supp. 545, 559-560 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567 (1961), upheld a requirement 
that buyers of television systems purchase the complete system, as well as installation and repair service, on the grounds that 
the tie assured that the systems would operate and thereby protected the seller's business reputation."
1085,2," Tying law is particularly anomalous in this respect because arrangements largely indistinguishable from tie-ins are generally 
analyzed under the rule of reason.  For example, the ""per se"" analysis of tie-ins subjects restrictions on a franchisee's freedom to 
purchase supplies to a more searching scrutiny than restrictions on his freedom to sell his products.  Compare, e. g., Siegel v. 
Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (CA9 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955 (1972), with Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania 
Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977). And exclusive contracts that, like tie-ins, require the buyer to purchase a product from one seller are 
subject only to the rule of reason.  See infra, at 44-45. "
1086,3," See n. 4, infra."
1086,4," Tying might be undesirable in two other instances, but the hospital-Roux arrangement involves neither one. In a regulated industry a firm with market power may be unable to extract a supercompetitive profit because it lacks control over 
the prices it charges for regulated products or services.  Tying may then be used to extract that profit from sale of the 
unregulated, tied products or services.  See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 513 (1969) 
(WHITE, J., dissenting). Tying may also help the seller engage in price discrimination by ""metering"" the buyer's use of the tying product.  Cf. International 
Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131 (1936); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392 (1947). 
Price discrimination may be independently unlawful, see 15 U. S. C. ยง 13. Price discrimination may, however, decrease rather 
than increase the economic costs of a seller's market power.  See, e. g., R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 398 (1978); P. Areeda, 
Antitrust Analysis 608-610 (3d ed. 1981); O. Williamson, Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications 11-13 
(1975).  United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 617 (1977) (Fortner II), did not hold that price 
discrimination in the form of a tie-in is always economically harmful; that case indicated only that price discrimination may 
indicate market power in the tying-product market.  But there is no need in this case to address the problem of price 
discrimination facilitated by tying. The discussion herein is aimed only at tying arrangements as to which no price discrimination 
is alleged."
1086,5," Wholly apart from market characteristics, a prerequisite to application of the Sherman Act is an effect on interstate commerce.  
See, e. g., McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 246 (1980); Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 322 (1967). It 
is not disputed that such an impact is present here."
1086,6," The Court has failed in the past to define how much market power is necessary, but in the context of this case it is 
inappropriate to attempt to resolve that question.  In International Salt Co. v. United States, supra, the Court assumed that a 
patent conferred market power and therefore sufficiently established ""the tendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of 
monopoly."" Id., at 396.  In its next tying case, Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594 (1953), the Court 
distinguished International Salt in part by finding that there was no market ""dominance,"" 345 U.S., at 610-613, after a careful "
1087,," consideration of the relevant market.  Then, in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6-8, 11 (1958), the Court 
required only a minimal showing of market power.  More recently, in Fortner II, supra, the Court conducted a more extensive 
analysis of whether the tie was actually an exercise of market power, considering such factors as the size and profitability of the 
firm seeking to impose the tie, the character of the tying product, and the effects of the tie -- the price charged for the products, 
the number of customers affected, the functional relation between the tied and tying product."
1087,7," A common misconception has been that a patent or copyright, a high market share, or a unique product that competitors are 
not able to offer suffices to demonstrate market power.  While each of these three factors might help to give market power to a 
seller, it is also possible that a seller in these situations will have no market power: for example, a patent holder has no market 
power in any relevant sense if there are close substitutes for the patented product.  Similarly, a high market share indicates 
market power only if the market is properly defined to include all reasonable substitutes for the product.  See generally Landes & 
Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937 (1981). Nor does any presumption of market power find support in our prior cases.  Although United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 
334 U.S. 131 (1948), considered the legality of ""block-booking"" of motion pictures, which ties the purchase of rights to 
copyrighted motion pictures to purchase of other motion pictures of the same copyright holder, the Court did not analyze the 
arrangement with the schema of the tying cases.  Rather, the Court borrowed the patent law principle of ""patent misuse,"" which 
prevents the holder of a patent from using the patent to require his customers to purchase unpatented products.  Id., at 156-159. 
See, e. g., Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661, 665 (1944). The ""patent misuse"" doctrine may have 
influenced the Court's willingness to strike down the arrangement at issue in International Salt as well, although the Court did not 
cite the doctrine in that case."
1087,8," Whether the tying product is one that consumers might wish to purchase without the tied product should be irrelevant.  Once it 
is conceded that the seller has market power over the tying product it follows that the seller can sell the tying product on 
noncompetitive terms.  The injury to consumers does not depend on whether the seller chooses to charge a supercompetitive 
price, or charges a competitive price but insists that consumers also buy a product that they do not want."
1087,9," Cf. Areeda, supra n. 4, at 735; Ross, The Single Product Issue in Antitrust Tying: A Functional Approach, 23 Emory L. J. 963, 
1010 (1974); Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19, 21-23 (1957). "
1088,10," The examination of the economic advantages of tying may properly be conducted as part of the rule-of-reason analysis, rather 
than at the threshold of the tying inquiry.  This approach is consistent with this Court's occasional references to the problem.  
The Court has not heretofore had occasion to set forth any general criteria for determining when two apparently separate 
products are components of a single product for tying analysis.  In Times-Picayune Publishing Co., the Court held that 
advertising space in a morning newspaper was the same product as advertising space in the evening newspaper -- access to 
readership of the respective newspapers -- because the subscribers had no reason to distinguish among the readers of the two 
papers.  345 U.S., at 613-616. In Fortner I, the Court, reversing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, rejected the 
contention that credit could never be separate from the product for whose purchase credit was extended.  394 U.S., at 506-507. 
The Court disclaimed any determination of ""the standards for determining exactly when a transaction involves only a single 
product."" Id., at 507. These cases indicate that consideration of whether a buyer might prefer to purchase one component 
without the other is one of the factors in tying analysis and, more generally, that economic analysis rather than mere 
conventional separability into different markets should determine whether one or two products are involved in the alleged tie. "
1089,11," See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a); Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 855-858 (1982)."
1089,12," While the record appears to be devoid of factual findings on this point the assumption is a safe one, and certainly one that 
finds no contradiction in the record. "
1090,13," The Court of Appeals disregarded the benefits of the tie because it found that there were less restrictive means of achieving 
them.  In the absence of an adequate basis to expect any harm to competition from the tie-in, this objection is simply irrelevant. "

1099,9," Boroughs had actually urged the Commission to reduce the ratebase; they had subtracted from the working capital amount 
yielded by the thirteen-day net lag amounts collected from customers to pay interest on long-term debt, taxes, and dividends.  
The ALJ rejected these adjustments because he found that these were not working capital items.  ALJ I, 9 FERC at p. 65,160. 
Boroughs appear no longer to advocate the inclusion of these amounts."
1099,10," This disparity is attributable primarily to the use in Boroughs' study of an estimated 15-day ""payment lag"" -- the time from 
billing to payment -- when the actual payment lag was about 30 days according to Penn witnesses and the single customer 
study.  As we note below, the Commission pointed out that there was also a fifteen day overestimate in this study: it had used a 
30-day rather than a 15-day ""service lag."" Apart from this error, the Commission found without objection that this single-
customer study was not an adequate substitute for the 45-day convention. FERC I, 12 FERC at n.18. "
1100,11," Boroughs also objected to the application of the 45-day rule on the grounds that the Commission's current formulation of the 
rule's meaning -- the estimated lag from the time of payment of expenditures for services to the time of receipt of revenues for 
those services -- is a misstatement of the rule.  It cites the original formulation in Interstate Power Co., 2 FPC 71, 85 (1939), as 
the correct one: ""the full period between the dates of rendition of services and the payment."" The Commission points out in 
response that since 1949 it has used the current formulation -- the period between expenditures and receipt of revenue.  See 
Pennsylvania Water & Power Co., 8 FPC 1, 75 (1949). We agree with the Commission that ""Boroughs' argument ignores 40-odd 
years of Commission practice,"" Brief for FERC at 31, and must be rejected. "

because it had failed to adjust estimates of wholesale customers' demand even though the estimates were unsupported by a

1104,16," Boroughs claimed, in other words, that a retail customer with precisely the same cost characteristics as Boroughs would pay 
the lower rates offered under one of Penn's retail rate schedules.  They urged the Commission to find a price squeeze whenever 
the retail rate, for which Boroughs would qualify but for their identity as wholesale/resale customers, was lower than the 
wholesale rate.  This theory was urged by the municipalities in Batavia, 217 U.S. App. D.C. 211, 672 F.2d 64, and rejected in 
favor of the Commission's rate of return test, described infra, which we found to be more sensitive to differences in cost 
characteristics between the two classes of customers. Id. at 89-90."
1104,17," Penn had urged the exclusion of those of its customers, six in number, that were served at the highest voltage level because 
Boroughs did not have and had never requested the capability of serving at 138 KV.  In other words, Penn argued, these 
customers were not properly included in the target of competition because Boroughs could not compete for them.  The 138 KV 
customers yielded a low rate of return -- 4.23% compared with 4.64% and 5.20% for other industrial retail customers. Their 
exclusion, therefore, would raise slightly the overall rate of return for the target of competition, thus reducing the magnitude of 
the disparity that indicated a price squeeze. See ALJ II, 11 FERC at p. 65,049. "
1105,18," See ALJ II, 11 FERC at p. 65,049. According to Penn's own figures, the wholesale customers yielded a rate of return under 
the proposed rates (i.e., those that took effect after suspension on September 11, 1977) of 9.31%, compared with rates of return 
between 4.23% and 5.20% for various classes of industrial customers under the retail rates effective until August 31, 1978.  
Non-industrial retail customers yielded a rate of return of 5.72%; exclusion of those customers thus resulted in a disparity of 
somewhat greater magnitude than would have appeared if all retail classes had been included in the comparison."
1105,19, See supra note 17.
1105,20," The prior state law provided that rates must be filed two months before their proposed effective date, and could then be 
suspended for up to nine months. 66 Pa. Stat. ยง 1148(b) (repealed).  But it also permitted the state commission to impose 
temporary rates, which could be equal to preexisting rates, for an indefinite period until final rates were determined. 66 Pa. Stat.

temporary rates but with an explicit exception in the case of a general rate increase such as that in the case before us. 66 Pa.

1106,22," The Commission based this conclusion in part on a footnote from our decision in Batavia, 672 F.2d at 90 n.52: Further, neither Conway nor Batavia require the Commission to set a wholesale rate so that wholesale customers are 
guaranteed the ability to compete in the retail market.  It may be, for instance, that the state commission is not allowing an 
adequate rate of return. If so, the Commission is not obliged to follow, and indeed may not follow suit, for the rates it sets 
must fall within the zone of reasonableness. . . .  (Emphasis supplied by Commission.) The obvious and limited meaning of this passage is that if the rates set by the state 
commission were so low as to create a price squeeze at the lowest reasonable wholesale rate, the Commission could still not 
set rates below that level.  The Commission brushed aside this interpretation, apparently because it thought the point was too 
obvious.  It interpreted the passage instead as support for the view that the Commission should not, as a general rule, lower 
rates at all -- even within the zone of reasonableness -- in response to state regulatory actions.  The Commission's interpretation 
of our decision borders on the disingenuous. "
1107,23," In preparing materials requested by the Commission in its ""Order Requesting Additional Filings,"" Penn discovered that it had 
made a ""computational error"" in its compliance filing in calculating certain fuel adjustment charges it expected to receive.  This 
error, when incorporated into the ""just and reasonable"" rates approved by the Commission in Phase I, resulted in a loss, through 
excessive refunds, of about $300,000.  Penn unsuccessfully petitioned the Commission for recovery of this amount, and 
appealed the Commission's decision to this court.  We agreed with the Commission that Penn's request ran afoul of both the 
""filed rate doctrine,"" see Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., 341 U.S. 246, 251, 95 L. Ed. 912, 71 S. 
Ct. 692 (1951), and the principle against retroactive ratemaking, see Public Serv. Co. v. FERC, 600 F.2d 944, 958 (D.C. Cir. 
1979), and denied Penn's petition.  Pennsylvania Power Co. v. FERC, No. 83-1294 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 13, 1984) (per curiam). "
1108,24," We have previously indicated that the Commission's power to remedy a price squeeze was limited by the lower end of the 
zone of reasonableness. See Batavia, 672 F.2d at 90 n.52. "
1110,25," We assume, although the Commission has not found it necessary to decide, that the price squeeze remedy would be limited 
to the period of the price squeeze -- i.e., in this case 11 1/2 months -- rather than the entire period for which the wholesale rate 
was in effect.  Of course we do not decide that this must be so."
1110,26," See ALJ II, 11 FERC at p. 65,051. "
1111,27," The Commission's analysis is roughly analogous to a truncated employment discrimination doctrine that permitted the 
employer to defeat a prima facie case of discrimination merely by articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for a hiring 
decision without allowing the victim to show that the articulated reason was actually a mere pretext for discrimination.  Cf.  Texas 
Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-56, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981). Of course, we do not 
suggest that the Commission should adopt the framework of Title VII for its price squeeze doctrine; we mention it only as an 
analogy to show what we see as a gap in the Commission's logic. "

circumstances such as the effect of Penn's computation error, as Commissioner Sheldon would have done.  See supra at 972. "

1123,2," The respondents contend that although certiorari is the proper vehicle to challenge a lower court order denying a motion to

1125,4," The broad definition of ""trade or commerce"" in the Florida Antitrust Act, ยง 542.17(4), Fla.Stat. (1981), that is, ""any economic 
activity of any type whatsoever involving any commodity or service whatsoever,"" has been held to encompass a restraint upon 
the practice of medicine of the type here alleged.  See Hackett v. Metropolitan General Hosp., 422 So.2d 986. We think it 
obvious that any unlawful restraint upon the delivery of medical services is not merely a private matter and that, therefore, the 
rationale of the federal cases is applicable to the present case.  Cf.  Greenleaf Engineering & Construction Co. v. Teradyne, Inc., 
15 Mass.App.Ct. 571, 447 N.E.2d 9 (App.Ct. 1983) (refusing to apply federal decisions holding antitrust claims non-arbitrable

S. Ct. 608, 54 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1977). In such a case, where the antitrust issues are said to permeate the arbitrable issues, courts 
have stayed arbitration and proceeded to determine the antitrust issues, see Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 444 F. Supp. 68 (S.D.N.Y. 
1977); Applied Digital Technology, Inc., 576 F.2d 116; or denied arbitration even of the arbitrable claims ""in order to protect the

1169 (11th Cir. 1982); but see Dickinson v. Heinold Securities, Inc., 661 F.2d 638 (7th Cir. 1981) (permeation doctrine merely 
authorizes court to control the order of adjudications, but does not authorize court to adjudicate arbitrable claims).  The question 
before us, however, is the propriety of the trial court's stay of the judicial proceedings, not of arbitration. "
1138,1," The distinction raised by the Cantor plurality therefore seems to accord to that articulated in Goldfarb: for the anticompetitive 
acts of private entities to escape antitrust liability, ""it is not enough that . . . anticompetitive conduct is prompted by state action; 
rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign."" 421 U.S. 773, 791, 44 L. Ed.

1139,5," Moreover, even if certain acts of a state agency might deserve antitrust immunity under the ""state action"" theory, it does not 
necessarily follow that ""every act of a state agency is that of ther State as sovereign."" 435 U.S. at 410 (emphasis added). If the 
agency or municipality transgresses the bounds of its authority to establish trade restraints, Parker immunity will not attach."

1141,9," In Gosnell, the court sustained the constitutionality of the Act in the face of a challenge by one who had been convicted and 
fined for practicing without proper certification from the Dental Board. Since Gosnell, the Arkansas Supreme Court has upheld 
the regulatory scheme for dentistry against allegations that, by restricting practice to licensed dentists, it violates the first and 
fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. See Missionary Supporters, Inc. v. Arkansas State Board of Dental 
Examiners, 231 Ark. 38, 328 S.W.2d 139 (1959). Indeed, as recently as 1982, the Court rejected allegations that an unlicensed 
""denturist"" was denied due process and equal protection by virtue of the Act's implementation by the Board.  Hulva v. Arkansas 
State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 277 Ark. 397, 642 S.W.2d 296 (1982). Hulva also rejected contentions that the Act improperly 
delegated legislative power to the Board.  Id. at 400. The history of court activity involving the Act is punctuated even by decisions involving two of the plaintiffs in this case. In Hinsley 
v. Arkansas State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 276 Ark. 243, 633 S.W.2d 696 (1982), the Arkansas Supreme Court vacated 
disciplinary sanctions imposed against plaintiff Neil Hinsley on the grounds that the regulations under which he had been 
charged were not in effect at the time of the alleged violations. In Brazil v. Arkansas State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 279 Ark. 41, 
648 S.W.2d 476 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld a contempt-of-court finding against plaintiff Barry Brazil after he violated an 
injunction previously entered against him due to violations of the Act's provisions regarding unauthorized practice of dentistry 
and improper advertising."
1141,10, The ban is backed by civil and criminal sanctions. See ยง 72-541. 
1142,11," Such rules and regulations must be adopted in compliance with the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, Ark. Stat. Ann. ยงยง

1142,12," This provision apparently supersedes that provision of ยง 72-559, which prohibits any corporation from practicing dentistry or 
dental hygiene. "
1145,13," Section 72-544's reference to section 72-543 suggests that any advertising rules are subject to judicial review. Indeed, as in 
Bates, for any enforcement actions brought pursuant to the advertising limitation, the Arkansas Supreme Court would be the 
ultimate trier of fact and law. See 433 U.S. at 350 (Arizona Supreme Court serves as the ultimate trier of fact and law)."
1145,14," Gambrel employed the relatively stringent Midcal requirements.  Although this Court believes that the Midcal test is not

Churning will be discussed in more detail infra."
1165,10," Defendants fear that they shall be required to go through each and every transaction consummated during the relevant period 
in order to answer the complaints.  I have previously rejected an identical argument.  See Kimmel, 565 F. Supp. at 481. "
1166,11," Paragraph 25, which contains the substantive allegations, provides: Showing himself to be a recidivist, defendant Catanella took on more customers than he could possibly handle on a 
responsible basis; directed that unauthorized transactions be made for his customers, frequently on a mass basis, without 
regard to the suitability of the transaction to the particular customer; repeatedly churned accounts so as to generate 
commissions to himself and Hutton; engaged in margin and options trading without disclosing the risks or costs inherent in 
such practices and otherwise conducted himself in a manner designed to improperly regard the defendants at the expense 
of plaintiff and the Class."
1166,12," I am mindful that the requirements of Rule 9(b) must be relaxed in the class action context.  As this court has noted: A strict application of Rule 9(b) in class action securities fraud cases could result in substantial unfairness to persons who 
are the victims of fraudulent conduct.  This is especially true where many matters are peculiarly within the knowledge of the 
defendants.  Certainly in such cases, once plaintiff has satisfied the minimum burden of Rule 9(b), plaintiff should be 
allowed to flesh out the allegations in the complaint through discovery.  This is in keeping with the liberal view espoused by 
the Federal Rules. Denny v. Carey, 72 F.R.D. 574, 578 (E.D. Pa. 1976) (citations omitted)."
1166,13," Defendants argue that the RICO counts also violate Rule 9(b) as they incorporate by reference, rather than alleging the 
relevant facts.  This contention defies logic.  The RICO claims are predicated upon the acts of securities fraud. If the underlying 
securities fraud satisfies the rule, by necessity, so must the RICO allegations.  Incorporation by reference is perfectly appropriate 
-- indeed setting out the facts a second time would be an exercise in redundancy. Along similar lines, defendants in Gaugler and Shulik assail the particularity of various state law claims sounding in fraud.  They 
argue that they are unable to discern from the complaint what conduct is alleged to be fraudulent or constitute a breach of 
fiduciary duty.  Plaintiffs have incorporated the earlier factual allegations by reference, rather than restating the facts giving rise 
to each theory of liability. I find this method of pleading appropriate.  After reviewing these complaints, I find that the allegations 
giving rise to the various theories of liability are sufficiently specific to satisfy Rule 9(b). "
1167,14," In addition, defendants challenge the use of certain words and phrases, including the characterization of Catanella as a 
""recidivist."" Although this court does not sanction ""name-calling"" and ""mud-slinging,"" assuming the truth of the allegations 
contained in the complaints, this word is merely descriptive.  I do not find the language at issue ""impertinent or scandalous."""
1167,15," Given the allegations of multiple violations within each complaint, the Brown case is not technically necessary to a finding of a 
""pattern,"" but is supportive nevertheless.  Should plaintiffs fail to prove more than one violation, however, it could become critical 
to the viability of the RICO claim. "
1168,16," Section 10(b) provides: HN12[
] It shall be unlawful for any person. . . ."

1169,18," A private right of action was first implied under section 10(b) in this district.  See Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., 69 F. Supp. 
512, 513-14 (E.D. Pa. 1946). Most lower federal courts followed this lead. The Supreme Court, with virtually no discussion, 
finally gave its imprimatur to this private remedy in Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U.S. 6, 13, 
30 L. Ed. 2d 128, 92 S. Ct. 165 n.9 (1971)."
1169,19," The original definition in TSC also noted that in order to fund materiality, ""there must be a substantial likelihood that the 
disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of 
information made available."" 426 U.S. at 449."
1169,20," Ernst resolved the question of whether negligence was sufficient for the imposition of liability under section 10(b).  In a 
footnote the Court stated: In this opinion the term ""scienter"" refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.  In certain 
areas of the law recklessness is considered to be a form of intentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability for some 
act.  We need not address here the question whether, in some circumstances, reckless behavior is sufficient for civil liability 
under ยง 10(b) and Rule 10b-5."
1169,425, U.S. at 194 n.12. 
1170,21," Defendants accuse plaintiffs of ""bootstrapping"" -- interpreting many of the allegations as failures to disclose breaches of 
fiduciary duties.  In support of their proposition, they cite Biesenbach v. Guenther, 588 F.2d 400 (3d Cir. 1978). In Biesenbach, 
the court did reject the concept that ""the failure to disclose the breach of a fiduciary duty is sufficient to constitute a violation of 
the Act."" Id. at 402. In the first instance, Biesenbach is factually inapposite here.  Plaintiffs were minority shareholders 
challenging the terms of loans made to the corporation by individual directors.  It was a pure state law claim for the breach of a 
fiduciary duty.  In fact, plaintiffs lacked standing to sue under section 10(b), as they had not purchased or sold securities.  Id. at 
401 n.1. Contrary to defendants' argument, it appears that this Circuit has accorded Santa Fe a very narrow construction.  In 
Santa Fe, the plaintiffs did allege that the failure to disclose the merger before the fact was a material omission. However, under 
Delaware law, appraisal was the only remedy -- the knowledge of the merger would not have aided them in stopping it.  
Consequently, the Court held the failure to disclose to be non-material.  Santa Fe, 430 U.S. at 474 n.14. Following the Second 
Circuit in the controversial Goldberg v. Meridor, 567 F.2d 209 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1069, 55 L. Ed. 2d 771, 98 
S. Ct. 1249 (1978), this Circuit held the failure to disclose merger information actionable where the plaintiff had the right to seek 
a state law injunction.  See Healey v. Catalyst Recovery of Pennsylvania, Inc., 616 F.2d 641, 646-47 (3d Cir. 1980). Therefore, it 
would seem that in this Circuit, where there has been a material omission or misrepresentation, there is a remedy under section 
10(b).  See also Dower v. Mosser Ind. Inc., 488 F. Supp. 1328, 1333 (E.D. Pa. 1980), aff'd. 648 F.2d 183 (3d Cir. 1981) (failure 
to disclose information about merger more than breach of duty under Santa Fe)."
1170,22," I will not, at this point, discuss the thorny problems arising from the causation and ""in connection with"" elements.  These will be 
discussed in separate sections infra. "
1171,23," See also Troyer v. Karcagi, 476 F. Supp. 1142, 1146 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (failure to disclose employers role as ""market maker"" 
material omission)."
1171,24," In their motions to dismiss, defendants dissect each paragraph of the complaints, a method of analysis which might lose sight 
of the larger picture.  They assume that each paragraph, standing alone, must state a separate cause of action. There may well 
be paragraphs which do not. I could proceed through each complaint, paragraph by paragraph, highlighting the alleged fraud 
which rises to the level of a section 10(b) violation.  However, that would serve no useful purpose. "
1172,25," Various factors aid in the determination of excessiveness, including the turnover ratio and the investment objectives.  See e.g., 
Costello, 711 F.2d at 1368; Mihara, 619 F.2d at 821. The Costello court explained: HN26[
] The essential issue of fact is whether the volume of transactions, considered in light of the nature and objectives 
of the account, was so excessive as to indicate a purpose on the part of the broker to derive a profit for himself at the 
expense of his customer. Costello, 711 F.2d at 1368. Similarly, the inquiry into the level of control exercised by the broker focuses upon various factors.  If 
the account is discretionary, such that the broker need not gain the customer's consent, the requisite control is obvious.  Mihara, 
619 F.2d at 821. However, where the account is not discretionary, factors such as the sophistication and intelligence of the 
customer will become critical.  The Follansbee court asked ""whether or not the customer has sufficient intelligence and 
understanding to evaluate the broker's recommendations and to reject one when he thinks it unsuitable."" Follansbee, 681 F.2d 
at 677. In contrast, the Mihara court noted that the ""requisite degree of control is met when the client routinely follows the 
recommendations of the broker."" Mihara, 619 F.2d at 821. However, whether plaintiffs can prove the requisite degree of control 
and excessiveness must await later proceedings in this litigation."
1172,26," In Costello, the court rejected a third prong requiring proof that the customer was unsophisticated about the market.  711 F.2d 
at 1368 n.8. The court properly concluded that the relative sophistication of the customer is better viewed as another indicia of 
control.  Id. "
1173,27," In Shulik and Gaugler, defendants argue that misrepresentations as to the use of Hutton's research facilities do not arise ""in 
connection with"" a transaction.  In Gaugler, the hiding of excess cash in plaintiff's account and Granville's ""hand-holding"" are 
also challenged on this basis. "
1174,28," The court concluded: It would appear, then, that the present case does not constitute an instance in which misrepresentations were tendered ""in 
connection with"" a securities transaction.  To the contrary, the purportedly deceptive practices occurred, if at all, in 
connection with the struggle for control of the corporation.  Unlike Bankers Life, where the fraudulent conduct of the 
defendants undergirded the securities transaction, it cannot be said here that the misrepresentations bear a similar 
relationship to the forced sale of plaintiffs' stock. Ketchum, 557 F.2d at 1027-28."
1174,29," In Ketchum, the court suggested that ""connection"" and ""causation"" are related inquiries.  However, the court also recognized 
that they are not identical.  Ketchum, 557 F.2d at 1028-29. Accord Coons v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc., 539 F. Supp. 1145, 
1146-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). In Bankers Life, for example, the sale of Treasury Bonds ""only made possible the accomplishment of 
the fraud as opposed to having caused it."" Ketchum, 557 F.2d at 1029 (emphasis in original).  Yet the court also noted that both 
concepts ""speak to the proximity required between a misrepresentation and a securities transaction."" Id. "
1175,30," Ketchum was decided three months after Santa Fe was handed down.  The court, without citing to Santa Fe, opined that ""to 
reinstate the present lawsuit, might tend to promote further incursions by federal courts into areas and activities now regulated 
by state corporation laws.  557 F.2d at 1029. Coming so close on the heels of Santa Fe, Ketchum may reflect the court's use of 
the connection element to limit section 10(b)'s application to the corporate battlefield."
1175,31," The district court's dismissal of the section 10(b) claim was ultimately affirmed in Cramer on grounds unrelated to the 
connection issue.  Cramer was a derivative suit and the shareholders failed to make a demand on the Board under Rule 23.1 of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or prove that such a demand would be futile.  Cramer, 582 F.2d at 276-77. "
1176,32," With respect to the misrepresentation of the intent to use research facilities, defendants cite Wilson v. First Houston Inv. Corp., 
566 F.2d 1235 (5th Cir. 1978), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 444 U.S. 959, 100 S. Ct. 442, 62 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1979), 
for the proposition that this is not ""in connection with"" a securities transaction.  In Wilson, the alleged failure to use the promised 
computer analysis was apparently the only claim advanced.  Without analysis, the court simply declared the fraud too remote 
from the transactions.  566 F.2d at 1243. Thus, Wilson lends little guidance.  Unlike Wilson, this case involves a multifaceted 
scheme to induce investors to trust defendants for the purpose of defrauding them.  If defendants found this representation 
important in their decision to employ defendants' services and if it was an inducement to give Catanella carte blanche, it may be 
""in connection with"" future transactions.  It is not the connection that I question so much as the materiality of this representation, 
given everything else plaintiffs were told.  To the extent that this hinges upon a factual determination, it is not proper for 
resolution at this time. Granville's alleged ""hand holding"" does not appear to be a substantive allegation, but rather sets the stage for his potential 
liability upon the various theories of vicarious responsibility advanced by plaintiffs.  It shows knowledge of and participation in, 
the scheme to defraud.  As such, it shall not be dismissed. With respect to the averment that defendants were ""hiding"" Gauguler's cash position from him, that is simply one more instance 
of failing to disclose an intent to self-deal. Although I could probably imagine a way to link that to a transaction, it would be 
strained at best.  Nor is it clear that this allegation was intended to state a separate section 10(b) claim, see note 24, supra. 
However, this claim will not be dismissed from the complaint, as it may satisfy a requirement under a state law theory of liability. "
1177,33," Defendants also cite Kung v. Catanella, No. 82-1350 (D.N.J. October 7, 1982), a case somewhat similar to these complaints. 
In Kung, it appears that many of the misrepresentations did not concern an actual purchase or sale.  Kung, bench op. at 5.  
However, to the extent that Kung follows Troyer, the following discussion expresses my disagreement with both. "
1178,34," In Savino v. E.F. Hutton & Co., Inc., 507 F. Sup. 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), the court followed Troyer, but made no mention of the 
dichotomy relied upon by defendants.  The Savino court proceeded through the same two step analysis, first analyzing the 
misrepresentations made in connection with the discretionary accounts.  Id. at 1239-40. The court also adopted the Troyer 
formulation of ""purchasing,"" concluding that a purchase was accomplished when additional funds were injected into an existing 
account.  Id. at 1240. The court then proceeded to look at transactions involving the underlying securities, concluding that the 
misrepresentation of the risks of option trading was ""in connection with"" the securities so traded.  Id. at 1240-41."
1178,35," Defendants' distinction might ""overrule"" Bankers Life and Cramer. In Cramer, the alleged fraud did not induce the sale of the 
ownership interest -- indeed the reverse was true.  In Bankers Life, there was some element of fraud involved in persuading the 
Board of Manhattan to sell the Treasury Bonds.  However, the fraud did not relate to the sale of the bonds themselves, but 
rather, the purpose behind that sale.  The real deception in Bankers Life surrounded how Manhattan had been acquired and how 
the proceeds of the sale would be used."
1178,36," In Sutton, 490 F. Supp. 98 (N.D. Ill. 1980), a brokerage firm was sued for failing to disclose that one of its brokers had been 
the subject of customer complaints.  The court found disclosure would probably serve the policies underlying section 10(b) and 
denied a motion to dismiss. Factually, Sutton is roughly equivalent to the failure to disclose the Brown litigation, although the 
latter is arguably worse.  In discussing the disclosure requirements, the court stated: It is true that full disclosure is at the very heart of ยง 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and that they were intended to protect the investor 
from the harsh common law rule of caveat emptor. And, while it may be too burdensome to impose a duty upon a 
brokerage firm to disclose each customer complaint registered against one of its representatives, this is hardly the situation 
at bar.  On the contrary, here we are dealing with a brokerage firm which after investigation entered into monetary 
settlements with its customers for the alleged wrong-doings of one of its brokers and required the broker to execute a 
promissory note in its favor for the amounts paid in settlement."
1178,490, F. Supp. at 101-102. 
1179,37," For purposes of this motion, the Taraborelli plaintiffs rely upon the failure to disclose Brown as the exclusive basis for their 
section 10(b) claim."
1179,38," Borrowing from common law tort principles, transaction causation is roughly equivalent to ""cause-in-fact."" See e.g., Wilson v. 
Comtech Telecommunications Corp., 648 F.2d 88, 92 n.6 (2d Cir. 1981). Loss causation would be the securities analogue for 
""proximate cause."""
1179,39," In their motions, defendants accuse plaintiffs of confusing the reliance and causation requirements.  Perhaps plaintiffs were 
not careful to indicate which type of causation they had in mind, however, defendants' accusation is not well taken. "
1180,40," Some courts still struggle with the allocation of the burden of proof and the characterization of the fraud as an omission, 
misrepresentation or both.  See generally Sharp, 649 F.2d at 188-189. The Sharp court concluded that ""the proper approach to 
the problem of reliance is to analyze the plaintiff's allegations, in light of the likely proof at trial, and determine the most 
reasonable placement of the burden of proof of reliance."" Id. at 188. Accord Frankel v. Wyllie & Thornhill, Inc., 537 F. Supp. 730, 
738-40 (W.D. Va. 1982)."
1180,41," Contrary to the suggestion in the responses to motions to dismiss, the Supreme Court did not review this portion of the 
Huddleston holding.  Nor did the decision in Shores, 647 F.2d 462 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc) signal a retrenchment from this 
position.  Thus, Huddleston's discussion on loss causation remains good law. "
1182,42," This holding does not affect plaintiffs' rights to recover based upon the underlying fraud.  That is, plaintiffs continue to have a 
claim for Catanella's misrepresentation or failure to disclose the suitability of a given security."
1182,43," Plaintiffs point out that a motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. They argue that causation is a factual 
issue that should be resolved by a jury.  However, on a motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true all of plaintiffs' allegations.  I 
have assumed that plaintiffs have sustained injuries.  However, given the facts in the complaints, these injuries cannot be 
causally linked to the previous litigation, as a matter of law."
1182,44," Since the Taraborelli plaintiffs rely only upon the failure to disclose Brown, their section 10(b) claim must be dismissed.  
However, they shall have twenty days from the date of this Memorandum and Order in which to amend their complaint, should 
they choose to alter their theory in light of the resolution of this issue."
1182,45," Section 12(2) provides: HN36[
] Any person who -- (2) offers or sells a security . . . by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate 
commerce or of the mails, by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a 
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading (the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission), and who shall not 
sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such 
untruth or omission, shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity "
1183,," in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the 
amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security."
1183,15, U.S.C. ยง 77l(2) (1976).
1183,46," Plaintiffs contend that section 12(2) actions may be brought against a seller or ""those whose participation in the buy-sell 
transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place."" Singer Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss at 19; Rastelli Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 19 (both quoting Pharo v. 
Smith, 621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir. 1980)). Since the Third Circuit has limited the class to those who sold or who occupied a 
special relationship vis-a-vis the seller, see Collins v. Signetics Corp., 605 F.2d 110, 113 (3d Cir. 1979), it is not at all clear that 
the court would follow the Pharo approach.  The Collins court did not define the concept of ""special relationship,"" but used a 
control relation as an example.  Whatever else this relationship is, it does not exist between an issuer and its underwriters.  The 
plaintiffs in Collins attempted to sue the issuer, even though they had purchased from the underwriters handling the offering.  
The court determined that they had no section 12(2) cause against the issuer, as it did not control or otherwise have a special 
relationship with the members of the underwriting syndicate.  Collins, 605 F.2d at 113. Moreover, the language employed by the 
Collins court is suggestive of a restrictive interpretation of section 12(2). The court stated that the provision ""is designed as a 
vehicle for a purchaser to claim against his immediate seller.  Any broader interpretation would . . . only torture the plain meaning 
of the statutory language . . . ."" Id. Other circuit courts have taken a slightly more expansive view of the privity requirement, using the substantial factor test 
articulated by plaintiff.  See e.g., Admiralty Fund v. Jones, 677 F.2d 1289, 1294 (9th Cir. 1982); Junker v. Crory, 650 F.2d 1349, 
1360 (5th Cir. 1981); Stokes v. Lokken, 644 F.2d 779, 785 (8th Cir. 1981); Pharo v. Smith, 621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir.), aff'd in 
part, remanded in part on other grounds, 625 F.2d 1226 (5th Cir. 1980). Given the more restrictive view espoused in Collins, it is 
not clear whether the Third Circuit would follow these other courts.  However, in light of my resolution of the issue, I need not 
decide how the Third Circuit would rule and whether defendants ""substantially participated"" under Pharo and progeny. "
1184,47, This is the only basis upon which Catanella and Hutton challenge the claims of secondary liability.
1184,48, This same reasoning dictates that the claims for vicarious liability asserted in Taraborelli must be dismissed. 
1185,49," The complaint does not indicate whether Granville was present during its playing or knew of its use.  Gaugler states that 
Granville was present in his Memorandum in Opposition to Granville's Motion to Dismiss at 8.  However, that is not a pleading 
and as such, cannot be considered.  However, it is permissible to infer that, at the very least, Granville knew about the tape and 
its intended use."
1185,50," Granville does not specifically argue the respondeat superior issue, but rather makes references to it discussing the other 
theories of vicarious liability.  To the extent that it has not been raised, I will address it sua sponte. "
1186,51," Plaintiff asserts that the complaint does not concede control.  He interprets paragraph 18, in conjunction with paragraphs 20 
and 27, to mean that Granville assisted Catanella in the fraud.  Granville advised his subscribers to ""get out of the market,"" or 
""sell short,"" while helping Catanella to keep Gaugler ""long."" This was accomplished, Gaugler contends, by Granville's 
representations that he agreed with Catanella's ""long"" strategy. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant 
Granville's Motion to Dismiss at 9.  Although this may be relevant to Granville's liability as an aider and abettor, it does not rebut 
defendant's control argument.  The fact that Granville knew that Catanella was not following his strategy does not change the 
fact Catanella did not always do as Granville suggested.  Put another way, Granville did not have any power over Catanella to 
bend his will or even influence his decisions.  If anything, this argument places Granville in a secondary role. Catanella was 
""calling the shots"" and Granville was following along and lending assistance. "

of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(4)."
1188,55," As the court stated in Harper: It is simply incomprehensible that a plaintiff suing under the securities laws would receive one-third the damages of a 
plaintiff suing under RICO for the same injury.  While RICO utilizes and sometimes expands upon the offenses designed as 
racketeering activities, there is no evidence that it was meant to pre-empt or supplement the remedies already provided by 
those statutes which define a predicate RICO offense. Harper, 545 F. Supp. at 1007-08 (citations omitted).  Quoting from the now overruled district court opinion in Moss v. Morgan 
Stanley, the court in Hokama agreed that ""there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to create a 
private right of action for treble damages for violations of substantive statutes by ordinary business or parties."" Hokama, 566 F. "
1189,," Supp. at 643. See also Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 574 F. Supp. 963, 965 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (RICO not intended to grant 
windfall where injuries otherwise compensable)."
1189,56," Fraud in the sale of securities is listed as a form of ""racketeering activity."" See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(1)(D), quoted at note 43, 
supra. At least two courts have explicitly held that fraud in the purchase of securities is also a predicate offense.  See Hanna 
Mining Co. v. Norden Energy Resources, Ltd., 574 F. Supp. 1172, 1982 Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P 98,742 at 93, 738 (N.D. Ohio 
1982); Spencer Cos. v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., 1981Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P 98,361 at 92,215 (D. Mass. 1981). As the 
Spencer court aptly noted ""the remedial purpose of the statute would appear to encompass fraud committed by the purchaser of 
securities, as well as the seller."" Spencer, 1981Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P 98,361 at 92,215. I agree that the reach of RICO 
should extend to both purchases and sales. The complaints allege more than two instances of fraud within ten years, thus satisfying the ""pattern"" element.  Defendants do 
not question the ""enterprise"" prong, nor do they challenge whether Catanella as an employee of the ""enterprise,"" has conducted 
the affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c). Defendants do argue that the inclusion of allegations of mail and wire fraud cannot rise to the level of a pattern of racketeering, 
since there is no private right of action under those criminal statutes.  Because I have found a sufficient pattern of racketeering 
vis-a-vis the securities claims, I need not resolve this issue.  However, by enacting section 1964(c), Congress has granted a civil 
remedy not for the mere violation of a criminal statute, but rather for violations of section 1962.  A violation of section 1962 may 
well be grounded upon violations of criminal statutes, but the other RICO elements, e.g., a ""pattern"" and an ""enterprise"" are also 
required.  RICO does not grant a private right of action for an instance of isolated criminal conduct. "
1190,57," Plaintiffs have not raised the argument that the common law fraud claim would serve as ""fraud in the sale of securities"" under 
section 1961(1)(D).  This rather vague phrase is not defined in the statute and its parameters have yet to be explored.  It is not 
clear whether it embraces any fraud in the sale of securities or only violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  See generally 
Bridges, Private RICO Litigation Based Upon ""Fraud in the Sale of Securities,"" 18 Ga. L. Rev. 43, 58-63 (1983). For example, 
""fraud in the sale of securities"" appears in section 1961(1)(D), which list other federal offenses.  The state offenses are found in 
section 1961(1)(A). This placement may indicate that the phrase ""fraud in the sale of securities"" was not intended to reference 
state common law fraud.  However, I need not resolve this largely ignored issue.  Assuming that common law fraud would serve 
as a predicate act, the claim based upon Brown is plagued by causation deficiencies in both the section 10(b) and common law 
fraud area.  Thus, neither section 10(b) or common law fraud would afford a remedy for the failure to disclose Brown. As such, 
Brown cannot serve as a predicate offense under either theory.  See Moss, 719 F.2d at 18-19 n.14 (did not define scope of 
""fraud in the sale of securities"", as both federal and common law fraud claims were dismissed). "
1191,58," No court of appeals has required a link to organized crime. However, in dicta in Dan River, Inc. v. Icahn, 701 F.2d 278 (4th Cir. 
1983), the Fourth Circuit hinted that it might be disposed to do so.  The court explicitly refused to decide the issue, which arose 
in the context of a preliminary injunction.  The court did express the universal concern over RICO's breadth, observing: Finally, we meet the mounting controversy with federal courts over the proper limits, if any, upon the use of RICO on cases 
far removed from the context which Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute.  Congress was out to attack the 
problem of organized crime, not the problems of corporate control and risk arbitrage.  We of course make no attempt to 
resolve the dispute here and now.  We do not propose to enter the fray. Dan River, 701 F.2d at 291. "
1192,59," Similarly, section 1964(c) grants a remedy to ""any person injured in his business or property . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964(c) 
(emphasis added).  There are no restrictions on the status of plaintiff or defendant in a RICO action."
1192,60," In addition to the definitional problems, imagine the obstacle confronting a plaintiff who must prove affiliation with organized 
crime. As I noted in Kimmel, ""if it were easy enough for a private plaintiff to prove, then RICO would probably not have been 
necessary in the first instance."" Kimmel, 565 F. Supp. at 492. "
1193,61," As Judge Posner recently noted: Congress deliberately cast the net of liability wide, being more concerned to avoid opening loopholes through which the 
minions of organized crime might crawl to freedom than to avoid making garden-variety frauds actionable in federal treble 
damage proceedings -- the price of eliminating all possible loopholes. Sutliff, Inc. v. Donovan Cos., Inc., 727 F.2d 648, slip op. at 7 (7th Cir. 1984)."
1193,62," A report issued by that body feared that RICO could be utilized in virtually any securities fraud case.  The report stated in part: Within the definition of 'racketeering activity' is 'fraud in the sale of securities.' Against the background of expanding 
securities regulation, this definition could include the various officers, directors, and employees of corporations and 
underwriters of securities who have been found guilty of fraud in the sale of securities in some of the recent Rule 10(b)5 
cases.  Fraud in the sale of securities is simply not synonymous with racketeering activity. Relating to the Control of Organized Crime in the United States: Hearings on S.30 and Related Proposals Before Subcomm. No.

1194,63," Accord Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 574 F. Supp. 963, 965 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Sedima was decided after the Second 
Circuit rejected the organized crime limitation in Moss. The court noted the split between the competitive injury and racketeer 
enterprise injury requirements.  However, it did not find it necessary to choose between the two, as neither requirement was 
satisfied.  Implying that one of the two would be required, the court remarked: I find no allegation here of any injury apart from that which would result directly from the alleged predicate acts of mail fraud 
and wire fraud.  To permit the RICO claim to stand under such circumstances would represent an unwarranted extension of 
the statute's coverage that is not supported by the caselaw. Sedima, 574 F. Supp. at 965. RICO counts were therefore dismissed.  Id. "
1195,64," In footnote 11, the court stated that ""a RICO violation does not depend upon the existence of a competitive injury."" Van 
Schaick, 535 F. Supp. at 1137 n.11. Instead, the court followed Landmark's racketeer enterprise injury, adding the twist that the 
injury must be commercial in nature. Id."
1195,65," Senator Hruska, when introducing an earlier version of the statute, explained: Patterned closely after the Sherman Act, it provides for private treble damage suits, prospective injunctive relief, unlimited 
discovery procedures and all the other devices which bring to bear the full panoply of our antitrust machinery in aid of the 
businessman competing with organized crime. . . . The bill is innovative in the sense that it vitalizes procedures which have been tried and proven in the antitrust field and 
applies them where they have been seldom used before."
1195,115," Cong. Rec. 6993 (March 20, 1969). "
1196,66," This point was recognized in the ABA report on the proposed S.2048 and S.2049: Some of the conduct of organized crime in legitimate business can be . . . reached by the existing antitrust laws . . . .  Other 
activities of organized crime in legitimate business may or may not be subject to antitrust laws.  Thus some extortion tactics 
and business take-overs by organized crime might not be reached under the antitrust laws, particularly if they affected only 
the victimized business rather than resulting in a lessening of competition in an entire line of commerce . . . ."
1196,*," * * By placing the antitrust-type enforcement and discovery procedures in a separate statute, a commingling of criminal 
enforcement goals with the goals of regulating competition is avoided. On the other hand, by inserting in the Sherman Act a provision which does not have as its primary objective the 
establishment or maintenance of free competition, may result in an undesirable blending of otherwise laudatory statutory 
objectives.  Criminal conduct which violates existing antitrust laws can be proceeded against under those laws.  Additional 
conduct sought to be reached should be attacked under separate legislation."
1196,115, Cong. Rec. 6995 (emphasis added). 
1198,67," It was this language in Landmark which led me to conclude in Kimmel that a ""racketeering injury is indistinguishable from a 
competitive or commercial injury."" See Kimmel, 565 F. Supp. at 494. Upon further reflection, it seems that a competitive injury is 
one type of racketeer enterprise injury."
1198,68," The defendants in Schacht apparently raised an argument similar to the racketeer enterprise injury, reasoning that the injuries 
did not stem from the operation of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering, but rather, only from the commission of the 
predicate acts.  The Schacht court found to the contrary and did not specifically resolve whether a valid RICO claim could be 
stated where the only actual injuries resulted from the underlying acts of fraud.  711 F.2d at 1358-59. However, the court 
reiterated that ""RICO was designed to protect, direct, and not just second order victims of organized crime infiltration . . . ."" 
Schacht, id. at 1358. (emphasis in original).  In light of this statement and given the court's general rejection of both ""competitive"" 
and ""indirect"" injury requirements, the court would almost have to veto the racketeer enterprise injury requirement.  See also 
Bunker Ramo v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 1288 (7th Cir. 1983) (adopting approach taken in Hellenic Lines 
allowing recovery for direct injuries).  The requirement that the injuries be something more than that flowing from the predicate 
acts, forecloses most, if not all, actions for direct injuries.  Interestingly, of the five courts to interpret Schacht on this point, three 
different results were reached.  See e.g., County of Cook v. Midcon Corp., 574 F. Supp. 902 at 919 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (Schacht 
does not foreclose interpretation that plaintiff must suffer racketeering injury apart from commission of predicate acts); Haroco, 
Inc. v. American National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, 577 F. Supp. 111, 114-15 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (same); Jensen v. E.F. "
1199,," Hutton & Co., Inc., [Current]Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P 99,674 at 97,713 (C.D. Cal. 1984) (Schacht rejected racketeer enterprise 
injury); Windsor Assoc., Inc. v. Greenfeld, 564 F. Supp. 273, 278-79 (D. Md. 1983) (Schacht rejected notion that injury 
something more than commission of two predicate offenses within two years through an enterprise); Austin v. Merrill Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 570 F. Supp. 667, 669 (W.D. Mich. 1983) (following Schacht -- does not decide the issue).  Assuming, 
without deciding, that a racketeer enterprise injury was required, the Austin court formulated a novel way to uphold the RICO 
claim.  The predicate acts relied upon in this securities fraud case were mail and wire fraud.  The criminal mail and wire fraud 
statutes do not require misrepresentation, reliance or injury -- all of which were pled by plaintiff.  The court concluded that 
""insofar as these allegations raise matters not contained in criminal mail and wire fraud charges, they allege injury arising out of 
the pattern of racketeering and not the commission of predicate offenses."" Austin, 570 F. Supp. at 669. This analysis suggests 
that as long as there is some factor involved in addition to the elements of the predicate offense, an appropriate RICO injury is 
alleged.  However, the court does not explain how the existence of misrepresentations or reliance adds to the injury suffered.  
This result was probably possible only because the plaintiffs in Austin did not rely upon the securities fraud as a predicate 
offense."
1199,69," Other explanations of this concept have been offered.  The Bennett court suggested that the racketeer enterprise injury 
requirement may actually test the sufficiency of the enterprise element.  Bennett, 685 F.2d at 1059 n.5. In a similar vein, the 
court in Slattery queried whether it represents the largely discredited requirement that the enterprise be separate and distinct 
from the acts of racketeering. Slattery, slip op. at 10-11. "
1200,70," The one arguable exception to this rule is Gitterman v. Vitoulis, 564 F. Supp. 46 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), where the court appeared to 
find the racketeering enterprise injury element satisfied.  However, the injury in that case was nothing more or different than that 
arising from the commission of the predicate acts.  Defendants in Gitterman represented themselves as members of a carpet 
cleaning service, using their access to plaintiffs' apartments as an opportunity to appropriate diamonds.  Although the court 
mentioned the need to show a racketeering enterprise injury, there was virtually no analysis of the actual injury sustained.  The 
court simply noted that the ""thefts . . . were part of a pattern of criminal activity and systematic fraud . . ."" and concluded that ""the 
type of scheme to combat, i.e., the infiltration of legitimate businesses by organized crime."" Gitterman, 564 F. Supp. at 49. The 
injury in Gitterman was the loss of the stones, which arose from the predicate acts of theft.  The decision may be reflective of the 
fact that criminal conduct, rather than ""garden variety"" commercial fraud, was involved.  Indeed, many courts appear to treat 
RICO in general and the racketeer enterprise injury in particular, with the same analysis employed in the obscenity area -- they 
know it when they see it!  See Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 12 L. Ed. 2d 793, 84 S. Ct. 1676 (1964) (Stewart, J., 
concurring).  At least two courts have actually cited to Justice Stewart's famous phrase in order to explain their view of RICO.  
See Willamette Savings & Loan v. Blake & Neal Finance Co., 577 F. Supp. 1415, 1430 (D. Ore. 1984); Waste Recovery Corp. v. 
Mahler, 566 F. Supp. 1466, 1468 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). "

preliminary injunction is being denied, denial on the Exchange Act claims is without prejudice. Plaintiff may, if it can, show that its 
Exchange Act claims are not moot or that other claims exist with respect to the Amended Offer. Because the expiration date of

Thus, for example, in Grumman Corp. the Second Circuit found that the target company had standing if it could show a ""threat to

portion of the market to which M & H sold modified racing tires. These figures strongly suggest that limiting the relevant market 
to the four tracks that adopted the rule at issue here was clearly wrong. "
1282,7," At argument counsel for M & H said: If you decide that all drivers have to race on identical tires, and identical in every respect, you probably need something like 
a single tire rule.  And the reason is that although it's perfectly possible to have very detailed specifications for the 
construction of the tire, or the width, or the height, or the tire stagger, or the number of times you change a tire, or whether 
you're permitted to use special left side and right side tires, those things, which are problems in this area, can all be 
addressed by simple straightforward rules.  But if you decide in advance that every driver has to race on exactly the same 
tire, you probably need a tire rule because as my client conceded and as most people familiar with this concede, the one 
step in tire manufacturing, the compounding -- the adding of the rubber compound to the carcass -- is a sort of a black art.  
And there isn't any quickly available tool to compare compound one with compound two as they come to the track. . . . 
Specifying one manufacturer is probably the only way that you can ensure that everybody races on the identical compound."

1285,9," The record contains testimony which shows that Hoosier did not have a monopoly on being designated for use under tire rules.  
The president of M & H testified that his company had been used as a track tire at several race tracks in 1979, 1981 and 1982.  
The following testimony from the promoter at Seekonk shows that even at a single track different companies supplied tires for 
use under tire rules in different classes of racing. A The modified class was on the Hoosier budget slick, the 13-inch and the Pro-stocks were on a Hoosier 11-inch economy 
slick.  The street class had been on the same tire for five to six years.  It is a recap tire supplied by Commercial Tire 
Company.  The mini-stock competitors chose to use a used Goodyear.  ""Scrub tire"" is what they call it.  That is a slightly 
used tire that was imported, used on formula racing, and it has been available through them at a much-reduced cost.  So I 
agreed to let them stay on that tire that was available to them. Q Now, sir, directing your attention to the Pro-stock class, when did you first institute a one-brand, one-tire rule in that 
class? A 1978. Q What brand of tire was the designated tire in that division in 1979, 1980 and 1981? A McCreary 9-inch slick. The record reveals that discussion of and experimentation with tire rules was a widespread phenomenon.  Not only were racers 
in classes other than modified using tire rules, but such rules were considered as early as 1972 by various groups as one way to 
control costs and increase parity. "

v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., No. 82-914 (March 20, 1984).  We do not believe the Supreme Court's opinion changes our holding 
and the substance of our opinion in this case.  This case continues to be governed basically by Sylvania. See the last paragraph 
in footnote 6 of the Supreme Court's Spray-Rite opinion.  However, reference to that Spray-Rite opinion should be made for the 
latest Supreme Court statements on certain antitrust aspects which are involved in this case "
1302,3," At the same time it should be recognized that the U.S. Supreme Court has ""failed to articulate with any degree of precision a 
definition of 'group boycott'."" Ron Tonkin Gran Torino v. Fiat Distributors, Inc., 637 F.2d 1376, 1382 (1981) [referring to criticisms 
of Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959)]. "
1303,4," The inclusion of Ronald L. Hirshberg, President of Hirsh Sailing Yachts, Inc., as a defendant does not establish a conspiracy 
under section 1 of the Sherman Act. A corporation cannot conspire with itself.  It acts through its officers whose communications 
with each other are those of the corporation.  See Hackett v. Metropolitan General Hospital, supra; Antitrust Adviser ยง 1.11 (C. 
Hills 2d ed. 1978). "
1304,5,"  Oreck as a whole, however, is severely criticized by Professor Liebeler as showing ""no understanding of the basic economic 
issues involved."" Antitrust Adviser 191 (Supp. 1983).  As further discussed in section B(2)(a) below, we agree with his criticism 
of another part of Oreck which, while finding no antitrust liability under the facts of that case, seems to say that if the purpose of 
an agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to eliminate a competitive dealer is to enable the surviving dealer to 
maintain intrabrand prices, a per se violation is involved.  579 F.2d at 131. As Liebeler says, this is the type of conduct Sylvania 
meant to be judged under the rule of reason. Antitrust Adviser ยง 2.20 (Supp. 1983) at 190."
1304,6," For a discussion of reasoning behind the point that unlawful group boycotts require the participation of more than one 
participant on the same distribution level, see Note, Vertical Agreements to Terminate Competing Distributors, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 
1160 (1979). "
1305,7," There would also be at least arguable merit in using the literal approach to decide that the conduct alleged here is not a price 
restriction.  The only problem Professor Liebeler appears to find with the literal approach is that it would be inconsistent with 
""Sylvania's injunction to determine the scope of the per se rule and the rule of reason on the basis of demonstrable economic 
effect rather than formalistic line drawing."" Antitrust Adviser 233-34 (Supp. 1983).  However, Sylvania's definition of per se 
violations in its footnote 16, quoted supra, itself seems to recognize the necessity for at least some line drawing in separating 
conduct which should and should not be labeled as per se violations. Footnote 16 notes that certain types of commercial "
1306,," conduct may not always ""fit the generalization"" as to whether or not they have social utility and points out that the inclusion of 
certain types of conduct within the per se rule is a ""judgment"" made ""to provide guidance to the business community."" The literal 
approach to per se violations is referred to in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 8-9, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 1556-57, 60 L. Ed. 
2d 1, (1979), in a way which would not seem to exclude its use in interpreting the term ""price restrictions"" in footnote 18 of 
Sylvania. Broadcast Music says that even literal price fixing is not necessarily a per se violation. Accordingly, it could be argued 
that, a fortiori, conduct like that alleged in the case before us, which is certainly less price oriented than literal price fixing, should 
not be per se unlawful.  Also, justification for the literal approach could be found in Justice Powell's dissent in Arizona v. 
Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 357, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 2480, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 67 (1982). Justice Powell 
expresses the view that particular arrangements may be per se violations when they have no ""procompetitive economies,"" a 
term which he uses interchangeably with ""competitive efficiencies."" 457 U.S at 362-63, 102 S. Ct. at 2482-83, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 70. 
It seems plain that dealership terminations can bring about those economies and efficiencies.  See Muenster where the Fifth 
Circuit said that defendant manufacturer ""merely tried to improve its distribution efficiency by reducing intrabrand competition."" 
651 F.2d at 298. "
1311,8,"  In Sweeney the Third Circuit said that its opinion in Cernuto did not hold that when a manufacturer terminates a distributor 
because of a complaint from another distributor concerning price cutting, those actions constituted a section 1 claim without 
other proof of concerted action.  Sweeney found that under those circumstances there still must be other proof of an unlawful 
conspiracy in order to support a per se violation. But the Cernuto type of approach continues to be followed in Spray-Rite, supra, 
and Battle v. Lubrizol Corp., 673 F.2d 984 (8th Cir. 1982). The Sweeney approach seems to be followed in Schwimmer v. Sony 
Corp. of America, 677 F.2d 946 (2d Cir. 1982). As Schwimmer says, ""[A] manufacturer's mere receipt of complaints from its 
wholesalers or agents who compete with plaintiff, or its consultation with such other competing wholesalers, standing alone, 
[does not] support a finding of conspiracy with them."" 677 F.2d at 953. Thus, some federal cases have receded from the Cernuto 
approach.  There has developed a split as to whether evidence of a conspiracy other than evidence of a dealership termination 
following a request from another dealer for that termination is required for per se liability.  Sweeney and Schwimmer say yes.  
Spray-Rite and Battle say no.  See Justice White's dissent to the denial of certiorari in Schwimmer, 459 U.S. 1007, 1008, n.1, 
103 S. Ct. 362, 363 n.1, 74 L. Ed. 2d 398,     n.1 (1982). But even Sweeney and Schwimmer, in contrast to the case before us, 
involved apparently stronger cases for antitrust liability because in those cases other competing dealers, i.e., more than one 
other competing dealer, allegedly conspired to cause a dealership termination. "
1312,9," As noted above in the opening ""Summary"" portion of this opinion in our supplemented quotation of the Antitrust Adviser's 
statement of the Sylvania holding, Sylvania reverts to pre-Schwinn case law which we believe, in pertinent part, is accurately 
represented by the foregoing quotation from the monograph as describing lawful conduct. "

1322,1," Malley-Duff also alleged violations of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act and ยง 7 of the Clayton Act. Because Malley-Duff has not appealed 
the adverse directed verdict as to these counts, we do not address them here. "
1325,2," In the view we take it is unnecessary to consider the alternative rule of reason theory advanced by plaintiff at trial.  Moreover, 
from our treatment of the antitrust issue here, a conclusion must necessarily follow that there was sufficient evidence to go to the 
jury on the common law conspiracy issue, thus rejecting contentions presented by Crown Life and Lloyd. "
1326,3," The verdict form, with the jury's responses noted by an ""X,"" provides in relevant part:"

1328,6,"  For example, the court instructed the jury: The other type of conspiracy is one involving the use of unlawful means, which is 
found whenever there is a combination of persons or entities to do acts with the intent to injure another. Thus, a conspiracy which charges use of unlawful means does not require the use of illegal or tortious methods. What it does require is that the participants act in concert with the intent to injure another. In this case, the plaintiff claims that all of the defendants conspired against it with the intent to injure plaintiff. App. at 2537a-38a. "
1329,7," Appellee-cross appellants also argue that Malley-Duff failed to establish the fact of damage.  In view of our disposition of this 
case, we do not reach this issue.  We note, however, that to the extent Malley-Duff shows, on remand, that loss of its business 
was caused by the unlawful acts of defendants, the fact of damage is established. "
1332,1," One of the two motions for summary judgment has been filed by all defendants except Wenner Ford Tractor, Inc. and John S. 
Wenner. The other motion for summary judgment has been filed by defendants Wenner Ford Tractor, Inc. and John S. Wenner. "
1333,2," In addition to selling Ford tractors, Tunis Brothers sold Ford accessories and non-Ford products. For the period of time from 
1977 to 1981, Tunis Brothers' sales of Ford products as compared with its total sales ranged from a high of 65.8% in 1979 to a 
low of 46.2% in 1981. See Plaintiffs' Amended Answers to Defendant Ford Motor Company's Interrogatories; Plaintiffs' Trial 
Exhibit P-102."
1333,3," A 1974 franchise agreement between Ford and Richard and Isabelle Tunis remained in effect, without interruption, and 
governed the parties' relationship after 1974."
1333,4," Wenner Ford is a participant in Ford's Dealer Development program.  This program permits Ford and another party to invest in 
a dealership with the understanding that the other party will buy out Ford's investment within a reasonable time and thus become 
a privately capitalized dealer.  The terms of the Dealer Development Agreement in this case included, inter alia, that Ford would 
be the sole preferred stock shareholder of Wenner Ford and that John Wenner would be the sole common stock shareholder. 
Only the preferred shares are capable of being voted under terms of the Agreement. See Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibits P-163, 164. "
1334,5," A fair reading of Counts I, III and IV reveals the following distinctions among these counts. Count I sets forth a per se violation 
of section 1 of the Sherman Act and is based on the alleged conspiratorial conduct of defendants. Count III of the complaint is 
the same as Count I except for the additional allegation that defendants' conspiracy included ""dirty business tricks and unfair 
business dealings."" Count IV is the same as Count I with the exception that in Count IV plaintiffs do not allege a per se violation 
of section 1 of the Sherman Act but rather, allege that defendants' conspiratorial conduct violated the rule of reason."

1335,7, See note 5 supra.
1335,8," By Order dated June 22, 1983, this court dismissed all claims against another named defendant, C. W. Wenzel, for lack of 
personal jurisdiction. Tunis Brothers Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., No. 82-5557 (E.D. Pa. June 22, 1983)."
1335,9," This rule prohibiting a conspiracy from being based on acts between a corporation and its employees does not, of course, 
preclude a conspiracy predicated on acts by the employees and some non-employee or entity other than their own corporation. 
Thus, for example, it is possible that a conspiracy could be formed between John Wenner and a Ford employee. "
1336,10," Plaintiffs contend that this conversation is their principal evidence of Ford Credit's conspiratorial behavior (Tr. 49). The court 
determines that this is the only evidence which purportedly shows Ford Credit's participation in the alleged conspiracy."
1336,11," Saxton Deposition, pp. 23-24; Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit P-73."
1336,12," Although the first credit application submitted by de la Rigaudiere and Smith was denied, plaintiffs were permitted to submit a 
second application when it was determined that the first credit application had contained erroneous financial information. This 
second credit application was still pending with Ford Credit when Ford, through defendant Hasel, notified de la Rigaudiere and 
Smith that they would not be given a Ford tractor franchise in Kennett Square."
1336,13," The court also finds that there is no evidence which would support a finding that a Ford employee, but not acting on behalf of 
Ford, conspired with Ford Credit."
1336,14, See Tr. 28.
1336,15," In determining whether a section 1 conspiracy exists between Ford and John Wenner or Wenner Ford, the court is guided by 
the recent Supreme Court decision Monsanto Company v. Spray-Rite Service Corporation, 465 U.S. 752, 52 U.S.L.W. 4341, 79 
L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). In that distributor-termination case, the court held that in order to submit a section 1 claim 
to the jury, more than evidence of complaints from other distributors is needed. Id. at 4344. The evidence presented must tend to 
exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and non-terminated distributors were acting independently. Id."
1336,16, See Tr. 28-29; Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit P-62. 
1337,17, Tr. 31.
1337,18," In addition to these facts that are virtually all subjective, intangible or ambiguous, plaintiffs also cite the unambiguous fact that 
one of Wenner Ford's trucks was used in an attempt to repossess a Ford tractor from plaintiffs' dealership. However, even 
plaintiffs apparently concede that this incident is of little value in implicating Wenner in the alleged conspiracy. See Tr. 28-33."
1337,19," Although plaintiffs repeatedly note in the papers filed with the court that a number of Ford employees have simultaneously 
served as employees of Wenner Ford and Ford, plaintiffs only specifically refer to defendants Fraher and Hasel. Therefore, the 
court will examine the activities of only these two defendants as they relate to the alleged participation by Wenner Ford in the 
conspiracy. Fraher's and Hasel's involvement as directors and officers of Wenner Ford arises out of the terms of the Dealer 
Development Agreement in which Wenner Ford was a participant. See note 3 supra. "
1338,20," Complaint, para. 95."
1338,21," More specifically, the actual wording of the subject provisions gave Ford the right to terminate the arrangement between it and 
Tunis Brothers without notice if there was a transfer or an attempt to transfer any ownership interest in the dealership. Ford 
could terminate the arrangement at will provided the dealer was given at least sixty (60) days prior written notice. The franchise 
agreement also provided that any change in an ownership interest would be ineffective against Ford and that Ford could decline 
to appoint as an authorized dealer any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the dealership upon termination or non-renewal of 
the agreement. "
1344,1," This settlement agreement was the first to be negotiated by Pennsylvania. It contains a so-called ""most favored nations"" 
clause.  Because a lower settlement per vehicle was negotiated with Bud Haas Toyota, Inc., the original settlement figure of 
$9,500 was reduced to $8,000 in accordance with that clause. Although this Court does not find that inclusion of such a clause 
renders preliminary approval inappropriate, it notes that ""most favored nation clauses"" are generally considered undesirable. 
See Manual For Complex Litigation ยง 1.46. "
1345,2," The Court understands that plaintiffs also intend to move for dismissal of Henry Kehl Enterprises, Inc., a Pennsylvania Dealer, 
on the grounds that its Chapter 11 petition will soon be converted into a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. This Court will 
consider a motion for preliminary approval of dismissal at a later date."
1345,3," Although the Manual For Complex Litigation ยง 1.46 indicates the desirability of a preliminary hearing on the proposed 
settlements, this Court does not find such a hearing necessary in light of the preliminary hearings already held concerning the 
original Settlement Agreement. Compare In re General Motors Corporation Engine Interchange Litigation, 594 F.2d 1106, 1133 
(7th Cir. 1979). "
1347,4," Although the comparable provision to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2) in the parens patriae amendments to the Clayton Act provide for 
notice by publication of the pendency of parens patriae actions, unless the Court finds that such publication would not satisfy 
due process, it seems clear that Congress' intent in enacting this provision was to simplify the notice procedures in parens 
patriae actions. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 94-803, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 46 (1976). "
1351,1," HN1[
] ORS 646.725 provides: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to 
be illegal."""
1351,2," Plaintiff conceded during oral argument that the antitrust complaint did not state a claim under the Sherman Act, 15 USC ยงยง 1-
7 (1982); federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of those claims in any event.  15 USC ยง 4; see also, e.g., Miller v. Grandados, 
529 F2d 393, 395 (5th Cir 1976); Armstrong v. Taco Time Intern., Inc., 30 Wash App 538, 635 P2d 1114 (1981). Neither does 
plaintiff contend that the antitrust complaint stated a claim for relief under the common law governing unreasonable restraints of 
trade. "
1357,*," Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the National Conference of Bar Examiners by Kurt W. Melchior, Allan 
Ashman, and Jan T. Chilton; and for the State Bar of California by Henry C. Thumann, Herbert M. Rosenthal, Truitt A. Richey,

1358,1," Although petitioners represent only four of the seven members of the Committee at the time of the February 1974 bar 
examination, Ronwin named all seven members in his original complaint.  Apparently, three of the original defendants to this 
action did not join, for reasons not apparent, the petition for certiorari in this Court.  There is no claim that these members of the 
Committee failed to participate in or dissented from the actions of the Committee."
1358,2," The procedure in Arizona is not unique to that State.  In recent years, the burgeoning number of candidates for admission to 
practice law and the increased complexity of the subjects that must be tested have combined to make grading and 
administration of bar examinations a burdensome task.  As a result, although the highest court in each State retains ultimate 
authority for granting or denying admission to the bar, each of those courts has delegated to a subordinate committee 
responsibility for preparing, grading, and administering the examination.  See F. Klein, S. Leleiko, & J. Mavity, Bar Admission 
Rules and Student Practice Rules 30-33 (1978)."
1358,3," The parties disagree on the wording of the Rules at the time Ronwin took the bar examination. The disagreement centers 
around the effective date of some amendments promulgated in 1974.  Petitioners contend that the amendments took effect 
before Ronwin took the February 1974 bar examination; Ronwin submits that they became effective in March 1974.  Ronwin 
concedes that the Supreme Court order amending the Rules provided that the amendments would become effective in January 
1974.  Notwithstanding this directive, he argues that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 12-109 (1982) provided that amendments to the 
Supreme Court's Rules may not become effective until 60 days after publication and distribution.  Since the Supreme Court 
released the amendments on January 11, Ronwin submits that the earliest possible effective date was March 12. LEdHN[2B][
] [2B] Ronwin has misread ยง 12-109.  That section only applied to Rules that regulated pleading, practice, and procedure in judicial 
proceedings in state courts.  By its terms, the statute did not limit the jurisdiction of the Arizona Supreme Court to establish the 
terms of admission to practice law in the State.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 32-275 (1976)."
1358,4," Rule 28(a) provided: ""Examination and Admission. . . .  The examination and admission of applicants for membership in the State Bar of Arizona shall 
conform to this Rule.  For such purpose, a committee on examinations and admissions consisting of seven active members of 
the state bar shall be appointed by this court. . . .  The committee shall examine applicants and recommend to this court for "
1359,," admission to practice applicants who are found by the committee to have the necessary qualifications and to fulfill the 
requirements prescribed by the rules of the board of governors as approved by this court respecting examinations and 
admissions. . . .  The court will then consider the recommendations and either grant or deny admission."""
1359,5," According to Ronwin's complaint, the Committee announced before the February examination that the passing grade on the 
test would be 70, but it assigned grades using a scaled scoring system.  Under this system, the examinations were graded first 
without reference to any grading scale.  Thus, each examination was assigned a ""raw score"" based on the number of correct 
answers.  The Committee then converted the raw score into a score on a scale of zero to 100 by establishing the raw score that 
would be deemed the equivalent of ""seventy."" See n. 19, infra."
1359,6," Rule 28(c) VII B provided: ""The Committee on Examinations and Admissions will file with the Supreme Court thirty (30) days before each examination the 
formula upon which the Multi-State Bar Examination results will be applied with the other portions of the total examination 
results.  In addition the Committee will file with the Court thirty (30) days before each examination the proposed formula for 
grading the entire examination."" 110 Ariz., at xxxii."

1359,8," Rule 28(c) XII F provided: ""1. An applicant aggrieved by any decision of the Committee ""(A) Refusing permission to take an examination upon the record; ""(B) Refusing permission to take an examination after hearing; ""(C) For any substantial cause other than with respect to a claimed failure to award a satisfactory grade upon an examination; ""may within 20 days after such occurrence file a verified petition with this Court for a review. . . .

shall within 15 days of such service transmit said applicant's file and a response to the petition fully advising this Court as to the

this Court shall consider the papers so filed together with the petition and response and make such order, hold such hearings 
and give such directions as it may in its discretion deem best adapted to a prompt and fair decision as to the rights and 
obligations of applicant judged in the light of the Committee's and this Court's obligation to the public to see that only qualified 
applicants are admitted to practice as attorneys at law."" 110 Ariz., at xxxv-xxxvi. Under Rule 28(c) XII G, an applicant who wished to challenge the grading of an answer to a particular question first had to 
submit his claim to the Committee for review.  The applicant was entitled to request Arizona Supreme Court review only if three 
members of the Committee agreed with the applicant that his answer had not received the grade it deserved.  The Rule also 
provided that the court could grant or deny such a request in its discretion.  Id., at xxxvi-xxxvii. "
1360,9," The Arizona Supreme Court Rules instructed the Committee to give two examinations each year -- one in July and one in 
February.  Id., at xxxii."
1360,10," He also alleged that the Committee had violated his constitutional rights by refusing, after the grades had been released, to 
provide him with the questions and answers to the Multi-State portion of the examination."
1360,11," Rule 28(c) XII F 2 provides, with respect to the petition of an aggrieved applicant, that the Arizona Supreme Court ""shall 
consider"" the petition and response, and ""hold such hearings and give such directions as it may in its discretion deem best 
adapted to a prompt and fair decision."" 110 Ariz., at xxxvi.  Ronwin makes no claim that the court failed to comply with its Rules, 
although -- of course -- he disagrees with the court's judgment denying his petition.  Thus, the court's denial of his petition must 
be construed as a consideration and rejection of the arguments made in the petition -- including Ronwin's claim that the 
Sherman Act was violated."
1360,12," Also named as defendants were petitioners' spouses and the Arizona State Bar.  The District Court dismissed the suit as to 
these defendants and the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.  Ronwin v. State Bar of Arizona, 686 F.2d 692, 694, n. 1 (CA9 
1981). Ronwin challenged this aspect of the Court of Appeals' opinion in a conditional cross-petition for certiorari.  We denied the 
cross-petition.  Ronwin v. Hoover, 461 U.S. 938 (1983)."
1360,13," The averment of a Sherman Act violation in Ronwin's complaint is as follows: ""The aforesaid conduct [the ""scoring system or formula,"" see n. 4, supra], which the Defendants entered into as a conspiracy or 
combination, was intended to and did result in a restraint of trade and commerce among the Several States by artificially 
reducing the numbers of competing attorneys in the State of Arizona; and, in further consequence of said conduct, Plaintiff was 
among those artificially prevented from entering into competition as an attorney in the State of Arizona and thereby further 
deprived of the right to compete as an attorney for the legal business deriving from or involving the Several States of the United 
States, including Arizona."" App. 10-11. The adequacy of these conclusory averments of intent is far from certain.  The Court of Appeals, however, found the complaint 
sufficient.  Accordingly, we address the ""state action"" issue. "
1361,14," The District Court also denied Ronwin's motion requesting the trial judge to recuse himself.  The Court of Appeals held that the 
District Court had not abused its discretion in denying the motion.  686 F.2d., at 701. We declined to review that finding.

1361,16," The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court should give Ronwin the opportunity to show that petitioners' actions 
sufficiently affected interstate commerce to fall within the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act. Petitioners did not seek review of this 
holding. "
1362,17," This case does not present the issue whether the Governor of a State stands in the same position as the state legislature and 
supreme court for purposes of the state-action doctrine."
1362,18," Ronwin does not dispute that regulation of the bar is a sovereign function of the Arizona Supreme Court.  In Bates v. State Bar 
of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 361 (1977), the Court noted that HN4[
] ""the regulation of the activities of the bar is at the core of the 
State's power to protect the public."" Likewise, in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 792 (1975), the Court stated: ""The 
interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of 
administering justice, and have historically been 'officers of the courts.'"" See also In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 722-723 (1973). 
Few other professions are as close to ""the core of the State's power to protect the public."" Nor is any trade or other profession as 
""essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice."""
1362,19," Ronwin's complaint, see supra, at 565, focuses on the grading formula as the means used to ""restrain competition."" He 
describes it as follows: ""The Defendants did not grade on a Zero to One Hundred (0 to 100) scale; rather they used a ""raw score"" system.  After the raw 
scores were known, the Defendants picked a particular raw score value as equal to the passing grade of Seventy (70).  Thereby "
1363,," the number of Bar applicants who would receive a passing grade depended upon the exact raw score value chosen as equal to 
Seventy (70); rather than achievement by each Bar applicant of a pre-set standard."" App. 10. Apparently Ronwin was trying to describe a ""procedure commonly known as test standardization"" or ""scaled scoring."" See Brief 
for State Bar of California as Amicus Curiae 7.  This method of scoring, viewed as the fairest by the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) for the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), see S. Duhl, The Bar Examiners' Handbook 61-62 (2d ed. 1980), published by 
The National Conference of Bar Examiners, is described as follows: ""In addition to the 'raw' scores (number of correct answers), ETS reports a 'scaled' score for each applicant.  In a series of tests, 
such as the MBE, which are intended to measure levels of competence, it is important to have a standardized score which 
represents the same level of competence from test to test.  The raw score is not dependable for this purpose since the level of 
difficulty varies from test to test.  It is not possible to draft two tests of exactly the same level of difficulty.  Scaled scores are 
obtained by reusing some questions from earlier tests which have been standardized.  A statistical analysis of the scores on the 
reused questions determines how many points are to be added to or subtracted from the raw score to provide an applicant's 
scaled score. Thus a particular scaled score represents the same level of competence from examination to examination."""
1363,20," Although the Court of Appeals recognized the similarity between this case and Bates, it found the facts in Goldfarb v. Virginia 
State Bar, supra, to be more analogous.  The court's reliance on Goldfarb was misplaced.  As the dissent of Judge Ferguson 
noted, Goldfarb involved procedures that were not approved by the State Supreme Court or the state legislature. In contrast, 
petitioners here performed functions required by the Supreme Court Rules and that are not effective unless approved by the 
court itself."
1363,21," Rule 29(a) of the Supreme Court of Arizona provided: ""The duties and obligations of members [of the Bar] shall be as 
prescribed by the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association. . . ."" "
1364,22," Following petitioners' request for a rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the parties debated whether and to what extent the 
Committee complied with this Rule.  For purposes of determining the application of the state-action doctrine, it is sufficient that 
the Rules contained an enforceable provision calling for submission of the grading formula. Moreover, the Rules contained a 
review procedure that allowed an aggrieved applicant to bring to the Supreme Court's attention any failure of the Committee to 
comply with the filing requirements in Rule 28(c) VII B.  The record reveals that Ronwin, in fact, alleged in his petition for review 
in the Arizona Supreme Court that the Committee had not filed its grading formula within the time provided in the Rule.  The 
court rejected the petition.  See supra, at 564."
1364,23," This procedure allowed a disappointed applicant to challenge ""[for] any substantial cause"" a Committee decision other than ""a 
claimed failure to award a satisfactory grade."" Rule 28(c) XII F 1(C).  As we have noted, Ronwin took full advantage of Rule 
28(c) XII F 1(C) in his challenge to the action of the Committee and the court.  See supra, at 564.  He did not, however, 
challenge the particular grade assigned to any of his answers."
1364,24," The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States as amicus, contends that our recent opinion in Community 
Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40 (1982), precludes a finding that the Committee's action was attributable to the 
Arizona Supreme Court.  Contrary to the Solicitor General's suggestion, our reasoning in Boulder supports the conclusion we 
reach today.  In Boulder, we reiterated the analysis of JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion in Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light 
Co., 435 U.S. 389 (1978). We noted that the state-action doctrine is grounded in concepts of federalism and state sovereignty.  
455 U.S., at 54. We stated that Parker did not confer state-action immunity automatically on municipalities, because the actions 
of a municipality are not those of the State itself.  455 U.S., at 53. Under our holding in Boulder, municipalities may be eligible for 
state-action immunity, but only ""to the extent that they [act] pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state 
policy."" Id., at 54; see also Lafayette, supra, at 411-412 (opinion of BRENNAN, J.).  Consistent with our reasoning in Boulder, 
our decision today rests on our conclusion that the conduct Ronwin complains of clearly is the action of the State.  Bates is 
explicit authority for this conclusion. "
1365,25," Our holding that petitioners' conduct is exempt from liability under the Sherman Act precludes the need to address petitioners' 
contention that they are immune from liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 
657 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961). LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] We also do not address Ronwin's contention that the Arizona method of limiting bar admissions violates the Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendments.  As Ronwin concedes, he made this argument for the first time in his response to petitioners' motion for rehearing 
in the Court of Appeals.  His failure to raise this issue in a timely manner precludes our consideration."
1365,26," The authority of the Arizona Supreme Court to determine who shall be admitted to the Bar, and by what procedure, is even 
more clearly defined than the role of that court in Bates.  In that case, State Bar Committee members were not appointed by the 
court, and the court did not expressly accept or reject each of the Committee's actions."
1365,27," Under Arizona law, the responsibility is on the court -- and only on it -- to admit or deny admission to the practice of law. This 
Court certainly cannot assume that the Arizona court, in the exercise of its specifically reserved power under its Rules, invariably 
agrees with its Committee.  Even if it did, however, it would be action of the sovereign."
1365,28," Even if Committee members had decided to grade more strictly, under the grading formula approved by the court, for the 
purpose of reducing the total number of lawyers admitted to practice, the court knew and approved the number of applicants.  
This was the definitive action.  There is nothing in the state-action doctrine, or in antitrust law, that permits us to question the 
motives for the sovereign action of the court. "
1366,29," The dissent recites the provisions of the Rules regulating the composition and origin of the Committee and notes that the 
Rules require the Committee to recommend qualified applicants to the Supreme Court.  Post, at 586.  The dissent does not 
mention, however, several critical provisions, summarized in the text infra, that articulate the Arizona Supreme Court's intent to 
retain full authority over, and responsibility for, the bar admissions process."
1366,30," The dissent states, post, at 591-592, n. 15, that we ""advanced the theory that the relevant 'state action'"" was the State 
Supreme Court's denial of Ronwin's postexamination petitions filed with the court.  (Emphasis supplied.) The dissent is 
inaccurate.  Our holding is based on the court's direct participation in every stage of the admissions process, including retention 
of the sole authority to admit or deny.  The critical action in this case was the court's decision to deny Ronwin admission to the 
Bar.  The dissent's suggestion that the Arizona Supreme Court never made this decision simply ignores Arizona law.  The 
Arizona Supreme Court has stated on several occasions that it, and not the Committee, makes the decision to admit or deny 
admission to applicants.  In Application of Burke, 87 Ariz., at 338, 351 P. 2d, at 171-172, the court stated: ""[It] is not the function of the committee to grant or deny admission to the bar.  That power rests solely in the Supreme Court. . . .  
The committee's bounden duty is to 'put up the red flag' as to those applicants about whom it has some substantial doubt.  If 
such doubt exists, then its recommendation should be withheld.  The applicant may feel that any questions raised as to his 
character or qualifications are without substance.  In such case, he may apply directly to this court for admission.  In the final 
analysis -- it being a judicial function -- we have the duty of resolving those questions, one way or the other. . . ."" (Emphasis 
supplied.) In a similar vein, the court stated in Application of Levine, 97 Ariz. 88, 92, 397 P. 2d 205, 207 (1964): ""If the committee fails to recommend the admission of an applicant, he may challenge the committee's conclusions by an original 
application to this Court. . . .  This Court will direct the committee to show cause why the applicant has been refused a favorable 
recommendation and on the applicant's petition and the committee's response, using our independent judgment, de novo 
determine whether the necessary qualifications have been shown."" See also Application of Kiser, 107 Ariz. 326, 327, 487 P. 2d 393, 394 (1971). Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed its responsibility as the final decisionmaker on admissions to the Bar.  
The dissent, relying on the absence in the record before us of a specific order of the court at the time Ronwin was not admitted, 
nevertheless would have us hold that the Committee rather than the court made the final decisions as to admissions and denials 
of the applicants who took the examination in February 1974.  If the dissent were correct, there would have been no valid action 
with respect to those who took that examination since, under Arizona law, the Committee had no independent power to act.  
Ronwin's complaint makes no such extreme averment, and certainly this Court will not assume that the Supreme Court of 
Arizona failed to discharge its responsibility.  Moreover, as we have noted, supra, at 576-577, Ronwin's claims were specifically 
rejected by the court. "
1367,31," It is true, of course, that framing examination questions and particularly the grading of the examinations involved the exercise 
of judgment and discretion by the examiners.  This discretion necessarily was delegated to the Arizona Committee, just as it 
must be unless state supreme courts themselves undertake the grading. By its Rules, the Arizona Supreme Court gave 
affirmative directions to the Committee with respect to every nondiscretionary function, reserving the ultimate authority to control 
the number of lawyers admitted to the Arizona Bar.  Ronwin avers a ""conspiracy to limit the number"" of applicants admitted.  He 
makes no claim of animus or discriminatory intent with respect to himself. Ronwin apparently would have us believe that grading examinations is an exact science that separates the qualified from the 
unqualified applicants.  Ideally, perhaps, this should be true.  But law schools and bar examining committees must identify a 
grade below which students and applicants fail to pass.  No setting of a passing grade or adoption of a grading formula can 
eliminate -- except on multiple choice exams -- the discretion exercised by the grader.  By its very nature, therefore, grading 
examinations does not necessarily separate the competent from the incompetent or -- except very roughly -- identify those 
qualified to practice law and those not qualified.  At best, a bar examination can identify those applicants who are more qualified 
to practice law than those less qualified."
1367,32," JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent states that ""[any] possible claim that the challenged conduct is that of the State Supreme Court is 
squarely foreclosed by Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773 (1975)."" Post, at 589.  At issue in Goldfarb was a Sherman 
Act challenge to minimum-fee schedules maintained by the Fairfax County Bar Association and enforced by the Virginia State 
Bar.  In Goldfarb, state law did not refer to lawyers' fees, the Virginia Supreme Court Rules did not direct the State Bar to supply 
fee schedules, and the Supreme Court did not approve the fee schedules established by the State Bar.  To the contrary, the 
court ""directed lawyers not 'to be controlled' by fee schedules."" 421 U.S., at 789. Thus, even though the State Bar was a state 
agency, the Court concluded that ""it cannot fairly be said that the State of Virginia through its Supreme Court Rules required the 
anticompetitive activities of either respondent."" Id., at 790. As is evident from the provisions in the Arizona Supreme Court Rules, 
this case arises under totally different circumstances, although the relevant legal principles are the same.  The dissent's reliance 
on Goldfarb simply misreads the decision in that case."
1367,33," The dissent relies on Boulder, arguing that the ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy"" does not exist in 
this case.  Post, at 594-596.  What the dissent overlooks is that the Court in Boulder was careful to say that action is not ""exempt 
from antitrust scrutiny unless it constitutes the action of the State of Colorado itself in its sovereign capacity, see Parker, or 
unless it constitutes municipal action in furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state 
policy, see City of Lafayette. . . ."" 455 U.S., at 52. Thus, unlike the dissent here, JUSTICE BRENNAN in Boulder was careful to 
distinguish between action by the sovereign itself and action taken by a subordinate body. The dissent also cites Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579 (1976), and California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal 
Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97 (1980), as presenting situations analogous to the action of the Arizona Supreme Court.  This 
argument overlooks the fundamental difference between this case and the several cases cited by respondent.  In each of those 
cases, it was necessary for the Court to determine whether there had been a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state 
policy because the challenged conduct was not that of the State ""acting as sovereign."" Here, as we have noted above, the 
Arizona Supreme Court, acting in its sovereign capacity, made the final decision to deny admission to Ronwin.  See n. 30, supra. "
1368,34," The amicus curiae brief of the National Conference of Bar Examiners points out that many States have bar admission 
processes like those at issue in this case.  See Brief for National Conference of Bar Examiners as Amicus Curiae 1, 2, 8.  
Typically, the state supreme court is the ultimate decisionmaker and a committee or board conducts the examinations pursuant 
to court rules.  It is customary for lawyers of recognized standing and integrity to serve on these bodies, usually as a public duty 
and with little or no compensation.  See S. Duhl, The Bar Examiner's Handbook 95, 99 (2d ed. 1980).  In virtually all States, a 
significant percentage of those who take the bar examination fail to pass.  See 1982 Bar Examination Statistics, 52 Bar 
Examiner 24-26 (1983).  Thus, every year, there are thousands of aspirants who, like Ronwin, are disappointed.  For example, in 
1974 (the year Ronwin first took the Arizona bar examination), of the 43,798 applicants who took bar examinations nationwide, 
10,440 failed to pass.  44 Bar Examiner 115 (1975).  The National Conference of Bar Examiners, in its amicus brief, cautions 
that affirmance of the Court of Appeals in this case could well invite numerous suits.  It is no answer to say that, of course, such 
suits are likely to be frivolous.  Ronwin, who failed the bar in 1974, has been litigating his claim for a decade on the basis of a 
complaint that basically challenges the motive of the Arizona Committee.  His claim is that the grading formula was devised for 
the purpose of limiting competition.  If such an allegation is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, examining boards and 
committees would have to bear the substantial ""discovery and litigation burdens"" attendant particularly upon refuting a charge of 
improper motive.  See Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" after Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 451 (1981). Moreover, 
Ronwin has brought a suit for damages under the Sherman Act, with the threat of treble damages.  There can be no question 
that the threat of being sued for damages -- particularly where the issue turns on subjective intent or motive -- will deter ""able 
citizens"" from performing this essential public service.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814 (1982). In our view, as the 
action challenged by Ronwin was that of the State, the motive of the Committee in its recommendations to the court was 
immaterial.  We nevertheless think, particularly in view of the decision below, that the consequences of an affirmance should be 
understood.  The consequences of reversal by the Court today will have only a limited effect.  Our attention has not been drawn 
to any trade or other profession in which the licensing of its members is determined directly by the sovereign itself -- here the 
State Supreme Court. "

countries or traders from other English towns were prohibited from buying or selling in any way that might interfere with the 
interest of the gildsmen.  They must buy and sell at such times and in such places and only such articles as were provided by 
the gild regulations."" E. Cheyney, An Introduction to the Industrial and Social History of England 52-53 (1920)."
1369,3," ""The craft gilds existed usually under the authority of the town government, though frequently they obtained authorization or

without being subject to the organization which controlled that trade."" Id., at 55."

examination procedure is merely advisory and that the Arizona Supreme Court itself ""made the final decision on each applicant."" 
Ante, at 578 (footnote omitted).  Presumably petitioners are more familiar with how their own procedures work than is this Court.  
The Court shows precious little deference to ""administrative expertise"" in its analysis of the facts."
1372,13," It is not surprising that petitioners (who must practice before the Arizona Supreme Court) did not advance the theory on which 
this Court relies -- that their challenged conduct is actually conduct of the Arizona Supreme Court.  They surely understand that 
they are not the court, but rather its subordinate. "
1373,14," See also New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109 (1978); Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 
428 U.S., at 593-595."
1373,15," In response to this dissent, the Court has advanced the theory that the relevant ""state action"" was the State Supreme Court's 
rejection of an original complaint filed in that court containing a ""plethora of charges, including the substance of the complaint in 
this case."" Ante, at 576-577.  See also ante, at 582.  Presumably, that complaint was simply deficient as a matter of state law; if 
the allegations of respondent's current complaint are taken as true then the fact that respondent failed the bar examination 
would have provided an adequate ground for the dismissal of respondent's complaint without any review of respondent's 
allegations.  Even if it were the case that the Arizona Supreme Court reviewed petitioner's complaint on its merits, all that would 
indicate is that the court has declined to exercise its power of revision with respect to petitioners' alleged anticompetitive policies.  
That is far different from having required petitioners to adopt those policies in the first place, which is what Goldfarb requires."
1373,16," The Court argues that ""[only] the Arizona Supreme Court had the authority to grant or deny admission to practice in the State,"" 
ante, at 575-576 (footnote omitted), and therefore concludes that the challenged conduct is that of the court.  But there is no 
allegation that the challenged policy was adopted by the court; at most the court has permitted it by accepting the 
recommendations of petitioners.  Yet as Bates and Goldfarb make clear, the challenged policy must be required by the 
sovereign. The fact that the court retained the power to disapprove of the examination procedure adopted by petitioners is no 
different from the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court retained the power to disapprove of the fee schedules set by the bar 
association in Goldfarb.  Similar powers of revision were held insufficient to justify immunity in Lafayette, Cantor, and Midcal. "
1374,17," While the majority's disavowal in its note 30 is quite unequivocal, at other points in its opinion, see ante, at 576-577, and in its 
ultimate statement of its holding, see ante, at 582, it does seem to rely on the denial of respondent's petition for review.  If that 
truly is critical for the majority, then it would follow that an individual in respondent's position who did not file a petition for review 
would be able to mount an antitrust challenge free from the immunity barrier the majority erects.  If it indeed is that easy to 
escape the majority's holding, then that holding will not protect bar examiners against the parade of horribles discussed by the 
majority ante, at 580, and n. 34."
1374,18," The cases the Court cites ante, at 577, n. 30, 581, all involve instances in which an applicant who had passed the bar 
examination was nevertheless not recommended for admission.  If the applicant seeks judicial review, those cases indicate that 
the court will decide for itself whether to admit the applicant.  However, none of those cases indicates that the court makes an 
independent decision, or indeed any decision at all, to deny the application of a person who has failed the bar examination."

1375,20," See also Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S., at 604-605 (opinion of BURGER, C. J.).  In Cantor, the Court wrote: ""Respondent could not maintain the lamp-exchange program without the approval of the Commission, and now may not 
abandon it without such approval.  Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the option to have, or not to have, such a program 
is primarily respondent's, not the Commission's.  Indeed, respondent initiated the program years before the regulatory agency 
was even created.  There is nothing unjust in a conclusion that respondent's participation in the decision is sufficiently significant 
to require that its conduct implementing the decision, like comparable conduct by unregulated businesses, conform to applicable 
federal law.  Accordingly, even though there may be cases in which the State's participation in a decision is so dominant that it 
would be unfair to hold a private party responsible for his conduct in implementing it, this record discloses no such unfairness."" 
Id., at 594-595 (footnotes omitted)."
1375,21," In this Court petitioners appear to have abandoned the argument, advanced for the first time in a petition for rehearing in the 
Court of Appeals, that the examination grading formula was actually approved by the State Supreme Court.  Because the 
majority appears to revive this abandoned contention, ante, at 572-573, and n. 22, see also ante, at 576, it is necessary to 
address it, though that requires no more than brief reference to the Court of Appeals' opinion: ""Defendants contend for the first time on rehearing that the Committee's grading formula 'was submitted to the Court, reviewed 
by the Court, and accepted by the Court.' In response, Ronwin has tendered to this court what purports to be the letter the 
Committee filed with the Supreme Court on February 8, 1974 pursuant to Rule 28(c) (VII)(B).  If, as Ronwin alleges, the 
Committee scored the examination to admit a pre-determined number of applicants, the letter does not so advise the court.  
Accordingly, if the letter presented to us constitutes the submission to the Supreme Court, it cannot be the basis for a clearly 
articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy. Although dismissal might have been proper if the facts were as defendants 
now argue for the first time on rehearing, those facts were never brought to the district court's attention.  Dismissal was therefore 
improper on the basis of the information before the district court."" Ronwin v. State Bar of Arizona, 686 F.2d 692, 697 (CA9 
1981). It is, of course, equally improper for this Court to rely on evidence not presented to the District Court as a basis for holding that 
the complaint was not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.  See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157-158, n. 
16 (1970). "

of course would have a complete defense since in such a case they would have been delegated no power which could be used 
to restrain competition and hence cannot be liable for a restraint they did not impose.  Moreover, the Sherman Act protects the 
right to seek favorable legislation, even if the reason for doing so is to injure competitors.  See California Motor Transport Co. v. 
Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 
(1961). The majority's focus on cases not before the Court surely reflects the weakness of its position with respect to the case 
that is here."
1376,24," In order to preserve the secrecy of bar examination questions, the test must vary from year to year; after a test has been 
given, it may become apparent that the anticipated passing grade should be adjusted in order to provide roughly the same 
measure of competence as was used in prior years.  Thus respondent's burden of proving the conspiracy he has alleged 
requires far more than evidence that petitioners exercised discretion in setting the passing grade after the results were known. "
1377,25," The conspiracy respondent has alleged, if proved, would have no procompetitive justification at all; it would be plainly 
inconsistent with the goals of the Sherman Act. Thus petitioners' claim of antitrust immunity arises in the least defensible context: ""[As] a general proposition . . . state-sanctioned anticompetitive activity must fall like any other if its potential harms outweigh its 
benefits.  This does not mean that state-sanctioned and private activity are to be treated alike.  The former is different because 
the fact of state sanction figures powerfully in the calculus of harm and benefit.  If, for example, the justification for the scheme 
lies in the protection of health or safety, the strength of that justification is forcefully attested to by the existence of a state 
enactment. . . .  A particularly strong justification exists for a state-sanctioned scheme if the State in effect has substituted itself 
for the forces of competition, and regulates private activity to the same ends sought to be achieved by the Sherman Act. Thus, 
an anticompetitive scheme which the State institutes on the plausible ground that it will improve the performance of the market in 
fostering efficient resource allocation and low prices can scarcely be assailed."" Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S., at 610-
611 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment)."
1377,26," See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332 (1982); American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. 
v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556 (1982); National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679 (1978); 
Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341 (1963); American Medical Assn. v. United States, 317 U.S. 519 (1943); 
Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 465-466 (1941)."
1377,27," If, as seems likely, respondent's claim proves insubstantial, it should be dealt with in the same manner as other such claims -- 
by means of summary judgment, perhaps coupled with an award of attorneys' fees should it also develop that this case was 
""unreasonably and vexatiously"" brought.  See 28 U. S. C. ยง 1927. "
1383,1," Winterland states that the motion to dismiss should have been converted to a motion for summary judgment because it 
appended materials outside the record to its motion, specifically, an affidavit by one of its attorneys.  The affidavit makes 
reference to Trela's appearance before the district court at the preliminary injunction hearing, a fact obviously known to the 
district court.  It further cites the court to other cases in which it successfully obtained temporary restraining orders against 
""bootleggers."" The material presented in the affidavit could quite properly have been presented in Winterland's brief to the district 
court.  We do not agree, therefore, that the district court was required to convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary 
judgment. "
1384,2," Trela's First Amendment claim was premised on his production of the ""Roc Rags"" line of T-shirts, which he claimed were 
newspapers.  The district court found as a matter of fact that they were shirts, not newspapers, and Trela does not appear to 
press this claim on appeal."
1384,3," Trela also claims that his employees, not parties to this lawsuit, were ""illegally arrested"" and ""falsely imprisoned."" "
1385,4," Winterland points to its success in obtaining temporary restraining orders as evidence that its claims were not shams. As 
Professor Areeda has noted, ""If the antitrust defendant's claim was successful in the other forum, there is a strong presumption 
that its assertion cannot have been a sham."" Areeda, Antitrust Law, 1982 Supp. para. 203.1.d.  However, since TRO's can be 
obtained ex parte, we do not consider Winterland's success in obtaining them dispositive. "
1393,1," The agreement, in part, provided: IT IS MUTUALLY COVENANTED AND AGREED AS FOLLOWS: First: Licensor hereby grants to licensee, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, a non-assignable, non-exclusive 
license to use said system in the operation of one Holiday Inn on the following described specific site: Existing 173 room (keys) Inn located at 1111 Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112 known now and to 
continue to be operated as ""Holiday Inn-Superdome"". It is further understood and agreed that the Licensor has, and shall continue to have during the life of this license 
agreement . . . the right to construct and operate one or more Holiday Inns at any place other than on the site licensed 
hereby. Second: Licensee does acknowledge and recognize . . . that this license is not exclusive; that licensor is enabled in 
accordance with the provisions hereof, to construct and operate, or permit to be constructed and operated by other license 
applicants, additional Holiday Inns anywhere except at the site licensed hereby . . . (emphasis added). "
1394,2," The record is not clear on exactly how many rooms the two company-owned Holiday Inn hotels together contained, but 
evidently the total is between 345 and 426.  The record also is unclear about how many hotel rooms exist in downtown New 
Orleans, but evidently the total is between 10,000 and 11,605.  Consequently, Holiday Inns owned between 2.97% and 4.26% of 
the hotel rooms in downtown New Orleans. "
1395,3, See supra note 1.
1395,4, The Superdome Hotel did not allege that Holiday Inns breached its fiduciary relationship when it terminated the franchise. 
1396,5," HN6[
] The one arguable exception to the general rule that a corporation cannot conspire with its own employees in violation of section 1 occurs in the rare instances in which employees have an independent personal stake in achieving the object of the 
conspiracy.  Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 470, 82 S. Ct. 486, 489, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962). The 
Superdome Hotel has not alleged, nor do the facts uncovered in discovery suggest, that the exception might apply in this case. "
1397,6," Thus, we need not determine when a wholly owned but separately incorporated subsidiary is an entity capable of conspiring 
with its parent.  See Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 726-27 (7th Cir.1979) cert. denied, 445 U.S. 917, 100 S. 
Ct. 1278, 63 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1980). The Supreme Court recently heard oral argument in the case of Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., (No. 82-1260; argued Dec. 5, 1983), involving the intra-enterprise conspiracy issue of whether a 
corporation can conspire with its wholly owned, separately incorporated subsidiary in violation of section one.  We base our 
decision in this case on the uncontested fact that Holiday Inns and the Chateau LeMoyne are parts of a single entity. Thus, our 
opinion should not be affected by the Supreme Court's holding in the Copperweld case. "
1398,7," Holiday Inns rebuts the Superdome Hotel's argument by noting that Holiday Inns competes with several other hotel chains in 
New Orleans that offer Holidex-type services.  These hotels include Hilton, Marriott, Ramada Inn, LaQuinta, Rodeway Inn, 
Travel Lodge, Best Western and Howard Johnson.  This rebuttal argument suggests that a relevant submarket may exist 
comprised of rooms served by computerized, nationwide, toll-free reservations services.  The Superdome Hotel, however, did 
not pursue this issue in district court, in its brief filed with this court, or at oral argument.  Consequently, we do not address it.  
See First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289-90, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 1593, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)."
1398,8," The Superdome Hotel relies on the case of Heatransfer Corp v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 979-81 (5th Cir.1977), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S. Ct. 1282, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792 (1978) for the proposition that it is entitled to have a jury decide if 
the relevant market is Holiday Inn hotel rooms.  Its reliance on this case is misplaced.  In the section two and section seven 
violations alleged in the Heatransfer case, the single-brand market involved was not the product marketed by the plaintiff, i.e., air 
conditioners, but the single brand or brands of products marketed by the plaintiff's customers, i.e., Volkswagen, Porsche, and 
Audi automobiles.  Id. at 971. Such a situation in which one large customer-manufacturer creates a market is materially and 
analytically different from the present case in which one large seller allows different types of outlets to sell its products in a 
market in which many brands compete for customers."
1398,9," Courts also have recognized an exception when one firm's product has total market dominance, as opposed to a monopoly 
over its own brand, so that any action to increase control over the market is inherently anti-competitive. See Spectrofuge, 575 
F.2d at 282 (more detailed explanation; citations included). "

General Dynamics for the proposition that a defendant may rebut a prima facie showing of probable anti-competitive effect 
based on market and concentration statistics by showing that the statistics do not accurately reflect the probable effect of the 
merger or acquisition on competition.  418 U.S. at 631, 94 S. Ct. at 2874, 41 L. Ed. 2d at 1001. See also Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation v. F.T.C., 652 F.2d 1324, 1336-37 (7th Cir.1981) (discussing General Dynamics in context of other section 
seven cases).  The concentration of the affected market in Marine Bancorporation was high -- three banks controlled 92.3% of 
the relevant market. The target company held 86.6% of the market, and the acquiring company held none of the actual market, 
but was a significant potential competitor.  418 U.S. at 606-09, 94 S. Ct. at 2862-63, 41 L. Ed. 2d at 987-88. Apparently the 
market share and market concentration data was ""inherently suspect"" within the meaning of Philadelphia National Bank. "

1410,2," General Laws c. 231, ยง 118, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 65, HN1[
] provides in relevant part: ""A party aggrieved by an 
interlocutory order of a trial court justice in the superior court department . . . granting . . . a preliminary injunction . . . may appeal 
therefrom . . . subject to the provisions of section ten of chapter two hundred and eleven A, to the supreme judicial court, which 
shall affirm, modify, vacate, set aside, reverse the order or remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate order as 
may be just under the circumstances."""
1410,3," General Laws c. 94, ยง 322, as amended by St. 1983, c. 96, ยง 1, HN3[
] provides, in part: ""Every beverage container sold . . . 
in the commonwealth shall have a refund value of not less than five cents."""
1410,4," Although the bottle bill prescribes a handling fee of at least one cent a container, the Secretary of Environmental Affairs, 
charged with administering the law and promulgating regulations to effectuate its purposes, G. L. c. 94, ยง 326, has mandated 
that the handling fee should be two cents a container. 301 Code Mass. Regs. ยง 4.05(2) (1983). "
1411,5," The distributors were required to pay two cents a can, fifty-eight cents a case of refillable bottles, and fifty-three cents a case of 
nonrefillable bottles."
1411,6," However, the price increases of all but one of the defendants declined substantially as of June, 1983, while the prices of some 
of the distributors who are not CRINC shareholders have continued to increase. "
1412,7," In this order the judge clarified certain bases for the previously imposed injunction. Relevant to our analysis of his order, the 
judge determined that the defendants' refusal to pay the statutorily mandated two cent handling fee should be enjoined because 
this action contravenes the Legislature's collection scheme which gives dealers an incentive to return empty beverage 
containers to the distributors. According to the judge, the burden that this injunction may have on the defendants in escalating 
their cost of doing business and on the market price of beer must be counterbalanced by the strong public policy concerns which 
arise because aspects of the defendants' activity may violate the Antitrust Act and the bottle bill. On May 11, 1983, a different judge of the Superior Court allowed, in part, the defendants' joint motion to dismiss those portions 
of the Attorney General's complaint seeking money damages for retail consumers.  The judge ruled, inter alia, that the Attorney 
General was barred from bringing a parens patriae action on behalf of indirect purchasers.  See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 
U.S. 720 (1977)."
1412,8," The order was amended on September 2, 1983, to reflect the correct date of the order by the Superior Court judge which 
stayed the injunction. "
1413,9," Since we conclude that some of the defendants' activities probably constituted violations of the State Antitrust Act, we need not 
reach the Commonwealth's claims that these activities were also violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act as 
raised in its amended complaint.  See G. L. c. 93A, ยงยง 1-11.  Nor do we reach all the issues raised relative to the alleged 
violations of the bottle bill.  See G. L. c. 94, ยงยง 321-327. "
1414,10," Federal courts have interpreted Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, to mean that HN10[
] when a government agency acts under its 
own authority to restrain statutory violations, a demonstration of irreparable harm is not a prerequisite to injunctive relief since 
the likelihood of a statutory violation implies that the public interest is adversely affected.  See Commodity Futures Trading 
Comm'n v. Muller, 570 F.2d 1296, 1300 (5th Cir. 1978); SEC v. Management Dynamics, Inc., 515 F.2d 801, 808-809 (2d Cir. 
1975). State courts also have held that an injunction should issue where a State agency which is authorized to restrain violations 
of laws has shown the existence of such a violation, and that irreparable injury need not be demonstrated as a separate 
prerequisite to relief.  See Arizona State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Hyder, 114 Ariz. 544, 546 (1977). Cf.  Independent School 
Dist. No. 9 of Tulsa County v. Glass, 639 P.2d 1233, 1237 (Okla. 1982) (case involved denial of permanent injunction); Semke v. 
State ex rel. Okla. Motor Vehicle Comm'n, 465 P.2d 441, 445 (Okla. 1970) (case involved granting of preliminary injunction). "
1415,11," By contrast, the Court has applied a rule of reason to evaluate the legality of other types of trade restraints under ยง 1 of the 
Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.).  Under this standard, ""[t]he true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed . . . merely regulates 
and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it . . . may suppress or even destroy competition."" National Soc'y of 
Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 691 (1978), quoting Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 
238 (1918)."
1415,12," See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra at 224 (competitors' agreement to engage in buying of surplus gasoline in 
spot market to escalate and maintain product's market price constitutes unlawful price-fixing under per se rule); National Soc'y of 
Professional Eng'rs v. United States, supra at 692-693 (per se unlawful price-fixing occurred when competing engineers agreed 
to refuse discussing prices until after potential customers selected engineer for project)."
1415,13," Although the record shows that the defendants ceased imposing the commingling charge as of June 2, 1983, this would not 
preclude the judge from enjoining any subsequent charges of this sort.  In addition, the chairman of CRINC stated, in an 
affidavit, that CRINC would continue to monitor commingling and to reimpose the charges if the amount of commingled cans 
substantially increased. "
1416,14," The evidence showed that a portion of the defendants' increased beer prices in January, 1983, reflected the costs they 
incurred in operating CRINC.  The harm to consumers in paying the increased prices would appear, as a practical matter, to be 
incapable of remediation through money damages, given the decision of the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 
U.S. 720 (1977). The Court refused to allow indirect purchasers to sustain a treble damages claim against the defendants, 
although the direct customers of the defendants could seek monetary relief from the defendants' unlawful activities in restraint of 
trade.  Id. at 730-731. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 (1976).  The Court recognized that limiting relief under the treble damages provision 
to direct purchasers could preclude deserving indirect customers from showing actual damages suffered from an unlawful price 
overcharge.  Id. at 731 n.11."
1416,15," CRINC is currently providing the recycling bags to dealers at a small loss, since it charges only the price which CRINC paid for 
them, without adding on handling and shipping charges.  The additional cost to CRINC, each month, of supplying these 
receptacles free of charge would total $ 16,875."
1416,16," There exists a substantial factual dispute concerning the efficiency and convenience of CRINC's pick-up services which is not 
resolved entirely by the conflicting affidavits presented by the parties.  The bulk of the Commonwealth's evidence is in the form "
1417,," of ""John Doe"" dealer reports to investigators for the Attorney General.  The defendants' evidence is comprised of personal 
affidavits from numerous dealers who have done business with CRINC and have expressed satisfaction with the collection 
service.  While there is support in the record for a finding that the CRINC schedule makes it less convenient for some dealers, 
the judge, on remand, may deem it appropriate to take evidence on the question before entering any final orders on this point.  
See SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486, 491 (2d Cir. 1968) (where sharp dispute exists as to crucial facts, judge should conduct 
hearing to illuminate factual issues and not order injunction based on affidavits); Sims v. Greene, 161 F.2d 87, 88 (3d Cir. 1947) 
(conflicts in allegations of affidavits and pleadings on motion for injunctive relief should be resolved by oral testimony).  Cf.  
Ross-Whitney Corp. v. Smith Kline & French Laboratories, 207 F.2d 190, 195, 198 (9th Cir. 1953) (preliminary injunction may be 
granted solely on affidavits, at least where no dispute concerning basic facts).  HN14[
] We uphold the preliminary injunction 
since there is an adequate showing of a violation of the regulation issued pursuant to the statute.  See FTC v. Rhodes 
Pharmacal Co., 191 F.2d 744, 747-748 (7th Cir. 1951) (where injunction authorized by statute, court need only find justifiable 
basis to believe statute violated; injunction thus may issue on affidavits which do not resolve factual issues).  Thus, in any further 
evidentiary hearing on this issue, the defendants would have the burden of proving that CRINC's collection schedule did not 
make container recovery less convenient for dealers than acceptance at the time of delivery of filled containers. Cf.  Wheeler v. 
Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., 347 Mass. 730, 734 (1964) (burden of proof on party alleging that he was within 
statutory exemption)."
1417,17," HN15[
] An agreement between competitors to refuse to deal with other traders consistently has been regarded as an 
unreasonable restraint on trade under the per se rule.  See Silver v. New York Stock Exch., 373 U.S. 341, 347 (1963); Klor's Inc. 
v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 212 (1959); 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1, 2 (1976); G. L. c. 93, ยง 4. "
1418,18," There is therefore insufficient evidence to support the Commonwealth's claim that the defendants monopolized, or attempted 
or conspired to monopolize, the beverage container recovery market in this regard.  See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 
U.S. 563, 576 (1966) (challenged business conduct must be shown to impair opportunities of competitors in relevant market); 3 
P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law par. 625, at 72 (1978) (HN16[
] unlawful monopoly exists if defendant has power to 
control prices or unreasonably restrict competition in any part of trade or commerce)."
1418,19," Furthermore, even assuming, as some evidence demonstrated, that CRINC may have refused to pick up from redemption 
centers any brands which their clients (the defendants and the non-shareholder distributors) did not sell, under the bottle bill the 
defendants were obligated only to accept returns of the type, size, and brand that they sold during the past sixty days.  
Redemption centers would have to return the other types, sizes, and brands to distributors who were required under the law to

1425,2, L. Comp. R. 3.01 provides: 
1436,1," The original Selectron case was filed in 1976. Following the ruling in Phonetele v. AT&T, 435 F.Supp. 207 (C.D.Cal. 1977), this 
court dismissed Selectron on the grounds that (1) the FCC had exclusive jurisdiction and (2) the Federal Communications Act "
1437,," conferred an implied antitrust immunity.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed both cases for reasons stated in Phonetele 
Inc. v. AT&T, 664 F.2d 716 (1981)."
1437,2," Business offices typically employ one or both of these systems. The chief characteristic of the key system is that it enables the 
user of one phone to connect communications to several other individual telephones by pressing buttons on the base of the 
phone. A PBX system is similar but operates on a larger scale. A PBX system employs a central console that allows the user to 
switch communications to as many as several thousand individual telephones."
1437,3," The PCA device was to serve as a 'network control signaling' device to prevent wrong numbers, false busy signals, and 
incorrect billings and as a 'connecting arrangement' to enable the connection of private equipment to the AT&T telephone 
network."
1437,4," In footnote 39 and the associated text of United States v. AT&T, 461 F.Supp. 1314, 1327 (D.D.C. 1978), the court explained 
the FCC's view of accepting a tariff with and without approval. Since tariffs often become effective without the Commission's 
""scrutiny or approval, the courts appropriately exercise antitrust jurisdiction. . . . The Commission considers, however, that when 
it has prescribed or specifically approved a tariff, its judgment must control . . ."" "
1438,5," Litton's claims of monopolization and anticompetitive conduct were, for the most part, identical to those claims set forth in the 
Selectron complaint."
1438,6," Pretrial proceedings consumed four and a half years. Trial lasted five months and generated 18,000 pages of testimony and 
945 exhibits.  Plaintiffs allege that AT&T spent $65,000,000 in defense."
1438,7," In a special verdict the Litton jury found that AT&T possessed monopoly power in the terminal telephone equipment market; 
AT&T had specific intent to obtain and attempted to obtain such monopoly power; and that AT&T filed the interface tariffs in bad 
faith, opposed certification in bad faith, intentionally delayed the installation of PCA devices, refused to sell inside wiring in bad 
faith, and delayed making cutovers in bad faith. "
1439,8, It is evident that AT&T had every incentive to vigorously litigate its case in Litton and did so. This issue is not contested.
1439,9," AT&T does not contest this issue. I find that the Selectron plaintiffs did not take a 'wait and see' approach in the instant action.  
If Selectron had not been subjected to appellate proceedings, it may have been tried prior to Litton. See note 11, supra. "
1440,10," See footnote 1, supra."
1440,11," Some of AT&T's evidence on this issue related directly to Oregon and Washington state regulatory policies. AT&T not only 
cross-examined Selectron's president on this issue in the Litton trial but in addition, entered into evidence several Oregon Public 
Utility Commission decisions. Litton Exhibits DX 572-1, 572-3, 572-6."
1440,12," Judge Connor made several references to AT&T's state action defense in his instructions. Among those references include the 
following: In determining whether defendants had monopoly power in the relevant market . . . one factor, among others, for you to 
consider is the extent of government regulation of certain activities of AT&T and the Bell operating companies, including the 
fact that these companies submit tariffs to certain regulatory agencies, including the FCC in connection with various 
aspects of their telecommunication business. The fact that such regulation exists does not by itself mean that defendants 
did not possess monopoly power. It is for you to determine the practical effect of such regulation upon Bell's asserted ability 
to control prices and exclude competition. Bell contends that this government regulation effectively precluded them from possessing the power to control prices or 
exclude competition. Litton contends that this regulation has no significant impact upon Bell's ability to control prices and 
exclude competition. You should consider these contentions and the evidence you have seen and heard regarding 
government regulation as a fact in determining whether the defendants had monopoly power. "

1441,13," The three jury findings included (1) AT&T's attempted monopolization proximately caused plaintiff's injury; (2) AT&T filed the 
interface tariffs in bad faith; and (3) AT&T delayed in making equipment cutovers in bad faith. "
1442,14," The Restatement (Second) Judgments, ยง 29(5) and comment (g) (1982), warns against giving collateral estoppel effect to an

1443,18," Litton's application of the doctrine is in accord with the Ninth Circuit's position on this matter. If anything, the Ninth Circuit 
interprets the sham exception more broadly than other circuits. See Clipper Exxpress, supra; See also In re Airport Car Rental,

1444,21," For instance, the government did not introduce testimony of the Chairman of the PBX Advisory Committee indicating 
intentional delay in the development of a certification program."
1444,22," The Court notes that AT&T used these decisions throughout the Litton trial in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the jury that 
its tariff was not filed in bad faith. These decisions were used in examining witnesses, marked as exhibits, received into 
evidence, and read to the jury. Judge Connor specifically referred to them in delivering his instructions to the jury. "

1452,1," The trial court's own finding that the ""record is void of evidence"" concerning the actual or probable effect of the alleged group

jurisdictional nexus was overlooked. "
1481,*," Honorable John W. Peck, Senior Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1482,1," The district court also granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on the issues of (1) whether plaintiffs were damaged in fact by 
the tie-in (490 F. Supp. at 1117-19) and (2) whether the tie-ins were justified by legitimate business considerations ( id. at 1120-
24). We agree with the court's rulings on these issues and the grounds upon which the court based them. "
1483,4," HN4[
] Since the requisite economic power may be found on the basis of either uniqueness or consumer appeal, and since market dominance in the present context does not necessitate a demonstration of market power in the sense of ยง 2 of the 
Sherman Act, it should seldom be necessary in a tie-in sale case to embark upon a full-scale factual inquiry into the scope of the 
relevant market for the tying product and into the corollary problem of the seller's percentage share in that market.  This is even 
more obviously true when the tying product is patented or copyrighted, in which case, as appears in greater detail below, 
sufficiency of economic power is presumed. "
1485,2," There was documentary and oral testimony that RDOS was the best in the industry, the most comprehensive, compatible, field 
proven, and rapid.  One customer testified, for example, that tests showed RDOS ran approximately four times faster than any 
similarly-priced system.  Another witness called it ""the only full service operating system available for the NOVA."""
1485,3," One of defendant's officers admitted it would be impossible to develop operating system software performing all the functions of 
defendant's RDOS without violating defendant's copyright and utilizing its trade secrets. "
1486,4," Defendant's former marketing manager could recall no instance in which an existing OEM customer had abandoned 
defendant's equipment and switched to a new supplier.  Competitors and customers of defendant testified that conversion was 
virtually impossible without a complete rewriting of application software. One OEM estimated the cost of conversion to be 90 
percent of the original development costs.  Another ruled out the possibility of changing operating systems because ""it would 
simply take too long to change all the software that we have, all the software on hand.  We can't shut down the operation we 
have going. . . ."" And another, ""it is just not possible to do in our environment because it would just take forever."" "
1487,5," The district court suggested that ""the presumption of economic power may be inappropriate in the computer software context 
because copyright notices do not necessarily prevent others from copying the material embodiment of the source program."" 529 
F. Supp. at 816. The premise of this position was laid to rest in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Inter'l., Inc., 725 F.2d 521 (9th 
Cir. 1984); and Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1249-54 (3d Cir. 1983), decided after the

1489,6," One of defendant's customers stated the Fairchild NOVA instruction set CPU was ahead of its time technologically but he had 
to eliminate it from consideration because Fairchild ""did not have an operating system available."" Another customer testified the 
SCI Mercury 3 emulator was superior to Data General's NOVA CPU.  The record is rich in testimony from customers who stated 
the tie prevented them from purchasing any CPU other than Data General's. "
1490,7," Our conclusion that the verdict for plaintiffs should be reinstated disposes of defendant's appeal from the dismissal of 
defendant's counterclaim alleging this and other similar suits were ""sham litigation"", the institution of which constituted a violation 
of the Sherman Act. "
1494,1," Metro Center is a named defendant in this case, but is not a party to this appeal. "
1495,2," The district court granted summary judgment on all claims, apparently including the actions brought under the Iowa 
Competition Law.  The appellants do not specifically challenge the dismissal of the state claim, rather they contend the district 
court erred in holding the state action doctrine was applicable here."
1495,3," Other Supreme Court decisions have further refined the Parker state action doctrine.  E.g., Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 
U.S. 350, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 97 S. Ct. 2691 (1977); Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141

1497,5," Section 403.6 enumerates the powers delegated to municipalities. Iowa Code Ann. ยง 403.6 (West 1976).  Section 403.12 
enumerates the powers granted to public bodies, id. ยง 403.12, which includes political subdivisions of the state, id. ยง 403.17(3).  
Thus, the powers included in both sections are delegated to the state's municipalities, although section 403.6 specifically 
addresses municipalities."
1497,6, Iowa Code Ann. ยง 403.2 (West 1976) provides in pertinent part:
1497,1," .  It is hereby found and declared that there exists in municipalities of the state slum and blighted areas, as herein defined, 
which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of 
the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, 
constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce 
tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing 
accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the 
improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blighted areas is a matter of state 
policy and state concern * * *. "
1498,7," In addition to the general grant of all powers ""necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions 
of this chapter,"" section 403.6 specifically empowers municipalities, among other things, to carry out urban renewal projects; to 
make and execute contracts; to disseminate slum clearance information; to contract for the repair and furnishing of all services 
and facilities for or in connection with an urban renewal project; to acquire any real or personal property for administrative 
purposes and to hold, improve, clear or prepare such property for development; to encumber or dispose of any real property; to 
invest urban renewal project funds; to obtain money from the federal, state or county government; to make all necessary surveys 
and planning; to plan for the relocation of people and businesses; to appropriate funds; to levy taxes; to zone and rezone any

1499,9," Because we find state action immunity shields the defendants in this case, we need not discuss possible immunity under the

1500,10," The appellants contend the ordinances infringed on their fundamental right to receive just compensation for a taking.  We think 
that the appellants' taking claim should stand or fall on its own merit, rather than serve as a back door for other constitutional 
challenges. "
1501,11," The appellants question whether the city's proffered rationale is the real reason the city passed the ordinance. As long as a 
rational basis exists, however, it need not be the real reason for the governmental action to satisfy substantive due process.  
See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 490, 99 L. Ed. 563, 75 S. Ct. 461 (1955)."
1501,12," The appellants have belatedly asserted the vested rights theory to this Court as a separate cause of action.  This theory is a 
matter of state law not actionable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. See Nemmers v. City of Dubuque, 716 F.2d 1194, 1197 (8th Cir. 
1983)."
1501,13," The appellants do not allege in either their complaint or their amended complaint that they spent any money preparing their 
land for commercial development. Scott's deposition contains some reference to expenditures made to prepare a plat, but that 
was after the passage of the interim ordinance. Although the district court found these expenditures were significant enough to 
confer standing, see Scott v. City of Sioux City, No. C79-4009 slip op. at 4 (N.D. Iowa Dec. 17, 1982) (unpublished order), they 
are not sufficient to create a vested right under Iowa law.  See Nemmers v. City of Dubuque, supra, 716 F.2d at 1197-1198."
1501,14," At oral argument the appellants' attorney asserted that the city had promised the appellants commercial zoning when the land 
in question was annexed to the city.  The existence of such an agreement was not alleged before the district court, and we 
decline to consider it here. "

held that tying arrangements under the Sherman Act need only be condemned if they restrain competition on the merits by 
forcing purchases that would not otherwise be made. "
1509,3," The court in H.A. Artists noted in a footnote that ""even where there are union agreements with nonlabor groups that may have 
the effect of sheltering the nonlabor groups from competition in product markets, the Court has recognized a 'non-statutory' 
exemption to shield such agreements if they are intimately related to the union's vital concerns of wages, hours, and working 
conditions."" 451 U.S. at 716, n.19. "
1512,1," After the hearing the parties sent the Court for argumentative letter-briefs.  Neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the 
Local Rules provide for such post-hearing memoranda.  The Court welcomed the May 18, 1984 letter correcting the current 
status of the related action pending in state court and would likewise receive citations to authority decided subsequent to the 
hearing which materially affect the decision.  However, unsolicited arguments for which leave of file supplemental authority or 
argument was not obtained are improper and a waste of the Court's and parties' time. "
1515,2," While it is not contended that the Village of Pinehurst was a direct participant in the real estate market, it is alleged that the 
Village conspired in actions with other defendants that substantially affected interstate commerce. "

jurisdictional statement.  5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1206 at 77 (1969)."
1516,4," This is not a case where the complaint was drawn in a cursory and unacceptably conclusory fashion.  The Court recognizes 
that in antiturst cases facts necessary to the prosecution of an action are often ""largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators."" 
Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486,    , 7 L.Ed.2d 458, 464 (1962)."
1516,5," The fact that United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U.S. 271, 95 S.Ct. 2150, 45 L.Ed.2d 177 (1975) 
arose under section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18, is inconsequential since both sections are restricted to defendants ""in 
commerce."""
1516,6," The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act requires certain sellers or leasors of land who use facilities in interstate 
commerce in connection with the sale or lease of land covered by the Act to comply with its disclosure requirements. "
1517,7," This argument is shadowed by the market study conducted for Old Pinehurst which observed that the climate and golfing 
facilities of the Sand Hills area of North Carolina make it ""unique"" and not in competition with mountain or coastal recreational 
land sale projects.  Plaintiff's Memorandum, Attachment 1 (November 25, 1983). "
1529,1," I recognize, however, that this assumption is probably improbable, especially with respect to the claim that the defendants 
violated ยง 1962(a), which prohibits the direct or indirect investment of income, derived from racketeering activity, in an enterprise 
affecting interstate commerce. Whatever advantage Agency's ownership of Gateway stock may have given it in obtaining the 
financing necessary to purchase Econo-Car I, the ownership of that stock did not generate income, as that word is usually "
1530,," understood, until it was sold back to Gateway in February, 1981.  Therefore, I find it doubtful that agency can be said to have 
invested ""racketeering income"" in Econo-Car I."
1530,2," The issue has never been directly decided in this District. In Van Schaick v. Church of Scientology, 535 F. Supp. 1125 (D. 
Mass. 1982), the court held that ยง 1964(c) created a remedy only for persons injured in a business, as opposed to a personal, 
capacity.  Id. at 1137. The court suggested, in dicta contained in a footnote, that ยง 1964(c) requires ""in part"" a racketeering 
enterprise injury, but did not described that kind of injury. Id. n.11. In Spencer Companies, Inc. v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., Fed. 
Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) 98,361 (D. Mass. 1981), the court never reached the question presented here. "
