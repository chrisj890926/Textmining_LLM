24,1," The United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Judge Donald E. O'Brien presiding."
24,2," Because the case is before this Court on the district court's refusal to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), the facts well-pleaded 
by the plaintiff are deemed true.  Quality Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 542 F.2d 466, 468 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 433

26,4," Although the FCC has jurisdiction over Bell's activities in the interconnect area, North Carolina Utils. Comm'n v. FCC, 552 F.2d 
1036 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 874, 98 S. Ct. 222, 98 S. Ct. 223, 54 L. Ed. 2d 154 (1977), that is not sufficient to imply 
immunity. ""HN2[
] The Court has never held * * * that the antitrust laws are inapplicable to anticompetitive conduct simply 
because a federal agency has jurisdiction over the activities of one or more of the defendants."" Gordon v. New York Stock Exch., 
422 U.S. 659, 692, 95 S. Ct. 2598, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463 (1975) (Stewart, J., concurring), quoted in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 
U.S. 579, 596 n.36, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976)."
26,5," For a recent Eighth Circuit case discussing this issue, see National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross 
of Kansas City, Blue Cross Association, 628 F.2d 1050 (8th Cir. 1980). "
27,6," See the detailed discussion of the Act's history in Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tele. & Tel. Co., 610 F.2d 
1114, 1117-1120 (3d Cir. 1979). "
28,7," Bell claims that it required protective connecting arrangements because it did not know how otherwise to adequately protect the 
integrity of its equipment. The claim is a factual matter to be established at trial. The claim is relevant, if at all, only to the merits 
of the antitrust charges rather than to the claim of immunity. "
29,8," The word ""exemption"" is ""a shorthand expression for Parker's holding that the Sherman Act was not intended by Congress to 
prohibit the anticompetitive restraints imposed by California in that case."" Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 
389, 393 n.8, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978). "
31,9," The Court reiterated this requirement in New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 
2d 361 (1978). In that case, the Court held exempt from Sherman Act challenge a California statute requiring that new 
automobile dealerships within the market area of an existing franchisee must be approved by the New Motor Vehicle Board. "
33,10," Having disposed of these contentions, we necessarily reject Bell's claim that its marketing practices are immune because they 
are ""integrally related"" to the regulated conduct. Bell also contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the portion of 
Sound's complaint that alleged a denial of access to federal and state regulatory agencies. We find this contention to be without 
merit. See California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972). "

navigation systems, if needed, in the aircraft and the wiring of such equipment together, to the controls, and to the power source.  
An avionics system usually includes flight control, navigation, and communication subsystems.  The installation of interiors 
includes the design and installation of the seats, carpeting, and other interior items in the aircraft cabin."
37,4," .  Green aircraft are those new planes that are sold to customers without completed avionics and interior furnishings and that 
are therefore outfitted by independent companies.  Some models that are delivered green include Grumman Gulfstream I and II, 
JetStar I and II, Hawker-Siddley jets, Merlin, DC-9, 707, 727, some models of the Falcon, and various heavy-duty helicopters."

42,*, Represents only the first half of the year.
42,**, Two G-II's were outfitted in 1974 by Grumman for NASA's space shuttle program.
42,7, .  Avionics installation in a G-II requires approximately 6 months.
42,8," .  The G-II's green price was over $ 3,000,000.  Interior and avionics outfitting cost another $ 800,000 to $ 1,000,000, with the 
avionics package alone averaging, in 1973, about $ 595,000. "
43,9," .  At his deposition, Anckner stated that the loan was in the approximate amount of $ 1,000, that there was no particular due 
date, and no interest was discussed."
43,10," .  After the Associated-Page split, Associated began preparing a G-II outfitting facility at its Dallas base of operations and 
continued to bid on G-II avionics outfitting. However, it was unable to secure its first contract until late 1974 and only outfitted five 
green G-II's between mid-1973 and mid-1977.  In all, Associated received eight contracts after the arrangement with Page 
terminated. "
44,11," .  Defendants' evidence tended to show that an outfitter could get into the avionics business in as little as three months with an 
expenditure of only $ 30,000-50,000 and that numerous outfitters switched from one aircraft model to another with relative ease.  
On the other hand, Associated's evidence tended to show that it was very expensive and time consuming (plaintiffs' estimates 
ranged up to $ 3,000,000 and two and one-half years) to enter the G-II avionics installation market and that independent 
avionics installers do not install avionics in a variety of new aircraft at the same time. Further, there was no evidence that any 
new company besides Page had begun installing avionics in G-II's after 1969."
44,12," .  Now, before you consider the law relative to these violations, of Section 1, as well as defendants' alleged violations of Section 
2 of the Sherman Act, it will be necessary for you to determine the relevant market in this case.  Both plaintiffs' allegations 
concerning defendants' intention to eliminate each of them from competing as well as plaintiffs' allegations of violations of 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, are concerned with the amount of competition that has been foreclosed, so it will be necessary to 
define the market in which competition exists before you can determine if the competition within this market has been harmed at 
all or harmed not insignificantly.  Similarly, with regard to market, you must determine its existence before you can consider the 
issue of defendants' intent, if any, to eliminate plaintiffs from such market, if any. The relevant market consists of two dimensions: The geographic market and the product/service market.  Thus, in determining a 
relevant market you will be concerned with the questions of what product-service market is involved and who competed for sales 
in this relevant product/service market.  . . .  You will not have to find the relevant geographic market, . . .  as this fact has been 
stipulated by the parties.  You must however determine from a preponderance of the evidence the relevant product/service 
market, hereinafter called the ""relevant market."" The parties are in sharp dispute over what constitutes the relevant market. This 
dispute must be resolved by you in accordance with the instructions I am about to give you.  First, however, I want to summarize 
what the parties contend regarding the relevant market. Plaintiffs contend that the relevant market within which to judge the conduct about which they complain is the sale and 
installation of avionics in Grumman Gulfstream II aircraft. The defendants maintain that the relevant market is broader than the 
sale and installation of avionics in Grumman Gulfstream II only. The defendants submit that no such relevant market exists.  The 
defendants contend that the relevant market includes the installation of both avionics and custom interiors so far as any "
45,," particular aircraft is concerned and further, that the relevant market as such, includes the sale and installation of avionic 
equipment and systems, together with custom interiors, in a variety of business aircraft. In determining the relevant market you must consider the following factors: (1) The lack of reasonable interchangeability of use 
between the product and/or service itself and substitutes for it; (2) industry or public recognition of the relevant market as a 
separate economic entity; (3) the product's and/or service's peculiar characteristics and uses; (4) uniqueness of the production 
facilities required to manufacture or provide the product and/or services; (5) distinct customers of the product and/or services; (6) 
distinct prices for the product and/or service; (7) sensitivity to price changes and; (8) specialized vendors of the product and/or 
service. No one factor is necessarily decisive, but the more of these criteria that the particular relevant market fulfills, the more likely it is 
a separate product/service market. For the purpose of this case, it is immaterial whether you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the relevant market is a 
market or a submarket.  The relevant market may be either a market or a submarket.  The definition of the relevant market is 
crucial. If the relevant market is the broader definition defendants advance, it would not be possible for you to find that the 
defendants or any of them have violated the Sherman Act, as to which I will say, ladies and gentlemen, you may proceed to 
answer all of the issues based on the preponderance of the evidence and not just Issue Number 1 as to relevant market."
45,13," .  We hold in a later section of this opinion that Radio failed to prove that a market existed that was confined only to the sale of 
G-II avionics equipment to installers, and we also hold that Radio lacked standing to sue.  Those holdings, however, do not 
affect the validity of the jury's market finding regarding Associated's claims. "
47,14," .  See n. 6, supra.  Since most witnesses agreed that a firm must receive two or three G-II contracts per year to remain in the 
market, the G-II production rate (about 20 per year), without more, would itself tend naturally to limit the market to about seven 
firms."
47,15," .  See n. 16, infra."
47,16," .  In addition to a great deal of testimony on Page's intent to enter the market, Associated introduced an exhibit (plaintiffs' 
exhibit 42) consisting of handwritten notes taken by Juston of a meeting in late 1972.  The notes clearly show Page's 
contemplated entry, by means of a buyout or otherwise.  The notes also show Page's awareness of the two years required 
independently to develop engineering and STC's necessary to compete in avionics installations."
47,17," .  Our finding that Page was a probable entrant is not foreclosed by the fact that there had been no other new entrants since 
1969. No other company had Page's close ties with Grumman."
47,18," .  We are chary of placing too much emphasis on exact percentage figures regarding this market.  Although Page had garnered 
64% (7 out of 11) of all G-II outfittings in the first half of 1977, we note that a single plane can make an enormous difference in 
the percentages.  Thus, we prefer to view Page's share as substantially equal to Associated's pre-1973 share."
47,19," .  Contracts were introduced relating to the sale and outfitting of the last nine G-II's completed by Associated prior to September 
1, 1973.  The cost to the customer for total outfitting averaged just under $ 823,000 per plane, with the avionics outfitting price to 
the customer averaging $ 596,000, or 72%, of the total price. Associated's profit averaged about $ 52,000. Plaintiffs introduced evidence of the total outfitting prices to customers of nine G-II's outfitted by Page after 1973.  The average 
sale price was $ 1,010,220.  This reflects an average price increase to the customer of $ 187,600 per plane after Page entered 
the market.  While there was no testimony regarding the sales prices charged by Page for avionics alone, we note that 72% of 
the average total price is $ 727,358, a figure far higher than, the pre-1973 prices. Plaintiffs' expert testified that Page's net "
48,," avionics profit would average about 70% of the total price, or $ 117,667, on those nine post-1973 planes, a figure more than 
double the per plane profit enjoyed by Associated.  Of the nine sales of avionics by Page in evidence, six were installed in 
planes belonging to foreign governments; Page's avionics profits on these sales were even greater, averaging $ 158,417, more 
than three times the profit taken by Associated. Page complains that comparisons between its sales prices and profits and Associated's is meaningless because the price varies 
enormously with the amount of equipment ordered by the purchaser. However, Page did not introduce any evidence that the 
nine of its sales chosen by Associated to compare with Associated's sales and profits were nonrepresentative of its sales prices 
and profits generally."
48,20," .  Instruction 37: The requirement that the restraint of trade be unreasonable is referred to as the ""Rule of Reason"" test of 
illegality.  You are instructed therefore that ""restraint of trade"" as used in Section One of the Sherman Act applies only to 
unreasonable restraints and not to all possible restraints of trade.  The antitrust law seeks to maintain free competition in 
interstate commerce, in order to protect the public interest.  The end sought by the antitrust law is the prevention of 
unreasonable restraints in business and commercial transactions which tend to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise 
control or affect the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services; the public is to be protected in 
order to secure to them the advantages which accrue to them from free competition in the market.  Not all restraints of trade are 
unreasonable restraints.  All business affects trade in some way.  Therefore, in determining whether a ""restraint of trade"" exists, 
you must decide whether the conduct which you have found tends to restrict or otherwise control free and open competition.  
And in determining whether or not such an unreasonable restraint exists, you need not find a specific injury, but you must find 
that the conduct tends or is reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest. (Emphasis added)."
48,21," .  See n. 23, infra. "
49,22," .  Unfortunately, this will be cold comfort to one of the authors of the treatise, Donald Turner, who happens to be one of Page's 
able attorneys on appeal. "
50,23," .  We wish to emphasize that we have not held that any specific torts were committed.  We simply find that there was sufficient 
evidence for the jury to have found exclusionary conduct."
50,24," .  The court's charge on ยง 2 reads, in pertinent part: To monopolize means to unlawfully acquire monopoly power, that is, the power to control prices or to exclude competition in the 
relevant market. The first thing that characterizes a monopolist is the power to control prices.  A monopolist can control the price 
of its goods and force the sellers of like goods throughout the market to conform to its prices.  The second thing which 
characterizes a monopolist is the power to exclude competition from the market.  By ""power to exclude competition"" I mean the 
power to prevent other businessmen from opening and thereafter profitably engaging in the business involved or sufficient power 
over the customer's alternatives that other competitors can be excluded from competing in the relevant market. "
51,," It is not enough that one company is stronger and more successful than a competitor and may eventually drive a competitor out 
of business.  After all, all competition is a battle for trade, and in each sale one competitor must necessarily lose. It is only the power to exclude competitors from a market or control prices that violates the antitrust laws. Before you consider 
whether these defendants have monopoly power as stated in the previous paragraph, you must determine the relevant market 
applicable to this case pursuant to Instruction Number 39.  In determining if Page Airways and Page Gulfstream actually 
possessed the power to control prices or exclude competitors a most important factor is the size of the market share held by 
defendants.  The larger the market share of the defendant, the more likely that he will be able to control prices or exclude 
competition.  In addition, you may also consider the number and size of other competitors in the relevant market, the ease or 
difficulty with which new competitors may enter into the market, whether the market share of the defendants has increased or 
declined and whether competition in the market has become more or less concentrated, that is, whether the number of 
competitors is growing smaller while their market shares are growing larger. Before you can determine if defendants have violated Section 2, you must determine what is the relevant market pursuant to 
Instruction Number 39 as well as whether defendants possess monopoly power. If you find that defendants possess monopoly 
power, I caution you that this by itself is not sufficient to find an antitrust violation. Instruction 41.  The offense of monopolization under Section 2 has two elements: (1) The possession of monopoly power in a 
relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a 
consequence of a superior product, business acumen or historic accident.  In addition to the possession of monopoly power, you 
must also find, in order to hold that defendants violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that this power was willfully acquired.  The 
mere possession of monopoly power is insufficient to constitute an antitrust violation.  A company may grow very large and thus 
achieve some power to influence prices and competition in the market.  If the company achieves its power through purely 
legitimate means, that is, growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident, 
then it has not violated the antitrust laws. In this case, plaintiffs have argued that defendants' monopoly was acquired through a series of acts calculated to drive Plaintiff 
(Associated) out of the market. In response defendants deny that they have monopoly power, or, if they have it, they deny that such power was unlawfully 
acquired. Defendants further deny that any of their actions were done with an anticompetitive motive or by virtue of any 
agreement.  If you believe that the defendants' actions do not demonstrate a willingness or purpose to exclude competition or 
were not responsible for a monopoly, then you will not find that defendants have unlawfully monopolized in violation of Section 2 
of the Sherman Act. If, however, you believe defendants or any of them possess monopoly power and that such power was 
willfully acquired, you should find that such defendants have unlawfully monopolized in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Instruction 42: The offense of ""attempt to monopolize"" also has two essential elements: (1) Specific intent to monopolize; and (2) 
some act or acts done in furtherance of an intent to monopolize, which, although insufficient to actually produce monopoly power 
creates a dangerous probability that monopolization will occur.  In order to find an attempt to monopolize, both elements the 
intent and the act or acts must appear and together they must result in a dangerous probability that the defendant will achieve a 
monopoly of the relevant market. It is not necessary, however, in order to constitute an attempt to monopolize that the 
defendants' action actually succeed in achieving monopoly power. In deciding the question of whether there has been an attempt to monopolize, you are instructed that the phrase ""specific intent"" 
means more than merely an intention to engage in any act.  It means, therefore, plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that the defendants specifically intended to injure or destroy competition or control prices.  Accordingly, the evidence 
that any particular act was engaged in by the defendants would not be sufficient in and of itself on the issue of an attempt to 
monopolize unless you find that such act was done by reason of a specific intent to injure or destroy competition or to control 
prices. Instruction 43: As a general rule, it is reasonable to infer that a person ordinarily intends all the natural and probable 
consequences of acts knowingly done or knowingly committed.  With respect to the issue of intent, the jury is entitled to consider 
any statements made or acts done or omitted by defendants, and all facts and circumstances in evidence in the case which may 
aid determination of state of mind.  If you find that the defendants in their business practices were predominately motivated by 
legitimate business aims and that there was no specific intent to control prices or to injure or destroy competition in an 
appreciable part of trade or commerce, then you would find against the plaintiffs on the question of an attempt to monopolize. 
However, if you find that it was more likely than not that the defendants' actions were motivated by their desire to acquire "
52,," monopoly power by means other than free competition and if you find it more likely than not that there was a dangerous 
probability that monopoly would be achieved, then you would find in favor of the plaintiffs on an attempt to monopolize claim. Instruction 44.  With reference to the offense of conspiracy to monopolize, it is necessary for the plaintiffs to prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence that (1) there was a conspiracy; (2) the object and purpose of the conspiracy was or is to achieve 
monopoly power; and (3) that there was or is specific intent to injure the plaintiffs as well as competition.  I have already defined 
for you the meaning of a conspiracy in our discussion of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. That definition is applicable here. 
However, unlike Section 1, a conspiracy to violate Section 2 must be a conspiracy to obtain monopoly power, that is, the power 
to exclude competition or control prices rather than to merely restrain competition, as in Section 1. For the offense of conspiracy to monopolize, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the goal of monopoly power was or will be 
achieved."
52,25," .  If we had held that the issue of monopolization should not have been submitted to the jury, we could not allow the general 
verdict on section 2 liability to stand, even though there was sufficient evidence on attempt and conspiracy. See Sunkist 
Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co., 370 U.S. 19, 29-30, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 1135-1136, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1962); 
Smith v. Southern Airways, Inc., 556 F.2d 1347 (5th Cir. 1977); but see Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum 
Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1304 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972) 
(where the evidence was sufficient to create a jury question on monopolization, a verdict identical to the one at issue here could 
stand without our deciding whether the evidentiary requirements regarding attempts and conspiracies were met).  Even so, the 
damage award would still be supported by the jury's verdict on section 1 liability. "
53,26," .  See Eastern R. R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and 
United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
53,27," .  Instruction 52: This completes my instructions with respect to the antitrust law as it applies to this case.  There are, however, 
additional instructions of law which must be given which relate to whether some of the evidence introduced by plaintiffs really 
supports their antitrust claims.  For example, the plaintiffs claim that defendants filed, or caused to be filed, two legal 
proceedings in San Antonio with the intent to economically coerce the plaintiffs.  This is a serious allegation because the First 
Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees all of us the right to petition our government including the courts.  We 
would all, I am sure, be less likely to invoke our right to petition the court if the assertion of that right always carried with it the 
dangerous possibility that we would later be sued for asserting that right. However, the First Amendment does not shelter those 
who abuse the judicial process. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants abused the judicial processes in two ways.  First with respect to the legal proceeding 
whereby the defendants obtained from a state court judge in San Antonio an ex parte injunction which required Mr. Lanford to 
remove his camper from the Dee Howard hangar, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants caused the state judge to rule as he 
did by making material misrepresentations. A material misrepresentation is defined as a false representation made with the knowledge or belief on the part of the declarant 
that the representation is false with an intention to induce the court to act or to refrain from acting in reliance upon the 
misrepresentation and there is justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation on the part of the court in taking action or 
refraining from it.  If you find that the representations made to the San Antonio court by the defendants or any of them in 
inducing the court to issue an ex parte injunction were material misrepresentations under the above definition, then you must 
decide whether these material misrepresentations were made with the intent to economically coerce the plaintiffs. For your information, the term ""ex parte"" injunction action means, in this context, a judicial proceeding where action is taken or 
granted at the instance and for the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or contestation by any other person adversely 
interested. If you find that material misrepresentations were made to the court and that these material misrepresentations were made with 
the intent to economically coerce the plaintiffs, the fact that the defendants filed this ex parte injunction action would be evidence 
supporting plaintiffs' antitrust claims.  However, if you find that no material misrepresentations were made or, even if material 
misrepresentations were made, that they were not done with the intent to economically coerce the plaintiffs, then you must 
disregard completely the evidence presented to you with respect to the ex parte injunction action in San Antonio. Related to the ex parte injunction proceedings is an interpleader suit filed by the defendants against plaintiffs in San Antonio.  
Again, this interpleader proceeding is normally protected from scrutiny within the context of this lawsuit, by the First Amendment.  
You are instructed that an interpleader action is defined as follows: When two or more persons claim the same thing (or fund) of 
a third, and he, laying no claim to it himself, is ignorant which of them has the right to it, and reasonably believes he may be 
prejudiced by their proceeding against him to recover it, he may file a proceeding against them, the object of which is to make 
them litigate their claim between themselves, instead of litigating it with him and such an action is called an interpleader action.  
However, the plaintiffs again contend that defendants abused the legal process in filing this interpleader action.  Thus, plaintiffs 
say that this suit was not for the purpose of pursuing the legitimate purposes of an interpleader action but was filed with the 
intent to economically coerce the plaintiffs by tying up funds owed to them.  You are instructed that for the purpose of 
determining whether an abuse of process occurred in this interpleader action that an abuse of process means the intentional use 
of legal process for an improper purpose incompatible with the lawful function of the process by one with an ulterior motive in "
54,," doing so.  The only ulterior motive at issue here is the plaintiffs' allegation that the defendants were trying to economically coerce 
plaintiffs by tying up monies owed to them.  If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that this interpleader action was 
instituted not for the legitimate purposes of an interpleader suit as I have just defined it but for the purpose of economically 
coercing the plaintiffs then you may consider the filing of this interpleader action as evidence in support of plaintiffs' antitrust 
claims.  If you find to the contrary, you must disregard all evidence concerning the interpleader suit as it is protected from the 
scrutiny under the First Amendment. Instruction Number 54: The plaintiffs contend that defendants furthered their anticompetitive scheme through the practice of 
""commercial bribery."" There is a distinction to be made between commercial bribery of domestic corporations and citizens on the 
one hand and foreign officials on the other.  I want to instruct you first with respect to the law on domestic commercial bribery. ""Commercial bribery"" generally is a practice whereby one company obtains business by making secret payments to an 
employee of another company who in return steers business to the briber. Specifically, a commercial bribe is a secret payment 
made to an employee of one corporation for that employee's personal benefit by an employee of another corporation for the 
purpose of having the bribed employee use his influence to cause his corporation to favor the other corporation in preference to 
the other competitors. In our competitive system it is assumed that many companies will complete for business and will obtain 
that business based upon their own merit such as a superior product, lower price, and/or quick, efficient delivery and service.  
The practice of commercial bribery, however, distorts this competitive process as the business is awarded not on merit but 
through the corrupting of the buyer's employees.  If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that any or all of the 
defendants engaged in commercial bribery, this evidence would support the plaintiffs' antitrust claims. I further instruct you that a loan to an employee of a company from which business is obtained may or may not be a commercial 
bribe, depending upon the intent of the parties.  If the parties genuinely regard the transaction as a loan and intend that the 
money should be repaid, then no commercial bribe has occurred.  Finally if the defendants did not intend to offer to pay a 
commercial bribe, then you may not find that a bribe was made or offered even if you believe that the recipient of the favor took it 
to be a bribe. The intent of the parties in this case is a question which you must decide on the basis of the evidence presented to 
you. Instruction 55: Plaintiffs have also alleged that Page Airways, Page Gulfstream and Mr. Juston collectively or individually bribed 
Mr. Chapin and/or Mr. Hamilton and other of plaintiffs' employees. A bribe in this context again means that secret payment made 
to an employee of one corporation for that employee's personal benefit by an employee of another corporation with an improper 
or corrupt motive.  If you find that any one of the defendants bribed Mr. Chapin or Mr. Hamilton or any other of plaintiffs' 
employees, you must further decide whether it was for an anticompetitive purpose. You are further instructed that it is not improper for an employee to work for and accept money from two employers at the same 
time if both employers are aware that such a relationship exists and agree to that arrangement.  Moreover, it is not improper for 
an employee to make arrangements to compete with his employer before the termination of his employment, so long as he does 
not use his employer's time or any trade secrets in so doing and further that he does not breach his duty of loyalty to his present 
employer.  You are instructed that ""trade secrets"" means any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used 
in one's business and which gives one opportunity to obtain advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. You are instructed that it is undisputed that the plaintiffs and the defendants in this case were from 1968 until June, 1973, 
engaged in a cooperative venture whereby each played a role in the outfitting of planes for the mutual benefit of all.  It is entirely 
possible, therefore, that the employees of one would assist the employees of the other from time to time as the need arose in the 
furtherance of the joint effort.  This conduct alleged by the plaintiffs is not improper if the respective employers knew about the 
arrangement and gave it their consent. Furthermore, you may find that during the period from June of 1968 until June of 1973, when the agreement between the parties 
was in effect, that defendants paid employees of the plaintiffs money. Such conduct would not be improper so long as the money 
was paid for work done on the projects that both plaintiffs and defendants had a mutual interest in completing, and the money 
was not paid to encourage plaintiffs' employees to do acts detrimental to the interest of the plaintiffs.  However, you may find that 
the money was paid to encourage plaintiffs' employees to do acts detrimental to the interest of the plaintiffs, and this would fall 
under the definition of commercial bribery. Finally, you are instructed that after the agreement between the plaintiffs and defendants came to an end in June, 1973, there 
was a period of transition during which those who had previously worked together had to adjust their relationships.  If, therefore, 
you find that some employees of plaintiffs did work for the defendants because of an honest mistake as to their proper duties, or 
because of the confusion during the transition period or because such employees honestly believed they would be terminated by 
plaintiffs and did such acts, as they did, to further their own employment prospects with the defendants, this would not be "
55,," evidence in support of plaintiffs' claims unless you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendants encouraged or 
ratified this conduct. Instruction 57: Next, we come to the issue of foreign bribery. If you find that the defendants have engaged in commercial bribery 
of foreign government officials, this may be evidence of: (1) The willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power or; (2) an 
act performed in furtherance of an attempt to monopolize or; (3) an act performed in furtherance of a conspiracy to monopolize; 
or (4) an unreasonable restraint of trade.  However, before you may consider this as evidence of any or all of the foregoing 
antitrust violations you must find: (1) This foreign commercial bribery is not an accepted industry practice in the foreign market 
and is not illegal under the law of that foreign country which defendants must prove to you by a preponderance of the evidence 
and (2) it was not compelled by a foreign government or a foreign government official which defendants must prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence.  By ""compelled"" I mean that the ""foreign bribe"" is a cost of doing business in the particular 
country and failure to make the payments results in the competitor inevitably losing the business.  The fact that I have instructed 
you with respect to the foreign bribery issue does not mean that I have a view on the matter one way or the other or that foreign 
bribery has been established. The defendants contend that no foreign bribery occurred.  Their position is that it is ""quite common for a foreign government to 
deal through an intermediary when making a purchase of goods and equipment outside of its own country,"" and to pay 
commissions to that foreign intermediary is usual and legal. A bribe, on the other hand, is a secret payment made to foreign government official for that official's personal use and for the 
purpose of having that official use his official influence to cause his government to choose the briber's product over that of a 
competitor. The State of Sabah is governed by the laws of Malaysia.  Under Malaysian law it is a crime for a public servant to take 
gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.  The pertinent part of the statute reads: Article 161: ""Whoever, being or expecting to be a public servant, accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempt to obtain, from any 
person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification whatever, other than legal remuneration, as a motive or reward for 
doing or forbearing to do any official act, or for showing or forbearing to show, in the exercise of his official function favor or 
disfavor to any person, or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person, with the Government, or 
with any member of the Cabinet or of Parliament, or of a State Executive Council or Legislative Assembly, or with any public 
servant, as such, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both."" Explanation: Expecting to be a public servant.  If a person not expecting to be in office obtains a gratification by deceiving others 
into a belief that he is about to be in office, and that he will then serve them, he may be guilty of cheating, but he is not guilty of 
the offense defined in this section. Gratification: The word gratification is not restricted to pecuniary gratification, or to gratifications estimable in money. ""Legal Remuneration."" The words Legal Remuneration are not restricted to remuneration which a public servant can lawfully 
demand, but include all remuneration which he is permitted by law to accept. ""A motive or reward for doing."" A person who receives a gratification as a motive for doing what he does not intend to do, or as a 
reward for doing what he has not done, comes within these words. You are instructed that the law of Uganda is as follows: Any person employed in the public service who directly or indirectly agrees or offers to permit his conduct in such employment to 
be influenced by the gift, promise, or prospect of any property or benefit to be received by him, or by any other person from any 
person whomsoever is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for three years. Any person who endeavors directly or indirectly to influence the conduct of a person employed in the public service in respect of 
the duties of such employment by the gift, promise or prospect of any property or benefit to be received by such person 
employed in the public service, or by any other person, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for three years. Any person, who, being employed in the public services takes or accepts from any person for the performance of his duties as 
such officer any reward beyond his proper pay and emoluments, or any promise of such rewards, is guilty of a misdemeanor and 
is liable to imprisonment for three years. Any person who, being employed in the public service, receives any property or benefit of any kind for himself, on the 
understanding, express or implied, that he shall favor the person giving the property or conferring the benefit, or anyone in which 
that person is interested, in any transaction then pending, or likely to take place, between the person giving the property or "
56,," conferring the benefit, or anyone in whom he is interested, and any person employed in the public service, is guilty of a 
misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for six months. If plaintiff proves to you by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants bribed foreign officials in either Sabah or 
Uganda, then you must decide from a preponderance of the evidence whether this is an accepted industry practice in the 
relevant market. If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that this is not an accepted industry practice then you must decide whether 
defendants have proved from a preponderance of the evidence that the foreign government compelled these payments.  If 
defendants have not proved this defense then you may consider such ""foreign bribes"" as you have found as evidence of the 
various monopolization claims which you have already been instructed on. "
76,1," This case has been the subject of a number of previous decisions of this Court: United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., 93 
N.M. 105, 597 P.2d 290 (1979) (upholding trial court's refusal to stay its proceedings pending arbitration), cert. denied, 444 U.S. "
77,911," , 100 S.Ct. 222, 62 L.Ed.2d 145 (1979); United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., 91 N.M. 41, 570 P.2d 305 (1977) 
(upholding personal jurisdiction of trial courts), rev'd, General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 434 Atomic Co. v. Felter, 90 N.M. 120, 560 
P.2d 541 (1977) (upholding injunction prohibiting the parties from instituting related actions in other courts), rev'd General Atomic 
Co. v. Felter, 434 U.S. 12, 98 S.Ct. 76, 54 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977); and United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., 90 N.M. 97, 
560 P.2d 161 (1976) (upholding personal jurisdiction of trial court over GAC).  In addition, this Court refused to consider the 
issue of the disqualification of United's counsel as either an appeal from a final judgment or as a petition for an extraordinary writ 
(No. 11,469, June 29, 1977, and No. 11,484, July 1, 1977, respectively). In addition to the two decisions mentioned above which were taken to the United States Supreme Court, that Court has had this 
case before it on at least three other occasions.  On May 30, 1978, the Supreme Court held that the trial court could not enjoin 
GAC from proceeding with its right to arbitration against United.  General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 436 U.S. 493, 98 S.Ct. 1939, 56 
L.Ed.2d 480 (1978). GAC applied for a stay of all proceedings in the trial court on the basis that the threat of sanctions under 
Rule 37 violated the act of state doctrine.  This application was denied.  General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 435 U.S. 920, 98 S.Ct. 
1481, 55 L.Ed.2d 514 (1978). After sanctions were imposed, GAC sought immediate review by the Supreme Court of the 
sanctions order and default judgment. This petition was also denied.  General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 436 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 
2233, 56 L.Ed.2d 402 (1978)."
77,2," This action was originally filed on August 8, 1975 in Santa Fe District Court.  Both GAC and its constituent partners, Gulf and 
Scallop, were named as defendants in that case.  The case was removed to federal district court by gulf. On December 31, 
1975, United voluntarily dismissed the case in federal court, and refiled it on the same day in Santa Fe State District Court, 
naming only the partnership as a defendant.  It is this later case that is the subject of this appeal."
77,3," Detroit Edison Company, another electric utility company, was also impleaded by GAC, but was dismissed as a party in March 
1978 after it reached a settlement with GAC."
77,4," In 1979, most of the specific New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure with which we are concerned were amended (e.g., Rules 26, 
33, 34, 37).  Because this case was decided in the court below prior to the adoption of these amendments, all citations in this 
opinion are to the former rules. "
79,5," One issue in this case is whether United's so-called letters of intent with the utilities were actually non-binding letters of intent, 
or rather, binding contracts.  We will refer to them here as letters of intent, and discuss the legal nature of them in Section II B, 
infra, of this opinion.  However, collectively, the formal contracts and the letters of intent will be referred to as the utility contracts. "
82,6," Can.Stat.O. & R. 76-644 (1976).  The Regulations were promulgated pursuant to the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Act, 
1970, Can.Rev.Stat. c. A-19.  Pertinent portions of the original Regulations are set forth in n. 41, infra. "
83,7," ""If HN1[
] sanctions are imposed under Rule 37(b), . . . on appeal from the order imposing sanctions the appellate court will 
consider the propriety of the prior order for discovery."" C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil ยง 2289, at 
791 (1970) (footnote omitted).  See also Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 544 F.2d 182, 191 (5th Cir. 1976); Gordon v. Federal

Construction Company, 419 F.2d 955, 957 (7th Cir. 1969). "
84,8," As we discuss in Section III, infra, the failure to raise a timely objection to an interrogatory operates as a waiver of any objection 
a party might have.  However, we address GAC's objection to the production of partner documents notwithstanding its failure to 
raise a timely objection both because the trial court did not rely on the principle of waiver and because it is a question that has 
apparently never before been specifically decided by any court in the United States. Our decision to decide the question on its 
merits in no way detracts from the significance to the issues discussed in Section III, infra, of GAC's failure to comply with the 
express provisions of Rule 33."
84,9," The distinction between partnership and non-partnership documents confuses the relevancy of the information under Rule 
26(b) with its availability under Rules 33 and 34.  It is one thing to say that non-partnership-related documents are not relevant, 
but quite another to say that they are incapable of being obtained.  The trial court repeatedly made this crucial distinction.  If the 
partnership business was conducted as part of a coordinated Gulf effort to monopolize the uranium market, as United contends 
it was, then various Gulf documents pertaining to production and marketing of uranium might be relevant, even though they did 
not directly pertain to what was ostensibly the partnership business.  To permit the parties to determine what is related to the 
partnership business is to allow that party to make its own unilateral determination of the scope of discovery, which, of course, it 
may not do.  See United States v. Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc., 18 F.R.Serv.2d 318, 319 (N.D. Ill. 1973). "

86,15," Indeed, in its Reply Brief in this appeal, GAC conceded that Gulf's records were ""available"" to it.  GAC stated: GAC did not contend in the trial court that it would be unable to persuade Gulf to produce its domestic records if they came 
within a judicial order to produce.  Obviously, Gulf had -- and continues to have -- a very significant interest in this litigation.  
As one of GAC's constituent partners, it stands to gain or lose immediately from any decision. . . . . . . GAC did not represent to the trial court that Gulf would refuse to produce its documents if an order directing it to do so 
were entered.  (Emphasis added.) However, GAC had stated to the trial court that it had ""no obligation or ability to furnish . . . documents from Gulf Oil Corporation 
or Scallop Nuclear, Inc."" (Emphasis added.)"
86,16," The record is replete with evidence of the interconnection of the various aspects of Gulf's uranium business.  In addition to 
other examples discussed elsewhere in this opinion with respect to other issues raised on appeal, are the following examples, 
which should suffice to illustrate the point made here: When the cartel was formed, Gulf Canada informed Gulf's executives in 
Pittsburgh and Gulf Energy officials in San Diego.  Over the next six months, officials from Gulf Oil in Pittsburgh (O'Hara, 
Jackson, Ramsey), Gulf Minerals in Denver (Zagnoli, Allen) and Gulf Energy in San Diego (Hunter, Hoffman) were sent to 
Canada, Europe and Africa for cartel meetings.  Gregg of Gulf Energy was transferred to Gulf Canada, but remained in contact 
with officials of Gulf Energy (Hunter, Fowler) for at least several months.  Officials in Gulf Oil, Gulf Minerals and Gulf Energy 
participated in the decision to transfer Gregg.  In March 1972, Hoffman of Gulf Energy briefed the Gulf Minerals board on Gulf 
Energy's marketing activities.  In August 1972, Hunter briefed Gulf Oil executives in New York City.  Rolander of Gulf General 
Atomic, Gulf Energy, and later GAC, also sat on the boards of Gulf Canada and Gulf Minerals and was chairman of the board of 
Gulf-United.  Gulf Minerals had administrative responsibility for Gulf Canada, and Gulf Minerals' uranium marketing function was 
handled by Gulf General Atomic.  Gulf Energy's larger supply contracts were approved by Gulf's Pittsburgh executives.  Gulf 
Energy and Gulf Minerals worked together on plans for the development of Gulf's Mt. Taylor uranium reserves.  In March 1973, 
Hunter stated that Gulf Energy would ""work with GMCL [Gulf Canada] . . . to block"" a Westinghouse effort to secure uranium 
from Australia. "
87,17," The president of Gulf Energy, Mr. Rolander, became the president of GAC pursuant to the terms of the partnership 
agreement.  Mr. Gallaway, the executive vice-president of Gulf Energy, Mr. Johnston, Gulf General Atomic's vice-president for 
marketing, and Mr. Dieter, Gulf Energy's chief legal adviser, all continued to perform the same duties for GAC.  Mr. Hunter, who 
had attended the cartel's May 1972 meeting in Johannesburg as an executive of Gulf Energy, worked in a similar capacity for 
GAC, as did Mr. Fowler.  As executives of GAC, Gallaway and Dieter remained on the payroll of Gulf, not GAC. Most of these individuals played some role in the formation and operation of Gulf-United and in the acquisition of uranium by 
Gulf Energy and GAC.  (Rolander, Gallaway and Hunter negotiated the formation of Gulf-United and the execution of the 1971 
Supply Agreement with United.  All three were members of the Gulf-United board.) All of these individuals at one time or another 
were either involved in or aware of Gulf's participation in the cartel. Four months after the formation of GAC, Rolander rejoined the Gulf organization in Pittsburgh, where he remained until after this 
case was filed.  Mr. Gregg, the Gulf Energy employee who was transferred to Gulf Canada in Toronto and became a member of 
the cartel operating committee, returned to the United States in 1974 to work for GAC, where he remained until the month this 
case was filed."
87,18," One of the more extreme examples of the extent to which GAC has sought to differentiate into distinct compartments the 
interrelated activities of the various aspects of Gulf's uranium activities is the following: When Hunter and Hoffman flew from Gulf 
Energy's San Diego headquarters to the cartel meeting in Johannesburg in May 1972, they went, according to GAC, as 
representatives of Gulf Canada in Canada, and not Gulf Energy, despite the fact that immediately prior to and after their week-
long trip they were top officials with Gulf Energy, and despite the fact that they apparently continued to receive cartel information 
in their San Diego offices for several more months in order to coordinate Gulf's foreign and domestic uranium marketing efforts.  
The absurdity of GAC's position is highlighted by Hoffman's deposition in the Westinghouse litigation, where he testified that he 
went to Johannesburg ""as an advisor to-I don't recall the name of the Canadian company.  What was it?  GMCL?  Was that their 
initials?"" "
88,19," The fact that Gulf and Scallop were named as parties in the original suit, which United voluntarily dismissed after its removal to 
federal court (see n. 2, supra), is completely immaterial to the question of the proper scope of Rules 33 and 34.  The scope of 
discovery under those rules does not expand or contract depending on whether or not the individual partners once were or now 
could be named as parties."
88,20," Although Rule 26(b) refers only to depositions, the scope of discovery permitted under Rules 33 (interrogatories) and 34 
(production of documents) is defined in terms of the relevancy standard established in Rule 26(b).  See Davis v. Westland

91,29," In his deposition in this case, Gregg first testified that United and Gulf-United were never discussed at any cartel meetings.  
He later qualified that answer by stating that he could not recall those companies being discussed at meetings at which he was 
present.  When specifically questioned regarding the foregoing passage from his Westinghouse deposition, Gregg conceded 
that he had made the statement, but he said he could not recall ""who or who was not discussed other than Westinghouse."" He 
stated that Gulf-United and General Electric were ""representative of who might have been discussed""; but he could not 
remember whether or not Gulf-United was ever discussed. Hunter testified in his deposition in this case that Gulf-United was discussed by Gulf officials at the cartel meeting he attended in 
Johannesburg in 1972.  He stated: I raised the point that from my standpoint and understanding in what we were trying to do in the uranium supply, the 
[cartel's] middleman restriction would affect our ability to buy uranium to serve Gulf-United and HTGR [high temperature 
gas cooled reactors]. He went on to say that by virtue of the cartel's rules, Gulf-United ""would have to pay the same higher price that . . . 
Westinghouse would have to pay."" But he said that this matter ""wasn't of concern"" to the other Gulf participants. "
92,30," GAC asserts that United's commercial impracticability claim is a ""patent make-weight"" because United's forty page trial brief 
on the subject contained only six sentences concerning the cartel. Relevancy for purposes of discovery is not measured by such "
93,," a sentence-to-page ratio.  As to I&M's defense to GAC's claim of commercial impracticability, GAC's counsel told the trial court 
at a hearing on August 26, 1977: We can understand the people like Indiana-Michigan or Detroit-Edison feeling some sort of misery caused by the present 
prices of uranium, and we suspect that they will be completely unable to establish anything to do with the cartel leading to 
the existence of the price levels.  . . . Obviously, the cartel is not made irrelevant to I&M's claims simply because GAC's counsel ""suspects"" that those claims would 
ultimately not be proved.  Cf.  American Mfrs. M. I. Co. v. American Broadcasting -- Para. Th., 388 F.2d 272, 279 n.9 (2d Cir. 
1967) HN11[
] (""'[T]hat it might be surmised that the adverse party is unlikely to prevail at the trial is not sufficient to authorize 
summary judgment against him'"") (citation omitted)."
93,31," The Detroit Edison letter of intent, which is dated September 25, 1969, reads in part: Please be advised that The Detroit Edison Company has determined and intends to enter into a contract with the United 
Nuclear Corporation for the nuclear materials, fabrication, and services therein defined. United Nuclear Corporation and Detroit Edison will proceed reasonably toward the negotiation, drafting, and execution of a 
formal written contract which will reflect the pertinent rights and obligations of each party as generally set forth in the "
94,," referenced documents and as discussed and to be discussed during the various meetings of representatives of our two 
companies.  It is also subject to the receipt of all necessary approvals of regulatory authorities.  (Emphasis added.) Formal definitive contracts were signed on the basis of this letter of intent and a letter of intent of December 30, 1970 with Duke 
Power, on March 19, 1973 by Gulf-United, and on November 7, 1973 by Gulf, respectively.  United signed two additional letters 
of intent with Yankee Atomic and Consolidated Edison.  The latter two letters were also assigned to Gulf-United in 1971, but 
formal contracts were never signed, and the uranium covered by these letters is not included in the 1973 Supply Agreement."
94,32," Notes of a GAC-Gulf litigation strategy meeting held on January 13, 1976 in San Diego, which were inadvertently produced to 
United in this case, reflect a GAC ""plan to welch on all utility contracts."" (Emphasis in original.)"
94,33," GAC's arguments are contained in a forty-six page appendix entitled ""Review of Historical Facts."" This appendix was filed 
along with GAC's reply brief.  It apparently was not included in that brief because GAC had already met the 150 page limit on 
that brief which this Court had specifically set at GAC's request.  We note that GAC did not seek leave of the Court to exceed 
that page limitation in order to include these additional arguments in its reply brief, nor did it seek or receive permission from the 
Court to file such an argument in an appendix, rather than in a brief.  ""[W]e disapprove of and will in the future disregard "
95,," attempts by counsel to supplement their briefs in a manner not authorized by the rules."" Lance v. New Mexico Military Institute,

95,34," ""HN15[
] Ordinarily, in ruling on a discovery motion, the Court will not determine whether a claim in the complaint, if proved, 
would have a bearing on the ultimate outcome of the action, it being sufficient that the matter to be explored is relevant to the 
issues made by the pleading."" Apel v. Murphy, 70 F.R.D. 651, 654 (D.R.I.1976) (citation omitted).  See also Humphreys

F.Supp. 932, 945 n. 9 (E.D.Ark.1953). "
96,35," In the findings it entered as sanctions against GAC for GAC's failure to comply with its discovery orders, the trial court found 
that the cartel was made up of uranium producers. Although the court did not mention government participation in the cartel, it 
did find that the Canadian Government had ""encouraged,"" but neither ""required,"" ""mandated,"" nor ""compelled"" Gulf or Gulf 
Canada to participate in the cartel."
96,36," According to that Government, the cartel was created in order to protect the uranium mining industries of the participating 
nations from the adverse consequences of an embargo the United States Government had established in 1964 on the 
importation of foreign uranium into this country.  See Act of August 26, 1964, P.L. 88-489, 78 Stat. 602."
96,37," Although this case dealt with the doctrine as it applies to an act of one of the states of the United States, the Court's ruling in 
Cantor applies to acts of foreign governments as well.  See Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F.2d 68, 80 (2d Cir. 1977) (Van

] The real question is whose acts are the subject of inquiry.  If the acts are those of the foreign government within 
its own jurisdiction, then the antitrust exception applies.  The situation is the same if the foreign government through its 
laws, regulations, or orders, requires private parties to perform the anticompetitive acts.  If, on the other hand, the acts 
complained of are in reality those of private parties who seek to hide behind the cloak of foreign law, the courts will attach 
antitrust liability."

American Business Abroad 65-75 (1958); W. Fugate, supra, at 29-34."
97,40," GAC itself made this very distinction to the court below.  In its opening statement at the trial, GAC's counsel stated: [T]he 1973 and 1974 supply agreements were not the part, product, or in any way connected with an agreement of the 
cartel. Now, it may be that Gulf was motivated to go into the agreements because of the cartel, or its knowledge of the cartel.  
There may be a lot of things.  And all of those ""maybes"" may come out at trial.  (Emphasis added.) "
98,41," The Regulations read in pertinent part: No person who has in his possession or under his control any note, document or other written or printed material in any 
way related to conversations, discussions or meetings that took place between January 1, 1972 and December 31, 1975 
involving that person or any other person or any government, crown corporation, agency or other organization in respect of 
the production, import, export, transportation, refining, possession, ownership, use or sale of uranium or its derivatives or 
compounds shall (a) release any such note, document or material, or disclose or communicate the contents thereof to any 
person, government, crown corporation, agency or other organization unless (i) he is required to do so by or under a law of 
Canada, or (ii) he does so with the consent of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources; or (b) fail to guard against or 
take reasonable care to prevent the unauthorized release of any such note, document or material or the disclosure or 
communication of the contents thereof. The Regulations were amended in October 1977, but the amendments are not pertinent to the issues in this case."
98,42," On appeal, GAC has contended that a court cannot, without violating the act of state doctrine, ""inquire into what was the real 
scope of the Canadian policy,"" nor ""judge what was the entire contour of the Canadian policy and was anything done outside the 
contours of that policy."" That that proposition is untenable should be evident.  See Baker, supra, 11 Cornell Int'l L. J. at 177 n. 67. If GAC's position was 
adopted, then an act of state or sovereign compulsion defense could be irrefutably established by the mere assertion of it by the 
party seeking its protection."

99,44," In his opinion in In Re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1154, Judge Marshall indicated that cartel records 
could have a vital bearing on the defendants' defenses of sovereign compulsion.  Thus, he indicated that merely by raising the 
sovereign compulsion defense, a defendant could not preclude a court from seeking documents located in a foreign country 
which might be relevant to the merits of that defense.  Compare GAC's position at n. 42, supra."
99,45," On August 17, 1972, the Canadian Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources wrote to the President of the Canadian Atomic 
Energy Control Board, informing him that the Canadian Government had approved a regulation governing the export of uranium 
from Canada ""[i]n order to enforce compliance with the terms of the marketing arrangements."" The letter began by stating that 
""[o]n June 29, 1972, [the Canadian] Cabinet approved the terms of a uranium export marketing arrangement [the cartel] "
100,," proposed by producers in Canada and several other countries."" (Emphasis added.) One writer suggested that ""this document 
reveals an approval by government of a privately proposed arrangement, which was in turn implemented by government orders."" 
Baker, supra, 11 Cornell Int'l L.J. at 183 n. 94. Compare W. Fugate, supra, at 148 (""[I]f private parties . . . influence foreign

101,48," Six members of the Supreme Court in First Nat. City Bk. rejected the notion that the position of the executive branch is 
dispositive of the question of the applicability of the act of state doctrine in a particular case. "
102,49," GAC has brought to our attention two letters written by the Justice Department to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and to 
Judge Marshall in the Westinghouse uranium litigation now pending before those courts.  See In Re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 
617 F.2d 1248 (7th Cir. 1980) and D.C., 480 F.Supp. 1138, supra.  On March 18, 1980, the Justice Department sent the 
Seventh Circuit a letter from the State Department which referred to criticism of foreign governments in a recent decision of that 
court (see 617 F.2d at 1256). The State Department said that this criticism had ""caused serious embarrassment to the United 
States in its relations with some of our closest allies."" It stated that ""the foreign governments concerned have substantial interest 
not only in [the Westinghouse] litigation, but also in certain broader issues which it raises."" It said that although ""the United 
States Government does not share some of the views presented by the foreign governments,"" it recognized ""the genuineness of 
their concerns,"" and believed that their views should be considered by the courts because they ""may assist the judiciary . . . in 
making the necessary accommodations between the laws and policies of various sovereign nations."" In May of this year, Associate Attorney General John Shennefield asked Judge Marshall to give ""appropriate deference and 
weight"" to the views and representations of the foreign governments.  He stated that because the Westinghouse case 
""implicates foreign policy concerns of both the United States and foreign governments,"" ""it would be inappropriate, in the 
absence of bad faith, to inflict punishment against a defendant . . . for inability to comply with the discovery order of the court 
because of a contrary foreign criminal law."" (Emphasis added.) He urged the court to consider ""the consequences of the 
absence of complete discovery"" by reference to the factors identified in Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 78 S.Ct. 
1087, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958). Unlike the Seventh Circuit's recent decision, nothing either this Court or the trial court below has said in this case was critical of 
the Government of Canada.  In May of this year, the Government of Canada sought leave of this Court to file an amicus curiae 
brief in this appeal.  The motion was filed over two years after entry of the sanctions order and default judgment, and one year 
after the case had been argued to this Court.  No reason was given for the delay in filing the motion, and accordingly, it was 
denied.  In any case, the views of the Canadian Government were presented to the trial court, and are part of the record on 
appeal.  We have fully considered them in reaching our decision.  Like the State Department, however, we do not share some of 
the Canadian Government's views, though we have given full credence to their representations.  The State Department's 
statement that the views of the foreign governments involved ""may assist the judiciary . . . in making the necessary 
accommodations between the laws and policies of the various sovereign nations,"" is inconsistent with the notion that judicial 
examination of the matters at issue is precluded by the act of state doctrine.  It is worth noting that neither the State nor the 
Justice Department has communicated similar concerns either to the court below or to this Court over the course of this 
litigation.  Finally, the default judgment imposed in this case was based on findings that GAC acted in bad faith.  Those findings 
are supported by the record; and they are consistent with the requirements of Societe Internationale (see Section III A, infra), 
and the concerns the Justice Department expressed in its most recent letter concerning the Westinghouse litigation. "
103,50," The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has an established policy regarding the application of American antitrust laws 
to the international activities of American corporations which is consistent with the actions taken by the Division regarding this 
cartel and with the discovery orders entered in this case.  In the Antitrust Guide for International Operations, (see n. 47, supra), 
the Justice Department discusses its position concerning the application of the act of state doctrine to two hypothetical situations 
(cases ""K"" and ""L"") that have a direct bearing on the allegations against GAC and Gulf in this case."
103,51," United States v. Borden Co., 347 U.S. 514, 518, 74 S.Ct. 703, 706, 98 L.Ed. 903 (1954); Battle v. Liberty National Life 
Insurance Company, 493 F.2d 39, 52 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1110, 95 S.Ct. 784, 42 L.Ed.2d 807 (1975); In Re 
Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1154. Sections 57-1-1 and 57-1-2, N.M.S.A.1978, make certain anti-competitive trade practices a crime in New Mexico.  Section 57-1-
3, N.M.S.A.1978, provides a private party with a cause of action for damages it suffers by reason of the same practices."
103,52," ""Private litigation under the antitrust laws plays an important role in the enforcement of antitrust violations.  It supplements 
public enforcement, 'increases the likelihood that a violator will be found out, greatly enlarges his penalties, and thereby helps "
104,," discourage illegal conduct.'"" Wechsler, New Mexico Restraint of Trade Statutes-A Legislative Proposal, 9 N.M.L.Rev. 1, 20 
(1979) (footnote omitted)."
104,53," Although similar to the act of state doctrine, this second principle is distinct in that the former looks to the power of American 
courts in general, whereas the latter is concerned with the power of an American state court.  HN21[
] The act of state doctrine 
rests on the principle of separation of powers between branches of the federal government; the principle of exclusive federal 
power over the conduct of foreign relations is based on the concept of federalism."
104,54," ""Antitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.  They are as important to 
the preservation of economic freedom and our free-enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the protection of our fundamental 
personal freedoms."" United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 1135, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972). ""So crucial are antitrust laws to the economy of the state that the New Mexico Constitution [Art. IV, ยง 38] mandates the 
enactment of laws 'to prevent trusts, monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade.'"" Wechsler, 9 N.M.L.Rev. at 22."
104,55," These statutes had largely been applied to communist countries.  In the years following their passage, the statutes were 
subject to widespread criticism by legal scholars for being unsound legislation which had been both ineffective and prejudicially 
applied.  See e.g., the authorities cited in 32 Alb.L.Rev. 646, 649 n.15 (1968). In applying these statutes, state courts had on 
occasion criticized foreign governments in strong and intemperate language.  See examples cited in Zschernig, supra, 389 U.S. 
at 437-39 n.8, 88 S.Ct. at 669 n.8 and in 82 Harv.L.Rev. at 239, n.8. Commentators were virtually unanimous in condemning 
these statutes and in applauding the Zschernig decision.  One said: ""[C]learly the state has no interest in inquiries of the sort 
which [Zschernig] condemned."" 82 Harv.L.Rev. at 245. See also 32 Alb.L.Rev. at 653-54. "
105,56," It is worth noting that the Congressional subcommittee investigating the cartel held several of its hearings in unprecedented 
joint sessions with a committee of the New York State Assembly in order to assist that state's independent investigation of the 
cartel. Hearings on International Uranium Cartel, supra, Vol. I, Serial Nos. 95-39, p. 130 and No. 95-95, p. 1."
105,57," In ordering production of Gulf's Canadian cartel documents in the Westinghouse litigation, Judge Marshall rejected the very 
same act of state argument GAC advances here.  He stated: "
106,," Plaintiffs have not challenged the validity of any of the foreign nondisclosure laws which are relied on by defendants.  The 
issue is not whether those laws are valid, but rather, conceding their validity, whether they excuse defendants from 
complying with a production order. In Re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1149."
106,58," In his recent decision ordering Gulf and other parties in the Westinghouse litigation to produce cartel records located in 
Canada and elsewhere, United States District Judge Marshall stated that ""the policies supporting an inquiry into corporate 
activities and structure are at least as weighty, and probably stronger, with the antitrust statutes here than they were with the 
Trading with the Enemy Act in Societe Internationale."" In Re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1154 (citation 
omitted). "
107,," In a decision rendered on March 18 of this year, the Supreme Court of Canada denied an application of Gulf Oil for letters 
rogatory to secure cartel documents located in Canada.  Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gulf Canada Ltd. (Slip Op. March 18, 1980).  Gulf 
sought the letters in order to comply with discovery orders entered by Judge Marshall in the Westinghouse litigation.  See In Re 
Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. 1138. The Canadian high court stated that the Canadian Government's 
""resistance to disclosure was not so much a matter of the maintenance of secrecy as it was of an assertion of Canadian 
sovereignty to resist the extra-territorial application of United States anti-trust laws."" The court stated that it failed to see how 
such a policy ""can be ignored in the interests of comity towards a foreign court, as if the policy was essentially a reflection of 
private considerations without any public, governmental interest."" But it stated: ""It may be that different considerations will 
operate where a Canadian court is concerned with Canadian litigation arising out of issues turning on Canadian law."" The antitrust issues in this litigation reflect more than ""private considerations without any public, governmental interest."" See 
n.54, supra.  We cannot subscribe to the idea that the fundamental public policy which the antitrust laws embody must be 
ignored in the interests of comity towards the policy of a foreign state, particularly where the highest court of that state intimates 
that it would not necessarily be bound by the same policy of its own government in litigation ""turning on Canadian law."""
107,59," In 1979, the New Mexico Legislature substantially revised the Antitrust Act.  See N.M. Laws 1979, ch. 374, ยงยง 1-18 (codified 
as Sections 57-1-1 to 57-1-15, N.M.S.A.1978 (Supp.1979)).  In this case, we are concerned with the prior act, Sections 57-1-1 to 
57-1-3, N.M.S.A.1978."
107,60," GAC's argument as to the inapplicability of the New Mexico Antitrust Act relates only to the antitrust issues in this case.  
However, as we have already held, the information and documents sought were also relevant to United's claims of fraud, breach 
of fiduciary duty, economic coercion and commercial impracticability.  The judgment for I&M was based on commercial 
impracticability under Section 55-2-615, N.M.S.A.1978.  GAC makes no claim that trial of these issues was precluded by the 
Commerce Clause or the Sherman Antitrust Act."
107,61," HN22[
] U.S.Const., Art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3 provides: ""The Congress shall have Power . . . to regulate Commerce with the foreign Nations, and among the several States, and 
with the Indian Tribes.  . . ."" "
109,62," GAC relies on the case of Kosuga v. Kelly, 257 F.2d 48 (7th Cir. 1958), aff'd on other grounds, 358 U.S. 516, 79 S.Ct. 429, 3 
L.Ed.2d 475 (1959), in which the court held that the Illinois Antitrust Act did not apply to a contract for the sale of onions in 
interstate commerce.  That decision indicated that the scope of the Illinois Act extended solely to intrastate commerce.  See 
Henry G. Meigs, Inc. v. Empire Petroleum Company, 273 F.2d 424, 430 (7th Cir. 1960); R. E. Spriggs Co. v. Adolph Coors 
Company, supra, 112 Cal.Rptr. at 591. To the extent that Kosuga held state antitrust laws to be generally inapplicable to 
transactions involving interstate commerce, we decline to follow it.  The language in Kosuga which supports such a holding has 
been criticized for its lack of authority and reasoning.  See R. E. Spriggs Co. v. Adolph Coors Company, supra, 112 Cal.Rptr. at 
591; J. Flynn, supra, at 74-75; Pollack, Federal Preemption and State Antitrust Enforcement, 43 Chi. Bar Record 145 (1961).  
Kosuga relied on a reference to Corpus Juris Secundum, but the cases cited by C.J.S. do not stand for the proposition stated in 
the text.  Two years after Kosuga, the Seventh Circuit applied a Wisconsin antitrust law to a transaction involving interstate 
commerce.  Henry G. Meigs, Inc. v. Empire Petroleum Company, supra."
109,63," GAC does suggest New Mexico will be benefited by invalidation of the contracts because United will be permitted to sell the 
uranium at higher prices, thus increasing local tax revenues and forcing out-of-state consumers to pay higher utility rates.  
However, any such consequences are entirely indirect results of the application of laws which, on their face, have no 
discriminatory aspects.  GAC, of course, seeks to avoid its obligations to I&M, which, if successful, would have precisely the "
110,," same effect on I&M's customers.  Furthermore, if United were to sell any of this uranium for use inside New Mexico, New Mexico 
consumers would pay the same higher price.  It is also interesting to note that GAC's argument that higher uranium prices will 
result in higher tax revenues in this State is based on GAC's recognition that the uranium would have been supplied from New 
Mexico sources. "
111,64," See n. 50, supra, and accompanying text.  In addition to the hearings held on the anti-competitive practices of the cartel (see 
Hearings on International Uranium Cartel, supra), in 1975 another subcommittee of the U. S. House of Representatives held 
extensive hearings on competition in the energy industry.  Energy Industry Investigation: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on 
Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., Serial No. 48-49, Parts 1-2

role in the uranium cartel.)"

114,73," Because the New Mexico Antitrust Act ""does not provide for treble damages as available to federal litigants, the ability to have 
a contract declared void is the most effective tool provided by New Mexico law."" Weschler, supra, 9 N.M.L.Rev. at 9 n. 70."
114,74," In Electric City Supply Company, the contract sued upon was not even alleged to have violated the antitrust laws. There, a 
contractor sold equipment to a municipality which he had purchased from a materialman.  After the contractor was paid by the 
city, he sought to avoid his obligation to pay the materialman on the ground that his contract with the municipality violated state 
and federal antitrust laws. The materialman was not a party to that contract.  Thus, since the contractor had been fully paid by 
the city, this Court refused to permit him to avoid his obligation to pay the materialman."
114,75," A similar argument was rejected in the unreported decision of General Atomic Company v. Exxon Nuclear Company, Inc., (No. 
78-223E) (S.D.Cal., Sept. 6, 1978).  Like United here, Exxon sought to have its obligation to supply uranium to GAC declared 
invalid.  The court held that a contract need not call for some overtly illegal act on its face before performance of it is enjoined.  
The court concluded that it would be enough if it was proved that GAC's contract with Exxon ""would have the effect of securing 
to GAC monopoly control of the relevant uranium market."" "
115,76," Because both Rio Grande Gas Company v. Gilbert, supra, and Pizza Hut of Santa Fe, Inc. v. Branch, supra, involved such 
sanctions, the requirement of a willful refusal they applied is consistent with the approach we take here.  Kalosha v. Novick, 77 
N.M. 627, 426 P.2d 598 (1967), is also consistent with the distinction we make based on Societe Internationale v. Rogers, supra, 
because Kalosha involved Rule 37(d), which, unlike Rule 37(b)(2), expressly requires a showing of willfulness. "

118,79," See n. 2, supra.  Answers to the interrogatories never became due in the earlier action, and none were ever filed."
118,80," The interrogatories contain the following definitions: B. ""Gulf"" means Gulf Oil Corporation and person(s), as hereafter defined. . . . D. ""General Atomic"" means General Atomic Company, a partnership, its general partners Gulf and Scallop, and all 
person(s) as hereafter defined. . . . F. ""Person(s)"" means all entities, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all individuals, any and all 
business entities, associations, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures or corporations which are owned or 
controlled by or which are under common control of any corporation and any person acting on behalf of any of the entities 
described in this definition.  (Emphasis added.) The interrogatories which are of particular importance to the issues on this appeal are the following:"
118,30," . Identify all properties owned or controlled by the partnership or the partners directly or indirectly for the exploration, 
development or mining of uranium bearing ore."
118,31," . Identify all licenses, permits, leases and agreements and all past and pending, contemplated negotiations of the 
partnership or the partners directly or indirectly pertaining to the exploration, development, mining and milling of uranium 
bearing ores."
118,32," . Identify all agreements and all past, pending or contemplated negotiations of the partnership or the partners directly or 
indirectly pertaining to the processing of uranium bearing ores into U[3]O[8] the conversion thereof into UF[6] or any other 
form and the marketing and sale of all such uranium bearing products."
118,33," . Identify all agreements and all past, pending and contemplated negotiations of the partnership or the partners directly or 
indirectly pertaining to the acquisition of uranium in any form."
118,34," . Identify all studies, evaluations, projections and other data pertaining to uranium ore reserves, the mining and milling 
thereof, the further processing and conversion of uranium and the marketing and sale of all such uranium products. "
119,, . . .
119,69," . Specify a date and place where counsel for Plaintiff may examine and reproduce the relevant business records of the 
partnership or the partners and each of them and those records of GUNFC [Gulf-United] in the custody of the partnership or 
the partners.  (Emphasis added.)"
119,81," The notes also reflect that the idea of filing a motion to disqualify United's counsel was discussed and rejected.  However, the 
motion was filed fourteen months later.  See Section IV, infra, especially n. 152, infra.  See also n. 32, supra."
119,82," Rule 30(b) provides for protective orders from the taking of depositions. Rule 33 provides that the provisions of Rule 30(b) 
apply to interrogatories as well."
119,83," GAC originally contended that on February 13, 1976, United had agreed that answers to the interrogatories did not have to be 
filed on February 23.  At a hearing on October 1, 1976, GAC conceded that although a proposal to that effect was discussed, no 
such agreement was ever reached. "
120,84," On January 19, 1976, GAC filed an interpleader action against United, and on the following day, Gulf filed the declaratory 
judgment action.  Both actions were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and appeals were taken from the 
dismissals.  Dismissal of the first action was affirmed.  General Atomic Co. v. Duke Power Co., 553 F.2d 53 (10th Cir. 1977). The 
appeal in the second case was abandoned.  Gulf Oil Corp. v. United Nuclear Corp., Civ. No. 76-032-B (D.N.M.1976).  In neither 
case did GAC nor Gulf seek arbitration or the disqualification of United's counsel.  See n. 152, infra."
120,85," Indeed, GAC answered Interrogatory 69, which asked for a date and place where United could examine ""the relevant business 
records of the partnership or the partners and each of them and those records of GUNFC [Gulf-United] in the custody of the 
partnership or the partners"" (emphasis added), as follows: Answer No. 69.  June 20, 1976, General Atomic Company, San Diego, California. "
121,86," There is no evidence that Gulf or GAC played any role in securing the adoption of the Regulations. To the contrary, the 
Canadian Government has stated: ""These Regulations were not procured by members of the uranium industry.  . . ."" However, 
that Government has said that the Regulations were promulgated ""when it became clear that documents located in Canada 
bearing on the [cartel] might be removed to the United States in response to proceedings there."" The Canadian Government's 
immediate concern was apparently several cases involving Westinghouse.  See n. 88, infra."

Busch, 47 F.R.D. 371, 372-73 (E.D.Pa.1969) (answers compelled ""notwithstanding that much of the information sought is totally 
irrelevant . . . and notwithstanding that the interrogatories . . . are harassing and vexatious,"" and ""patently objectionable"")."

125,92," In In Re Folding Carton Antitrust Litigation, supra, 76 F.R.D. at 423-24, the defendant corporation objected to the definition of 
an interrogatory served on it to the extent that it required the production of documents in the custody of its parent corporation.  
An affidavit was later filed by an officer of the defendant subsidiary, in which he swore that he had searched the files of the 
parent company to determine the existence of any documents called for by the plaintiffs' discovery requests.  He also stated that 
only certain documents in the parent's files were within the ambit of that request.  Based on these statements, the court refused 
to entertain the defendant's objection that it had no ""control"" over the parent's records.  The situation is almost identical here, 
except that GAC, unlike the defendant in that case, did not present its objection to the court in a timely fashion."
125,93," Cf.  Bollard v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., supra, 56 F.R.D. at 575 (defendant's HN41[
] ""later unilateral . . . supplying of 
partial answers constituted an admission that the original disavowals and claims of unavailability of knowledge were false 
answers made with knowledge of their falsity."" (Citation omitted.))."
125,94," For example, in answer to Interrogatory 30, which called for the identification of the uranium ore bearing properties of ""the 
partnership or the partners,"" GAC stated: ""Neither of the partners owns or controls any such property for or on behalf of the 
partnership."" United's counsel, of course, knew that Gulf owned massive uranium reserves at Mt. Taylor.  See Section IV, infra."
125,95," In certain circumstances, a failure to object to insufficient interrogatory answers can constitute a waiver of any right to further 
answers or sanctions.  In Butler v. Pettigrew, 409 F.2d 1205, 1207 (7th Cir. 1969), the court found such a waiver where the party "
126,," complaining of insufficient answers failed to seek sanctions until after a trial on the merits and the entry of a judgment thereon.  
Such extreme circumstances are not present here."
126,96," GAC's counsel stated to the court in March 1977 that in United's complaint, ""Gulf is the main focal point of the action."" See 
also n. 153, infra.  It could hardly have come as a surprise to GAC then that United sought information from Gulf."
126,97," In its briefs on appeal, GAC describes the cartel as a marketing agreement, precisely the language used in Interrogatory 32."
126,98," GAC points out that although the court had ordered it to produce Gulf information and documents, it had not ordered it to 
produce cartel documents.  What ""cartel documents"" are in the context of this case, if they are not Gulf documents, has never 
been apparent to this Court.  In any case, in March 1977, the court did order GAC to produce the Grand Jury and Duquesne 
documents, which, as GAC was later to concede, ""all had to do with the cartel."" "
127,99," The executive vice-president of GAC, Gallaway, whose involvement in cartel discussions was discussed in Sections II A and 
B, supra, of this opinion, verified GAC's first answers to the First Set of Interrogatories, which failed to mention the cartel."
127,100," The fact that the Duquesne and Grand Jury documents were produced is no excuse for the total failure to mention the cartel 
in those answers.  In January 1977, the court had held that ""in addition to providing the documentation, you will have to answer 
the interrogatories. . . . [United is] entitled to their answers to interrogatories in addition to the right to inspect and copy 
documents, so that you will pin yourself down and bind yourself by your answers; instead of merely furnishing the document to 
them."" That information on Gulf's participation in the cartel's marketing agreements could have been provided, apart from 
information in the cartel documents in Canada, is evidenced by the fact that GAC later filed three sets of answers to United's 
Second Set of Interrogatories on the cartel, and by the presence in the United States of several GAC and Gulf employees who 
were intimately familiar with the cartel. "
128,101," Seven months later, GAC's counsel informed the trial court: ""Mr. Rolander, Mr. Gallaway, Mr. Allen, Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Zagnoli, 
all of them knew about the cartel."" In fact, records GAC produced show that Allen and Hoffman were among Gulf's 
representatives at the Johannesburg meeting of the cartel in May and June 1972."
128,102," On October 24, 1977, GAC's counsel stated: ""Let's go to the cartel. It's undisputed.  . . . It was in its intention a cartel in 
every sense of the word."""
128,103," By the end of March, United had submitted two proposed pretrial orders which listed GAC's and Gulf's participation in the 
cartel as a contested issue of law, and a proposed amendment to its complaint which charged that Gulf and GAC were members 
of a cartel which violated the New Mexico Antitrust Act, and that the 1973 Supply Agreement was obtained in furtherance of the 
cartel's activities. I&M filed a counterclaim on March 7 containing allegations concerning the cartel. GAC's reply, filed on March 28, denied these 
allegations, thus placing the cartel squarely at issue."
128,104," The document United referred to in support of this allegation was introduced into evidence at a hearing on November 1, 1976, 
over GAC's objection that the exhibit ""has nothing to do with GAC, and has nothing to do with the issues in this case."" However, 
the exhibit contained two documents, both of which were written by and addressed to officials at Gulf Energy (Hunter, Rolander, 
Gregg and Hoffman), all of whom later occupied key positions in GAC.  See Section II A, supra, especially n. 16-17, supra.  The 
documents referred to early cartel meetings in Canada.  GAC unsuccessfully sought a protective order in order to keep these 
records sealed from the public."
128,105," This concession also contradicts the representation GAC later made to the trial court.  In an affidavit filed in March 1978 in 
support of its motion for reconsideration of the default judgment, a GAC attorney stated that he ""did not consider or recognize"" 
that the cartel was an issue in this case until August 1977.  However, it was this very same attorney who objected on March 25, 
1977 to what he called ""the continual reference to the so-called international uranium cartel."" "
129,106," GAC first raised the Ontario Business Records Protection Act as a bar to discovery on March 1, 1977.  It again relied on it in 
October 1977, and thereafter."
129,107," Other courts have held the Ontario Business Records Protection Act to be inapplicable in similar situations.  See In Re 
Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1143; American Industrial Contr., Inc. v. Johns-Manville Corp., 326 F.Supp.

Discovery Orders in Antitrust Litigation, 88 Yale L. J. 612, 624 (1979)."" "
131,113," Six months later, GAC took the position that the cartel was first raised as an issue when the Second Set of Interrogatories 
was filed in August.  It has abandoned this position on appeal, as it must.  See n.n. 103 and 105, supra, and accompanying text. "
134,114," GAC also objected on the grounds that the interrogatories inquired into irrelevant matters.  This contention is addressed in 
Section II B, supra, of this opinion."
134,115," For the same reason, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to grant GAC's motion for a continuance of the trial setting or 
to require additional discovery from GAC during the course of the trial.  In Wieneke v. Chalmers, supra, 73 N.M. at 12, 385 P.2d 
at 68, this Court held that HN45[
] it was within the sound discretion of the trial court to permit additional discovery during the 
course of a trial, particularly where the need for it results from previous failures to make discovery. In refusing to grant a 
continuance in this case, the trial court noted that the remaining discovery ""in good faith should have been taken care of earlier."" 
In these circumstances, ""[t]o grant another continuance would in effect be a sanction against the Court."" G-K Prop. v. 
Redevelop. Agcy. of City of San Jose, 409 F.Supp. 955, 959 (N.D.Cal.1976), aff'd, 577 F.2d 645 (9th Cir. 1978)."
134,116," At a hearing on January 11, 1977, the court stated: ""[W]henever an interrogatory is propounded to General Atomic, it is 
propounded to GAC's constituent partners also.  That is my ruling.  The interrogatories . . . [are] obligatory upon the constituent 
partners."" On January 21, the court entered an order to this effect. "
135,117," See Martin v. Easton Publishing Co., supra, 85 F.R.D. at 315; Flour Mills of America, Inc. v. Pace, 75 F.R.D. 676, 682 
(E.D.Okla.1977); Kozlowski v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 73 F.R.D. 73, 76-77 (D.Mass.1976); Harlem River Con. C., Inc. v. 
Associated G. of Harlem, Inc., supra, 64 F.R.D. at 462; Budget Rent-A-Car of Missouri, Inc. v. Hertz Corporation, 55 F.R.D. 354, 
357 (W.D.Mo.1972); Life Music, Inc. v. Broadcast Music, Inc., supra, 41 F.R.D. at 25; Smith v. Danvir Corporation, 55 Del. 418, 
188 A.2d 118, 120-21 (1963)."
135,118," For example, one such reference was to thirty-two pages of the deposition of Zagnoli, the head of Gulf Minerals, which had 
been taken in the Westinghouse litigation.  In twenty-two of those pages, Zagnoli answered questions with the phrases ""I do not 
recall"" twenty-one times and ""I don't know"" twelve times.  When Zagnoli was asked if ""I don't recall"" meant the same thing as ""I 
don't know,"" he responded: ""I don't know that."" "
137,119," GAC's mention in March of the proscriptions of those laws is no excuse for its failure to raise the point in August and 
September.  As far as the trial court knew, the laws might have been repealed, or a waiver of them secured.  In any case, in 
March GAC had not specified those proscriptions with the particularity the law requires."
137,120," GAC did inform the trial court on September 9, 1977, that some employees who were active in the cartel no longer were 
employed by GAC or Gulf. But it did not represent that it would be unable to furnish responsive answers because of their 
absence, either at that time or in its original answers of September 26, 1977. "
139,121," For similar reasons, GAC's reliance on In Re Westinghouse Elec. Corp. Uranium, Etc., supra, 563 F.2d 992, is misplaced.  
There the court reversed a contempt citation against Rio Algom for its failure to comply with subpoenas, where compliance 
would have violated the same Canadian regulations at issue here.  However, the Court of Appeals found that Rio Algom had 
acted in good faith; had made a diligent effort to produce records which were not subject to the Canadian regulations; and had 
made an adequate effort to secure a waiver of the regulations from Canadian authorities.  In this case, the trial court made 
findings to the contrary, which, with the exceptions noted herein, we have found to be supported by the record.  We also take 
note of the following factors in the Tenth Circuit's opinion which find no parallel here -- (1) the discovery at issue was ""in a sense 
cumulative"" (563 F.2d at 999); (2) the case did not involve the enforcement of antitrust laws (id.); and (3) Rio Algom was not a 
party in the litigation, had not sought affirmative relief from the court, and therefore, was not in a position to profit from its failure 
to comply with the production orders.  Compare Societe, 357 U.S. at 212, 78 S.Ct. at 1095. See also n. 125, infra. "
140,122," On February 22, 1978, GAC suggested that the court and counsel for appellees meet with Canadian officials.  Both the court 
and counsel refused.  On the day after the default judgment was entered, GAC met with officials of the Government in Canada.  
GAC gave the court a report of that meeting, which stated that officials of the Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and 
Resources had informed GAC's representatives that there was no possibility that release of the cartel documents would be 
permitted by the Canadian Government, and that, in the opinion of the officials, simple identification of the documents without a 
summary of their contents was also prohibited by Canadian law.  One official stated that no Canadian court had decided the 
latter issue, although it was the Government's intention that such identification be prohibited.  However, in a Diplomatic Note 
sent to the United States on March 15, 1977, the Canadian Government stated that ""[t]he interpretation of the Regulations, 
including a determination of their scope, is a matter for Canadian courts."" Prior to entry of the default judgment on March 2, no 
Canadian court had addressed the question of the propriety of a simple identification of the documents, nor had GAC made any 
attempt to have a Canadian court decide the question."
140,123," However, as we have previously noted, as of the hearing on September 9, GAC had still not informed the court that it would 
not be able to produce all documents responsive to the Second Set of Interrogatories. "
141,124," GAC contends that this letter was sufficient because the Tenth Circuit had held on October 11 that Rio Algom's letter was an 
adequate attempt to secure a waiver.  In Re Westinghouse Elec. Corp. Uranium, Etc., supra, 563 F.2d at 999-1000. However, 
when Rio Algom wrote on June 23 it did not know what GAC was aware of on October 13 -- that the Minister would not consent 
to the release of the documents."
141,125," In addition to the Canadian Minister's refusals to grant waivers to Rio Algom and GAC, Canadian courts have refused to 
enforce letters rogatory to secure the cartel records.  See In the Matter of the Evidence Act, R.S.O.1970, c. 151 (and In Re 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation Uranium Contracts Litigation), 16 Ont.2d 273 (1977); Joe Clark v. Attorney General of 
Canada, 17 Ont.2d 593 (1977); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gulf Canada Ltd. (Sup.Ct. of Canada, slip op. March 18, 1980).  See also In Re 
Uranium Antitrust Litigation, supra, 480 F.Supp. at 1155. "
143,126," When the court agreed to consider Gregg's testimony ""for purposes of this motion,"" it invited GAC to submit a brief on the 
subject.  GAC did not.  On the day following the hearing, GAC wrote to the court, stating its understanding that the November 
hearing was limited to the question of whether it had complied with the court's order of October 11 to secure a waiver.  However, 
it enclosed materials which it said bore on United's other contentions, but none of the submissions were related to the housing 
issue."
143,127," In his deposition in this case, Gregg testified that Allen of Gulf Minerals sent cartel materials to Canada from Denver because 
""he thought it was material that was best kept in Canada or better kept in Canada."" In testimony before the Congressional 
subcommittee, Gregg was asked if there was any reason other than ""the need for secrecy"" that those materials were ""better 
kept"" in Canada.  He replied: ""None that I can think of."" Hearings on International Uranium Cartel, supra, Serial No. 95-39, p. 
271.  Hunter was asked in his deposition in this case if one of the reasons Gregg was transferred to Canada was ""the concern 
about the anti-trust laws of the United States."" He replied: ""Concern about all the documentation that would flow out of any

155,152," That GAC's and Gulf's inaction was not the result of any innocent misunderstanding is evidenced by the notes of the litigation 
strategy meeting held shortly after this case was filed.  Those notes, to which we have previously referred (see n.n. 32 and 81, 
supra), reflect that GAC and Gulf attorneys rejected a move to disqualify the Bigbee firm.  Those notes, taken by an associate 
general counsel of Gulf, contain these remarks: ""Move to disqualify Bigbee from UNC [United]?  . . . Don't if case gets before 
Judge Bratton."" (Emphasis in original.) Within a week of this meeting, GAC and Gulf filed a declaratory judgment and an 
interpleader action against United in federal court.  See n. 84, supra.  Both cases were assigned to Judge Bratton.  In neither 
case was a disqualification motion filed.  Judge Bratton dismissed both actions. "
156,153," In March 1977, GAC's counsel made it clear that GAC recognized that Gulf's activities were at issue.  Referring not to 
anything that had transpired in early 1977, but to ""[t]he fact that the first 53 paragraphs [of the complaint] relate to Gulf's 
misconduct,"" he told the trial court that ""Gulf is the main focal point of the action."" He went on to say: [N]early all of the misconduct alleged in the complaint was alleged misconduct on the part of Gulf before GAC was even 
formed.  It is not a question of Gulf doing things on behalf of the partnership. What they are being charged primarily with are 
things that happened before the partnership was even in existence."
156,154," It is hard to believe that GAC did not recognize that the Mt. Taylor reserves were an issue in this case until late February 
1977 when this Court had done so in October 1976.  United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., supra, 90 N.M. at 101, 560 
P.2d at 165."
156,155," In Westinghouse, the Court of Appeals held that there had been no legally effective consent by Gulf to the Bigbee firm's 
representation of United in that litigation because ""a client's consent will not justify the use of confidential information against the 
client."" 588 F.2d at 228. "
157,156," HN67[
] Section 38-3-9, N.M.S.A. 1978, provides that a judge may be disqualified by a party who files an affidavit alleging a ""belief"" that the judge cannot preside impartially.  Under this section a judge is automatically disqualified upon the filing of such 
an affidavit.  Norton v. Reese, 76 N.M. 602, 604, 417 P.2d 205, 207 (1966); Rivera v. Hutchings, 59 N.M. 337, 341, 284 P.2d 
222, 225 (1955). Thus, mere suspicion of bias or prejudice is a sufficient basis for the exercise of the statutory right of 
disqualification. State v. Scarborough, 75 N.M. 702, 713, 410 P.2d 732, 740 (1966) (Noble and Compton, JJ., dissenting).  
However, only one judge may be disqualified under that section, Gray v. Sanchez, 86 N.M. 146, 148, 520 P.2d 1091, 1093 
(1974); Beall v. Reidy, 80 N.M. 444, 447, 457 P.2d 376, 379 (1969), and a party must file the disqualification affidavit within the 
statutory time limitations set forth in Section 38-3-10, N.M.S.A. 1978, which are strictly construed.  Gerety v. Demers, 92 N.M. 
396, 401, 589 P.2d 180, 185 (1978). Because Judge Campos had already been disqualified, and because the motion to disqualify Judge Felter was not filed within 
the time limitations of Section 38-3-10, GAC had no statutory right to disqualify Judge Felter.  However, the right of 
disqualification provided by Section 38-3-9 is not the exclusive method of disqualification. See State v. Scarborough, supra, 75 
N.M. at 709, 410 P.2d at 736-37. But see Doe v. State, 91 N.M. 51, 52, 570 P.2d 589, 590 (1977). The guarantee of a fair and 
impartial tribunal, embodied in Article VI, ยง 18 and Canon 3(C)(1), and assured by the concept of due process, cannot be 
rendered meaningless by the limitations found in Sections 38-3-9 and 38-3-10.  However, though mere suspicion is a sufficient 
basis for disqualification under Section 38-3-9, the other methods require more, as we explain in this section of the opinion.  
Although not strictly limited by the time limitations of Section 38-3-10, a disqualification motion based on one of the non-statutory 
grounds must nevertheless be filed within a reasonable time after the party becomes aware of the grounds for it.  Cf.  In Re 
International Business Machines Corp., 618 F.2d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 1980) (construing similar federal provisions).  Because we 
find there was no basis to disqualify Judge Felter, we do not consider the question of the timeliness of GAC's motion. "
158,157," GAC had listed Zagnoli, who had represented Gulf at several cartel-related meetings, as a possible GAC witness at trial.  
United sought to have him appear to identify documents produced from Gulf files by GAC.  The court granted the motion to 
quash, but stated: I will not completely buy this nonparty corporate stonewall proposition.  The separate corporate identities and the rules 
relating to partnerships and so forth are not calculated to foment and bring about cover-ups and stonewalling information, 
and I am not going to permit them to be used that way. . . . . . . [I]t seems to me that General Atomic easily could have voluntarily brought about the appearance of Mr. Zagnoli here 
without any harm to themselves.  . . . But instead, it seems they desire to hide behind procedural and other rules in order to 
play a game of hide-and-go-seek with this Court, and I am getting sick of it.  . . . I don't think that you are acting in good faith at all in this regard.  I think you are trying to suppress information that could be 
brought to light and aid this Court.  . . ."
158,158," GAC does suggest that certain newspaper articles which discussed the favorable impact on the State of a judgment for 
United ""could have had a serious prejudicial effect on the court,"" and amounted to ""public pressure exerted through partisan 
appeals in the media."" This is the very type of ""indirect, remote, speculative, theoretical or possible interest"" which we have 
previously said is not sufficient to warrant disqualification under Article VI, ยง 18.  State v. Scarborough, supra, 75 N.M. at 705, 
410 P.2d at 734. The articles were clearly not ""partisan appeals."" GAC has not shown that Judge Felter ever read those articles.  
Furthermore, many of the rulings that GAC relies on to support its claim of bias were made before the articles were published.  It 
is difficult to believe that two innocuous newspaper articles had within two weeks of their publication transformed a judge, who 
GAC had said in May 1977 ""has certainly furnished us complete due process all along,"" into what it now describes as a ""patently 
hostile"" jurist, harboring ""personal grudges"" and incapable of ""calm impartial consideration."""
158,159," We do not mean to suggest that a judge's in-court conduct can never be relevant to show a personal bias or prejudice against 
a party which has an extrajudicial source.  See In Re International Business Machines Corp., supra, 618 F.2d at 928 n. 6. The 
critical distinction between an impermissible personal, extrajudicial bias, and in-court opinions was explained in United States v. 
Conforte, supra, 457 F.Supp. at 658 n. 12: The purpose of the extra-judicial source requirement concerns the origin of the judge's bias rather than the place of its 
expression.  Certainly, judicial rulings or comments on the evidence made during the course of a proceeding do not fall 
within the rule.  However, if a judge's statements or conduct during a trial refer to or reflect bias or prejudice which arose 
outside of his judicial duties, then the extrajudicial source rule is satisfied and recusal may be required. "
159,," The practical meaning of this distinction is perhaps best exemplified by comparing the statements and rulings which allegedly 
showed Judge Felter's bias with the in-court statements of the trial judge who was disqualified in United States v. Hatahley, 257 
F.2d 920, 925-26 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 899, 79 S.Ct. 222, 3 L.Ed.2d 148 (1958)."
159,160," GAC also argues that the fact that the recitals containing this language were adopted almost verbatim from the proposed 
findings of United demonstrates the judge's bias against it and in favor of United.  Although, as we have noted, this practice is 
not to be commended, it does not necessarily demonstrate that the judge acted in such a judicially irresponsible way as to 
require his disqualification. See Ramey Const. Co., Inc. v. Apache Tribe, Etc., supra, 616 F.2d at 468-69."
159,161," Not only is Judge Felter's description of GAC's conduct supported by the record, but also it was similar to language other 
courts have used to describe bad faith discovery efforts.  See, e.g., Fox v. Studebaker-Worthington, Inc., 516 F.2d 989, 991 (8th 
Cir.1975) (""shocking abuse,"" ""flagrant violations of the rules of discovery""); Conrad Music v. Modern Distributors, Inc., 433 
F.Supp. 269, 270 (C.D. Cal.1977) (""utter disdain,"" ""gross indifference,"" ""deliberate callousness""); Technograph Printed Cir. v. 
Packard Bell Electronics Corp., 290 F.Supp. 308, 320 (C.D. Cal.1968) (""wilful, intentional, and conscious flouting and 
disobedience,"" ""callous, cynical disdain""); Life Music, Inc. v. Broadcast Music, Inc., supra, 41 F.R.D. at 28 (S.D. N.Y.1966) 
(""deliberate flouting of this court's order,"" ""willful, intentional, and in bad faith,"" ""contumacious conduct calculated and designed 
to frustrate the order of this court,"" ""reprehensible and irresponsible in the extreme""). "
160,162," It is important to note that GAC moved to disqualify Judge Felter only after he had warned time and time again that he would 
impose sanctions for failure by either party to comply with the court's discovery orders; after he found in October 1977 that GAC 
had not previously acted in good faith in discovery; and after United had filed its fourth motion for sanctions.  This is not the first 
case in which a party faced with the imposition of sanctions for its discovery failures has sought to question the judge's integrity 
and impartiality.  State of Ohio v. Arthur Andersen & Co., supra, 570 F.2d at 1372; Henry v. Sneiders, 490 F.2d 315, 317-18 (9th 
Cir.1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 832, 95 S.Ct. 55, 42 L.Ed.2d 57 (1974); Pioche Mines Consolidated, Inc. v. Dolman, supra, 
333 F.2d at 259."
160,163," Canon 3(C)(1)(a) states that one instance in which a judge's impartiality ""might reasonably be questioned"" is where ""he has a 
personal bias or prejudice concerning a party."" (Emphasis added.) Because subsection (a) is not the only such instance, 
disqualification under Canon 3(C)(1) could also be required where the judge did not in fact have such a personal bias, but where 
there was nonetheless ""a reasonable factual basis"" for believing that he did.  However, for the reasons stated in the text, even in 
that instance the extrajudicial source requirement must be satisfied. "
161,164," Our determination that Judge Felter's disqualification was not mandated by Article VI, ยง 18 of the New Mexico Constitution or 
Canon 3(C)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct disposes of GAC's claim that its due process right to a fair trial was violated by 
Judge Felter's alleged bias against it.  Clearly, the right to ""[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process."" In 
Re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955). See also Beall v. Reidy, supra, 80 N.M. at 446, 457 
P.2d at 378. Although we cannot say that a judge's disqualification may never be required by the due process clauses of the 
United States and New Mexico Constitutions even though it is not also mandated by Article VI, ยง 18 of the State Constitution or 
Canon 3(C)(1), it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a claim sufficient under the latter two standards would not also 
satisfy the due process test.  See In Re International Business Machines Corp., supra, 618 F.2d at 932 n. 11; United States v. 
Haldeman, supra, 559 F.2d at 130 n. 276; United States v. Conforte, supra, 457 F.Supp. at 659 n. 13."
161,165," Upon the default, GAC is deemed to have admitted the allegations of the complaint, but the prevailing parties must prove the 
damages to which they are entitled.  Gallegos v. Franklin, supra, 89 N.M. at 123, 547 P.2d at 1165. "

177,2," In 1974, whenever the property of a utility subject to regulation by the New York Public Service Commission was condemned, 
Section 5-a of the N.Y. Condemnation Law required the condemnor to serve a copy of the petition on the PSC at least thirty 
days prior to the date set for a hearing on the petition.  This notification allowed the PSC to certify (for the condemnation court) 
the rate of return on the property to be condemned and the annual earnings that might reasonably be anticipated by the present 
owner.  Most of 1975 was consumed by this litigation. "

179,7," The demand upon an electric utility fluctuates significantly from hour to hour, day to day, and season to season.  An electric 
utility's generating capability is therefore geared to its peak load demand and designed to account for the fact that generating 
equipment will occasionally be out of service.  To meet these contingencies, a utility may build spinning, quick-start, and installed 
reserves equal to the capacity of its largest generating unit. An ""interconnection"" is simply a transmission line connecting two utilities which may be utilized in the event that either of them 
requires a reserve supply of electrical power to meet demands which exceed their generating capacity.  As a result, the major 
importance of an interconnection is that it reduces the need for an ""isolated"" utility to build and maintain expensive reserve 
generating capacity.  Gainesville Utilities Dept. v. Florida Power Corp., 402 U.S. 515, 518-520 n. 2 (1971). "
181,8," The simplest means of proving monopoly power is to marshal evidence showing the defendant's control over prices or 
exclusion of competition.  American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781 (1946); United States v. International Harvester 
Co., 274 U.S. 693, 708 (1927); United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417, 451 (1920). The courts have, however, 
often relied upon the defendant's market share as proof from which the existence of market power may be inferred.  United 
States v. Aluminum Company of America, 148 F. 2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945); United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571

Markets, 49 So. Cal. L. Rev. 154, 182-186 (1975). "
182,9," Niagara Mohawk's 115kv transmission lines in Massena are part of two separate 115kv transmission systems.  They are tied 
together by a switch in the ALCOA substation that can either put the two systems together (when it is closed) or keep them apart 
(when it is open).  When the switch is closed, the power flow is basically as illustrated above.  However, the switch is normally 
open (depending upon many factors, the most prominent of which is the availability of Canadian hydropower) and in that case 
the power in all probability back feeds from Niagara Mohawk's Raquette River generating facilities. "
183,10," The Other Tail Power Company argued unsuccessfully that this type of competition was beyond the Sherman Act's prohibition.  
See Brief For Appellant Otter Tail Power Company p. 73 n. 51; see also, City of Mishawaka v. American Electric Power Co., 616

184,13, This load is maintained with a 95% load factor.
184,14," PASNY also considered a direct tie to ALCOA's energized lines but concluded that ALCOA could not reasonably be expected 
to acquiesce in such an arrangement."
184,15," ALCOA and its subsidiaries own two high voltage transmission systems supplied from Canada.  The first of these lines is 
known as the ""cedars circuits."" They are leased to Niagara Mohawk and are not connected to ALCOA's PASNY circuits 
(although they are tied to the smelter through an emergency switch).  The second line is owned by an ALCOA subsidiary known 
as Long Sault.  This circuit is apparently independent as it supplies hydroelectric power generated in Ontario to New York 
utilities other than Niagara Mohawk.  There is, however, no evidence to suggest that ALCOA would be willing to share 
transmission facilities that are essential to its production."

U.S.C.  ยงยง 824-824h.  Interstate retail rates, on the other hand, are regulated by state agencies.  A result of this dual regulation 
is that wholesale rates may exceed retail rates.  Since municipally-owned utilities usually do not have their own generating 
facilities, they are compelled to purchase their bulk power requirements at wholesale from investor owned utilities.  Because the 
investor owned utilities also provide retail service, a ""price squeeze"" may occur if the wholesale rates approved for the investor 
owned utility are higher than the retail rates charged in the communities where they provide retail distribution service.  See City 
of Mishawaka v. American Electric Power Company, Inc., 616 F. 2d 976 (7th Cir. 1980). Towns of Alexandria, Minnesota v.

188,20," In United States v. Grinnell Corp ., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571 (1966), the Court explained the prerequisites of Section 2 liability in 
the following terms: ""The offense of monopolyโฆ has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful 
acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, 
business acumen, or historic accident."" Although, standing alone, this formulation is certainly plain enough, the remainder of the opinion reveals that a monopoly 
achieved or maintained through superior market performance is not ""willful."" It is therefore clear that the intent requirement 
searches for a corporate purpose to acquire or maintain monopoly power through unfair, exclusionary, or predatory means."

189,25," The company has attempted to persuade this Court that, because Massena's KWH sales in 1973 accounted for only one fifth 
of one percent of the system total, and because these sales generated only one quarter of one percent of the company's total 
revenues during that year, the municipal power movement in Massena could not reasonably be regarded as a significant threat 
to the company.  The credible evidence does not, however, support this argument, particularly since it ignores the fact that 
PASNY's present power commitment to Niagara Mohawk ends on January 1, 1990.  NS-1 Art. XIV.  At that time, potential 
preference customers throughout the Niagara Mohawk service area can petition the Authority for an allocation of the low cost 
hydroelectric power that had been committed to the defendant.  (Niagara Mohawk's 445,000kw replacement power commitment 
may, however, be extended to 2006 A.D.). "
190,26," The Bureau of Reclamation sold bulk power and since several of the rural electric cooperatives were apparently engaged in 
self-generation, 410 U.S. at 370 n. 3, the limitation was regarded as a horizontal restraint of trde."
190,27," A comparable limitation contained in Otter Tail's contracts with the rural electric cooperatives was also condemned by the 
Court. "
191,28," The Bureau of Reclamation sought to minimize the impact of the contractual limitation on Otter Tail's duty to wheel by arguing 
that the agreement merely required separate consideration of all subsequent applications, however, neither the District Court nor 
the Supreme Court accepted this rationale."
191,29," Market divisions such as these are condemned by the antitrust laws because competition is eliminated even more certainly 
than by price fixing which at least permits continuing nonprice competition."
191,30," Massena's argument that loads would not be altered by a mere change in ownership ignores the fact that it is Niagara 
Mohawk's inability to shift loads following municipalization that makes such changes necessary."
191,31," Contracts NS-1, Article IX, P1. "
192,32," Negotiation of a new wheeling rate has been underway for more than one year and it now appears that Niagara Mohawk may 
be permitted to increase its wheeling rates in the near future."
192,33, Otter Tail Brief p. 79.
192,34," Massena has argued that contract NS-1 also limits PANSY's ability to compete in the sale of bulk power generated by the 
Fitzpatrick nuclear plant.  Niagara Mohawk's obligation to wheel this power under contract UD-5 is not, however, subject to the 
territorial limitations of contract NS-1.  Consequently, the restrictions imposed by Article IX would not impair PASNY's capacity to 
compete in the sale of bulk power from the Fitzpatrick plant."
192,35," Inasmuch as the Court views the NS-1 limitation on an illegal restraint, it is unnecessary to address Massena's tie-in argument 
except to note that the company's demand for compensation on the basis of reproduction cost new less depreciation (RCNLD) is 
not indicative of predatory or anticompetitive intent. Massena argues that because the company will permit its consumers to ""purchase"" the distribution system through a Public 
Service Commission rate on the basis of original cost less depreciation, but insists upon RCNLD for an out-right sale, the 
company has illegally tied transmission service to continued reliance upon the Niagara Mohawk distribution system. The vice of a ""tie-in"" sale is that it employs economic coercion to reduce buyer choice and stifle competition in a market for the 
tied product.  Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 156 p. 445.  However, as the Supreme Court noted in Times-Picayune Publishing Company v. 
United States , 345 U.S. 594, 614 (1953): ""The common core of the adjudicated unlawful tying arrangements is the forced 
purchase of a second district commodity with the desired purchase of a dominant ""tying"" productโฆ"" See also, American 
Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. v. American Broadcasting Paramount Theatres, Inc ., 446 F. 2d 1131, 1137 (2d Cir.) cert. 
denied 404 U.S. 1063 (1972); Capital Temporaries, Inc. of Hartford v. Olsten Corp., 506 F. 2d 658 (2d Cir. 1974). The element of coercion is not present in this case because Massena has filed to prove that Niagara Mohawk's insistence upon 
RCNLD for its subtransmission equipment is sufficient to coerce Massena consumers into accepting the company's retail 
distribution service.  Indeed, even if the town purchased the Browning and Andrews substations (which Niagara Mohawk has 
offered to sell) at reproduction cost new less depreciation, its own exhibits show that it could still commence operations and offer 
its consumers a rate saving.  Furthermore since there is a substantial body of New York case law that would entitle Niagara 
Mohawk to compensation on the basis of RCNLD (Matter of the City of New York ) (Fifth Avenue Coadh Lines), 18 N.Y. 2d 212, 
221 (1966)8 22 N.Y. 2d 613, 619-20 (1968); Onondaga County Water Authority v. New York Water Service Corp ., 285 App. Div. "
193,655," , 662 (4th Dep't 1955), the alleged ""tie-in"" is involuntary to the extent that management is duty bound to seek the maximum 
allowable compensation for company property that is acquired through condemnation. The element of coercion that has 
traditionally justified judicial intolerance of tying arrangements is therefore absent and, in these circumstances, the Court is 
unable to infer predatory intent from Niagara Mohawk's offer to sell, rather than lease, its subtransmission equipment to 
Massena."
193,36," PASNY expressed confidence, based upon past negotiations with the company, that some reasonable accommodation could 
be made. "
194,37," Contract S-6 relates to the sale and delivery of St. Lawrence Project power.  This contract obligates Niagara Mohawk to wheel 
to all PANSY customers because there is no withdrawable St. Lawrence project power and at the time of its execution, all of the 
PASNY customers entitled to wheeling under S-6 were known, i.e., Niagara Mohawk was assuming a finite obligation even 
though the language of the agreement was sufficiently open ended to embrace any potential PASNY customer. Although the evidence has suggested that some of Massena's power may, from time to time, come from the St. Lawrence 
project, as an accounting matter it is only entitled to Niagara project power; and as a practical matter, it would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to chart the path of a given quantum of electricity West Texas Utilities Co. v. Texas Electric Service , 470 F. 
Supp. 798, 807 (N. D. Texas 1979)."
194,38," This opinion does not, however, support the proposition that a monopolist's refusal to provide access to essential facilities to 
foreclose competition can be justified by a potential competitor's threat to challenge its illegal conduct. "
195,39," Massena attempts to distingyish the Sherrill situation by suggesting that the acquisition did not diminish Niagara Mohawk's 
market share because retail service in the City had previously been supplied by a privte distribution system -- the Sherrill-
Kenwood Power & Light Company.  However, this argument ignores the fact that Sherrill-Kenewood had previously purchased 
its power from Niagara Mohawk.  Niagara Mohawk was therefore losing a purchaser of bulk power to its competitor, PASNY.  As 
a result, the distinction is without a basis in fact. "
197,40," Although several PASNY officials have expressed the view that a borderline agreement of this magnitude might be feasible, it 
is important to note that a May, 1978, memorandum to George Berry, PASNY's Director of Power Operations, stated that ""a 
case could be made that it (Niagara Mohawk) no longer has the flexibility to provide adequate and reliable service to these 
(borderline) customers."" Furthermore, as evidenced by their original plan and their proposal to sever as many of the St. Regis 
borderline customers as possible following the acquisition, Massena's own engineers have recognized the importance of 
reducing the number of borderline customers to manageable proportions."
197,41," HN21[
] The ""bottleneck"" or ""essential facilities"" cases hold that if a unique facility cannot practicably be duplicated by would-
be competitors, it must be made available to all on fair and reasonable terms.  Otter Tail Power Company v. United States, 
supra; Terminal Railroad Association v. United States, 224 U.S. 383 (1912); Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 570 F. 2d 982, 992 (9th 
Cir. 1977); Helix Milling Co. v. Terminal Flour Mills Co., 523 F. 2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1053 (1976); 
United States v. Standard Oil Co., 362 F. Supp. 1331, 1341, aff'd, 412 U.S. 924 (1973); Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National

Produce Building, Inc., 194 F. 2d 484 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 817 (1952). To be ""essential"" a facility need not be 
indispensable; it is enough that its duplication would be economically infeasible and that the denial of access to it would severely 
handicap potential market entrants.  As noted supra, these elements are present in this case and Niagara Mohawk's 
transmission network can easily be characterized as an ""essential facility"", vis-a-vis Massena's attempt to enter the retail 
distribution market. "
198,42," Fairport receives its deliveries as two points because this arrangement enhanced the capacity of Niagara Mohawk's cross

199,44, Each of these loads exceeds 7.5mw except Oneida-Madison.

202,47," Justice Douglas did not attempt to define the parameters of the ""sham exception"", but instead listed several examples of 
activity that might fall within it: ""Perjury of witnesses is one example.  Use of a patent obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor from the market may involve a 
violation of the antitrust laws, as we held in Walker Process Equipment [Inc.] v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp ., 382 U.S. 
172, 175-77 [86 S. Ct. 347, 349-50, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247]. Conspiracy with a licensing authority to eliminate a competitor may also 
result in an antiturst transgression.  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp ., 370 U.S. 690, 707 [82 S. Ct. 1404, 
1414, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777]; Harman v. Valley National Bank , 339 F. 2d 564 (CA 9 1964).Similarly, bribery of a public purchasing 
agent may constitute a violation of ยง 2(c) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.  Rangen, Inc. v. Sterling 
Nelson & Sons , 351 F. 2d 851 (CA 9 1965). There are many other forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes and 
which may result in antitrust violations.  Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the 
adjudicatory process.  Opponents before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other's tacts, motions, or defenses and may 
readily call them baseless.  One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of 
baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the fact finder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes 
have been abused.  That may be a difficult line to discern and draw.  But once it is drawn, the case is established that abuse of 
those processes produced an illegal result, viz ., effectively barring respondents from access to the agencies and courts.  Insofar 
as the administrative or judicial processes are involved, actions of that kind cannot acquire immunity by seeking refuge under the 
umbrella of 'political expression.'"" 404 U.S. at 512-13. "
203,48," Although some courts have held that a single lawsuit may form the basis for a finding of sham litigation, Colorado Petroleum 
Marketers Association v. Southland Corp., 476 F. Supp. 373, 378 (D. Colo. 1979); Technicon Medical Information Systems 
Corp. v. Greenbay Packaging, Inc ., 1980-1 TRADE CASES P63,025 (D. Wisc. 1979); Cyborg Systems, Inc. v. Management 
Science of America, Inc ., 1978-1 TRADE CASES P61,927 (N.D. Ill. 1978); the Supreme Court's opinion in California Motor 
Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited , 404 U.S. 508, 513 (1972) clearly states that a litigation strategy may give rise to Sherman 
Act liability only if it amounts to ""a pattern of baseless repetitive claims"" evidencing access preclusion and abuse of the 
adjudicatory process.It would appear to make little difference whether this ""pattern"" develops during the course of a single 
lawsuit (cf.  Vendo Co. v. Lektro Vend Corp ., 433 U.S. 623, 636 n. 6 (1977)), or is revealed through repeated actions.  Otter Tail 
Power Company v. United States, supra; Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon Inc ., 601 F. 2d 986 (9th Cir. 1979). It is, however, apparent 
that a ""pattern"" of baseless repetitive litigation designed to prevent meaningful access to an adjudicatory tribunal is prerequisite 
to Sherman Act liability. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Niagara Mohawk's defenses could fairly be characterized in this manner."
203,49," Indeed, Massena has successfully issued its municipal bonds. "
204,50," Although Niagara Mohawk's claim for compensation on the basis of reproduction cost new less depreciation does not reveal 
anticompetitive intent because it is arguably supported by New York law, this Court does not intend to suggest tacit approval of 
this valuation formula.  Indeed, sound policy consideration suggests that strict adherence to the RCNLD formula would, in the 
context of a public acquisition of depreciated utility property, result in unjust enrichment and be contrary to the public interest. "
205,51," An October 9, 1974, memorandum prepared within the defendant's law department indicates skepticism concerning the 
success of an argument that was ultimately rejected by the New York courts.  Read in context, it is clear that this memorandum 
was precisely what it was intended to be, viz. an objective analysis of an argument recommended by outside counsel.  It does 
not, however, suggest a strategy of delay, nor does it reveal the company's willingness to pursue a course that was plainly 
contrary to law.  Indeed, if this document was sufficient to establish monopolistic intent, no in-house counsel for a firm with 
monopoly power could question the advice of counsel without risking exposure to antitrust liability if this criticism was ultimately 
accepted by courts. "
207,52," It would appear from the credible evidence that the people of the Town of Massena were not accurately informed concerning 
the public power movement in their community.  For example, it is doubtful that the general public realized the manner in which 
some of the signatures on the petitions were obtained and their authenticity.  Nor is it likely that many people in the community 
realized, when it was important, that most of the letters to the editor favoring public power had been written by one man.  More 
importantly, the credible evidence has shown that the Citizens Advisory Committee was predisposed towards public power and 
favored its advocates.  A more careful review of the cost analysis of both sides might have led to sufficient funding so as to 
enable more meaningful settlement negotiations and hence savings in time and money. "
208,53," In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co ., 273 U.S. 359 (1927), the Court affirmed a finding of illegal 
monopolization when a monopolist refused to deal in furtherance of a plan to drive its competitors from the marketplace. Id . at 
375. Specifically, the Court found that Kodak had monopoly power in a national wholesale market for certain photographic 
supplies.  In an effort to extend its market dominance through vertical integration into the retail distribution market, it began 
buying out distributors.  If a distributor refused Kodak's offer, the defendant would simply terminate its wholesale supply 
agreement thereby coercing a sale of the distributorship.  The Court held that these facts would permit an inference that the 
defendant's refusal to deal was purposely intended to extend its monopoly power. Refusals to deal, analyzed in this manner, 
have therefore been characterized as relying upon a subjective analysis of the monopolist's intent.  This approach is often 
compared with an objective analysis which is characteristic of the ""essential facility"" or ""bottleneck"" cases.  Mid-Texas 
Communications Systems, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co ., 615 F. 2d at 1387-1388 n. 12; Byars v. Bluff City News 
Co., Inc ., 609 F. 2d at 855-857; Note, Refusald to Deal by Vertically Integrated Monopolists, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1720, 1732-51 
(1974). The distinction is, however, largely academic because a subjective analysis necessarily depends upon inferences drawn 
from objective behavior such as the circumstances surrounding the refusal to deal, its exclusionary impact, the justification 
advanced, and the presence or absence of less restrictive alternatives. "
209,54," Nevertheless, if the Town of Massena renews its threat to commence operations before this decision has been reviewed by

228,12," .  Plaintiff did not seek a restraining order or preliminary injunction presumably because the boycott had terminated before the 
action was instituted. "
244,1," .  At oral argument, counsel for THI candidly admitted that no factual opposition was filed contesting the motion for summary 
judgment and that no request was made of the district judge for additional time to conduct discovery in an effort to meet and 
factually oppose the summary judgment motion. When asked why no opposition was filed and no request for discovery was made, counsel replied, ""I didn't think the judge would 
grant the motion."" It is difficult to muster sympathy for counsel in the face of the plain language of Rule 56.  Nevertheless, we 
have thoroughly considered defendants' factual showing in support of the summary judgment motion in order to determine 
whether the facts presented justified granting the motion as a matter of law."

251,2," Article XX(d)(1) of the 1974 Agreement reads as follows, except that the specified rates of contribution have been eliminated: During the life of this Agreement, for the periods of time indicated below, each signatory Employer engaged in the production of 
coal shall contribute to the Trusts established in this Article the amounts specified below based on cents per ton on each ton of 
two thousand (2,000) pounds of bituminous coal produced by such Employer for use or for sale, and, in addition, each signatory 
Employer (including those engaged in the production of coal and those not engaged in the production of coal) shall contribute to 
the Trusts established in this Article the amounts specified below based on cents per hour worked by each of the Employer's 
Employees who perform classified work under this Agreement. In addition to the contributions indicated above, during the life of the Agreement, each signatory Employer shall, for the periods 
of time indicated below, contribute to the Trusts established in this Article in the amounts shown below based on cents per ton 
on each ton of two thousand (2,000) pounds of bituminous coal after production by another operator, procured or acquired by 
such Employer for use or for sale on which contributions to the appropriate Trusts as provided for in this Article have not been 
made (amounts shown below include cents per hour worked contributions converted to tonnage equivalents): The parties hereto mutually agree that, if at any time during the term of this Agreement a court or tribunal of competent 
jurisdiction determines by a final decision that is not appealable that the provision appearing in the paragraph just preceding is 
invalid or in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 1947, as amended, or other Federal or state law, the parties shall, at "
252,," the option of and upon demand by the Union without affecting the integrity of any other provision of this Section or any other 
provision of the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement, meet and engage in good faith negotiations to agree upon a clause 
to be inserted into this Agreement in replacement of the provision found invalid or unlawful. Article XXIX(b) of the 1974 Agreement reads as follows: In the event the parties are restrained or prohibited by any agency or branch of the federal or state government from 
implementing or effectuating the economic benefits, including health and retirement fund payments, required by this Agreement, 
either party hereto may, after the imposition of such restraint, give sixty days notice of termination of this Agreement and, 
thereafter shall meet and discuss and attempt to agree on the basis for a continuation of the Agreement for its term. If no 
agreement is reached within the 60-day period, the Agreement will terminate."
252,3," There is a dispute as to when the Trustees first found out about Kaiser's outside purchases. Kaiser insists that the Trustees 
knew all along about such purchases but declined to bring suit until the Agreement had expired. The Trustees reply that they 
discovered the problem only in late 1977, when the Agreement was at or near completion. Because this is an appeal from 
summary judgment, we must assume that Kaiser's version of this disputed fact is correct. We note, however, that the relevance 
of that fact to the legal issues on appeal is marginal."
252,4," In the district court, Kaiser offered affirmative defenses other than its claims of illegality. These other defenses were summarily 
denied, and Kaiser has not raised them on this appeal."
252,5," There is, in fact, good reason to think that the purchase-of-coal clause is consistent with both federal antitrust and federal labor 
law. Because there is a ""strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate competition over wages and 
working conditions,"" courts will sometimes tolerate that ""lessening of business competition"" which necessarily results from a 
union's success in standardizing workers' pay.  Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 95 S. Ct. 
1830, 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1976). In American Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 88 S. Ct. 1562, 20 L. Ed. 2d 
460 (1968), for example, the Supreme Court upheld against an antitrust challenge a union regulation requiring all orchestra 
leaders to charge their customers the same minimum rates, a rule which lessened wage competition among the musicians 
whom the orchestra leaders hired. Over the years, courts have drawn under the ambit of the labor exemption to the antitrust "
253,," laws union protective devices having much greater anticompetitive effects than the purchase-of-coal clause here under review. 
See Granddad Bread, Inc. v. Continental Baking Co., 612 F.2d 1105 (9th Cir. 1979); California Dump Truck Owners Ass'n v. 
Associated General Contractors, 562 F.2d 607 (9th Cir. 1977); Iodice v. Calabrese, 512 F.2d 383 (2d Cir. 1975); Intercontinental 
Container Transport Corp. v. New York Shipping Ass'n, 426 F.2d 884 (2d Cir. 1970). In fact, one district court has already held 
that the purchase-of-coal clause itself does not violate the Sherman Act. United States Steel Corp. v. International Union, UMW, 
C.A. No. 75-1966 (D.D.C. Oct. 5, 1977). Comparable considerations apply to the alleged ""hot cargo"" violation. The Supreme Court has cautioned against reading the 
NLRA's prohibitions against secondary boycott activities by unions in a way that would preclude pressuring employers to 
improve their employees' wages, hours, and working conditions.  National Woodwork Manufacturing Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 
612, 643, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 1267, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967). It can no longer be doubted that a union does not run afoul of section 
8(e) merely by insisting on a ""union standards"" clause, that is, one which prohibits an employer from subcontracting work to 
other employers whose economic benefits and working standards are not commensurate with those of the union's collective 
bargaining agreement. E. g., Teamsters Local 216 v. NLRB (Bigge-Drayage), 171 U.S. App. D.C. 440, 520 F.2d 172, 177-78 
(D.C.Cir.1975); Local 433, Carpenters v. NLRB, 166 U.S. App. D.C. 114, 509 F.2d 447, 452-53 (D.C.Cir.1974); Truck Drivers 
413 v. NLRB, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 149, 334 F.2d 539, 548 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 916, 85 S. Ct. 264, 13 L. Ed. 2d 186 
(1964); Orange Belt Dist. Council of Painters v. NLRB, 117 U.S. App. D.C. 233, 328 F.2d 534, 537-39 (D.C.Cir.1964). Even a 
clause that, by economic disincentives, serves to dissuade an employer from subcontracting below ""union standards"" does not 
necessarily violate section 8(e).  George Ryan Co. v. NLRB, 609 F.2d 1249, 1254 (7th Cir. 1979). It may well be that the 
provision Kaiser challenges here is a kind of ""union standards"" clause and, hence, lawful under section 8(e). In fact, another 
employer signatory of the 1974 Agreement has previously charged that the purchase-of-coal clause violates section 8(e), but the 
Board's General Counsel refused to issue a complaint. International Union, UMW (Consolidated Coal Co.), NLRB Case No. 6-
CE-17 (March 28, 1979). The implication of this action is that the General Counsel did not regard the claim as ""sufficiently 
meritorious to warrant Board consideration."" NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 139, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 1511, 44 L. Ed. 
2d 29 (1975). In any event, the issue of the legality of the clause cannot be addressed finally in this lawsuit."
253,6," The dissent contends that a court confronted with the allegation of contract illegality can enforce the disputed clause only in 
two cases: (1) if it concludes that the clause is legal notwithstanding the allegation to the contrary or (2) if it assumes (or 
concludes) that the clause is illegal as alleged but enforceable nevertheless.  Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1321-1322. We do 
not believe, however, that this exhausts the possibilities. As a third alternative, the court can simply refuse to entertain the 
illegality defense. See Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Tandem Prods. Inc., 526 F.2d 593, 600 (2d Cir. 1975) (sustaining district judge's 
""refusal to consider (defendant's) proffered antitrust defense""). Accordingly, we here decide neither that the purchase-of-coal 
clause was legal nor that it is enforceable notwithstanding its illegality but only that the district court properly declined to entertain 
the defense. The dissent also contends that the illegality of the disputed clause must be assumed because this is an appeal from a summary 
judgment. Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1322-1323, 1331. This, however, confuses allegations of fact with legal conclusions 
drawn from those facts. See generally 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1368, at 692-93 (1969). Neither 
case law nor analysis supports the proposition that on appeal from summary judgment, the court must accept as correct the 
losing party's assertions as to the legality of a disputed contract clause. Moreover, it is not accurate to say-as our dissenting 
colleague does-that judgment for the Trustees in this case would ""enforce a contract clause which plainly violates the law."" 
Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1320 (emphasis added). For even if all of Kaiser's factual allegations are true, the purported 
illegality of the disputed clause is far from clear. See note 5 supra. "
255,7," At times a court will look to the underlying purpose and effect of a contract to determine whether it is so contrary to public 
policy that the contract will not be enforced. That is essentially what the Court did in McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U.S. 639, 653-54, 
19 S. Ct. 839, 844, 43 L. Ed. 1117 (1899), in which enforcement of a written partnership contract was denied because it was part 
of a larger oral agreement to bid collusively on certain public works projects. But if Kelly is to mean anything, it must mean that 
such an inquiry is not permitted when it is asserted as an affirmative defense that the contract sued on contravenes federal 
antitrust law."
255,8," We cannot accept the dissent's assertion that the payments at issue here were ""unearned"" and that Kaiser's workers were 
paid fully for the work they did even though contractually-required payments were not made.  Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 
1326. The economic rationality and legal propriety of the purchase-of-coal clause is not suspect just because it measures 
welfare fund contributions by the amount of coal the employer buys from someone else. We know of nothing in reason or federal 
labor law that requires workers to measure their rate of compensation solely by the number of hours performed or the output of 
their employer. In Walsh v. Schlecht, 429 U.S. 401, 97 S. Ct. 679, 50 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1977), there was at issue a clause in a collective bargaining 
agreement that required an employer to contribute to a union employee-benefit fund at a rate of 96 cents per hour for carpentry 
work done by non-union workers employed by a subcontractor, which was not itself a signatory of the collective bargaining 
agreement. The Court enforced the agreement even though the subcontractor's employees were not beneficiaries of the fund 
and even though the signatory employer had already paid those employees wages at the union scale plus an extra 96 cents per 
hour as a fringe benefit. The Supreme Court apparently saw no unfairness in this result; we see none here. It is not unfair to Kaiser that it be required to contribute to the UMW funds after having indirectly paid a comparable amount to 
other workers, see Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1326, for this is exactly what it contracted to do. Neither would enforcing the 
contract as written create a ""windfall"" for the Trustees. See id. It is in the nature of employee-benefit funds like all transfer-
payment schemes that benefits to some are funded by contributions from others. And it is often the case that payments to 
beneficiaries do not perfectly correspond to the amount of work they themselves have done. Attempting to ensure the continued 
viability of such funds by broadening the base of contribution is often actuarially sound. "
256,," If the contributions sought had not already been earned by performance, then the Trustees' claim for contract enforcement in this 
context would have had less force. See Huge v. Long's Hauling Co., supra, 590 F.2d at 460; Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls 
Corp., 340 F.2d 753 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 820, 86 S. Ct. 47, 15 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1965); Pennington v. United Mine 
Workers, 325 F.2d 804, 818 (6th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 949, 85 S. Ct. 1796, 14 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1965). That, however, 
is not this case."
256,9," To distinguish this case from Kelly, the dissent propounds an analogy between the purchase-of-coal here and the nondelivery 
agreement alluded to in Kelly. Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1324-1325. That analogy, however, is fundamentally 
misconceived. In Kelly the Court distinguished the nondelivery agreement (i. e., the agreement to withhold onions from the market) from the 
contract for the sale of onions. The former, it said, could not be enforced if violative of the antitrust law. 358 U.S. at 521, 79 S. 
Ct. at 432. The latter would be enforced even though it was allegedly in furtherance of the monopolistic scheme. The analogue 
to the nondelivery agreement in this case is not the purchase-of-coal clause, as the dissent asserts, but rather the alleged 
agreement to boycott non-UMW coal producers. An agreement like that between a union and group of employers is violative of 
the antitrust law, see United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), and is 
unenforceable under the Kelly rule. In contrast, the purchase-of-coal clause (like the sale contract for onions) is enforceable 
under Kelly even though its alleged purpose and effect was to further an illegal boycott plan. The dissent seems to be of the view that the purchase-of-coal clause is a ""penalty"" on its face simply because ""nonunion parties 
receive no benefits"" from its operation. See Dissenting Opinion 642 F.2d at 1325. We disagree. See note 8, supra. On its face, 
and apart from any consideration of its purpose and effect in a particular context, the purchase-of-coal clause ""constitutes an 
intelligible economic transaction in itself."" Kelly, 358 U.S. at 521, 79 S. Ct. at 432. Accordingly, Kelly requires that the illegality 
defense be disallowed. "
257,10," United States Steel Corp. v. International Union, UMW, C.A. No. 75-1966 (D.D.C., filed Nov. 24, 1975, decided Oct. 5, 1977) 
(judgment that Sherman Act not violated by purchase-of-coal clause)."
257,11," Ordinarily, one thinks of the doctrine of unclean hands as the sin of the plaintiff he who ""comes to court with unclean hands."" 
But the doctrine can also apply when the plaintiff establishes a right at law and the defendant attempts to interpose a defense 
which, like the defense of illegality, is overlaid with equitable considerations. See H. McClintock, Handbook of Principles of 
Equity 65 (1948). "
261,12," Kaiser argues that the contrary is indicated by a comment of Justice Stewart in Connell. So, too, does the dissent.  Dissenting 
Opinion 642 F.2d at 1333. But the comment referred to was made in a footnote to Justice Stewart's dissent in that case, 421 
U.S. at 649 n.9, 95 S. Ct. at 1849 n.9, and is not controlling here. More important, the comment, when read in context, is not 
inconsistent with the view expressed in this opinion. Justice Stewart addresses in his footnote the legal consequences that befall an employer who signs voluntarily a ""hot cargo"" 
clause. He notes that if the employer complies with the clause and refuses to deal with another business, that business may 
have a valid antitrust action against the boycotting or ""neutral"" employer. This possible liability for damages can be avoided, 
Justice Stewart says, simply by the employer's refusal to comply with the ""hot cargo"" clause. He then concludes, ""Since ยง 8(e) 
provides that any prohibited agreement is ""unenforceable and void,' any union effort to invoke legal processes to compel the 
neutral employer to comply with his purely voluntary agreement would obviously be unavailing."" 421 U.S. at 649 n.9, 95 S. Ct. at 
1848. Taken in context, all this means is that the court will not compel an employer to engage in conduct violative of the antitrust law 
by granting specific performance of an illegal, ""hot cargo"" clause. See 642 F.2d at 1312, supra. However, the case here under 
review is not a suit for specific performance but for payment of a sum owing and due. A court order compelling Kaiser to make 
payments to the Trustees now that the 1974 Agreement has expired would not force Kaiser to do anything prohibited by either 
section 8(e) or the Sherman Act and would not subject Kaiser to antitrust liability from someone else. The problem Justice 
Stewart was addressing in his footnote does not arise. "
262,13," The ""unenforceable and void"" language was first introduced during floor debate by Senator Smathers in an amendment that 
would also have brought section 8(e) violations within the mandatory injunction provisions of section 10(l ). 105 Cong.Rec. 6033 
(daily ed. Apr. 25, 1959), reprinted in II Legislative History of The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, at 
1242 (1959) (hereinafter cited as Legis.Hist.) Senator Smathers' remarks clearly show that it was his understanding that the 
policing mechanism for section 8(e) violations would be the mandatory injunction provisions of section 10(l ). See id. Remarks by 
Senator Goldwater some weeks later reflect a similar understanding. 105 Cong.Rec. 9118 (col. 2) (daily ed. June 8, 1959), 
reprinted in II Legis.Hist. at 1290. In the course of debate, several legislators remarked that what is now section 8(e) would make 
""hot cargo"" clauses ""unenforceable and void,"" but very rarely did these legislators clearly articulate what they thought that 
meant. The most substantial support for the view that ""hot cargo"" illegality might be raised as an affirmative defense in a contract 
enforcement suit is found in a statement by Senator Goldwater, in which he said: (Section 8(e)) means that (""hot cargo"") contractual clauses are per se illegal. It is unlawful for either party even to execute such 
an agreement, to insist that the other party bargain about or enter into it, to use any form of coercion or restraint economic or 
otherwise to compel the other party to enter into it or to live up to it even if his refusal to do so is in breach of a voluntary 
agreement to abide by the agreement, and finally, such breach does not constitute a good cause of action in a suit at law to 
recover damages for the breach or to secure specific performance of the agreement."
262,105," Cong.Rec. A8523 (col. 3) (daily ed. Oct. 2, 1959), reprinted in II Legis.Hist. at 1857. This statement was included in an 
""extension of remarks""-not something actually said in the course of legislative debate but rather a statement appended to the 
official record at some other time-after the bill had already been signed into law. The statement is not inconsistent with our 
construction of section 8(e). Whether a union can obtain specific performance, or even damages for breach, on a contract that is 
still executory and clearly violative of section 8(e) is a different question from whether the trustees of a welfare fund may recover 
money due on a contract already fully performed on the union side and only arguably violative of section 8(e). Accordingly, 
Senator Goldwater's statement is not controlling evidence of congressional intent as to the meaning of the ""unenforceable and 
void"" language of section 8(e), as that language relates to the issue on this appeal. "

267,26," The court questions in footnote 6 of the majority opinion whether ""the illegality of the disputed clause must be assumed 
because this is an appeal from a summary judgment,"" citing 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1368, at 
692-93 (1969). That authority, id. at 693, states, however, that: In addition to assuming the truthfulness of the actual allegations for purposes of the motion, all reasonable inferences and 
intendments from these facts are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. (citations omitted) In National Labor Board v. Weirton 
Steel Company, (146 F.2d 144 (3d Cir. 1944)), for example, the NLRB brought a contempt proceeding for violation of a decree 
involving certain unfair labor practices and moved for a partial summary judgment on the pleadings. The Third Circuit refused to 
grant the motion, although it recognized that by drawing certain inferences from the facts, the conclusion sought by the Board 
might be supported. The court stated; but, a court is without right to draw inferences favorable to a movement for summary judgment on (the) pleadings. In that 
situation, all reasonable intendments and inferences from the pleadings are, as a matter of law, to be taken against the 
movement and in favor of the opponent. ( Id. at 145) Surely, the manifest implications in Kaiser's pleadings would support judicial inference regarding the antitrust defense. These 
inferences are sufficient to vitiate the propriety of the district judge's refusal to entertain the antitrust defense without receiving 
any proof at all of the subject."
267,27," The majority's discussion of Kelly is simply conclusory. Though the majority purports not to be examining the application of 
the Sherman Act to the contract clause at issue in this litigation, footnotes 5-7 to the court's opinion appear to assume sub rosa 
an antitrust holding favoring appellees. This is inappropriate in an appeal taken from a summary judgment granted below, when 
the trial court never reached the question of illegality. Nevertheless, their reliance on Kelly in this case, where enforcement of the 
clause in question has the necessary effect of restraining trade with nonunion coal producers, is totally indefensible, whatever 
the ultimate decision on the merits on other grounds."
267,28," In order to compete for business from designatories, nonsignatories must lower their prices to make it economically feasible 
for UMWA operators to pay the purchase price and make a contribution to the health and pension funds as well. "
268,29," The trustees argue that because Kaiser continued to make purchases from nonsignatories, ""there was no boycott of nonunion 
coal producers."" Therefore, they submit the clause does not lead to conduct proscribed by the Sherman Act, and the exception 
to Kelly is inapplicable. Brief for Appellees at 27. In other words, the trustees argue that the antitrust defense may not be raised 
because there was no antitrust violation. And Kaiser may not prove the antitrust violation because the antitrust defense may not 
be raised. This is blatant circular reasoning and is unacceptable. That Kaiser continued to make purchases from nonunion coal companies does not prove that the purchase-of-coal clause had 
no deterrent effects. It may well be that the only reason Kaiser did so was that it believed it would not have to pay the purchase-
of-coal ""penalty,"" and therefore did not take that into consideration in its purchasing decisions. In any event, Kaiser should first 
be allowed to make its case that the clause had anticompetitive effects before a court concludes on summary judgment that the 
defense must be disallowed because no violation occurred."
268,30," Are natural consequences of intended acts irrelevant? More sophisticated scrutiny would not so blithely overlook the 
necessary effects of the clause cooked up by the union. The effects of that clause are clearly injurious to nonunion producers 
and their employees. The majority opinion, reluctant to draw inferences about the anticompetitive character of the clause, is 
much quicker to draw the inference that the purchase-of-coal clause was intended to counteract wage competition among coal 
producers, see footnote 5 of the majority opinion. The ""wage competition"" issue diverts attention away from the proper focus for attention on this appeal. There has been no 
finding whatsoever that the employees of nonunion producers received less advantageous wages than unionized employees. 
Moreover, courts have traditionally looked beyond the facial appearance of challenged activities. In United States v. Socony-
Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940), the Supreme Court labeled as price fixing a concerted 
program whereby oil companies entered the oil market as buyers. The Court held that this buying program represented price 
fixing, a per se violation of the Sherman Act. The violation resulted from the necessary effect that the program would have on 
prices. It is important to note that the necessary effect was proscribed regardless of whether ""the conspirators had the means 
available for accomplishment of their objective."" Id. at 225 n.59, 60 S. Ct. at 845. Here, just as in Socony-Vacuum, the 
anticompetitive effect can be inferred from the consequences logically entailed by the operation of the purchase-of-coal clause. 
The following quote from Sullivan, Antitrust 313 (1977) is informative: (W)here the course agreed upon is not explicitly to fix prices or divide territories, there may also be, as there was in Socony-
Vacuum, inference involved in the conclusion that the purpose and effect of what was expressly agreed upon is tantamount to 
price fixing or market division or that the purpose and effect (though not capable of being assimilated under one of the per se 
violations) is nevertheless unreasonable. (footnote omitted) Inference, be it understood, may be involved in one or more of 
several steps in the analysis, in deciding that an agreement took place, in concluding that the agreement which did take place 
should be characterized in a way which offends a per se rule, or in concluding that the agreement is, on balance, unreasonable."
268,31," 358 U.S. at 521, 79 S. Ct. at 432. The majority opinion confounds the ostensible purpose of the purchase-of-coal clause and its necessary effects. The majority 
writes in footnote 9: ""On its face, and apart from any consideration of its purpose and effect in a particular context, the purchase-
of-coal clause ""constitutes an intelligible economic transaction in itself.' Kelly, 358 U.S. at 521, 79 S. Ct. at 432. Accordingly, 
Kelly requires that the illegality defense must be disallowed."" This is another instance of the majority's failing to recognize that 
however ""intelligible"" the purchase-of-coal clause is, it is itself the offensive clause under the antitrust laws. When the court "
269,," enforces this clause it promotes the necessary effects of the clause and harms the economic interests of both sellers and buyers 
of nonunion coal. The antitrust violation is implicit in the purchase-of-coal clause itself; there is no allegation that any other part 
of the collective bargaining agreement between the union and Kaiser is violative of the antitrust laws."

269,35," The court states (at footnote 5): ""It may well be that the provision Kaiser challenges here is a kind of ""union standards' clause 
and, hence, lawful under section 8(e)."" But there is no issue in this case of pension benefits ""below union standards."" It must be 
assumed that the price Kaiser pays for coal it buys from nonunion producers includes a component attributable to the pension 
benefits the nonunion producers pay their employees. The clause at issue only prejudices the nonunion producers by making 
their coal less attractive to Kaiser; and prejudices Kaiser by constraining its opportunity to choose coal suppliers for itself. 
Though the majority writes ""(i)t may well be โฆ"", there is no evidence that this clause was a ""union standards"" clause, and such

provision intended to benefit the trusts which they administer. Kaiser's challenge of the purchase-of-coal clause, which takes the 
form of an affirmative defense, is a matter to be decided at law, not equity. A curious point, however, is that the trustee's legal position has been that they had no notice that Kaiser made no reports or 
payments in accordance with the terms of the purchase-of-coal clause. Surely this failure to be currently informed of matters 
pertaining to the employee pension fund manifests a problem for the trustees or this court when they rely upon ""equitable

275,73," Footnote 5 of the majority opinion suggests that a union's anticompetitive acts are broadly protected by labor law exemptions 
to the antitrust law. To be sure, there are statutory and implied labor exemptions for some anticompetitive activity, but the 
exemptions at most only cover lawful labor practices. See Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Ass'n, Inc. (Conex),

exemption. Once it is clear that a ยง 8(e) violation has occurred no labor policy is advanced by permitting on-going operation of 
an illegal contract โฆ."" Id. at 519. Though the NLRB had made a previous determination that the contract clause in Conex 
violated ยง 8(e), and the court decided to give collateral estoppel effect to the NLRB's determination, id. at 511-12, the implication 
of that court's collateral estoppel analysis is that it assumed a district court would certainly have jurisdiction to consider the 
legality of labor practices and whether they violate the antitrust laws."

276,," The majority opinion cites at 1306 International Union, United Mine Workers of America and Bituminous Coal Operators 
Association, 188 N.L.R.B. 753 (26 Feb. 1971) (Supplemental Decision and Order) for the proposition that ""hot cargo"" clauses 
are not plainly violative of section 8(e). There, the Board held lawful a clause within a collective bargaining agreement between 
coal miners and coal operators which required the signatory operators to make certain payments to the union for coal they 
obtained by subcontracting work out to nonsignatory mines. The Board affirmed the Trial Examiner's findings that ""the intent of 
the parties in adopting the 80-cent clause was to equalize the differences in the costs of wage and fringe benefits generally 
existing between mines signatory to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement and those which are not in order to protect 
the work opportunities and standards provided UMW members employed by signatory operators"" and ""that wage, fringe, and 
working condition standards of employees in nonsignatory mines are generally lower than those established in the National 
Bituminous Coal Wage Agreementโฆ."" Id. at 753. The Board wrote that: ""The validity of a union standards clause lies in the fact 
that it removes the economic incentive to subcontract unit work to employers maintaining substandard conditions of employment 
which enable such employers to perform the work at cheaper labor costs.  Id. at 754. Here, the factor of ""union standards"" and 
the intention to propogate them are completely missing. There have been no findings that the intent of the parties was to protect 
the wages and working conditions of the union members, or that there was in fact a disparity in the benefits, etc., received by 
union as compared with nonunion employees. See notes 30 and 35 supra. Moreover, in the cited NLRB precedent, Chairman 
Miller and member Brown dissented strongly. They stated: The lawfulness of the clause does not depend upon the parties' subjective intent in executing the clause or upon their conduct in 
enforcing itโฆ. We are persuaded that the 80-cent clause is an implied union signatory clause, and not a union standards clause as found by 
our colleagues. Clearly, as the Mid-Continent example demonstrates, signatories are required to make the 80-cent payment on 
coal purchases from nonsignatories even though the wage and fringe benefit standards of the nonsignatory may be comparable 
to or even better than those established in the UMW contract, while no such payment is imposed on coal purchased from 
signatoriesโฆ. Accordingly, even though we accept the Trial Examiner's findings that the parties adopted the clause in order to 
equalize the wage and fringe benefit costs of signatories and nonsignatories, we must find that the parties have failed to embody 
their purpose in language that operates in a lawful (sic) manner. Id. at 755 (footnotes omitted). It is plain, then, that a ""hot cargo"" clause is lawful only under the most refined of conditions, and then only marginally. As there is 
no evidence in the instant case that the purchase-of-coal clause was intended by the parties to the Agreement as a means of 
standardizing wages and working conditions among union and nonunion employees or even that there was in fact a differential 
in the treatment of those two groups of workers, the clause can only be viewed as imposing a penalty on purchases of coal from 
nonunion producers. Any other conclusion rests only on speculation which ill becomes this court."

304,3," In other words, long-run demand for copper is elastic."
304,4," The 1960's was a period of worldwide shortages in copper supply, because of the combined effects of labor and political 
problems in copper producing countries and sharply surging demand for copper, primarily caused by the heavy defense 
requirements in Vietnam.  See generally Y. Levy, Copper: Red Metal in Flux 22 (1968) (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
Monthly Review Supplement). "
305,5," This claim was presumably dropped for lack of any facts to indicate that Reading, as a seller of refined copper, was prevented 
from making sales due to defendants' alleged maintenance of low prices. In fact, as a seller of refined copper, Reading appears 
to have benefited from the price rise, which it attributes to defendants' conduct."
305,6," The standard for review is that of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) for summary judgments; Reading is to be given the benefit of all 
reasonable doubts in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists.  Heyman v. Commerce & Indus. Ins. Co., 524

] While summary proceedings in antitrust litigation are disfavored, Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 491, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962), they are not to be read out of the antitrust

In Poller, the crucial issue was one of motive and intent, which is a question particularly unsuited for judgment on affidavits, but 
no such issue of motivation is presented in this case.  Where the claim turns on documentary evidence and not intent, summary 
judgment is appropriate.  White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 259, 83 S. Ct. 696, 699, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963); see

issue of law, party cannot rest on allegations in complaint to oppose properly supported motion for summary judgment against 
him). "
306,7," Reading's economic reasoning is as attenuated as its theory of causality. For example, to argue that scrap prices rose 
because competing fabricators would pay more due to savings at the lower producers' price ignores the fundamental economic 
fact that optimal profit-maximizing decisions depend upon marginal cost per unit and not average cost.  See W. Baumol,

332,12," Subsection (b) provides in pertinent part as follows: (b) The Federal Power Commission shall include among the licensing conditions, in addition to those deemed necessary and 
required under the terms of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. ยง 791a et seq.), the following: (1) In order to assure that at least 50 per centum of the project power shall be available for sale and distribution primarily for the 
benefit of the people as consumers, particularly domestic and rural consumers, to whom such power shall be made available at 
the lowest rates reasonably possible and in such manner as to encourage the widest possible use, the licensee in disposing of 
50 per centum of the project power shall give preference and priority to public bodies and nonprofit cooperatives within economic 
transmission distance. In any case in which project power subject to the preference provisions of this paragraph is sold to utility 
companies organized and administered for profit, the licensee shall make flexible arrangements and contracts providing for the 
withdrawal upon reasonable notice and fair terms of enough power to meet the reasonably foreseeable needs of the preference 
customers. (2) The licensee shall make a reasonable portion of the project power subject to the preference provisions of paragraph (1) of 
this subsection available for use within reasonable economic transmission distance in neighboring States, but this paragraph 
shall not be construed to require more than 20 per centum of the project power subject to such preference provisions to be made 
available for use in such States. The licensee shall cooperate with the appropriate agencies in such States to insure compliance 
with this requirement. In the event of disagreement between the licensee and the power-marketing agencies of any of such 
States, the Federal Power Commission may, after public hearings, determine and fix the applicable portion of power to be made 
available and the terms applicable thereto: Provided, That if any such State shall have designated a bargaining agency for the 
procurement of such power on behalf of such State, the licensee shall deal only with such agency in that State. The 
arrangements made by the licensee for the sale of power to or in such State shall include observance of the preferences in 
paragraph (1) of this subsection. The 50% provision in (b)(1) was described as ""a satisfactory compromise"" between ""the Federal preference policy which 
accords priorities in power marketing to public distribution systems and nonprofit cooperatives"" and the state's view that ""such 
preference requirements would adversely affect (PASNY's) ability to sell revenue bonds to finance the construction of the 
Niagara project."" H.R.Rep.No. 862, supra, (1957) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 1593. "
333,13," The provisions of the New York Power Authority Act, invoked by NYSEG, have no bearing on the Commission's jurisdiction in 
this case. While those provisions spell out PASNY's responsibilities under state law, see N.Y.Pub.Auth. Law ยง 1005 (McKinney), 
they do not, and indeed could not, limit the jurisdiction of the federal agency responsible for enforcing and administering the 
FPA. In the absence of persuasive proof, and NYSEG offers none, we cannot assume that Congress intended to replace the 
Commission's assessment of public interest, including its consideration of federal antitrust policies, with PASNY's assessment of 
public interest, made pursuant to its authority under New York state law."
333,14," We cannot say that New York's regulation of utilities, pervasive though it may be, is sufficient to immunize regulated utilities 
from antitrust liability. In Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, the Court observed that state action immunity might reasonably be 
extended to private conduct where ""a private citizen has done nothing more than obey the command of his state sovereign, 
(and) it would be unjust to conclude that he has thereby offended federal law,"" or where ""the State is already regulating an area 
of the economy, (and) it is arguable that Congress did not intend to superimpose the antitrust laws as an additional, and perhaps 
conflicting, regulatory mechanism."" 428 U.S. at 592, 96 S. Ct. at 3118. Nevertheless, the opinion noted that ""(t)he Court has "
334,," already decided that HN13[
] ""state authorization, approval, encouragement, or participation in restrictive private conduct 
confers no antitrust immunity,' "" id. at 592-93, 96 S. Ct. at 3118 (footnotes omitted), and pointed out that ""(t)here is no logical 
inconsistency between requiring (a public utility) to meet regulatory criteria insofar as it is exercising its natural monopoly powers 
and also to comply with antitrust standards to the extent that it engages in business activity in competitive areas of the 
economy."" Id. at 596, 96 S. Ct. at 3120. Cf.  Gulf States Utilities Co. v. FPC, supra, 411 U.S. at 758-59, 93 S. Ct. at 1877-78; 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, supra."
334,15," Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co. involved an antitrust suit brought by several Louisiana cities against an investor-
owned utility (LP&L). LP&L counterclaimed, alleging various antitrust violations, including an illegal tying arrangement whereby 
one city contracted to provide gas and water service to LP&L electric customers outside city limits only on condition that the 
customers purchase electricity from the city rather than from LP&L. The municipalities moved for dismissal of the counterclaim 
on the ground that they were immune from antitrust liability. A majority of the Court held that in some circumstances, a 
municipality might be immune from liability as an agent of the state, but that no congressional intent to exempt local 
governments from federal antitrust laws could be inferred. Justice Brennan's analysis of the potential impact of eliminating 
customers from an established service area appears in Part I of his opinion, in which, joined by four other Justices, he concluded 
that practices designed to maximize benefits for the municipal constituencies may have an adverse impact upon the investor-
owned utility and its customers and, accordingly, do not necessarily serve the national public interest. "
336,16," The Act's reliance on voluntary commercial relationships was one factor that persuaded the Supreme Court that industries 
regulated under the FPA were not immunized from antitrust liability and that federal courts, to remedy antitrust violations, could 
order a utility to wheel power. Id."
336,17," Although these provisions became effective after Penn Yan's petition was filed, there does not seem to be any dispute that 
the Commission could use its new powers in deciding that petition. "

invested capital. See FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., supra, 350 U.S. at 355, 76 S. Ct. at 372."
337,19," Section 212(c)(1) provides, in part: HN19[
] Before issuing an order under โฆ subsection (a) or (b) of section 824j of this title, the Commission shall issue a proposed order and set a reasonable time for parties to the proposed โฆ transmission order to agree to terms and conditions 
under which such order is to be carried out, including the apportionment of costs between them and the compensation or 
reimbursement reasonably due to any of them. "

applicable legal discussion.  It is reported at 478 F. Supp. 1268 (D.N.J.1979). "
344,2," .  Although the plaintiff also asked for injunctive relief in its complaint, the district court did not discuss that aspect of the case in 
its findings and opinion.  On appeal, the plaintiff has not raised the issue, and we therefore assume that it is no longer in the 
case.  In any event, although injunctive relief may be appropriate where damages are not, in the circumstances present here, the 
failure to prove the fact of injury is conclusive as to both forms of relief.  See Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 187 U.S. 
App. D.C. 11, 569 F.2d 666, 668 n.2, 670 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1977). "

350,2," I am not persuaded by the current record that this $ 500,000.00 was in fact invested by Unit in improvements to the Farmers 
Bank Building for the benefit of Freidco-Wilmington. "
353,3, Section 1972 imposes per se liability on bank holding companies in additional situations.
353,4," The Senate Report, for example explains: Because of their inherent anti-competitive effects, which may operate to the detriment of bank customers as well as 
banking and nonbanking competitors, tying arrangements involving a bank are made unlawful by this section without any "
354,," showing of specific adverse effects on competition or other restraints of trade and without any showing of some degree of 
bank dominance or control over the tying product or service. Sen.Rep. No. 91-1084, 91st Cong., 1st Sess."
354,5," While there is at least one reference in the legislative history to ""reciprocity"", subsection (C) is not aimed at what have 
traditionally been referred to in the antitrust law as reciprocity arrangements.  See Bass v. Boston Five Cent Sav. Bank, 478 F. 
Supp. 741, 748 (D.Mass.1979); United States v. Penick and Ford Ltd., 242 F. Supp. 518 (D.N.J.1965)."
354,6," Plaintiffs make two related arguments which do not require separate analysis.  Unit argues that Unit was required to provide a 
service in the form of an ""automatic charge"" on the Freidco account.  This unduly strains the concept of a ""service"" as used in 
the Act.  Finally, it is suggested that the application of the withdrawals to the overdue sublease payments in July of 1975 was a 
requirement that Unit supply property as a condition of an extension of credit. My analysis and conclusion with respect to the 
application of the $ 10,000 withdrawal prior to July of 1975 is equally appropriate here."
354,7," See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 891(1); 15 U.S.C. ยง 1691a(d); Gilbert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 448 F. Supp. 440, 443 & n. 1 
(D.Conn.1978). "
355,8," This reading conforms to the economic realities of the situation.  Farmers had no concern about Hickman and Company's 
keeping the Farmers Bank Building account.  Hickman and Tingle were committed to provide management services to Freidco-
Wilmington without further charge and there was no reason to believe that they would wish to satisfy this obligation by retaining 
anyone other than Hickman's own firm, who had handled the operation since its inception."
355,9," What would be proper practice is not altogether clear from Mr. Dix's testimony.  He testified as follows on direct: If Unit owed Farmers Bank about $ 450,000.00 and the loan was overdue and if Farmers knew that the funds of Freidco 
which were deposited in the bank could be drawn on only by Unit, but that Unit owned less than all of its Freidco 
partnership, specifically 80% or less; and that $ 10,000.00 a month was more than Unit's share or likely to be more than 
Unit's share of the monthly income from the partnership, would it be ordinary and proper bank practice to require under 
threat of foreclosure of Unit's property, that Unit sign documents authorizing the withdrawal of $ 10,000.00 a month from the 
Freidco account? Q Do you have an opinion? A It's standard practice to seek the acknowledgment of all parties to that entity if in fact that you're asking for funds from a 
source other than the borrowing entity and have those acknowledgments as a matter of record. Q You're under the hypothetical-I got-I gave you-assuming only that the general partner's agreement was requested, you're 
saying it would not be proper practice? A I think it's very important for the bank to make sure that all parties to that, the funding entity in this case, the one with the 
money and making the monthly charges were aware and acknowledge the fact that this transaction was going to occur. (Dix. pp. 24-25).  Subsequent testimony suggests, however, that a signature of a general partner qua general partner, would 
suffice unless there was ""cause to believe"" that the payments would appropriate a limited partner's interest.  Here Farmers had 
such cause, although the record does not indicate it had reason to believe that Hickman and Tingle had not consented. "
356,10," Nor do I express any opinion on whether any liability could be predicated on Farmers' threat to foreclose upon the pledge of 
rents when it knew the obligation which the pledge was given to secure had been fully satisfied. "

376,1," PRINCIPLES OF MEDICAL ETHICS PREAMBLE These principles are intended to aid physicians individually and collectively in maintaining a high level of ethical conduct.  They 
are not laws but standards by which a physician may determine the propriety of his conduct in his relationship with patients, with 
colleagues, with members of allied professions, and with the public. SECTION 1 The principle objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect for the dignity of man.  
Physicians should merit the confidence of patients entrusted to their care, rendering to each a full measure of service and 
devotion. SECTION 2 Physicians should strive continually to improve medical knowledge and skill, and should make available to their patients and 
colleagues the benefits of their professional attainments. SECTION 3 A physician should practice a method of healing founded on a scientific basis; and he should not voluntarily associate 
professionally with anyone who violates this principle. SECTION 4 "
377,," The medical profession should safeguard the public and itself against physicians deficient in moral character or professional 
competence.  Physicians should observe all laws, uphold the dignity and honor of the profession and accept its self-imposed 
disciplines.  They should expose, without hesitation, illegal or unethical conduct of fellow members of the profession. SECTION 5 A physician may choose whom he will serve.  In an emergency, however, he should render service to the best of his ability.  
Having undertaken the care of a patient, he may not neglect him; and unless he has been discharged he may discontinue his 
services only after giving adequate notice.  He should not solicit patients. SECTION 6 A physician should not dispose of his services under terms or conditions which tend to interfere with or impair the free and 
complete exercise of his medical judgment and skill or tend to cause a deterioration of the quality of medical care. SECTION 7 In the practice of medicine a physician should limit the source of his professional income to medical services actually rendered 
by him, or under his supervision, to his patients. His fee should be commensurate with the services rendered and the patient's 
ability to pay.  He should neither pay nor receive a commission for referral of patients. Drugs, remedies or appliances may be 
dispensed or supplied by the physician provided it is in the best interests of the patient. SECTION 8 A physician should seek consultation upon request; in doubtful or difficult cases; or whenever it appears that the quality of 
medical service may be enhanced thereby. SECTION 9 A physician may not reveal the confidences entrusted to him in the course of medical attendance, or the deficiencies he may 
observe in the character of patients, unless he is required to do so by law or unless it becomes necessary in order to protect the 
welfare of the individual or of the community. SECTION 10 The honored ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individual, but 
also to society where these responsibilities deserve his interest and participation in activities which have the purpose of 
improving both the health and the well-being of the individual and the community. "
378,2," The Order herein does not require, at least directly, that CSMS or NHCMA petitioners cease and desist from doing anything.  
However, both petitioners contend that they are proper parties to this proceeding since they were named as respondents in the 
agency action below, adverse findings were made against them by the FTC, and they are affected by the Final Order.  The FTC 
does not oppose their participation in this proceeding, and suggests that they may be treated as intervenors.  At the same time, 
CSMS and NHCMA do not appear to be seeking relief independent from that sought by AMA.  In view of these factors, we 
assume without deciding that CSMS and NHCMA are proper parties to this petition for review."
378,3, There appears to be no dispute that the practices complained of affect interstate commerce.

petitioners, since in both of those cases a commissioner made statements as to specific facts yet to be resolved in the 
respective proceedings.  Indeed, the Texaco court specifically noted that since it could ""not expect a Trade Commissioner to be 
neutral on anti-monopoly policies,"" such an adjudicator could be permitted to hear a case, even ""after he had expressed an

] ""it is not improper for members of regulatory commissions to form views about law and policy on the 
basis of their prior adjudications of similar issues which may influence them in deciding later cases."" Rombough v. FAA, 594 
F.2d 893, 900 (2d Cir. 1979)."
379,5," Sixteen months after the complaint was filed, AMA revised its Opinions and Reports.  Petitioners contend that any violations 
that may have existed earlier were corrected by the 1977 version.  We do not believe the FTC was required to amend its 
complaint at that point.  However, AMA's post-complaint revision properly may be considered on the issue of the remedy 
provided in the Final Order.  See United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 47, 80 S. Ct. 503, 513, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505 
(1960); United States v. Oregon Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 332, 72 S. Ct. 690, 695, 96 L. Ed. 978 (1952). "
381,6," For example, the ban on ""solicitation"" in the ""Principles of Medical Ethics"" was left unchanged, and the definition of that term 
incorporates many of the catchwords of earlier restraints.  One instance of this is the retained condemnation of ""self-laudatory"" 
advertisements, even if fully accurate.  In addition, the list of ""accepted local media"" fails to include newspapers, radio, or 
television.  Publication of fees is mentioned only in connection with ""reputable directories."""
381,7," The record is mixed with regard to the impression of the average physician regarding the effect of the 1977 edition of Opinions 
and Reports on earlier versions.  One witness testified that it was well accepted in the medical community that publication of a 
new edition rescinds previous editions. Other evidence, however, indicated that pre-1977 standards are still viewed as binding 
by physicians."
381,8," In view of our finding of other substantial evidence to support the remedial order, we need not address the question whether 
the administrative law judge properly rendered an adverse finding against AMA for failure to comply with a subpoena duces 
tecum."
381,9," AMA in its reply brief urges comparison with the FTC's actions regarding veterinary organizations, in which the agency 
withdrew proposed rules concerning veterinary advertising as a result of voluntary reforms on the part of those organizations.  
Federal Trade Commission, News Summary (April 11, 1980).  However, we feel that this example cogently illustrates the limits 
of our review in cases of this nature: It is up to the FTC to take recognition of genuine, voluntary reform by withdrawing formal 
proceedings when within its discretion it sees fit to do so. "
382,10," The relevant provisions of the Order require AMA to cease and desist from: A. Restricting, regulating, impeding, advising on the ethical propriety of, or interfering with the consideration offered or provided 
to any physician in return for the sale, purchase or distribution of his or her professional services; B. Restricting, interfering with, or impeding the growth, development or operations of any entity that offers physicians' services to 
the public, by means of any statement or other representation concerning the ethical propriety of medical service arrangements 
that limit the patient's choice of a physician;C. Restricting, interfering with, or impeding the growth, development or operations of 
any entity that offers physicians' services to the public, by means of any statement or other representation concerning the ethical 
propriety of participation by non-physicians in the ownership or management of said organization; and D. Inducing, urging, encouraging, or assisting any physician, or any medical association, group of physicians, hospital, insurance 
carrier or any other non-governmental organization to take any of the actions prohibited by this Part. "
383,11," In addition, we refer petitioners to the opinion of the FTC herein, in which they are provided certain guidelines, to wit, where 
ads merely state the price of routine and standardized services, there is little need for further ethical restrictions to prevent 
deception; where restrictions are justified, they should be reasonably related to goal of preventing deception; and across-the-
board bans to broad categories of representations, or general restrictions applicable to any representation made through a 
specific medium, are highly suspect.  FTC Opinion, at 59."
383,12," AMA cannot claim, as it attempts to do, that the disaffiliation provisions of the Order contravene Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d), since that 
rule is inapplicable to agency orders.  Moreover, there are no specific contempt proceedings that AMA's constituent societies 
need be protected from since they are not bound by any FTC order.  See Vuitton et Fils S.A. v. Carousel Handbags, 592 F.2d 
126 (2d Cir. 1979). "
384,1," Under ยง 5(a)(2) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 45(a)(2), provides in pertinent part: ""The Commission is empowered and directed to prevent โฆ corporations โฆ from using unfair methods of competition in or 
affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."" Section 4 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 44, defines ""corporation"" as: ""any company, trust, so-called Massachusetts trust, or association, incorporated or unincorporated, which is organized to carry 
on business for its own profit or that of its members."""
384,2," The decisions cited by the majority do not support the proposition that a non-profit association's engagement in any business 
activity secondary to its charitable and social work confers jurisdiction on the FTC.  Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 
95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), arose under the Sherman Act, which has no jurisdictional limitations as does the FTC 
Act. The Sherman Act, unlike the FTC Act, contains no provision excluding non-profit organizations from its coverage.  In FTC v. 
Ernstthal, 197 U.S. App. D.C. 174, 607 F.2d 488 (D.C.Cir.1979), the FTC had commenced an investigation.  When its 
jurisdiction was challenged, the court merely held that since the question of whether there was jurisdiction turned on the 
activities of the organization, which could only be ascertained in the investigation, it was too early for the court to rule one way or 
the other on the jurisdictional issue. "
385,3," The Administrative Law Judge's decision states (at p. 227): ""The proposal for a new ""updated' edition of the 1971 Opinions and Reports was formally sanctioned at a meeting of the Judicial 
Council in November 1975 (Tr. 4336; RX 621)."" "
386,4," The new Principles of Medical Ethics adopted by the Association on July 22, 1980, provide: ""PREAMBLE ""The medical profession has long subscribed to a body of ethical statements developed primarily for the benefit of the patient. As 
a member of this profession, a physician must recognize responsibility not only to patients, but also to society, to other health 
professionals, and to self.  The following Principles adopted by the American Medical Association are not laws, but standards of 
conduct which define the essentials of honorable behavior for the physician. (I.) ""A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical service with compassion and respect for human dignity. (II.) ""A physician shall deal honestly with patients and colleagues, and strive to expose those physicians deficient in character or 
competence, or who engage in fraud or deception. "
387,," (III.) ""A physician shall respect the law and also recognize a responsibility to seek changes in those requirements which are contrary 
to the best interests of the patient. (IV.) ""A physician shall respect the rights of patients, of colleagues, and of other health professionals, and shall safeguard patient 
confidences within the constraints of the law. (V.) ""A physician shall continue to study, apply and advance scientific knowledge, make relevant information available to patients, 
colleagues, and the public, obtain consultation, and use the talents of other health professionals when indicated. (VI.) ""A physician shall, in the provision of appropriate patient care, except in emergencies, be free to choose whom to serve, with 
whom to associate, and the environment in which to provide medical services. (VII.) ""A physician shall recognize a responsibility to participate in activities contributing to an improved community."" "
395,1," The formulation of this ""grave or serious question"" test was first put forth by Judge Jerome Frank in Hamilton Watch Co. v. 
Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1953). "

404,1," The 18-month limitation was first enacted as an amendment to 28 U.S.C. ยง 421, Act of Apr. 17, 1940.  54 Stat. 101.  Rule 6(g) 
is the successor to 28 U.S.C. ยง 421. "
406,2," HN7[
]  15 U.S.C. ยง 1 (1976) provides in relevant part: Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one million dollars if a 
corporation, or, if any other person, one hundred thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said 
punishments, in the discretion of the court."
406,3," We leave open the question whether infamous punishments might be fashioned in the future that could be inflicted upon 
corporations. "
407,4," The Pandilidis court found no showing of prejudice to the defendant where amendment of a grand jury indictment was 
permitted without submission of that amendment to the grand jury as required under Rule 7(e), Fed.R.Crim.P. 524 F.2d at 649. 
Contra, United States v. Goldstein, 502 F.2d 526 (3d Cir. 1974) (even in misdemeanor cases, in which indictments are not 
constitutionally required, any amendment to an indictment without grand jury action results in automatic prejudice to defendant). "
409,*," The complaint alleged that this Court's jurisdiction was invoked under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. That, however, is not a 
jurisdictional statute; 28 U.S.C. ยง 1337 vests the federal district courts with jurisdiction over claims arising under the Sherman 
Act. See Parker v. Brown (1943), 317 U.S. 341, 349, 63 S. Ct. 307, 312, 87 L. Ed. 315, 325 (headnote 1). "
414,1," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) provides, in pertinent part: HN1[
] (f) When Affidavits are Unavailable.  Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot 
for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment 
or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make 
such other order as is just. See also, Harris v. Pate, 440 F.2d 315 (7th Cir. 1971)."
414,2," Gold Seal describes Perrier Water as follows: Perrier Waterโฆ is naturally carbonated mineral water which originates below the surface of the earth, in southern France in the 
vicinity of Vergeze, France.  The gases which produce the unique natural carbonation were created by volcanic eruptions which 
occurred during the Cretaceous Era, more than 140 million years ago.  These gases rise through porous limestone and cracked 
marls to contribute natural carbonation to the water which comes from the Perrier Spring.  No chemicals, preservatives, 
flavorings or additives are included. "
424,1," Dresser Industries, Inc., a diversified corporate conglomerate, acquired the General Abrasives Division (Canadian and United 
States) of U.S. Industries, Inc., similarly a diversified corporate conglomerate, in 1977.  Accordingly, Dresser was added as a 
party plaintiff pursuant to Rule 25(c), Fed.R.Civ., Pro. See U.S. Industries, Inc. v. Norton Company, 71- CV-359, 202 USPQ 229 
(N.D.N.Y., Feb. 15, 1978).  Transcript, pp. 631-649; Exhibit 42. "
427,2," In the Massachusetts litigation, and in this Court, Norton successfully moved to add Dr. Newman W. Thibault as a co-inventor 
of the '939 patent, pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  ยง 256. Norton Company v. Carborundum Company, 397 F.Supp. 639, 648, 186 
USPQ 189, 196 (D. Mass. 1975); U.S. Industries v. Norton Company, 71- CV-359, 184 USPQ 187 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 1974). "
431,4," General Abrasives manufactures abrasive grains, and, is a division of Dresser Industries, Inc.; and, formerly a division of U.S. 
Industries, Inc."
431,5," Concomitant to the development of ZM Lionite was Dr. Ueltz's efforts to secure a process patent for the rapid cooling method 
employed in its manufacture, an effort subsequently abandoned (Tr. 165-176, 211-214, Exs. 11, 22, 23. Dr. Ueltz did not 
perceive any novelty in the product as distinguished from the process.  (Tr. 176-177, 182). "
432,6," The Court of Appeals did not reach the question of Norton's misconduct; instead, it permised its affirmance upon the lower 
court's determination of validity, as narrowly construed.  Norton Co. v. Carborundum Co., supra, 530 F.2d at 441-42, 189 USPQ 
1, 5-7. "
433,7," The standard of materiality is apparently different for fraud as distinguished from inequitable conduct.  Materiality in a fraud 
context calls for a determination that the claims would not have been allowed but for the misconduct. Materiality in the 
inequitable conduct context calls for a determination of whether such conduct (usually omission and/or misrepresentation) made 
it impossible for the Patent Office to assess the patent application against the prevailing statutory criteria.  Compare Norton v. 
Curtiss, supra with E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co. v. Berkley & Co., Inc., supra. See SCM Corporation of America v. Radio 
Corporation, supra at 448-49, 167 USPA at 206-208. "
434,8," Defendant has placed considerable reliance upon the fact that prior to March 1, 1979, there was no express obligation by rule 
to disclose material information to the Patent Office.  See infra.  The new rule, 37 C.F.R.ยง 1.56 (1977), expressly requires the 
disclosure of information ""which is material to the examination of the application."" We agree with the holding of the Tenth Circuit 
Court of Appeals in True Temper Corp. v. CF & I Steel Corp., supra, 202 USPQ at 419, n.9; that is, Rule 56 is merely a 
codification of existing case law on the obligation to disclose pertinent prior art or other material information.  Therefore, the 
practice which was extant in patent prosecutions before the Patent Office prior to 1977 is not dispositive as to Norton's duty of 
candor during its prosecution of the patent in suit."
434,9," The parties were able to depose Examiner Arnold on May 11, 1978.  Plaintiffs' lead counsel was wholly unsuccessful in 
deriving any information of probative value from Arnold, inasmuch as an Associate Solicitor from the Patent and Trademark 
Office severly circumscribed the area of inquiry pursuant to the guidelines formulated from Shaffer Tool Works v. Joy 
Manufacturing, Co., 167 USPQ 170 (S.D. Tex. 1970). Under these guidelines, patent examiners may not be deposed on matters 
relating to their mental processes, analysis, and conclusions upon applications maturing into the patent in suit.  This 
preternatural solicitousness effectively eliminates any subjective inquiries. "
435,10," There is no evidence before the Court that Norton's patent attorney was aware of '709 patent at the time of the prosecution of 
the '939 patent. That fact, however, does not diminish the misrepresentation that the soda levels in the '490 product was 
theoretically attributed to the commercially available Bayer process alumina of 1917-1918. "
436,11," Norton has continuously and vigorously sought to introduce evidence that the '491 patent was brought to the attention of 
Examiner Arnold during Interference proceedings with Cutt, a Carborundum employee.(Tr. 1243-1260; Exs. AY, AZ, BA, BB).  
Norton's argument is that if the Examiner Arnold, who also handled the Interference, had felt that he had been deceived, he 
could have withdrawn his allowance of the '939 patent. Additionally, Norton argues that the Interference proceedings convinced 
them that their product did include a bauxite mix, thus permitting them to claim infringement by competitive alumina-zirconia 
grains. Judge Aldrich held that Norton's arguments were unpersuasive; and, that in any event, Norton should not be rescused by 
""subsequent collateral events and inferences that I find, at best, speculative."" 397 F.Supp. at 644, 186 USPQ at 193. This Court 
agrees.  My primary concern is with Norton's conduct leading to the issuance of the '939 patent; and, not with subsequent 
events, particularly with another party (Carborundum) whose own conduct was far from reproach. Moreover, it is again appropriate to comment upon the Massachusetts decisions.  In the Court of Appeals, it was noted that the 
failure to cite the '491 was not disabling to the '939 patent as narrowly defined.  530 F.2d at 441, 189 USPQ at 5-6. That Court 
further stated that even as narrowly construed, the failure to cite '491 ""could have a disabling effect only if it were to be 
considered inequitable behavior of such magnitude that the '939 patent should be declared unenforceable."" 530 F.2d at 441-42, 
n.17, 189 USPQ at 5-7, n.17. In my judgment that magnitude of inequitable behavior is evidenced here.  See infra. "
442,12," Much of the testimony in this area was sealed and submitted as ""Business Confidential"".  (Tr. 1114-1140, 1294-1308; Ex. 52); 
consequently, apart from volumes and percentages freely disclosed, this Court will refrain from disclosing confidential figures "
443,," derived from sealed testimony and exhibits.  Such testimony and exhibits will be resealed for filing with the Clerk -- only to be 
opened by court order when necessary."
443,13," HN25[
] Market definition (and market share) is a critical determinant in the absence of other probative facts establishing the 
presence and degree of market power.  In the matter before the Court, there was little evidence presented on the degree of 
Norton's market power; that is, Norton's capacity to sell its alumina-zirconia abrasives at various prices, the cost of producing 
those abrasives at various prices and the existence of excess profits.  (Tr. 556-561, 874, 884-885, 960-975, 1035-1040; Ex. 37).  
Nevertheless, it is clear that market power may ordinarily be inferred from a predominant share.  United States vs. Grinnell 
Corp., supra at 571."
443,14, these amounts were taken from the last full year's sales figures before trial.
443,15," These figures were derived from industry publications and Norton's own sales.  In subsequent market segments, the sales are 
premised upon wheel value.  (Tr. 867-873). "
456,1," Dresser Industries, Inc., a diversified corporate conglomerate, acquired the General Abrasives Division (Canadian and United 
States) of U.S. Industries, Inc., similarly a diversified conglomerate, in 1977.  Accordingly, Dresser was added as a party plaintiff 
pursuant to Rule 25(c), Fed. R. Civ. Pro. See U.S. Industries, Inc. v. Norton Company, 71-CV-359 (N.D.N.Y., Feb. 15, 1978).

461,3," Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court, notably Anderson's Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U.S. 57 
(1969) and Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., 425 U.S. 273 (1976), have aroused considerable agitation amongst patent experts as to 
their impact upon Graham and ยง 103. See generally, Nonobviousness -- The Ultimate Condition of Patentability (J. F. 
Witherspoon, ed. 1980).  In my judgment, the three-prong test of the trilogy is most suitable for giving effect to the congressional 
mandates embodied in ยง 103 See Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Gyromat Corp., 603 F.2d 361, 372 (2d Cir. 1979). "

found within the forum state may be made ""under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed"" in the forum's state's 
statutes or rules. The Court further recognizes that the venue provisions of ยง 12 of the Clayton Act supplement the general federal venue 
provisions and does not preempt them.  United States Dental Institute v. American Association of Orthodontists, 396 F. Supp. 
565, 573 (N.D.Ill.1975). Defendant AMA's assertion that jurisdiction and venue over it is improper under the Iowa long-arm statute and the general 
federal venue statute need not be considered since it is properly before this Court under ยง 12 of the Clayton Act. "
510,13," .  HN15[

100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980), held that an Eastern auto dealer and wholesaler would not be subject to jurisdiction in a 
products liability case initiated in the place of injury, Oklahoma. The Supreme Court indicated that the only ""affiliating 
circumstance"" with the forum was the fortuitous injury there, and concluded on the basis of this fortuitous contact and the lack of 
foreseeability that defendants had no ""contacts, ties or relations"" with Oklahoma so as to satisfy International Shoe Co. v. 
Washington.  Id. 100 S. Ct. at 568. This Court does not believe that this recent decision in any way alters the prior law applicable 
to the present jurisdictional controversy, and is confident that the Eighth Circuit's distillation of such prior cases into a five factor

518,20," .  Under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, the Court has already dismissed Count I of the complaint as to defendants 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield to the extent it is alleged they boycotted or refused to deal with assignor members of HCEC. As a 
result, the Court does not believe that it need consider if defendants are also exempt from the boycott charge under the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 98 S. Ct. 2923, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932 (1978)."
518,21," .  These agreements were described by the court: Blue Shield offers insurance policies which entitle the policyholders to obtain prescription drugs. If the pharmacy selected by the 
insured has entered into a ""Pharmacy Agreement"" with Blue Shield, and is therefore a participating pharmacy, the insured is 
required to pay only $ 2 for every prescription drug. The remainder of the cost is paid directly by Blue Shield to the participating 
pharmacy. If, on the other hand, the insured selects a pharmacy which has not entered into a Pharmacy Agreement, and is 
therefore a non-participating pharmacy, he is required to pay the full price charged by the pharmacy. The insured may then 
obtain reimbursement from Blue Shield for 75% of the difference between that price and $ 2. Blue Shield offered to enter into a Pharmacy Agreement with each licensed pharmacy in Texas. Under the Agreement, a 
participating pharmacy agrees to furnish prescription drugs to Blue Shield's policyholders at $ 2 for each prescription, and Blue 
Shield agrees to reimburse the pharmacy for the pharmacy's cost of acquiring the amount of the drug prescribed. Thus, only 
pharmacies that can afford to distribute prescription drugs for less than this $ 2 markup can profitably participate in the plan. "

525,1," Chock Full of Power alleges that it purchased the property at the southeast corner of Linden Boulevard and Elmont Road from 
Linmont ""in or about 1971."" At that time, Linmont was in default in payment to Amoco for merchandise; Amoco held two 
mortgages on the property in the principal amount of approximately $ 335,977.61; and in order to obtain an extension of the 
maturity date of the mortgages Amoco demanded that the extension agreement incorporate an Exclusive Requirements 
Agreement requiring that all accessories be purchased from Amoco. Chock Full of Power then leased the premises to a tenant 
who operated the service station. tThe gravamen of the claim is that (1) Amoco had refused to deliver any product to the station 
unless plaintiff and its tenant agreed to recognize the Exclusive Requirements Agreement asserted by the other defendants, 
Newman, Nager and Wolf, and (2) Amoco refused to make delivery to anyone other than to Linmont Properties, Inc. and its 
wholly-owned operator-dealer Brothers Service Station of Elmont, Inc. (par. 15). "
526,2," Fetner operated three other gasoline service stations which also used Amoco products.  For the year 1964 a station on Grand 
Avenue in Brooklyn purchased 968,179 gallons and a station on Hempstead Turnpike, Elmont purchased 1,072,561 gallons. A 
station in Hicksville which opened December 1964 was expected to purchase 1,800,000 gallons for the year 1965.(Exh. 9)."
526,3, Fetner and one Isidore Usiskin owned all the stock of Linmont in equal shares. 
527,4," The execution of the contract of sale and the conveyance of title to the premises pursuant to the contract were simultaneously 
performed on February 10, 1965."
527,5," On May 14, 1965 Linmont conveyed Parcel A to the County of Nassau in exchange for Parcel C.  The County of Nassau gave 
Linmont an easement for ingress and egress over Parcel A and from Elmont Road until the proposed widening of Elmont Road 
was accomplished."
527,6, The agreement was recorded as a restrictive covenant affecting Parcels A and B.
527,7, Amoco paid Newtal 2 cents per gallon.
527,8," Newtal's distributorship agreement expired on April 30, 1969."
527,9," N.N. & W. executed a subordination agreement on February 10, 1965. "
528,10, Apparently Linmont operated under a temporary certificate of occupancy beginning in September 1965. 
529,11," The noteprovided that if Fetner or any of the corporations operating his service stations should discontinue purchasing Amoco 
gasoline for more than thirty (30) days, then, at Amoco's option, the balance due immediately would become due and payable."
529,12," The letter also advised Amoco that the offer was part of a package deal in which Fetner's Country Road station at Hicksville 
was to be sold for $ 250,000 -- a total of $ 700,000 for both stations."
529,13," At the same time Wisser signed a contract of sale purchasing Fetner's County Road station in Hicksville for $200,000. "
530,14," The court rejects any theory of recovery based on breach of contract, fraud or deceit.  These theories are based on alleged 
oral representations or agreements that Newman, Wolf or Trainor (Amoco District Manager) induced Fetner to purchase Parcel 
A; that the Elmont Station would always be competitive; that the Elmont Station would work on 4.0 to 4.5 cents margin.  
However, Fetner's testimony which was offered in support of these claims was not credible.  Moreover, it is also clear that such 
claims are time barred."
530,15," The agreement was filed as a restrictive covenant on Parcels A and B.  Linmont agreed not to permit anyone to sell gasolineor 
any petroleum products ""other than those supplied by [N.N. & W.] its successors, assignees or designees."" N.N. & W. 
irrevocably designated ""the gasoline, oil and petroleum products of the American Oil Company and Newtal Corp. as the 
American Oil Company distributor."" The term of the agreement was for ten (10) years.  The modification of the agreement and 
subsequent dissolution of Newtal Corp. is irrelevant to the discussion."
530,16," Section 1 states in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegalโฆ."" Section 2 provides: "
531,," ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be guilty of a felonyโฆ."""
531,17," It is significant that the agreement between N.N. & W. and Linmont dated February 10, 1965 provided that N.N. & W. 
""irrevocably [designate] the gasoline, oil and petroleum products of the American Oil Companyโฆ."" The designation was obviously intended to assure the supply of Amoco gasoline and petroleum products and deny N.N. & W. 
the right to designate a competitive product."
531,18," In Tampa Electric Co., the Court formulated guidelines for the determination of whether a contract will foreclose competition in 
a substantial share of the lineof commerce affected.  When engaging in such an inquiry, a court must: (1) determine the line of 
commerce; (2) charter the area of effective competition in that line of commerce by careful selection of the market area in which 
the seller operates; and (3) determine the extent to which competitors are foreclosed from entering or remaining. Plaintiffs claim that the area of effective competition is a radius of approximately two miles from the Elmont Station. That area 
has eight additional Amoco service stations and approximately 47 additional service stations selling national brands of gasoline 
and petroleum products of other oil companies."
531,19," The letter agreement was amended by two letter agreements dated May 1, 1965 (Exhs. 38 and 39) respectively substituting 
Estron Oil Corp. and Bill Wold Petroleum as distributors, in place and stead of Newtal. "
532,20," As part of its agreement to finance the construction of the service station Linmont gave Amoco a ten (10) year option to lease 
the station at a rental computed at the rate of two cents per gallon of the gasoline delivered to the station (Exh. 50). "

533,21," The liensincluded a second mortgage lien in favor of the Estate of Isidore Usiskin for $ 110,000 plus interest.  This 
indebtedness represented part of the purchase price for the Usiskin stock acquired at his death."
533,22," Linmont received $ 2,260.50. "
534,23," Wisser by letter dated August 31, 1975 ordered the removal of all Amoco equipment."
534,24," The defense of the statute of limitations is worthy of brief mention.  Linmont v. American Oil Company, N.N. & W., et al. was 
commenced by the filing of a complaint in the office of the Clerk of this Court on January 7, 1974.  Though proof of the acts 
constituting the alleged conspiracy may be offered to establish the conspiracy ""the plaintiff is allowed to recover damages 
resulting only from those acts committed less than four years before commencement of the suit."" Imperial Point Colonnades

damage during the period January 7, 1970 to January 7, 1974. "
539,1," Because plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden under Rule 23(b)(3), it is unnecessary for me to determine whether the 
requisites of Rule 23(a) have been met."
539,2," I emphasize that I did not require a showing of the manner of common proof of the amount of damages each individual class 
member sustained, but rather a showing of the manner in which the mere fact of damage could be proven on a common basis. "
542,3, See Exhibit A. 
554,1," .  While other papers are distributed by some of these independent distributors, it can be said their contribution to the total is de 
minimis. "
556,2," .  Defendants point to Lamara and Millcarek v. Miami Publishing Co., 388 F. Supp. 1002 (S.D.Fla.1975) in support of their claim 
that they cannot conspire among one another.  Lamarca and Millcarek involved an employee-employer relationship.  The case at 
bar concerns independent contractors.  Lamarca and Millcarek, therefore, are inapposite."
556,3," .  Indeed, there was evidence that at certain times the Journal and Southern New England were at cross purposes."

557,," contrary.  There the court found two newspapers to be mere extensions of a sole owner.  That court further held there had been 
no proof of monopoly power, nor of coercive or predatory practices."
557,5," .  Defendants' reliance on Naify v. McClatchy Newspapers, 599 F.2d 335 (9th Cir. 1979) and Newberry v. Washington Post Co., 
438 F. Supp. 470 (D.D.C.1977) is misapplied.  In Naify there was no evidence of any attempt to maintain retail prices.  Similarly 
in Newberry, with the exception of one instance, there was no evidence of coercion.  Thus a combination could not be found. "
559,6, .  Defendants underwrite part of the cost of delivery for distributors whose area is rural. 
560,7, .  No testimony was offered concerning the cross elasticity between the Journal's newspapers and the out-of-state dailies.

575,2," There are no federal appellate court decisions evaluating the membership criteria for real estate multiple listing services, and 
only a few in the federal district courts. See, e. g., Brown v. Indianapolis Board of Realtors, 1977-1 Trade Cases P 61,435 
(S.D.Ind.1977); Oglesby & Barclift, Inc. v. Metro MLS, Inc., 1976-2 Trade Cases P 61,064 (E.D.Va.1976). We have found some 
guidance, however, in a number of state court decisions, relying on federal antitrust precedent, which deal with this problem. 
See, e. g., Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Cedar Rapids Real Estate Board, 1980-1 Trade Cases P 63,012 (Iowa Dist.Ct.1979); Marin

575,3," The facts relevant to the organization and growth of RML and to the promulgation of, and amendments to, its rules, regulations 
and by-laws are, in general, undisputed. Where there exists any dispute as to a material fact or where there is no evidence 
relating to such fact, it will be noted in the opinion. "
576,4," The member-stockholders of RML are principal brokers. All sales agents of such member brokers are required to join as 
associate members. While associate members must agree to abide by RML by-laws, rules and regulations, they pay no dues, 
hold no stock and have no vote. R.683a. All citations to the record in this case will be in the form used above."
576,5," In an ""exclusive"" listing, the seller agrees to list with only one broker. The listing broker is then guaranteed a share of the 
commission even if another broker eventually secures a buyer. In an ""open"" listing, any broker may list and sell the property, and 
only the selling broker is entitled to the commission."
576,6," RML Rules and Regulations require that all new and used single family residences located in Muscogee County for which an 
RML broker has obtained an exclusive listing be turned in to RML for distribution to all members. Other types of property, such 
as farmland or commercial property, whether located in Muscogee County or elsewhere, may be listed with RML at the member 
broker's option. In the event an owner refuses to allow an RML broker to list his property with RML, the listing may be taken by 
the broker as an office exclusive. The broker must nonetheless provide RML with listing data and cooperate with a member in 
connection with the sale of such property. R.686-687. "
577,7," Shortly after RML was formed, a competing multiple listing service was organized under the name Multiple Selling Service, 
later changed to Columbus Multiple Listing Service. Although it achieved at least a modicum of success, it suffered a severe 
setback in the early 1970's when most of its active members left to join RML. Deposition of Earl Bowden at 27-30; 51; 73-80; 
Deposition of Donald Watson at 46-52; Deposition of Ezekial Carter at 10-14. After the Carter Realty Company, one of the 
competing service's major members and one of Columbus' largest brokerage firms, was rejected by RML, the Carter firm, along 
with several other brokers, attempted to revitalize the competing service. Despite its success, the effort was abandoned in 1975 
when the Carter firm and most of the competing service's members were finally accepted into RML. Deposition of Earl Bowden 
at 51-51; 61; 80; 84-86; Deposition of Donald Watson at 62-63; 80-81; 83-93; Deposition of Beatrice Breaux at 49-52. Until October 1975, RML's rules prohibited any member from belonging to a competing multiple listing service. R.379."
577,8," RML Rule 5(9) provides: Each member shall keep his file of RML listings confidential and shall see to it that no Broker who is not an RML Member, and 
no salesperson not associated with an RML Member shall ever have access to them. R.688. "
578,9," RML Rule 5(8) provides: It is intended that the listing Broker only share or Co-Broker the listing with Non-RML members. Any inquiries from non-RML 
members must be referred to the listing Broker for information and showing of the property. R.688. See R.686a."
578,10," Among the duties of RML's central office is the following: ""To maintain a confidential atmosphere in the office, giving out no information to anyone not a member of Realty-Multi-List, Inc."" 
R.686."
578,11," In October 1973, the Department of Justice advised RML that its membership restrictions and high initiation fees might be in 
violation of the antitrust laws. R.157-158. During the negotiations which followed, RML, as discussed in the text below, amended 
some of its rules. On several occasions, representatives of the Department and RML met to attempt to negotiate a consent 
decree. When they failed to reach an accord on the terms of the decree, the United States filed suit."
578,12," Section 1 provides, in pertinent part: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
578,13, The rules provide no standards whatsoever to guide the members in casting their votes.
578,14," Article V, Section 5 sets forth the following criteria: MEMBERSHIP: To be eligible for membership in Realty Multi-List, Inc., a broker must: (a) Hold an active real estate Principal Broker's license in the State of Georgia. "
579,," (b) Have an active real estate office in Muscogee County. (c) Have a favorable credit report and business reputation. (d) Agree to abide by the Realty Multi-List, Inc. By-Laws and Rules & Regulations. (e) Purchase one (1) share of stock in Realty Multi-List, Inc., at a price set by the Board of Directors. A prospective future member's application shall be forwarded to the President of Realty Multi-List, Inc. The President shall 
submit the prospective member's application to the membership committee for their investigation of the applicant. The 
membership committee will then report their findings to the President in writing."
579,15," Although this requirement is nowhere specified in RML's rules, RML has taken the position in this appeal that it so interprets 
its ""active real estate office"" rule and that, as construed, the rule is valid. We thus treat the requirement as part of RML's Rules 
and Regulations. The language is derived from the criteria developed by the National Association of Realtors for membership in 
a Member Board of Realtors. R.234."
579,16," From June 13, 1975, to December 17, 1975, RML also imposed a requirement that, before applying for admission to RML, a 
broker must have maintained an office of his own for at least six months. R.708-709, 713."
579,17," The relief sought by the United States, as summarized in its brief, is a declaration that RML's past and present restrictive rules are unlawful, and โฆ an injunction ordering that RML: (1) be required 
to afford access to its listings and related services to any state licensed broker requesting it; (2) be required to charge only fees 
and dues for access which are reasonably related to a member's pro rata share of the costs of operating defendant, including 
the accumulation and maintenance of reasonable reserves for developing, maintaining, or improving defendant as a going 
concern; (3) be prohibited from restricting or limiting the admission of new members (or affiliation of new users) through 
moratoria on new memberships or affiliations; (4) be prohibited from imposing any restrictions on a member's (or a user's) place 
of business or office hours; (5) be prohibited from restricting or preventing any member (or user) from advertising any type of 
real property; (6) be prohibited from preventing any member (or user) from belonging to or utilizing the services of any other 
multiple listing service; and (7) be restrained from continuing, or renewing any other concert of action having a similar purpose or 
effect. Brief for United States at 2 n.1. "
580,18," The Government has argued that, despite its mootness holding, the district court went on to uphold the legality of RML's past 
practices by stating near the end of its opinion that ""Defendant's operation has not in the past unreasonably restrained 
competitionโฆ."" In light of the fact that the district court expressly held the controversy regarding the past practices moot and 
made no inquiry as to the reasonableness vel non of these practices, the opinion cannot reasonably bear the construction the 
Government puts upon it. "
581,19," In Poller, supra, the Supreme Court observed that summary judgment procedures should be used sparingly in complex 
antitrust litigation.  82 S. Ct. at 491. This cautionary note does not mean, of course, that they will never appropriate in this type of 
litigation. See, e. g., First National Bank v. Cities Services Co., 391 U.S. 253, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)."
581,20," The concerted action necessary to establish a Section 1 violation exists in the agreement of RML's members to adopt and 
apply these rules and membership criteria. See Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 1252 n. 5, 10 
L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963); Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 1421, 89 L. Ed. 2d 2013 (1945)."
581,21," For reasons detailed in Part D(3) infra, it is not significant that we are not called upon here specifically to review any one 
exclusion from RML. Only one individual has in fact been excluded from RML under its present membership criteria, and the 
Government has not sought an order specifically requiring that he be admitted, although it has suggested that that exclusion was 
unreasonable. "
582,22," The district court refused to characterize RML's practices as a group boycott because a listing broker remains free to 
cooperate with a nonmember on an individual basis for the sale of his listings. The Silver court rejected an analogous argument. 
It adhered to its characterization of the removal of Silver's private wire services as a group boycott despite ""the fact that the 
collective refusal to deal was only with reference to the private wires, the member firms remaining willing to deal with petitioners 
for the purchase and sale of securities."" Wire service itself was ""a valuable business service germane to petitioners' business 
and important to their effective competition with others,"" so that concerted withdrawal of access to that service, without any 
justification, violated Section 1. Id. at 1252 n. 5. "
583,23," ""This principle of per se unreasonableness not only makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act 
more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged 
economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine at 
large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable-an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when undertaken."" Northern Pac. 
R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). See Continental TV, Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, 
Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50 n. 16, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2558 n. 16, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 
U.S. 596, 609 n. 10, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1134 n. 10, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). Id., 99 S. Ct. at 1556 n. 11."
583,24," The Court noted that blanket licensing aided in the effectuation of rights granted under the copyright laws, id. at 1562, 
accompanied the integration of sales, monitoring and copyright enforcement facilities, id., was, to some extent, a ""different 
product"" than an individual license, id. at 1563, and did not fully eliminate the presence of price competition. Id. at 1564."
583,25," The Court noted that the market impact of these restraints was complex ""because of their potential for a simultaneous 
reduction of intrabrand competition and stimulation of interbrand competition."" Id. at 2558."
583,26," We need to know more than we do about the actual impact of these arrangements on competition to decide whether they 
have such a ""pernicious effect on competition and lack โฆ any redeeming virtue"" ( Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, supra, 
356 U.S. p. 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, (p. 518)) and therefore should be classified as per se violations of the Sherman Act. Id. at 702. "
585,27," More generally, in characterizing this conduct under the per se rule, our inquiry must focus on whether the effect and, here 
because it tends to show effect, see United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 436, n. 13, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 2873 
n. 13, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978), the purpose of the practice is to threaten the proper operation of our predominantly free market 
economy-that is, whether the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition 
and decrease output, and in what portion of the market, or instead one designed to ""increase economic efficiency and render 
markets more rather than less competitive."" Id. (footnote omitted)."
585,28," The Supreme Court in BMI provided one important caveat regarding the characterization of a particular form of a restraint as 
within or without the per se rule: The scrutiny occasionally required must not merely subsume the burdensome analysis required under the rule of reason, see 
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 690-692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1364-1366, 55 L. Ed. 2d 
637 (1978), or else we should apply the rule of reason from the start. That is why the per se rule is not employed until after 
considerable experience with the type of challenged restraint. Id. 99 S. Ct. at 1562 n.33."
585,29," Regardless of whether one concludes that the Court in Chicago Board of Trade reached the proper conclusion, see National 
Society of Professional Engineers, supra, 98 S. Ct. at 1366 n.19; L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 66 (1977), it is clear that its mode of 
analysis fit the form outlined above. See 38 S. Ct. at 244-245. "
587,30," Two cases often included in a summary of the Supreme Court's per se group boycott rulings, Associated Press v. United 
States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945), and Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 83 S. Ct. 
1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963), see McQuade, supra, 467 F.2d at 186, actually do not belong there. Although some of the Court's analysis in Associated Press, supra, is directed toward the problems of group boycotts in the trade 
association context, see 65 S. Ct. at 1423-1424, the practice which the Court held to be per se illegal is more accurately 
described as horizontal territorial division. The Court struck down as per se violations the AP bylaws which gave members the 
right essentially to veto the admission of new members competing in their territories, but explicitly declined to void those rules 
prohibiting the provision of AP news to nonmembers. Id. at 1425-1426. Justice Douglas, in his concurring opinion, specifically 
called attention to this aspect of the Court's holding, noting that the decree ""does not direct Associated Press to serve all 
applicants"" and that membership restrictions, of themselves, pose ""quite different problems."" Id. at 1427. Cf.  United States v. 
Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (voiding as per se horizontal market division 
analogous territorial restrictions). Although the broad language of Silver, supra, certainly invites a per se reading, this Court has interpreted it as a rule of reason 
holding. In Hatley v. American Quarter Horse Association, 552 F.2d 646 (5th Cir.1977), the Court noted: The termination was held to violate Section 1, but the Silver Court did not hold this particular boycott to be illegal per se as might 
have been expected under Fashion Originators' Guild v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 468, 61 S. Ct. 703, 708, 85 L. Ed. 949 (1941), and 
Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). Instead it noted that ""absent any 
justification derived from the policy of another statute or otherwise,"" the defendant's action would have been a per se violation.  
373 U.S. at 348-49, 83 S. Ct. at 1252 (emphasis added). Because the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established a policy 
favoring self-regulation, the Court proceeded under the rule of reason and ultimately found the boycott illegal. The cryptic phrase ""or otherwise"" has been fastened upon as a signal that a statute is not essential to avoid per se treatment of 
an apparent group boycott. ""A concerted refusal to deal may, under Silver, be validated by a public policy in favor of collective action. Two types of 
justification may be postulated: those derived from governmental expressions of purpose, and those which result from the need 
for self-regulation inherent in the industry."" Id. at 652 (citations omitted). Although this reading attributes a great deal of meaning to the Court's ""cryptic"" phrase ""or 
otherwise,"" there is an additional reason for construing Silver as outside the per se principle. The Silver Court focused extensively in its discussion of the exclusion of plaintiffs on the market power of the Stock Exchange 
and the tremendous significance of its services to plaintiffs' business. These factors, especially the emphasis on market power, 
are usually not directly relevant to per se analysis, see pp. 1362-1363 supra, but may be vitally important to rule of reason 
analysis. See pp. 1372-1374 infra. "
588,31, See p. 1356 supra.
588,32," As the Court explained in Continental T.V., supra, the applicability of the per se rule should be assessed in terms of the 
general type of restraint involved: The location restriction used by Sylvania was neither the least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have usedโฆ. But 
we agree with the implicit judgment in (U.S. v. Arnold ) Schwinn (& Co., 388 U.S. 365, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249) that a 
per se rule based on the nature of the restriction is, in general, undesirable. Although distinctions can be drawn among the 
frequently used restrictions, we are inclined to view them as differences of degree and formโฆ. We are unable to perceive 
significant social gain from channeling transaction into one form or another."
588,97," S. Ct. at 2561 n.29 (citations omitted). Similarly, here, we look to whether membership criteria of the general type involved 
merit per se treatment. "
589,33," An example of an almost purely internal restraint imposed by RML is its rule governing solicitation of future listings of an 
exclusive listing held by an RML member. Rule 5(5) of RML's Rules and Regulations provides: During the life of an RML Exclusive, no solicitations on the subject of listing changes or future listing of the property are to be 
made by any member of RML or his salespeople other than the listing Broker and his salespeople. R.687a. While this rule does affect the property owner, it is clearly intended to govern RML's internal operation and doubtlessly 
that is its principal effect. RML brokers of necessity disclose their exclusive listings to all other brokers. In order to induce them to 
disclose the listings, the brokers require some insurance that the disclosure will not afford competitors an opportunity to ""steal"" 
them. "
590,34," Quoted in Note, Arbitrary Exclusion from Multiple Listing: Common Law and Statutory Remedies, 52 Cornell L.Q. 570 (1967)."
590,35," Indirect effects of denial of membership include, for example, the inability to attract and retain sales people, with a resulting 
impediment to a firm's ability to expand its operations, see Deposition of Bernard Friedman at 16; Deposition of Donald Watson 
at 29-30, 35-35, 102; Deposition of T. M. Lowe at 22; Deposition of Clyde Averett at 13; Deposition of Jane Wright at 12, 24; and 
often a stigma on a broker's professional image. See Deposition of T. M. Lowe at 14-15, 19."
590,36," Under RML's rules, the listing broker always gets a share of the commission no matter who sells the property. R.690-691. "
591,37," On a theoretical level, this unjustified exclusion is an example of the predatory use of an economy of scale. As one 
commentator has explained, The threat of boycott is likely to be particularly effective in the case of cooperating groups because a group often creates an 
economy of scale to which any firm must have access in order to be profitable. A trader excluded from the Chicago Board of 
Trade, a broker excluded from the stock exchange, or a professional football team turned out of its league is likely to have a very 
hard time of it. โฆ (T)here is no doubt that predation can succeed when the distribution pattern is so much more efficient than the alternative 
that those forced out of the pattern cannot compete. The technique of predation is the denial of access to an essential economy 
of scale. Boards of trade, for example, often control such access, and their members may often easily destroy a troublesome 
rival by expelling him from membership or, perhaps more commonly, may bring a rival into line with the mere threat of expulsion. R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 336, 158 (1978)."
591,38," Although the Terminal Railroad case is sometimes read as a monopolization case, see e. g., L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 48 (1977), 
the case also involved a Section 1 charge since the Terminal Association was, in essence, a combination of competing railroads. 
See 32 S. Ct. at 515. If one reads Terminal Railroad as a Section 1 case, it fits squarely within the rationale of the other cases 
cited in text, and, in addition, this reading helps to alleviate many of the problems regarding a monopolist's duty to deal raised by 
the case. See, e. g., L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 48 (1977). Cf.  Fulton v. Hecht, 580 F.2d 1243, 1248 & n. 2 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 440 U.S. 981, 99 S. Ct. 1789, 60 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1979) (making analogous point regarding the Deesen case, cited infra)."
591,39," HN27[
] The assessment of the market power of the association, and its consequent potential for inflicting competitive harm, 
of necessity requires the definition of the relevant market. See Marin County Board of Realtors, supra, 1976-1 Trade Cases at "
592,68," ,900. Here, it is undisputed that the relevant product market is the market for residential real estate brokerage services. See 
id. It is also necessary to assess the relevant geographic market. As one commentator has observed in the context of a case 
similar to that before us, "" United States v. Times-Picayune Pub. Co. (105 F. Supp. 670 (E.D.La.1950), rev'd on other grounds, 
345 U.S. 594, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953)) indicated that competitors must be foreclosed from a substantial market or 
part of a market for there to be restraint under the Sherman Act. If such a substantial impact on competition must be shown, it 
would seem to necessitate the determination of a relevant geographic market in order that the effect on competition therein may 
be realistically appraised."" Note, Arbitrary Exclusion from Multiple Listing: Common Law and Statutory Remedies, 52 Cornell 
L.Q. 570, 576-578 (1967) (footnotes omitted). See Marin County Board of Realtors, supra, 1976-1 Trade Cases at 68,900; 
Austin, Real Estate Boards and Multiple Listing Systems as Restraints of Trade, 70 Colum.L.Rev. 1325, 1356 n.196 (1970). The Government has treated Muscogee County as the relevant geographic market in this case, and RML has not suggested 
otherwise. In reviewing the summary judgment for RML, therefore, we accept this area as the relevant market. Neither party has 
focused closely on this issue, however, and it will be left open on remand. We call the parties' attention to one important 
observation on this matter: Courts in rule of reason cases seldom proceed to engage in the meticulous analysis of power that is associated with 
monopolization cases. The issue is not whether defendants possess monopoly power, but whether they possess a substantial 
degree of market power. On this issue, a truncated or threshold analysis will suffice. For example, if defendants possess 
substantial shares of the market for a well differentiated product such as cellophane, we would assume significant power without 
scrupulous inquiry into cross-elasticity of substitute products. Courts are understandably loath to move into the intricacies and 
imponderables of thorough-going analysis of power and tend to avoid doing so where the need is not insistent. L. Sullivan, Antitrust 192 (1977)."
592,40," HN28[
] If an association lacks market power, it is of course unlikely that serious anticompetitive effects will result from 
exclusions from membership. Thus, in Associated Press, supra, the Supreme Court indicated that an exclusive dealing 
arrangement between a reporter and his paper or between two papers in different cities would present quite different questions 
than the arrangement before it.  65 S. Ct. at 1422. Cf.  Northern Pacific Railway Co., supra, 78 S. Ct. at 519 (analogous point 
regarding tying arrangements). A significant proportion of the cases that we have found upholding the membership requirements of multiple listing services rest 
at least in part upon a finding that the service lacked the requisite market power. See, e. g., Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Cedar Rapids 
Real Estate Board, 1980-1 Trade Cases P 63,012 (Iowa Dist.Ct.1979); Brown v. Indianapolis Board of Realtors, 1977-1 Trade 
Cases P 61,435 (S.D.Ind.1977); Blake v. H-F Group MLS, 36 Ill. App. 3d 730, 345 N.E.2d 18 (Ill.App.Ct.1976); Grempler v. 
Multiple Listing Bureau, 1970 Trade Cases P 73,204 (Md.Ct.App.1970)."
592,41," Professor Robert Bork styles restraints of this type ""disguised naked boycotts."" R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 335-337 
(1978)."
592,42," One may expect that, in the case of most multiple listing services, the service will strive toward market dominance. As we 
have shown, the primary incentive to form a multiple listing service comes from the drive to overcome the market imperfections 
inherent in the real estate industry. These imperfections are overcome in direct proportion to the service's ability to attract sellers 
and brokers to bring their listings to it. Thus, at least in theoretical terms, the larger the service, the more effectively it may 
operate. See Note, Arbitrary Exclusion from Multiple Listing: Common Law and Statutory Remedies, 52 Cornell L.Q. 570 (1967). 
And, of course, the more the service strives toward this goal, the greater the danger of anticompetitive exclusions becomes. Id. "
593,," In this case, the facts reveal that RML has in fact undertaken the drive to market dominance. See note 46 infra and 
accompanying text."
593,43," Analysis might be different, for example, in a situation where the market, before the formation of the listing service, was 
fragmented into a large number of small firms than in an instance where the market was divided evenly between one large firm, 
which stays out of the service, and a number of small firms."
593,44," When these conditions are satisfied, the argument that formation of a new listing service remains a possibility is generally 
irrelevant. Where the existing service has already achieved significant market power, the formation of a separate competing 
service can only serve to perpetuate some degree of market imperfection. Moreover, ""(t)he Act does not merely guarantee the 
right to create markets; it also ensures the right of entry to old ones."" Gamco, supra, 194 F.2d at 487; see American Federation 
of Tobacco Growers, supra, 183 F.2d at 872."
593,45," As in the case of the relevant market determination, see note 39 supra, we do not consider whether the record establishes 
this point conclusively, although the Government's evidence, as detailed in text, is strong. Since neither party has focused 
closely on the degree of RML's dominance in the market, this issue should be open to the parties on remand."
593,46, See note 7 supra. 
594,," The Government introduced strong deposition testimony that the competing listing service initially went into eclipse and then, 
after having been revitalized, finally disbanded after RML members indicated that brokers who left the competing service would 
be admitted to RML. See Deposition of Earl Bowden at 36, 61; Deposition of Donald Watson at 51-53; 85-87."

594,48, See Deposition of Kaethey Earley at 70; Deposition of Earl Bowden at 26.
594,49," The mode of analysis we outline here is quite similar to that first envisioned under the rule of reason by Judge Taft in his 
opinion in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 
(1899). After identifying five classes of ancillary restraints upheld by the common law, he stated: It would be stating it too strongly to say that these five classes of covenants in restraint of trade include all of those upheld as 
valid at the common law; but it would certainly seem to follow from the tests laid down for determining the validity of such an 
agreement that no conventional restraint of trade can be enforced unless the covenant embodying it is merely ancillary to the 
main purpose of a lawful contract, and necessary to protect the covenantee in the enjoyment of the legitimate fruits of the 
contract, or to protect him from the dangers of an unjust use of those fruits by the other party. This very statement of the rule implies that the contract must be one in which there is a main purpose, to which the covenant in 
restraint of trade is merely ancillary. The covenant is inserted only to protect one of the parties from the injury which, in the 
execution of the contract or enjoyment of its fruits, he may suffer from the unrestrained competition of the other. The main 
purpose of the contract suggests the measure of protection needed, and furnishes a sufficiently uniform standard by which the 
validity of such restraints may be judicially determined. In such a case, if the restraint exceeds the necessity presented by the 
main purpose of the contract, it is void for two reasons: First, because it oppresses the covenantor, without any corresponding 
benefit to the covenantee; and, second, because it tends to a monopoly. Id. at 282."
594,50," Assume that a group of real estate brokers, through an association, exchanges listings and agrees to share commissions 
where one broker obtains a listing and another finds a buyer; this arrangement will reduce the incentives of members to provide 
listings to or to obtain them from non-members. In (this hypothetical) the venture has as a likely consequence a withdrawal of trading opportunities from non-member 
competitors which may be useful to those competitors in their efforts to compete. If the venture is presently or potentially so 
powerful that loss of access will greatly reduce the competitive effectiveness of non-member firms, and if firms which want to 
enter are not permitted to do so on reasonable terms, elaborate analysis is not needed to support the conclusion that any gains "
595,," in efficiency are outweighed by the anticompetitive effect; indeed, it may be suspected that the stifling effect on non-members 
may have been a purpose for the venture. Id."
595,51," HN35[
] Even if a rule survives this facial analysis, it may still be condemned upon full analysis under the rule of reason, 
when the court determines its actual effects in the marketplace. Moreover, an individual broker would still be allowed to 
challenge his exclusion under a valid rule which he alleges has been discriminatorily applied."
595,52," Membership criteria for a multiple listing service present problems in this regard which are often distinct from those presented 
by those for a Board of Realtors. As we have already pointed out, a multiple listing service is directly involved in its members' 
commercial activities; its activities correspond directly with its members' buying and selling process. Austin, Real Estate Boards 
and Multiple Listing Systems as Restraints of Trade, 20 Colum.L.Rev. 1325, 1345-1346 (1970). Arbitrary exclusion from 
membership thus possesses serious anticompetitive potential. A Board of Realtors, on the other hand, may be less directly 
involved with its members' business and, therefore, the enforcement of membership criteria founded upon ethical and 
professional norms may have a less direct impact on competition. Since RML is not affiliated with a Board of Realtors, this case 
presents this distinction in its starkest form. The California Supreme Court has held in a very similar case that, while a Board of 
Relators may exclude nonmembers from access to many of its services, it cannot exclude licensed real estate brokers from 
access to the Board-sponsored multiple listing service.  Marin County Board of Realtors, supra, 1976-1 Trade Cases at 68,901. "
596,53," If one asserts, in support of its reasonableness, that a joint venture affords a significant potential for scale efficiencies not 
otherwise available, one is also asserting that the call of the venture to its participants is the rather insistent call of a potentially 
large increase in profits. It can then be argued that if the venturers really regard the venture as yielding significant efficiencies, 
they ought to be ready to proceed without the added inducement of a license to boycott nonmembers. L. Sullivan, Antitrust 254-255 (1977) (footnote omitted). "
597,54," Indeed, it has been suggested that state-licensing requirements for real estate brokers are themselves so stringent as to have 
serious anticompetitive effects. See Austin, Real Estate Boards and Multiple Listing Systems as Restraints of Trade, 70 
Colum.L.Rev. 1325, 1351-1352 (1970)."

licensed in his state of residence: Provided, that nothing contained in the subsection or any other provision of this section shall 
be construed so as to prohibit the payment of earned commissions to the estate or heirs of a deceased real estate broker, 
associate broker, associate broker or real estate salesperson when such deceased real estate broker, associate broker or real "

such person's death; (18) failing to include a fixed date of expiration in any written listing agreement, and failing to leave a copy of said agreement

purchaser and to the seller; (20) failure by a broker to deliver to the seller in every real estate transaction, at the time said transaction is consummated, a 
complete, detailed closing statement showing all of the receipts and disbursements handled by such broker for the seller, or 
failure to deliver to the buyer a complete statement showing all money received in said transaction from such buyer and how and 
for what the same was disbursed; the broker shall retain true copies of such statements in his file; (21) making any substantial misrepresentations; (22) acting for more than one party in a transaction without the knowledge of all parties for whom he acts; (23) failure of an associate broker or salesman to place, as soon after receipt as is practicable possible, in the custody of the

transaction. Id."
599,60," In Barrows, supra, 214 N.W.2d at 535, 540, the court gave little weight to the presence of state regulation of brokers where 
there was expert testimony indicating that the state regulatory scheme was inadequate to meet the needs of the multiple listing 
service. Similarly in Cedar Rapids Real Estate Board, supra, 1980-1 Trade Cases at 77,040, the court accorded minimal 
significance to the state regulatory scheme where evidence showed that the state's real estate commission regularly referred 
complaints to the local board for resolution. "
600,61," A court must presume that the state's legislative determination of what is necessary for public protection is correct and that 
the state adequately enforces its rules and regulations. Thus the burden of showing that it requires protection greater than that 
provided by the state or that the state does not adequately enforce its rules must rest upon the association."
600,62," Rule 15, Article 5, of RML's Rules and Regulations provides: It is the duty of the Realtor to protect the public against fraud, misrepresentation, and unethical practices in real estate 
transactions. He should endeavor to eliminate in his community any practices which could be damaging to the public or bring 
discredit to the real estate profession. The Realtor should assist the governmental agency charged with regulating the practices 
of brokers and salesmen in his state. R.691a."
600,63," Conceivably, RML might validly establish a rule barring admission of an applicant to membership while any charges brought 
against him with the Commission are pending. Upon the resolution of the charges favorably to the applicant, however, the 
justification for exclusion would expire. "
601,64," One of these members defined the criteria as requiring an applicant to be ""a person of high moral turpitude,"" with a ""high 
degree of judiciary capacity""; ""I want to be sure, before I vote for him that he is a fellow that I don't mind coming into my house."" 
He added that ""a favorable credit report is just what it says it is(. I)t is a sort of a gauge of what sort of businessman this is that is 
asking to come in and associate with a majority of the brokers in Columbus โฆ."" Deposition of Robert Rowe at 25-26. Another 
testified that the criteria required that an applicant be ""doing business on a creditable scale"" and conceded that ""each person 
would have a different value and idea of what is a favorable business reputation."" Deposition of George Adams at 37. See 
Deposition of Wendell Lewis at 19-20; Deposition of Charles French at 58."
601,65," RML has contended in its brief on this appeal that its ""favorable credit report and business reputation"" standards are 
interpreted in accordance with the 8-point membership criteria of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The NAR criteria 
define their ""sound credit rating"" standard in the following terms: By ""sound credit rating"" is meant that the applicant is not involved in any pending bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or 
otherwise involved in financial problems which could reasonably be expected to jeopardize those persons doing business with 
him. The evaluation of an applicant's credit rating shall be based on objective data and not on rumor or a general reputation for 
being ""slow pay."" R.235. The NAR criteria define their ""favorable business reputation in the community"" standard as follows: By ""favorable reputation in the community"" is meant that the applicant is not subject to any unresolved charges of civil rights 
violations, violations of consumer protection laws, violations of the real estate license laws, or other violations of law. It is not 
intended that ""reputation"" be evaluated on subjective impressions or hearsay. R.234. If RML did in fact adhere to these standards, a more difficult question would be presented. See note 63 supra. But as we have 
shown, neither the RML rules themselves nor the testimony of RML members support the contention that its rules incorporate 
these qualifications. Moreover, in light of the evidence mentioned, the district court's suggestion that RML's criteria are ""capable 
of objective determination"" (emphasis supplied) is irrelevant. Nor can we attribute any great significance, in the circumstances, to RML's use of ""special character financial"" reports from the 
Equifax Credit Bureau. In addition to business and financial information, these reports contain personal information, such as an 
evaluation of the applicant's marital status, drinking habits and neighborhood, which the Board of Directors considers in 
evaluating an applicant's fitness to be an RML member. Deposition of Betty Meroney at 95-96, 106-107, 166-167. Further, RML 
members are allowed to supply any additional information they personally possess about the applicant to the Board for its 
consideration. Id. at 167-169, RML does not seek to verify any of this information with the applicant himself, nor does it notify the 
applicant of the reasons for his rejection. Id. at 169-170; R.701-703. Procedures of this type cannot cure the subjectivity inherent 
in the standards themselves. Cf.  Hatley, supra, 552 F.2d at 653. "
602,66," It has been suggested that in some cases the association cannot define its membership criteria in objective terms. For 
example, courts have pointed out that it may be impossible to establish fully objective measures of an individual's ability to play 
golf in a competitive manner, see Deesen, supra, 358 F.2d at 167 or of what constitutes a quarter horse. See Hatley, supra, 552 
F.2d at 652-653. In this case, however, it is clear that RML can more objectively define its membership criteria than it has done 
in its present rules. The standards adopted by the NAR establish this point beyond cavil. See note 65 supra. In light of Georgia's 
regulatory scheme and the danger of anticompetitive exclusions, it is incumbent upon RML to define its criteria with more 
particularity."
602,67," Our conclusion that these criteria are not narrowly tailored to serve any legitimate goal of RML is the only reasonable 
inference from the undisputed facts, as our analysis demonstrates. We leave open on remand the questions of market power 
and state preemption of this area of regulation."
602,68," Georgia law neither requires, nor permits, the Georgia Real Estate Commission to consider a broker's office hours in granting 
or refusing a license or in any of its other regulatory activities. See O'Neal v. Georgia Real Estate Commission, 129 Ga.App. 
211, 199 S.E.2d 362 (1973). For this reason and also because RML's attempted justifications are based on needs peculiar to a 
multiple listing service, we have no question of state preemption of this area."
602,69," RML has not argued, nor could it do so successfully, that this requirement is justified by reference to its need to insure the 
competence and responsibility of its members. The exclusion of brokers who do not maintain customary office hours on the 
theory that it promotes this goal would clearly be a response in excess of need. See Marin County Board of Realtors, supra, 
1976-1 Trade Cases at 68,902. In addition, the district court's conclusion that this rule was justified because it prevented the excluded brokers from selling or 
giving away the confidential information supplied by RML is simply erroneous. There is no reason to conclude that the class of 
brokers excluded by this rule is more likely to commit these acts than is any other group. Moreover, RML has a specific rule "
603,," prohibiting the disclosure of such information. See note 8 supra. On this appeal, RML has not defended the rule on the grounds 
asserted by the district court."
603,70," For example, RML's Rule 12(1) provides in pertinent part: All offers must be submitted to the listing Broker for presentation to the seller. Under no circumstances is the selling Broker or 
his agents permitted to make direct contact with the seller without permission from the listing Broker. The selling Broker or agent 
normally may accompany the listing Broker to present the offer as a silent party. Only by invitation of the listing Broker may the 
selling Broker speak during the time the offer is being submitted to the seller. The final authority whether the selling Broker 
accompany the listing Broker rests exclusively with the listing Broker. R.690."
603,71," RML's lockbox system, whereby a lockbox containing a house key is affixed to the listed property and every member can 
obtain a master key to the lockbox, alleviates some of the burdens of servicing a listing. By gaining access to the house key in 
this manner, the selling broker can show the property without the presence or consent of the listing broker."
603,72," RML might, for example, require that all members furnish a set of phone numbers at which they can be reached and might 
establish precise sanctions for brokers who fail to service their listings in a reasonable manner. In fact, RML already has some 
rules of this type, the violation of which could be sanctioned under existing procedures. Rule 12(1) provides in pertinent part: The listing Broker shall see that any offer is presented promptly to the seller for his consideration. If the listing agent or the listing 
Broker is unavailable to present the offer within a reasonable time, then the listing Broker should have an established procedure 
who in his firm will present offers. The offer must be presented to the seller within a reasonable time. Under no circumstances 
will the selling Broker or his agent without express permission from listing Broker or his agent be allowed to make direct contact 
with the seller. R.690. "
604,73," The fact that it may be more socially convenient for a majority of RML's members to conduct all their business during 
customary working hours does not serve to justify RML's practices in competitive terms. See L. Sullivan, Antitrust 178-179, 186-
189 (1977). As we have shown, the Sherman Act looks only to a restraint's effect upon competition. In Chicago Board of Trade, 
supra, where the Supreme Court upheld a trade exchange rule prohibiting the making of prices after the close of established 
trading hours, the Court found that the practice promoted competition by making the day market more perfect.  38 S. Ct. at 244-
245. See BMI, supra, 99 S. Ct. at 1564 n.41; National Society of Professional Engineers, supra, 98 S. Ct. at 1366 n.19. Here, by 
contrast, the market is ""made"" when a listing is submitted to RML and circulated to its members. As long as RML members 
reasonably service their listings, the hours they keep is a matter best left to their own personal preference."
604,74, The district court also construed this rule to allow these results. R.1734.
604,75," The minutes of RML's July 9, 1976, Board of Directors' Meeting, for example, indicate the RML erroneously believed that the 
Georgia Real Estate Commission would either refuse a license to, or would revoke the license of, a broker who intended to 
practice on less than a full time basis. Those same minutes indicate that RML's attorney advised RML against signing a 
proposed consent decree because it eliminated the customary hours rule and would permit ""a serviceman in the performance of 
full time duty (to) be allowed membership in RML, just as any other broker โฆ."" R.705. See Deposition of Earl Bowden at 98-99; 
Deposition of Donald Watson at 128-134; Deposition of Kaethey Earley at 48-49; Deposition of Jane Wright at 35-36; Deposition 
of Ezekial Carter at 46-47; Deposition of Henry Barbian at 33-34."
604,76, See pp. 1375-1376 supra.
604,77," Our conclusion that RML's ""customary hours"" rule is overly broad is the only reasonable inference from the undisputed facts; 
thus, assuming that RML possesses the requisite market power, the rule should be stricken."
604,78," RML's present price for a share of stock is $ 1,000. As noted at p. 1358 supra, the charge had risen to $ 3,000 per share 
before negotiations directed toward the settlement of this lawsuit began."
604,79," RML has not directly met this argument; rather, it has contended only that the $ 1,000 charge is reasonable. As we point out 
infra, this argument is not responsive to the Government's contention. It is also important to note in this context that, while RML has attempted to show that many of its membership criteria are 
adapted from NAR criteria, it has refused to adopt the NAR's position regarding entrance fees to a multiple listing service. NAR's 
Interpretation No. 29 provides that an entrance fee for participation in a multiple listing service which is in excess of the 
approximate cost, including the accumulation and maintenance of reasonable reserves, of developing, maintaining or improving 
the organization as a going concern, is an inequitable limitation on membership. Exhibit 3 to Deposition of Charles Clark. "
605,80," RML currently charges members for some of the services it renders, such as the distribution of listing books, on the basis of 
the cost of the services to RML. R.697a. The Government does not object to this practice."
605,81," Originally, the Terminal Association's fees were left completely to the owner's discretion. Id. at 511. Later, the by-laws were 
amended to set fees at such a level as to produce only enough revenue to cover fixed charges and operating and maintenance 
expenses. Id. at 512."
605,82, See note 38 supra.
605,83, The Court also required the abolition of certain anticompetitive practices of the association not here relevant. See id. at 516. 
606,84," Contrary to both RML's contention and the district court's finding, limiting the membership fee to the actual cost of admission, 
plus a pro rata contribution toward the maintenance and development of RML, would not undermine the investment of current 
RML members. All members would contribute to preserve the viability of RML under a fee schedule like the one outlined here. 
Members who do not pay a pro rata share of the assets, however, are not entitled to equal distribution of the assets in the event 
of dissolution. Thus, the investment of current members would be protected. See St. Louis Terminal Railroad Ass'n, supra, 32 S. 
Ct. at 511."
606,85, This type of fee schedule is essentially that contemplated by Interpretation No. 29 of the NAR. See note 79 supra.
606,86," Again, assuming that RML has the requisite market power, this rule should be voided on its face. The market power issue is 
open on remand, as we have indicated. Because we conclude that the district court erred in approving RML's stock purchase rule, we do not reach the question whether 
the current $ 1,000 charge is either a ""just and reasonable"" price for an ownership share or a reasonable charge for 
membership. We do note, however, that there is conflicting evidence on these points."
606,87," At one time RML required an 85% affirmative vote for admission. This requirement was later lowered to a simple majority 
before the present admission criteria were adopted. See p. 1358 supra."
606,88," It is undisputed that RML abandoned all these practices under threat of suit by the Government and in order to avoid this 
litigation. After doing so, RML submitted to the district court an affidavit indicating that it had passed a resolution stating that it 
had no intention to resume these practices. The district court relied on this action in holding that these aspects of the case were 
moot. "
622,1," The NASL submitted, as part of its post-trial presentation, a helpful annotated complaint, which cross-referenced the 
allegations of the complaint to the NASL's proposed findings of fact.  The only proposed finding relating to P 45(b) of the 
complaint is No. 99, which reads in its entirety: ""The NFL defendants' prior cross-ownership ban has caused damage to the business and property of the NASL plaintiffs, in an 
amount to be determined at trial, by depriving the NASL and its member clubs of needed infusions of new capital and sports 
entrepreneurial skill, which, in turn, has: ""(a) prevented the market value of NASL franchises from rising to the levels which they would have achieved under normal 
supply and demand conditions; ""(b) resulted in the loss of revenues from reduced fan popularity, attendance and support; ""(c) reduced the current and projected value of NASL television contracts; ""(d) resulted in the loss of revenues from reduced stability and loss of goodwill; and ""(e) imposed substantial additional costs upon the NASL in seeking new sources of sports ownership capital and skill."" It is apparent that this proposed finding relates solely to the cross-ownership ban, and has nothing to do with the additional 
antitrust violations alleged in the complaint."

624,6, Finding No. 8. 
625,7," NFL proposed post-trial Finding of Fact 13, to which the NASL signifies its agreement; appendix 7 to NASL post-trial brief. "
626,8," Even in United States v. National Football League, supra, which the NFL doggedly characterizes as ""wrongly decided"" (pre-
trial brief at 12 n. 2), the district court recognized ""[professional] football is a unique type of business.  Like other professional 
sports which are organized on a league basis it has problems which no other business has."" 116 F. Supp. at 323. In 
consequence, one of the television restrictions, otherwise suspect as an allocation of marketing territories, was permitted to 
stand because the league, ""a truly unique business enterprise,"" was ""entitled to protect its very existence by agreeing to 
reasonable restrictions on its member clubs."" Id. at 326; see discussion supra.  The NFL's primary line of defense in United 
States v. National Football League, decided before Radovich, supra, foreclosed the issue, was that the NFL's activities did not 
affect interstate commerce.  The ""single economic entity"" defense does not appear to have been asserted. Judge Grim upheld 
the restriction in question by resort to the rule of reason. But Judge Grim's analysis may arguably be regarded as an old 
testament prophecy of a new message soon to be preached. "
627,9," With respect, I am bound to say that the second perceived anticompetitive effect is less apparent.  Competition among NFL 
teams for key personnel such as players and coaches is nationwide; quaere whether the presence of two teams in one playing 
area adds an extra dimension to this particular competition.  But the direct competition between such teams for the limited 
amount of leisure time dollars ""in the pockets of sports fans"" in the same playing area cannot be gainsaid, and on my reading of 
the Coliseum opinions furnishes the raison d'etre for the Sherman Act ยง 1 preliminary injunction."
627,10," As noted ante, Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., also cited by the NASL, considered a contract between a single NFL club and a 
wholly independent stadium operator which denied a vital resource (the stadium) to a competing NFL franchise. Concerted 
league activity was not involved; the requisite number of economic actors arose from the NFL club and the stadium operator.  
Hecht is not pertinent to the issue under consideration in the case at bar."
627,11," United States v. National Football League, supra, at 116 F. Supp. 326. "
628,12," I may judicially notice, from the public press, that the NHL Stanley Cup final round's last game was played on May 24, 1980 
over six weeks after the baseball season began on April 9.  NFL pre-season football games were available on television during 
the first week in August.  In 1979, baseball's World Series was not completed until October 17; the Series began this year on "
629,," October 14.  Last year the press featured photographs of baseball commissioner Kuhn, observing the World Series from his field 
box, sans topcoat or sweater in the cold October night, manfully pretending it was not cold.  The NBA has confined itself 
somewhat more closely to what one thinks of as a traditional season, from mid-October to mid-May."
629,13," Finding No. 32.  In recent years, the NASL has extended its play-off season into September, while the NFL commences its 
pre-season televised games in late July or early August."
629,14," See text at fn. 6, 7."

629,17," See Guth affidavit, Ex. 12, citing statistics tabulated by Trends in Performance in Sports Programming, CBG/National 
Television Research, March, 1979. "
634,18," I stress the concept of relevant competition, because as the Los Angeles Coliseum case demonstrates, NFL member clubs 
may compete with each other in the same geographic submarket for a localized benefit: the entertainment dollars in the pockets 
of the sports fans in that area.  Where joint action of the member clubs restrains competition between them and damages an 
outsider, an antitrust claim arises.  That is the essence of Coliseum I and Coliseum II, supra. But the localized inter-club 
competition Judge Pregerson held relevant to the claim of a local stadium operator is irrelevant to competition on a nationwide 
scale, in the stadia or on network television, between two professional leagues. Within that context, the constituent members are 
at one in advancing the interests of their league's joint product, to the economic disadvantage of the product of rival leagues. "
636,19," Cf.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 23, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 1564, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1

the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all."""

667,18," .  Two other circuits, seeking a more flexible approach for judging whether a particular person is the proper party to litigate an 
antitrust claim, have recently adopted a ""zone of interests"" test. See Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Indus., Inc., 552 F.2d 90, 99 
(3d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 823, 98 S. Ct. 69, 54 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977); Cromar Co. v. Nuclear Materials & Equip. Corp., 543 
F.2d 501, 505-08 (3d Cir. 1976); Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1148 (6th Cir. 1975). According to the court in Malamud v. Sinclair Oil, both the direct injury test and the target area test ""demand too much from 
plaintiffs at the pleading stage of the case."" 521 F.2d at 1149. Inspired by the test for standing in administrative law, i. e., 
""whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or 
regulated by the statutory or constitutional guarantee in question,"" the new test recognizes the inadequacy of any one formula 
and instead relies on a case-by-case determination of whether the plaintiff is one whom Congress intended to protect in enacting 
the antitrust laws. As applied by the Third Circuit, each case: (Must) be carefully analyzed in terms of the particular factual matrix presented. In making this factual determination courts must 
look to, among other factors, the nature of the industry in which the alleged antitrust violation exists, the relationship of the 
plaintiff to the alleged violator, and the alleged effect of the antitrust violation upon the plaintiff. Then, while recognizing that 
breaches of the antitrust laws have effects throughout society, a court must decide whether this plaintiff is one ""whose protection 
is the fundamental purpose of the antitrust laws."" Cromar Co. v. Nuclear Materials & Equip. Corp., 543 F.2d at 506. This circuit has not previously commented on the zone of interests approach. See Solinger v. A&M Records, Inc., 586 F.2d 
1304, 1310 n.5 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 908, 99 S. Ct. 1999, 60 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1979). We note with approval, 
however, that the zone of interests approach appears to embody a fundamental concern for the policies underlying the antitrust 
laws and Congress's purpose in creating a private antitrust damage action. That purpose appears to have been twofold: (1) to 
provide a meaningful compensatory remedy for private harm, and (2) to provide effective enforcement and deterrence by 
encouraging private parties to bring some of the suits not brought by the government. See Berger & Bernstein, supra note 15, at 
845-858. We therefore suggest that, in future cases, parties who would be denied standing because they were not ""foreseeable 
victims"" under the traditional target area test should still be permitted to litigate their claims if to do so would further the policies 
underlying the antitrust laws. In the analogous field of tort law, in which a defendant who acts with intent to injure another is liable for unforeseen injury to third 
parties, foreseeability is irrelevant to standing. Since section 4 of the Clayton Act is a remedial statute, designed to compensate 
victims of illegal acts that are inherently intentional rather than negligent, the systematic denial of standing on foreseeability 
grounds may result in the dismissal of actions which would otherwise further both the deterrent and compensation purposes of 
the Act. See footnote 19 infra. "
668,19," .  The seemingly contrary holding of Contreras v. Grower Shipper Vegetable Ass'n of Central California, 484 F.2d 1346 (9th Cir. 
1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 1445, 39 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1974) (per curiam) is distinguishable. In that case 
farmworker employees were denied standing to sue for loss of work due to an alleged grower conspiracy to fix the price of 
iceburg lettuce by limiting production and sale of the lettuce. Loss of work, however, was not the intended result of the alleged 
conspiracy, but only one of its many incidental byproducts. Nor did the farmworkers in Contreras claim to have been totally shut 
out of the service market, as was the alleged intention of the conspiracy in the instant case. See also Gutierrez v. E. & J. Gallo 
Winery Co., 604 F.2d 645 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam). With reference to the discussion of the zone of injury test in footnote 18 supra, we note that Contreras and Gutierrez may be 
good examples of cases in which injury to a certain plaintiff might not have been foreseeable, but where that plaintiff's suit may 
further both the compensatory and deterrent purposes of the antitrust laws. Certainly an alleged conspiracy to limit lettuce 
production artificially could result in injury, whether intended or not, to persons who are highly dependent on that industry. 
Moreover, it may be that the farmworkers are the only persons available to bring suit. Companies whose business interests are 
immediately affected by an antitrust violation may not sue because of their stake in an ongoing commercial relationship with the 
violator. And even if the farmworkers' suit is not necessary to provide a deterrent, because of the availability of other injured 
parties, any fear of a duplicative or windfall recovery may be allayed by apportionment of damages at time of trial. See Berger & 
Bernstein, supra note 15, at 858-883."

671,3," .  In his dissent from this order, Judge Sneed suggests several scenarios of employer behavior that, he says, might constitute 
conduct violative of the antitrust laws as interpreted by the majority. The majority opinion, like the Court's opinion in Connell 
Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975), was not intended to establish a 
comprehensive set of rules governing all imaginable future group conduct by employers. The majority simply holds that 
employers may not be exempt from the antitrust laws when they indulge in conduct directly analogous to the union conduct 
found to be non-exempt in Connell. "
672,1, .  Consider these hypothetical cases:
672,1," . Suppose that one or more, but fewer than a majority, of the members of the multiemployer bargaining unit described in the 
text oppose attempting to destroy the union, but are required to go along with the other employers under the multiemployer 
bargaining unit's charter. Are the dissenting employers subject to antitrust liability?"
672,2," . Members of a multiemployer bargaining unit prefer their employees' representative, union X, to union Y, which is attempting to 
replace union X. Therefore, the employers agree to bargain very easily with union X. May union Y sue the employers under the 
Sherman Act? Would it matter whether the employers unanimously adopted the strategy or some opposed it?"
672,3," . Consider this case, which is similar to the employer activity challenged in Part XXIV(6) of the Complaint, reprinted in the 
dissenting opinion, supra n.1. A multiemployer bargaining unit sponsors a workshop on the law relating to decertification of 
bargaining representatives under section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 159 (1976). Both members of the 
unit and other employers attend the workshop, the goal of which is to reduce union representation. May a union representing 
employees of an employer workshop participant sue under the Sherman Act?"
672,4," . Members of a multiemployer bargaining unit adopt the following strategy for contract negotiations. The members agree to 
bargain to impasse and then impose the terms of their final offer. They further agree that no member of the unit may agree to 
separate terms with the union until the union either accepts the unit's final offer or loses its status as bargaining representative. 
May the union sue under the Sherman Act, even though this agreement is probably an unfair labor practice under section 
8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C. ยง 158(a)(5) (1976), which requires good faith bargaining? "
673,," In the absence of the majority opinion in this case, each of the hypothetical cases would not suggest an antitrust violation. That 
is not now the case. Each is hard to distinguish from this case. Each should be treated as a labor case and the antitrust laws 
should be preempted. "

688,15," Matanuska argues that the interpretation given Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(a)(3), which is virtually identical to Alaska 
Civil Rule 91(c), requires a different result.  Citing United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 58 n.18, 13 L. Ed. 2d 112, 119, 85 S. Ct. 
248 (1964) and Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 27 L. Ed. 2d 580, 91 S. Ct. 534 (1971), Matanuska maintains that 
FRCP 81(a)(3) applies to the issuance of administrative subpoenas and summonses and that Rule 91(c) should be given 
parallel construction.  Powell and Donaldson, however, involved actions initiated by the government to compel production. Other 
cases make it clear that FRCP 81(a)(3) applies only to court action seeking to enforce the investigative demand.  United States 
v. McKay, 372 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir. 1967); Falsone v. United States, 205 F.2d 734, 742 (5th Cir. 1953). "
689,16," It should also be noted that the power to issue investigative demands similar to that authorized in AS 45.52.200-.210 is 
conferred on various administrative agencies by several federal acts including the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 
46(a) and (b)), the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 79(r)), the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 717(m)), and the Federal 
Power Act (16 U.S.C. ยง 825(f)).  The authorizing language in each act is virtually identical: ""For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this chapter, any member of the Commission, or any officer 
thereof designated by it, is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, 
take evidence and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, contracts, agreements, or other records

56 L. Ed. 2d 30, 44-46, 98 S. Ct. 1554 (1978) and United States v. Silberman, 464 F. Supp. 866, 874 n.4 (N.D. Fla. 1979), we do 
not think these decisions are controlling.  Memphis involved action by a utility to terminate service without first allowing its 
customer to challenge his bill.  The Court applied a balancing test which weighed the private interest, the government interest 
and the risk of erroneous deprivation of private rights and concluded that, since utility service is a necessity, the risk of mistaken 
termination is not insubstantial, and alternative procedures are available, the procedure violated due process. Silberman, which relied on Memphis, involved the conviction of a Hare Krishna member for disseminating religious literature and 
thus concerned weighty First Amendment considerations. If anything, we think the test in Memphis supports the State's view since the governmental interest in regulating unfair methods 
of competition is strong while a corporation's interest in the privacy of its business records is correspondingly weak.  United "
692,," States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 94 L. Ed. 401, 70 S. Ct. 357 (1949); Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 
U.S. 186, 90 L. Ed. 614, 66 S. Ct. 494 (1946). Appellants also attempt to show that in several regulatory areas the agency or commission serving an administrative subpoena 
bears the initial burden of instituting action.  In each case cited by appellants, however, the statute under consideration 
specifically provided for enforcement of administrative subpoenas by the courts.  The requirement that the agency initiate action 
was, therefore, of statutory, not constitutional, origin.  Moreover, at least in the case of the federal statutes, such provisions are 
necessary to give the district courts, which are courts of limited jurisdiction, authority to hear such matters.  See Kennecott 
Copper Corp. v. FTC, 542 F.2d 801, 803-04 (10th Cir. 1978)."
692,19," While appellants' petitions to modify or set aside the investigative demands in this case were pending, Arden and Matanuska 
entered pleas of nolo contendere to federal charges involving substantially the same matters as those which provided the basis 
for the investigative demand.  A related federal civil action is still pending. In view of the concluded federal criminal proceedings, the Alaska Attorney General represented to the court in a hearing held 
November 27, 1978, that the State would not seek to proceed criminally against Arden or Matanuska notwithstanding that the 
Alaska Restraint of Trade Act permits the use of investigative demands to seek information which may subsequently be used for 
either civil or criminal proceedings. "

700,2," .  Charming plaintiffs could have requested reconsideration from this Court, particularly since the original order did not address 
the issues raised by Charming plaintiffs; they may have been able to appeal the denial under the collateral order exception to the 
final judgment rule, see Anschul v. Sitmar Cruises, Inc., 544 F.2d 1364 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 272, 50 L.

broad."
700,3," .  Cf.  Folding Cartons, Inc. v. American Can Co., 79 F.R.D. 698, 703-04 (N.D.Ill.1978) (class certification denied where 
representative had participated in deliberately deceptive selling schemes as a competitor of possible class members, where the 
individual who was the principle of the representative had sold substandard material and had deliberately lied, and where there 
had been extensive contacts and business negotiations between the representative and certain defendants). "
702,4," .  Neither party thoroughly briefed the question of the relevance of Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 
2d 707 (1977), to the Charming plaintiffs' suit.  The defendants saw ""no need to distract the Court and parties at this time with a 
debate on plaintiff's standing."" Since plaintiffs considered it a question on the merits of their suit, plaintiffs said the ""effect, if any, 
of Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, on this action need not and indeed should not now be decided โฆ."" The defendants are 
correct, however, in characterizing the question as one of standing.  As such, the impact of Illinois Brick must be addressed at 
this point in the litigation."
702,5," .  Another formulation of the standing requirement of section 4 is the direct injury or proximate cause test.  The Seventh Circuit's 
definition of the target area test seems to partially incorporate the proximate cause test by including the concept of reasonably 
foreseeable injuries.  For a discussion of standing in antitrust cases before Illinois Brick, see In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air 
Pollution, 481 F.2d 122, 125-57 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1045, 94 S. Ct. 551, 38 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1973). "
703,6," .  The Supreme Court's concern over double liability seems to be in conflict with its concern over apportionment. Double liability 
would occur if a defendant supplier illegally increased its prices by Y and its direct purchaser passed that increase on to the 
indirect purchaser; the Illinois Brick decision seems to contemplate that if the indirect purchaser had standing, the direct 
purchasers could recover 3 X Y from the defendants, and then the indirect purchasers could also sue for 3 X Y.  The Supreme 
Court concern about apportionment, however, apparently focused on the difficulties of dividing 3 X Y between the direct 
purchasers and the indirect purchasers and anyone else who may have absorbed some of the illegal raise.  If there was 
apportionment in that manner, there would be no double liability. "
707,*," It is true, as plaintiffs point out, that courts have found labor organizations to exist despite the inclusion of employees in 
categories explicitly excluded by Section 152, such as railway workers and supervisors, but in each of those cases the essential 
employment relationship between the parties was undisputed; the question instead revolved around the legislative policy 
excluding certain categories of employees from union membership in general.  District 2 MEBA v. Amoco Oil Co., 554 F.2d 774

718,2," Under applicable securities regulations, the September 12 offer was to expire on October 9, 1980. Subsequent intervening 
events, which will be more thoroughly discussed infra at p. 419-420 compelled InterNorth to extend its offer to October 31, 1980. 
It has now been extended once again until December 5, 1980. "
719,3," Evidence presented by InterNorth further revealed that the Crouse-Hinds Board of Directors were quite concerned that the 
InterNorth offer put the security of their jobs in jeopardy. The legal implications of this evidence was the subject of the Court's

it was conducted in a short period of time, discovery was indeed extensive. Crouse-Hinds deposed many InterNorth executives

720,8," The Court defined ""product market"" as follows: HN3[
] The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-
elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it. However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets 
may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.  United States v. E. I. duPont deNemours & 
Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593-595 (77 S. Ct. 872, 877, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057). The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by 
examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's 
peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and 
specialized vendors. HN4[
] Because ยง 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits any merger which may substantially lessen competition 
""in any line of commerce"" (emphasis supplied), it is necessary to examine the effects of a merger in each such economically 
significant submarket to determine if there is a reasonable probability that the merger will substantially lessen competition. If 
such a probability is found to exist, the merger is proscribed. (Footnote omitted) Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. at 325, 82 S. Ct. at 1523-24."

regard, evidence indicating the purpose of the merger may be useful in predicting the likely cause of conduct of the parties.  Id., 
370 U.S. at 329 n. 48, 82 S. Ct. at 1526 n. 48. Furthermore, the pre-acquisition anticompetitive conduct of a firm is probative of

721,11," When determining the probable effects of a merger, the Supreme Court has adopted a sliding scale approach depending on 
the nature and purpose of a challenged business practice. Thus, a court need not find that a tying arrangement forecloses a 
""substantial"" dollar amount of commerce because the coerciveness of that practice is inherently anticompetitive and is likely 
""substantially to lessen competition"" in the usual case. As compared with the practice of requirements contracts, however, which 
one more often employed to serve legitimate business needs, a larger foreclosure of commerce may be tolerated where the 
purpose of the contract is reasonable.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. at 329-334, 82 S. Ct. at 1526-1528."

733,74," The authors also believe that reciprocity is readily discoverable because reciprocity leaves a ""trail"" of documentation since 
buying and selling transactions must be correlated. Thus, they say, that a merger raising this possibility of reciprocity is easily 
enjoined after a merger by the authorities should the reciprocity be practiced. Id. at P 1130b. Furthermore, in the Court's view, the question of the form of reciprocity at issue here whether deemed voluntary or coercive, 
adds little to the present discussion due to the fact that the agreement will not be entered into unless it is profitable to both 
parties. "
734,75," As this Court noted in its decision in Carrier Corp. v. United Technologies, this statement of the law of reciprocity is not 
inconsistent with the Second Circuit's decision in Gulf & Western Industries, Inc. v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 476 F.2d 
687 (2d Cir. 1973). The Court in Gulf & Western stated that ""(it) is the third-parties' perception of what course would be to their 
best advantage that may give use to reciprocal dealing by creating a market structure conducive to reciprocity or reciprocity 
effect,"" id. at 694, but the Court did not indicate that it was unnecessary to also show a probability that reciprocity will be 
practiced. Id. at pp. 76,371-72."

proclivity for anticompetitive conduct โฆ."" Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law: Antitrust Issues at p. 46. 
While the Court certainly views such evidence as admissible, see Memorandum-Order, dated October 21, 1980, as proof of a 
defendant's proclivity to violate the antitrust laws. Nevertheless, the very age of the nolo plea and consent decree attenuates its 
significance for present purposes. Moreover, in view of the other proof introduced in this case on the issue of InterNorth's intent, 
the instant proof stands but as a slender reed in a river of proof to the contrary. "

739,89," Plaintiff seeks also to have the Court consider the probability that tying effects would result from the merger. This claim was 
not argued at the hearing on plaintiff's preliminary injunction motion nor has one shread of evidence been offered by plaintiff to 
support this theory. Consequently, the Court will give this argument no further consideration."
739,90," Neither party has requested that the Court consider a sometimes used sixth test for determining an illegal tying arrangement 
whether the seller of the tying product has a direct economic interest in the market of the tied product. See e.g.  Keener v. 
Sizzler Steak Houses, 597 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir. 1979). The Court does note, however, that the defendant's interest in the 
relevant tied products here would satisfy this test."
739,91," InterNorth suggests that a plaintiff in a Section 7 case must make a higher showing of anticompetitive harm due to the 
requirement that a merger ""substantially lessens competition,"" as opposed to the lesser standard or ""not insubstantial"" 
requirement in a Sherman Act or Section 3, Clayton Act case. With qualification the Court disagrees. In Brown Shoe the Court 
held that the extent of foreclosure required to be proven in any antitrust case depends on the ""nature and purpose"" of the 
challenged anticompetitive practice.  370 U.S. at 294, 82 S. Ct. at 1502; see supra, n. 11. Where that practice is ""inherently anti-
competitive,"" then a lesser degree of foreclosure is required than if that practice has potentially redeeming competitive qualities. 
Tying arrangements are to be found in the former category. As the Court stated in Brown Shoe: The usual tying contract forces the customer to take a product or brand he does not necessarily want in order to secure one 
which he does desire. Because such an arrangement is inherently anticompetitive, we have held that its use by an established 
company is likely ""substantially to lessen competition"" although only a relatively small amount of commerce is affected.

would normally be a contract that would extend from date of first production for a period of twenty years, and thereafter, there 
would be a need to obtain permission from the FERC if that sale were to be abandoned. In other words, it is a long-term

744,109," Throughout the mid-seventies the natural gas transmission companies did not have enough gas to supply the requirements 
of the customers. This is true practically throughout the entire industry. There may have been a couple of minor exceptions. An 
instance wherein an industrial customer, for instance, where they were not being supplied by the transmission company 
pursuant to curtailment orders of the FERC, they have various alternatives, one of which was to seek alternative fuel, such as 
fuel oil, or perhaps coal. (Emphasis supplied). Another situation arose wherein the FERC granted such industrial customers of a transmission company to go to the supply 
area, itself, and seek out natural gas and have it transported to their point of need by various transmission companies, one of 
which, of course, would be the transmission company that normally would have supplied the requirements of such customers. Transcript at pp. 296-97."

coercively, retains this right."") In addition, Crouse-Hinds has alleged that the proposed merger will violate Section 8 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 19. Crouse-Hinds claims that if the merger succeeds, one Dr. James Renier will sit on both the Board 
of Directors of InterNorth and Honeywell, Inc., the latter being a competitor of Crouse-Hinds. This fact, in Crouse-Hinds' view, will 
violate Section 8's prohibition against interlocking directorates. In the instance where, as a result of a merger, a director will sit 
on the parent company of a subsidiary that competes with another corporation on whose board that same director sits, a central 
question is to what extent the parent company controls its subsidiary.  Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 584 F.2d 
1195, 1205 (2d Cir. 1978). Plaintiff has offered no proof on this issue, and the record contains proof to the effect that if the 
InterNorth/Crouse-Hinds merger is consummated, Crouse-Hinds will be run as a totally separate and independent corporation.

and describe his attempts to obtain those facts.  The mere averment of exclusive knowledge or control of the facts by the 
moving party is not adequate: the opposing party must show to the best of his ability what facts are within the movant's

] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the 
court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history for the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."
823,30," .  The court went on to state: while the (coercive) practice certainly is the more offensive, (voluntary) arrangements are equally disruptive of the 
competitive processes (Reciprocity) transforms substantial buying power into a weapon for ""denying competitors less 
favorably situated access to the market.' It distorts the focus of the trader by interposing between him and the traditional 
competitive factors of price, quality, and service an irrelevant and alien factor which is destructive of fair and free 
competition on the basis of merit.  The efficient producer may thereby suffer loss because of circumstances extrinsic to the "
824,," worth of his product.  In this situation, it is relative size and conglomeration of business rivals, rather than economic 
efficiency, that may determine firm growth and success, and ultimately, the allocation of resources. United States v. General Dynamics, Corp., 258 F. Supp. at 59. Accord, Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4, 78

862,1," Paragraph 2 of the agreement is set forth above and contains the repayment schedule whereby the franchisee was allowed to 
retain no more than $ 500 per month until the initial period ended.  If Roberts bought equipment from his management 
corporations during that period at inflated prices, as defendants allege, he would divert a larger amount of income to himself as 
sold shareholder of the corporations.  Thus, Elaine Powers would still receive the total amount due but over a longer period of 
time. "
864,2," ""[t]he assessment of the legality of a tying arrangement does not necessarily end with a finding that some or all of the elements 
of a per se violation are absent.  A tying arrangement may nonetheless contravene Sherman ยง 1 under the rule of reason test."" In re Data General Corp. Antitrust Litigation, supra at 1101, citing Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., supra . 
Under the rule of reason test, ""[a]n antitrust claimant who unsuccessfully seeks to establish a per se violation may nonetheless 
prevail by showing that its adversary's conduct unreasonably restrains competition."" Kentucky Fried Chicken v. Diversified 
Packaging , 549 F. 2d 368, 380 (5th Cir. 1977). However, in the case sub judice , plaintiffs base their claims solely on the per se rule, and do not even purport to claim that they 
could establish a violation under the rule of reason test.  Accordingly, if plaintiffs are to prevail it must be under the per se rule, 
and if defendants can demonstrate that plaintiffs cannot establish one or more of the five requisite elements of a per se violation, 
defendants are entitled to judgment on the antitrust claims. "
865,3," According to Betty Gillanders, general manager of Elaine Powers, defendants routinely offered new franchisees the opportunity 
to purchase equipment and other items as part of a turnkey package since most had little prior business experience and 
because they could get into the business without a large capital investment by buying the items from Elaine Powers over a 
period of time.  Decl. of Betty Gillanders at 3, filed March 31, 1977.  HN7[
] While the offer of a turnkey deal will not justify a 
tying arrangement, Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp ., 606 F. 2d 704, 725 (7th Cir. 1979); Northern v. McGraw-Edison Co ., 542 
F. 2d 1336, 1347 (8th Cir. 1976), the mere fact that items are offered to franchisees in a package is not, by itself, evidence that "
866,," the purchases were tied to the franchise, see Robert's Waikiki U-Drive v. Budget Rent-A-Car, Supra at 1207. Roberts has not 
rebutted this explanation as to why he bought the original equipment."
866,4, See paragraph 5 of the termination letters set forth at page 6.
866,5," ""'Of course HN9[
] where the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may 
offer the two items as a unitโฆ.'"" Robert's Waikiki U-Drive v. Budget Rent-A-Car, supra at 1207, quoting Northern Pacific Railway 
v. United States, supra at 518 n. 4. "
867,6," The instant case is thus distinguishable from Hill v. A-T-O, Inc., supra , where the ""defendant admit[ted] to a policy of never 
offering the [tying product] separately from the sale of the [tied] item,"" and where a number of plaintiffs testified that they were 
""forced"" to purchase the tied product.  Id . at 1355. "
868,7," Moreover, the loan was made several years after the decision to designate Gillanders, Inc., as the bookkeeping service to be 
utilized by the franchisees. It would be speculative to infer that Dr. Proctor and the Gillanders agreed to this arrangement 
because the Gillanders would ""loan"" him money in the future.  Thus, it cannot be reasonably inferred that Dr. Proctor was 
motivated by the prospect of the loan at the time he designated the bookkeeping service.  At most, it can be argued that the 
""loan"" was consideration for the continued designation. However, there is no evidence to support such an inference."
868,8," Specifically, Betty Gillanders was employed by E.P. Management, Inc., one of the Elaine Powers corporations.  See Depos. of 
Ken Gillanders at 89, filed December 17, 1979. "
869,9," Plaintiffs urge that there is no explanation as to who received the proceeds upon liquidation.  Presumably, the proceeds were 
distributed to the creditors and shareholders of the corporation.  Plaintiffs have not suggested any contrary distribution, and it 
would be conjecture for the court to assume that the proceeds were somehow otherwise distributed."
869,10," Dr. Proctor has declared that at the time of the merger No. 13 remained in existence only as a corporate shell, and that it was 
included in the merger agreement in the interests of completeness since all the Elaine Powers corporations were merged at that 
time.  See Decl. of Dr. Proctor, filed April 22, 1980. "
870,11," Plaintiffs contend that the factor of ownership/management overlap makes the instant case ""strikingly"" similar to Arthur Murray, 
Inc. v. Reserve Plan , 406 F. 2d 1138 (8th Cir. 1969), wherein the court suggests that not only is common ownership a factor, 
but other interrelationships between the tying seller and the tied seller may create the requisite economic interest for per se 
liability.  However, in Arthur Murray there was not only overlap between ownership of the tied service and management of the 
tying seller; there was also overlap between ownership of the tied service and ownership of the tying seller. Moreover, unlike 
Arthur Murray , Dr. Proctor did not help the Gillanders capitalize or organize their corporate entity, and Dr. Proctor and Elaine 
Powers had no control over the compensation of employees of officers of Gillanders, Inc.  Thus, Arthur Murray is factually 
distinguishable in several ways, and these distinctions illustrate that Arthur Murray involved entities whose interrelationships 
were far more intense than those found in the present case.  The curt thus concludes that the case sub judice is not controlled 
by the ruling of Arthur Murray ."
870,12," The fact that the Gillanders participated in the drafting of the bookkeeping clause is not sufficient, in itself, to establish the 
requisite economic interest. The antitrust laws are not violated every time a franchisor and a supplier agree to designate the 
latter as the franchisees' source of supply.  See, e.g., Keener v. Sizzler Family Steak House , 424 F. Supp. 482 (N.D. Tx. 1977), 
aff'd, 597 F. 2d 453 (5th Cir. 1979). Plaintiffs' reliance on Esposito v. Mr. Softee, Inc ., 1980-1 TRADE CASES P63,089 (E.D.N.Y. 1979), is unavailing.  The rule of 
law enunciated in Esposito is applicable to cases wherein the plaintiff is required to buy a product from a supplier which is 
controlled by, or which controls, the tying seller. See, id.; Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium v. Mangurian , 549 F. 2d 
1029 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 98 S. Ct. 185 (1977). In the case sub judice , there is no evidence which would support a finding 
that Gillanders, Inc., either was controlled by, or controlled, Elaine Powers. "

873,5," ""Malpractices"" include a wide variety of disreputable or destructive practices.  In this case, the term is used to refer to the 
practice of ""rebating,"" whereby freight forwarders secretly collect a percentage of a carrier's fee as a commission for directing the

explained as an aberration.  Sea-Train had served as a marketing agent for another line; when that arrangement was suddenly 
terminated, the company decided to maintain its organization, utilizing its existing vessels, under its own name.  Id. at 34."
874,8," Scaffardi pointed out that rebating, though legal under Italian law, is subject to severe penalty under section 18(b) of the 
Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. ยง 817(b).  Therefore, any participant would be unlikely to testify to his practices for fear of 
prosecution.  See Brief of Intervenors (Except Sea-Land Service, Inc.) at 6-7.  Moreover, since rebating is a form of price 
competition, he pointed out that it is in the carriers' business interest to keep information relating to their rebating practices away 
from their competitors.  J.A. 629-30."

875,10," The court pointed out that the Supreme Court has long recognized "" ""โฆ the legitimate interest of public officials and 
administrative commissions, federal and state, to resist the endeavor to prevent enforcement of statutes in relation to which they 
have official duties.' "" United States v. FMC, supra, slip op. at 15, quoting Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 441-42, 59 S. Ct. 
972, 976, 83 L. Ed. 1385 (1939). The court concluded that the challenged Commission action ""directly and specifically"" 
interfered with this ""legitimate interest,"" id. at 14-15, because the Department is ""charged with the responsibility for enforcing the 
antitrust laws, โฆ (and) but for Commission approval, would proscribe (such) agreements,"" id. at 16 (footnote omitted)."
875,11," The court found that the statutory constraints placed on the Commission's ability to protect anticompetitive agreements from 
prosecution were an attempt by Congress to protect the consumer and shipping interests.  Id. at 17.  It held that the Justice 
Department, ""as public enforcer of the antitrust laws,"" was entitled to represent those interests.  Id. "

seriously wished to advance its ""economically meaningful overtonnaging' argument, it should have offered the necessary facts 
upon which to support this position."" J.A. 552 (Order Adopting Initial Decision).  Situations may arise in which the record does 
not even superficially refute the Department's arguments; then it may be proper to require additional data from the companies 
before requiring the Department to substantiate its own argument.  However, this is not such a case. "
878,*, Sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 293(a).
878,1," The concern here is with standing, not wisdom.  It is not with the incongruities possible when federal agencies bring their 
internecine policy disputes to court; or with the tragicomic spectacle presented to international shippers who must wait while the 
U.S. government sues itself; or with the potential burden on the judicial process when DOJ can drag into court every agency 
order it doesn't like; or with the policy implications when DOJ functions as a supernumerary nanny over the agency charged with 
overseeing international agreements.  That a myopic zeal for enforcement of antitrust laws may produce strange results, 
particularly in areas of foreign trade, has been remarked, however, in the public press.  The Washington Post, May 25, 1980, at 
B-6."
878,2," As recognized in the earlier panel opinion (n. 25), DOJ's participation in the FMC proceeding and its displeasure with the 
outcome did not alone render it ""a party aggrieved"" such as to insure a right to judicial review.  Indeed, DOJ's insistence on its 
right to challenge FMC approvals of conference agreements under ยง 15, founded entirely on its ""responsibility to enforce the 
antitrust laws"", bears no relation to whether it participated below.  Its ""responsibility"" for enforcement would be no less if its 
manner of performing that responsibility involved a failure to participate before the agency. Similarly, DOJ offers no basis for singling out its responsibility for enforcement of the antitrust laws from its responsibilities for 
enforcement of other laws, and no explanation of why its theory here would not equally justify its appeal of every agency 
decision the effect of which on any of its responsibilities it disliked.  Injection of DOJ into other agency operations may or may 
not be appropriate.  It is singularly inappropriate to inject DOJ into our country's international shipping relationships."
878,3, 46 U.S.C. ยง 801 et seq. (1976). 
879,4," 28 U.S.C. ยง 2341 et seq. (1976). Whether DOJ may appeal an agency decision affecting the government's proprietary interests, whether it may participate in an 
appeal to defend an agency decision, and whether it may support a private appellant, are questions simply inapplicable here.  
The sole basis cited for DOJ's standing to appeal is its ""responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws"".  That DOJ may be denied an 
appeal in connection with that responsibility is not fatal.  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution precludes an appeal, 
for example, of an acquittal in a criminal enforcement of the antitrust laws."
879,5," As the majority appreciates, the Hobbs Act states that ""(t)he Attorney General is responsible for and has control of the 
interests of the Government in all court proceedings under this chapter."" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2348 (1976).  Considering that language 
alone, a holding that DOJ has standing here produces an obvious dilemma, in which the Attorney General must simultaneously 
represent the interests of the government (petitioner DOJ) and the interests of the government (respondent FMC) in the same 
suit.  Unless it be said that FMC's ยง 15 agreement approvals serve no governmental interests, DOJ's assertion of standing here 
reduces to the absurd. That the Hobbs Act preserves the right of an agency to participate in all cases, including those in which the Attorney General 
considers the agency in error, contemplates the presence of an interested private party.  It is not, in my view, an authorization for 
the Attorney General to sue the agency, absent the proprietary interest exception found in United States v. ICC, 337 U.S. 426, 
69 S. Ct. 1410, 93 L. Ed. 1451 (1949), discussed infra."

879,7," Dual rate or exclusive patronage systems have an anticompetitive effect because the cargo of contract shippers becomes 
unavailable to nonconference carriers. When shippers sign dual rate contracts, nonconference carriers (like Isbrandtsen) have 
less cargo and may be forced to withdraw from competition. "
880,8," Congress was dealing with international shipping relations.  In granting FMC the authority to approve shipping agreements 
violative of the antitrust laws, it need not have added an explicit statement that DOJ's responsibility to enforce those laws, 
whether directly or by appeal, was thereby rendered inapplicable to those agreements.  There must be room for congressional 
common sense."
880,9," Nowhere in the Shipping Act did Congress refer FMC to DOJ for consideration of antitrust implications in FMC orders.  On the 
contrary, it relied entirely on the expertise of the FMC for approval or disapproval of anti-competitive agreements in the 
international shipping trade.  Having determined that the public interest includes maintenance of an American shipping capacity, 
Congress gave an agency steeped in the history and nuances of ocean shipping the extraordinary authority to approve conduct 
otherwise violative of our antitrust laws. DOJ's effort here is a back-door attempt to undo what Congress did. "
881,10," United States v. Nixon was a special case, involving a Special Prosecutor and a subpoena for evidence in a criminal 
proceeding.  In providing for a Special Prosecutor, Congress clearly contemplated not only the possibility but the certainty that 
he would be pitted against elements of the Executive branch and may have ""to use judicial processes to pursue evidence"", 418 
U.S. at 695 n. 9, 94 S. Ct. at 3101. "
882,11," Though the case is captioned United States of America v. FMC, the true statutory respondent is the United States, not the 
FMC.  28 U.S.C. ยง 2344 (1976). "
904,1," .  Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Since, in 
adjudicating this motion, the district court considered various affidavits submitted by the parties, we will treat the motion as if it 
were a motion for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). "
905,2," .  The directive stated: ""In response to overwhelming demands by the rank and file members of the Union, the leadership of ILA today ordered 
immediate suspension in handling all Russian ships and all Russian cargoes in ports from Maine to Texas and Puerto Rico 
where ILA workers are employed. ""This order is effective across the board on all vessels and all cargoes. Grain and other foods as well as high valued general 
freight. However, any Russian ship now in process of loading or discharging at a waterfront will be worked until completion. ""The reason for this action should be apparent in light of international events that have affected relations between the U. S. & 
Soviet Union. ""However, the decision by the Union leadership was made necessary by the demands of the workers. ""It is their will to refuse to work Russian vessels and Russian cargoes under present conditions of the world. ""People are upset and they refuse to continue the business as usual policy as long as the Russians insist on being international 
bully boys. It is a decision in which the Union leadership concurs."" "
907,3," .  The elusiveness of any attempt to fit aspects of this rather unique case comfortably within the traditional categories of labor 
law is illustrated by the fact that the ""primary dispute"" could just as easily, and perhaps more appropriately, be characterized as 
one between Afghanistan and Russia (or assuming the viewpoint of the ILA, between the Soviet Union and American 
governments). There is no dispute between the ILA and Russia over matters traditionally thought to be the subject of union 
concern. In Madden v. Grain Elevator Workers Local 418, 334 F.2d 1014 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 967, 85 S. Ct. 661, 13 L. 
Ed. 2d 560 (1965) (discussed infra), an American union directed employees of an American grain wholesaler not to load grain 
onto ships owned by a Canadian employer engaged in a dispute with a Canadian union. There was no suggestion of a primary 
dispute or any dispute between the American union and the Canadian shipper, regardless of the fact that the American union 
may have disapproved of the way in which the Canadian employer was treating Canadian union members. In conventional labor 
law analysis, the court found the primary dispute to be between the Canadian employer and the Canadian union, and the 
secondary dispute to be between the American union and the American employer. If the analogy is followed here, the primary "
908,," dispute is between the USSR and Afghanistan, and the secondary dispute between the ILA and persons carrying Russian-made 
goods. "
909,4," .  Contrary to the suggestion in Judge Aldrich's separate opinion, this conclusion is not dependent on the ""result reached."" We 
quite agree that ""either an act of Congress covers a particular dispute or it does not""; in our view, however, section 8(b)(4) 
""covers"" this dispute, and we believe that the scope of the Benz-Mobile line of cases is narrower than the dissent/concurrence 
would have it. We understand our brother to construe the Benz-Mobile line as reflecting a fundamental principle that Board 
jurisdiction exists only where the Board has jurisdiction over the primary dispute. But we think those cases are adequately 
explained on the principle that in a case involving intertwined ""primary"" and ""secondary"" labor disputes, lack of Board jurisdiction 
over the primary dispute will preclude Board jurisdiction over the secondary conduct more particularly where a contrary ruling 
might well suggest an improper interference by the United States in the relationship between foreign employers and laborers. 
We see no need to extend Benz-Mobile beyond this."
909,5," .  Accepting that the boycott sought to protest Soviet aggression, we may still note that this goal of protest was certainly 
furthered by causing Clark and Waterman to cease handling Allied's Russian-made goods and was additionally enhanced by 
Allied's resulting cutback in its trade with the Soviet Union. "
910,6," .  The conclusion might be somewhat different in a situation where identical union conduct could be found to be either protected 
primary activity or unlawful secondary activity depending on the union's objective. For example, in National Woodwork Mfrs. 
Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967), the Court considered whether a union's refusal to handle 
prefabricated goods was a protected effort to preserve the jobs of union members or activity calculated to satisfy the union's 
objectives elsewhere. The Court held that once it was found, by reference to circumstances such as ""the threat of displacement 
by the banned product or services, the history of labor relations between the union and the employers who would be boycotted, 
and the economic personality of the industry,"" id., at 644 n.38, 87 S. Ct. at 1268 n.38, that the union action did serve the 
legitimate purpose of work preservation, the conduct could not be held unlawful simply because it had the ancillary effect of 
diminishing business between the employer and the source of the prefabricated materials. Cf.  NLRB v. Enterprise Ass'n & 
General Pipefitters, Local 638, 429 U.S. 507, 97 S. Ct. 891, 51 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1977) (objective of work preservation will not protect 
pressure leveled against employer with no power to assign work sought). The Court recently faced a similar situation in NLRB v. ILA, 447 U.S. 490, 100 S. Ct. 2305, 65 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1980), which 
involved the ILA's ""Rules on Containers,"" characterized by the Board as a ""hot cargo"" provision and by the union as a ""work 
preservation agreement."" The Court remanded the case to the Board for further consideration, holding that the dispositive issue 
was whether the agreement had the effect of preserving work of the sort performed by ILA members prior to the era of 
containerization, and not whether the agreement would displace work performed by truckers and consolidators after the 
introduction of containerized shipping. In the course of criticizing the Board's treatment of the case, the Court noted that, should 
the agreement be found to preserve work for union members, it would not matter that it also generated secondary effects: ""The effect of work preservation agreements on the employment opportunities of employees not represented by the union, no 
matter how severe, is of course irrelevant to the validity of the agreement so long as the union had no forbidden secondary 
purpose to affect the employment relations of the neutral employer."" Id., 100 S. Ct. at 2315 n.22. In the context in which this statement was made, it reflects nothing more than a reiteration of the 
accepted proposition that a union is entitled to engage in primary activity no matter how severe the incidental effects on neutral 
parties.  National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 627, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 1259, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967). It should be 
noted, moreover, that the Court directed the Board to determine whether the agreement had ""as its objective"" the preservation of 
work traditionally performed by union members by focusing on the ""nature of the work both before and after (containerization)"" i. "
911,," e., an examination of external facts and circumstances. It was nowhere suggested that the union leadership's subjective ""intent"" 
to preserve jobs would save such an agreement that did not, in fact, have the effect of preserving work. The ILA boycott at issue 
here does not have the effect of realizing any protected union goal."
911,7," .  The fact that the ILA did not engage in more extensive forms of coercion e. g., picketing or a total boycott of employers trading 
with Russia or handling Russian cargo does not dictate the conclusion that its limited boycott had no proscribed object. See 
NLRB v. Twin City Carpenters District Council, 422 F.2d 309, 315 (8th Cir. 1970); Local 5, United Ass'n of Journeymen v. NLRB, 
53 L.R.R.M. 2424, 321 F.2d 366, 370 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 921, 84 S. Ct. 266, 11 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1963). "
912,8," .  But cf. the decision of the NLRB in Local 1355, ILA and Ocean Shipping Service, Ltd., 146 NLRB 723 (1964), reversed by the 
Fourth Circuit in NLRB v. ILA, 332 F.2d 992 (4th Cir. 1964), discussed infra."
912,9," .  The district court also characterized the ILA action as ""a primary boycott of Russian goods, with incidental effects upon those 
employers who deal in such goods."" 488 F. Supp. at 531. Clearly this is not the case. The ILA boycott does not differ in this 
regard from innumerable refusals to handle ""hot cargo"" that have been held to be prohibited secondary activity, e. g., NLRB v. 
Local 3, Int'l Bhd. of Electrical Workers, 477 F.2d 260 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1065, 94 S. Ct. 572, 38 L. Ed. 2d 470 
(1973); NLRB v. Wine Workers Union Local 1, 178 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1949); and cases cited at page 1375 supra. These cases 
might likewise have been described as boycotts of a primary employer's ""goods"" with ""incidental effects"" on the secondary 
employers that dealt with the goods. "
913,10," .  In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States government placed certain restrictions on exports to the 
USSR but did not impose any restrictions that would limit the importation of Russian wood products. See generally President's 
Message on the State of the Union, 126 Cong.Rec.H. 20, reprinted in (1980) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 112-13."
913,11," .  We also note that the ILA directive orders all ILA members to ""express themselves"" in a manner that may well be contrary to 
the views of some. See Hampton Roads Shipping Ass'n v. ILA, Civ.No. 80-186-N (E.D.Va. March 1980), slip op. at 10 (""the 
Union's position that its action constitute (sic) only the joint expression of its members' opinionโฆ is neither factually nor legally 
supportable. No evidence of a mandate from the Union's membership has been presented, nor did the Union make any effort to 
notify its members or employees that Union members who wished to work or who did not support this action could ignore the 
Union's order without fear of retaliation."") rev'd on other grounds, 631 F.2d 282 (4th Cir. 1980). Cf.  Abood v. Detroit Board of 
Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 234-36, 97 S. Ct. 1782, 1799-1800, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261 (union may not finance ""expression of political views, 
on behalf of candidates, or toward the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective-
bargaining representative"" through assessments paid by employees who object to advancing such ideas). Whatever the rights of 
individual ILA members to refuse work as an act of conscience an issue we need not decide the ILA directive went considerably 
beyond anything necessary to enable these members to assert such a right. See Truck Drivers & Helpers Local 728, 119 NLRB 
399, 407 (1957) (""what is here involved is not an assertion of individual right by individuals, but rather the formulation and 
enforcement by the Respondent Union as a labor organizationโฆ of a collective policy or program""). See also NLRB v. Local 74,

919,1, The transcript of this conference is being filed with the Clerk of the Court contemporaneously with this Memorandum. 
920,2," It is not necessary here to repeat the reasons why complex antitrust litigation must be brought to a prompt resolution.  The 
reasons have been rehearsed in previous opinions of this Court as well as in statements of numerous commentators.  See, e.g., 
Report to the President and the Attorney General of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures 
(January 22, 1979). "
921,3," Section 5 states that a ""final judgment or decreeโฆ rendered in any civilโฆ proceeding brought byโฆ the United States under the antitrust laws to the 
effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding 
brought by any other party against such defendant under said lawsโฆ, as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree 
would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto; Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgment or decrees 
entered before any testimony has been taken[.]"""
921,4," In the instant case enormous effort and expense have already been incurred and, as a result, the action is ready for trial on a 
relatively streamlined basis."
921,5," One consequence of a postponement would be to defeat the major purpose behind section 5(a): the easing of the litigation 
burden in damage suits by private antitrust plaintiffs by effectively decreasing their required proof and litigation expenses.See 
H.R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1914).  There is a question whether the Court could, with propriety, grant an 
extension the major purpose and effect of which would be the circumvention of this congressional intent. "
956,1," .  Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 provides in part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the

Ohio Revised Code ยง 1331.01 provides: As used in Sections 1331.01 to 1331.14 of the Revised Code: (B) ""Trust' is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by two or more persons for any of the following purposes: (1) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce; (2) To limit or reduce the production, or increase or reduce the price of merchandise or a commodity; (3) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation, sale, or purchase of merchandise, produce, or a 
commodity; (4) To fix at a standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or consumer is in any manner controlled or established, an 
article or commodity of merchandise, produce, or commerce intended for sale, barter, use, or consumption in this state; (5) To make, enter into, execute, or carry out contracts, obligations, or agreements of any kind by which they bind or have 
bound themselves not to sell, dispose of, or transport an article or commodity, or an article of trade, use, merchandise, 
commerce, or consumption below a common standard figure or fixed value, or by which they agree in any manner to keep 
the price of such article, commodity, or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure, or by which they shall in any manner 
establish or settle the price of an article, commodity, or transportation between them or themselves and others, so as 
directly or indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, purchasers, or consumers in the 
sale or transportation of such article or commodity, or by which they agree to pool, combine, or directly or indirectly unite 
any interests which they have connected with the sale or transportation of such article or commodity, that its price might in 
any manner be affected; (6) To refuse to buy from, sell to, or trade with any person because such person appears on a blacklist issued by, or is

capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of 
the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, 
the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. "
957,4," .  While the defendants' major contention focuses on the authority and capacity of the Attorney General, the defendants have 
procedurally sought dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) and Rule 12(b)(1) 
(lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter). The Court wishes to note that the resolution of defendants' question has no bearing on whether the plaintiff's complaint under 
Rule 12(b)(6) alleges sufficient facts to state a claim under federal antitrust law. HN1[
] A Rule 12(b)(6) motion will not be granted ""unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him 
to relief."" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). Also see Westlake v. Lucas, 537 
F.2d 857, 858 (6th Cir. 1976), and 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil ยงยง 1205- 1207, 1215-1224, 1228.  
The defendants have not challenged plaintiff's complaint in this regard. Furthermore, with regard to the Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the defendants do not dispute that this Court will have jurisdiction over the 
subject matter if the Court determines that the Attorney General has the authority to bring this action.  The Court views the 
critical issue here as being one of standing.  In Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1975), the Sixth Circuit 
stated at 1146-47: As a general proposition, the doctrine of standing is one aspect of the broader concept of justiciability. (Citation omitted) * * * 
Justiciability is an analytical approach that has been ""developed to identify appropriate occasions for judicial action, both as a 
matter of defining the limits of the judicial power created by Article III of the Constitution, and as a matter of justifying refusals to 
exercise the power even in cases within the reach of Article III.' (Citations omitted.) * * * Justiciability, then, is a jurisdictional 
concept founded in part upon Article III and in part upon judicial discretion.  (Citation omitted.) * * * Standing is just one of several 
more specific categories derived from the general considerations of justiciability. ""The HN2[
] fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court 
and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.' Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99 (88 S. Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947) 
(1968). Also see, Baxley v. Rutland, 409 F. Supp. 1249 (N.D.Ala.1976). Finally, as part of their Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) motion, defendants have asserted that ""the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction 
over the state antitrust law claims being asserted by the Complaint."" The Court will DEFER consideration of this motion and at 
a later date decide whether plaintiff's state law claims are appropriate matters to be resolved under the Court's pendent 
jurisdiction.  Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's state law claims is DENIED without prejudice. HN3[

] Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15, provides for treble damages and reads: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. HN7[
] Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 26, provides for injunctive relief and in part reads: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws โฆ. "

958,6," .  The defendants have, in the alternative, asked the Court to abstain from deciding this issue until the state courts of Ohio have 
ruled on defendants' position.  The invitation to abstain is declined.  The Court sees this as an inappropriate occasion to invoke 
the abstention doctrine.  See, e.g., State of Florida ex rel. Shevin v. Exxon Corp., 526 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1976). Plaintiff's Rule 
12(b)(6) motion to strike certain new material, which is founded on defendants' proffered abstention argument, thus becomes 
moot and accordingly will be DENIED. "

the attorney general pursuant to section 109.81 of the Revised Code by settlement, or by judgment in any court, shall be 
paid into the state treasury to the credit of the attorney general antitrust special account. The attorney general antitrust 
special account shall be used insofar as funds are available therein for the expenses of the antitrust section.  The expenses 
of the antitrust section in excess of the funds available in the attorney general antitrust special account shall be paid out of 
the regular appropriation to the office of the attorney general. "
960,8," .  In Rockside, the Attorney General, acting on his own initiative, brought suit under O.R.C. ยง 3767.32 of Ohio's general 
nuisance law.  Under that section, it was unlawful to dispose any waste materials in any watercourse or upon its banks unless a 
permit was obtained through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the administrative procedures of O.R.C. Chapter 
6111.  The defendant, Rockside, however, was a solid waste disposal operation licensed and governed exclusively by Ohio's 
Solid Waste Disposal Statute, O.R.C. 3734.01 et seq.  Pursuant to ยง 3734.10 of that statute ""the Attorney General, โฆ upon 
complaint of โฆ the Director of Environmental Protection, โฆ shall prosecute"" for violations of the statute.  Accordingly, the 
defendant challenged the power of the attorney general to initiate the suit, absent a request to do so by the EPA Director.  The 
Ohio Supreme Court agreed, but only after narrowly reading ยง 3734.10 in light of the competing and conflicting statutory 
schemes regulated by the EPA.  See State ex rel. Brown v. Rockside Reclamation, Inc., supra at 81-83, 351 N.E.2d 448. "
964,1," Mid-Am's proposed findings of ultimate facts are grouped under six separate headings.  Paragraphs 1 to 159 are grouped 
under the heading ""Ultimate Facts on Issues of Illegal Boycott;' paragraphs 160 to 195 are grouped under the heading ""Ultimate 
Facts Regarding NFO Membership Agreement as a Tying Arrangement;' paragraphs 196 to 216 are grouped under the heading 
""Ultimate Facts Regarding NFO's Unfair Trade Practices;' paragraphs 217 to 222 are grouped under the heading ""Robinson-
Patman Findings;' paragraphs 223 to 232 are under the heading ""Ultimate Facts of NFO Violation of Missouri Law;' and 
paragraphs 233 to 239 are under the heading ""Ultimate Factual Findings In Support of the Plaintiff's Damages.' Counsel for both sides have followed the grouping pattern established by Mid-Am.  We shall follow the same pattern and follow 
the same numbering of paragraphs as that followed by counsel for convenience of counsel and any appellate review that may 
follow this Court's determination of the case. "
966,2," Paragraph 14 A and paragraphs 14 B through 14 E to immediately follow illustrate how we have and will insert paragraphs in 
our findings of fact from the stipulation of agreed facts (Court Exhibit 1) which NFO either quoted or cited in support of particular 
paragraphs of its proposed findings of fact.  Our finding in paragraph 14 A, for example, is an exact copy of paragraph 37 in 
Court Exhibit 1, cited by NFO to support its proposed finding of fact 22.  Paragraph 14 B, cited to support NFO's finding 14, is 
paragraph 38 of the stipulation.  Paragraph 14 C, 14 D, 14 E, cited to support NFO's findings 23, 23, and 15, respectively, are 
paragraphs 43, 44, and 46, respectively, of the stipulation.  All the paragraph numbers to which a capital letter has been added 
in our remaining findings of fact have a similar source and meaning. "
969,3," NFO denied Mid-Am's proposed findings of ultimate facts as stated in this paragraph 39 and Mid-Am's proposed findings stated 
in the two immediately following paragraphs 40 and 41.  NFO based its denial on the alleged ground that the ""evidence does not 
establish NFO positions or authority of individuals named.' We find and conclude that the ground upon which NFO based its 
objection is not tenable.  We therefore make all three findings in the language proposed by Mid-Am. It should also be noted that NFO further objected to all three of the findings proposed in Mid-Am's paragraphs 39, 40 and 41 on 
the additional ground that those findings are ""irrelevant.' Study of the pages of NFO's post-trial brief and NFO's separate answer 
brief shows that the thrust of NFO's argument in that regard is primarily directed against the weight to be given Mid-Am's 
proposed findings. NFO's objection that what may have occurred at the meetings in 1963 and 1964 is ""irrelevant' is also based 
on the legal premise that the factual data contained in the three findings proposed by Mid-Am are of no legal consequence to the 
determination of this action within the definition of ""relevant evidence,' as stated in Rule 401 of the Rules of Evidence. While we quite agree whith NFO's contention that evidence of NFO's 1963 insistence that it would not sell NFO milk to TCMPA 
unless that co-op executed an NFO Master Contract, standing alone, does not establish an antitrust law violation, we believe 
the orderly way to proceed is to make the findings in the form proposed by Mid-Am so that such findings may be given 
appropriate weight and be considered as part of all the facts and circumstances of the case."
969,4," NFO made the same ""irrelevant' objection to Mid-Am's proposed finding of ultimate fact No. 42 as it made to the findings Mid-
Am proposed in its paragraphs 39, 40 and 41, which we discussed in the preceding footnote.  NFO makes the same ""irrelevant' 
objection to all of Mid-Am's findings as proposed in Mid-Am paragraphs 42 to 67, inclusive, except paragraphs 56 and 57, which 
are admitted without objection, and paragraph 55, which is denied.  The findings proposed by Mid-Am in this group of findings 
relate to detailed circumstances concerning NFO's efforts to obtain NFO Master Contracts from other cooperatives in the years 
1963 and 1964. We shall make the findings in the language proposed by Mid-Am because NFO's objection is based solely on the ground that 
the proposed findings are ""irrelevant.' We do so on the same basis and for the same reasons that we stated in connection with 
NFO's ""irrelevant' objection made to Mid-Am's findings as proposed in paragraphs 39 to 41, inclusive.  We make clear, of 
course, that we to not believe that the factual data contained in those paragraphs establish any antitrust violation or otherwise 
illegal conduct on the part of NFO. "
970,5," NFO's denial of Mid-Am's proposed finding in this paragraph on the alleged ground that ""Rust position with NFO is not 
established by the record' is untenable.  Mid-Am's proposed finding is in the exact language of paragraph 239 of the stipulation.  
We accordingly make the finding as proposed. "
975,6," NFO objects to the relevancy of proposed finding 95 and all findings proposed in Mid-Am's paragraphs 96 to 109, inclusive.  
All the findings proposed by Mid-Am in this group are supported by the cited paragraphs of the stipulation.  We therefore make 
the findings as proposed but we have given the undisputed factual circumstances the weight we believe such findings deserve in 
light of all the other facts and circumstances of the case. "
977,7," Mid-Am initially cited two pages (Tr. 742 743) of the trial testimony of witness Powell and a single page (Tr. 859) of the 
testimony of witness Hackler to support proposed findings of ultimate fact Nos. 117 to 120.  Additional pages of the trial 
transcript were cited in Mid-Am's reply to NFO's denial of all four paragraphs.  The findings proposed by Mid-Am in those three 
paragraphs are not supported by the cited testimony. We have therefore modified the findings proposed by Mid-Am in each of those four paragraphs consistent with all the evidence 
adduced by Mid-Am.  It is to be recognized that the modified findings of fact as made, however, do not significantly add to the 
quantum of Mid-Am's proof. "
981,8," The parties' arguments in their respective briefs about the October, 1970 meeting in John Gage's office and its alleged 
significance contain a good deal of talk about NFO being a ""burr under the saddle' and about NFO's alleged intention ""to destroy 
Mid-Am and pick up the pieces,' as Mid-Am proposed in its finding of ultimate fact as proposed in its paragraph 131.  NFO 
admitted paragraph 1282 of Mid-Am's post-trial proposed findings so that there is no factual dispute about the fact that Shafer 
did say something about NFO's being ""a burr under the saddle.' In paragraphs 1283 and 1285 of its post-trial postponed findings, Mid-Am proposed much milder findings than its ""destroy Mid-
Am and pick up the pieces' finding as proposed in paragraph 131 of its proposed findings of ultimate fact. The findings proposed 
in those paragraphs stated:"
981,1283," .  Powell said to Shafer: ""Gordon, are you going to completely tear down the marketing structure that we have all worked 
so long to build up?' (Tr. 740, 755, 760, Ex. 101, Tr. 970-971, 979-980)"
981,1285," .  Shafer's reply to Powell was: ""That is exactly what we are going to do.  We will tear it down and we can rebuild it the way 
we want.' (Tr. 740, 741, 754, 755, 759, 760, 931, 970-971, 979-980, Ex. 101) Mid-Am also proposed a number of other findings in regard to the October, 1970 meeting in its attempt to strengthen its 
argument that what was said at that meeting would support a finding that NFO intended to and did in fact threaten to ""destroy 
Mid-Am' at that meeting.  Typical of those additional findings as proposed in Mid-Am post-trial proposed findings are the 
following:"
981,2194," .  Gary Hanman, Executive Vice-President of Mid-Am, was present at the meeting at John Gage's office in October, 1970, 
when statements were made by Shafer and Graf of NFO: Hanman took those statements very seriously, as did the other Mid-
Am representatives present.  (Tr. 1369)"
981,2197," .  No other organization had ever told Mid-Am that it was going to tear up Mid-Am and pick up the pieces, other than NFO. 
(Tr. 1394)"
981,2200," .  A reasonable, prudent man would have taken the statements made by Shafer at the Gage office meeting seriously."
981,2213," .  The statements made at the office of John Gage in October, 1970 by NFO representatives to Mid-Am representatives 
""unless you sign our contract we will break up Mid-Am and pick up the pieces' are evidence of predatory intent if the threats 
could be taken seriously.  (Tr. 1343-1344) We find and conclude that Shafer's apparent agreement with Powell's suggestion that the market structure might be torn down 
and that NFO would rebuild that market structure could not have been reasonably considered as a threat.  In short, we find that 
NFO's denial of Mid-Am's proposed findings in paragraphs 2194, 2197, 2000, and 2213 is consistent with our view that Mid-Am 
did not carry the burden of proof in regard to those and similar proposed findings. "
992,9," NFO's admission is qualified by its statement that NFO denies that it ""was marketing within the meaning of Form 990.' "
997,10, See also paragraphs 212 to 215 of the stipulation of facts. Those paragraphs provide:
997,212," .  During the period 1962 through ยง 967, NFO personnel encouraged NFO members, who were also members of dairy 
cooperatives, to be active in the affairs of their cooperatives including running for elective office in the cooperative."
997,213," .  During the period 1962 through 1967, some NFO personnel encouraged NFO members in seeking election to dairy 
cooperative boards to encourage those boards to sign Master Contracts with NFO."
997,214," .  During the period 1962 through 1967, some NFO personnel encouraged NFO members to support candidates for election 
to the Board of Directors of dairy cooperatives who were also NFO members."
997,215," .  During the period 1962 through 1967, the concept of having NFO members elected to dairy co-op Boards of Directors for 
the purpose of encouraging those cooperatives to sign Master Contracts was a matter discussed by NFO Dairy Department 
personnel. Those additional stipulated factual circumstances are inconsistent with the notion that NFO's single goal was to eliminate all 
existing cooperatives. "
998,11," Mid-Am's proposed conclusions of law 25-8 and 26-9 were submitted in exactly the same language, which stated: ""25-8 and 
26-9.  The activities of NFO, its members and employees in inducing dairy farmers to withhold their milk from predecessors of 
Mid-Am during the 1967 Milk Holding Action constituted a concerted group boycott.' Our discussion of Mid-Am's conclusions of law 25-6 and 25-7 is applicable to Mid-Am's 25-8 and 26-9."
998,12, Mid-Am's proposed conclusions of law 25-5 and 26-15 repetitiously state that: 
999,25," -5.  The activities of NFO, its members, and employees in attempting to induce predecessors of Mid-Am to sign NFO Master 
Contracts by the 1967 Milk Holding Action constituted a concerted group boycott designed to force, persuade, or coerce 
predecessors of Mid-Am to accede to trade practices desired by NFO, that is, to sign an NFO Master Contract."
999,26," -15.  The means used by NFO to induce or attempt to induce predecessors of Mid-Am to sign NFO Master Contracts during 
the 1967 Holding Action, included withholding of milk, threats of withholding of milk, threats of withdrawal of milk from 
cooperatives which refused to sign, intimidation, force and coercion. Our discussion of Mid-Am's conclusion of law 26-12 in the text is applicable to Mid-Am's 25-5 and 26-15."
999,13," Mid-Am's separately proposed conclusions of law 26-10 and 26-11 duplicate Mid-Am's 28-19.  What we say in the text about 
28-19 is applicable to 26-10 and 26-11 which state:"
999,26," -10.  The activities of NFO, its members and employees in persuading, forcing, or coercing dairy farmers not to perform their 
marketing contracts with predecessors of Mid-Am during the 1967 Milk Holding Action constituted a concerted group boycott."
999,26," -11.  The activities of NFO, its members and employees in inducing dairy farmers to refuse to have normal business relations 
with predecessors of Mid-Am during the 1967 Milk Holding Action constituted a concerted group boycott. "
1000,14," Mid-Am's proposed conclusions 28-23 and 28-24 incorporated and assumed factual data concerning one of Mid-Am's 
predecessors. Those two proposed conclusions of law stated:"
1000,28," -23.  At least one cooperatives [sic] which is now part of Mid-Am, Fergus Dairy Cooperative, signed an NFO Supply Contract."
1000,28," -24.  Fergus Dairy Cooperative signed an NFO Supply Contract involuntarily, as a result of threats and actual loss of milk 
before signing an NFO Supply Contract. We find and conclude that Mid-Am's evidence does not support a conclusion of law that assumes that any NFO Supply Contract 
that Fergus Dairy Cooperative may have signed was in fact signed involuntarily as a result of any illegal threat."
1000,15," One additional conclusion of law proposed by Mid-Am, 28-25, related to ""action taken by NFO which affected Mid-Am.' That 
proposed conclusion related to Mid-Am's legal position in regard to NFO's alleged exemption under the Capper-Volstead Act 
and stated: ""28-25.  Action taken by NFO which affected Mid-Am, or its predecessors, which were undertaken by NFO to force 
Mid-Am to sign an NFO Supply Contract are not immune from the Sherman Act.' We will discuss NFO's exemption claim in a later part of this memorandum opinion in which we state our general agreement 
with Mid-Am's view of the Capper-Volstead Act exemption. "
1001,16," Mid-Am's proposed conclusions 28-20 and 28-26 reiterate the factual untenable claim that the NFO Supply Contracts were 
""illegal price fixing agreements.' Those two proposed conclusions, both of which we reject on factual grounds, stated:"
1001,28," -20.  The NFO Supply Contracts were agreements which actually fixed an agreed price to be paid to NFO members, and 
were therefore illegal price-fixing agreements."
1001,28," -26.  The fact that few NFO Supply Contracts were signed or activated or were only partially effective when activated has no 
bearing upon whether these contracts were illegal price fixing agreements. "
1002,17," NFO proposed four other Capper-Volstead conclusions of law in connection with various aspects of Mid-Am's claims relating 
to the alleged illegal boycott which read as follows:"
1002,5," .  Each contract, combination, or conspiracy that Mid-Am attributes to NFO, its members, officers, directors, and employees, 
including any that sets the price NFO members would be paid for their milk, is exempted from Section 1 of the Sherman Act by 
the Capper-Volstead Act and Section 6 of the Clayton Act."
1002,7," .  In the absence of proof that a contract, combination, or conspiracy with non-farmers was involved, the efforts of one 
agricultural marketing organization to become exclusive bargaining agent for the members of another agricultural marketing 
organization do not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, being exempted therefrom by the Capper-Volstead Act."
1002,12," .  NFO's solicitation of Mid-Am members to ship through NFO, when engaged in solely by NFO and its members and 
employees, is within the antitrust exemption afforded by the Capper-Volstead Act and Section 6 of the Clayton Act. "
1003,15," .  NFO's 1967 milk holding action, including its members' withholding of milk from the market and their recruitment of 
additional farmers to join NFO and participate in the holding action, was activity protected by the Capper-Volstead Act and hence 
exempt from Section 1 of the Sherman Act. What we say about NFO's proposed conclusions Nos. 1 and 2 is applicable to the conclusions proposed by NFO set forth in this 
footnote."
1003,18," The Ninth Circuit's conclusion in that regard was brushed aside with the statement in footnote 6 of Sunkist II that ""non-grower 
participation in Sunkist was not pointed out nor was the issue raised in that [Sunkist I] case; indeed, it was conceded by the 
respondents there that Sunkist was a Capper-Volstead cooperative.'"
1003,19," Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion stated: ""I agree that since several of NBMA's members were not engaged in the 
production of agriculture as farmers, Case- Swayne v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 389 U.S. 384, 88 S. Ct. 528, 19 L. Ed. 2d 621 
(1967), compels the holding that NBMA's activities challenged by the United States cannot be afforded the Sherman Act 
exemption NBMA asserts.' 436 U.S. at 829, 98 S. Ct. at 2130 2131. "
1005,20," Mid-Am proposed seven separate conclusions of law in connection with its tying arrangement claim.  We have numbered the 
separate paragraphs as they appear on pages 38 and 39 of Mid-Am's proposed conclusions of law. Those paragraphs stated 
the following:"
1005,38," -1.  The NFO membership agreement clearly represents a tying contract because of economic power in the tying product, 
and a not insubstantial amount of commerce in the tied product."
1005,38," -2.  Under the stipulated facts this Court finds and concludes that NFO does have economic power in the commodities of 
grain and livestock sufficient to establish the first criteria of a tying contract, and that the number of dairy producers participating 
in NFO programs on a nationwide basis is sufficient evidence of a not insubstantial amount of commerce being affected by the 
NFO Membership Agreement."
1005,38, -3.  Sherman 1 (15 U.S.C. 1) prohibits tying arrangements involving services.
1005,38," -4.  For a farmer to obtain the NFO services of bargaining in either grain or livestock (or both), that farmer must sign the NFO 
Membership Agreement which authorizes NFO to be his exclusive marketing agent for all commodities which includes milk; the 
NFO collective bargaining service in grain or livestock is a tying service, and the NFO marketing function in dairy is a tied 
service, and the Membership Agreements is a tying arrangement, in per se violation of Sherman 1 (15 U.S.C. 1)."
1005,38," -5.  NFO has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product (NFO collective bargaining service in grain or 
livestock) to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product (NFO marketing function in dairy) and a 
sufficiently substantial amount of interstate commerce is affected in the tied product; therefore, the NFO tying arrangement 
constitutes a per se violation of Sherman 1 (15 U.S.C. 1). "
1006,39," -6.  Tying arrangements because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue, are conclusively 
presumed to be unreasonable without necessitating any inquiry as to the effect on the market, or the business reason for their 
use and are per se in violation of Sherman 1 (15 U.S.C. 1)."
1006,39," -7.  NFO's bargaining services in grain and livestock are different from its marketing service in milk, for the purposes of 
applying the elements of a per se violation of Sherman 1 (15 U.S.C. 1); which require a ""tying' service and a different ""tied' 
service. While the conclusions of law proposed by Mid-Am in paragraphs 38-3 and 39-6 may accurately state abstract principles of law, 
we refuse to make those proposed conclusions of law or the other conclusions of law proposed in the other tying arrangements 
paragraphs quoted in this footnote because of Mid-Am's failure to carry the burden of proof imposed on it by applicable law."
1006,21," Article I of the NFO membership agreement authorizes NFO to act for the member ""as my exclusive representative in 
collective bargaining in respect to all commodities marketed from my farm.' An exception, however, was created in that article for 
""those commodities presently covered by other marketing contracts.' Article VII, Section 1 and Article XII, Section 3, provide, 
respectively, that an NFO member was ""free to market his commodity as he chooses' until certain contracts or marketing 
procedures were established and that the NFO member could request a waiver from his area bargaining committee for matters 
""unforeseen seen at the time of signing of this agreement.' "
1008,22," The conclusions of law proposed by Mid-Am in regard to NFO's alleged unfair trade practices, which we expressly reject, are 
as follows:"
1008,43," -1.  NFO, its employees and co-conspirators, engaged in unfair trade practices with the purpose of eliminating Mid-Am from 
the market of representing Mid-Am's members."
1008,43," -2.  NFO's unfair trade practices included the withholding of milk from Mid-Am and its predecessors, threats to withhold milk 
from Mid-Am and its predecessors, solicitation of members of Mid-Am and its predecessors to become NFO members, picketing 
of processors who purchased milk through Mid-Am and its predecessors, and threats to destroy Mid-Am and its predecessors."
1008,43," -3.  NFO violated federal antitrust, securities, and tax laws and supplied false information to the United States Department of 
Agriculture in moving into the marketing of milk in competition with Mid-Am."
1008,43," -4.  NFO violated state anti-price discrimination statutes, securities laws, and non-solicitation laws in moving into the 
marketing of milk in competition with Mid-Am."
1008,43," -5.  NFO knew, or should have known, that if Mid-Am signed an NFO Supply Contract which called for higher milk prices to 
be paid to NFO members than to non-NFO members, all of Mid-Am's members would join NFO, thus effectively eliminating Mid-
Am from the market of representing its members."
1008,43," -6.  NFO, its employees and co-conspirators intended, by their unfair trade practices, to eliminate Mid-Am from the market of 
representing Mid-Am's members."
1008,43," -7.  The willful submission of false information by NFO and its agents and employees to the U.S.D.A. to obtain qualification 
from the U.S.D.A. so that NFO could, through unfair methods, obtain a competitive advantage over Mid-Am and the conduct of 
NFO such as soliciting breaches of contract in violation of state laws, violating federal and state securities law, 
misrepresentations to IRS and violations of the income tax laws, in an effort to restrain competition, fix prices, and allocate 
markets and to eliminate Mid-America from the market of representing fluid milk producers, constituted a violation of Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act, "
1009,23," The conclusions of law proposed by Mid-Am in regard to Mid-Am's Robinson-Patman claim, which we expressly reject, are 
as follows:"
1009,45," -1.  NFO's Milk Supply Contracts require payment of a commission to NFO in connection with the sale of milk by NFO 
members in violation of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1009,45," -2.  NFO is a person within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act which forbids the receipt by a ""person' in 
the course of commerce of a commission in connection with the sale of goods."
1009,46," -3.  The payments of purchasers of milk under NFO Milk Supply Contracts were payments made in the course of NFO's 
commerce, within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1009,46," -4.  Payments to the NFO by the purchasers under the NFO Milk Supply Contracts were payments which violated Section 
2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1009,46," -5.  Under the NFO Milk Supply Contracts, the NFO received a payment from the other party to Milk Supply Contracts, which 
payment was in violation of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1009,46," -6.  The NFO Milk Supply Contracts required that a commission be paid by the purchaser of milk to the seller over and above 
the payment of the base price for the milk itself, in violation of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act. "
1010,46," -7.  The sale of milk by NFO pursuant to the NFO Milk Supply Contracts was a sale of goods, wares or merchandise within 
the purview of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1010,46," -8.  The amount of the commission required by any particular NFO Milk Supply Contract to be paid to NFO was negotiated, 
thus, the commission was discriminatory in violation of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1010,46," -9.  NFO provided no actual services in exchange for receiving a ""commission' pursuant to its Milk Supply Contracts; thus, 
those contracts violated Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1010,46," -10.  The NFO Milk Supply Contracts violate Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act, and, therefore, all acts which were 
taken by NFO to force Mid-Am to sign such an illegal contract are beyond any antitrust exemption."
1010,47," -11.  NFO signed NFO Supply Contracts, as agent for its members, which required the purchaser of milk to pay an additional 
fee to the NFO Dairy Trust; such fees were brokerage, commission or ""other compensation' paid to the agent of the members by 
the purchasers of the NFO members' milk in violation of Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1010,24," Mo.Rev.Stat.  ยง 274.260 provides, in pertinent part, that: "

1011,25," Interestingly enough, those state statutes were passed as part of a movement to ""save the farmer,' which followed in the 
wake of the agricultural depression which followed World War I.  The Court further noted in Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers

legislative movement designed to enable an agricultural producer to obtain a fair price for his products. "
1012,26, Mid-Am proposed the following conclusion of law on damages: 
1013,51," -1.  Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., having been injured in its business and property within the meaning of Section 4 of the 
Clayton (Act (15 USC 15) by virtue of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USC 1) of defendant National Farmers 
Organization, is entitled to judgment in the amount of $ 1,989,350.00 single damages, to be trebled, to the amount of $ 
5,968,050.00 and for reasonable attorneys' fees and its costs incurred herein. NFO proposed the following conclusion of law on damages:"
1013,46," .  None of the damages claimed by Mid-Am are recoverable under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, since they are all ""designed 
to provide [Mid-Am] with the profits [it] would have realized had competition been reduced,' within the meaning of Brunswick 
Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)."
1013,27," NFO's proposed findings of fact 2018 to 2062, inclusive, contained in part XI of its proposed findings and entitled ""Beatrice 
Fort Worth Damages,' claims damages in the amount of $ 151,135.02. NFO's proposed findings of fact 2063 to 2065, inclusive, 
contained in part XII of its proposed findings and entitled ""Pressure Pooling Damages,' claims damages in the amount of $ 
137,786.74.  NFO's proposed findings of fact 2066 to 2080, inclusive, contained in part XIII of its proposed findings and entitled 
""Chicago Damages,' claims damages in the amount of $ 924,248.00.  NFO's proposed findings of fact 2098 to 2488, inclusive, 
contained in part XV of its proposed findings and entitled ""NFO Lost Penetration Damages,' claims damages in the amount of at 
least $ 12,850.899.00.* NFO thus claimed total damages in the amount of $ 14,064,068.76.  NFO also proposed in its conclusion 
of law No. 21 a claim for additional damages by requesting a finding that NFO ""is entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs of 
defending against defendants bad faith litigation.'"
1013,*," Part XIV of NFO's proposed findings of fact, containing paragraphs 2081 to 2097, inclusive, and entitled ""NFO's Customers and 
Market Penetration,' does not contain any proposed finding claiming any particular amount of damages.  The purpose of the 
proposed findings contained in that part of NFO's proposed findings reflected NFO's attempt to support the alleged 
reasonableness of its damage estimates. "
1020,*, Computation does not include adjustment for location differentials applicable under the provisions of the Federal Orders.
1020,28," The use of ""[Rejected]' in regard to paragraph 97 above and in regard to many, many of the paragraphs of findings of fact 
proposed by NFO reflect an explicit finding and conclusion that NFO failed to prove the particular finding of fact proposed and 
that the weight of all the evidence adduced in the case is likewise insufficient to support the particular finding proposed by NFO. "
1021,," While we have modified, and as modified have made many of the findings proposed, we have keyed our findings to the 
paragraph numbers of the findings proposed by the parties so that an appellate court will understand the significance of our use 
of ""[Rejected]' in regard to a particular proposed finding. In Phase I of this case we stated in some detail why particular paragraphs of findings proposed by Mid-Am in support of its 
claim against NFO were rejected.  It must, however, be noted that in Phase I we were required to deal with only a total 239 
paragraphs of proposed findings by Mid-Am and that we had the benefit of exemplary cooperation of the parties which produced 
a stipulation of 3,247 paragraphs of agreed facts.  NFO's Phase I responses to Mid-Am's proposed findings further reduced the 
area of disputed fact. In Phase II and in Phase III of this case we were required to consider literally thousands upon thousands of paragraphs of 
proposed findings of fact and to work with a record which shows that the parties were not as successful in reducing the area of 
disputed factual data either by stipulation or by their responses to proposed findings as they were in Phase I. It is apparent that it simply was not practicable to spell out the rationale of our rejection of proposed findings in Phase II and 
Phase III in the same manner as we were able to do in Phase I.  We would have liked to have been able to have done so for the 
benefit of any appellate court which may be required to review our findings of fact under Rule 52(a) but we believe that obvious 
limitations of time and the production of an even longer memorandum opinion made such a procedure impracticable for Phase II 
and Phase III. "

that plaintiffs could meet the test of Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975), the predecessor statute of 
12 U.S.C. ยง 93, which prescribed the actions that the Comptroller could take for violations of the National Bank Act, was 
construed by the Supreme court to give a private cause of action to a stockholder who suffered injury by relying on false bank 
reports.  Chesbrough v. Woodworth, 244 U.S. 72, 76-77, 37 S. Ct. 579, 581-82, 61 L. Ed. 1000 (1916). In Harmsen v. Smith, 542

penalties and remedies available to the Comptroller of the Currency for violations of the National Bank Act, including ยง 92a(a), 
can also be the basis for a private right of action.  See also Seiden v. Butcher, 443 F. Supp. 384 (S.D.N.Y.1978). "
1067,1," At the time of oral argument, Richard S. Cohen, Attorney General, was the named defendant.  Since that time Mr. Cohen's 
term of office has expired and James Tierney has been elected Attorney General.  Pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1) we have 
made the appropriate change in the caption of this action. "

features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories not desired or requested by the purchaser; provided, however, that 
this prohibition shall not apply as to special features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories which are already 
installed on the car when received by the dealer; provided further, that the motor vehicle dealer prior to the consummation 
of the purchase reveals to the purchaser the substance of this paragraph."
1068,3," The ""assurances of discontinuance"" have been impounded, the effect of which is to keep secret the names of the two dealers 
who signed these agreements.  We are unaware of any statutory authority for such impoundment. Although under appropriate 
circumstances a court may impound records when publication would impede the administration of justice, see, e.g., M.R.Crim.P. 
6(e), the power of impoundment should be exercised with extreme care and only upon the clearest showing of necessity. "
1069,4, The agreed statement of facts states:
1069,1, .  Some new car dealers add extras to all unsold and unordered new vehicles upon arrival at their dealerships.
1069,2, .  Some other new car dealers add extras to some unsold new vehicles on arrival at their dealerships.
1069,3," .  These extras may include rustproofing, exterior paint polish, body side moulding, pin stripes, sunroofs, radios, mirrors, 
tires, and others."
1069,4, .  (a) Dealer added rustproofing costs consumers between $ 150.00 and $ 189.00. (b) Dealer added exterior paint polish costs consumers between $ 150.00 and $ 175.00. (c) Dealer added body side moulding costs consumers between $ 42.00 and $ 59.00. (d) Dealer added pin stripes cost consumers between $ 33.00 and $ 149.00. (e) Dealer added sunroofs cost consumers between $ 250.00 and $ 900.00. (f) Dealer added radios cost consumers between $ 130.00 and $ 222.00. (g) Dealer added mirrors cost consumers between $ 15.00 and $ 65.00. (h) Dealer added tires cost consumers between $ 125.00 and $ 175.00. (i) Dealer added air conditioning.
1069,5," .  Some dealers often add a ""package"" of extras to some unsold and unordered new vehicles upon arrival at their 
[dealerships] which ""package"" includes several different extras and which ""package"" costs consumers $ 250.00 to $ 
750.00, and in some instances more."
1069,6, .  Some dealers will not order certain makes or models of new cars without rustproofing and paint finish.
1069,7," .  In some instances, consumers who wish to purchase a particular make or model new car without any extras must place 
an order and may wait eight (8) weeks or more."
1069,8, .  Some small fuel efficient cars are in high demand at the present time.
1069,9, .  The waiting period for small fuel efficient cars in high demand is longer than the waiting period for other models.
1069,10," .  Consumers who cannot wait or do not want to wait to order a new vehicle often will buy a new car with dealer added 
extras [or a package] of extras, regardless of whether they want or need the extras."
1069,11, .  The addition of extras or packages of extras to new cars increases the [dealers'] profit on the sale of the new cars.
1069,12," .  Many businesses other than new car dealers sell and install extras.  For example, bodyshops and rustproofing 
businesses sell and install extras."
1069,13, .  Businesses [that] sell extras are in direct competition with new car dealers who sell extras.
1069,14," .  In some instances consumers have been told by sales personnel that the [dealerships] automatically add rustproofing 
to all new cars. "
1070,5," We are not certain what is meant by the term ""extra."" As we understand the argument of the Attorney General, if a dealer has 
two identical cars on his showroom floor, except that one has a dealer-ordered, factory-installed automatic transmission and the 
other has a standard transmission, the customer has a right to insist on purchasing the car with the automatic transmission and 
have the dealer absorb the cost of that ""extra"" because the customer asserts that he wants that particular car but with the less 
expensive standard transmission. "
1072,*," Circuit Judge Leventhal, a member of the panel which heard oral argument in this case, died before the case was decided. "
1073,1," HN1[

1073,2," Judge Leventhal who had participated in the hearing also died in this intervening period between oral argument and passage 
of the Act. "
1075,3," It better serves the general interest of the administration of justice if the court limits its resources to the determination of those 
questions and cases that must be decided, especially in view of the ever-mounting docket that besets this and other appellate 
courts. United States v. Hooper, 139 U.S. App. D.C. 171, 432 F.2d 604, 606 (D.C.Cir.1970). "
1084,1," .  The opinion of the Court states: Respondents assert that the stuffing and stripping reserved for the ILA by the Rules is functionally equivalent to their former 
work of handling break-bulk cargo at the pier. Petitioners-intervenors, on the other hand, argue that containerization has worked 
such fundamental changes in the industry that the work formerly done at the pier by both longshoremen and employees of motor 
carriers has been completely eliminated. These questions are not appropriate for initial consideration by reviewing courts. They are properly raised before the Board, 
whose determinations are, of course, entitled to deference. Since the Board has not had an opportunity to consider these 
questions in relation to a proper understanding of the work at issue, we will not address them here. We emphasize that neither 
our decision nor that of the Court of Appeals implies that the result of the Board's reconsideration of this case is foreordainedโฆ. If the Board finds, on remand, that the Rules have a lawful work preservation objective, it will then, of course, be obliged to 
consider the charging parties' contention that CONASA (Council of North Atlantic Shipping Associations) members did not have 
the right to control the stuffing and stripping of containers. Because the Board held that the agreement was directed at work 
acquisition, rather than work preservation, it did not decide the right to control issue in this case. That issue remains open on 
remand. Therefore, and because the arguments of the parties were necessarily addressed to an erroneous conception of the 
work whose control was disputed, any discussion of that issue here would be premature. Petitioners have also argued that the 
employers, as common carriers who are subject to government regulation and to the provisions of their own tariffs, shippers' bills 
of lading, and intermodal interchange agreements with motor carriers, have no legal right to withhold containers or container 
services from their customers on a selective basis, to condition access to the containers on compliance with the Rules, to seek 
indemnification from their customers for fines imposed under the Rules, or to enforce the Rules after the containers have been 
released to motor carriersโฆ. These contentions present difficult and complex problems which are not properly before us."

network makes its profit by selling commercial time to national advertisers.  (Def's Summary Judgment Memorandum, at 5.) "
1095,2," Although not resting its decision on such distinction, the court has serious doubt that NBC is in the market for co-op services at 
all but rather is merely a purchaser of services from Ms. Wohlers, plaintiff's true competitor. "
1096,3," The court has some concern whether information available to a party before a case is taken under submission, in this case the 
December filing of the copyright assignment, should be allowed into the record after the matter is submitted.  However, 
defendant took the opportunity to reply to the filing and raised no objection."
1096,4," Additionally, Mr. McGee states by way of declaration that he intended to assign the right to bring suit on accrued causes of 
action at the time he transferred BMC's assets to plaintiff.  A number of such attempts were made during the course of this 
action and although abortive, do tend to show the alleged intent. Defendant argues that McGee was well-versed in basic rules of copyright law and would have expressly assigned accrued 
causes of action had that been his true intent.  Although there is some evidence of Mr. McGee's familiarity with copyright law, the 
court is willing to accept Mr. McGee's representations for the purpose of this motion.  Furthermore, even if McGee did not intend 
such an assignment prior to suit, as discussed below defendant is not prejudiced by allowing the copyright infringement claim to 
go forward. "
1097,5," One of the few written indications of the meaning of ยง 205(d) is found in 37 C.F.R. ยง 201.4(c) (1980).  The Copyright Office is 
instructed to accept for recordation ""any transfer of copyright ownership (including any instrument of conveyance, or note or 
memorandum of the transfer) โฆ."" Such wording suggests that the phrase ""instrument of transfer"" is to be interpreted broadly."
1097,6," Section 13 of the Copyright Act of 1909 as amended contained registration provisions similar to section 411 of the 1976 Act.  It 
provided in pertinent part: ""No action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in any work until the 
provisions of this title with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with."" 
(Emphasis added).  The 1909 Act also contained recordation of assignment provisions but none comparable to subsection 
205(d) requiring recordation prior to institution of suit. "

1098,8," Even assuming ยง 17044 were to apply, plaintiff would need to demonstrate that defendant NBC had an intent to injure its 
competitors or destroy its competition.  Dooley's Hardware Mart v. Food Giant Markets, Inc., 21 Cal.App.3d 513, 98 Cal.Rptr. 
543 (1971). As discussed below, plaintiff has failed to meet its burden on this issue. "
1099,9," Plaintiff submits a letter dated June 1977 from KNBC-TV cancelling its subscription with Co-opportunities. This evidence falls 
short of that required to defeat summary judgment on the issue of injury.  Besides the fact that KNBC is not a radio station, there 
is no indication of the reason for the cancellation and there is contrary evidence that this station was not receiving NBC's service 
for most of the relevant time period. "

the acquisition. 476 F.2d at 697."
1108,5," .  This conclusion can be reconciled with the finding that the offeror did not misrepresent the purpose of the offer, see p. 121, 
supra, on the ground that ยง 7 requires the Court to anticipate future developments, whereas the issue under ยง 14(e) must be 
decided on the basis of the evidence in the record as to the offeror's current intentions. "
1109,6," .  While C F & I might be a ""perceived potential entrant"" in the coupling market, the market is not sufficiently concentrated to 
enjoin the acquisition simply because it eliminates a source of potential competition.  The Supreme Court has applied the 
""potential entrant"" doctrine only to markets that are already highly concentrated, see United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 
Inc., 418 U.S. 602, 630-31, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 2874-75, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974). The four largest producers of API couplings 
account for 64% of the total production, and thus the market is not highly concentrated.  See Department of Justice Merger 
Guidelines (""Merger Guidelines"") in 3 Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation para. App. 1C-109 (1980).  
Moreover, the trend in the industry has been toward less concentration.  See pp. 125-126, infra. "

Exhibit 3, Lamone Dep.  Leaving aside the valuation problem, that would be, at most, between 3.9% and 4.8% of the total 
volume of API coupling sales in 1980, which Lamone estimated to be at least $ 207 million.  See Lamone Dep. at 51-52.  At oral 
argument, Crane disputed Harsco's ""estimate"" of 6%.  The support offered for the figure is grossly inadequate in the Court's 
view.  Harsco failed to elicit data confirming it either in depositions or interrogatories. "

1123,2," .  The court also granted defendants a new trial conditioned on a reversal by this court of the judgment n. o. v., and Red

illegal. Whoever violates this Section shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned, with or without hard labor, not 
more than three years, or both. Section 51:137 confers a civil action for treble damages on parties injured by violations of section 51:122. "
1124,4," .  The reason for focusing on the source of restraints on distributors is economic.  Distributors have an incentive to agree among 
themselves to restrict competition, such as by allocating territories, in order to raise the price they receive for their product 
because to do so normally increases their profits.  Such a horizontal conspiracy, which generates simply an increase in prices, is 
generally detrimental to consumers and is illegal per se. Not only does a horizontal conspiracy among distributors hurt consumers, however; it injures the manufacturer as well because 
the higher retail price of the product reduces the quantity sold at retail and hence the quantity demanded from the manufacturer. 
A manufacturer generally prefers that its distributors sell its product for as low a price as possible, given the price at which it sells 
the product to them, i. e., for as small a markup as possible over the wholesale price, because its sales of the products are 
normally greater the lower the retail price.  See Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 56 & n.24, 97 S. Ct. at 2560 & n.24. A 
manufacturer thus will typically encourage intrabrand competition in order to enhance interbrand competition, i. e., the 
competitiveness of its product with those of other manufacturers. Sometimes, however, a manufacturer will find it advantageous 
to impose restrictions, such as assigned territories, on its distributors in order to induce them to undertake advertising or 
promotional activities, to render more or better services to customers, or simply to push the product more vigorously.  By 
facilitating such efforts on the part of distributors, the restrictions tend to increase retail sales of the product, and may do so on 
balance even if they also generate some increase in the price the distributors charge.  Thus, restrictions on intrabrand 
competition are sometimes a means whereby a manufacturer can increase interbrand competition.  Because increasing 
interbrand competition is generally socially desirable and because intrabrand restrictions are generally not socially harmful when 
there is significant interbrand competition, manufacturer-imposed, i. e., vertical, restraints are governed by the rule of reason. 
See id. at 54-55, 97 S. Ct. at 2559-2560; but see id. at 51 n.18, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n.18 (vertical price restrictions are per se 
illegal). "
1125,5," .  Given the divergent interests between a manufacturer and its distributors, see note 4, supra, it is unlikely that a manufacturer 
not controlled by its distributors, such as Liquid, would be a party to a distributor-created, and hence distributor-serving, 
conspiracy."
1125,6," .  Vertical price restrictions are per se illegal.  Continental T.V., 413 U.S. at 51 n.18, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n.18."
1125,7," .  The principal evidence upon which Red Diamond relied was the testimony of a former Liquid salesman, Robert L. Williams, III.  
That testimony, together with a letter to which Red Diamond refers, establishes at most that Liquid did not seek business from 
customers or distributors under contract to a competitor. Williams also testified, however, that Liquid would sell to a customer 
that was willing to cancel its contract with the competitor. Thus, the proffered evidence may well demonstrate only that Liquid 
preferred exclusive dealing arrangements or that it was wary of inducing breaches of contract.  While Williams' testimony is "
1126,," probably consistent with the existence of a conspiracy among manufacturers, it is not sufficient to establish such a conspiracy. 
At the very least, there would have to be some showing of an agreement between Liquid and other manufacturers, which there 
is not. Red Diamond also relied on documents showing a wide divergence in the prices Liquid charged its distributors throughout the 
country for cylinder oxygen.  While Red Diamond offered these data to prove a lack of competition among manufacturers, the 
documents on their face show that the price differentials are explainable simply in terms of differences in the cumulative volume 
of cylinder oxygen sold.  The other bits of evidence Red Diamond offered are similarly unprobative of a conspiracy among 
manufacturers."
1126,8," .  The trial judge instructed the jury that the state and federal antitrust offenses alleged both had the same elements except that 
the latter also carried an interstate commerce requirement, and the jury found a state but not a federal violation.  Thus, the jury 
apparently found the interstate commerce requirement not to have been met.  It is clear, however, that the intermanufacturer 
conspiracy Red Diamond alleged extended well beyond the borders of Louisiana.  It would appear, therefore, that the jury 
rejected the allegation of such a conspiracy. That it should do so, moreover, is not surprising since the principal evidence offered 
was the testimony of former Liquid salesman John Williams, see note 7, supra, who not only was a friend of the president of Red 
Diamond but also testified that a deposition he had previously given in the case was perjured. It is possible, however, that the jury concluded that a conspiracy among manufacturers did exist but that defendant Acme, which 
was merely one of Liquid's distributors, was not involved in the conspiracy. But since the alleged agreements between Liquid 
and its distributors were supposedly an integral part of the intermanufacturer conspiracy, Acme may well have been chargeable 
as a coconspirator in the broader scheme as a matter of law."
1126,9, .  At least one manufacturer in the New Orleans area in fact did all of its own distributing in that area. 
1127,10," .  Also, Red Diamond produced no evidence that its termination per se had an anticompetitive effect.  See Daniels v. All Steel 
Equipment, Inc., supra; H&B Equipment Co., supra."
1127,11," .  According to the Louisiana Supreme Court, ""actual damages"" as used in section 51:1409 means simply ""(monetary) relief 
other than the refund of the purchase price and the return of the status quo that constitutes restitution."" Louisiana ex rel. Guste 
v. General Motors Corp., 370 So.2d 477, 486 (La.1979). Generally, the Louisiana courts allow recovery of lost profits as a 
component of damages in such contexts as breach of contract, George W. Garig Transfer, Inc. v. Harris, 226 La. 117, 130, 75 
So.2d 28, 33 (1954); Al Smith's Plumbing & Heating Service, Inc. v. River Crest, Inc., 365 So.2d 1122, 1126 
(La.Ct.App.1978), torts, Brien v. Quality Transport, Inc., 309 So.2d 743 (La.Ct.App.1975); Camus v. Bienvenue, 91 So.2d 99, 
101 (La.Ct.App.1956) (Tate, J.), and defective products, White v. Martin GMC Trucks, Inc., 359 So.2d 1094, 1101 (La.Ct.App.), 
remanded on other grounds, 362 So. 2d 1116, 1117 (La.), reinstated on remand, 365 So.2d 1135, 1136 (La.Ct.App.1978), writ 
denied, 367 So. 2d 391 (La.1979). The district court cited no authority for its pronouncement that lost profits are not 
comprehended in the damage remedy afforded by ยง 51:1409, and we find none.  Nor did the court offer policy reasons for its 
decision, and since loss of profits is the typical injury from some forms of unfair competition, such as disparaging a competitor's 
product, we suspect that policy considerations might well cut against the rule announced by the court.  Also, see note 13, infra."
1127,12," .  HN6[
] Section 5(a)(1) provides that ""(unfair) methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts 
or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."""
1127,13," .  Since the Federal Trade Commission Act does not afford a private cause of action for damages for violations of ยง 5, neither 
the Act nor the federal case law it has spawned provide any guidance on whether lost profits are recoverable under its Louisiana 
counterpart.  See note 11, supra.  Lost profits generally are recoverable as damages under the Sherman Act, however.  E.g., 
Greene v. General Foods Corp., 517 F.2d 635, 663 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 942, 96 S. Ct. 1409, 47 L. Ed. 2d 348 
(1976). "
1132,1," .  It should also be noted that pendent jurisdiction claims alleging abuse of process and malicious prosecution in connection with 
the Macomb County action are before this Court. "
1134,2," .  Another court recently stated the exception this way: HN4[
] ""(The Noerr-Pennington doctrine) does not shield anti-
competitive conduct which abuses the governmental process either because it is pursued without a bona fide hope or intent of 
securing governmental relief or because it seriously undermines the ability of the process to accomplish its objective."" City of 
Newark v. Delmarva Power & Light Co., 497 F. Supp. 323, 1980-81 Trade Cases (CCH) para. 63,677 at p. 77, 633 (D.Del.1980) 
(citations omitted)."
1134,3," .  The carefully reasoned dissent took exception to any departure from the usual standard of pleading under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a).  
542 F.2d at 1086, 1089-90 (Browning, J., dissenting). "
1135,4," .  If there is an ultimate need to impose a stiffer requirement at some stage of the proceedings to protect against frivolous, sham 
litigation claims that might chill the prospective defendant's exercise of the first amendment right of petition, such a requirement 
is more properly considered at the proof stage.  Without ruling on the issue, I note that application of a heightened burden of 
proof has been suggested as a means to account for the constitutional concerns.  Note, Limiting the Antitrust Immunity for 
Concerted Attempts to Influence Courts and Adjudicatory Agencies: Analogies to Malicious Prosecution and Abuse of Process, 
86 Harv.L.Rev. 715, 725 (1973); see also Outboard Marine Corp. v. Pezetel, 474 F. Supp. at 173. "
1136,5," .  It has been suggested that even the plurality opinion lends support to the view that more than one action is not absolutely 
required.  Cyborg Systems, Inc. v. Management Science America, Inc., 1978-1 Trade Cases (CCH), para. 61,927 (E.D.Ill.1978); 
Colorado Petroleum Marketers Ass'n v. Southland Corp., 476 F. Supp. 373, 378 (D.Colo.1979). "
1137,6," .  In the business world, I cannot think that the threat of antitrust litigation would be a realistic deterrent, except in a circumstance 
where the action being contemplated is of marginal merit and there is a tension already existing between the prospective parties 
to the litigation.  In that case, the party should not rest assured that a baseless claim aimed at restraint of trade can be pressed 
with underhanded tactics simply because the party will avoid establishing a pattern or series of such baseless claims. "
1138,7," .  As an aside, it should be noted that the article just cited suggests that the standards for abuse of process may similarly 
provide guidance in this arena. 62 Harv.L.Rev. at 723-35. I specifically decline to rely on such an approach, for there is serious 
question whether the ulterior motive necessarily underlying an abuse of process cause of action is independently sufficient to 
evade the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  Cf.  Outboard Marine Corp., 474 F. Supp. at 175 (indicating that Noerr-Pennington 
exception cannot be reached simply by alleging abuse of process).  As already has been observed, it is clear that an ulterior 
anti-competitive motive alone is not sufficient to bring a sham litigation claim into the Noerr-Pennington exception. "
1147,1," Since that time, an additional action asserting claims arising out of the same circumstances as the JBL and Booth complaints 
was transferred to this district, and consolidated with these actions on October 28, 1980.  Jhirmack of Cincinnati v. Jhirmack 
Enterprises, C-80-3699. "
1149,2," No claim is made that these restrictions amount to per se violations.  See Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 
36, 59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2562, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977); Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 388 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 440 U.S. 936, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1979). HN1[
] "
1150,3," The following colloquy during closing argument sheds further light on the nature of the Booth claim: THE COURT: What happened?  What did Jhirmack do that's a violation of the antitrust laws? MR. CARTWRIGHT: By giving the business, taking the business away, the professional product from the professional 
market, and putting it over the counter through Playtex, they have, in effect, destroyed Jhirmack's and my client's market in 
the professional market.  They have destroyed that market; and it's tended towards the creation of a monopoly on the part 
of Redken and the others that service that market and so they have decreased the amount of competition dramatically in 
the professional market, whereas, according to some of the testimony that we have in the record, Jhirmack was number 
one in that market.  Now, it's zilch. THE COURT: So what you're saying is that the violation of the antitrust laws consisted of the agreement between Jhirmack 
and Playtex by which โฆ the ability of the distributors to sell Jhirmack products exclusively was taken away and destroyed 
and they faced the competition of OTC outlets? MR. CARTWRIGHT: They put them out of business is what happened. "
1151,," THE COURT: Now, let me ask you a question.  I understand the injury to your people.  What is the injury to competition? MR. CARTWRIGHT: They dramatically reduced the competition in the market that we're talking about.  Jhirmack no longer 
is an effective competitor in that market and at the time this happened was either number one or number two in the 
professional market; so they have destroyed competition in substantial part in the professional market dramatically, 
dramatically reduced it. THE COURT: So what you're saying is that they have reduced competition by making it unattractive to salons to continue to 
carry Jhirmack because it's been sold OTC; is that right? MR. CARTWRIGHT: As a practical matter they can't do it."
1151,4, The parties agree that the relevant geographic market consists of the entire United States. 
1152,5," Plaintiffs also argue that shampoo and conditioners must be treated as a separate line for two additional reasons.  They say 
that the demand for sales outside of assigned territories was mainly for shampoos and conditioners and that those products 
must therefore be treated as a separate line.  The evidence shows, however, that the amount of diversion represented by 
shampoos and conditioners was roughly in proportion to their share in total sales of Jhirmack products.  Second, they contend 
that some Jhirmack distributors had trouble selling cosmetics.  But the evidence indicates that the difficulties arose from 
competitive conditions: price, lack of uniqueness and the time and manner of introduction. "
1153,6," Salons buy products for two purposes, professional use and retail sale.  The difference lies in the packaging; supplies for 
professional use come in large packages, sometimes fitted with special attachments for dispensing.  While products packaged 
for professional use serve a different purpose for the salon from retail packages, that difference is irrelevant to the distributor 
selling to the salon. Furthermore distributors' sales of professional use products are related to sales of retail products in that 
salons will buy a brand for use in the salon in order to promote the retail sale of that brand to their clients.  Both professional use 
and retail beauty products are therefore a part of a single relevant market at the distributor level. "
1155,7," Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. CBS, Inc., 459 F. Supp. 832 (C.D.Cal. 1978), is misplaced.  In that case the court held 
that a relevant submarket might be found to exist even if it was the product of anticompetitive practices.  But it did so at the 
instance of plaintiff and for the purpose of imposing liability on defendant for the very practices which caused the submarket to 
exist.  See discussion of a similar point in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 377, 47 S. Ct. 
400, 405, 71 L. Ed. 684 (1927): "
1156,," The jury was instructed, in substance, that if, during the preceding period in which the plaintiff had been a customer of the 
defendant, it had not merely bought goods from the defendant because of a business necessity, but, with a knowledge of 
the defendant's purpose to monopolize, had knowingly and willfully helped to build up the monopoly, it was in pari delicto, 
and hence could not recover any damages whatever on account of the defendant's refusal to continue to sell it goods; and, 
further, that even if the plaintiff had not been a party to the monopoly, it could not recover damages on the basis of the 
profits which it had earned while a customer of the defendant to the extent that they had been increased by the monopoly 
and exceeded those in a normal business, but that they must be reduced to the basis of normal profits. We find, under the circumstances of this case, nothing in these instructions of which the defendant may justly complain."
1156,8," Jhirmack's 10-K report to the Securities Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1978, states The Company encounters competition in the sale of all its products from a large number of companies, most of which have 
larger facilities and significantly greater financial resources than the Company.  Many of the Company's larger competitors 
market their products through conventional retail outlets, including drug and department stores, while others market their 
products through both professional beauty and barber salons and commercial outlets. "
1161,9," Inasmuch as Jhirmack distributors purchased over $ 900,000 of products under the new product requirement, the Court finds 
the amount of commerce to be not insubstantial. "
1162,10," It should be noted that the Ninth Circuit in Moore, commenting that ""the desirability which results from patent or copyright 
protection constitutes sufficient power for purposes of ยง 1"", neither mentions trademarks nor cites Chicken Delight.  550 F.2d at 
1215-16."
1162,11," The Chicken Delight trademark had been shown to enjoy a unique nationwide preeminence.  See Cash v. Arctic Circle, Inc., 
85 F.R.D. 618, 621 (C.D.Wash. 1977); Esposito v. Mister Softee, Inc., (1976-2) Trade Cas. para. 61,202 at 70, 478-479

1168,1," .  The banking data are taken from the Federal Reserve Board order and reflect data on December 31, 1978."
1168,2, .  The elimination of this potential competition was the sole reason offered by the Board for its refusal to sanction the merger.
1168,3, .  (c) The Board shall not approve 
1169,," (1) any acquisition or merger or consolidation under this section which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in 
furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of 
the United States, or (2) any other proposed acquisition or merger or consolidated under this section whose effect in any section of the country may 
be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint or (of) 
trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by 
the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In every case, the Board shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the 
company or companies and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served."
1169,4," .  Section 1842(c) was adopted in 1966 as an amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. See Pub.L.No. 89-485, ยง 
7, 80 Stat. 237 (1966). During the same session, Congress inserted substantially identical language into the Bank Merger Act 
now found at 12 U.S.C. ยง 1828(c)(5). See Pub. L. No. 89-356, ยง 1, 80 Stat. 7 (1966). The Senate report accompanying the Bank 
Holding Company Act amendments indicates congressional intent that the Federal Reserve Board, in approving bank holding 
company mergers, and the F.D.I.C., the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board, in approving bank mergers apply the same 
substantive standard. S.Rep.No. 1179, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, reprinted in (1966) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2385, 2394. 
We may rely on the legislative history of the amendment to the Bank Merger Act as equally expressing congressional intent as to 
the construction and purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act amendment. See County National Bancorporation v. Board of 
Governors, 1980-81 Trade Cas. (CCH) P63,726 (1980), rehearing granted; First Midland Bank & Trust Co. v. Chemical Fin.

amending the Bank Merger Act."

time, maintain in force the application of the antitrust laws to bank mergers."

1171,8," .  The statute directly applicable here is the Bank Merger Act. HN4[
] The Bank Holding Company Act formerly listed the 
following factors: (1) the financial condition of the company or companies and the banks concerned; (2) their prospects; (3) the character of their management; (4) the convenience, needs, and welfare of the communities and the area concerned; and (5) whether or not the effect of such acquisition or merger or consolidation would be to expand the size or extent of the bank 
holding company system involved beyond limits consistent with adequate and sound banking, the public interest, and the 
preservation of competition in the field of banking. Section 1842(c)(2), Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, ch. 240, ยง 3(c), 70 Stat. 134 (1956). Congress amended both the Bank Merger and Bank Holding Company Acts in the same session. In doing so it eliminated these 
factors, including ""preservation of competition,"" in favor of explicit antitrust standards separate from ""convenience and needs."" 
As we discuss in the text, proponents of the amendments distinguished banking from competitive factors."
1171,9, .  See 112 Cong.Rec. 2449 (1966) (remarks of Congressman Halpern); 112 Cong.Rec. 2450 (remarks of Congressman Ashley). 
1172,10," .  Unlike the previous version of the Bank Holding Company Act, see note 8 supra, the previous version of the Bank Merger Act 
did not mention preservation of competition in the context of the banking factors to be considered. See Bank Merger Act of 1960, 
Pub.L.No. 86-463, 74 Stat. 129 (1960)."
1172,11," .  The Board's finding of ""substantially adverse competitive effects"" resulting from the merger (Board Op. at 7) indicates a 
violation of the Clayton Act standard.  12 C.F.R. ยง 250.182(b) (1980)."
1172,12," .  Banking differs from other industries in that the interest rates on various consumer checking and savings accounts two basic 
""products"" are set by government regulation. There remain many other areas in which banks can compete; the decision to 
employ the Clayton Act standard in the Bank Merger and Bank Holding Company Acts in the wake of United States v. 
Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963) indicates the importance Congress placed on 
attaining a competitive banking industry. "
1173,13, .  The use of inconsistent adjectives constitutes yet another attack by antitrust jargon on the English language.
1173,14," .  The actual potential competition doctrine was given its most important impetus by Donald Turner's seminal article 
Conglomerate Mergers and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 1313, 1379-1386 (1965). The most extensive recent 
treatment is found in 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 69-161 (1980). For a discussion of the doctrine's applicability to 
commercial banks, see Austin, The Evolution of Commercial Bank Merger Antitrust Law, 36 Bus.Law. 297, 333-370 (1981)."
1173,15," .  We recently affirmed summarily a district court decision in Southwest Miss. Bank v. F.D.I.C., 625 F.2d 1013 (5th Cir. 1980), 
affirming 499 F. Supp. 1 (S.D.Miss.1979). That case involved primarily determination of the geographic market and existing 
competition in that market. However, the district court did consider the actual potential competition doctrine and implied approval 
of it, but made no final decision concerning its application because this was a matter to be addressed by the F.D.I.C. on remand 
when measuring the anticompetitive effect of the proposal on the geographic market defined by the court. Our affirmance of the 
district court's decision did not necessarily constitute a full ratification of its rationale. Therefore, we consider the issue de novo. "
1174,16," .  In Kennecott Copper Corp. v. FTC, 467 F.2d 67 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 909, 94 S. Ct. 1617, 40 L. Ed. 2d 114 
(1974), the Tenth Circuit accepted the doctrine in affirming the FTC's challenge to a proposed merger between Kennecott and 
Peabody Coal Company. The Tenth Circuit did not require a strong showing that Kennecott would probably enter the coal 
market in the absence of the merger. Kennecott was decided before the Supreme Court abstained from approving the theory in 
Falstaff and Marine Bancorporation. For criticism of the decision, see 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra at P 1123E."
1174,17," .  Professor Brodley, in his excellent critique of the potential competition doctrine and its treatment in the courts, argues that we 
should entirely abandon economic prediction and rely exclusively on the structure of the concentrated market and on the 
outsider's status as a most likely entrant in determining whether to invalidate a merger. Brodley, supra. He notes the easy 
applicability of the presumptive rules established for mergers of present competitors in cases like United States v. Philadelphia 
National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963). This approach would result in stricter prevention of anticompetitive conglomerate and geographic extension mergers. Professor 
Brodley musters significant legislative history to support the contention that Congress desired stricter antitrust enforcement. See 
87 Yale L.J. at 40-45. In this opinion, we follow the general approach laid out in the previous cases, rather than adopt Professor Brodley's analysis. 
However, we do not foreclose the Board's consideration of his analysis on remand. Of course, Mercantile may muster legislative 
history and economic analysis to support its own views."
1174,18," .  Because Section 1842(c)(2), like Section 7 of the Clayton Act, prohibits the substantial lessening of competition ""in any 
section of the country,"" the merger may be prohibited if it substantially lessens competition in either El Paso or Waco. See 
United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 86 S. Ct. 1665, 16 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1966); Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 
370 U.S. 294, 337, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1530, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 542 (1962). "
1175,19," .  Although the Board mentioned concern over the concentration of banking resources in Texas, it did not rely on statewide 
concentration in concluding that the merger would violate the Clayton Act standard."
1175,20," .  Both markets satisfy the criteria suggested by Areeda and Turner for identifying concentrated markets. The 86.1 per cent 
share held by the four largest banks in El Paso exceeds the proposed 75 per cent minimum; the 73.8 share held by the four 
largest banks in Waco exceeds the 65 per cent minimum proposed when the eight largest firms control at least 90 per cent of 
the market. In Waco, the eight largest banks control 92.3 per cent of the market. See 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra at P 1119."
1175,21," .  The McFadden Act, 12 U.S.C. ยง 36, prevents national banks from opening branches outside of the state in which each bank 
is presently doing business. The Bank Holding Company Act prevents bank holding companies from owning shares in banks

1203,1," Plaintiffs contend that competition is mandated in the provision of dialysis services in order to promote quality of care and 
patient choice.  While this is a question which should be first resolved by the agencies, it is something of a puzzle to understand 
how competition can operate to improve quality of care or patient choice in a situation where there is, at least theoretically, no 
excess capacity and full utilization of all allocated stations. "
1209,1," The complaint also alleges jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C.  ยง 13c, but that section provides exemption of non-profit institutions 
from price discrimination provisions and is irrelevant to the present action. "

1211,3," The Honorable Donald D. Alsop, United States District Judge, directed plaintiffs to set forth their claims in simple, concise, and 
direct terms, including jurisdictional grounds therefore. "
1212,4," The complaint also claims jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  ยง 1338. That section, however, provides jurisdiction for claims of unfair 
competition when joined with related claims under patent law."
1212,5," The complaint alleges that Fountain's advice to its distributors that use of the POS holder constituted infringement also violated 
the settlement agreement. But that agreement only mentions ""claims,"" and there is no evidence on the record that Fountain ever 
brought a claim for infringement against any of its distributors. "
1213,6," It may be inferred that plaintiffs intend the allegation that Fountain fraudulently obtained its patent to be a claim arising under 
the patent laws.  But only the United States would have standing to bring such a claim.  Tubeco, Inc. v. Crippen Pipe Fabrication 
Corp., 402 F.Supp. 838, 845 (E.D.N.Y. 1975), affirmed 538 F.2d 314 (2d Cir. 1976). It may also be inferred that plaintiffs' allegation that Fountain alleged infringement while knowing that its patent was invalid is 
meant to state a violation of the patent laws.  The case of Kaplan v. Helenhart Novelty Corp., 182 F.2d 311, 313 (2d Cir. 1950), 
may be read to suggest that this court has jurisdiction of this claim under 28 U.S.C.  ยง 1338(b). There the court upheld 
jurisdiction where defendants allegedly gave notice of infringement to plaintiff and its customers.But in that case the court noted 
that the validity and scope of the patents was at issue.  Here that issue is moot because defendants disclaimed any right to the 
patents on which they threatened suit.  Thus, because the claim raises no issue under the patent laws, jurisdiction is not present 
under 28 U.S.C.  ยง 1338(b).  Cf.  Transitron Electronic Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 487 F.Supp. 885, 893 (D. Mass. 1980) 
(patent HN3[
] misuse is an equitable defense to an action for infringement but is not grounds for affirmative relief)."
1213,7," Plaintiffs make other vague allegations of additional violations in their memorandum, based on documents they claim are in 
Fountain's files and not filed with the court.  It is not clear what these alleged violations are. "
1214,8," Defendants also contend that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because Count III does not 
explicitly allege fraud on the patent office. Plaintiffs do, however, allege that the patents were invalid and void, and the facts 
allow an inference that this invalidity was within defendants' knowledge.  Following the rule that ambiguous pleadings should be 
construed in favor of the pleading party, E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Berkley & Co., Inc., 620 F.2d 1247, 1268, n.37 (8th Cir. 
1980), this is not an adequate ground for dismissal."
1214,9," Defendants also rely on Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977). That case speaks, however, to the 
relationship between the alleged injury and the alleged antitrust violation present under ยง 7 of the Clayton Act and does not 
support defendants' position regarding standing. "
1215,10," Defendants argue that plaintiffs' answer to a request for admission should be treated by the court as an admission establishing 
that the defense definition of the relevant market is correct.The request for admissions stated: Concerns in the OCS business not only compete with each other but with (1) the office employee's vacuum bottle of home-made 
coffee or other beverage, (2) the office coffee pot that is serviced entirely by the user of users, (3) public vending machines, and 
(4) carry-out restaurants. Plaintiffs replied, ""1, 2, 3, and 4, are admitted in some instances and denied in other instances."" Defendants could have moved the court under Rule 36(a) to determine the sufficiency of this ambiguous answer after it was 
received but did not do so.  No request to find noncompliance was made in accordance with the rules, and in the circumstances, 
it would be inappropriate for the court to order the matter admitted. "
1216,11," The presence of both these elements states a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. 345 U.S. at 608-609. Plaintiffs 
mention section 2 of the Sherman Act in connection with their tying claims, but they do not mention section 1.  Alleged violations 
of section 2 were analyzed, supra. "

1221,3," An employee of Lift Truck Rental and Sales Company, Richard A. Giuffre, took part in some of the negotiations and originally 
owned 18 per cent of IHS.  Before this action was begun, Giuffre sold his share of the business to the plaintiff Gowdish.  Giuffre 
is not a party to this suit.  Giuffre remained in Detroit for some months after IHS began operations in Greensboro, closing out 
operations of Lift Truck Rental.  Giuffre was physically present and active at IHS in Greensboro during only the months of

1238,6," .  Cooperatives are of two types: a ""bargaining"" co-op is strictly concerned with the marketing of its members' milk, and 
maintains no processing facilities, i. e., dairies. An ""operating"" co-op does own processing facilities and, to the extent it desires, 
processes its members' raw milk in its own facilities. All the members of the Super Pool except D.I. are ""operating"" co-ops."
1238,7," .  FMO-7 is the Federal Milk Marketing Order for the Georgia area. It was promulgated by the U.S.D.A. and established, inter 
alia, a minimum price which all handlers regulated by that Order (like Kinnett) must pay to Georgia producers for their milk. Any 
price asked for by the producers which is in excess of this federal order minimum price is an ""over-order"" amount or ""premium."" "
1239,8," .  To qualify for the option payments, a manufacturing plant had to meet certain requirements. Among other things, it had to 
have a Grade A rating and had to have a minimum of 50,000 lbs. per day. In addition, the plants were required to own 
manufacturing facilities capable of processing their milk."
1239,9," .  Before the Minnesota-Wisconsin area became pooled on a Federal Order (June 1, 1976), ARSPC would pay the participating 
plants an amount for the milk equal to what the manufacturing plant could get for it from the nearest federal order."
1239,10," .  The mechanics of the option payments work as follows: Each member cooperative of the Standby Pool would pay into a fund 
a reserve pool ""assessment"", based upon that cooperative's total Class I sales. The monies in the fund were then distributed to 
unregulated milk manufacturing plants in the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) area based upon a formula designed to provide the 
plants (and the producers serving them) with a return about equal to what they would have received as pool plants under the 
nearby federal order. "
1240,11," .  It should be noted that the terms of the contracts between the participating plants granting the options and the Standby Pool 
changed several times between 1970 and 1976. The 1970 contracts gave the Standby Pool a right of first refusal on the milk for 
a period beginning ""at least 24 hours prior to โฆ time of farm pick up"" and continuing until 12 hours after receipt of the raw milk at 
the receiving facilities. It also provided that ""in the event Associated Reserve Pool does not exercise its option, the supplier may 
use or commit for use any of its Grade A milk supply for production of manufactured milk products, but will not accept any offer 
from or make a sale to, another purchaser of milk for other than manufacturing use without giving notice to Associated Reserve 
Pool of its intent to sell such milk and afford Associated Reserve Pool its right of first call on such milk."" The 1971 contract retained the time period in which the Pool could exercise its option; i. e., from 24 hours before pick-up to 12 
hours after receipt at the plant. However, the requirement that the supplier only use milk, not called on by the Pool, for 
manufacturing purposes unless first notifying the Pool was not included in the 1971 or subsequent contracts. By 1973, both provisions had been changed: The Pool could exercise its option by telephone notification ""at least 24 hours prior 
to the approximate time of shipment"" and milk on which the option was not exercised was ""free of any marketing rights of 
ARSPC."" In 1976, yet another modification occurred, the time for exercising the option being ""at least 24 hours prior to the time of farm 
pick-up"", and the reference to milk on which the option was not exercised allowing the supplier to retain it ""for such use or 
disposition as it shall determine."" There is some question as to whether or not some of these changes were required, or at least encouraged, by certain consent 
decrees entered in United States v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 29 (1975) and United States v. Mid-America 
Dairymen, Inc., 1977-1 Trade Cas. P 61,509. The AMPI consent decree was entered on April 30, 1975; however, the antitrust 
case leading to the decree was initially filed on Feb. 1, 1972. The Mid-America action commenced on Dec. 27, 1973 and the 
decree was entered on May 17, 1977. It is admitted that at least the 1976 change ""for such use โฆ as it shall determine"" was 
placed there because of the AMPI consent decree (Smith Dep. at p. 271). And it is reasonable to assume that, at least after the 
initial (1971) contract change, the AMPI and Mid-America cases had some influence on the terms of the Standby Pool contracts."
1240,12, .  The defendant does not presently belong to ARSPC. Its membership was from 1970 to 1978. 
1242,13," .  The Class I price is determined for each federal order in the following manner: First, the Administrator takes the average price 
which a number of milk manufacturing plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin pay for Grade B milk; the Administrator then adds 90 
cents to this M-W price and gets the minimum Class I price at Eau Claire, Wisconsin (the ""base point""); to this base-point 
minimum price is added 15 cents per cwt. of milk for every 100 miles which the milk travels from the Eau Claire base point. (The 
90 cents plus 15 cents/cwt/100 miles is called the ""Class I differential"".) "
1243,14," .  The disputes discussed, supra, occurred when D.I. and these processors had only oral agreements. D.I. claims that the 
processors' unilateral abrogations of these ""handshake"" agreements is what prompted D.I. to seek written supply contracts."
1243,15," .  Because of this grandfather clause, these original contracts cannot be characterized as true full supply contracts. "
1244,16," .  Holland Dairy Products Co.: In July 1971, D.I. was supplying approximately 90 percent of the raw milk needs of Holland's 
regulated processing plant at Holland, Indiana, and was also supplying the Holland manufacturing facility at Tell City, Indiana. D.I. and Holland had an ongoing dispute concerning the proper amount owed D.I. members for milk it had supplied Holland. The 
difference amounted to between $ 50,000 and $ 60,000. When D.I. presented Holland with a written sales agreement in late July 
1971, Holland found a number of the provisions of the proposed contract to be unacceptable, and so advised D.I. D.I. advised 
Holland that if Holland did not wish to enter a written supply agreement, D.I. had other markets for its members' milk. 
Negotiations between the parties stalemated on August 30, 1971 and D.I. consequently reduced its September 1, 1971 
deliveries to Holland by 10,000 gallons, a quantity roughly equal to Holland's daily Class II needs. At this time Holland sought 
and obtained on September 3, 1971 a Temporary Restraining Order to compel D.I. to resume supplying Class II milk to the 
Holland plant. Within a short time, the parties reached agreement on a written contract in the form of a ""specified volume 
agreement."" Borden Co.: D.I. presented Borden's plants, along with all other customers, with written (full supply) contracts during the summer 
of 1971. While D.I. was attempting to negotiate with Borden for the written supply agreement, Borden cut off its entire supply of 
D.I. member milk at its Lexington, Kentucky plant. At the same time, Borden's Jackson and Meridian, Mississippi plants began 
replacing their D.I. supply with other sources of milk, sometimes refusing to accept D.I. member milk which they had orally 
agreed to purchase. (It should be noted that at least with Borden, there was an appreciable disparity in bargaining position, 
Borden being of much greater ""financial stature"" than the defendant). D.I. felt that the cut-off by Borden was unfair because it 
was done without notice. The defendant felt it necessary to get Borden's attention in order for Borden to sit down at the 
bargaining table and discuss a written supply agreement (Borden had a habit of stalling, or just refusing to talk to the defendant). 
As a result, on September 1, 1971, D.I. notified Borden that it would be discontinuing its supply of milk to the Borden-Meridian 
plant. However, D.I. resumed its supply to the plant after only one day because Borden sought and obtained the Temporary 
Restraining Order requiring D.I. to do so. The parties then met to negotiate a mutually acceptable written contract, and finally 
agreed to a contract which required D.I. to supply and Borden to purchase specified percentages of their raw milk supplies, and 
which required Borden to reduce unneeded supplies on a pro rata basis. This agreement was made a part of the order 
dissolving the Temporary Restraining Order and stated in part: ""During any month in which Buyer's need for processing at 
Buyer's plant is less than the amount (shown on Exhibit A) for such month, the Buyer shall reduce its purchases from seller and 
other suppliers by diversion on a pro rata basis."" (emphasis added)"
1244,17," .  Testimony of Ben Morgan, Jr., Executive Vice President and General Manager of D.I., indicates that the defendant was not 
taking an uncompromising position in the negotiations: ""Naturally, I tried to sell them on full supply milk, and when I couldn't sell 
them on full supply, I tried to sell them on a partial supply."""
1244,18," .  Beginning in late 1972 and continuing through the summer of 1973 there was a severe drought in the eastern United States. 
This caused feed and grain production to decline. In addition to the drought, sales of grain to Russia caused increased prices for 
feed. "
1245,19," .  In recognition of the economic conditions urged by D.I. as necessitating the price increase, the Secretary of Agriculture took 
steps immediately raising the minimum price by $ .40 per cwt. and putting the increase in effect immediately, rather than 
awaiting the customary two-month lag. Also, shortly after the President froze all prices (July 1, 1973), he exempted all raw 
agricultural products, including dairy products, from the freeze, thus permitting processors like Kinnett to pass on their increased 
costs to their customers. "

A And does move that far, yes, sir. Q So it is not unusual for milk to move great distances today because of the way it is handled? A Yes, sir, that is correct.

] a 
Capper-Volstead organization could not ""achieve monopoly by preying on independent producers."" Webster's New International 
Dictionary, Second Edition Unabridged, 1953, defines the word ""prey"" in the intransitive sense as ""to make a raid or raids for the 
sake of booty; to commit deprivations, to seize and devour prey โฆ to commit violence or inflict harm in or through 
predaciousness; as cats prey upon robins; sharpers that prey on the poor"", and in the transitive sense, ""to plunder; pillage; rob; 
also to take as prey."" The same authority defines predatory as ""of, pertaining to, or characterized by, plundering, as predatory 
instincts; practicing rapine; given to plundering or robbery; plundering, pillaging; as, predatory excursion or party"" and also 
""destructive, consumptive, injurious."" One court conservatively remarked that ""(t)he term (predatory) probably does not have a 
well-defined meaning in the context it was used, but it certainly bears a sinister connotation."" Telex Corp. v. International 
Business Mach. Corp., 510 F.2d 894, 927 (10th Cir. 1975). Professor Sullivan treats predatory conduct at some length as 
follows: ""Predatory business conduct can be defined as conduct which has the purpose and effect of advancing the actor's 
competitive position, not by improving the actor's market performance, but by threatening to injure or injuring actual or potential 
competitors, so as to drive or keep them out of the market, or force them to compete less effectively. The earliest cases labeled 
predatory conduct as a violation of Section 2 when it was used to gain or hold monopoly power; the predatory monopolist 
became a figure in the national demonology."" ""There has been much talk about predatory behavior, but few efforts to analyze it. Businessmen and judges think they know it 
when they see it. Economists tend to doubt that it occurs, at least very often, because it is likely to cost the firm using it more 
than can be gained from it."" โฆ. ""(T)here will be something odd, something jarring or unnatural seeming about it. It will not strike the informed observer as normal 
business conduct, as honestly industrial."" Sullivan, Antitrust Law, 108, 111-112 (1979). There is a trend towards stretching the word predatory so as to let it include less pejorative conduct; for instance, conduct may 
be classified predatory if it evidences an intent unnecessarily (see Greyhound Computer Corp. v. International Business

1268,1," Wabash Computer was a subsidiary of Wabash Magnetics, Inc. "
1281,1," SCM did not attempt to define the composition of the relevant product market in 1956, because SCM did not allege that 
Xerox's conduct at this time was directed at monopolizing the relevant product market then in existence. The relevant product 
market, which SCM claimed Xerox monopolized by 1964, allegedly consisted only of plain- and coated-paper copiers, and was 
described as the convenience office copier market. SCM also argued that plain-paper copiers by 1964 formed a relevant 
submarket over which Xerox acquired monopoly control. Xerox on the other hand argued that the relevant product market 
included offset, spirit, and mimeograph equipment. In any event, the jury found the markets suggested by SCM existed in 1969 
but not in 1964. In view of SCM's failure to challenge the jury's determination on appeal, we see no reason to disturb the jury's 
finding that the relevant product market and submarket SCM defined did not exist in 1964. Thus, we have no clear picture of the relevant product market that existed in 1956 when Xerox entered into its final agreement 
with Battelle that SCM claims violated the antitrust laws."
1281,2, Chester Carlson received 40% of the consideration given Battelle. 
1282,3," In September 1956, Xerox also entered into an agreement with another research organization named Horizons, Inc. Under the 
agreement, Horizons granted Xerox non-exclusive licenses under xerographic patents it had obtained and, like Battelle, agreed 
to perform xerographic research exclusively for Xerox. The agreement was renewed in 1960."
1282,4, Xerox received only one grant-back patent which it used in a commercial product. 
1283,5," SCM originally sought to recover damages for financial injuries it sustained as far back as 1964, the year SCM first requested 
a license from Xerox to manufacture its own plain-paper copier. Since the complaint was filed on July 31, 1973, the period of injury for which recovery could be sought ordinarily would be 
governed by the four-year statute of limitations provided under the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15b (1976), and extend back only 
to July 31, 1969. Because the FTC instituted a proceeding against Xerox on January 16, 1973, ยง 16(i) of Title 15 of the United 
States Code, which tolls the normal statute of limitations upon the commencement of an FTC proceeding, extended the period 
back to January 16, 1969. Finally, Xerox did not object to including the first two weeks of January, so that January 1, 1969 
became the outside date. SCM asserted, nevertheless, that its injuries sustained in 1964 were not ascertainable until the FTC proceeding was 
commenced in 1969 and that, therefore, it was entitled to recovery for losses sustained in 1964. Because of the statute of 
limitations question, SCM's claim for damages prior to 1969 was characterized as a distinct claim the ""1964 Exclusion Claim"" to 
avoid confusion. SCM has not pursued its 1964 exclusion claim on this appeal because the jury found that SCM lacked the 
intent, preparedness, and capacity to enter into plain-paper copying in 1964. Thus, we need not address the statute of limitations 
issue. "
1284,6," The jury rejected SCM's claim that Xerox had entered into a concerted refusal to deal with Rank Xerox and Fuji Xerox aimed at 
excluding competitors from manufacturing plain-paper copiers worldwide as of 1964 or 1969."
1284,7," While only Xerox's patent-related conduct was alleged by SCM to have caused it any injury, the jury's finding that Xerox 
monopolized the relevant market and submarket in 1969 in violation of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act must be presumed to have been 
based upon the evidence offered by SCM against Xerox concerning both Xerox's patent-related and non-patent-related conduct. 
The latter category could include the Horizons Corporation patent acquisition, the grant-backs of licenses from Xerox's 
licensees, the employee covenants not to compete, and the joint venture agreements entered into between Xerox and the Rank 
Organisation and Fuji Photo. As Judge Newman observed below, however, it is likely that the jury primarily relied upon the 1956 
Xerox-Battelle agreement as the basis for its ยง 2 violation finding. See 463 F. Supp. at 1008."
1284,8," Although we seriously question the appropriateness of applying the avoidable consequences doctrine to a case such as the 
one before us, we need not resolve that issue in light of our holding that the conduct complained of by SCM did not violate the 
antitrust laws. "
1287,9," Notwithstanding that ""(t)he law recognizes that (a patentee) may assign to another his patent, in whole or in part, and may 
license others to practice his invention,"" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, 395 U.S. at 135, 89 S. Ct. at 
1582, SCM argues that a distinction should be made between the exploitation of a patent by an inventor and an investor. We "
1288,," assume, therefore, that had Chester Carlson possessed the resources to commercialize xerography to the same extent as did 
Xerox, SCM would not have challenged a refusal by the inventor to license his patents as violative of the antitrust laws. 
Investors, however, play a key role, if not an indispensable one today, in both the inventive process and commercialization of 
inventions. And it is fair to say, we think, that the contribution of the investor in both the funding of research that leads to 
inventions and the promotion that necessarily must follow to achieve successful commercialization is of comparable value. See 
generally Picard v. United Aircraft Corp., 128 F.2d 632, 642 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 651, 63 S. Ct. 46, 87 L. Ed. 524 
(1942) (Frank, J., concurring). In either case, the ultimate intended beneficiary of the patent laws the public is equally benefited. 
See generally Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Industries, Inc., 610 F.2d 1059, 1070-71 (3d Cir. 1979); United States v. 
Parker-Rust-Proof Co., 61 F. Supp. 805, 808 (E.D.Mich.1945); In re Anthony, 56 C.C.P.A. 1443, 414 F.2d 1383, 1398 (Cust. & 
Pat.App.1969); In re Herr, 377 F.2d 610, 619, 54 CCPA 1315 (1967). Since Xerox participated financially in both the inventive 
process by funding research at Battelle and the subsequent commercialization of xerography by bringing the first plain-paper 
copier to the market, we see little reason to deny Xerox the full benefit of the patents it acquired on this basis alone."
1288,10," We leave for an appropriate case the resolution of the question whether damage liability can accrue to a holder for refusing to 
license patents that he subsequently abuses through pooling or otherwise. "
1289,11, In 1960 Horizons Corporation agreed to assign these patents to Xerox.
1289,12," SCM also argues that the two-year covenants not to compete imposed by Xerox on its employees up until 1972 also evidence 
Xerox's willful acquisition of monopoly power. We find this argument wholly without merit. HN12[
] - "
1290,13," This finding was implicit in the jury's affirmative answer to question 20: ""Was the probable effect of Xerox's acquisition of 
patents pursuant to the 1956 Xerox-Battelle agreement, when the agreement was made, substantially to lessen competition or to 
tend to create a monopoly in any relevant market or sub-market that you have found to exist?"" In explaining this question, Judge 
Newman instructed the jurors to determine ""whether the acquisition at the time it was made was reasonably probable to have the 
proscribed effect in the reasonably foreseeable future."" "
1291,14," In connection with the patents assigned on January 2, 1959, the transfer of these improvement patents on that date pursuant 
to the 1956 agreement was a mere formality. Under the 1956 agreement, Xerox acquired an exclusive license to each of 
Battelle's then existing and future xerographic patents on the date the agreement was executed. Thus Xerox had already 
acquired the exclusionary power inherent in each of those patents prior to their formal assignment on January 2, 1959. "
1297,1, A casino's compliance with this limitation is conditioned on the availability of a sufficient number of suitable slot machines. 
1298,2," On December 15, 1978, Bally, aware of the Commission's contemplated action, had submitted its own proposed regulation to 
the Commission which did not contain any percentage limitation on slot machine purchases by any one casino. "
1299,3," The situation would be aggravated in this particular case because Bally is also a casino licensee.  Were its position sustained, 
it would control the source of supply, maintenance and repair of slot machines used by its casino competitors. "
1300,4," At the June 20, 1979 hearing before the Commission, the attorney for another slot machine manufacturer referred to ""a new 
and quite refined machine"" which this manufacturer proposed to introduce into New Jersey. "
1301,5, Argument could well be made that the effect of the regulation is actually to promote competition rather than restrain it. 
1303,1," The provision for agency determination in classifying proceedings as between a contested case which entails adjudication and 
a case to be resolved through rulemaking is parallel to federal administrative agency practice and mirrors the rule of 
discretionary choice embedded in federal administrative law. See SEC v. Chenery, 332 U.S. 194, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 
(1947), rehearing denied 332 U.S. 783, 68 S.Ct. 26, 92 L.Ed. 367 (1947); David L. Shapiro, ""The Choice of Rulemaking or 
Adjudication in the Development of Administrative Policy,"" 78 Harv.L.Rev. 921 (1965). Of course these federal principles are not 
binding on this Court's interpretation of the New Jersey act.  We are not today presented with a situation which calls for us to 
evaluate any federal principles which may be discordant with the aims and wording of our own statutory enactment.  
Nevertheless, it is well to note that in New Jersey a high degree of discretion in making the appropriate procedural choice lies 
with the administrative agency itself, N.J.S.A. 52:14F-7, N.J.S.A. 1:1-2.2(a), and that discretion in these matters is also reposed 
in the Office of Administrative Law. N.J.A.C. 1:1-2.2(c)."
1303,2," In this case, even if the choice by the Casino Control Commission were to proceed by way of adjudication, the hearing would 
not be required to be conducted by an administrative law judge.  This, because the Commission has determined not to delegate 
the hearing function.  The Commissioners, who are the decisional officers of the agency, have elected to conduct the hearing 
themselves.  Hence, under N.J.S.A. 52:14F-8(b), with respect to such cases, the agency is exempt from the jurisdiction of the 
Office of Administrative Law and the assignment of an administrative law judge to conduct its hearings.  See, e.g., In re Orange 
Savings Bank, 172 N.J. Super. 275 (App.Div.1980). "
1304,3," Although not done in this case, it would be prudent for an agency to provide a written explanation or statement of reasons for 
its procedural policy choice.  Cf. N.J.A.C. 1:1-2.2(c). "
1305,4," N.J.A.C. 1:1-1.6(a)(3) reflects this approach.  It recognizes, for example, that even though a case may be fairly classified as 
""contested"" and amenable to adjudication, it may also partake of features that are uncontested in the sense they are ""quasi-
legislative"" and susceptible of ""rulemaking."" In that hybrid situation the agency proceeding may involve dual approaches.  The 
rule states: Contested cases resolve questions relating to the rights, entitlements, and obligations of specific parties even in large, but 
defined, groups.  They do not deal with broad policy issues affecting entire industries or large and undefined classes of 
people.  In some instances an agency's matters may be contested cases (judicial) in part and uncontested cases 
(legislative or regulatory) in part.  It is necessary in each such matter to determine whether the issues can be fruitfully 
separated or whether the needs of fairness, efficiency, and thoroughness require the issues to be handled in a single, 
integrated proceeding. The case here arguably involves the converse situation to that described in N.J.A.C. 1:1-1.6(a)(3), namely, one in which a 
matter is essentially uncontested in the sense that it is quasi-legislative or involves rulemaking but also has certain aspects 
that reasonably require adjudicative procedures for their proper resolution.  While this kind of agency matter is within the 
contemplation of the APA and the rules of the OAL, for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, as well as in this 
concurrence, the present case does not call for the hybridization of adjudicative and rulemaking procedures; rather the 
rulemaking procedures that were actually employed by the agency were sufficient. "
1316,1," But see Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573 (3rd Cir. 1979), which treats antitrust injury and 
standing as related but analytically distinct aspects of the ""problem of determining when a person is sufficiently ""injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.' "" Id. at 582. See also Handler, Changing Trends in 
Antitrust Doctrines: An Unprecedented Supreme Court Term 1977, 77 Col.L.Rev. 979, 994-97 (1977). "
1318,2," This aspect of the court's decision was vacated on appeal to permit further discovery as to jurisdictional facts.  Leasco Data 
Processing Equipment Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F.2d 1326 (1972). See p.  --  infra. "
1319,3," Of course, Congress or the Supreme Court may impose restrictions on the in personam power of federal courts.  These 
restrictions may be found in venue statutes, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and in the federal statutes under which the 
plaintiff brings his action. In this case, Chrysler claims that venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(d), which provides that an alien may be sued in any 
district.  It further asserts that service of process is authorized by the second clause of ยง 12 of the Clayton Act, notwithstanding 
Chrysler's inability to satisfy the venue provisions in the first clause of that section. Section 12 provides: Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such cases 
may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found. Interclisa, on the other hand, argues in its brief that the service of process provision in the second clause of ยง 12 is available only 
when the forum contact requirements of the first clause are met.  We need not decide this question because, as Chrysler points 
out, Interclisa's failure to object to service of process or venue in its Rule 12(b) motion below constitutes a waiver of any such 
objection here.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(h). However, the existence of proper venue is not enough, in itself, for in personam jurisdiction to result from extra-territorial service 
of process. Mariash v. Morrill, 496 F.2d 1138, 1143 (2d Cir. 1974). In order to obtain personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the 
burden of establishing that the defendant has had such minimal contacts with the forum that the maintenance of the suit does 
not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  International Shoe, supra. "
1320,4," Chrysler further alleges that Interclisa's denials are ""pregnant with admissions"" of other contacts such as product sales within 
the United States.  We decline to draw such inferences and note that the first Calzada affidavit explicitly denies that Interclisa 
has sold any of its products in or for distribution in the United States. "

1329,7," .  Oreck alleged, inter alia, that at the insistence of its competitor, Oreck's distributorship of vacuum cleaners manufactured by 
Whirlpool Corporation was terminated. Oreck argued that the termination of its exclusive distributorship was a ""group boycott"" 
under Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959) and that a per se violation 
of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act was stated. The court rejected this position and held that this was a vertical restriction governed by the 
rule of reason. The present case, involving as it does an alleged agreement between a single manufacturer and a single dealer, is, in 
essence, an exclusive distributorship controversy, and the ""group boycott"" doctrine, is, therefore, not applicable. In this case, therefore, something more than an agreement between Whirlpool and Sears to eliminate Oreck must be 
shown. The agreement becomes violative of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act only if it is anticompetitive in purpose or effect in sum, 
it must be tested by the rule of reason. 579 F.2d at 131, 133 (emphasis retained). "

in the fabrication of rebar materials."

1333,3," .  Rule 15(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., pertaining to Amended and Supplemental Pleadings reads as follows: HN1[
] (a) Amendments. A party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading 
is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial 
calendar, he may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by 
leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall 
plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after 
service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders."
1333,4," .  T&T Builders Company, along with more than one hundred other named plaintiffs, filed a similar class action in the same 
federal district court shortly after Summit filed this complaint. These two suits were consolidated with two other civil actions of a 
similar nature brought by the United States Government and the State of Texas."
1333,5," .  It is clear from the complaint that the original class did not include contractors such as D. G. White and S. F. Sanders, Jr., Inc. 
According to article 11 of the original complaint, ""(w)here re-bar materials are sold to a contractor, it is an invariable and uniform 
practice for the contractor to ""pass' the cost of re-bar materials, as well as other supplies, directly on to the builder-owner, 
whether commercial, institutional, or governmental, together with a mark-up on such direct cost as a profit factor."" Obviously, a 
class of ""builder-owners"" was not intended to encompass contractors. In the proposed amended complaint both Sanders and 
White are defined as ""concrete contractors."" "
1334,6," .  The May 15, 1978 letter from William E. Wright, counsel for Summit, to the district judge (Judge Bue) reads in pertinent part as 
follows: While the addition of the party-plaintiffs S. F. Sanders, Jr., Inc. and D. G. White, as direct purchasers, has been properly 
effected, we are left with the standing issue pertaining to the original sole plaintiff, Summit Office Park, Inc. (""Summit""). Although 
the filing of the Amended Complaint moots the pending motions for partial summary judgment and dismissal on this issue, 
Summit remains vulnerable. In Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, Summit concedes its position as an ""indirect purchaser"" of rebar 
materials alleging in paragraph 4 that it ""โฆ has made substantial purchases of rebar materials through its contractors from one 
or more of the named Defendants."" Accordingly, as Summit is aware, it no longer possesses standing under the pronouncements of the Illinois Brick decision, nor 
does it possess sufficient adequacy to represent the class. The class, as redefined, is now protected by the presence of the 
additional party-plaintiffs. While summary judgment may not be appropriate, Summit admittedly is subject to some species of 
dismissal germane to the concept of judgment upon the pleadings. Because of the continued pendency of proposed legislation 
which may restore standing to indirect purchasers, counsel for Summit has felt that he could not voluntarily dismiss and that the 
more prudent and responsible course of action would be to leave that responsibility with this Court. Rec., vol. 4, at 810."
1334,7," .  District Judge Bue's order dealt with each of the consolidated cases; therefore, the summary judgment applied to indirect 
purchasers not only in Summit Office Park, but also in the suit involving the State of Texas and T&T Builders. See note 4."
1334,8," .  The district court opinion states in pertinent part as follows: Thus, through the procedural vehicle of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), counsel for plaintiffs have proposed a novel procedure whereby, if 
adopted, an entirely new cause of action premised on direct purchases and prosecuted by an entirely new set of plaintiffs can be 
plugged in by plaintiffs' counsel following the grant of summary judgment against the original plaintiffs so as to keep alive, albeit 
in different form, the lawsuits in this Court. The Court has considered in detail the respective legal memoranda submitted by counsel and the legal authorities cited therein, 
none of which address specifically the instant issue, and is of the opinion that the federal rules, no matter how liberally 
construed, do not contemplate or otherwise permit the drastic step proposed by plaintiffs' counsel. Although pled, no plaintiffs' 
class has been certified. Thus, the existing causes of action and named plaintiffs having been dismissed, there remains no 
named plaintiff or certified class member with a direct, personal interest in the outcome of the litigation who otherwise might 
possess the present right to step forward and urge amendment. Thus, as stated by Judge Gee, dissenting in Satterwhite v. City 
of Greenville, 557 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1977), rehearing en banc granted, November 1, 1977, ""we now have before us no one who has a continuing stake in the controversy, only a potential lawsuit searching for a sponsor."" "
1335,," Id. at 425. These two actions are in an analogous procedural posture, there being, in the words of Judge Gee, a sponsor, 
plaintiffs' counsel, searching for a potential lawsuit. Such a ""revolving door"" theory of representation through the imaginative use 
of the amendment process, if approved by this Court, would vest in plaintiffs' counsel a power and control over litigation, 
particularly class action litigation, heretofore not recognized by the federal courts. Thus, without addressing the merits of each 
step in the procedural formula which plaintiffs urge this Court to follow, the Court concludes that the grant of partial summary 
judgment as to the indirect-purchaser causes of action pursuant to Illinois Brick precludes the after-the-fact formation of a new, 
distinct set of direct-purchase plaintiffs and their inheritance of the existing litigation. Rather, any such prosecution by direct 
purchasers must be filed anew."
1335,9," .  In the companion case involving T&T Builders, the two substitute plaintiffs who also unsuccessfully attempted to enter the 
case by amendment accepted the district court's holding that any suit by direct purchasers must be filed anew. These two 
plaintiffs then began a new lawsuit by filing a complaint against defendants on behalf of the same class which White and 
Sanders sought to represent. Thus there was no prejudice to either White or Sanders since they also had the option to file their 
own suit or intervene in the companion case instituted by their fellow direct purchasers."
1335,10," .  Defendants contend that Summit had, in essence, admitted its status as an indirect purchaser much earlier when it refused to 
answer or object to interrogatories inquiring whether Summit had ever purchased rebar materials directly from any defendant."
1335,11," .  Appellants rely on McLellan v. Mississippi Power & Light Co., 526 F.2d 870 (5th Cir. 1976), modified on other grounds, 
545 F.2d 919 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc ) where we held that a plaintiff could amend his complaint to add defendants under Rule 
15(a) without seeking leave of court under Rule 21 which provides that ""parties may be dropped or added by order of the court 
on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any state of the action and on such terms as are just."" The cited case is 
inapposite. The amendment in McLellan only added defendants. The original plaintiff who filed the initial complaint continued to 
have a stake in the controversy. He still had standing to file the amendment adding defendants. This is not the situation here "
1336,," since neither the original plaintiff nor the putative class could obtain relief under any available legal theory. Here, neither Summit 
nor the putative class has any continuing interest in the controversy. The other cases cited in appellants' brief are inapplicable. Of these cases, only one deals with a change of plaintiffs. In that 
case, Longbottom v. Swaby, 397 F.2d 45 (5th Cir. 1968), only the description of the capacity in which the plaintiffs sued was 
changed by the amended complaint. Two cases, Case v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., 294 F.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1961) 
and Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090 (5th Cir. 1975), do not involve any attempt to amend a complaint. The rest of the cases 
involve either an addition of extra defendants, an expansion of the facts, or the accession or withdrawal of alternate theories of 
recovery. Not one of the cases deals with an amendment by which the plaintiff and class in the original complaint are substituted 
for new parties, a new class, and a new cause of action. In each case, the original plaintiff continued to have a valid claim and 
an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Cases not in appellants' brief, such as Moore v. Coats Company, 270 F.2d 410 (3rd Cir. 1954), that substitute defendants by an 
amended complaint in order to obtain ""venue jurisdiction,"" are also inappropriate for the same reasons. As in McLellan, the 
original plaintiff who filed the initial complaint continued to have an interest in the outcome of the litigation. He possessed 
standing to amend the complaint to add the defendant."
1336,12," .  There have been cases brought to our attention that involve a substitution of plaintiffs other than those circumstances 
specifically allowed in Fed.R.Civ.P. 25. However, none is completely analogous to the instant case. In National Maritime Union of America v. Curran, 87 F. Supp. 423 (S.D.N.Y.1949), the court rejected an amendment that would 
have substituted new plaintiffs for all the original parties plaintiff and would also change the form of the relief requested. In its 
opinion the court enumerated three categories of cases in which substitution of the parties plaintiff may be allowed under the 
liberal interpretation of Rule 15 on amendments. In the first category the substitution is only a change in the capacity in which the 
original plaintiff brought the action. The second category covers those situations when the United States Government has taken 
over the action as the real party in interest. Finally, the third category allows substitution of plaintiffs to correct a mistake as to 
the person entitled to bring the suit. See also Bucalo v. General Leisure Products Corp., 54 F.R.D. 483 (S.D.N.Y.1971). The first two categories clearly do not apply to the instant case. Although the present suit is more than just a mistake as to the 
proper plaintiff, the third category comes closer to our case than the other two. The court in National Maritime Union relied on three cases to form its third category. The first two cases are totally inapposite 
since one is based on the now defunct Supreme Court Admiralty Rules and the other on Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 concerning 
intervention. The third case in this category, Hackner v. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, 117 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. 1941), involved a 
class action suit where a new plaintiff was allowed to come in by an amended complaint and take over the cases where none of 
the plaintiffs had claims within the jurisdictional amount. Although at first glance this case appears similar to the present suit, 
there exist fundamental differences. As pointed out in National Maritime Union, all the named plaintiffs in Hackner, including the 
new plaintiff, had claims identical in substance.  87 F. Supp. at 427. The claims differed only in the jurisdictional amount sought 
for their individual injuries. Neither the class nor the cause of action was changed in the amended complaint. The original 
plaintiffs had valid claims, which, as members of the class they originally proposed, they could still recover upon in the new 
complaint. Therefore, in Hackner, both the original named plaintiffs and class they represented continued to have a stake in the 
outcome of the same controversy. Thus, they had standing to amend. In the instant case, the change in plaintiffs was 
accompanied by a change in substance; there is a new cause of action. In addition, the amended complaint substitutes not only 
a new plaintiff but also a totally new class. Here, neither the original named plaintiff nor any member of the original class 
continues to have any stake in the case. They are precluded from recovery and lack standing to amend. "
1337,13," .  To hold that the district court had no discretion but to permit such an ""amendment"" as was sought here would be to open the 
door to many foreseeable anomalies and some which, doubtless, we cannot foresee. As one example, though of course nothing 
of the kind has happened here, counsel having several cases pending trial on the court's docket might, upon arriving at 
settlement of one enjoying an advanced position there, simply amend it to assert the claims made in one of his later filed actions 
or a new action entirely rather than dismissing it. "

1340,8," .  The appellees' counsel suggested in oral argument that the defendants might have been prejudiced if the statute of limitations 
ran between the time the original complaint was filed and the time the amendment was filed. But Rule 15(c) expressly provides 
that not all amendments relate back to the date of the original complaint; only amendments relating to the same ""transaction or 
occurrence"" as the original complaint."

defendant, but the majority does not explain what practical difference that distinction makes. At 1283 n.11. See also Technical 
Tape Corp. v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 2 Cir. 1952, 200 F.2d 876, 879 (Clark, J., concurring). (""The only suggested bar is a 
judicial gloss on the broad terms of the rule to the effect that only a ""good' complaint may be amended. But to such a suggestion 
we gave the proper answer in the early days of the rules: (quoting Hackner ) โฆ (I)f there is a real reason in the particular case 
why later matter should not be considered, that reason should be adduced and decision rest upon it, not on some formal 
generalization read into the rules contrary to their spirit."")."
1341,11," .  Because it holds that the amendment offered by Summit was not a Rule 15(a) ""amendment"", the Court does not to reach the 
questions: (a) whether the filing of answers by four of the thirty-one defendants cut off Summit's right to amend its complaint 
without leave of court; and (b) if so, whether the district court abused its discretion in denying leave. I would follow Pallant v. 
Sinatra, S.D.N.Y. 1945, 7 F.R.D. 293, 300, and rule that as to claims for which defendants are alleged to be jointly liable, 
amendment of right should be permitted until all of the defendants have answered. But cf. 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure ยง 1481 (1971). "
1350,1," .  It is obvious from the preceding discussion that, as to both the Section 1 and 2 claims, Chatham's allegations adequately 
plead the injury to competition required by Brunswick Corp., supra. "
1352,1," Proof of conspiracy is essential to plaintiffs' claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and under the Wilson Tariff Act by 
virtue of the language of those statutes. In addition, for reasons explained fully infra, proof of conspiracy is also essential to the 
particular claims plaintiffs have asserted under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the Robinson-Patman Act, and ยง 7 of the Clayton 
Act. The only claims in plaintiffs' case which do not require proof that the defendants conspired are those under the Antidumping 
Act of 1916, 15 U.S.C. ยง 72, which we have already dismissed, with minor exceptions, for other reasons.  Opinion and Order 
(1916 Antidumping Act), 494 F. Supp. 1190 (E.D.Pa.1980), appeal pending, No. 80-2080 (3d Cir.). Since we also dispose of the 
few remaining dumping claims herein, see n. 372 infra, our grant of summary judgment on the issue of conspiracy disposes of all 
the plaintiffs' outstanding claims. During the course of this opinion we shall also make a preliminary determination, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a), 
that plaintiffs have not adduced sufficient independent evidence of the existence of a conspiracy among the defendants to permit 
any evidence in the nature of coconspirator declarations to be admissible against alleged coconspirators under F.R.E. 
801(d)(2)(E). This determination further undermines the plaintiffs' conspiracy claims. "
1353,2," The clerk informs us that from January 1, 1980 to October 1, 1980, the parties filed some 114 briefs or memoranda, two of 
which (filed by plaintiffs) were roughly five hundred pages each in length. We have not counted, but estimate the total brief 
pages alone filed during 1980 to be in excess of 7500. Virtually all of them related to issues affecting summary judgment, 
including evidentiary matters. In one 10-week period (surrounding the pretrial evidentiary hearings) 59 briefs were filed."
1353,3," We note that Rule 56 does not in terms require that only admissible evidence may be considered in connection with a 
summary judgment motion. Rule 56(c) permits judgment to be rendered if the ""pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any"" fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Rule 
56(e), in detailing the form of affidavits to be filed pursuant to a summary judgment motion, requires that they ""set forth such 
facts as would be admissible in evidence,"" but there is no similar specific admissibility requirement for matters contained in the 
other materials listed in Rule 56(c). Nonetheless, the case law is plain that only materials which would be admissible or usable at 
trial may be considered. See generally 6 Moore's Federal Practice P 56.11, at 56-197 to 56-209; 10 Wright & Miller, Federal

components. As is demonstrated in Part VIII, infra, plaintiffs have not seriously advanced a case with respect to other CEP's."

elevation to the Court of Appeals. Although the progress of the case had been slowed by the illnesses and deaths of two judges 
to whom the case had previously been assigned, Judge Higginbotham moved the litigation forward vigorously. One of the most 
important events of Judge Higginbotham's stewardship was the filing of three opinions disposing of the defendants' challenges to 
jurisdiction and venue, to the constitutionality of the 1916 Antidumping Act, and to the extension of the Robinson-Patman Act to 
international price discrimination. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 402 F. Supp. 251 (E.D.Pa.1975)

1354,11," This group of defendants will be frequently referred to herein as the ""Japanese manufacturing defendants."""
1354,12," Sony Corporation and its sales subsidiary, Sony Corporation of America (""SONAM""), were originally named in both suits. 
However, they were dismissed from the Zenith action after settling with Zenith in April 1977, and are defendants now only in the 
NUE action. Seven other principal Japanese defendants are named in both actions, as are eight of their subsidiaries: Matsushita Electric 
Corporation of America (""MECA""); Toshiba America, Inc. (""TAI""); Hitachi Kaden Hanbai Kabushiki Kaisha (""Hitachi Kaden""); 
Hitachi Sales Corporation of America (""HSCA""); Sharp Electronics Corporation (""SEC""); Sanyo Electric Trading Co., Ltd.; Sanyo 
Electric Inc.; and Mitsubishi International Corporation (""MIC""). Sears and Motorola are named only in the Zenith suit, as are Melco Sales, Inc., Sanyo Manufacturing Corp., Matsushita 
Electronics Corporation, Matsushita Electric Trading Co., Ltd., and Quasar Electronics Corp., also a Matsushita subsidiary. "
1355,13," The major aspects of this claim have been dismissed. See Opinion and Order (1916 Antidumping Act) 494 F. Supp. 1190 
(E.D.Pa.1980), appeal pending, No. 80-2080 (3d Cir.)."
1355,14," The original complaints included counts alleging that price discrimination between Japanese and American purchasers 
violated the Robinson-Patman Act. These counts were dismissed for failure to state a claim.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co., 402 F. Supp. 244 (E.D.Pa.1975) (Higginbotham, J.)."
1355,15," Zenith challenges two acquisitions. The first is the 1974 sale by Motorola of its consumer electronic products division and its 
""Quasar"" tradename to Matsushita. The other is the 1976 acquisition by the Sanyo interests of a majority interest in Warwick 
Electronics, Inc., a manufacturer of television receivers for sale to U.S. private label customers, the largest of which was Sears. 
Sears had owned 25% of Warwick's common shares, and after the transactions was 25% owner of Warwick's successor, Sanyo 
Manufacturing Corp. (an American corporation)."
1355,16," The period covered by this litigation stretches from the filing of the respective complaints backward the four-year statutory 
period to, in the case of Zenith, the late 70's by virtue of amendment to the complaint. NUE's damage claims were essentially cut 
off when they abandoned the television business."
1355,17," Certain of the defendants have asserted counterclaims against Zenith, attacking Zenith on two fronts. First, they allege that 
Zenith, acting alone and in combination and conspiracy with others, engaged in territorial allocations, price discrimination, and 
horizontal and vertical price fixing arrangements, and effected certain ""key dealer preferences"" in violation of the Robinson-
Patman Act and ยงยง 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Second, they accuse Zenith and its coconspirators of seeking to interfere with 
its competitors, including the counterclaimants, ""by every means available, including the submission of complaints, petitions, 
testimony and other information to various federal governmental agencies and officials, federal courts, and the United States 
Congress which were based upon sham, false and misleading allegations and information, without regard to the truth or merits 
of the claims made."" The counterclaiming defendants thus invoke the ""sham litigation"" theory of antitrust liability recognized in 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973). The counterclaims are asserted by 
certain of the Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Sharp, Sanyo, and Toshiba defendants. In addition, Sears asserts a counterclaim 
against Zenith based on ยง 43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125, charging that Zenith falsely designated certain of its goods 
as originating in the U.S. instead of as having been manufactured in Asia. "
1357,18," While our evidentiary review will be comprehensive, it will be directed to those aspects of this evidence which are capable of 
creating a genuine issue of material fact or supporting an in limine finding of the existence of sufficient independent evidence of 
a conspiracy among the defendants to permit plaintiffs' conspiracy case to go forward through the use of coconspirator 
declarations. We have ignored background materials such as the plaintiffs' extensive workup identifying the defendants and that 
tracing the history of the technological development of CEP's. We have also omitted factual description of materials excluded by 
our evidentiary rulings because summary judgment motions turn on admissible evidence. We have made some exceptions to 
this approach, however, mainly in the area of ""export references"" in the JFTC materials. We have considered the impact of such 
references, assuming arguendo their admissibility, because of their enormous importance to plaintiffs' case. Neither have we 
included a recitation of the interrelationship, useful for purposes of agency or corporate veil-piercing analysis, between the 
Japanese defendants and their subsidiaries, a point stressed at length in the FPS and final summary judgment briefs, since we 
need not reach those matters herein. Finally, in view of our conclusion on liability, we need not summarize plaintiffs' evidence on 
injury and damage."
1357,19," Because the resolution of certain critical facets of the case is so clear and dispositive, we find it unnecessary to reach three of 
the issues upon which the parties have dwelt most over the years. First, we need not address the defendants' contention that the 
export control arrangements entered into by a number of the defendants, which plaintiffs, during much of this litigation, have 
asserted to constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act, were mandated by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (""MITI"") and hence are immunized from antitrust scrutiny by reason of the doctrines of Act of State and sovereign 
compulsion and the imperatives of international comity. Second, we need not add our ""two cents"" to the ongoing controversy 
over the Areeda-Turner marginal (or average variable) cost theory of predatory pricing. See Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing 
and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697 (1975). Neither need we reach the subject 
matter jurisdiction point raised by Melco though eschewed by all other defendants. See our earlier opinion addressed to that 
issue, 494 F. Supp. 1161 (E.D.Pa.1980)."
1357,20," See discussion at p. 1132, infra. "
1358,21," An observation is also in order about some of the ingredients of this opinion. This is the ninth major opinion we have filed in 
this case since April 14, 1979. These prior opinions total 883 (slip opinion) pages and yet, despite the excellence of the briefing 
by both sides, we have rarely drawn extensively from the parties' memoranda in constructing our opinions. However, in view of 
the vast compass of this opinion, the enormity of the record which we must canvass, and the number of arguments advanced, 
we have drawn from time to time upon the briefs of the parties when, after careful review, we have agreed with the statement at 
issue. Counsel are to be commended upon the excellence of their legal writing."
1358,22," The tenth anniversary of the filing of the first complaint in this case occurred on December 21, 1980. "
1359,23," This notion defendants find far more redolent of competition than of conspiracy. See Part VI.A.2(a) and Part VII.K, infra. "
1360,24," The Six Company Case was a price-fixing case brought by the JFTC against six of the Japanese manufacturing defendants in 
this litigation, but which was terminated without disposition. We described this case in detail in our Japanese Materials 
Evidentiary Opinion, PTO 295, 505 F. Supp. 1190 at 1209 n.2. We discussed at length in that opinion the evidence from the Six 
Company Case which is proffered by plaintiffs in this litigation, and held that virtually all of it was inadmissible here. See Part 
VII.G., infra. "
1361,25," See PTO 113 at 33 (statement of Edwin P. Rome). Indeed, at one point, when the case was pending in the District of New 
Jersey, plaintiffs actually moved for summary judgment based upon these arrangements alone, but later withdrew that motion."
1361,26," That is plaintiffs' first brief addressed to a motion for summary judgment. Twenty of the 29 pages in the Statement of Facts 
contained in that brief are devoted to a description of the activities of the so-called conspiratorial groups the Okura, Palace, 
Tenth Day, and Twentieth Day Groups, the Statistics Committee of the EIAJ, and the TV Export Council. The activities of these 
groups, extracted mostly from the JFTC documents, were said to prove both the home market and export conspiracies. The 
remaining 9 pages are devoted to the activities of the ""cartel"" in the U.S. (with emphasis on Melco) and to the alleged effects of 
the conspiracy on plaintiffs and the U.S. industry. "
1362,27," Private label customers are retailers, such as Sears, Roebuck or J.C. Penney, who put their own label on the Japanese TV 
receiver. OEM customers are U.S. TV manufacturers, such as Motorola or GE, who put their label on a Japanese TV receiver of 
a size or model that they do not make or need more of (usually due to a shortage in production capacity, but sometimes for other 
reasons)."
1362,28," By this formulation plaintiffs may possibly have conceded sub silentio a massive portion of their case, for there is no evidence 
of rebates for any sales other than those to private label or OEM purchasers. At the very least, plaintiffs' claims of illegal 
collusive conduct concerning sales of defendants' branded products which in Matsushita's case were a large percentage of total 
sales to the U.S. from 1968-1977 and which in Sony's case represent its entire U.S. sales are undermined. However, because 
plaintiffs have advanced other theories which might be argued to support their non-private label/OEM claims, we do not consider 
them abandoned and will deal with them in this opinion."
1362,29," We note however that in two post-final summary judgment argument submissions, the plaintiffs relied upon the conspiratorial 
meetings as extremely important. In one submission plaintiffs referred to the diaries of the Japanese executives seized by the 
JFTC (and excluded from evidence in our Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion) as the ""Abscam videotapes"" of this case. 
Plaintiffs' Supplemental Post-Argument Memorandum of Sept. 22, 1980 at 211. In the other, they again invoked Mr. Yajima's 
diary and other references to the sub rosa meetings described at length in Part VII.G, infra. "
1363,30," Having tried to the extent we can to explain what plaintiffs' theory is, it is important also to explain what their theory is not. 
Plaintiffs have not alleged a series of individual conspiracies between related companies such as, for example, Toshiba and TAI, 
or MEI, MET, and MECA. Indeed, it is probable that they could not, and still attempt to try all of them together as part of a single 
action. See Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 558, 68 S. Ct. 248, 257, 92 L. Ed. 154 (1947); Kotteakos v. United 
States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946); United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d 603, 621-25 (2d Cir. 
1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 940, 100 S. Ct. 2163, 64 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1980); United States v. Boyd, 595 F.2d 120, 123 (3d Cir. 
1978); United States v. Continental Group, Inc., 456 F. Supp. 704, 716 (E.D.Pa.1978), aff'd, 603 F.2d 444 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1032, 100 S. Ct. 703, 62 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1980). While these cases all arose in the criminal context, they 
establish that, when the evidence shows no common, overriding goal or purpose among the various defendants in a conspiracy 
case, but instead is probative of multiple, discrete conspiracies with individual ends, those actions may not be tried 
simultaneously when substantial rights of the defendants might be affected. We shall not subject the evidence herein to the kind 
of analysis which would be required if plaintiffs were asserting such an approach. It is at all events too late to do so because of 
the strictures of PTO 154, see Part III, infra. "
1364,31," For example: (1) there are hundreds of pages describing the corporate hierarchy of each defendant; and (2) several of the 
voluminous appendices are devoted merely to listing the dates of meetings of various groups and associations to which various 
defendants belonged and the names of corporate officials who attended these meetings. These matters are not in dispute."
1364,32," Given the problems which plaintiffs' FPS ultimately presented, see infra, the parties, after the fact, had some reservations 
about the requirement, as did we, see infra. "
1365,33," Defendants have also filed their counterclaim FPS. The time periods for the filing of the FPS's were staggered, and by order 
several months ago we stayed the requirement for filing response FPS's pending the filing of this opinion."
1365,34," It became our practice to hold pretrial conferences with counsel at least 2 or 3 days per month. This enabled us to rule on 
countless disputes about discovery and other matters without the necessity of written motions. Some of the conferences were by 
telephone conference call, but all conferences were reported and denominated with PTO numbers. A PTO number may thus 
refer to a written order, or it may refer to a transcript of a pretrial conference or hearing at which we made a given ruling, or at 
which a particular argument was advanced."
1365,35," In PTO 116, we had ordered the phased exchange by the parties of translations of documents on which they planned to rely. 
Because of persistent disputes over the quality of plaintiffs' translations, in PTO 143 we appointed two special translation 
masters, Dr. Toshio G. Tsukihira and Dr. Hiroshi Myaji, to resolve such disputes. It soon appeared that there were problems with 
both plaintiffs' and defendants' translations. However Drs. Tsukihira and Myaji did an excellent job in resolving the translation 
difficulties and thereby performed an important service to the Court. We hereby commend them and express our appreciation."
1365,36," We cannot consider documents referenced in the FPS but not found in the depository. When plaintiffs have become aware of 
""missing"" documents, they have asserted that because defendants' paralegals are the ones who used the depository, not 
plaintiffs', the responsibility for missing documents (or translations) must lie with defendants. We have seen no evidence to 
support any claim of neglect by defendants' personnel and shall treat missing documents as plaintiffs' responsibility. Nor do we 
deem it incumbent upon us to call plaintiffs to request copies of missing documents. They have had more than enough time to 
supply them, and it would be disruptive of our work schedule to require us to do so and await the document before proceeding. "
1366,37," Melco moved to strike the evidence aliunde list. While there was much to be said for Melco's position, we declined to do so, 
relying on the then forthcoming pretrial evidentiary hearings and the anticipated labor of reviewing the critical documents as the 
means to flesh out plaintiffs' case."
1366,38," During the first two years of our stewardship in this case, case management was a subject at virtually every pretrial 
conference, and issue definition and contention description were constant topic of dialogue."
1366,39," Letter to the Court from Edwin P. Rome at p. 2 (August 27, 1980)."
1366,40," Plaintiffs have made much of the alleged failure of defendants to move forward in the first instance with their own affidavits. It 
is not true, as plaintiffs suggest, that no defendants have done so. To the contrary, a number of defendants have filed affidavits. 
However, it is plain that a defendant is entitled to move for summary judgment, supported by accompanying memoranda, 
asserting that there is nothing which has been produced in discovery or otherwise which supports plaintiffs' claims. See 
F.R.Civ.P. 56(b) (""A party against whom a claim โฆ is asserted โฆ may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for 
a summary judgment"") and F.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (""โฆ When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in 
this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as 
otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."") We discuss 
standards for summary judgment, including burden of proof issues, in Part V, infra. "
1367,41," Although we had earlier labelled the hearings as ""evidence aliunde hearings,"" we had abandoned that charter in favor of a 
more limited charter, i. e., to aid in the disposition of the summary judgment motions. Then, on the eve of the commencement of 
the hearings, we reversed ourselves and established the scope of the hearings as set forth in the text."
1367,42," The hearings lasted for five weeks, with frequent evening sessions, and it was understood that we would sit as long as 
necessary to receive any additional materials that the parties wished to offer. In addition, at the close of the hearings, we granted 
leave to plaintiffs to submit memoranda on those documents we did not reach during the hearings, as well as leave to submit, in 
connection with both facets of the pretrial evidentiary hearings, as many additional DSS's as they desired. Plaintiffs have made a 
number of submissions and defendants have replied thereto."
1367,43," A sample of the DSS is attached to the Public Records Opinion. Actually, most DSS's contained a number of document 
pages."
1367,44," Frustrated by this stratagem, particularly as it was accompanied by plaintiffs' customary blanket invocation of the entire FPS 
and the documents referenced therein, we offered to sit still longer to review any documents plaintiffs cared to present. See PTO 
291 at 7-11. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiffs, who still declined to delve into specifics. We will discuss the tenor of the plaintiff's summary judgment presentation in Part VII.P, infra. Notwithstanding their lack of 
specificity in the argument, plaintiffs, after its conclusion, submitted an additional list of documents upon which they were relying. 
Moreover, in their 439-page post-hearing brief, which supplemented their 578-page pre-hearing brief, they invoked still other 
documents. The results of our investigation into those documents is instructive and will be described infra."
1367,45," This includes all the documents in the document depository (a rough count suggests well over 50,000)."
1367,46," There are three important ""subtractions"" from the record as thus far enumerated. First, notwithstanding the requirements of 
PTO 116, see n. 35 supra, we have gone to the document depository on numerous occasions to search out a group of 
documents only to find no translation. We fail to understand how plaintiffs can seriously rely upon documents whose translation 
they have not bothered to place in the depository; hence we shall not consider them. Second, we cannot consider documents 
referenced in the FPS but not lodged in the document depository. See n. 36, supra. Third, we shall not consider those 
documents which we have held inadmissible in our evidentiary opinion trilogy. "
1369,47," These included the diaries of Mr. Yajima of Toshiba, Messrs. Yamada and Yamamoto of Hitachi, Mr. Okuma of Melco, and 
Mr. Tokizane of Matsushita."
1369,48, These included the so-called Shimizu Memorandum and various Toshiba internal memoranda. 
1370,49," Five additional expert reports referenced in plaintiffs' FPS were not the subject of dispute during the pretrial evidentiary 
hearings and were not addressed in our Expert Testimony Opinion. These reports are an opinion of Milton L. Davies, Certified 
Public Accountant; an opinion with attachments by Morris J. Cohen & Co., Certified Public Accountant; a report of Walter Lukas, 
Consulting Engineer; a report of Karl Horn and Vito Brugliera, of Zenith Radio Corporation; and an opinion by the Japanese law 
firm of Braun, Moriya, Hoashi & Kubota concerning Japanese commodity tax law."
1370,50," By PTO 305, 505 F. Supp. 1313, dated February 19, 1981, we denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and clarification of 
the expert testimony opinion. That motion was addressed primarily to the admissibility of certain price comparisons in the 
DePodwin Report, described in n.201, infra. "
1371,51," ""Certain Defendants"" is the rubric under which a shifting group of defendants collaborated on briefs. The summary judgment 
motion referenced in the text was filed by the Toshiba, Hitachi, and Sanyo defendants, who generally formed the core of the 
""certain defendants"" group. They were often joined by Sharp, MC, and MIC."
1371,52," The point is more dramatically made if we examine plaintiffs' reply to Melco's motion for summary judgment, filed October 16, 
1978, when discovery was nearly complete, plaintiffs' Preliminary Pretrial Memorandum had been filed, and the case was almost 
eight years old. The principal items listed in plaintiffs' evidentiary review were: (1) the 1957 decision of the JFTC in the Market 
Stabilization Council case; (2) the ""United States Treasury Department Less Than Fair Value"" finding, dumping finding, and CF 
29 assessments against Melco; and (3) the documents seized in the Six Company Case. Yet, all of these items have been 
excluded by the evidentiary opinions."
1371,52," A We will have frequent occasion to observe that many of the documents referenced in the FPS and considered in this opinion 
(but not taken up during the pretrial evidentiary hearings) are similar in character to those excluded in the Japanese Materials 
Evidentiary Opinion. In all such instances, we nonetheless assume the admissibility of those documents arguendo. We believe 
that we fairly could exclude these documents if we were disposed to make formal rulings thereon. In so declaring we do not, we 
think, assert that a party opposing a summary judgment motion must try his case pretrial and establish the admissibility of all the 
documents on which he relies. What we do say is that where, as in this case, the admissibility of these documents is actually, 
and in good faith, challenged, and where a strong showing of inadmissibility is made, the burden of establishing admissibility is 
fairly put on the party opposing the motion. "

1374,54," The Third Circuit has, however, espoused the ""slightest doubt"" test. See pp. 1139-1140 supra. "
1375,55," The courts have also granted directed verdicts at the close of plaintiffs' case when the only evidence presented was 
speculative.  Lisa-Jet, Inc. v. Duncan Aviation, Inc., 569 F.2d 1044, 1048 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 828, 99 S. Ct. 100, 58 
L. Ed. 2d 121 (1978); Shunk v. Bosworth, 334 F.2d 309, 311-12 (6th Cir. 1964). In Lisa-Jet, where the issue was who was at the 
controls when the plane crashed, the court dismissed because the evidence was equally consistent with one theory as with 
another: If the proven facts give equal support to each of two inconsistent inferences, then judgment must go against the party upon 
whom rests the necessity of sustaining one of these inferences. The essential inference cannot be left to conjecture and 
speculation."
1375,569," F.2d at 1048, quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Mondragon, 271 F.2d 342 (8th Cir. 1959). Similarly, in Shunk, where the issue was 
which of two people shot the plaintiff, the court dismissed the case when plaintiff's evidence did not suffice to establish which 
was the guilty one. The court specifically rejected plaintiff's suggestion that defendants should be required to clear up the 
mystery: To hold one of the defendants, or both of them, guilty of negligence in shooting the plaintiff, would only be wild speculation on 
the part of the jury. There is a complete lack of testimony or evidence from which the negligence of the defendant could be 
inferredโฆ. We find no basis or authority in this case for holding the burden of proof shifted from plaintiff to defendant."
1375,334, F.2d at 311-12 (emphasis added). 
1376,56," It has been suggested that what we have before us is not summary disposition at all. Because of the presence of the FPS, in 
which plaintiffs' entire case is set forth with preclusive effect, the record before us on these motions has been said more closely 
to resemble that which is usually before a trial court on a motion for directed verdict under Rule 50(b) than that which is typically 
before the court on a summary judgment motion under Rule 56. Indeed, Melco has already moved for a directed verdict on the 
basis of the preclusive FPS. However, we do not equate the motion before us to a Rule 50 motion and consider the present 
motion under the traditional Rule 56 standards."
1376,57," The parties have engaged in an extensive dialogue on the issue whether, in the absence of other evidence, an expert's 
opinion is sufficient to create a material issue of fact and to thereby defeat summary judgment. Defendants root their argument in 
the requirement of F.R.Civ.P. 56(e) that affidavits opposing a summary judgment motion must be based on ""personal 
knowledge."" An expert opinion based upon secondary sources, even if admissible, to explain or interpret matters bearing upon a 
factual issue, does not, in defendants' view, create that issue. In support of their theory, defendants urge upon us Mapco, Inc. v. 
Carter, 573 F.2d 1268 (Em.App.), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 904, 98 S. Ct. 3090, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1134 (1978); Merit Motors, Inc. v. 
Chrysler Corp., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 569 F.2d 666 (D.C.Cir.1977); Kern v. Tri-State Insurance Co., 386 F.2d 754 (8th Cir. 
1967); and United States v. Johns-Manville Corp., 259 F. Supp. 440 (E.D.Pa.1966). Plaintiffs counter with the Third Circuit case 
of Paton v. La Prade, 524 F.2d 862 (3d Cir. 1975), which they maintain totally undermines defendants' theory. Plaintiffs contend 
that their experts' opinions regarding the existence of a conspiracy are sufficient in and of themselves to defeat summary 
judgment. This dialogue raises interesting questions which have not been definitively determined since enactment of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence. However, because we ruled the critical opinions of plaintiffs' experts inadmissible in our Expert Testimony Opinion ( 
PTO 301, 505 F. Supp. 1313, Dec. 10, 1980), we need not reach this issue. The remaining admissible portions of the expert 
reports the background materials and methodology do not, as will be seen, give rise to an inference of conspiracy."
1376,58," Although not a basis for any decision we make, a word about the other of Pollers twin foci, the notion of complexity, is in 
order. We agree that this case is complex, but we cannot help but observe that plaintiffs' Poller-based argument is at least 
partially ""bootstrapped."" That is because a significant part of the complexity of this case is a function of the plaintiffs having 
referenced some 250,000 documents in their FPS, the vast bulk of which have not even marginal relevance to the case, or at 
least to the core of the case, and many of which have never been translated. "
1377,59, The requirements of proving the relevant product and geographic markets are not at issue in this case.
1377,60," In Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918) (Chicago Board of Trade), 
Justice Brandeis stated what has become the classical formulation of the ""rule of reason"" analysis, which must be undertaken to 
determine whether a particular restraint is unreasonable and therefore unlawful: Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true 
test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or 
whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question, the court must ordinarily consider 
the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the 
nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for 
adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good 
intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to 
interpret facts and to predict consequences. "
1378,61," We shall not discuss the law in terms relevant to the determination whether defendants' activities in the Japanese domestic 
market would, if carried out in the U.S., constitute a violation of the Sherman Act. Rather, what we must enunciate are the 
principles applicable to the ""unitary"" conspiracy averred by plaintiffs and explained in Part II, supra."
1378,62," The Chicago Board of Trade had established a ""call rule"" which required members of the commodity exchange to purchase, 
or offer to purchase, grain ""to arrive"" during off-hours at the same price as the closing bid price of that day's last ""call"" session, 
which immediately followed the regular floor sessions. Although the rule thus ""fixed"" the night and weekend price, it did not fix 
the level of that price, and was upheld by the Court. Justice Brandeis explained that the rule had ""no appreciable effect on 
general market prices"" and that it did not ""materially affect the total volume of grain coming to Chicago."" Instead, it helped to "
1379,," improve market conditions by, inter alia, regulating the exchange's hours of business, limiting the advantage previously held by 
those few dealers doing business at night (thus improving the chances of county dealers and farmers), and making the daytime 
market more perfect. "
1382,63," While there was some hint that Container Corp. might have established such a rule, subsequent Supreme Court cases 
explicitly dispelled the suggestion. See discussion at pp. 1152-1153, infra. "
1384,64," We do not read the Court's statement in Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC, 440 U.S. 69, 80, 99 S. Ct. 925, 933, 59 L. 
Ed. 2d 153 (1979), that ""the court has held that the exchange of price information by competitors violates the Sherman Act,"" 
citing Container Corp. as stating a per se rule. It is plain that some exchanges of information do indeed violate the Sherman Act."
1384,65," The case might be read to say that liability can rest upon a showing of anticompetitive effect, without proof of anticompetitive 
purpose, at least in an oligopolistic industry. See U. S. Gypsum, supra, 438 U.S. at 446, n.22, 98 S. Ct. at 2878, n.22. And 
Container Corp. can perhaps be harmonized with the earlier cases by noting Justice Douglas' use of the language quoted 
above: ""The inferences are irresistible that the exchange of price information has had an anticompetitive effect in the industry."" 
393 U.S. at 337, 89 S. Ct. at 512. This language can be viewed as analogous to the distinction drawn in Maple Flooring to the 
effect that American Column and American Linseed were situations where the activity ""necessarily"" implied illegal conduct. 
While Container Corp. focused on the anticompetitive effect and the earlier cases had drawn inferences of anticompetitive 
purpose, it may be that together they could be interpreted as saying that when the conduct or effect cannot be otherwise 
explained, an anticompetitive agreement can be inferred from exchange of detailed current price information. "
1386,66," The court stated: ""Such individual sales contracts, negotiated at arm's length without knowledge on the part of the purchasers 
of the prices being charged others similarly situated, cannot be regarded as contracts or combinations in restraint of trade. While 
the individual contracts may have been illegal under Pennsylvania law, they were not illegal under the antitrust laws."" 463 F.2d 
at 476. See also Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., 405 F.2d 319 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 999, 89 S. Ct. 1595, 22 
L. Ed. 2d 777 (1969). "
1387,67," In Pennington, a coalition of mine operators and a miners' union successfully persuaded the Secretary of Labor to establish 
higher minimum wages for employees of smaller coal companies, in an effort to reduce competition in the industry. The Court 
held that this kind of activity was not subject to the Sherman Act regardless of whether the association had purposefully 
conducted its activities to cause an anti-competitive effect. "
1388,68," We note that certain defendants have filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that plaintiffs have engaged in sham litigation, 
thus invoking the theory of antitrust liability recognized in California Motor Transport Co., supra, and in Otter Tail Power Co. v. 
United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973). "
1389,69," In the Sound Ship case quoted in Van Dyk, the Third Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment against a Sherman Act 
plaintiff solely because plaintiff failed to bring forward any evidence to support its allegation of a causal link between the alleged 
antitrust violation and its alleged damages.  533 F.2d at 98-100."
1389,70," In Van Dyk, supra, the Court of Appeals did not use the term ""standing,"" but rather spoke in terms of ""causation"" or ""fact of 
injury."" Nor did the Supreme Court in Brunswick, supra, which spoke in terms of ""antitrust injury."" Traditionally, however, proof of 
causal nexus between an alleged antitrust violation and injury resulting therefrom has been considered an aspect of plaintiff's 
standing under ยง 4. See 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law PP 334-35 (1978). Many courts do use ""standing"" terminology. 
See, e.g., Bowen v. New York News, Inc., 522 F.2d 1242 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 936, 96 S. Ct. 1667, 48 L. Ed. 
2d 177 (1976). It is of course true, as the Third Circuit has noted, that statutory antitrust standing is analytically distinct from 
constitutional Article III standing.  Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 447 n.6 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 
98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978). We suspect that the different terminologies may be a function of the differences in 
procedural posture of particular cases, with objections based upon ""standing"" arising at earlier stages of the litigation than those 
based upon lack of injury or causation. The concepts, however, are virtually identical. We use the term ""standing"" herein as a 
synonym for ""fact of injury"" or ""causation of damages."" "
1390,71," The standing issues with respect to these Agreements and Rules arise only under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act. Plaintiffs' claim for 
injunctive relief is moot as it applies to these Agreements and Rules, which are no longer in effect, and there is therefore no 
justiciable claim for injunctive relief under ยง 16 of the Clayton Act. "
1391,72," We came to this conclusion only after much reflection upon plaintiffs' argument that they may attack the Rule because it 
facilitated the coordination of defendants' efforts jointly to penetrate the U.S. market, for there is an initial attractiveness to it. 
Indeed, we found the point troubling and expressed our qualms at oral argument. We conclude, however, that it is plain that in 
purely price terms the Rule must be deemed pro-competitive, that is unless one starts with a (bootstrapping) assumption that the 
Rule is the product of a conspiracy. We note that plaintiffs' ""facilitation"" argument might be plausible if some other potential 
benefit to the Japanese manufacturers could be identified, such as marketing cost-savings from increased efficiency. However, 
plaintiffs have identified no evidence in the record to support such an argument, and we cannot hypothesize such a situation in 
an industry in which, as far as the record shows, competition was by price alone. Plaintiffs have just not elucidated their theory 
with any degree of clarity. We deal further with this point at p. 1213, infra. "
1392,73," The defendants have not challenged the plaintiffs' standing to attack concerted rebating practices maintaining, however, that 
no such concerted scheme for rebating existed. "
1394,74," While the court refused to accept plaintiff's position, it also refused defendants' motion to summarily dismiss the Wilson Tariff 
Act claim, so long as plaintiff was still able to prove a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act."
1394,75," See generally Kintner and Joelson, An International Antitrust Primer 16 (1974): ""The statute (the Wilson Tariff Act) has had 
little independent use and has, as we have seen, been utilized primarily to accompany Sherman Act allegations."" See also L. 
Sullivan, supra, at 714 n.2."
1394,76," See U. S. v. Sisal Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927) (government application for an injunction against 
companies conspiring to increase the price of sisal on the U.S. market was sufficient to allege a cause of action under both the 
Sherman and Wilson Tariff Acts); U. S. v. General Dyestuff Corp., 57 F. Supp. 642 (S.D.N.Y.1944) and U. S. v. General Electric 
Co., 80 F. Supp. 989 (S.D.N.Y.1948) (indictment alleging purpose of conspiracy was to restrain import trade in violation of the 
Sherman Act was also sufficient to allege a violation under the Wilson Tariff Act, despite the lack of a specific allegation of actual 
intent)."
1394,77," See Reliable Volkswagen Sales Service Co. v. Worldwide Automobile Corp., 182 F. Supp. 412 (D.N.J.1960) (failure to state a 
claim under the Sherman Act constitutes failure to state a claim under the Wilson Tariff Act); Fosburgh v. California & Hawaiian 
Sugar Refining Co., 291 F. 29 (9th Cir. 1923) (contracts for the sale of sugar between a refiner and a candy manufacturer which 
agreed to use the sugar only for its own manufacturing needs held not to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act and therefore also 
not the Wilson Tariff Act). "
1395,78," Briefly, plaintiffs' Sherman Act ยง 2 claims depend upon their establishing conspiracy because they do not claim that any 
defendant individually monopolized or attempted to monopolize, but only that the defendants conspired to monopolize and 
collectively monopolized or attempted to monopolize relevant markets. Zenith's Clayton Act and Robinson-Patman Act claims 
require proof of conspiracy because, inter alia, plaintiffs have alleged no separate damages from the Clayton or Robinson-
Patman violations which they charge the defendants with having committed, except for the damages which they claim to have 
incurred as a result of the alleged conspiracy as a whole. NUE has advanced no domestic Clayton Act or Robinson-Patman 
claims. In addition, Zenith has sought to establish the liability of all the members of the purported conspiracy for Clayton Act ยง 7 and 
Robinson-Patman Act violations committed by one or more of the members of the conspiracy, under the doctrine of vicarious 
liability of coconspirators which it finds in Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946). This 
point is discussed in Part VI.D.5, infra."
1395,79," Of course, a private treble damage plaintiff must show that he was injured in his business or property by reason of the 
violation in order to have standing to bring an action.  15 U.S.C. ยง 15. See Part VI.B, supra. "
1400,80," During oral argument, plaintiffs relied on United States v. Tiche, 424 F. Supp. 996 (W.D.Pa.), aff'd mem., 564 F.2d 90 (3d Cir. 
1977), where the District Court, stating its findings after a bench trial, said that slight evidence may be sufficient to connect a 
defendant with a conspiracy, relying on United States v. Kates, supra. Tiche was decided prior to the Third Circuit opinion in 
Cooper. "
1401,81," The essential difference between summary judgment and a directed verdict is the unavailability of demeanor evidence at the 
summary judgment stage. See 6 Moore's Federal Practice P 56.04(2); Currie, Thoughts on Directed Verdicts and Summary 
Judgments, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 71, 79 (1977). The inferences which plaintiffs would propose to the trier of fact in this case have 
nothing to do with demeanor evidence. "
1404,82," Thus Bogosian states the general principle that the circumstances under which the conduct occurred must make the 
inference of rational independent choice less attractive than that of concerted action while Venzie refined that principle by 
specifying two particular circumstances that would generally be critical to a determination of conspiracy based upon parallel 
conduct. "
1405,83," Judge Sloviter dissented in Sweeney, largely on the basis that in her view the plaintiff had elicited enough evidence of 
Texaco's acting in contradiction of its own independent economic interests to require the issue to be submitted to the jury.  637 
F.2d at 128-29. She did not disagree with the majority's statement of the law on proof of interdependence, however, and even 
commented that evidence of actions in contradiction to the actor's independent self-interest is ""the key to reconciliation of the 
(Supreme) Court's decisions in Interstate Circuit and Theatre Enterprises."" Id. at 129. "
1406,84," The same principles will control our determination under F.R.E. 104(a) as to whether the plaintiffs have made a sufficient 
showing of conspiracy to permit their coconspirator hearsay statements to be admissible against alleged coconspirators under 
F.R.E. 801(d)(2)(E). If the plaintiffs have not met the Bogosian/Venzie test by the relevant quantum of evidence aliunde, then the 
principles of inference which we have explained will bar us from accepting evidence of parallel conduct as proof of conspiracy."
1406,85," ""The Matsushita Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum on Vicarious Liability, Submitted in Support of Their Motions for 
Summary Judgment on Zenith's Section 7 and Robinson-Patman Act Claims,"" dated July 3, 1980. The arguments contained in 
this brief are endorsed and adopted by the other defendants."
1406,86," The memorandum distinguishes Winkler-Koch Engineering Co. v. Universal Products Co., 79 F. Supp. 1013 (S.D.N.Y.1947), 
which purportedly announced the principle that ""co-conspirators are vicariously responsible for acts committed in furtherance of 
the joint venture,"" on the ground that it actually applied an evidentiary rule but confused it with one determinative of substantive 
liability. "
1407,87," Nashville Milk Co. v. Carnation Co., 238 F.2d 86, 88 (7th Cir. 1956), aff'd, 355 U.S. 373, 78 S. Ct. 352, 2 L. Ed. 2d 340 
(1958)."
1407,88," Defendants premise this argument on their interpretation of the holding of Nashville Milk, see n. 87, supra, that in view of the 
drastic nature of the treble damages remedy and Congressional silence, no private right of action lies against those responsible 
even as primary violators of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. In defendants' submission, to infer such a right to proceed against 
those alleged to be secondarily liable for violations of other provisions of the same statute would violate the ""most basic 
principles of statutory construction and subvert the overall legislative scheme."" The problem with this argument is that in 
Nashville Milk, the court actually held that there is no private right of action under ยง 3 of the Robinson-Patman (not Clayton) Act, 
15 U.S.C. ยง 13a. That holding followed from the court's determination that ยง 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, unlike ยง 1, did not 
amend the Clayton Act and therefore was not among the ""antitrust laws"" within the meaning of ยง 4 of the Clayton Act which 
private parties have standing to enforce. "
1408,89," In the Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion, 505 F. Supp. 1190 at 1213, we reserved the determination of the 
admissibility of coconspirator hearsay statements."
1408,90," See also Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion at 1229-1230, where we addressed the question whether the admissibility 
of hearsay under the hearsay exceptions is considered under Rule 104(a) or 104(b). We concluded that Rule 104(b) does not 
apply as it, by its terms, applies ""when the relevancy of evidence depends on the fulfillment of a condition of fact."" Hearsay 
exceptions do not generally raise questions of relevancy conditioned on fact. Accordingly, we determine the admissibility of 
evidence under the hearsay exceptions, including coconspirator hearsay declarations, under F.R.E. 104(a)."
1408,91, Rule 801(d)(2)(E) provides in relevant part: (d) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if โฆ (2) Admission by party opponent. The statement is offered against a party and is โฆ (E) A statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
1408,92," A number of circuits concur with the Third Circuit's position and a number of others do not. For a comprehensive discussion of 
this area of the law, see Saltzburg & Redden, supra, 462-69, 1980 Cum.Supp. at 200-04. "
1409,93," For a full discussion of this question, including citation of cases following the preponderance test, see Saltzburg and Redden 
at 462-69. There is an interesting problem posed by the preponderance test. It is clear that a judge can make legal sufficiency rulings under 
various federal rules which result in the removal of matters from the consideration of the jury. However, where the judge 
assumes the role of fact-finder at the preliminary stage and makes rulings predicated in part on credibility judgments (using the 
same standard which a jury would subsequently use), it is arguable that a judicial determination, based partly on credibility 
judgments, that evidence which could be sufficient to meet a prima facie standard did not meet the preponderance test, might 
violate the Seventh Amendment rights of the proponent of the coconspirator statement which is thus excluded (possibly resulting 
in the demise of his conspiracy case). Fortunately we need not decide this difficult issue, for we have found that the plaintiffs 
have presented no genuine issue of material fact, thus dictating the 104(a) result and obviating the problem. While we shall 
make an independent decision on the F.R.E. 104(a) determination, it does not turn on credibility matters. "
1410,94," This approach is, of course, subject to our discussion in Part VI.D.4 relating to inferring conspiracy from parallel conduct."
1410,95," This evidentiary review will deal almost exclusively with documents, because the significant aspects of plaintiffs' case are 
based almost exclusively upon documentary evidence."
1410,96," On two occasions during the final summary judgment argument, Joel Harris, one of Matsushita's counsel, had a team of 
lawyers working in the depository late into the night in an attempt to locate documents which the plaintiffs had invoked the day 
before as being important to their case, only to find that they were either not in the depository or were untranslated from the 
Japanese. "
1411,97," Major treatises on the history of the television industry mention no specific Japanese scientific contributions to early television 
development."
1411,98," We are treated in this segment to such interesting historical tidbits as the following: (1) magnetic recording was first 
accomplished in 1899 by a Danish engineer named Vladimir Poulsen, whose invention, the telegraphone, won a Grand Prix at 
the Paris Exposition in 1900; (2) in 1935 the German firm of Telefunken made the first modern tape recorder; (3) RCA was 
incorporated by GE in 1919 as its subsidiary operating in the radio field; and (4) by 1930 RCA had the exclusive rights to 
manufacture and sell under approximately 4,000 patents in the radio field."
1411,99," E. g., plaintiffs have also offered a series of press clippings which demonstrate the chronology of the introduction of personal 
size television receivers in the United States market from various sources. "
1412,100," See Expert Testimony Opinion at 505 F. Supp. 1313 at 1337, 1363, 1364-1366, 1371-1372, 1378."
1412,101," According to the Nehmer Report, Japanese tariffs, unlike those of the U.S., include freight and insurance in dutiable value."
1412,102, We are informed that discriminatory shipping rates result in freight costs to Japan roughly twice those from Japan.
1412,103," The Japanese commodity tax is calculated as a percent of the c. i. f. (cost plus insurance plus freight) price, plus tariff 
charges."
1412,104," During the latter half of the 1960's, the Japanese government required an import deposit in the amount of 5%. The rate 
dropped to 1% for the final months of its imposition. No interest was paid on the deposit unless the deposit was made in cash. 
Thus potential importers were required to commit capital for the privilege of doing business in Japan."
1412,105," This policy requires that imports be paid for within four months, while domestic competitors are permitted to sell on a 
deferred-payment basis. While exceptions may be made, such exceptions are entirely within MITI's discretion."
1412,106," Until 1967, foreign investment was virtually prohibited. Thereafter, until 1976, foreign ownership could not exceed 25% of the 
total equity issued by an existing Japanese corporation, and no single foreign investor could acquire more than 10% of total 
equity. While 100% foreign ownership of both existing and new Japanese companies is now permitted in theory, the red tape "
1413,," and paperwork are frequently insurmountable obstacles, and approval is discretionary. Moreover, no foreign manufacturer may 
establish more than ten wholly-controlled retail outlets."
1413,107," The combined result of these measures is that a U.S. exporter of color television receivers must bear charges in the amount 
of approximately 30% of the f. o. b. U.S. price; the corresponding figure for a Japanese manufacturer exporting to the U.S. is 
only approximately 10%. After analyzing the history of Japanese tariff and commodity tax rates for other CEP's, Nehmer 
concludes that for most years the result is a ""compounded rate of financial burden which is substantially in excess of 20 
percent."" He notes in addition that ""a tariff of over 20 percent ad valorem is a serious obstacle to trade when added to the natural 
protection created by distance, difficulties of communications and marketing and foreign languages and customs,"" quoting G. 
Patterson, Deputy Director General of the G.A.T.T., Current GATT Work on Trade Barriers, in Vol. I, Compendium of Papers 
Submitted to the Commission on International Trade and Investment Policy 27 (1971)."
1413,108," Some of the companies continued to use the pre-dissolution names, such as ""Mitsui,"" ""Sumitomo,"" ""Mitsubishi,"" and others."
1413,109," Within the category of horizontal keiretsu there are two primary types, characterized by the institution at the center. A kinyu 
keiretsu, or financially linked group, is a fairly weakly joined group which revolves around a bank and which includes a trading 
company. Member companies generally obtain their financing through the member bank and sell their products through the 
member trading company. While members need not deal solely with one another, they tend at least to refuse to deal with 
competitors of member companies. The second, more strongly-linked type of horizontal keiretsu is a sangyo keiretsu, or industrially-linked group, with a major 
manufacturing company at its core. In this type of group the central company is usually the main or only buyer of the products of 
the others, thus exerting considerable control. In many cases, the central company of a sangyo keiretsu is itself a member of a 
kinyu keiretsu, and reaps the benefits of that association on behalf of all its satellite companies. Cohesiveness of these groups is maintained through a variety of mechanisms. One of the most visible such mechanisms is, in 
Yamamura's submission, the formation of presidents' clubs, which meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of mutual interest. 
According to Yamamura, solidarity is also reinforced through mutual shareholding among the members and through interlocking 
directorships. "
1414,110," Vertical keiretsus are essentially domestic marketing systems, in which a product manufacturer totally controls its distribution 
network. Retail outlets are generally associated with a single manufacturer. Territorial restrictions, by which retailers may 
purchase only from designated wholesalers, are common. See generally Haley Report."
1414,111," For example, a keiretsu bank would not finance an entry into the market by a competitor of one of its associated companies; 
a trading company will not help import products of competitors; and a foreign company will be unable to develop a distribution 
network. In short, keiretsu constitute a substantial barrier to foreign entry into the Japanese market. "
1415,112," These manufacturers are Hitachi, Matsushita, Melco, Sanyo, Sharp (formerly Hayakawa), Sony, and Toshiba. Similar 
arrangements existed during various periods with respect to radio receivers and tape equipment. These arrangements are 
discussed in Part VIII, infra, relating to non-TV products. "
1416,113," We will discuss in Part VII.G.4, infra, the record with respect to the meetings and activities of the JMEA and its committees, 
and also its role in the alleged conspiracy. Our discussion here is limited to the JMEA export control rules."
1416,114," And, as we have also noted in Part II, at other times plaintiffs have contended that the ""heart"" of the conspiracy was an 
alleged agreement to violate the minimum-price agreements by granting secret rebates. See Part VII.L, infra."
1416,115," We will consider the Rationales to the Manufacturers' Agreements and JMEA Rules in our discussion of plaintiffs' ""intent"" 
evidence, Part VII.I, infra. Our discussion here is concerned only with the operative provisions of the Agreements and Rules."
1416,116," The first agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A, contained a slightly different Article 8, which merely 
empowered the Television Export Council to set minimum export prices with the approval of MITI, for goods specified in the 
attached Schedule 2. Subsequent agreements listed, in the attached Schedule 2, the minimum prices thus set. "
1417,117," As with the Manufacturers' Agreements, there are slight variations in the JMEA Rules from year to year. For example, the 
first version of the Rules, attached hereto as Appendix B, applies only to black-and-white television receivers, while all 
subsequent versions apply to color television receivers as well. The Rules adopted December 18, 1966, and all subsequent 
versions, apply to exports to Canada as well as to the U.S. Except as indicated in the text, we find these variations insignificant 
for the issues before us."
1417,118," The plaintiffs contend that JMEA prohibited two members from selling to the same U.S. customer, citing one of the 
""Guidelines for Registration"" attached to the 1973 Rules. See FPS at 5221. However, plaintiffs have identified no evidence in the 
record to indicate that this guideline existed prior to January 1, 1973, or that it was ever enforced. In fact, even according to 
plaintiffs' expert Dr. DePodwin's analysis of the record, several of the defendants did share the same customers, and registered 
those customers with the JMEA, during a number of years including 1973. DePodwin Report at V-54. "
1418,119," Customers were registered by defendants pursuant to the Five Company Rule by filing a ""Form 2"" with the TV Export 
Council. In the words of William H. Roberts, Esq., one of the lead counsel for the plaintiffs, defendants produced literally ""barrels 
of them"" (PTO 291 at 134) to plaintiffs during discovery."
1418,120," Additionally, a number of the signatories to the Manufacturers' Agreements (Sony Corp. was the only exception) listed a 
trading company, such as C. Itoh and Co., Ltd., as one of their customers. As plaintiffs' FPS clearly establishes, each of these 
trading companies in turn sold to hundreds of customers in the United States market."
1418,120, A See also discussion at 1213 infra. 
1420,121," The MITI statement was transmitted to the court with a cover letter dated June 9, 1975, from Phillip R. Trimble of the U.S. 
Department of State. The statement had earlier been transferred to the Department of State by the Embassy of Japan along with 
a diplomatic note dated April 25, 1975, requesting that the Department of State transfer the statement to this court. Although the 
original MITI statement was unsigned and unsealed, a formal seal for the statement and verifying affidavits were subsequently 
supplied. For several years, it was unclear whether the MITI statement represented the views of the Japanese government as a foreign 
sovereign, or only the views of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry a distinction which may be of some significance 
for the act of state, sovereign compulsion, and comity defenses. The dispute between the parties on this point was resolved by a 
letter to us dated July 11, 1980 from Yoshio Okawara, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan, which stated 
that ""MITI was and is empowered and authorized to act for the Government of Japan in making the statement as attached to the 
Note Verbale dated April 25, 1975 which was delivered to the Department of State of the United States by the Embassy of 
Japan."" Plaintiffs moved to strike Ambassador Okawara's letter on the grounds that it was sent directly to us through the U.S. mail, 
instead of being forwarded through diplomatic channels. They argued that the court may not give any weight to a communication 
from a foreign government unless it is transmitted by the U.S. Department of State, citing, e.g., The Navemar, 303 U.S. 68, 58 S. 
Ct. 432, 82 L. Ed. 667 (1938); Civil Aeronautics Board v. Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane, 328 F. Supp. 759 (E.D.N.Y.1971); United 
States v. Anchor Line, Ltd., 232 F. Supp. 379 (S.D.N.Y.1964). Plaintiffs also suggested that the letter should be excluded 
under F.R.E. 403. We denied plaintiffs' motion to strike Ambassador Okawara's letter, PTO 298 (Oct. 20, 1980), because it is no longer the policy 
or practice of the U.S. government that statements or positions of foreign governments regarding pending litigation be submitted 
through the Department of State. Rather, the current policy is for foreign governments to submit their views directly to the court 
where the litigation is pending. This practice was changed in 1978 in response to a suggestion of the Clerk of the United States 
Supreme Court. At the present time, statements of foreign governments regarding litigation pending in the United States Supreme Court or the 
United States Courts of Appeals are to be made by means of a brief amicus curiae. See 73 Am.J. Int'l L. 124 (1979). With 
respect to federal trial courts, the Department of State has announced that it does not, in general, expect to transmit diplomatic 
notes to such courts either, but may do so on a case-by-case basis.  73 Am.J. Int'l L. 678 (1979). We can discern no reasons for 
requiring diplomatic transmittal of Ambassador Okawara's letter in this case. In order to promote consistent practice as between 
courts on the appellate and trial levels, we think that, in general, the views of foreign governments should be communicated 
directly to the district court where the litigation is pending. Since there is no equivalent of an amicus brief in the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, and since the Japanese government's statement is only two double-spaced pages in length, we think it entirely 
appropriate for that statement to be communicated in a letter to the court. To require the government of Japan to intervene in the 
litigation under F.R.Civ.P. 24, as plaintiffs suggest, would be pointless and wasteful of the court's and the litigant's resources 
when, as here, the statement which the Japanese government wishes to communicate is simple and short. To the extent that the 
decisions cited by the plaintiffs contain statements which can be interpreted to support their position on the admissibility of 
Ambassador Okawara's letter, we view those statements as merely descriptive of then contemporary practice, which has since 
been changed. Furthermore, it should be noted that even prior to 1978, the federal courts apparently did occasionally consider the statements of 
foreign governments when presented directly to the courts by letter. See Puente v. Spanish National State, 116 F.2d 43 (2d Cir. 
1940); United States v. Melekh, 190 F. Supp. 67 (S.D.N.Y.1960). Finally, we find plaintiffs' Rule 403 argument to be patently 
without merit. "
1421,122," On the conclusivity point, defendants cite, inter alia, United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 218-21, 62 S. Ct. 552, 559-561, 86 
L. Ed. 796 (1942); Banco de Espana v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 114 F.2d 438, 443-44 (2d Cir. 1940); The 
Claveresk, 264 F. 276 (2d Cir. 1920); Agency of Canadian Car & Foundry Co. v. American Can Co., 258 F. 363 (2d Cir. 1919); 
D'Angelo v. Petroleos Mexicanos, 422 F. Supp. 1280, 1283-85 (D.Del.1976), aff'd, 564 F.2d 89 (3d Cir. 1977); United States 
v. Melekh, 190 F. Supp. 67, 87 (S.D.N.Y.1960). Plaintiffs dispute defendants' reading of these cases, contending that the cases 
set forth certain minimum standards which a statement must meet in order to be efficacious, such as that it be made by a person 
or agency with the power to interpret the foreign law involved, that there be an affidavit by an Ambassador, or that the statement 
be by the highest and sole authority empowered to issue official legal opinions. None of these are met, in plaintiffs' submission, 
in the case of the MITI note. See also In Re Muir, 254 U.S. 522, 41 S. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed. 383 (1921); Sullivan v. State of Sao 
Paulo, 122 F.2d 355 (2d Cir. 1941); The Rogdai, 278 F. 294 (N.D.Cal.1920); Lamont v. Travelers Insurance Co., 281 N.Y. 362, 
24 N.E.2d 81 (1939)."
1421,123," The act of state doctrine provides that ""(e)very sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other 
sovereign state, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its 
own territory."" Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U.S. 250, 252, 18 S. Ct. 83, 84, 42 L. Ed. 456 (1897). Thus, a U.S. court cannot 
entertain any action that calls into question the validity of conduct or policies of a foreign government acting within its "
1422,," sovereignty. The degree of foreign government entanglement which must be present to invoke the act of state doctrine varies 
with the circumstances of individual cases. See, e.g., Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, 96 S. Ct. 
1854, 48 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 84 S. Ct. 923, 11 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1964); 
Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 38 S. Ct. 309, 62 L. Ed. 726 (1918); Ricaud v. American Metal Co., 246 U.S. 304, 
38 S. Ct. 312, 62 L. Ed. 733 (1918); Underhill v. Hernandez, supra; Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F.2d 68 (2d Cir. 1977), cert.

1261 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 950, 93 S. Ct. 272, 34 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1972). Plaintiffs cite a number of cases in which 
courts have determined that the doctrine should not be applied. See, e.g., Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 
1287 (3d Cir. 1979); Industrial Investment Development Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., 594 F.2d 48 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 
903, 100 S. Ct. 1078, 63 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1980); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1976); United 
States v. The Watchmakers of Switzerland Information Center, Inc., 1963 Trade Cases P 70,600 (S.D.N.Y.1963). It is the 
application of these cases to the factual pattern before us that the parties dispute. The sovereign compulsion defense rests upon similar reasoning. Although the actions of a private party are at issue rather than 
actions of the sovereign itself, as in the act of state doctrine, the defense is applicable when those private actions were 
compelled by the sovereign. See Interamerican Refining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 1291 (D.Del.1970). 
Again, the parties' dispute centers upon application of the relevant cases to the facts before us, with plaintiffs citing, inter alia, 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962); United States v. 
Sisal Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927); and Watchmakers of Switzerland, supra. Finally, defendants assert that even if they fail to persuade the court that plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the act of state or 
sovereign compulsion doctrines, principles of international comity nonetheless require dismissal. See, e.g., Mannington Mills, 
supra, 595 F.2d at 1297-98; Timberlane, supra, 549 F.2d at 613."
1422,124," We also do not reach defendants' contention that the MITI-related export control arrangements do not, given their setting, 
violate the U.S. antitrust laws. Price-fixing and customer-allocation agreements are, in general, per se violations of ยง 1 of the 
Sherman Act. Defendants submit, however, that the specific context of the arrangements involved in this case, i. e., the 
international trade background and the Japanese government involvement, creates significant differences from the factual 
patterns of the cases which announced the per se rules. Defendants thus contend that even if the Manufacturers' Agreements 
and JMEA Rules are not immunized from antitrust attack by reason of the doctrines and principles discussed in the text, those "
1423,," arrangements should not be assessed against a per se standard, but considered under the rule of reason, under which, 
defendants argue, the arrangements should be found reasonable and therefore lawful because of their concomitant political and 
economic benefits to the U.S. "
1432,1," In Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Teamsters Local No. 70, 415 U.S. 423, 439-40, 94 S. Ct. 1113, 1124, 39 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1974), 
the Supreme Court held that HN1[
] ""(a)n ex parte temporary restraining order issued by a state court prior to removal remains 
in force after removal no longer than it would have remained in effect under state law, but in no event does the order remain in 
force longer than the time limitations imposed by Rule 65(b), measured from the date of removal."" Rule 65(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., 
limits the duration of a temporary restraining order such as was issued here to ten days. Justice Tyler issued his ex parte order "
1433,," on March 14, 1981. The parties disagree on the date removal occurred; however, the latest possible day was March 20, 1981. 
Applying Granny Goose and Rule 65(b) to these facts, Justice Tyler's order expired on March 30, 1981 at the latest, which was 
yesterday. Since the order of which the Union complains has already expired, the Union's modification motion is denied as moot."
1433,2," HN2[
] ""Hazantown agreements"" are agreements between a jobber, such as Billy Jack, and a union, whereby the jobber 
agrees to ""farm out"" production only to shops approved or represented by the union. They are named after the jobber involved in 
the case of Danielson v. Joint Board of Coat, Suit & Allied Garment Workers' Union, 494 F.2d 1230 (2d Cir. 1974), in which the 
Court of Appeals for this Circuit held that union picketing to achieve such an agreement is not an unfair labor practice.  Jou-Jou 
Designs, Inc. v. International Ladies Garment Workers Union, 643 F.2d 905, 906 (2d Cir. 1981)."
1433,3," Billy Jack's complaint, while it mentions acts of violence allegedly committed by the Union's pickets, see Complaint at PP 10-
14, is directed at preventing the Union's picketing entirely, and not at controlling the manner in which it is conducted. Perusal of 
the complaint makes it clear that Billy Jack is relying on the purported unlawfulness of the Union's objective, and not any illegality 
of the means by which the Union is seeking to attain its purpose, as the basis for relief. Were Billy Jack's complaint directed at 
the allegedly violent nature of the Union's picketing, rather than at the Union's objective of securing a Hazantown agreement with 
Billy Jack, the case before the Court would be entirely different. It is clear that federal labor law does not preempt state law to the 
extent state law proscribes violent picketing. UAW v. Russell, 356 U.S. 634, 644, 78 S. Ct. 932, 938, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1030 (1958). 
The Court's holding in the present case, depending as it does on a finding that the state law upon which Billy Jack relies has 
been preempted by federal labor law, would thus be different were Billy Jack's request for relief based on the violence that 
allegedly attended the Union's picketing. Cf. Jou-Jou Designs, Inc. v. Local 23-25, International Ladies Garment Workers Union, 
No. 80 Civ. 1782, Transcript at 70-72 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 1980) (remanding action to state court on ground that complaint sought 
relief from violent picketing, and that case thus did not involve a ""labor dispute"" within meaning of federal labor laws). Since, 
however, Billy Jack's complaint challenges the picketing on the basis of its purportedly unlawful object, the Court views Billy 
Jack's allegations of violence, made in the complaint and in other papers before the Court, to be irrelevant to the Court's 
disposition of the motion to remand. "
1434,4," While the Union relies on 28 U.S.C. ยง 1337 as the basis for original federal court jurisdiction over this action, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 
seems to provide an equally satisfactory ground, particularly in light of the recent amendment of that section to remove the 
amount in controversy requirement. See Federal Question Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, Pub.L.No. 96-486, ยง 2, 94 
Stat. 2369 (1980). "
1435,5," Contrary to the Union's suggestion, the complaint clearly does not allege facts sufficient to state an antitrust claim. In Jou-Jou 
Designs, Inc. v. International Ladies Garment Workers Union, supra note 2, the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that 
Hazantown picketing of the type alleged here can be made the object of antitrust attack. In Jou-Jou, as here, the picketing 
sought to replace an existing Hazantown agreement by a new agreement with a different union. The court, assuming arguendo 
that Hazantown agreements are restraints of trade when viewed in isolation, reasoned that the Union's challenged replacement 
effort, ""even if successful, would involve no net restraint of trade, but merely the substitution of one restraint of trade for another."" 
643 F.2d at 910."
1435,6," While, as described infra, the courts are in substantial conflict on this issue, the leading commentators are not, agreeing that 
federal preemption provides a basis for removal, at least where (as here) federal law also provides an arguable basis for relief.

Supreme Court hinted in dictum that it might adopt this rule when it commented that ""(in) the present case โฆ the allowable 
scope of the state claim implicates the federal doctrine of pre-emption,"" and then proceeded to state that ""this interrelationship 
does not create statutory federal question jurisdiction."" However, the Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the decision in the 
Avco case, cited in note 8 infra, wherein the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit applied a contrary rule. In Debevoise v. 
Rutland Railway Corp., 291 F.2d 379, 380 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 876, 82 S. Ct. 123, 7 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1961), the Court of 
Appeals for this Circuit considered, and rejected, an argument that removal was appropriate because application of the state law 
relied upon by plaintiff purportedly ""interfered with the allegedly exclusive federal power over railway labor disputes created by 
the Railroad Labor Act."" Unfortunately, the Debevoise court did not make clear whether it regarded defendant's argument to be 
that the Railway Labor Act itself created an affirmative defense to state law, or whether that act preempted state law and the fact 
of preemption created the defense. Also, subsequent to Debevoise, the court stated that ""(e)ven though the claim is created by 
state law, a case may ""arise under' a law of the United States if the complaint discloses a need for determining the meaning or 
application of such a law."" T.B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 827 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 915, 85 S. Ct.

1437,9," HN9[
] The preemption doctrine has its roots, of course, in the supremacy clause, U.S.Const. art. VI, cl. 2. See Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637, 649, 91 S. Ct. 1704, 1711, 29 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1971); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 63, 61 S. Ct. 
399, 402, 85 L. Ed. 581 (1941). The formulation of the preemption doctrine adopted here rests on a conception of the supremacy 
clause as having a dual character: at times acting as a mechanism for determining the proper body of substantive law to be 
applied to a particular claim, as in preemption analysis; at other times operating as a vehicle for interposing a federal defense to 
a state cause of action, as where application of a state statute is resisted on substantive constitutional grounds. While the 
commentators typically conclude that preemption occurs where the court finds either a congressional design to ""occupy the field"" 
or a conflict between federal and state statutes, see, e.g., Note, The Preemption Doctrine: Shifting Perspectives on Federalism 
and the Burger Court, 75 Colum.L.Rev. 623, 624-26 (1975), in the Court's view the doctrine hinges fundamentally on the 
occupation ground, and the conflict ground exists merely as a proxy for finding the requisite congressional intent to occupy the 
field. "
1438,10, See note 4 supra.
1438,11," In certain cases, Congress has vested ""exclusive federal jurisdiction"" in an instrumentality other than the federal district 
courts. For example, an action alleging unfair labor practices in violation of section 8 of the NLRA is normally (though not, as is 
discussed infra, in the present case) within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (""the NLRB""), 
meaning that both the federal and state courts are without jurisdiction to hear such a case.  Amalgamated Clothing & Textile 
Workers Union v. J.P. Stevens & Co., 475 F. Supp. 482, 486 (S.D.N.Y.1979). Professor Moore suggests that the district court 
should remand, rather than dismiss, such actions, on the theory that ""the first order of business is for the federal court to 
determine its own jurisdiction and, where the federal court itself lacks jurisdiction and so determines, โฆ it should not proceed 
further to decide whether the state court has jurisdiction."" 1A Moore's Federal Practice P 0.169(1), at 556-57 (2d ed. 1979). The 
Court cannot accept this argument, for two reasons. First, given the derivative nature of removal jurisdiction, the Court does not 
see how the federal court's jurisdiction can be enhanced beyond that of the state court, so as to permit dismissal rather than 
remand, merely by the fact that the federal court would have had jurisdiction had the action been commenced in federal court. 
Thus, the same result should pertain in all exclusive federal jurisdiction cases, regardless of how Congress has allocated that 
exclusive jurisdiction among the various federal instrumentalities. Second, Professor Moore's preference for a remand here "
1439,," seems wholly contradicted by the rule, approved by Professor Moore, that the federal court always has jurisdiction to dismiss for 
want of jurisdiction. In short, if dismissal is justified in the ""ordinary"" exclusive federal jurisdiction case, it is no less justified where 
that jurisdiction is vested in an instrumentality other than the district courts."
1439,12," The Union also argues that New York law prohibiting tortious interference with contract has been preempted in cases such as 
this by the federal antitrust laws. In Jou-Jou Designs, Inc. v. International Ladies Garment Workers Union, supra note 2, 643 
F.2d at 910, the Court of Appeals for this Circuit specifically rejected a federal antitrust attack on conduct virtually identical to that 
alleged here. The Union's conduct here is thus not even arguably prohibited by federal antitrust law, meaning that San Diego 
Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959), and its progeny clearly provide no 
basis for finding preemption on this theory. See discussion in text infra. For the reasons discussed in note 13 infra, the 
alternative route to preemption in the federal labor area created by Local 20, Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U.S. 252, 84 S. Ct. 
1253, 12 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1964), also fails to provide a basis for holding that the state law relied upon by Billy Jack has been 
preempted in cases such as this by federal antitrust law. The Union's preemption argument accordingly must stand or fall on 
the federal labor laws."
1439,13," The Supreme Court enunciated a subsidiary route to preemption, for cases where the conduct challenged under state law is 
not either arguably prohibited or arguably protected by federal labor law, with its decisions in Local 20, Teamsters Union v. 
Morton, 377 U.S. 252, 84 S. Ct. 1253, 12 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1964) and Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v. 
Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132, 96 S. Ct. 2548, 49 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1976). Under these cases, 
HN15[
] a finding of preemption is appropriate where the court finds that the absence of federal regulation is indicative of a 
""congressional determination to leave (the challenged conduct) available,"" and that to allow the states to regulate the conduct 
would be ""to upset the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy."" Local 20, 
Teamsters Union v. Morton, supra, 377 U.S. at 260, 84 S. Ct. at 1258. Since the Court concludes infra that the Union's alleged 
conduct here is arguably prohibited by federal labor law, these cases are inapposite to the extent the Union's preemption 
argument is rooted in federal labor law. The Court notes, however, that the Morton-Machinists rule lends support to the Court's 
conclusion infra that the necessity for preemption here lies in the possibility that state law might be applied to prohibit conduct 
that, while arguably prohibited by federal law, is in fact permitted by the NLRA, and thus intended by Congress to be available to 
labor organizations in their dealings with employers. To the extent the Union's argument is based on the federal antitrust laws, 
see note 12 supra, the Court does not find that the silence of the federal antitrust laws on the legality of the Union's conduct is, "
1440,," within the meaning of the Morton-Machinists rule, expressive of a congressional determination to permit such conduct in striking 
the balance of power between labor and management."
1440,14," Professor Cox has helpfully defined HN17[
] laws of general applicability as ""laws that do not rest upon legislative, 
administrative, or judicial evaluation of the several interests of employers, labor unions, employees, and the public in union 
organization, collective bargaining, or a labor dispute."" Cox, Recent Developments in Federal Labor Law Preemption, 41 Ohio 
St. L.J. 277, 293 (1980). He argues that state laws of general applicability should never be subject to preemption where, as here, 
the conduct they purportedly forbid is arguably prohibited (as distinct from arguably protected) by federal labor law. Id. at 281-82. 
However, the Supreme Court has consistently taken the position that the preemption decision does not depend on whether the 
state law in question is of general applicability. See, e.g., New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Department of Labor, 440 
U.S. 519, 533, 99 S. Ct. 1328, 1337, 59 L. Ed. 2d 553 (opinion of Stevens, J.), 557-58 (Powell, J., dissenting). "
1441,15," This case is thus far different from those cases in addition to Sears where the Supreme Court has carved out an ""exception"" 
to Garmon's ""arguably prohibited"" approach. See, e.g., Farmer v. Carpenters Local 25, supra, 430 U.S. at 304, 97 S. Ct. at 1065 
(no preemption where complaint alleged intentional infliction of mental distress) (while challenged conduct was arguably 
prohibited by NLRA, action before NLRB would focus on whether statements were made with discriminatory intent, and not on 
whether statements were made with intent and effect of causing emotional distress); Linn v. Plant Guard Workers Local 114, 383 
U.S. 53, 63, 86 S. Ct. 657, 663, 15 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1966) (no preemption where complaint alleged libel) (while challenged activity 
was arguably prohibited by NLRA, action before NLRB would focus on coercive or misleading nature of the statements rather 
than their defamatory quality). "
1442,16," The Court finds support for the conclusion just reached in Justice Stevens' opinion in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego 
County District Council of Carpenters, supra, the most recent majority opinion of the Supreme Court in this area. Justice 
Stevens, in holding that HN23[
] state regulation of activity arguably prohibited by section 8 of the NLRA cannot avoid 
preemption simply because it is pursuant to a law of general application, noted that the Court had previously held, in 
Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway & Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 296, 91 S. Ct. 
1909, 1922, 29 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1971), that state contract laws were preempted in the federal labor context to the extent they 
purported to govern a union member's rights and duties under the union security clause in the collective bargaining agreement. 
In Justice Stevens' view, ""(permitting) the state court to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a law of general application in these 
circumstances would have entailed a ""real and immediate potential for conflict with the federal scheme.' "" 436 U.S. at 195 n.24, 
98 S. Ct. at 1756 n.10 (quoting Farmer v. Carpenters Local 25, supra, 430 U.S. at 301 n.10, 97 S. Ct. at 1056 n.10). Justice 
Stevens then went on to comment that ""(a)n identical result would undoubtedly obtain were an employer subjected to 
recognitional or secondary picketing to seek injunctive relief in state court on the theory that the union was tortiously interfering 
with his freedom to contract."" 436 U.S. at 194 n.24, 98 S. Ct. at 1756 n.24. The recent decision of the Court of Appeals for this Circuit in Jou-Jou Designs, Inc. v. International Ladies Garment Workers 
Union, supra note 2, does not affect the Court's conclusion that New York law is preempted here. In Jou-Jou, the court held, on 
facts virtually identical to those alleged here, that plaintiff had failed to allege a viable Sherman Act claim. 643 F.2d at 910-11. 
The court then commented that ""(this case) is essentially either a state claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, 
or an NLRB case."" Id. In the Court's view, by this comment the Jou-Jou court was merely indicating some potential avenues for 
similarly situated plaintiffs to explore not providing a road map showing the path to successful litigation. As today's decision 
shows, the particular route chosen by Billy Jack, while not leading to an absolute dead end, as does the one used in Jou-Jou, is 
plainly not the most desirable course to follow in a case such as this."
1442,17," Most section 8 cases are not simply cases of exclusive federal jurisdiction, but are in fact cases within the exclusive original 
jurisdiction of the NLRB. For the reasons discussed in text infra, this is not such a case. Assuming it were, the proper result 
would be for the Court to deny the instant motion to remand, but then to dismiss the action sua sponte without prejudice to its 
being refiled before the NLRB. See note 11 supra. "
1454,1," .  This action was originally filed by Nancy Pollock on behalf of the alleged class.  After a motion by Conti and Waltuch to strike 
the complaint as sham and false, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, was denied (see Opinion and Order dated November 28, 1978), a 
second amended complaint was filed by stipulation dated June 26, 1979, adding Alexander Moskovits as an additional named 
plaintiff.  By stipulation ""so ordered"" on November 27, 1979, consideration of the plaintiffs' motion for class certification was held 
in abeyance pending the outcome of the within motions. "
1457,2," .  Notably, the court found that the application of the antitrust laws in the CEA context was not impliedly repealed by passage of 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act. 468 F. Supp. at 116. "
1458,3," .  As far as the Court is aware, Bucher v. Shumway, 452 F. Supp. 1288 (S.D.N.Y.1978) is the only case in this Circuit to follow 
the rationale of Schaefer.  The plaintiffs in Bucher alleged violations of the securities laws and antitrust laws in connection with a 
""friendly"" tender offer for outstanding shares in a corporation.  Relying upon the rationale of Schaefer, the district court dismissed 
the antitrust claims."
1458,4," .  While there is a dearth of cases directly addressing the question of whether an antitrust claim could be asserted against 
commodity futures brokers and traders, discussions in several Second Circuit cases indicate that such claims were allowed prior 
to the passage of the CFTCA.  E. g., Miller v. New York Produce Exchange, 550 F.2d 762 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 823, 
98 S. Ct. 68, 54 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977); Klebanow v. New York Produce Exchange, 344 F.2d 294, 299-300 (2d Cir. 1965). "
1459,5," .  The creation of an exclusive remedy under the CEA cannot be implied from the legislative history and such an implication 
would be disfavored.  Cf.  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350-51, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 1734, 10 L. Ed. 2d 
915 (1963) (""Repeals of the antitrust laws by implication from a regulatory statute are strongly disfavored, and have only been 
found in cases of plain repugnancy between the antitrust and regulatory provisions."")."
1459,6," .  That is, the Supreme Court has never decided which of the many standing tests (e.g., the direct injury test, Loeb v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 183 F. 704 (3d Cir. 1910); the target area test, Calderone, supra; the foreseeable target area test, Mulvey v. Samuel 
Goldwyn Productions, 433 F.2d 1073 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 923, 91 S. Ct. 1377, 28 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1971); the 
zone of interests test, Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1975)) are permissible under section 4 of the 
Clayton Act. "
1460,7," .  Initially, it should be made clear that this is not a pass-on case to which the holding of Illinois Brick is applicable.  Although the 
plaintiffs and defendants were required to deal through agents, they were in direct contact insofar as they were on opposite 
sides of the November Contracts market.  For a succinct discussion of the mechanics of futures contracts trading, see Leist v. 
Simplot, supra, at 286-88."
1460,8," .  In their sur-reply memorandum of law, at 27 n.*, the plaintiffs assert that, due to the trading mechanism used by the Exchange, 
it would be virtually impossible to ascertain from whom the plaintiffs purchased and to whom the defendants sold. "
1461,9," .  This type of price increase is distinguishable from the ""umbrella"" pricing situation in Mid-West Paper Products, supra. In a 
market in which supply is restricted, prices move up naturally pursuant to basic laws of supply and demand.  In a market in 
which an oligopoly or price fixing arrangement allows a relatively small seller to raise its price to the level protected by the price 
""umbrella"", the small seller is not ""compelled"" to raise his price to the same extent as a seller in a supply restricted market.  
Thus, the severe difficulties attendant with proving damages in an ""umbrella"" pricing situation, which troubled the court in Mid-
West Paper Products, supra, are not present in the case at bar. "
1480,1," In Connell Construction Company v. Plumbers and Steamfitters Local Union No. 100, 421 U.S. 616, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 
2d 418, rehearing denied, 423 U.S. 884, 96 S. Ct. 156, 46 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1975), and in Meat Cutters Local 189 v. Jewel Tea Co., 
381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965), the Supreme Court circumvented the doctrine of primary jurisdiction by 
finding that ""federal courts may decide labor law questions that emerge as collateral issues in suits brought under independent 
federal remedies."" Owing to its characterization of this matter as a labor dispute, this court will not follow such a circuitous route 
of assuming jurisdiction."
1480,2," HN9[
] That section, entitled ""Findings and Policies"" provides, in pertinent part: The denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the 
procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the 
necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the 
instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling 
the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such 
materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to 
impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce."
1480,*," * * * It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the 
free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the 
practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, 
self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and 
conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection."
1480,3," The Connell decision prompted abundant commentary. Included in such discourse are the following statements. ""The most controversial case of the 1974 Term was Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, a 5-4 decision in which the 
court found a novel and puzzling way for depriving labor unions of their general exemption from the antitrust laws."" Bartosic, The 
Supreme Court 1974 Term: The Allocation of Power in Deciding Labor Law Policy, 62 Va.L.R. 533 (1976). ""By distinguishing between the statutory and nonstatutory exemptions for labor union activity, the majority does remove some of 
the confusion surrounding the determination of labor's antitrust exemption; yet the court supplied no specific criteria for the 
nonstatutory balancing test beyond a vague weighing of competing goals."" Paulsen, Labor's Exemption from Federal Antitrust 
Law: The Diminishing Protection for Union Activity, 28 U. of Fla.L.R. 620 (1975). "
1482,4," San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959) and Motor Coach 
Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 91 S. Ct. 1909, 29 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1971) did not involve antitrust claims. These cases' 
importance stems from their recognition of the NLRB's exclusive competence over any activity ""arguably subject"" to ยง 7 or ยง 8 of 
the National Labor Relations Act and, as such, the resulting preemption of state and federal court jurisdiction. "
1483,5," Cf.  Tugboat, Inc. v. Mobile Towing Co., 534 F.2d 1172 (5th Cir. 1976) wherein the Fifth Circuit considered the standing 
requirements relative to an antitrust action. The court held that injury to employment opportunities or to a union's business 
activities would provide sufficient grounds for institution of a Sherman Act and Clayton Act suit upon the requisite showing. The 
complainant must prove that he was in the ""target area"" of the conspiracy and that the injuries to the ""commercial interests or 
enterprises"" were proximately caused by the anticompetitive combination. The Tugboat case, however, offers no dispositive 
guidance to the instant adjudication. That court specifically declined to reach the question of whether the labor regulatory 
scheme would remove the case from antitrust protection.  534 F.2d at 1174."

1490,*," Indeed, in Freeman we specifically noted our awareness that the Federal District Court in the Goldfarb case had reached the 
conclusion that the learned professions are not exempt from regulation under the Federal antitrust laws (355 F Supp 491). We 
expressly declined to follow the Goldfarb holding, however, noting that the question presented in Freeman was strictly a matter 
of the proper interpretation of a State statute ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1, 7, supra).  All that has occurred in the seven years 
since Freeman was decided is the Supreme Court's decision upholding the ruling of the District Court in the Goldfarb case (421 "
1491,," U.S. 773, supra).  That ruling, however, is no more persuasive now on the question of the proper application of the Donnelly Act 
than it was when we first addressed the question in Freeman."
1491,1," (NYS Bar Assn., Section on Antitrust Law, Report of the Special Committee to Study the New York Antitrust Laws [1957].)"
1491,2," Upon consideration of the substantive adequacy of the Donnelly Act, the special committee wrote: ""The Committee finds New York law substantively adequate for the task at hand.  However, in contrasting state and federal law 
one is struck by the verbosity, turgidity and complexity of the New York legislative language.  Were we to start from scratch, in 
order to avoid placing businessmen in the dilemma of having to comply with conflicting standards, we might urge the use of 
identical wording in both state and federal statutes."
1491,*, * * 
1492,," ""But the Donnelly Act has been on the books for close to sixty years and the substitution of Sherman law wording would produce 
more confusion than it would allay.  Moreover, the state decisions seem to rest on the same fundamental concepts as does the 
federal law, and the differences between state and federal jurisprudence are insubstantial.  In the few instances where the state 
law seems to diverge from federal, the state decisions are often generations old.  Should the same issues arise again, they 
would presumably be decided in the light of modern antitrust concepts which have been developed federally. ""For these reasons we find no need for legislative alteration of any of the doctrines developed by the New York courts."" (Report, 
at p 8.)"
1492,3," In earlier cases there had been opinions which intimated that members of the medical profession might be within the ambit of 
the Federal antitrust laws ( United States v Oregon Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326; American Med. Assn. v United States, 317 U.S. 
519). It is worth noting that the report of the special committee in 1957 cites both of these cases in comparing the text of the 
Donnelly Act, which prior to the 1957 revision was couched in terms of described activities with that of the Federal antitrust 
statute, observing that ""[the] Sherman Act, on the other hand, is not limited in application to specific articles or services.  
Advertising, investment banking, insurance, medicine, are all within its reach"" (Report, at p 23a; emphasis added)."
1492,4," Goldfarb and its progeny have firmly established that ""The nature of an occupation, standing alone, does not provide sanctuary 
from the Sherman Act"" (421 U.S., at p 787). Since Goldfarb, the Federal courts have consistently reaffirmed that the professions 
fall within the ambit of the Sherman Act. (See, e.g., National Soc. of Professional Engrs. v United States, 435 U.S. 679; Virginia 
Academy of Clinical Psychologists v Blue Shield of Va., 1980-2 CCH Trade Cases, par 63,395 [4th Cir]; Arizona v Maricopa 
County Med. Soc., 1980-1 CCH Trade Cases, par 63,239 [9th Cir], cert granted 49 USLW 3663; Boddicker v Arizona State 
Dental Assn., 549 F2d 626; Ballard v Blue Shield, 543 F2d 1075.) "
1493,5," Indeed in Freeman we acknowledged that price-fixing arrangements the primary purpose of which would be to produce a 
certain minimum financial reward to individual members of the legal profession might fall into a different category (34 NY2d, at p 
11)."
1493,6," Additionally, it might have been that, at later stages of the criminal action, if the indictment were now to be sustained, a defense 
would have been available under section 15.20 of the Penal Law.  Subdivision 2 provides: ""A person is not relieved of criminal 
liability for conduct because he engaged in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a matter of law, constitute 
an offense, unless such mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in * * * a judicial decision of a 
state * * * court"". "

1523,4," The Court in International Air Industries also set forth an alternative test, that if the defendant's prices are not below its average 
variable costs, then they must be ""below its short-run, profit maximizing price and barriers to entry . . . great enough to enable 
the discriminator to reap the benefits of predation before new entry is possible."" 517 F.2d at 724. We conclude this alternative 
test is inapplicable to the present case, because plaintiff has introduced no evidence as to Hilltop's short-run profit maximizing 
price, and what evidence was presented concerning barriers to entry into the ready-mix concrete industry suggests that they are 
relatively low.  This leaves, according to the International Air Industries Court, only Areeda and Turner's average variable cost 
test for predatory pricing."
1523,5," These factors include the relative cost structures of the alleged predator and victim, whether the alleged predator expands 
output to replace that of excluded rivals or whether it restricts output to raise prices once rivals withdraw, and whether long-run 
compensatory expansion by the alleged predator includes investment in new facilities promoting economies of scale. "
