23,*," The Honorable Terry J. Hatter, Jr., United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation."
23,1," Although the Committee is appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court from a list of nominees chosen by the Bar's Board of 
Governors, it is not, as such, a committee of the State Bar.  Because no specific allegations of wrongdoing have been made 
against the Bar, the dismissal for failure to state a claim was proper as to the Bar.  For the same reason, we affirm the dismissal 
as to the spouses of the individual committee members. "
24,2," Ronwin applied to retake the bar examination in July, 1974, but was denied permission because the Committee declined to 
certify that he was ""mentally and physically able to engage in active and continuous practice of law."" See Ariz.Sup.Ct.R. 
28(c)(IV)(5). A special committee conducted a formal hearing regarding the allegations of mental unfitness under Ariz.Sup.Ct.R. 
28(c)(XII)(D).  After holding a hearing, this special committee declined to find Ronwin mentally fit to practice law. The finding of 
unfitness was affirmed by the Arizona Supreme Court.  Application of Ronwin, 113 Ariz. 357, 555 P.2d 315 (1976),  cert. denied, 
430 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 1178, 51 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1977)."
24,3," On remand, however, it may be necessary to determine the manner in which the 1974 examination was graded. Specifically, 
the court should determine whether the examination was graded as Ronwin alleges, or was graded on a different basis, such as 
a ""scaled"" formula, designed to equalize the difficulty of the exam over various years with the pass-fail determination being 
based on individual merit rather than numerical quota. "
25,4," The challenged policies in Benson v. Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners, 673 F.2d 272, 275-76 (9th Cir. 1982) (as 
amended), in contrast to this case, were explicitly mandated by statute. "
26,5," As in City of Boulder and City of Lafayette, "" this case's preliminary posture makes it unnecessary for us to consider other 
issues regarding the applicability of the antitrust laws in the context of suits by private litigants against government defendants . . 
. [or to] confront the issue of remedies appropriate against [public] officials."" City of Boulder, 102 S. Ct. at 844 n.20. Accord, City 
of Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 401-02, 98 S. Ct. at 1130-31."
26,6," The statement in Brown that ""the only constraints on the states' exclusive jurisdiction [over bar admission matters] are 
constitutional in nature . . .,"" 623 F.2d at 609, refers to § 1343 actions like those at issue in Brown, Hackin, and Chaney because, 
as the Brown court notes in the very next sentence: ""federal courts are granted jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343 to vindicate 
[only] constitutional rights."" This jurisdictional limitation stems from the express language of § 1343, not from the fact that the 
plaintiff was challenging a bar admission policy.  One need look no farther than Goldfarb, where the Court held that the 
minimum-fee schedule enforced by the state bar violated § 1 of the Sherman Act, to see that Ronwin's complaint established 
subject-matter jurisdiction under federal antitrust laws. "
27,," Similarly, a careful reading of the three decisions reveals that they do not hold that a state supreme court is the only proper 
defendant in challenges to bar grading procedures.  As the court explained in Brown, the state supreme court is the proper party 
when it has promulgated the specific challenged rule.  623 F.2d at 608 n.6. In Hackin, as the Brown court noted, the court emphasized that the admission rule at issue, barring graduates of unaccredited 
law schools from taking the bar exam, was directly promulgated and enforced by the state supreme court.  361 F.2d at 500-01. 
In Chaney, the court's discussion clearly concerns finality and the nature of the plaintiff's claim, and has no relevance to the 
issues of state action or proper parties.  See 386 F.2d at 966-67. It should also be noted that the Chaney court discusses the 
plaintiff's restraint of trade contention (similar to Ronwin's claim) at length, and rejects it on factual rather than jurisdictional 
grounds.  Id.  at 965. Thus, these decisions offer no support for the contention that there is a blanket rule making state supreme 
courts the only proper defendants in all bar admissions cases. "
28,7," The Court specifically stated that a party need only show that a defendant's general business, as opposed to the alleged illegal 
conduct, affected interstate commerce in order to meet the jurisdictional requirement.  McLain, 444 U.S. at 242, 100 S. Ct. at 
509."
28,8," Although the Committee on Examinations and Admissions declined to certify that Ronwin was ""mentally fit"" to practice law 
when he applied to retake the bar exam in July, 1974, and the special committee appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court 
upheld that determination on January 21, 1975, it was not until July, 1976 that the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the finding.  
Application of Ronwin, 113 Ariz. 357, 555 P.2d 315 (1976), cert.  denied, 430 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 1178, 51 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1977). 
Defendants do not contend either that Ronwin would have been denied admission in 1974 because of his alleged unfitness to 
practice had he passed the exam or that he would not have been allowed to practice law pending the Arizona court's decision on 
the matter.  It would be inappropriate for this court to speculate on the matter."
28,9," Assuming that Ronwin is able to clear the various hurdles still before him, it may be necessary to determine whether he would 
have passed the bar examination if graded on a proper basis.  If the 1974 bar exam may still be impartially regraded to ascertain 
whether Ronwin would have received a passing grade, but for the alleged improper method of restricting bar admission, the 
district court may so order and supervise such a procedure for the sole purpose of determining whether Ronwin has been 
damaged.  If the court decides that such a remedy is no longer feasible under the circumstances of this case, it would be 
justified in presuming that he would have passed for the purpose of ascertaining damages, if any. The amount of damages 
would be limited to Ronwin's loss of earnings, between April, 1974 when he would have been admitted to the Bar, and July, "
29,1976," , when the Arizona Supreme Court found him unfit to practice law. See Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 658 F.2d 1256, 
1260 (9th Cir. 1981) (special solicitude for proof of damages when defendant's conduct has been a factor in speculative nature 
of damages), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1018, 102 S. Ct. 1713, 72 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1982)."
29,10," 28 U.S.C. § 144 provides: HN5[
] Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the 
judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse 
party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding. The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than 
ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure 
to file it within such time.  A party may file only one such affidavit in any case.  It shall be accompanied by a certificate of 
counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith. Under this section, the district judge must accept the truth of the factual assertions in the affidavit and determine only whether 
the affidavit is legally sufficient.  See United States v. Azhocar, 581 F.2d 735, 739 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 907, 99 
S. Ct. 1213, 59 L. Ed. 2d 454 (1979). HN6[
]  28 U.S.C. § 455 provides, in part, that: (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality 
might reasonably be questioned. (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances: (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. . . . "
30,11," Ronwin's allegation of ex parte communication between the judge and defense counsel was based on the fact that the 
counsel, in setting a hearing date on defendants' motion to dismiss, knew when the judge would be in Phoenix.  According to 
Ronwin, counsel could only have obtained that knowledge through ex parte communications with the judge.  Counsel explained, 
however, that he knew the judge would be in Phoenix on the day he suggested for a hearing because he had received an order 
from the court in another case assigned to the judge setting the same date for a hearing in the other case."
30,12, We note that many of the remaining issues may be suitable for resolution by means of summary judgment.
30,1," The majority has dismissed spouses of the committee members for the perplexing reason that no specific allegations of 
wrongdoing have been made against the spouses. Maj. op., note 1, ante.  However, in Arizona plaintiffs join spouses as 
defendants to reach their community property, not because the spouses are wrongdoers.  A.R.S. § 25-215 requires that a cause 
of action based upon a community obligation be brought against both husband and wife.  Eng v. Stein, 123 Ariz. 343, 599 P.2d 
796 (1979). A community obligation is incurred when, for example, a husband's tort is committed in furtherance of the 
community's interest.  Howe v. Haught, 11 Ariz. App. 98, 462 P.2d 395 (1969). In fact, plaintiff pleaded, ""The male Defendants 
all acted on their own behalves and on behalf of their respective marital communities."" Whether defendants actually acted on 
behalf of their marital communities is a question that the district court did not address and that the majority does not address.  
Since the case is remanded, resolution of this material issue should have been left to the district court.  That plaintiff did not 
specifically allege that defendants' spouses are wrongdoers is wholly immaterial. The majority's expansive interpretation of antitrust law contrasts nicely with its restrictive view of plaintiff's remedies.  The effect 
of dismissing defendants' spouses from the action is that now plaintiff may recover only from the separate property of 
defendants.  See Eng v. Stein, supra, 123 Ariz. at 346, 599 P.2d at 799. "
31,2," In Brown, a graduate of an unaccredited law school sued the Nevada Supreme Court, State Bar, and Board of Bar Examiners 
to allow her to sit for the bar.  The district court dismissed the State Bar and the Board of Bar Examiners as improper parties 
under Hackin, yet issued an injunction against them.  623 F.2d at 608. In allowing the bar and the board to appeal, the court of 
appeals explained: We see no logic in the district court's novel rulings which currently dismissed appellants and yet granted specific relief 
against them.  Whatever the rationale, however, appellants should not be denied appellate review of orders by which they 
are aggrieved. Id. Clearly, the court allowed the two parties to appeal because they were aggrieved.  In dictum, the court said that Hackin, 
involving a challenge to the validity of a state supreme court rule governing admission to the bar, did not apply to make the state 
bar and the board improper defendants, since these were the only parties who could ""physically comply"" with an injunction "
32,," requiring the defendants to let the plaintiff sit for the bar.  Id. at 608 & 608 n.6. Even assuming the correctness of that dictum, it 
has no application to this case.  Ronwin complains not of the failure of the state bar to seat him for the exam -- he failed it -- but 
of the failure of the supreme court to admit him.  Admission to the bar is within the province of the supreme court, not the state 
bar, nor the committee."
32,3," A variety of discretionary practices have been sanctioned by the courts.  Statutes permitting admission without examination are 
valid.  Shenfield v. Prather, 387 F. Supp. 676 (N.D.Miss.1974). A state may validly require an applicant to pass an examination 
in essay form.  Chaney v. State Bar, supra. A state may allow state graduates to waive examination without denying equal 
protection to other applicants.  Huffman v. Montana Supreme Court, 372 F. Supp. 1175 (D.C. Mont.), aff'd., 419 U.S. 955, 95 S. 
Ct. 216, 42 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1974). A board of bar examiners may validly meet to review borderline failure after all scores are 
tabulated.  Hooban v. Board of Governors of Washington State Bar Association, 85 Wash.2d 774, 539 P.2d 686, app. dismissed, 
424 U.S. 902, 96 S. Ct. 1092, 47 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1976). Subjective grading by examiner is allowed.  Tyler v. Vickery, supra. "
34,4," I recognize that the majority believes an additional element of the immunity test is whether the state policy is ""actively 
supervised by the state itself."" Maj. op., ante, at 696.  Professor Areeda, however, observes that the Supreme Court has not yet 
required that governmental acts be supervised by the state. Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 
Harv.L.Rev. 435, 445 & 445 n.50. The cases cited by the majority do not apply the supervision test to public defendants -- and, of course, the Committee and its 
members are such defendants.  City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 410, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 1135, 55 L. 
Ed. 2d 364 (1978), quotes the ""active supervision"" language of Bates, without applying any such test.  New Motor Vehicle Board 
of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109, 99 S. Ct. 403, 411, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978), makes no mention of an ""active 
supervision"" test.  California Retail Liquor Dealers Assoc. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 943, 63 L. 
Ed. 2d 233 (1980), applies the test to a private defendant. Finally, Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 
40 n.14, 102 S. Ct. 841 n.14 (1982), expressly refused to reach the issue of whether active state supervision was required. Were the Midcal test of ""active supervision"" to be extended to include public defendants, I have no doubt that the test would be 
satisfied in the instant case by the Arizona Supreme Court's review.  Ariz.Sup.Ct. Rule 28(a) (1970); Ariz.Sup.Ct. Rule 
28(c)VII(B) (1974). "
35,," The majority declares that a triable issue remains as to whether the submission made by the Committee to the supreme court 
pursuant to Rule 28(c) was adequate to enable the supreme court to engage in the kind of active supervision which the majority 
concludes is required before the state action exemption will be available. Supreme Court Rule 28(c), as in effect at the relevant time, required the Committee to file its grading formula with the supreme 
court 30 days before the bar examination. As the majority notes, it apparently did not come to the attention of the district court, 
nor to this court until quite recently, that this rule was in effect at the time the conduct complained of by Ronwin occurred.  
However, this supreme court rule has the force of law, and the court can -- indeed must -- consider it in deciding whether the 
Committee's conduct was actively supervised by the court. In addition to considering the effect of Rule 28(c), however, the majority has also given weight to evidence not presented to the 
district court, and indeed not presented to this court until long after oral argument, purporting to bear on the actual nature of the 
submission made pursuant to Rule 28(c).  The record made by the parties in the district court contains no evidence whatsoever 
that would suggest any failure by the Committee to adequately inform the supreme court of its grading policies and procedures.  
I find it irregular for the court of appeals to go outside the record to decide an appeal from a dismissal by the district court.  As a 
matter of due process, the parties have a right to have their appeal heard on the basis of the factual record assembled in the 
court below."
35,5," In further contrast, the defendant in the instant case is a public defendant carrying out a state policy, whereas the defendants in 
Goldfarb were the private county bar and the state bar joining in essentially private activity.  See dissent at 705, supra. "
36,6," Arizona Supreme Court Rule 28(a) (1970), which assigns to the Committee the duty of screening applicants, provides in 
pertinent part: The committee shall examine applicants and recommend to this Court for admission to practice applicants who are found 
by the committee to have the necessary qualifications and to fulfill the requirements prescribed by the rules of the board of 
governors as approved by this Court respecting examinations and admissions . . . .  The Court will then consider the 
recommendations and either grant or deny admission. "
40,*," Senior Circuit Judge of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation."
40,1," .  There is no merit to appellant's apparent argument that an August 1980 court order that it file an amended complaint denied 
with prejudice a pending motion to dismiss.  The motion to dismiss was explicitly and properly renewed on October 9, 1980.  We 
are at a loss to understand how plaintiff thinks that it should be both free to file repeated, incoherent pleadings and immune to a 
motion to dismiss. "
44,1," .  Three other related actions have been filed here in this matter: McCluney v. Bluefield Community Hospital, Inc., et al, C.A.No. 
81-1102, an action removed by defendants to this Court on September 2, 1981; Bluefield Community Hospital, Inc. v. 
Anziulewicz, C.A.No. 81-1111; and, Bluefield Community Hospital, Inc. v. McCluney, C.A.No. 81-1116. "

Advertising Comm'n., 432 U.S. 333, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977); Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 340 U.S. 349, 71 
S. Ct. 295, 95 L. Ed. 329 (1951). There is no assertion that the statute favors local film distributors as against interstate 
distributors. Hunt, supra, 432 U.S. at 351-352, 97 S. Ct. at 2445-2446."
51,5, See Hrg. Tr. at 70-71.
51,6," This Court rejects the argument by counsel that the statute in question seeks to restrain trade in a manner requiring state 
supervision on a continuing basis.  See California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 
937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). The statute in question is self-
executing, leaving nothing further to be decided by the parties or supervised by the state.  It is a legislative decision ""that would 
itself satisfy the supervision requirement."" 1 Areeda & Turner, supra, P 213d at 76. No unsupervised private power remains.  Cf.  
Midcal Aluminum, supra, 445 U.S. at 102-106, 100 S. Ct. at 941-944. "
52,7," 17 U.S.C. § 201(e) provides as follows: (e) Involuntary Transfer.-When an individual author's ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a 
copyright, has not previously been transferred voluntarily by that individual author, no action by any governmental body or other 
official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate, transfer or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the copyright, or 
any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be given effect under this title except as provided under Title 11 (Bankruptcy). Warner Brothers alleges no such involuntary transfer under this section."
52,8," A parallel argument would be that videocassettes of Warner Brothers motion pictures marketed by Warner Brothers would be 
exempt from the sale of goods provisions of the Utah Uniform Commercial Code, see Utah Code Ann. §§ 70A-2-101 et seq., or 
that Warner Brothers' contracts are exempted by the Copyright Act from the operation of the statute of frauds, Utah Code Ann. § 
25-5-1 et seq. (1976).  Plaintiff offers no authority for such a view."
52,9," See Allied Artists Pictures Corp. v. Rhodes, 496 F. Supp. 408, 432-35 (S.D.Ohio 1980). Judge Troutman was looking at a 
different statute through a different lens in Associated Film Distribution Corp. v. Thornburgh, 520 F. Supp. 971, (E.D.Pa.1981.), 
rendering the result therein distinguishable from the case at bar. "
53,10," A state may reasonably regulate-even restrict-the use of private property without giving rise to a ""taking"".  See Penn Central 
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1978)."
53,11," Substantive due process analysis in the economic field of the type exemplified by Lochner has been lain dormant since 
Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 54 S. Ct. 505, 78 L. Ed. 940 (1934) and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 
S. Ct. 578, 81 L. Ed. 703 (1937). Since then, judicial scrutiny of economic legislation has been minimal at best.  E.g., Ferguson 
v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S. Ct. 1028, 10 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1963). At times the courts have posed even hypothetical grounds 
justifying enactment of challenged legislation.  See Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563 
(1955). While judicial scrutiny has remained strict in some non -economic areas, e.g., United States v. Carolene Products Co., 
304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 783-784 n. 4, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (1938), economic regulation has been sustained ""if any 
state of facts either known or reasonably inferrable afforded support for the legislative judgment."" L. Tribe, American 
Constitutional Law § 8-7 at 450 (1978). Recalling that Nebbia v. New York required that the legislative ""means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the 
end sought to be attained,"" id., 291 U.S. at 525, Professor Gerald Gunther has urged a more stringent judicial scrutiny of the 
rational basis of legislation ""by testing the reasonableness of the means in terms of the purposes put forth by the defenders of 
the law, rather than the Court's attribution of purposes a legislature might have had(.)"" G. Gunther, Cases and Materials on 
Constitutional Law 540 (10th ed. 1980) (emphasis in original).  This Court has applied that analytical approach to this case.  See 
Hrg. Tr. at 28-54."

881 (S.D.N.Y.1949)."
53,13," Such redistribution of power, for example, forms the basis of much labor legislation, see Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 27,

] "
54,14," Warner Brothers implicitly assails the Utah Legislature's decision to regulate motion picture distribution contracts in the 
manner specified as a denial of equal protection of the laws.  See Hrg. Tr. at 72.  As the United States Supreme Court observed 
in Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, 226 U.S. 157, 33 S. Ct. 66, 57 L. Ed. 164 (1912), If the legislature shares the now prevailing belief as to what is public policy and finds that a particular instrument of trade war is 
being used against that policy in certain cases, it may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without 
covering the whole field of possible abuses, and it may do so none the less that the forbidden act does not differ in kind from 
those that are allowed."

93 L. Ed. 533 (1949). The challenged statute does not even seek to regulate all means of distribution of motion pictures. See 
e.g., Salt Lake Tribune, December 18, 1981, at C9 (Warner Brothers' advertisement for rental of ""Superman II"" and other motion 
pictures on videocassettes). "

65,4," The broad latitude which is afforded the government in its lawful investigations of commercial enterprises and the traditional 
treatment of subpoena enforcement proceedings in a summary manner compelled this Court to deny the petitioners' discovery 
requests, designed to learn the scope and aims of the investigation in detail.  See Order of April 10, 1981.  Where similar 
discovery was allowed in three pending cases in the Southern District of New York, the government's responses do not appear "
66,," to be particularly illuminating.  Responses to many inquiries consisted of statements that the answers were no known because 
the Department had not yet received the documents requested in the CIDs.  Other responses were formulated in the same non-
specific terms that were used in the CIDs.  Farrell Lines, Inc. v. United States, 80 Civ. 4307 (S.D.N.Y. March 13, 1981) Answers

submitted to the Court accompanying a letter from Roger Fones, Esq. of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice dated

the inability to provide a great deal of information at this stage of the investigation is not surprising. "
67,5," The FMC is attempting to determine whether petitioners' activities are within the parameters of their approved agreements, 
whether the authorities conferred by approval have been fully utilized as contemplated by the Commission, whether the 
authorities conferred have been exercised in a manner not anticipated by the Commission at the time of approval, whether 
lesser anticompetitive restraints will serve to satisfy petitioners' legitimate commercial objectives; whether contained approval of 
the agreements in their present form is consistent with current FMC decisions and policy, and whether the activity of petitioners 
pursuant to the approved agreements is compatible with the criteria of approvability laid down in section 15 of the Shipping Act.

81,1," Although of no precedential value, it is interesting to note that the Daar litigation was eventually terminated by a settlement that 
utilized a fluid class recovery method for distributing damages.  Taxicab fares were reduced for future passengers over a certain 
period of time.  (See Comment, Manageability of Notice and Damage Calculation in Consumer Class Actions (1971) 70 
Mich.L.Rev. 338, 366, fn. 186.)"
81,2," The article cited states the ""overwhelming"" case for fluid class recovery as a matter of policy, but also argues that it is 
impermissible in antitrust class actions."
81,3," The United States Supreme Court has yet to decide the validity of fluid class recovery.  ( Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert (1980) 444 
U.S. 472, 480, fn. 6 [62 L.Ed.2d 676, 683, 100 S.Ct. 745]; Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin (1974) 417 U.S. 156, 172, fn. 10 [40 
L.Ed.2d 732, 745, 94 S.Ct. 2140].) "
82,4," HN4[
] Due process does not prevent calculation of damages on a classwide basis.  The Supreme Court has assumed the 
use of such a method ( Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, 67 Cal.2d, at pp. 706, 714, 716). In many cases such an aggregate 
calculation will be far more accurate than summing all individual claims.  (See Landers, supra, 47 So. Cal.L.Rev., at pp.  867-
868.)"
82,5," After evaluating the circumstances of the case before it, the Simer court held that fluid class recovery was not appropriate, 
because ""the relevant policies weigh against"" it.  The proposed class action was brought to recover money from the federal 
Community Services Administration under a program which it was administrating to provide cash assistance for fuel and utility 
bills to low income individuals and families, including the elderly.  The court examined the statute that created the program and 
concluded that the policies of deterrence and disgorgement were inapplicable and that, although ""the compensatory policy is 
seriously implicated . . . , [it] does not definitively lead one to conclude that fluid recovery is needed."" (661 F.2d, at p. 677.) We, 
of course, express no opinion on the accuracy of the conclusion reached in Simer, since it is only the analytic approach with 
which we are concerned. "
83,6," Indeed, the very labeling of the distribution schemes considered here as types of a ""fluid class recovery"" is unfortunately 
imprecise.  A more accurate name would be ""fluid class distribution,"" since what we are concerned with is the method of paying 
out damages after they have been recovered."
83,7," That the Legislature recognizes the distinction between the recovery and the distribution of damages is clear from an 
examination of a 1977 amendment to the Cartwright Act, which amendment will be more fully discussed infra.  Section 16760 of 
the Business and Professions Code was added to authorize the Attorney General or a district attorney to bring an action as 
parens patriae, on behalf of people injured by an antitrust violation.  Unlike for private antitrust actions, the methods for 
apportioning the money obtained in a successful parens patriae lawsuit is specified by statute.  Preceding the list of those 
methods, section 16760, subdivision (e) states, ""Monetary relief recovered by the Attorney General under this section shall be 
distributed as follows . .  . ."" (Italics added.) "
84,8," Section 16760, subdivision (e) reads in full: ""HN9[
] Monetary relief recovered by the Attorney General under this section shall 
be distributed as follows: ""(1) In such manner as the superior court having jurisdiction over the action in its discretion may authorize to insure, to the extent 
possible, that each person be afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure his appropriate portion of the monetary relief. ""(2) The Attorney General shall retain that portion of the monetary relief awarded by the court as costs of suit and attorney's fee 
for deposit in the Attorney General Antitrust Account within the General Fund. ""(3) To the extent that the monetary relief awarded by the court is not exhausted by distribution under paragraphs (1) and (2), the 
remaining funds shall be treated under the provisions of Article 3 (commencing with Section 1530) and Article 4 (commencing 
with Section 1540) of Chapter 7 of Title 10 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure as if it were unclaimed property, as defined in 
Section 1300 of the Code of Civil Procedure."" "
85,9," HN10[
] Under the Clayton Act, if the defendant has been found to have agreed to unlawfully fix prices, the amount of 
damages may be proved and assessed in the aggregate ""without the necessity of separately proving the individual claim of, or 
amount of damage to, persons on whose behalf the suit was brought."" Such damage calculation methods, however, are 
restricted to parens patriae actions brought by a state attorney general.  (15 U.S.C. §§ 15d, 15c(a)(1).) Using very similar 
language, the Cartwright Act also permits aggregate damage calculation in price fixing cases, but expressly allows that 
calculation to be made ""[in] any action under this chapter [the entire Cartwright Act]."" (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16760, subd. (d), 
italics added.) Thus, in private class actions such as the present case, aggregate damage calculation is expressly permitted 
under the Cartwright Act, whereas it is not authorized under the Clayton Act. There is also a material difference between the amendments of the two acts concerning the distribution of damages in parens 
patriae actions.  As has already been discussed, HN11[
] the Cartwright Act requires that any money left over after each 
person has had a reasonable opportunity to secure his appropriate portion of the monetary relief must be treated as unclaimed 
property.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16760, subd. (e).) Under the Clayton Act, however, subject to the requirement that each person 
have a reasonable opportunity to secure his appropriate portion, the monetary relief shall ""(1) be distributed in such manner as 
the district court in its discretion may authorize; or [para. ] (2) be deemed a civil penalty by the court and deposited with the State 
as general revenues . . . ."" (15 U.S.C. § 15e.) It therefore appears that a federal trial judge has more latitude in distributing 
damages in parens patriae suits than does a California trial judge."
85,10," The supermarkets request that we find fluid class recovery improper in this particular case, because, they claim, the 
""correlation"" or ""overlap"" between those injured and those to be benefited will be minimal.  This argument is best addressed to "
86,," the trial court when it considers whether this lawsuit may be maintained as a class action. Daar, Vasquez and Blue Chip Stamps 
all treat damages distribution as but one of several factors that must be weighed and balanced to determine the correctness of 
maintaining a class action. As the supermarkets themselves argue (albeit as a reason against our issuing an extraordinary writ), 
""To review one facet of the class certification questions, in isolation from all other factors that will ultimately have a bearing on 
the outcome, would result in an unsatisfactory, piecemeal review."" For this reason, we cannot now decide whether fluid class 
recovery is appropriate in this case.  We hold only that it is not per se inappropriate in cases of this type. "

92,1," Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code provides as follows: Art. 2315.  Every act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it. Because defendants have filed motions dealing with the disposition of the counterclaim to which plaintiff has not yet responded, 
a separate forthcoming opinion will be required to dispose of this aspect of the case. "
93,2," Plaintiff contends in its memorandum of fact and law that defendants engaged in eight Sherman Act offenses: A.  Defendants have engaged in horizontal price fixing at the manufacturing level in violation of Section One of the 
Sherman Act. B.  Defendants have engaged in vertical price fixing from the manufacturing level to the regional wholesale level in violation 
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. C.  Defendants have engaged in vertical price fixing from the manufacturing level to the local distribution level in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act. D.  Defendants have engaged in horizontal price fixing and market allocation at the local distribution level in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act. E.  Defendants have engaged in massive data dissemination in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. F.  Defendants agreed to territorial market allocation by contract, to the exchange of current customer and price 
information, and to the payment of five percent on all out-of-territory sales, all in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. G.  Defendants have engaged in a group boycott and concerted refusal to deal with plaintiff in violation of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. H.  Defendants have engaged in a conspiracy and attempt to monopolize in violation of Section 1 [sic] of the Sherman Act. Mr. Callahan is alleged to have participated in the above offenses.  He was not, however, named as a defendant in this lawsuit. 
Plaintiff also alleges the participation of Microventil, Crawford's European warehouse, and Glasgow Valve and Fitting, a 
European distributor of Crawford products, in the last claim, ""H"", listed above.  Microventil and Glasgow are not defendants in 
this lawsuit. "
97,3," Plaintiff introduced no evidence at trial in support of its claim that defendants engaged in massive data dissemination in 
violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. See footnote 2 supra, for plaintiff's claim ""E"".  While it is undisputed that Crawford 
distributors received invoices and checks pursuant to Crawford's five (5%) percent service commission program, there is no 
evidence in the record that these exchanges were sufficiently frequent to permit the issue of massive data dissemination to be 
submitted to the jury.  Rather, the only evidence on this issue, provided by defendants, was that the forwarded invoices 
represented a very small proportion of Crawford sales.  On this record, plaintiff's claim is insufficient for jury consideration.  See 
United States v. Container Corp. of America, 393 U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969)."
97,4," Plaintiff's memorandum of fact and law alleges four claims of price fixing, listed as offenses A-D.  See footnote 2 supra. "
98,5," There is considerable evidence in the record of ""bad blood"" between Richard Kenney, of Gibbons, and the officers of Capital.  
This poor relationship resulted from personal conflicts between Richard Keeney and Robert D. Jennings and John Uhl of Capital 
as well as business activities of Mr. Keeney and a Capital salesman, Frank Blackburn, which circumvented a Capital sales policy 
to their personal advantage."
98,6," Richard Kenney taped his conversations with Read, without the latter's knowledge.  The taped calls to Hays Glover, a sales 
trainee, and Fred Brunk, the sales manager at Read, do not prove a refusal to deal by Read.  They merely show a willingness to 
sell to plaintiff on certain terms and conditions, and plaintiff's unwillingness to buy on those terms and conditions.  Moreover, the 
identical order Mr. Keeney ostensibly sought to fill with Read had already been filled by Potomac."
98,7," In addition to the reasons set forth in footnotes 5-6 supra, for Capital and Read's decisions not to sell to Gibbons, the record 
shows that Capital and Read refused to sell to Gibbons out of a desire to adhere to their distributorship contracts.  There is no "
99,," evidence in the record to show a concerted refusal to deal.  Plaintiff argued that a letter, Plaintiff's Exhibit 21, written by Read to 
Crawford, supports its claim of a boycott: Dear Bill: We received the attached order [of Gibbons] from a company in New Orleans, La.  We feel that this is probably a supply 
house that Bob Jennings has refused to sell.  For this reason, we have refused this order and referred it to you for handling. Very cordially yours, Thomas A. Read cc: Bob Jennins [sic] Capital Valve and Fitting Co. enc. This letter is insufficient, in light of the record in the case, to support plaintiff's claim of boycott. Read followed a policy against 
selling to ""supply houses"" for resale.  This policy is based upon the need to identify the ""end user"" of Crawford products to 
guarantee proper service to the end user and proper application of the product.  It was also motivated by the five percent service 
commission program already referred to and designed to protect the reliability of the product by proper service. Even if this letter could be construed as a communication between distributors manifesting their hostility towards a resale 
customer like Gibbons, this construction would not give rise to an antitrust violation.  See National Auto Brokers v. General 
Motors Corp., 572 F.2d 953, 957 n. 7 (2d Cir.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1072, 99 S. Ct. 844, 59 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1979). Gibbons 
was not injured by this communication of June 22, 1978.  The uncontradicted evidence shows that the identical order referred to 
in Read's letter to Crawford had actually been filled by another distributor, Potomac, before Gibbons' initial request to Read had 
been made.  See footnote 6 supra.  No injury has been shown by the evidence submitted by plaintiff. Plaintiff has also failed to offer any substantial evidence that Crawford took any action to persuade its distributors to refrain from 
dealing with Gibbons.  See National Auto Brokers v. General Motors Corp., supra at 957 n. 6. The most that can be inferred from 
plaintiff's evidence is that Crawford distributors communicated with Crawford to seek information on their distributorship 
contracts, and that Crawford answered their requests.  The evidence can only be construed to show that Crawford did not force 
a distributor either to sell to or refrain from selling to a customer. It is undisputed that, after Read rejected Gibbons' contract 
terms, Crawford actively sought, and found, alternative distributors to fill Gibbons' orders. "
101,8," Richard Keeney testified that after Capital declined to sell him Crawford products, he had a relative purchase Crawford 
products from Potomac for him using his name to order.  Mr. Keeney gave this purchaser a small percentage commission for his 
efforts. Mr. Keeney testified that he felt compelled to act through this ""subterfuge"" out of a fear that, if Gibbons became known as the 
purchaser, Crawford distributors would refuse to sell to him.  Since, as this court has found above in its discussion of plaintiff's 
section 1 claims, Gibbons had not been a victim of any boycott by Crawford distributors, Mr. Keeney's claims of compulsion to 
act through a subterfuge are irrelevant to a consideration of any injury he may have suffered.  Mr. Keeney's actions were not 
legally caused by defendants and therefore cannot be viewed as an ""injury"" for Sherman Act section 1 purposes."
101,9," The salesman in charge of Gibbons' account at Capital was Frank Blackburn.  This account was a large one for Mr. Blackburn, 
and generated a large commission for him.  Mr. Blackburn therefore sought to retain the account by accommodating Mr. 
Keeney's requests for special packaging and expeditious delivery, even when doing so proved a fairly onerous task.  Such 
special and expeditious treatment was not usually provided by Capital to its customers. Rather, it was rare that any customer 
would be provided this service and Gibbons was perhaps alone in the frequency with which its demands were accommodated by 
Capital. "
102,10," See footnote 2 supra, for plaintiff's first two claims of defendants' misconduct, listed as offenses A and B. "
104,11," The Supreme Court, in dealing with cellophane, a patented article, emphasized that ""illegal power must be appraised in terms 
of the competitive market for the product,"" concluding that the product market was flexible packaging material, and not 
cellophane.  United States v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., supra at 393, 394-404, 76 S. Ct. at 1006, 1007-12. "
105,12, Plaintiff's predatory pricing allegations are contained in Paragraph 20 of the complaint:
105,20," .  In October and November of 1978, in order to defeat the export business that plaintiff had been able to reinstate 
because of its supply from Potomac Valve & Fittings, Inc., Defendant Crawford caused its European distributors to institute 
sudden, drastic, and discriminatory price reductions on Crawford Product with Crawford's support.  These price reductions 
destroyed the profitability of plaintiff's reinstated export business. In paragraph 30(e) and 31(e) plaintiff calls this ""predatory pricing."""
105,13," At oral argument on defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the predatory pricing claim, plaintiff claimed that defendants' 
predatory pricing, concerted refusal to deal and distributorship restrictions supported its Sherman Act section 2 claims of attempt 
to monopolize and conspiracy to monopolize. "
106,14," The officers of Crawford initially disagreed as to the mechanics of implementing the currency adjustments.  As a result, the 
frequency and immediacy of adjustments varied."
106,15," Dr. Thomas R. Saving, an expert witness for defendants and professor of economics, explained at trial that the currency 
exchange rates were so unstable during this period that Crawford's adjustments were too sporadic and delayed to compensate 
perfectly with the actual market changes. The following chart, prepared by Dr. Saving and introduced into evidence at trial, shows what a product that cost a dollar in 
Swiss francs in January 1977, would have cost at the beginning of each month for the three years 1977, 1978 and 1979, if the 
Crawford conversion factors were used."

109,**," Conversion factor increase Column 1 for each year shows what the dollar cost would have been if no adjustments had been made by Crawford in its 
conversion factor.  Column 2 for each year shows the adjusted prices that reflect the changes in Crawford's conversion factor.  
The points where the changes occurred are indicated by asterisk.  As explained by Dr. Saving: The average cost of a dollar in 1977 was $1.01 and in 1978 was $1.04.  In other words, for all of the 1978 Crawford's 
European prices were some 4% higher than in 1977 because they were not able to keep up with exchange rate 
movements.  Only in the latter part of 1978 does Crawford ever succeed in getting the price back to near a dollar and then 
they overshot the mark slightly.  By November, they were approximately even again.  During the latter part of 1978, the 
dollar improved against the franc and Crawford's response was to adjust its conversion factor upward.  By January 1979, 
the conversion factor was approximately back to a dollar."
109,16," Plaintiff argued that the depositions of David Cheetham, a Crawford distributor in the United Kingdom, offered evidence of a 
price reduction.  Mr. Cheetham referred at one point in his depositions to a 1978 ""drop"" in Crawford's European prices and later 
in his deposition stated that he was uncertain whether his prices to his customers had dropped or risen in 1978.  This court finds 
that counsel cannot rely on this reference in support of its case.  Mr. Cheetham clearly explained that if the prices were 
""dropped"" it was due to variations in the exchange rate.  This statement, when taken in context, is not sufficient evidence of 
predatory pricing."
109,17," See Transamerica Computer Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 481 F. Supp. 965, 990 (N.D.Cal.1979) 
(""Appropriately low prices are to be encouraged, not discouraged.  The punitive impact of the antitrust laws must not be 
permitted to compel high prices."") "

Broadway Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Serv., 651 F.2d 122 (2d Cir.1981). "
111,1," The court instructed the jury: ""Now public policy favors the settlement and quieting of litigation.  No adverse inferences should be drawn against Gibbons 
or the Keeneys if you believe they acted in good faith in making various proposals for the termination and settlement of any 
litigation with the defendants Crawford, Capital and Read. On the other hand, if you believe that these proposals were made in bad faith and for the purpose of using the litigation 
process as a means of coercing the defendants into awarding a distribution arrangement to Gibbons, a different conclusion 
would be justified."" Proceedings of November 17, 1981, Charge to Jury, at 97.  The court had occasion to repeat this instruction in an answer to one 
of the jury's questions during deliberations."
111,2," These lawyers do not appear to have been in continuous contact with the Keeneys after October 1978.  However, their firm, 
Sessions, Fishman, Rosenson, Boisfontaine & Nathan, clearly remained as New Orleans counsel to plaintiff after suit was 
initiated in March 1979; and there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury's conclusion that there had been full disclosure by the 
Messrs. Keeney to them as well as to San Francisco counsel, Alioto & Alioto. "
112,3," As the court instructed, the counterclaim contained three elements: 1) fault; 2) causation; and 3) damage.  See Ancora Corp. v. 
Stein, 445 F.2d 431 (5th Cir.1971). This counterclaim, arising under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2315, necessitated an inquiry 
as to whether plaintiff brought its lawsuit in good faith after full disclosure of the facts within the knowledge of Messrs. Richard 
and Cecil Keeney to their attorneys.  The interrogatories submitted to the jury are reproduced in the appendix."
112,4," Examples of such improper statements are excerpted from plaintiff's summation as follows: ""Before we analyze the evidence of what we respectfully submit to you is a sham counterclaim brought by a powerful 
company to crush a little company, which beat it in the market place over in Scotland and in Norway, just beat this cartel 
right in the market place, and all this counterclaim is when he speaks of motivations, the only motivation that exists in this 
case, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, is the motivation of a dominant company determined that it is going to monopolize 
the market in the North Sea, being upset by the fact that a young man who was an experienced salesman, not a rich, young 
man -- that kind of prejudice is really not worthy of eminent counsel, we don't make references to the fact that Mr. Callahan 
married the boss' niece, and we ought not to make those references."" [Proceedings of November 17, 1981, at 25.] ""Then you got the other attempt to prejudice you; this is the way monopolists always act.  I have practiced this 30 years in 
the courtroom, the other counsel tend to prejudice you by talking about some offensive act that took place."" [id. at 26-27.] ""All a boycott is, and don't be misled, all a boycott is or even a conspiracy, don't be misled by these terms, all it is is an 
agreement or a collaboration between businessmen not to sell or to impair or damage the sales efforts of somebody 
involved.  I am now on just that issue, of this supposed hostility."" "
113,," [Id. at 30.] ""If he wanted to throw that product in Lake Pontchartrain, that was his business from there on in.  Why did they stop him? -- 
for reasons that are very clear.  The bosses owned the distributorship over in Glasgow.  The bosses were in the wrong 
spot, because they went to Switzerland for tax reasons, English taxes he told you were a little rough.  But they were in the 
wrong spot.  And this huge company winds up in Glasgow when Aberdeen becomes a boom town."" [Id. at 32.] ""As I said yesterday, does Macy's tell Gimbel's? . . . ""So what happens? Keeney at this point is a price competitor to Mr. Lennon.  He doesn't know where the bosses are 
involved."" [Id. at 33-34.] "". . .. He would have been a little more careful about it if he knew the bosses owned the shipments over in Glasgow, and 
they were trying to, serving these two young Scots for awhile and then cutting them off, in early 1978. So into this breach comes this rich, spoiled young man, working 14 and 15 hours a day, everybody should be rich and 
spoiled like that. And he becomes an effective discounting competitor."" [Id. at 34-35.] ""We know he has them beat on price, because in 1977, he makes a comparison between a price list of Glasgow's and what 
he was buying the same product from Mr. Jennings in Louisiana; he says that comparison showed a price differential of 50 
to 70 percent; talk about monopoly pricing . . ."" [Id. at 35-36.] ""Does this sound like a boycott to you . . .?"" [Id. at 40.] ""One letter.  Here are three separate entities, Crawford in Cleveland, the man in Houston, the man in New Orleans; that 
combination evidencing the obvious agreement, saying that the refusal to sell was based upon this concert of action by 
three people, collaboration. . . . ""I wish to God that every victim of a monopolistic practice had that kind of evidence to start out with. . . .  It is just from this 
exterior evidence we have to fight our way through the secret councils of these monopolistic combines. . . ."" [Id. at 45-46.] ""Who says in the United States of America, under a Constitution, that somebody has to go, a couple of thousand miles 
away from his home town and get a moonlighting cousin, who is working in the swing shift in an apprentice shop, to go buy 
your goods for you.  Who says that is the way you are supposed to do business in the United States of America?"" [Id. at 52-53.] ""There is greed in this case, all those motivations, greed, cartel, keep the price above 50 to 70 percent of what he could buy 
it for in New Orleans in an oil exploration area.  You know why they got so excited about this thing, he was forcing them to 
lower their prices."" [Id. at 59.] ""You put the two together and what is the truth.  The truth is they did discuss cutting off Keeney.  The truth is Callahan did 
recommend cutting off Keeney, and his recommendation is like a great order."" "
114,," [Id. at 61.] ""You know the Constitution of the United States says every citizen has a right to petition the courts; and if that right is 
abridged by these huge companies being able to come in and collect a million and a half dollars, because these folks 
availed themselves of the right to go to court, which they have a right to do, a right to do, if that is ever abridged, nobody is 
going to have a right to get into these courts.  They are going to be frightened about getting into these courts. . . . ""Don't close the door, even to rich, spoiled young men, who don't marry the boss' niece.  Even to rich, spoiled young men 
don't close their door if they want to compete, pay their money.  The antitrust laws have been described as our charter of 
freedom, the arts of business, what the Constitution, the bill of rights is to everything else.  This is an attempt by the cartels, 
the monopolies, to throttle, to destroy the willingness of people to take their chances and compete on the merits."" [Id. at 62-63.]"
114,5," The following excerpt from the transcript of counsel's summation demonstrates that plaintiff's counsel refused to heed this 
court's ruling that he desist in his references to the antitrust claims, misstated the counterclaim issues as being one issue -- 
whether the Keeneys believed in their antitrust lawsuit -- and unfortunately injected his personal belief in plaintiff's suit.  See 
Draper v. Airco, Inc., 580 F.2d 91, 95-96 & n. 4 (3d Cir.1978) (quoting American Bar Association Disciplinary Rule 7-106(C)(4)). ""MR. ALIOTO: ""Now you only decide the issues today of whether or not there is substance to this lawsuit, nothing more.  We are sorry you 
aren't deciding the rest but in our judicial process that matter is going to be addressed now to an Appellate Court which we 
have been denied our right to a --"" ""JUDGE PALMIERI: ""I must interrupt you, that remark is entirely out of order and I ask the jury to disregard it.  It is entirely out of order for you to 
make any reference to my rulings and to the appellate process.  You have been permitted to address this jury on the 
counterclaim and nothing else."" ""MR. ALIOTO: ""Can I even tell them that matter is still in litigation. I just want to say this much, we say this lawsuit has substance, we believe in it, we have fought it out here, and we are 
going to fight it out in the appellate courts and the Supreme Court if we have to.  It is not the first time or the last time that 
we have to do that."" ""JUDGE PALMIERI: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever Mr. Alioto tells you about the suit is irrelevant to the issues before you.  The issue that 
you have to decide is an issue entirely separate from and distinct from his claims of cartel, monopoly, and all the other 
claims that he has made under the antitrust law. ""Now, of course, I don't need to say anything more except I do not want the issues before you to be confused and 
confounded with something that has been removed from your consideration."" ""MR. ALIOTO: ""I simply want to say to you that the Keeneys believe in this suit and that I believe in this suit, and we are going to see it 
through.  That is all I want to say to you.  That is germane to your issue as to whether or not this is a phoney suit brought 
for ulterior purposes.  I assure you they were different."" [Id. at 37-38.] "
115,6," This court instructed the jury: "". . . Don't be at all impressed by the fact that at times the attorneys have had little clashes and sometimes they have had 
little clashes with me, that is par for the course, as the expression goes. Our system of justice is based upon the adversary principle in which each side has the right to present its relevant evidence 
and make appropriate arguments. . . . But in the end you must be careful that your attention must be devoted exclusively to the evidence, the testimony of 
witnesses, the exhibits, any stipulations that counsel may have made and nothing else, because we, the lawyers and I, will 
have completed our functions once you retire for the jury room. . . . You will be exclusive judges of the facts.  It is you and you alone who determine where the truth lies, and you and you 
alone who attribute to that truth the probative value which you think it deserves. . . . At any rate, the important thing to remember is that to the extent that you use any recollection that is yours that controls to 
the exclusion of mine and to the exclusion of the lawyer's recollection, you should decide the case without fear, favor or 
prejudice as you are sworn to do only on the admissible evidence and subject to the law as I charge you. Remember, too, that although the lawyers perform a very important function in the case, they are the spokesmen for their 
clients; they act as the leading wedge for the partisan interest of their clients; nevertheless, they are not witnesses.  They 
cannot give you testimony.  What a lawyer says may be important in helping you to understand the evidence and helping 
you to focus on some aspect of the case may be important, but he is there as a partisan and as a guide, both, but never as 
a witness. . . . You have got to be very careful not to accept those statements of counsel as though they were part of the record.  They are 
not part of the admissible proof.  They were merely means of eliciting admissible proof.  If a question is combined with an 
answer, that can give you some testimony.  But a question standing alone, or a statement made by counsel itself does not 
constitute evidence in the case. Remember that the substance of the antitrust claims about which you heard so much testimony is not before you any 
longer.  You are not being asked to decide any issues pertaining to the antitrust claims in this case.  I will have more to say 
about what Mr. Alioto said concerning his desire to appeal and so forth; that is his right and his privilege.  But for the time 
being, remember that you are not here to adjudicate any rights on the part of some alleged victim of some alleged cartel 
and so forth. You have heard a lot about it in the summation of Mr. Alioto, but to the extent that you may be thinking of vindicating any 
antitrust rights, that is completely extraneous to your function in this posture of the case. I told you at the outset that we like to think of a trial as a conscientious search for the truth.  That is what we are really trying 
to do.  Your verdict, when you leave the courthouse today, should leave you with an abiding assurance that your verdict is "
116,," based on the truth as you found it, subject to the law as I charged it.  If that is the case, then justice will have been done.  If 
that is not the case, then something else has happened.  A case should never be a battle of wits, a contest in 
salesmanship, or a debate, a contest in eloquence, it is none of that. Some of those aspects of the case unfortunately do creep in, but when all is said and done, you must be careful to shield 
yourself against any temptation to do anything other than to find the truth on the basis of the admissible evidence and so 
see to it that that verdict represents your finding of the truth and the admissible evidence subject to the law as I charge you. . . . I regretted Mr. Alioto talked about how much he believes in his case and how hard he is going to fight up to the Supreme 
Court and the appellate process. . . . His beliefs are not an issue before you and the appellate process that may be pursued 
by his clients are extraneous to that function.  But since this matter has been mentioned, I feel constrained to advise you, 
as I advised the attorneys yesterday at a formal court session, that in the event you award any damages on this 
counterclaim, there will be no effective judgment based on those damages until the very last Appellate Court has said the 
very last word on the antitrust claims made by Gibbons. In other words, to use the legal terms, I will stay enforcement of any judgment entered on any verdict awarding damages 
until such time, if that time ever comes, when the last Appellate Court has confirmed the invalidity of Gibbons' antitrust 
claims. Now what this means is that there is an absolute predicate, a precondition to any effective recovery of damages by 
Crawford, Capital and Read on this counterclaim. And that is that Gibbons has brought a baseless lawsuit against them.  
We won't know for sure whether that suit was legally insufficient until the last Appellate Court has spoken, and that is why 
there will be no judgment enforced on any verdict you may render until some future day, whenever that day occurs, if it 
occurs. In short, there has to be a final determination of the antitrust suit in favor of Crawford, Capital and Read before they can 
recover on this counterclaim."" Proceedings of November 17, 1981, Charge to Jury, at 86-92, 114-16. "
120,1," BP originally filed a three-count cross-claim against Roberts: Count I asserted that BO's distributorship contracts with Roberts 
contained an indemnification provision applicable to this case; Count II asserted a common law right of indemnification to the 
extent that any liability may be imposed on it for acts of its ""agent"" Roberts under the doctrine of respondeat superior; and Count 
III asserted a right of contribution against Roberts.  In a stipulation by the defendants filed on June 19, 1981, BP waived Counts 
II and III of its cross-claim against Roberts leaving only Count I remaining.  Both parties waived their right to a jury trial on this 
remaining count. "
121,2, Roberts is the successor corporation and transferee of all assets and liabilities of Royal Petroleum Corporation. 
122,3," The holding in Professional Beauty Supply allowing contribution as a matter of federal common law in an antitrust case may be 
considered overruled in Texas Industries, Inc. which held that federal law does not allow an antitrust defendant to recover in 
contribution from co-conspirators.  The holding in Professional Beauty Supply that indemnification is not generally allowed under 
federal antitrust law, however, remains intact."

] Extrinsic circumstances can be considered in the interpretation of ambiguous contract terms under Massachusetts 
law.  Golden v. Pepper Shoe Corporation, 94 F.Supp. 100 (D.C. Mass. 1950). Boston and Maine Railroad v. Hall, 284 F.2d 474 
(1st Cir. 1960). In Golden, the court held that since the contract is fairly susceptible to more than one meaning, evidence of what 
occurred in the course of negotiations was relevant and not excluded by the parol evidence rule. Neither BP nor Roberts have requested a hearing to present parol evidence that might shed light on the intention of the parties 
when the term in question was included in the contract.  The Court, therefore, finds noteworthy an affidavit by Mr. Steven 
Roberts stating that there was never any discussion about the indemnification clause and that it was certainly not his 
understanding that he agreed to pay BP's attorney's fee if BP should be sued for some conduct that relates to their business 
relationship. "

137,1," .  Section 69-101, the general prohibitory provision of the antitrust laws, provides: Trusts and combinations lessening competition or controlling prices unlawful and void.-All arrangements, contracts, agreements, 
trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations made with a view to lessen, or which tend to lessen full and free 
competition in the importation or sale of articles imported into this state, or in the manufacture or sale of articles of domestic 
growth or of domestic raw material, and all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or 
corporations designed, or which tend, to advance, reduce, or control the price or the cost to the producer or the consumer of any 
such product or article, are declared to be against public policy, unlawful, and void. (emphasis added). Section 69-102 provides: Price fixing agreements unlawful and void.-Any arrangements, contracts and agreements that may be made by any corporation 
or person, or by and between its agents and subagents, to sell and market its products and articles, manufactured in this state, 
or imported into this state, to any producer or consumer at prices reduced below the cost of production or importation into this 
state, including the cost of marketing, and a reasonable and just marginal profit, to cover wages or management, and necessary 
incidentals, as is observed in the usual course of general business, and the continuance of such practice under such contracts 
and arrangements for an unreasonable length of time, to the injury of full and free competition, or any other arrangements, 
contracts or agreements, by and between its agents and subagents, which tend to lessen full and free competition in the sale of 
all such articles manufactured and imported into the state, and which amount to a subterfuge for the purpose of obtaining the 
same advantage and purposes are declared to be against public policy, unlawful and void. (emphasis added). "
138,," Section 69-103 provides: Penalties for violation of § 69-101 or 69-102-Prosecution of actions.-(a) Any violation of the provisions of either of §§ 69-101 or 
69-102 is declared to be destructive of full and free competition and a conspiracy against trade, and any person who may 
engage in any such conspiracy or who shall, as principal, manager, director, or agent, or in any other capacity, knowingly carry 
out any of the stipulations, purposes, prices, rates, or orders made in furtherance of such conspiracy, shall upon conviction be 
punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($ 100) nor more than five thousand dollars ($ 5,000), and by 
imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than (1) year nor more than (10) years; or in the discretion of the court, by either such 
fine or imprisonment. (b) Any violation of the provisions of §§ 69-101 or 69-102 by a corporation shall upon conviction be punished by a fine not 
exceeding one million dollars ($ 1,000,000). (c) The attorney general and reporter of the state shall have the power to institute criminal proceedings against persons and 
corporations for violations of the provisions of §§ 69-101 or 69-102, that involve the award of a contract by the state.  However, 
the attorney general and reporter shall have jurisdiction to institute criminal proceedings that involve violations on contracts 
awarded by political subdivisions of the state upon the written request of the local district attorney general.  (emphasis added). Section 69-104 provides: Forfeiture of charter for destruction of competition or conspiracy against trade-Foreign corporation excluded from doing 
business-Duty of attorney-general-Any corporation chartered under the laws of the state which shall violate any of the provisions 
of either of §§ 69-101 or 69-102 shall thereby forfeit its charter and its franchise, and its corporate existence shall thereupon 
cease.  Every foreign corporation which shall so violate is denied the right to do, and is prohibited from doing, business in this 
state.  It is made the duty of the attorney-general to enforce these provisions.  (emphasis added). Section 69-105 provides: Debts, joint and several-Liability for.-All persons and corporations, and the officers and the stockholders of all corporations, that 
shall become or continue to be members of, or in any way connected with or concerned in, any such trust, contract, agreement, 
or combination, shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all the debts, obligations, and liabilities of each and every person and 
corporation that may become or continue a member thereof, connected therewith, or concerned therein, as fully as if all were 
partners in the creation of such debts, obligations, and liabilities.  (emphasis added). Section 69-108 provides: Trust or combination may be pleaded in abatement or bar of suits.-When action at law or suit in equity shall be commenced in 
any court, it shall be lawful, in the defense thereof, to plead in bar or in abatement of the action that the plaintiff, or any other 
person or corporation interested in the prosecution of the action, is a member or connected with, and the cause of action grows 
out of, some business or transaction with such trust, pool, contract, arrangement, or combination as described in either of §§ 69-
101 or 69-102.  (emphasis added). Despite the apparent precision of language utilized in the above-noted sections, this Court observes that at least one other 
section of the antitrust laws is in fact ambiguous in regard to the person/corporation issue. Section 69-107 states: Witnesses in actions for damages-Competency-Incrimination.-Upon the trial of any civil action against any person for a violation 
of any preceding section in this chapter, all officers, stockholders, and agents of such corporation, person, or copartnership shall 
be competent witnesses against the defendant, as such, on trial; and such officers, stockholders, and agents may be compelled 
to testify against such defendant, and produce all books and papers in their custody or control pertinent to the issues in such 
action at or before the time of trial, and shall not be excused from producing any books or papers because the same might tend 
to criminate such witnesses; but nothing which such witness shall testify to, and no books or papers produced by him, shall in 
any manner be used against him in any criminal action to which he is a party.  (emphasis added). It can certainly be argued that the seeming inconclusiveness of the word ""person"" as first utilized in section 69-107 supports 
plaintiff's position.  On the whole, however, this Court believes that even in section 69-107 a delineation has been made 
between natural persons and corporations similar to that which exists in the other sections of the antitrust law, including section 
69-106. "
139,2," .  As enacted by Chapter 140, Tennessee Public Acts of 1903, the section stated: Sec. 4.  Be it further enacted, that any person or persons or corporation that may be injured or damaged by any such 
arrangement, contract, agreement, trust or combination, described in section 1 of this act, may sue for and recover in any court 
of competent jurisdiction in this state of any person or persons or corporation operating such trusts or combination, the full 
consideration or sum paid by him or them of any goods, wares, merchandise or articles, the sale of which is controlled by such 
combination or trust.  (emphasis added). See State ex rel. Cates v. Standard Oil Co., 120 Tenn. 86, 100, 110 S.W. 565, 568 (1908); Standard Oil Co. v. State, 117 Tenn. 
618, 628, 100 S.W. 705, 707 (1907)."
139,3," .  Plaintiff basically argues that a poor choice of words resulted in the deletion of the ""or persons or corporation"" portion of the 
section's language.  The antitrust law was amended in 1927 to proscribe price-fixing. Tenn.Pub.Act of 1927, ch. 60, codified at 
T.C.A. § 69-102 (1976).  Section 3 of the 1927 Act stated that ""any person damaged (by price-fixing) shall have the civil action 
for damages given under Section 4 of (the 1903) Anti-Trust Act."" As is evident, the 1927 Act uses only the word ""person,"" 
without reference to ""corporation."" When the laws were recodified in 1932, the words ""or persons or corporations"" were deleted 
from Section 4 of the Antitrust Act, the precursor to section 69-106, and the section was left with specific reference only to a 
""person."" Plaintiff contends that the 1927 amendment was intended to incorporate section 4 of the 1903 Act in its entirety and 
that the 1932 recodification misinterpreted the use of the word person in the 1927 Act when limiting the language of section 4(s 
69-106).  This Court is not unsympathetic to plaintiff's argument.  Nevertheless, in light of the other considerations noted by this 
Court, this Court does not find the contention compelling."
139,4," .  The Tennessee Supreme Court focused on section 3 of the 1903 Act, which declared that any violation of the provisions of this act shall be deemed, is hereby declared to be, destructive of full and free competition, and 
a conspiracy against trade, and any person or persons who may engage in any such conspiracy, or who shall, as principal, 
manager, director, or agent, or in any other capacity, knowingly carry out any of the stipulations, purposes, prices, rates or 
orders made in furtherance of such conspiracy, shall upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars 
or more than five thousand dollars, and by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than one year nor more than ten years; or in 
the judgment of the court, by either such fine or imprisonment. (emphasis added)."
139,117," Tenn. at 628, 100 S.W. at 707."
139,5," .  The court also noted, however, that the term ""person"" is not always restricted to natural persons.  The full meaning of the term 
depends upon the specific context in which it is used.  As the court in Standard Oil Co. stated, The word ""person"" is a general or generic term; hence, when embraced in a statute, it embraces not only natural persons, but 
also artificial persons, such as private corporations, unless the context indicates that it was used in a more limited sense, or the 
subject matter of the act leads to a different conclusion; that is to say, it applies to corporations in all instances where it can 
reasonably or logically so apply….  But still there are many cases in which the Legislature does not mean that the word ""person"" 
shall include corporations.  This is always a question of intention, and the intention must be sought for and determined in each 
case by the aid of the context, the general scope and purposes of the act, and other pertinent considerations. "
140,117," Tenn. at 650, 100 S.W. at 713. This Court agrees with the Supreme Court of Tennessee that ""person"" ordinarily can mean 
both natural persons and corporations.  Indeed, as stated earlier in this Memorandum, this Court believes that in the general 
context of antitrust laws, a statutory provision relating to ""persons"" would be applicable to both natural persons and corporate 
entities. In the specific context of the Tennessee antitrust law, however, this Court must conclude that the legislature intended 
the word ""person"" to mean just that: a human being."
140,6," .  As the court stated: Considering this statute as a whole, we do not think it was the intention of the Legislature that the word ""persons,"" as used in it, 
should include corporations.  We think this conclusion is irresistible from the uses of both terms ""persons and corporations"" in 
some sections of the statute, and that of only one in other sections, when taken in conjunction with the subject-matter of the 
several sections."
140,117," Tenn. at 650, 100 S.W. at 713."
140,7," .  The only state court opinion addressing the issue in the instant case is in agreement with this Court both in its evaluation of 
the Standard Oil Co. decision and in its general conclusion.  In Davis-Watkins Co. v. Service Merchandise Co., Inc., No. 77-
1329-I (Chancery Ct. Dec. 21, 1978), the state Chancery Court, Hon. Ben H. Cantrell presiding, ruled that section 69-106 did not 
apply to corporations.  Chancellor Cantrell, in a brief Memorandum opinion, cited Standard Oil Co. and reasoned that because 
certain sections of the antitrust law applied specifically to persons and corporations, section 69-106, with its reference only to 
persons, was not meant to apply to both.  No other courts have dealt with the issue involved here.  Indeed, few courts have had 
occasion even to consider the Tennessee law.  See, e.g., In re Wiring Device Antitrust Litigation, 498 F. Supp. 79, 86-87 
(E.D.N.Y.1980)."
140,8," .  In 1981 the Tennessee state legislature added two subsections to section 69-103, which generally provides criminal penalties 
for violations of sections 69-101 and 69-102.  Subsection (b) enacted criminal fines for corporations, since section 69-103 had 
previously been applicable only to natural persons.  Subsection (c) granted certain prosecutorial powers to the state Attorney 
General.  See note 1 supra.  In amending the statute, the legislature clearly indicated its concern that criminal penalties apply to 
corporations and delineated that intent with explicit language. Section 69-106 similarly could be amended if it is the legislature's 
intent that it apply to more than just natural persons. "

Center, at Kam Shopping Center, at Salt Lake Shopping Center, and at University Square; and on Maui at Maui Mall."
153,2," .  Article II of the 1974 Lease contains the following sections pertaining to minimum and percentage rent: Section 3.01.  Minimum Rent. For each and every calendar month during the term of this lease commencing on the first day of 
July, 1974, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on or before the first day of each month, at Landlord's office, the minimum rent of TWO 
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND NO/100 ($ 2,313.00) per month. …. Section 3.02.  Percentage Rent. For each and every calendar month or fraction thereof during the term of this lease, Tenant 
shall pay to Landlord on or before the 10th day of the next succeeding month as additional rent a sum of money determined by 
deducting the minimum monthly or fractional monthly rent from the percentage rent for such preceding calendar month or 
fractional month.  The percentage rent shall be determined as follows: Seven percent (7%) of all gross sales. "
154,3," .  The April 2, 1979, letter from Dillingham to Bartleys states in full: Dear Messrs. Bartley: Thank you for meeting with Josie Bidgood, Alice Guild and me on various occasions to discuss the Bartley's (sic) Town and 
Country lease. As we explained to you in our meetings, a decision not to renew a lease is the result of lengthy and careful consideration on the 
part of the management of Ala Moana Center.  We always regret having to reach such a decision, and certainly this is true in 
Bartley's (sic) case. As Doug Miki discussed with you last spring, competition in the marketplace will always be a factor with which business people 
must deal.  We can appreciate your frustration in no longer being able to obtain exclusive representation of certain lines.  This is 
a trade regulation, however, by which all suppliers and retailers must abide and we believe can be effectively dealt with by 
identifying other means of attracting customers, such as, offering better customer service or identifying unique marketing and 
merchandising methods. Unfortunately, Bartley's (sic) has not kept pace with the growth of its merchandise category or the Center since 1976.  While Ala 
Moana Center had an increase in 1978 of nearly 14 percent, Bartley's (sic) sales decreased by 5.3 percent.  A copy of Bartley's 
(sic) 5-year sales history is attached. In response to your observation that due to Bartley's (sic) volume, significant percentage gains should not be expected, we cite 
the fact that Ala Moana's sales base at the end of 1977 was $ 285 million, yet the Center enjoyed an increase of approximately $ 
40 million in 1978.  This substantial growth was achieved through an aggressive marketing program and the diligent efforts of 
most of our merchants, in spite of increased competition from new developments in Waikiki, and the continued growth and 
improvement of other shopping complexes on Oahu. You mentioned in our conversation, and your letter of May 26, 1978 to Doug Miki, that Bartley's (sic) had a ""hard nut to crack"" 
following its performance in 1976.  We believe it is not unreasonable to expect a retailer's sales growth to at least keep pace with 
inflation, which Bartley's (sic) did not do in 1977 or 1978.  In fact, the sales decrease in 1978 is even more significant when the 
loss is measured against the rate of inflation. In both of Doug's letters to you last year, he expressed the staff's concern at the sales trend of Bartley's (sic) and both times 
encouraged you to seek our assistance, which you elected not to do.  We would like to reiterate that, while we are available and 
willing to spend time with merchants, we respect their right to decline our offer of assistance. We hope that you will give consideration to our comments and consider applying them constructively toward a substantial 
improvement in the performance of your Susie's store.  Again, if we can be of any assistance to you in regard to Susie's, please 
feel free to call upon any member of the management staff. Pursuant to our earlier discussions, we would like to confirm our agreement to extend your tenancy on a month-to-month basis 
until August 31, 1979 when the lease expires on June 30, 1979.  The provisions of Section 27.03 of the lease agreement shall 
govern this two-month holding over period. "

States, or foreign nations is declared to be illegal. "

170,1," .  The Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the state case was filed after oral argument.  That court held the lease agreement 
did not run afoul of the state antitrust law because it had been authorized in another, more specific, Arizona statute and the 
authorization was not unconstitutional.  Arizona Downs v. Arizona Horsemen's Foundation, 130 Ariz. 550, 637 P.2d 1053 (Ariz. 
1981). In arriving at its conclusion, the Arizona Supreme Court noted that its analysis of the state antitrust claim is inapplicable to 
federal antitrust claims.  See id., 130 Ariz. at 559-560, 637 P.2d at 1062-1063 & n.3. "
171,," Agreeing with the latter conclusion, we conclude that the principle of res judicata is not a bar to our proceeding.  Unlike the 
situation in Nash County Bd. of Educ. v. Biltmore Co., 640 F.2d 484 (4th Cir. 1981) (which held that a state antitrust judgment 
may bar a federal antitrust action), we are not confronted with a configuration of ""like statutes of two separate jurisdictions,"" 
which condemn ""the same wrong."" Id. at 490. Indeed, the Arizona Supreme Court's decision conclusively established that the 
lease agreement was outside the ambit of the state antitrust law.  It, therefore, is unnecessary for us to decide at this time 
whether this circuit should adopt the holding in Nash."
171,2," .  As the Supreme Court noted in McLain, to accept Downs' argument would mean that failure of an alleged restraint to succeed 
would bar an action.  444 U.S. at 243, 100 S. Ct. at 509-510. Because the Sherman Act bases liability on proof of either ""an 
unlawful purpose"" or ""an anticompetitive effect,"" such cannot be the jurisdictional test.  Id.  Rather, HN3[
] success of an illegal 
restraint would only affect the measure of damages. "
172,3," .  Strictly speaking, Younger abstention is appropriate where, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid state statute,

96 S. Ct. at 1245; Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971). It has subsequently been expanded to 
include some civil proceedings, e.g., state nuisance proceedings antecedent to a criminal prosecution for exhibiting obscene 
films, Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95 S. Ct. 1200, 43 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1975); collection of state taxes, Great Lakes

in an ongoing state court proceeding, Worldwide Church of God, Inc. v. California, 623 F.2d 613, 615 (9th Cir. 1980). In 
essence, concerns of federalism and comity compel a party to exhaust their state court remedies before seeking federal relief.

173,4," .  Indeed, it is entirely possible that the Commission could effectively force Turf to rent the track to another party should it deem 
it preferable to have another entity operate the track some of the time by simply denying Turf a permit to race on those days now 
reserved for Downs.  Alternatively, there is nothing theoretically stopping Downs from building its own track in Maricopa County 
and applying again to the Commission for racing permits.  Moreover, it is arguable that the application of Burford abstention is 
particularly inappropriate in the context of a federal antitrust claim. HN5[
]"
173,5," .  This exception is distinct from Pullman, Younger, or Burford abstention, and the circumstances in which it is appropriate are 
considerably more limited.  Tovar, 609 F.2d at 1293 (citing Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 818, 96 S. Ct. at 1246-1247)."
173,6," .  Cf.  Weiner v. Shearson, Hammill & Co., Inc., 521 F.2d 817, 821-22 & n. 22 (9th Cir. 1975) (noting that normally abstention 
would be inappropriate when the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction over federal securities claims, but that when such claims 
are also pleaded as affirmative defenses to an otherwise identical state action, abstention might be appropriate because the 
state court could decide the federal securities issues). "
175,7," .  The Parker v. Brown state action doctrine should be distinguished from the related but different doctrine of implied immunity 
flowing from the passage or existence of other federal statutes.  See, e.g., National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology 
Center v. Blue Cross of Kansas City, 452 U.S. 378, 101 S. Ct. 2415, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1981)."
175,8," .  Turf argues that Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 791, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 2015, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), requires that 
the conduct be ""compelled"" by the state acting as sovereign rather than merely ""prompted."" It appears that the statement in 
Goldfarb regarding compulsion refers to a combination of the criteria that there be both a clear articulation of state policy and 
active supervision by the state itself.  421 U.S. at 788-91, 95 S. Ct. at 2013-2015. In Goldfarb neither was present, and the 
opinion did not specifically separate the criteria.  Thus, Goldfarb does not preclude a finding of state action immunity merely 
because of the presence of some private decision making pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy that is actively supervised 
by a state entity even though the supervision does not rise to the level of compulsion. We recognize that other courts have found a ""compulsion"" requirement when reviewing conduct of ""private"" parties.  See, e.g., 
Northeastern Telephone Co. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 497 F. Supp. 230, 237-38 & n.9 (D.Conn.1980). We 
find further support for our view that compulsion is not required in Cantor.  Justice Stevens, when speaking for the Court in 
Section III of the opinion, see note 12, infra, noted that typically, regulated industries ""involve a blend of public and private 
decisionmaking."" 428 U.S. at 592, 96 S. Ct. at 3118 (footnote omitted).  He noted that ""state authorization, approval, 
encouragement, or participation in restrictive private conduct confers no antitrust immunity."" Id. at 592-93, 96 S. Ct. at 3118-
3119 (footnotes omitted).  He went on to note the parallel problem of determining when state action for due process and equal 
protection purposes exists in the regulatory context.  Id. at 594 n.31, 96 S. Ct. at 3119 n.31. He cited Jackson v. Metropolitan "
176,," Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 95 S. Ct. 449, 42 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1974), which noted the importance of whether the private party 
initiated the challenged practice, and the degree to which the state agency puts ""its own weight on the side of the proposed 
practice."" Id. at 357, 95 S. Ct. at 456-457. Such an inquiry would be useless if state compulsion were the litmus test for antitrust 
immunity. Here, it was clearly the state legislature that initiated the practice, and thus the question must turn on the degree to 
which the state or its agency has put ""its own weight on the side of (that) practice."""
176,9," .  Turf also argues in its brief that even if Parker v. Brown immunity were to apply in this case, that the ""Parker defense can be 
raised only by a governmental entity that is a party to the lawsuit."" Turf relies primarily on Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 
579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976), for this proposition.  Id.  Turf misreads Cantor, and its position is unsupportable. Justice Stevens authored the opinion in Cantor.  In Part II he found that since the actions complained of were actions of private 
parties, albeit arguably under state compulsion, that Parker was inapplicable because it had involved actions of the state.  428 
U.S. at 585-92, 96 S. Ct. at 3115-3118. Part II was accepted only by Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall, id. at 581, 96 S. Ct. 
at 3113, and consequently did not command a majority of the court.  Part III, which did command a majority, then proceeded to 
analyze the relationship between the conduct of the private party and the state regulatory agency to determine if immunity was 
available nonetheless.  Id. at 592-98, 96 S. Ct. at 3118-3121. It concluded that immunity was not available under the facts of 
Cantor.  Id. The view expressed in Part II of Cantor that private conduct that is intertwined with state conduct cannot support an immunity 
defense for the private actor was implicitly rejected in California Liquor Dealers v. Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 
63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). There, the Court specifically stated that it was considering ""whether the State's involvement in the price 
setting program is sufficient to establish antitrust immunity under Parker v. Brown."" Thus, Turf's contention regarding Cantor is 
unsupportable.  Moreover, Cantor cannot possibly be read to stand for the proposition that Turf asserts.  Justice Stevens' 
opinion itself recognized that immunity might apply to conduct of private parties, albeit not under Parker, in Part III.  428 U.S. at 
592-98, 96 S. Ct. at 3118-3121. Consequently, regardless whether immunity flows to private conduct under Parker, or under 
some other ""regulatory"" doctrine, it may still be available to a private party as a defense. "

183,*," Oral argument on defendants' motions for directed verdict was entertained throughout the day of December 8, 1981.  Prior to 
that hearing, the Court had requested defendants to file a brief in support of their motion not later than December 1 and plaintiffs 
an opposition not later than December 3, 1981.  When plaintiffs filed no opposition by the end of December 3, the Court made 
inquiries and was informed by plaintiffs' counsel that they did not intend to file a brief.  Nonetheless, on the morning of December 
8, only minutes before oral argument was to commence and in disregard of the Court's express deadline, plaintiffs' counsel 
provided two memoranda.  These papers properly should not be considered for that reason, but to protect plaintiffs' interest in

204,14," This is consistent with the overall scheme of the Act to encourage various state law enforcement activities intended to curb 
antitrust violations.  As Representative Preyer explained: In section 3(a) and section 14 of the bill, amending Section 6(f) and adding a new section 21 to the FTC Act, we intended to 
confirm the Commission's policy of providing documents and information on a nonpublic basis to Federal law enforcement 
agencies and to State attorneys general for State law enforcement purposes.  This sharing of information is in the best spirit of 
Federal-State cooperation.  It enhances the States' ability to remedy, in a manner chosen by the State, economic activities that 
have adversely affected their citizens.  It saves taxpayers' money by minimizing duplication of efforts and by reducing the time 
and effort necessary to conduct State investigations."
204,126," Cong.Rec. H3870 (daily ed. May 20, 1980) (emphasis added)."
204,15," In effect, Congress statutorily authorized the Commission's implementation of policy rather than mandating disclosure. The 
use of ""may"" accordingly means no more than that the Commission need not automatically accede to each and every valid 
request for access to the Commission's files.  As long as the Commission is not acting in an arbitrary or capricious manner, it 
may deem disclosure inappropriate or undesirable in certain cases as to whose nature we need not speculate.  It is, in fact, 
Commission policy not to share documents with state officials automatically, but rather to evaluate requests on a case-by-case 
basis.  See Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Nov. 10, 1980, J.A. 289, 292."
204,16," The record does not reveal the actual competitive sensitivity and confidential nature of the information sought to be released 
in this case.  Inasmuch as appellants erroneously assumed that confidential materials are entitled to special consideration prior 
to disclosure under §§ 6(f) and 21(b) (6), the District Court assumed for the purposes of summary judgment the confidentiality of 
the material.  See n.1 supra."
204,17," If these sections were not specifically promulgated to expedite the nonpublic disclosure of confidential information they would 
be superfluous.  There would be no need for even the standards established in these sections inasmuch as nonsensitive 
material would be in the public domain under the auspices of disclosure provisions such as the Freedom of Information Act."
204,18," We need not consider whether the Commission must evaluate the state attorney general's specific intended use of the 
material or instead may rely on the attorney general's certification that the materials will be used only for official law enforcement 
purposes.  In the instant case, the Commission was fully cognizant of the states' intended use of the materials and correctly 
determined such use to be authorized.  For example, the state of Maryland filed its civil treble damage suit in federal court on 
June 19, 1980, and the FTC did not decide to grant discretionary release of the materials to Maryland until July 11, 1980.  See 
J.A. 68.  Additionally, during the disclosure process prior to the bringing of this action, the General Counsel's Office specifically 
rejected appellants' argument that the states were not seeking the documents for official law enforcement purposes.  See

] Tying arrangements are abhorred by the courts primarily because they foreclose a substantial quantity of business 
to competitors and extend preexisting economic power to new markets for no good justification. . . .  Foreclosure implies

power, would then incorporate an illegal tie. American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc., 446 F.2d 1131, 1137 (2d Cir. 1971) (citation

that the judge was made aware of Muko's position ""before the jury retire(d) to consider its verdict."" See, e.g., Appendix 63a-66a; 
98a-102a; 1138a; 1220a-1221a.  We therefore conclude that Muko did not waive its right to appeal under Rule 51.  See United

determining that the agreement implementing the Rules on Containers violated § 8(e), the Board had applied an incorrect legal 
standard.  The Court therefore remanded that case to the Board for further proceedings, and subsequently vacated and 
remanded our decision in Conex for further consideration in light of International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 447 U.S. at 902, 100 S.

curiam), included that case among those applying a per se rule. "
259,1," Plaintiff argues that defendants' restraints limited the supply in interstate commerce of a substantial amount of electricity, citing 
McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232 (1980) for the proposition that jurisdiction is not defeated ""in a case 
relying on anticompetitive effects by plaintiff's failure to quantify the adverse impact of defendant's conduct."" Id. at 243. However, 
jurisdiction is not the issue here.  The Court is not holding that plaintiff would be unable to prove that a ""substantial"" volume of 
interstate commerce is involved.  The Court holds only that plaintiff cannot show that defendants' alleged conduct had any effect 
on competition in the geothermal steam market. Although plaintiff has not made the point, both the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court have indicated, in dicta, that one can 
show a Section 1 violation, absent proof of anticompetitive effect, by showing anticompetitive intent.  However, the Supreme 
Court has recently examined the ""rule of reason"" as spelled out in the landmark case of Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 
U.S. 1, 58 (1911), and has concluded that HN3[
] liability under that rule can be ""based either (1) on the nature or character of 
the contracts, or (2) on surrounding circumstances giving rise to the inference or presumption that they were intended to restrain 
trade and enhance prices.  Under either branch of the test, the inquiry is confined to a consideration of impact on competitive 
conditions."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 690 (1978). Since plaintiff cannot show 
that defendants' conduct had any impact on competitive conditions, plaintiff cannot establish liability under the rule of reason. "
260,2," Since the term ""group boycott"" can ""… be applied to divergent types of activity, not all of which necessarily have a pernicious 
effect on competition or lack any redeeming virtue,"" Ron Tonkin Gran Turismo, Inc. v. Fiat Distributors, Inc., 637 F. 2d 1376, 
1383 (9th Cir. 1981), the Court must be particularly wary of applying a per se rule to ""boycotts"" which differ significantly from 
those boycotts to which a per se rule has been applied. "
261,3," For consideration of the relevant geographic market, see pp. 13-14, infra."
261,4," Plaintiff responds that defendants' ""boycott"" cannot be governed by the rule of reason since ""[f]or a relationship to qualify for a 
rule of reason treatment… it is not enough that it be shown to be vertical; there must also be some 'redeeming virtue,' some 
possibility that the terms of the relationship hold out the prospect of being pro-competitive."" United States v. Koppers Co., Inc., 
652 F. 2d 290, 297 (2d Cir. 1981). In Koppers, however, the court found that the conspiracy in question, though vertical, was 
anticompetitive. Id. In this circuit, HN5[
] the use of a per se rule is justified only if the challenged conduct ""clearly had, or was 
likely to have, a pernicious effect on competition and lacked any redeeming virtue."" Ron Tonkin, supra, 637 F. 2d at 1387 
(emphasis added).  Keeping in mind the purpose of the per se rules, it makes sense to require that such a rule be applied only 
when it is obvious that the challenged conduct is likely both to have a pernicious effect on competition and to lack any redeeming 
virtue.  As pointed out above, per se rules came into existence only after the courts found that certain restraints almost inevitably 
violated the rule of reason. Under the rule of reason, one must weigh the harms and benefits of a given practice.  Even if an 
action has no competitive benefits, it does not violate the rule of reason if it has no effect on competition.  Gough, supra, 585 F. 
2d at 389. It would be anomalous to apply a per se rule to a category of restraints as to which no anticompetitive effects could be 
assumed or demonstrated, for no given restraint within that per se category would violate the rule of reason. In the case at bar, 
since plaintiff has not identified any effect on competition resulting from defendants' alleged conspiracy and since the Court 
cannot conclude that the alleged conspiracy was likely to have a pernicious effect on competition, a per se rule against group 
boycotts is not applicable. "
263,5," It would, in fact, appear that PG&E enters into these long-term contracts, and that the California Public Utilities Commission 
regulates the prices paid to steam producers, precisely in order to prevent the creation of ""little monopolies."" Due to the 
transportation limitations on geothermal steam, defendants are PG&E's only source of steam for Unit 15.  In an ""unregulated"" 
market, then, defendants would have had monopoly power after Unit 15 had been built -- PG&E could have been forced to pay 
monopoly prices for defendants' steam in order for it to protect its capital investment in the power plant.  Under the current 
contractual and regulatory framework, however, defendants lack such power. "

271,7," The ""free rider"" problem arises with products which require service and repair as a part of the whole sales package.  The 
availability of such services affects the competitiveness of a manufacturer's products.  Discounters are tempted by market forces 
to retail their products without providing such services, hoping to gain a ""free ride"" from authorized distributors who are forced to 
provide such services for the manufacturer's product without receiving the benefits from retailing the product.  The Supreme 
Court in Sylvania concluded that the ""free rider"" problem was one of the legitimate justifications for manufacturer restrictions on 
the number and locations of their distributors. 433 U.S. at 55, 97 S. Ct. at 2560."
271,8," 433 U.S. at 51, 97 S. Ct. at 2558. The Court went on to explain the distinctions between interbrand and intrabrand 
competition: Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product-television sets in this case-and 
is the primary concern of antitrust law.  The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where 
there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors-wholesale or retail-
of the product of a particular manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the manufacturer. 
Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a monopolist and no 
intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry.  But when 
interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of 
intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product. Id. n. 19. "
272,9," 433 U.S. at 54, 97 S. Ct. at 2559. The efficiencies perceived by the Supreme Court as resulting from the use of vertical 
restraints by manufacturers included ""(inducing) competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment of capital 
and labor that is often required"" in marketing new products, ""(inducing) retailers to engage in promotional activities or to provide 
service and repair facilities necessary to the efficient marketing of their products,"" and exerting control over distribution and 
service products for safety or quality reasons.  Id. at 55 & n. 23, 97 S. Ct. at 2560 & n. 23. "

274,16," There is some indication from the commentators that the conspiracy between DuKane and Central Sound alone would be 
sufficient to establish a boycott, without considering the combination of the distributors on the horizontal level. Also note that the concept, boycott, as we use it here does not necessarily involve concert of several traders at the level from 
which the victim is excluded.  A boycott always involves concerted action of some kind; otherwise it would not be vulnerable 
under Section 1.  But it is conceivable that only a single firm at the blockaded level may succeed in coercing or inducing 
suppliers or customers (or, for that matter, one important supplier or customer) from dealing with one or more would-be 
competitors of the perpetrator.  Such an arrangement would display all essential elements of a boycott. See, as an example of a 
boycott allegedly perpetrated by a single firm at the blockaded level, Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 
S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959).L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 231 n. 1 (1977). Professor Bauer observed: Section 1 of the Sherman Act imposes the jurisdictional requirement of plurality of conduct.  In satisfying this requirement there 
should be no difference between a combination of competitors and a combination of a supplier and a customer. Both involve two 
or more persons.  The key inquiries instead should be the purpose or intent of the defendants and the effect of the restraint on 
competition. Bauer, Per Se Illegality of Concerted Refusals to Deal: A Rule Ripe for Reexamination, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 689, 713 (1979)

U.S.C. § 14, the defendant does recognize the applicability of both statutes.  Nonetheless, Agrico contests Central's standing as 
to all alleged violations falling under both statutes except for the sole claim arising under 15 U.S.C. § 1, see pp. 10-21, infra, 
concerning Agrico's refusal to deal with Central.  See Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary 
Judgment on Count IV, at 1-3.  Thus, with respect to the tying and exclusive dealing claims about which Agrico does contest 
standing, the requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 15 equally apply to the claims whether they fall under one of the statutes exclusively 
or under § 3 of the Clayton Act as well as § 1 of the Sherman Act."
284,6," .  Agrico argues that there was no contract for sale of goods between Central and Agrico, and that, because this necessary 
element of a § 3 violation was lacking, this claim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Recently, this Court ruled that 
there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether an enforceable contract for the sale of goods existed between the parties; 
consequently, on consideration of the instant motion to dismiss, this argument cannot prevail. Agrico also argues that plaintiff failed to plead that the oral contract in question contained a condition which violates § 3 of the 
Clayton Act. Although this pleading issue need not necessarily be considered in view of the Court's ruling on standing, the Court 
finds that defendant's argument has merit. HN5[
] In order to plead a cause of action under § 3, plaintiff must allege that a contract for sale of goods between Agrico and 
Central, not Agrico and others, was conditioned on a promise of not dealing in the goods of a competitor, as is the case in a 
tying arrangement or in an exclusive dealing transaction.  See, e.g., McElhenney Co. v. Western Auto Supply Co., 269 F.2d 332, 
336 (4 Cir. 1959); Nelson Radio & Supply Co. v. Motorola, Inc., 200 F.2d 911, 913 (5 Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 925, 73 
S. Ct. 783, 97 L. Ed. 1356 (1953); Thomas v. Amerada Hess Corp., 393 F. Supp. 58, 76 (M.D.Pa.1975). Plaintiff claims that P 19(a), (b) of the Amended Complaint, as found in the More Definite Statement, alleges a tying element.  
The Court finds that the cited paragraph alleges only that Agrico generally required contracting parties to tie the purchase of MP 
and urea to the purchase of DAP and GTSP; no specific allegation is made in the Amended Complaint that this condition was 
within the terms of the alleged contract between Central and Agrico.  See also PP 6 and 7 of the Complaint; PP 13, 16 of the 
Amended Complaint.  In fact, the tying allegation relating to MP and urea in P 19(a), (b) is written in the same language as that 
used in P 19(c) which alleges that Agrico tied the purchase of paper bags to the purchase of DAP and GTSP.  Yet, P 16 of the 
Amended Complaint expressly states that a condition relating to paper bags was not a term of the contract between Agrico and 
Central. "
285,," Similarly, P 19(d), (e) of the Amended Complaint refers to a contractual term imposing an exclusive dealing (or five-year) 
requirement.  Paragraph 16 of the same complaint, however, states that the alleged contract between Agrico and Central 
contained no exclusive dealing (or five-year requirement) term. Therefore, it is extremely difficult, if not improper, to interpret the general allegations of P 19 as terms actually imposed in the 
alleged contract between Agrico and Central.  Because plaintiff presents the ""offenses"" which ground its antitrust claims solely 
within P 19, the Court notes that is very difficult to find a condition in Agrico's alleged contract with Central which would 
constitute a cause of action under § 3 of the Clayton Act. Although the Court notes that Agrico's motion to dismiss the § 3 
ground has merit, the Court also notes that under liberal pleading practices Central would have the opportunity to amend its 
Amended Complaint to correct this defect."

injury; he need not eliminate all other causes.  Phillips v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 395 F. Supp. 735, 769 (D.Md.1975). "
287,9," .  Central argues that Agrico should have been required under the antitrust laws to offer a legal contract, one containing no tying 
condition.  In fact, the law is settled that Agrico had no duty to offer any contract, and its failure to offer a legal contract in place 
of the allegedly illegal contract is only actionable if in furtherance of an illegal conspiracy. See discussion infra at p. 543."

and 2 (15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2). Unibrand Tire & Product Co. v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 429 F. Supp. 470, 474 (W.D.N.Y.1977)."

purchased goods under that arrangement, and the Fourth Circuit held that it therefore had standing to complain of the tying 
violations.  286 F.2d at 839-40. That is simply not the case here.  It is important to note that other parties, including purchasers 
under the alleged tying contracts, Agrico's competitors, and the United States have standing to raise such claims."

Rule 56 standard is satisfied.  First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569

288,14," .  Agrico's contracts provided that Agrico had to meet competitive prices from coproducers, but not from wholesalers such as 
Central who would resell raw materials. See Exhibit D to Memorandum of Central Chemical Corporation in Opposition to Motion 
for Summary Judgment on Count IV."
288,15," .  There is evidence from which an inference may be drawn that the agreements were also designed to stabilize prices at a 
higher level in the markets in which Agrico was active."
288,16," .  Central argued at the hearing and in its brief on this motion that in return for the blenders' promise to purchase their 
requirements from Agrico, and further, their promises not to resell raw materials or to market blended materials at the dealer 
level, Agrico promised not to sell produce to any other prospective purchaser who did not enter the conspiracy. Central argued 
that this was a uniform policy of Agrico's and that Agrico made each party to an executive account aware of this fact.  There is 
some evidence from which a jury might infer that Agrico communicated to each blender that the above provisions concerning "
289,," requirements purchasing and marketing limitations were uniform in executive account contracts.  There is no evidence from 
which a jury could infer that this condition was imposed by the blenders as the price of their entering the conspiracy. All of the 
evidence shows that it was Agrico's unilateral decision which determined the terms on which its sales were made.  See Hester v. 
Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 659 F.2d 433, 436 (4 Cir. 1981). Further, it is undisputed that Agrico sold to many purchasers during 
the shortage who did not enter executive accounts.  Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 21 n.24.  Thus, 
although the evidence indicates that Agrico would not award an executive account contract unless all of the above conditions 
were met by the blender, such evidence does not indicate in any way that parties to executive accounts managed to limit 
Agrico's discretion as to sales to parties not entered into executive accounts.  There is, in short, no evidence that the dealers and 
Agrico had any agreement as to which purchasers Agrico would sell material; rather the evidence indicates that Agrico 
unilaterally determined the parties to whom it would sell, and the terms on which its product would be sold.  The agreement 
between the dealers and Agrico for which evidence exists relates only to marketing of goods which Agrico did sell."
289,17," .  It is unclear under what standard a conspiracy such as the one described above should be judged.  Although § 1 of the 
Sherman Act by its terms prohibits all concerted action in restraint of trade, the Act has been construed to prohibit only those 
contracts, combinations, and conspiracies which unreasonably restrain trade.  Although most restraints are judged under ""the 
rule of reason,"" Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 243, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918), some 
restraints have such a pernicious effect on competition that they are judged to be illegal per se.  Horizontal market divisions, for 
example, are illegal per se.  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). In 
contrast, the Supreme Court held in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 58, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2561, 53 L. Ed. 
2d 568 (1977), that vertical restraints were generally to be judged under ""the rule of reason,"" overruling the per se rule applied to 
such restraints by the Supreme Court in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 
1249 (1967). Difficulties arise in choosing the correct standard when a restraint can be characterized as both horizontal and vertical in nature.  
Thus, Agrico, a manufacturer, distributes its own product and employs independent distributors, a marketing scheme which is 
known as ""dual distribution."" Agrico, as a manufacturer, imposes certain restraints on its distributors, and those restraints can be 
viewed as vertical in nature.  Agrico also competes with these independent distributors at the wholesale and dealer levels and 
restraints between competitors are generally viewed as horizontal in nature.  The Supreme Court in Continental was not faced 
with such hybrid restraint, although prior to Continental such restraints were routinely held to be illegal per se.  E.g., American 
Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 (3 Cir. 1975); Hobart Bros. Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 471 F.2d 894 (5 
Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 923, 93 S. Ct. 2736, 37 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1973). Since the Continental decision, the courts have analyzed the legality of restraints in the dual distributorship context in a variety of 
ways.  E.g., Donald B. Rice Tire Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 638 F.2d 15 (4 Cir. 1981) (per curiam); Sherman v. British Leyland 
Motors, Ltd., 601 F.2d 429, 449 (9 Cir. 1979); Dougherty v. Continental Oil Co., 579 F.2d 954, 958-59 (5 Cir. 1978), vacated and 
dismissed by stipulation, 591 F.2d 1206 (5 Cir. 1979); Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2 Cir.) (en banc), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1978); H & B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 
239, 245-46 (5 Cir. 1978); see generally, S. Altschuler, ""Sylvania, Vertical Restraints and Dual Distribution,"" 1980 Antitrust 
Bulletin 1 (1980).  Although the courts initially expended much effort in determining whether such restraints should be 
characterized as vertical or horizontal, this Court is of the opinion that such a characterization is not particularly useful in a dual 
distributorship context.  Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized that certain vertical restraints might have such a pernicious effect 
on competition as to justify application of the per se rule.  Continental, 433 U.S. at 58, 97 S. Ct. at 2561. Instead, then, of 
engaging in a process of mechanical labeling, this Court prefers to scrutinize the effect of restraints on a defendant's interbrand 
(as opposed to intrabrand) competition.  If a court would find (1) that the economic effect of an interbrand restraint is similar to 
that which the courts have condemned as the result of per se illegal activity, and if a court would find (2) that an interbrand 
restraint is a primary necessary, and intended effect of the questioned business practice, then a court should deem the restraint 
to be per se illegal.  The Court, however, will not apply this preferred standard to the instant facts because plaintiff fails to show 
evidence sufficient to link Agrico's refusal to supply Central with a conspiracy to restrain trade between Agrico and parties to the 
executive account agreements. "
291,18," .  In contesting this motion, Central has chiefly relied upon Interphoto Corp. v. Minolta Corp., 295 F. Supp. 711 (S.D.N.Y.) aff'd 
per curiam, 417 F.2d 621 (2 Cir. 1969). In Interphoto, the district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the termination 
of a distributorship.  Interphoto is not contrary to the rule applied in the instant case.  The district court there stated: ""(In) order for 
Minolta's termination of Interphoto's distributorship to be unlawful there must be some causal connection between the alleged 
conspiracy and the refusal to deal."" 295 F. Supp. at 721."
291,19," .  See also Donald B. Rice Tire Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 483 F. Supp. 750 (D.Md.1980), aff'd per curiam, 638 F.2d 15 (4 Cir. 
1981) (termination of distributorship not unilateral act where there was proof of complaints from other dealers about terminated 
dealers' policies)."
291,20," .  Central belatedly suggested that one executive account might have made sales of unspecified products in Central's 
marketing area.  Reply Memorandum of Central Chemical Corporation in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment as to 
Count IV at 20.  The deposition testimony upon which Central relies to make this assertion indicates only that the dealer in 
question, Hudson, thought it was ""possible"" that his company had made some sales in Maryland or Pennsylvania.  Hudson 
Deposition at 42, 50.  From such vague and inconclusive testimony the Court cannot draw an inference that competition actually 
took place between Central and this dealer. For example, even if such sales took place, it is not clear whether the sales were of 
products which Central marketed.  Furthermore, it would be pure speculation to infer that the alleged market allocation scheme 
between Agrico and Hudson was threatened by any marketing activity by Central contrary to the terms of the conspiracy in what 
was at best an occasional and infrequent market for Hudson.  Therefore, this Court concludes that the testimony concerning 
Hudson's possible activities in Central's marketing area is insufficient to raise any inference that Hudson conspired with Agrico to 
cut off supplies to Central. At oral argument Central also argued that two dealers who had ""A-Team"" contracts with Agrico were located in Central's 
marketing area and actually competed with Central.  It is undisputed that Agrico did not award any ""A-Team"" contract, which had 
terms similar to those of the executive accounts, prior to April 1, 1974, or more than a year after Agrico's refusal to sell supplies 
to Central.  Central argues that, because Agrico sold materials to dealers who were considered potential ""A-Term"" accounts 
during FY 1974, and because Agrico's marketing strategy indicated that it would make such sales only to dealers who restricted 
sales to the ultimate consumer, the dealers who eventually became ""A-Team"" accounts were co-conspirators.  The defect in this 
argument is Central's failure to supply any evidence to indicate an agreement between these dealers and Agrico.  Although it is 
true that Agrico's marketing policy indicates at least a preference that dealers restrict sales to the ultimate consumer, this is the "
292,," ""mere announcement"" of a policy even if it is communicated to a dealer. See Parke, Davis, 362 U.S. at 32, 80 S. Ct. at 505. 
There is no evidence that dealers who entered into A-Team accounts in April, 1974 agreed to these terms in order to purchase 
goods in FY 1974.  In contrast, Central has submitted deposition testimony from executive account officials which indicate that 
agreements took place between those dealers and Agrico.  It is undisputed that Agrico sold products during FY 1974 without 
such conditions.  Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment on Count IV of Amended Complaint at 21 n.24.  Absent any 
evidence which suggests an agreement prior to Agrico's refusal to deal with Central between Agrico and any dealers who later 
entered into an A-Team account, the Court must conclude that on the undisputed facts no such agreement or conspiracy 
existed.  See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 1139, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946); Galloway 
v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 395, 63 S. Ct. 1077, 1089, 87 L. Ed. 1458 (1943). Because there is no evidence to suggest such 
an agreement, the fact that dealers who later entered into A-Team accounts with Agrico competed with Central during FY 1974 
is completely irrelevant to Agrico's refusal to deal with Central."
292,21," .  It is true that Agrico could not extend the conspiracy into Central's area without Central's agreement, but this would not 
frustrate or even affect the operation of success of the conspiracy which existed between Agrico and the executive account 
dealers. This factual setting is in marked contrast to that in Engine Specialties, 605 F.2d at 12-13, for example, where the 
evidence indicated that the conspiracy's aim or purpose would be frustrated if the dealer-plaintiff was not terminated.  There is 
no evidence to suggest that the conspiracy between the dealers and Agrico would be affected by Central's refusal to accede to 
the conspiracy's aims, and therefore no possible inference that Agrico's refusal to deal was in furtherance of that conspiracy."
292,22," .  It is noteworthy that the only conspiracy for which Central offers any evidence is an agreement between Agrico and the 
executive account dealers to allocate customers. Under Central's version of this conspiracy, a wholesaler such as Central would 
obtain product from Agrico, regardless of the shortage, if the wholesaler would agree to the terms of the conspiracy. Although Central argues that the dealers would have gained a competitive advantage by Agrico's refusal to sell scarce materials 
to Central, it is clear that this advantage has no connection to the conspiracy between Agrico and the dealers to allocate 
markets.  That is, if Central had agreed to that conspiracy, Central would have received product despite any corresponding 
lessening in the product available to the dealers. The dealers might have been advantaged by Agrico's eventual refusal to deal 
with Central.  Central, however, offers no evidence to indicate that the dealers asked Agrico to terminate supplies to Central.  
There is, in fact, no evidence that any of the dealers in question said anything to Agrico concerning Central's purchase of 
product or its operations in general.  Central raised this argument concerning the dealers' advantage at oral argument on this 
motion.  Significantly, after six years of discovery, Central is able to offer no evidence to support an inference that the dealers 
conspired with Agrico to eliminate Central or to cut off supplies to Central, whether because of the shortage or for any other 
reason.  See, e.g., Edward J. Sweeney, 637 F.2d at 111-112; Aviation Specialties, Inc. v. United Technologies Corp., 568 F.2d 
1186, 1192 (5 Cir. 1978). "
293,23," .  HN17[
] In relevant part, § 2 provides that ""(e)very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize … any part of the trade or commerce … shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
295,24," .  At oral argument, counsel for plaintiff conceded that Central purchased raw materials from two other producers following 
Agrico's refusal to supply.  Central argued that this was not significant to a consideration of Agrico's position as a monopolist, 
because Central had to give up a portion of its supply of scarce potash in return for scarce granulated goods, presumably DAP 
and GTSP.  The Court is of the opinion that this transaction demonstrates precisely the point of the Mullis court; Agrico's supply 
of product was not immune from competition and, even during the shortage, Central had alternative sources.  The fact that 
Central gave up an equally scarce commodity to obtain such product is consistent with the high demand and low supply of a 
shortage situation.  The Court is not sympathetic to plaintiff's argument that a supplier need provide his regular customers at 
regular prices during a shortage situation in order to avoid a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
296,25," .  The withdrawal of this claim is particularly significant.  Initially, Central's major complaint concerned Agrico's attempts to 
enlarge its share of the retail market during the shortage through the executive account contracts.  See White Bag, 579 F.2d at 
1386-87."
296,26," .  The Court is of the opinion that production of DAP and GTSP by cooperatives might well be excluded from the relevant 
market. The Court does not agree with the defendant that the allegation by Central that independent wholesalers had no access 
to the farmer cooperatives' product is legally irrelevant. The primary concern in defining a submarket is whether domination of the product market would enable a defendant to control 
prices and exclude competition.  ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 458 F. Supp. 423 
(N.D.Calif.1978), aff'd sub nom., Memorex Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 636 F.2d 1188 (9 Cir. 1980), cert.

consumers which are most salient in a determination of market boundaries.  Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum &

Circuit recently explained that the goal in ascertaining a relevant market is to ""delineate markets which conform to areas of 
effective competition and to the realities of competitive practice."" Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. v. Ventron Corp., 567 F.2d 701, 
710 (7 Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 822, 99 S. Ct. 87, 58 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1978). Moreover, the Third Circuit explained: (Defining) a relevant product market is a process of describing those groups of producers which, because of the similarity of their 
products, have the ability-actual or potential-to take significant amounts of business away from each other.  A market definition 
must look at all relevant sources of supply, either actual rivals or eager potential entrants to the market. "
297,," Smith-Kline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056, 1063 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 838, 99 S. Ct. 123, 58 L. Ed. 2d 134 
(1978). Agrico argues that one must focus on the ultimate consumer in defining a product market.  This is not, however, the market in 
which Central alleges that Agrico is attempting to monopolize.  Rather, Central argues that Agrico is attempting to monopolize 
the market supplying DAP and GTSP to independent wholesalers. If independent wholesalers cannot purchase such materials 
from cooperatives, then the cooperatives would not in fact effectively compete in that market.  Thus, if Agrico were the only non-
cooperative producer, and sought to control prices and exclude competition in the wholesale market, the fact that the 
cooperatives also produced such materials would not prevent Agrico from taking such action, if in fact the cooperatives could not 
sell to the independent wholesalers. See Otter Tail, 410 U.S. at 369-70 nn. 1, 3, 93 S. Ct. at 1025-26 nn. 1, 3. Because Agrico 
could, under certain facts, exercise monopoly power in the wholesale market, the Court does not find Central's contentions as to 
wholesalers' lack of access to cooperatives' products to be legally irrelevant.  A factual issue is presented, however, as to 
whether the cooperatives are in any manner barred from selling product to independent wholesalers."
297,27," .  Central also presents an ""adjustment"" of these figures based on its assumption that cooperatives were producing DAP at a 
higher capacity than non-cooperatives, and that their proportionate share of the total DAP market was higher than the 
government figures indicated, which would mean that the non-cooperative market for DAP was smaller than the figures 
indicated.  On this assumption Central increased Agrico's share to reflect its position in the alleged smaller market.  Id. at 49-50.  
The factual assumption on which this adjustment is made is faulty.  Reply Memorandum of Agrico at 16 n.17.  Even assuming 
that the assumption is correct, the actual mathematical manipulation of the figures at issue is not explained.  The Court, 
therefore, will not consider these figures, although it is of the opinion that they would not compel a different result. "
298,28," .  Likewise, Central's reliance on Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F.2d 579 (7 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 
405 U.S. 1066, 92 S. Ct. 1500, 31 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1972) is misplaced.  In Kearney, the defendant used a fraudulently obtained 
patent as leverage in attempting to acquire monopoly power in the multifunction machine tool industry.  Id. at 599-600."
298,29," .  Central argues that Agrico's position as a basic producer of phosphate rock, phosphoric acid, anhydrous ammonia and urea, 
along with Agrico's ability to ""extract"" long-term requirements contracts from its customers, are factors which indicate that 
Agrico's market share understates its actual market power.  Certainly the fact that Agrico offers long-term requirements contracts 
with terms beyond a projected shortage does not by itself indicate that Agrico has monopoly power; there is no evidence to 
suggest that other producers did not employ such long-term contracts.  Undisputed evidence indicates that at least one other 
domestic producer had a large mining capacity, see Memorandum in Opposition at 53, and that Agrico produces only 5% to 7% 
of the phosphoric acid in the Eastern United States.  Bodoff Affidavit at 9.  Correspondingly, there is no evidence to support 
Central's assertions as to the effect of Agrico's mining capacity on its market position. "
307,1," .  In 1947, the television networks recognized the Radio Directors Guild as the collective bargaining representative of television 
staff directors and associate directors.  In 1952, after the Radio Directors Guild changed its name to the Radio and Television 
Directors Guild, the major networks recognized it as the collective bargaining representative of staff and freelance television and 
radio directors, as well as of other categories of employees.  Def.Exs. 12, 13, 21, 27, 29, 30; Gordon Tr. 1608. "

working conditions of any Guild agreement"" or ""to accept employment below minimums"" or to ""work with non-signatories."" Id. at 
17-18 (art. IX, § B3-B5).  Article X of the Guild's constitution and by-laws authorizes the Guild to censure, fine, suspend, or expel 
members for violations of these prohibitions.  Id. at 18-19. "
309,3," .  The letter informed Guild members that HBO had ""refused to negotiate a contract with the Guild"" and warned that, under 
threat of disciplinary action, they ""may not accept employment … in any Guild category"" with HBO and must report ""any 
employment proposal with any other production company which may involve a program intended for use by Home Box Office."" 
Pl.Ex. 43 (emphasis in original).  The threat of the May 18 letter was repeated in letters dated June 21, 1978, and August 25, 
1978.  Pl.Exs. 44, 45.  In addition, the Guild issued warnings against working in a Guild capacity for any nonsignatory in its 
newsletters of April 1978, Pl.Ex. 48 at 6, of September 1978, Pl.Ex. 49 at 6, of December 1978, Pl.Ex. 50 at 1, 6 (noting in 
particular that HBO is a nonsignatory), and of July 1979, Pl.Ex. 52 at 6, 8 (same).  The newsletters of December 1978 and of 
February 1979 directly warn, ""Do not work for these nonsignatory companies,"" and list HBO as a nonsignatory. Pl.Ex. 50 at 1; 
Pl.Ex. 51 at 1."
309,4," .  The May 18, 1978 letter prohibited ""employment (either directly or through your own loan-out company ) in any Guild category 
with Home Box Office"" and noted that the prohibition applied even to signatory loan-out companies.  Pl.Ex. 43.  The same 
warnings were repeated in letters of June 21, 1978, and August 25, 1978.  Pl.Exs. 44, 45.  A letter dated August 29, 1978, 
reminded Guild members that the pay-television bargaining provision of the Freelance Agreement applied to loan-out 
companies.  Pl.Ex. 46.  And the Guild newsletters of April 1978, December 1978, and July 1979 all contain warnings that loan-
out companies may not lend Guild member services to nonsignatories such as HBO.  Pl.Ex. 48 at 2, 5, 6; Pl.Ex. 50 at 6; Pl.Ex. 
52 at 6.  In December 1978 the Guild initiated disciplinary action against Joshua White, who it believed was ""employed as a 
director, either directly or on a loan-out basis, by Home Box Office."" Pl.Ex. 58.  White was found guilty and fined in 1979.  Pl.Ex. 
34."
309,5," .  All of the Guild's warnings to free-lance directors were based on article II, section H8, and article IX, sections B3-B5, of the 
Guild constitution and by-laws.  See Pl. Ex. 27.  Between November 1978 and March 1979, for example, Michael Franklin sent 
letters to Dwight Hemion, Josef Bernay, Lee Gabler, Michael Ovitz, Jerome Katzman, and Richard Goldstone, advising them 
that no Guild member may work for nonsignatories such as HBO.  Pl. Exs. 53-55, 62-64.  The seriousness of the Guild's efforts 
is further evidenced by a memorandum dated January 19, 1979, from Franklin to the Assistant Directors Unit Production 
Managers Council West, which reports that on January 13, 1979, the Guild's National Board requested that the Council West 
""strictly enforce disciplinary actions against members who are found guilty of working for non-signatory companies."" Pl. Ex. 67. "
310,6," .  In September 1978, Franklin wrote to Tim Kiley that he was informing the Directors Council that Kiley had worked for a 
nonsignatory as a director on a pay-television program.  Pl.Ex. 75.  The Guild instituted disciplinary proceedings against Charles 
Braverman in December 1978, charging him with having worked as a director for a nonsignatory production company.  Pl.Ex. 91.  
The Guild fined Braverman $ 13,804.00.  Pl.Exs. 92, 93.  In the same month, Franklin told Donald Davis that he may not work for 
Showtime (a pay-television company), and Davis consequently rejected Showtime's offer of employment.  Pl.Ex. 68.  Joshua 
White also was the subject of a Guild warning, disciplinary proceeding, and fine.  Pl.Exs. 58-61. "
318,7," .  The language in the Guild agreements defining the functions of directors, which makes them ""(subject) … to the supervision 
and control of the Producer,"" Pl.Ex. 38 at 6, see Def. Ex. 48 at 37 (""Employer's decision in all business and creative matters shall 
be final""), originated at the insistence of the television networks in 1952 negotiations.  Kane Tr. 1525-26. "
323,8," .  HBO has not shown how many of those commonly called director-packagers actually meet its definition.  Indeed, with respect 
to the most important characteristic-assuming the risk of loss on the packaged program, the evidence indicates that few such 
director-packagers qualify under HBO's definition.  See Cates Tr. 860; Furst Tr. 62-67; Fuchs Tr. 209-19; Evans Tr. 617-21.  For 
purposes of analysis, this Court adopts HBO's abstract definition, treating its relation to the real world of the television industry 
as speculative. "
326,9, .  The Freelance Agreement version states: 
327,," In the event that the employer shall desire to engage any Director (,) Associate Director or Stage Manager for programs 
intended primarily for release on pay-type CATV, Pay Television or for cassettes, to be released in Supplemental Markets, the 
Employer will give the Guild notice of such desire no later than sixty days prior to the date upon which it intends to engage any 
such employee. Guild and Employer shall thereafter meet and bargain in good faith for the purpose of agreeing upon the terms and conditions of 
employment and compensation for such employees engaged by the Employer, and if no agreement is reached between 
Employer and Guild with respect thereto, Guild may upon sixty (60) days written notice to Employer, instruct its members to 
refuse to render services with respect to the production of any such programs. Pl. Ex. 38 at 98.  The Basic Agreement version differs only in that it applies to film.  Def. Ex. 48 at 132-33."
327,10," .  HBO's papers may also be read as challenging the union security clauses in the Guild agreements.  Pl. Ex. 38 at 13 
(Freelance Agreement art. IV, § A); Def. Ex. 48 at 6 (Basic Agreement § 1-301).  Such clauses are explicitly approved by section 
8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3) (1976), and are therefore exempt from antitrust challenge.  
See Jou-Jou Designs, Inc. v. International Ladies Garment Workers Union, supra, 643 F.2d at 910. "

television system (such as Home Box Office or Showtime) as herein set forth, not less than the following compensation: (i) The applicable minimum network prime time rate specified in Article VI, plus (ii) an additional sum equal to the difference between the amount specified in (i) above and four percent (4%) of the gross 
revenue derived by the Company from licensing the exhibition of the program on pay television. Company represents that its 
gross revenue for licensing the exhibition of the program on pay television will be not less than $ ________. Pl. Ex. 76. "
329,12," .  For example, from 1948 to 1960, the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild of America, and the Directors Guild all secured a 
percentage of gross license fees from the licensing of theatrical motion pictures for exhibition on television. Franklin Tr. 980-84.  
Similar arrangements for supplemental use of television programs became common beginning in the early 1960s.  Franklin Tr.

exhibition days on any one pay television system in the United States in any market within a single six-month period.  Said six-
month period shall commence with the first exhibition day which shall mean any calendar day in which the program is exhibited 
one or more times in the market in question.  Under no circumstances may Company license the program for any exhibition day

334,17," .  The complexities and uncertainties of labor-antitrust law have reached such proportions that perhaps courts should begin 
their analysis of such cases by examining whether an antitrust violation warranting injunction has been alleged or shown, even if 
the conduct is nonexempt.  The extensive analysis and consideration of labor law analogies, as well as of the labor-antitrust 
precedents, would thus be avoided in all cases except those in which an unreasonable restraint on the product market 
warranting equitable relief is proved.  Of course, the irony in this suggestion is that the labor exemption was presumably 
designed sharply and clearly to curtail the application of antitrust laws in situations where labor has acted unilaterally or obtained 
agreements with employers at arm's length and that apply only to the relevant bargaining unit.  The Supreme Court's willingness 
to apply those laws to situations regulated by labor laws-whether permitted or prohibited-may largely have deprived the 
exemption of its potentially salutary purposes, without providing significant compensating advantages, since Congress, the 
NLRB, and the courts can in the future, as they have repeatedly done in the past, check labor actions inconsistent with the public 
interest through labor-law proscriptions.  Compare generally Winter, Collective Bargaining and Competition: Application of 
Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L.J. 14 (1963) (fundamental questions of labor policy should be left to labor 
legislation) with Meltzer, Labor Unions, Collective Bargaining, and the Antitrust Laws, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 659 (1965) (excessive 
union power unlikely to be effectively checked by general antitrust laws but labor law coverage and antitrust law coverage 
should not be mutually exclusive). "
342,1," Conrail also moves this court to allow ""for oral argument of its motion."" It is concluded that the written submissions, including 
responses to this court's questions of June 23, 1981, obviate the need for an oral hearing."
342,2," Third-party plaintiffs additionally allege that any prior injury to Pinney was solely the result of unilateral action by Conrail's 
predecessors, Penn Central Transportation Company and New York Central Railroad Company."
342,3," Third-party plaintiffs concede, in light of  Texas Industries v. Radcliff Materials,     U.S.    , 68 L. Ed. 500, 513 (1981), that 
HN1[
] under the antitrust laws there is no right of contribution between federal antitrust violators. All claims for contribution as "
343,," to federal antitrust violations are therefore dismissed.  However, the court has today overruled defendant Bessemer's motion to 
dismiss the plaintiffs' Valentine Act claims.  Therefore, the court's subsequent discussion relates to third-party plaintiffs' state 
contribution and state and federal indemnification claims. "
346,4," HN20[
] Antitrust liability has been held to be joint and several.  See  In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. 2d 1248, 1257 (7th Cir. 1980)."
346,5," The legislature's treatment of joint tortfeasors who reach settlements in good faith buttresses this interpretation.  O.R.C.  § 
2307.32(F) HN23[
] in part ""discharges"" a joint tortfeasor ""who settles in good faith"" from ""all liability for contribution to any 
other tortfeasor."" This section necessarily contemplates that a joint tortfeasor whose settlement was not in good faith is liable for 
contribution.  Such liability attaches despite the tortfeasor's never having become a judgment debtor in an action brought by the 
injured party. "
348,6," The Eighth Circuit in Professional Beauty Supply discussed the policy behind denying indemnity to antitrust violators: ""In  Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., supra, 392 U.S. at 138-39, 88 S. Ct. 1981, the Supreme Court 
emphasized that the public interest and statutory aim of deterring antitrust violations and enforcing the antitrust laws are of 
paramount importance.  To allow indemnification would dilute the deterrant impact of the antitrust laws. Only a realistic possibility 
of liability for damages will encourage compliance with the antitrust laws and will protect the public interest in preserving 
competition.  Consequently, even if one joint tortfeasor bears greater responsibility for the wrongdoing, a person who violates the 
antitrust statutes should not be entitled to full indemnification from the more culpable third party."""
348,594, F. 2d at 1186. 
349,7," Chessie argues that  E.E.O.C. v. McLean Trucking Co., 525 F. 2d 1007 (6th Cir. 1975), requires Conrail's joinder. In McLean, 
the EEOC alleged that Teamster Union locals were signatories to collective bargaining agreements which perpetuated racial 
discrimination, and therefore necessary parties in an employment discrimination suit against a trucking company.  The unions 
argued that they could not properly be joined because they had not been named in the original discrimination charge.  The Sixth 
Circuit ruled that the unions were ""indispensable parties,"" and should be joined to aid in ""interpreting the collective bargaining 
agreements."" The case presently before this court is fundamentally different from McLean. Plaintiff Pinney has chosen to settle with Conrail 
rather than pursue a legal remedy.  Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit was concerned in McLean with ""[disposing of the matter] in 
one proceeding ""in the interest of uniformity and in consideration of the time, effort, and expense involved in duplication.'""  Id. at 
1012. Such concerns are not present in this case. "
354,1," The draft is a selection system whereby the respective NFL teams are awarded the initial rights to negotiate exclusively with 
football players graduating from college. The option clause is a provision of the NFL standard player contract which grants the team the right to renew a player's contract 
for one additional year if the team and player cannot agree to a new contract. After the option year expires, the player becomes 
a ""free agent"" and may negotiate and contract with teams of another league or with other NFL teams subject to the Rozelle rule. "
355,," The Rozelle rule is named after the NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle. This rule provides if a free agent contracts with another 
NFL team, the new team must compensate the player's former team with draft choice(s) or other player contracts. If the new and 
former teams cannot agree as to the compensation, the commissioner arbitrates the matter and determines the compensation. The tampering rule prohibits a NFL team from negotiating with a player currently under contract with another NFL team. Also, if 
one team has the exclusive right to negotiate with a player, no other team may tamper with that player. The one-man rule refers to the commissioner's authority to compel a player to adhere to terms of an operative collective 
bargaining agreement between the players and NFL teams."
355,2," This second collective bargaining agreement was negotiated concurrently with antitrust suits brought by players against the 
NFL. The most significant case, Alexander v. National Football League (D.Minn. 1977) 1977-2 Trade Cases (CCH) 61,730, was 
a class action. Alexander incorporates a settlement which substantially modifies the practices and rules Partee challenges. 
Thus, most of the problems with unreasonable trade practices are currently obviated by the settlement. The settlement also 
contains a covenant not to sue (in antitrust) by the class members. However, Partee who filed this suit before the specified cutoff 
date chose not to be a class member. This agreement terminates in mid-1982. "
356,3," HN2[
] The two aspects of traditional preemption doctrine both focus on congressional intent. (1) If Congress clearly 
manifests an intent to occupy exclusively an area of law (e.g., immigration, postal regulations), states may not regulate. (2) If no 
such congressional intent is manifested, states have concurrent power and may regulate. However, state laws which conflict 
with federal laws are preempted. (See, generally, Nowak, Rotunda & Young, Constitutional Law (1978) p. 267.) "
357,4," As considered by the trial court in Flood v. Kuhn, supra , baseball's reserve system had many of the attributes of the NFL rules 
and practices of which Partee complains. Baseball's reserve system involved an agreement by all of the teams to be involved in 
a draft creating exclusive bargaining rights in the club as to the draftee; a uniform player's contract empowering the signing club 
unilaterally to renew a player's contract from year to year; denial of any right in a player, once signed, to negotiate with any other 
team; a prescribed number of players per team; and the unilateral right of a team to assign the contract to another team (see 
Flood v. Kuhn, supra , 316 F.Supp. 271, 273-275). "
358,5," ""Application and enforcement of a state antitrust law to decisions of the league . . .  would conflict with the national policy in 
this segment of interstate commerce. . . . Other members of the court prefer the view that [professional baseball activities] require uniformity of regulation, and since 
organized baseball operates widely in interstate commerce, the regulation . . .  [if any] must be prescribed by Congress."" ( 
Milwaukee Braves, Inc., supra , 144 N.W.2d at pp. 17-18.) "
359,6," The federal courts have in fact supplied professional football players with ample antitrust protection. (See, e.g., Smith v. Pro 
Football, Inc. (D.C.Cir. 1978) 593 F.2d 1173, 1177, 1183-1187; Kapp v. National Football League (9th Cir. 1978) 586 F.2d 644, 
648-650; Mackey v. National Football League (8th Cir. 1976) 543 F.2d 606, 616-618, 622; Alexander v. National Football 
League (D.Minn. 1977) 1977-2 Trade Cases (CCH) 61,730.) On termination of the present collective bargaining agreement, any 
antitrust violations will be subject to review by the federal courts. "
370,1," .  The traditional definition of practices subject to the per se rule is set forth in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 
1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958): (T)here are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming 
value are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they 
have caused or the business excuse for their use. Although the definition literally refers to a ""lack of any redeeming value,"" the court believes that the real issue, as indicated by 
the cited language from Broadcast Music, supra, is whether the practice may in any way be said to promote competition.  
""(Business excuses)"" may provide ""redeeming"" virtues but they do not lead to the intensification of competitive conditions.  
Similarly, the Court's reference to a finding that a practice has ""no purpose except the stifling of competition,"" see White Motor 
Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S. Ct. 696, 702, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1962), focuses on the absence of any 
procompetitive purpose.  See Parts II(A-2) & III(A), infra. "
371,," HN3[
] - "
373,2," .  Summary judgment for plaintiff may even be granted where the rule of reason applies, if the challenged practice is so patently 
unreasonable that no genuine issue remains for trial.  See, e.g., Kapp v. National Football League, 390 F. Supp. 73, 82, 
(N.D.Cal.1974), aff'd on other grounds, 586 F.2d 644 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1996, 60 L. Ed. 2d 
375 (1979)."
373,3," .   State of Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 643 F.2d 553 (9th Cir. 1980), does not preclude the granting of a partial 
summary judgment in this case.  In Maricopa County plaintiff challenged the actions of two foundations for medical care in 
setting maximum fees that physician members may claim in full payment for health services they provide to policyholders of 
foundation-approved insurance plans.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of summary judgment, declining on 
that motion to declare the practice per se illegal price-fixing. However, in contrast to the extensive record developed here, the 
record in Maricopa County ""reveal(ed) nothing about the actual competitive effects of the challenged arrangement nor do the 
authorities, primary or secondary, afford assurance concerning its competitive impact."" Id. at 556-57. The court also premised 
the decision on its uncertainty about the structure of competition that should exist within the health care industry in view of the 
fact that the professions have only recently been brought by the Supreme Court within the reach of the Sherman Act. Id. at 556, 
560 (Kennedy, J., concurring). "
374,4," .  The district court in Cinema-Tex made three additional findings regarding splits that also do not appear to be contested on the 
present record: 1) that the split could not guarantee that any exhibitor would ultimately be able to license a particular film since 
the final decision on licensing rested with the distributors; 2) split agreements did not require distributors to deal only with split 
members, or to forego the right to solicit bids from any exhibitors; and 3) that the exhibitors could have ended the split at any 
time by responding to invitations to bid from the distributors. 414 F. Supp. at 642-43. The legal significance of these aspects of 
split agreements will be analyzed in Section B of this Part of the opinion. It is significant to note that in spite of the above qualifications on the restrictiveness of splits, the court in Cinema-Tex found that 
distributors could deal only with the exhibitor who was awarded the picture in the split unless negotiations with that exhibitor 
were ""non-productive"" and therefore the distributor was able to solicit bids from other exhibitors. Id. at 643. It is also worthy of 
note that testimony in the case disclosed that splits originated out of the dissatisfaction of exhibitors with the competitive bidding 
process, particularly the ""large cash guarantees which the exhibitors were required to put up to get pictures."" Id. at 641-42."
374,5," .  Counsel for General Cinema emphasized, however, that the Cinema-Tex findings were incomplete in that they did not include 
participation by the distributors. Indeed, the Cinema-Tex court found that distributors were not part of the split and continued in 
spite of the split to solicit bids which were ignored by the exhibitor members of the split. Id. at 642. The impact on the legality of 
splits of distributor participation or consent will be discussed in Part IV of the opinion."
374,6," .  General Cinema does not directly address this point in its briefs, even though it was squarely raised by Requests IA and IB of 
the court's order of April 3, 1981.  General Cinema makes substantial efforts to demonstrate the ""flexibility"" and lack of ""rigidity"" 
in split arrangements, but makes no direct denial in either their voluminous briefs or evidentiary packets of the proposition that all 
split agreements contemplate that members of the split will refrain from competing with the split designee for a particular picture 
while the designee continues to seek a license. For example, on pages 24 and 25 of its April 28, 1981, brief, General Cinema 
asserts that ""Splits may co-exist with bidding. For example, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, some exhibitors are splitting product at the 
same time that General Cinema bids for pictures (Michael Decl. (Tab Y) P 8).  Clearly in this type of situation, no distributor 
could argue it was ever forced to deal with a split designee against its wishes."" But the Michael Declaration to which the passage 
refers merely indicates that splits do not always include all exhibitors in a given area.  Thus, General Cinema's argument, as 
elsewhere in its briefs, serves to obscure but not deny the restraint on competition that is central to all splits. "
377,7," .  The Supreme Court in National Society did not expressly relate its holding to the per se prohibition of price-fixing, but this 
court believes that a number of factors compel the conclusion that the per se rule, and not rule of reason analysis, was applied in 
that case.  Both the district court and the D.C. Circuit relied on the per se illegal price-fixing theory, see 555 F.2d 978, 983 
(D.C.Cir.1977), and the Supreme Court borrowed language from the lower courts that is indicative of the per se rule, such as, for 
example, that the practice is ""illegal on its face,"" see 435 U.S. at 686, 692-93, 98 S. Ct. at 1362, 1365-66. Even though the 
district court after a trial made a number of detailed findings about the defendant Society and the challenged ethical rule, it 
expressly refused to undertake a factual inquiry into the Society's proffered justifications for the practice, and therefore did not 
balance anticompetitive and procompetitive effects to determine the ""reasonableness"" of the restraint.  Id. at 685-86, 98 S. Ct. at 
1362. The Supreme Court approved the district court's refusal to examine the asserted benefits under the rule of reason. Id. at 
693-96, 98 S. Ct. at 1366-67. In addition, the Court's subsequent decision in Catalano, supra, strongly suggests, if not explicitly 
states, that National Society involved an application of the per se rule. 446 U.S. at 645-48, 100 S. Ct. at 1926-28. "
379,8," .  The Eighth Circuit in Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas Theatre Co., 585 F.2d 877, 885 (8th Cir. 1978), describes grossing 
potential of a theater as ""(t)he most important factor in licensing a film."" A theater's location, quality of furnishings, seating 
capacity, demonstrated ability to attract patrons, and the type of films previously shown are factors considered by a distributor in 
determining grossing potential.  Id. "

Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price Fixing and Market Division, 74 Yale L.J. 775, 826 & n.162 (1965) (""the "
384,," apparent desire by the government to soften competition in order to protect exhibitors"" with respect to splits is ""in sharp contrast 
to the usual insistence of the courts and the government on the per se illegality of horizontal market division""); Gordon, 
Horizontal and Vertical Restraints of Trade: The Legality of Motion Picture Splits under the Antitrust Laws, 75 Yale L.J. 239, 250 
(1966) (""It is … beyond cavil that splitting interferes with the pricing mechanism by substituting private agreements not to 
compete for competitive price making.""). "
386,10," .  After carefully examining the arguments of counsel and the record, the court agrees with Buena Vista's alternative position 
that, as in National Society, no factual inquiry at trial should be conducted regarding these asserted benefits because none can 
properly be considered under the rule of reason. See 435 U.S. at 686, 693-94, 98 S. Ct. at 1362, 1366. Any factual issues raised 
by the six justifications are therefore not material to the legality of splits, and the court need not consider further the factual basis 
for these justifications before rejecting them and declaring splits to be per se illegal.  See id. at 681, 98 S. Ct. at 1360. "
387,11," .  According to the oft-quoted language from Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra, at 238, 38 S. Ct. at 243. ""The true 
test of legality (under the rule of reason) is whether the restraint is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition."" "
388,12," .  In this regard it is interesting to note that the memorandum of the eight distributors who have participated as amici curiae in 
strong language denied General Cinema's contention that distributors participate and consent to splits because they benefit from 
them: "
389,," … the Distributors are adamantly opposed to, and have not, do not and will not participate or acquiesce in any exhibitor split 
arrangement.  The Distributors regard any and all exhibitor splits as horizontal, anticompetitive agreements among competitors 
aimed at the Distributors, which are competitively indistinguishable from price fixing, bid rigging, and customer allocation 
schemes.  The injury suffered by the Distributors as a consequence of splits is direct and substantial. Memorandum of Avco Embassy, et al. in Support of Conditional Motion to Participate as Amici Curiae, at 3-4. "

] To obtain standing to seek injunctive relief the plaintiff must ""demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an 
impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely to continue or recur."" Zenith Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 395 U.S. at 130, 89 S. Ct. at 1580. General Cinema's asserted termination of its participation in splits since the 
Justice Department's change of position in no way precludes a finding of threatened injury here.  General Cinema has publicly 
noted its disagreement with the Justice Department's position and its intention to abide by that position only as long as required 
to do so: In April of 1977 the Justice Department issued a statement that product splitting will be considered a per se violation of the anti-
trust laws….  This practice has been a tradition in the industry since the Paramount Consent Decree of 1946 and has been 
countenanced and in some instances encouraged by the Justice Department or the courts for a period of thirty years.  We 
expect that the Justice Department's position will be challenged in the courts.  In the meantime, however, the Justice 
Department's position has created uncertainty in the industry and conceivably will add somewhat to film costs. General Cinema Corp., Annual Report (1977), in Buena Vista Appendix (April 27, 1981), at 237. Moreover, the fervor and vehemence with which General Cinema has alleged the competitive benefits of splits and defended its 
past conduct throughout this action indicate to the court that any cessation of participation in the splitting process is only 
temporary.  General Cinema and other exhibitors cannot reasonably be expected to give up voluntarily a practice which has 
been an industry ""tradition"" for years and which they consider to be highly advantageous.  Nor can the Justice Department's 
position, subject as it is to political fluctuations and changing administrations, provide an adequate check against future split 
agreements. "
394,," The court is therefore convinced that Buena Vista has demonstrated a real possibility of continued violations of the antitrust 
laws.  Because of Buena Vista's unequivocal decision, as demonstrated by this segment of the lawsuit, not to participate in any 
future split agreements, General Cinema cannot argue, as it has with regard to past splits, that Buena Vista's alleged 
participation or consent offsets or precludes a finding of any damages.  The clear anticompetitive purpose and effect of splits 
and the great likelihood that General Cinema will continue to participate in future splits thus creates a ""significant threat of injury"" 
to Buena Vista. "

U.S. at 139-41, 88 S. Ct. at 1984-1985. Thus, if Texaco and its dealers had engaged in concerted action to restrain trade, the 
dealers' involvement would not prevent them from successfully bringing suit against Texaco.  However, the evidence presented 
at trial showed no concerted action between the parties.  In Perma Life, the plaintiffs were found to have willingly joined with the 
defendants in a long-running series of acts alleged to have restrained trade.  392 U.S. at 138, 88 S. Ct. at 1984, citing Seventh 
Circuit opinion, 376 F.2d at 699. Since that situation is not before this Court, Perma Life is not applicable to this case. "

Batavia regarding the reasonableness of a retail class which blankets all industrials regardless of their individual peak 
characteristics.  The court's concern appears to be that group subsidies within the industrial class may work to the disadvantage 
of the wholesale class.  This is a proper concern.  It would be a matter to be remedied if that part of the industrial class for which 
the wholesale customer wished to compete were being subsidized by higher rates to that part of the industrial class for which the 
wholesale customer did not wish to compete. There is no evidence that this situation prevails in this case. "
428,9," R. 5361-5400.  Specifically Cities contend that Com Ed's cost of service study was invalid because (1) it used retail revenues 
for subsequent periods beyond the test period to obtain a comparable return on equity to that earned by resale revenues in the 
actual 1974 test year, and (2) it was based upon estimated coincident demand data for Com Ed's 225,000 retail customers. See 
pp. 52-53 infra. R. 5418."
428,10," The Commission rejected Cities' objection to the use of post-test retail rates and to the use of estimated wholesale and retail 
coincident peak demands: The load estimates which underlie the compliance filing were based on sampling and class load estimating methodologies 
routinely used by the Com Ed for its own purposes and in class cost of service studies for retail rate proceedings before the 
Illinois Commission.  Com Ed's method of developing the estimates of retail coincident demand appears to be reasonable 
considering the data available."
428,11," The Commission stated: We had before us the compliance filing, Cities' objections to the compliance filing, Com Ed's response to the objections along 
with testimony and affidavits of its witnesses.  Since the issue raised by the Cities would rise or fall on the validity of their 
statistical method, a hearing was not necessary to resolve such issues upon a finding that their statistical method was invalid. R. 5490."
428,12," The Commission's jurisdictional challenge does not extend to our authority to determine whether there is an unjustified or 
illegal price squeeze. Final agency action on the price squeeze issue was not taken until February 2, 1981, R. 5489, and a 
petition for review of that action was timely filed with this court on March 6, 1981.  The Commission did not conclude the price 
squeeze issue with Opinion Nos. 63 and 63-A because it determined that additional information on that issue was required.  R. 
5019-20.  Only after the Commission accepted Com Ed's compliance filing, R. 5416, and determined that there was no 
anticompetitive price discrimination, could Cities appeal the Commission's final disposition of that issue.  When Cities appealed 
the final agency action on the price squeeze issue, we consolidated that appeal with their January 16th appeal from Opinion No. 
63-A, which raised price squeeze as well as non-price squeeze issues."
428,13," In response to that petition, the Commission also argued that the price squeeze and tax normalization issues were not yet ripe 
for review.  FERC Brief, September 11, 1980, at 20-25. "
429,14," Cities have cast substantial doubt upon the issue date of Opinion No. 63-A.  According to the records of Cities' counsel, 
Opinion No. 63-A was not delivered across town to Cities' counsel until November 30, 1979, two weeks after the Commission 
contends the Opinion issued.  See Affidavit of Carol Vodra, Cities Supp'l Brief, October 15, 1980, Appendix B.  See also 
Appendix C.  While Cities do not dispute that the Opinion was placed in inter-office mail on November 16, they question whether 
it was given to the United States Postal Service on that day.  See Affidavits of Louis D.  Cashell and Ray A. Huber, FERC Supp'l 
Brief, Appendices A and B; Cities Supp'l Brief, October 15, 1980 at 2-3.  The Cashell Affidavit states that ""[e]ach time an opinion 
is mailed out, the words 'service-issued' are stamped on the card and the date of mailing and opinion number are written in."" The 
affidavit goes on to state that ""[t]he 'service cards'… indicate that one copy of Opinion No. 63-A was mailed… on November 16, 
1979."" The affidavit does not explain whether ""mailed"" means placed in the United States mail or simply placed in inter-office 
mail.  It does not dispose of the real possibility that the Opinion may not have been deposited in the United States Mail until, at 
best, the day after it was placed in inter-office mail.Cf. 18 C.F.R.  § 1.17(d) (""The date of service shall be the day when the 
matter served is deposited in the United States mail…"").  Thus, on the basis of the record before us, we would be unable to 
determine whether Opinion No. 63-A did, in fact, issue on November 16.  For the reasons below, we need not resolve that 
problem.  We should note, however, that if we were confronted with that problem -- i.e., if we had to decide whether the Opinion 
issued on November 16 for jurisdictional reasons -- we might not dismiss issues so important to the price squeeze issue (which 
the Commission concedes is now legitimately raised) as well as to whether the wholesale rate was ""just and reasonable"" but for 
the price squeeze, unless the Commission, as movant, were able to resolve our doubts about the issue date of Opinion No. 63-
A."
429,15," While a petition from an agency order cannot be filed after the statutory period for filing has run, it may be that some of the 
issues that might have been raised in that appeal are so inextricably linked to a subsequent agency opinion on another aspect of 
the same case, that those issues may be raised in a timely appeal from the second opinion.  For example, the demand allocation 
issue in this case is not only an important element of Opinion No. 63-A, but of the agency's price squeeze decision.  Therefore, 
even if Cities' appeal from Opinion No. 63-A were not timely filed, Cities might still have been able to raise the demand allocation 
issue in their timely appeal from the agency's final action on the price squeeze issue."

430,19," The ALJ's decision against Cities was upheld but on different grounds.  The ALJ understood Cities' argument to be based 
upon alleged imprudent judgment by Com Ed's management in developing excessive reserve capacity.  R. 4646.  The 
Commission recognized that Cities' position went further and would deny Com Ed recovery of even certain prudently incurred 
capital carrying charges.  R. 4971."
430,20," R. 4975.  Cities' use of the term ""normalization"" instead of ""adjustment"" caused the Commission to respond to an argument, 
not presented by Cities although perhaps supportable, that the rate base ought to have been normalized to reallocate the cost of 
excess capacity to those who will actually benefit from it.  Normalization is an accounting device by which expenses are 
distributed over a period of time in a different manner from that by which they are incurred.  Cf. pp. 23-29 infra (tax 
normalization).  As the Commission recognized, it is arguable that customers taking power at the beginning of a cycle are paying 
for capacity costs incurred for the benefit of customers at the end of the cycle and therefore an interperiod reallocation is 
appropriate.  This is because: In order to achieve economics of scale, utilities characteristically add capacity in large lumps.  As a result, when a new facility 
first goes on line, the utility may well have a significant amount of spare capacity.  This spare capacity is gradually consumed by 
load growth, so that at the end of the cycle the utility is maintaining the bare minimum reserves. R. 4973.  The Commission did not pursue the theory because it was neither suggested by Cities nor sustained by the record.  To 
sustain such a theory, the Commission noted that The analysis and calculation would not be simple, however.  Among the factors that might have to be taken into account are the 
following: the possibility of irregular growth in demand; a discrepancy between the length of the described expansion cycle and 
the period between rate applications; fuel expense savings accruing to the benefit of customers in the early years of the "
431,," expansion cycle due to the ""premature"" addition of presumably efficient new capacity; the fact that capital carrying charges per 
unit of capacity do not stay constant due to depreciation; and some recognition of the fact that customers in the early years 
receive some of the benefits of the economies of scale that were a basis for the decision to add capacity in a large lump. R. 4974 n.7."

A, 530-B and the Order Denying Rehearing of Order No. 530-B (which announced that the general policy allowing normalization 
would be prospective)."
435,31," The Commission specifically held: Since these deductions represented timing differences between book and tax accounting, the refunds represented a deferral of 
income taxes and were credited to accumulated deferred income taxes.  In its evidentiary presentation, Com Ed proposed 
adjustments to the test year to reflect changes in deductions for 1974 and to reflect changes in deferred taxes for 1974 and prior 
years.  Since these changes adjusted the actual test year data to reflect the company intended tax deductions, it cannot be 
argued that the Law Judge acted inconsistently in disallowing post test year wage adjustments while accepting adjustments to 
correct current year tax accounts. R. 4982.  It is clear also that the ALJ treated this case as one where evidence was submitted to prove that normalization was 
appropriate.  See R. at 4648-51. "
436,32," Although the Staff conceded that Com Ed satisfied Order No. 530-B, it recommended against normalization because the 
adjustment due under the normalization policy was offset elsewhere.  See R. at 4649 (""the higher allowance for Account No. 282 
deferred taxes as calculated by Staff more than offsets the adjustments in issue."")."

436,34," See P. GARFIELD AND W. LOVEJOY, PUBLIC UTILITY ECONOMICS 56-83 (1964) (hereinafter GARFIELD AND 
LOVEJOY).  So as not to confuse, we should note that the rate base is, very simply, ""the net (or depreciated) valuation of the 
public utility's tangible property, comprising the plant and equipment used and useful in serving the public.  (Such tangible 
property is called 'plant in service' in the uniform systems of accounts prescribed for public utilities.) In addition, the rate base 
includes an allowance for working capital and, depending on the circumstances, may also include amounts for the overhead 
costs of organizing the business, intangibles, and going-concern value."" Id. at 56."
436,35," As will be seen more fully infra, the energy charge has two parts: (1) the basic energy rate; and (2) the fuel adjustment clause.  
The basic energy rate is a base cost or an estimate of what fuel will cost during a specific period.  The fuel adjustment charge 
represents the difference between base and actual costs.  See generally Anaheim at 14-15."
436,36," Cost of service is not to be confused with the billing of service, which is considered infra.  See generally Re Virginia Electric & 
Power Co., 9 P.U.R. 3d 225, 239 (1953): ""Cost is only one of the many elements to be considered in determining the

California, the Commission used a 12-CP method where average monthly peaks to the annual peak was 87.8% and the ratio of 
the lowest monthly peak to the annual peak was 79.1%.  In Louisiana Power, the Commission used a 4-CP method where 
average monthly peaks to the annual peak was 62% and the ratio of lowest monthly peak to the annual peak was 56%."
437,40," R. 4658.  In addition the ALJ found: Com Ed has 25 high voltage interconnections which materially reduce the amount of peak period reserve capacity by 
approximately two-thirds of what would be necessary without such connections (Tr. 450). These interconnection arrangements 
with other utilities require Com Ed to pay carrying charges throughout the year (Tr. 449) and these charges are assessed 
against all customers on an annual basis. Com Ed purchases capacity from Commonwealth Edison Company of Indiana, a subsidiary, and from the Ludington Pumped 
Storage facility (Ex. C1B, p. 1).  Although Com Ed claims that these purchases are made solely to add capacity for the summer 
peak, it conceded that since the carrying costs were fixed ""the Company uses energy from [this] capacity… whenever it is good 
system operation to do so."" (Ex. C1B, p. 2).  Com Ed also has an agreement with Indiana and Michigan Power for purchase of 
500 mw during the summer months, and a 200 mw diversity interchange in which Com Ed has arranged to relieve itself of 
excess capacity during the winter months, in exchange for power during the summer months. "
438,," Com Ed projects its peak loads on a month-by-month basis in order to assure that there will be sufficient capacity for load and 
maintenance on a year-round basis (Ex. C4, Tr. 456).  It schedules its maintenance during non-peak months in order to have 
generating units available during the peak months.  Com Ed's power planning engineer testified on cross-examination that Com 
Ed's 3% ""net reserve"" (reserve less interchanges, maintenance, and forced outages) on the peak day in 1974 remains in 
generally the same range throughout the 12 monthly peaks (Tr. 465-466). Com Ed submitted a projection of its electric power reserves for the period of 1976-1985.This projection shows that the reserve 
power margin and surplus is expected to be substantially lower in July and August than in the other months (Ex. C1.3-C1.12).  
This forecast of future years conflicts with Com Ed's actual experience in 1974 in which the surplus of available power in relation 
to power used remained in generally the same range on a year-round basis.  R. 4658-60.  See n.37 supra."
438,41, See n.40 supra. 
439,42," There is a dispute between the parties as to whether this is a ""true ratchet."" Ordinarily, a ratchet simply sets a floor under 
maximum demand for billing purposes.  GARFIELD AND LOVEJOY at 157.  When set at 100%, it sets both the floor and the 
ceiling, i.e., it sets the demand cost.  The debate has no substantive consequence and, although we adopt the term ""ratchet"" for 
present purposes, we do not presume to settle this semantic dispute for all time."
439,43," The billing demand provision reads: The billing demand (except for partial requirements customers) shall be the highest maximum demand established in any one of 
the four preceding summer months, including the billing month if it is a summer month. R. 3278."
439,44," Cities maintain that the purpose behind the ratchet will be unfulfilled.  The ratchet, Cities argue, will not invite conservation but 
waste: ""The ratchet imposes on the wholesale customer a fixed demand charge no matter what the customer's actual usage is."" 
Initial Brief of Cities at 48.  But as Com Ed notes, the ratchet is not designed solely to promote individual ""conservation."" Rather, 
the purpose of the ratchet is also to promote system efficiency, i.e., to eliminate off-peak excess capacity or at least to charge 
those responsible for it. Brief for Com Ed in No. 80-1072 at 42.Cities' response that they will be unable to effect consumption 
patterns by their customers is beside the point.  See Reply Brief for Cities at 19."
439,45," The disproportional seasonal demand of individual customers would not cause problems if that disproportional use were 
spread evenly throughout the year.  In such a case, the system would, in fact, experience no periodic excess capacity.  
However, when disproportional impact is seasonal, as here, efficiency can be encouraged by billing those customers responsible 
for the seasonal variation. "
440,46," R. 2255 (""The load of the municipalities coincident with the Edison system peak was 47% higher in 1973 than in 1970, while 
the Edison peak itself grew only 24.3% over that period."")"
440,47," At oral argument, Com Ed suggested for the first time that the 75%-23 month ratchet did not affect a single bill because the 
100% ratchet was controlling.  If that is the case, it is unclear to us why both ratchets were sought in the first place and how if 
both had been allowed they would have operated together. "
441,48," The plain language of the statute, 16 U.S.C.  § 824d(e) (The Commission ""may … require such public utility or public utilities to 
refund such portions of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified"") (emphasis added), and a 
recent decision of this court, Belco v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 589 F.2d 680 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 
U.S. 934 (Commission discretion to order and compute refund), also dictate affirmance of the Commission's decision."
441,49, The Staff recommended a 12% rate of return.
441,50," Hjelmfelt, A Price Squeeze Theory For Implementation of Federal Power Commission v. Conway, 50 U. COLO. L. REV. 459

wholesale customers that they cannot compete with the suppliers' retail rates."" See also M. PECK, COMPETITION IN THE

] 18 C.F.R.  § 2.17(e) provides: The burden of proof (i.e. the risk of nonpersuasion) to rebut the allegations of price squeeze and to justify the proposed rates are 
on the utility proposing the rates under section 205(e) of the Federal Power Act. See also Opinion No. 62, Southern California Edison Co., FERC Docket No. ER 76-205 (August 22, 1979), slip op. at 23-24, 
aff'd sub nom. Anaheim (price squeeze issue not resolved on appeal): HN14[
] [I]t is clear that a judgment that a price squeeze exists follows a three-part analysis.  First, we must determine whether 
there is price discrimination. Second, we must determine whether the price discrimination has had any anticompetitive effects.  If 
the answer to both of these inquiries is yes, a price squeeze is said to exist and a presumption arises that the rates are unduly 
discriminatory.  We would then determine whether there were any countervailing public policy or factual circumstances which 
merit a finding that the discrimination is not undue.  Absent such a finding, the determination of a proper remedy would be 
required. (Footnotes  [*87]  omitted.) "
445,52," Further, neither Conway nor Batavia require the Commission to set a wholesale rate so that wholesale customers are 
guaranteed the ability to compete in the retail market.  It may be, for instance, that the state commission is not allowing an 
adequate rate of return. If so, the Commission is not obliged to follow, and indeed may not follow suit, for the rates it sets must 
fall within the range of reasonableness. See Bethany, slip op. as modified on rehearing at 20-21."
445,53," See R. 4339 (Order Reopening Record); R. 5008 (Opinion No. 63).  All parties to this proceeding, including Cities, agree with 
this market definition.  See Cities Brief, April 27, 1981, at 21-22, 24.  See also R. 5278 (Opinion No. 63-A) (setting out Cities' 
argument, step one of which was ""there is across-the-board competition between Com Ed and Cities, comprehending franchise 
competition and competition for every retail class and subclass…""). "
446,54," The Commission should also be careful to insure that wholesale costs are not artificially high because of utility inefficiency 
(intended or unintended) in the wholesale market.  Inefficiency in the wholesale market accompanied by efficiency in the retail 
market could naturally work to the disadvantage of wholesale customer/retail competitors. "
455,1," The two rates were ""substantially"" identical from 1955 to 1968.  The 1968 settlement was entered into after an informal 
complaint filed with the Commission by the cities of Batavia and Geneva in 1966.  The 1966 complaint contended that there was 
no valid basis for the small differential between Rates 6 and 78. Docket IN-989, IN-991."
455,2," The Federal Power Act empowers the Commission to regulate ""the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate 
commerce,"" 16 U.S.C. § 824. Retail sales are regulated by state commissions."
455,3," A fuel adjustment clause is a device that allows utilities to pass on the increasing cost of fuel to customers without filing a new 
rate schedule.  See n.21 infra. "
456,4, A definition of rate schedule is set out at n.25 infra.

456,8," The Staff used a 12-CP method of demand allocation, rather than the 1-CP method used in the Company's study. "
457,36," The parties, both in hearings and in their briefs, have addressed certain of the concerns voiced by the Court in Cities of 
Batavia regarding the reasonableness of a retail class which blankets all industrials regardless of their individual peak 
characteristics.  The court's concern appears to be that group subsidies within the industrial class may work to the disadvantage 
of the wholesale class.  This is a proper concern.  It would be a matter to be remedied if that part of the industrial class for which 
the wholesale customer wished to compete were being subsidized by higher rates to that part of the industrial class for which the 
wholesale customer did not wish to compete. There is no evidence that this situation prevails in this case. "
458,9," R. 5361-5400.  Specifically Cities contend that Com Ed's cost of service study was invalid because (1) it used retail revenues 
for subsequent periods beyond the test period to obtain a return on equity comparable to that earned by resale revenues in the 
actual 1974 test year, and (2) it was based upon estimated coincident demand data for Com Ed's 225,000 retail customers. See 
pp.  --  -  --  infra."
458,10," The Commission rejected Cities' objection to the use of post-test retail rates and to the use of estimated wholesale and retail 
coincident peak demands: The load estimates which underlie the compliance filing were based on sampling and class load estimating methodologies 
routinely used by the Com Ed for its own purposes and in class cost of service studies for retail rate proceedings before the 
Illinois Commission. Com Ed's method of developing the estimates of retail coincident demand appears to be reasonable 
considering the data available. R. 5418. "
459,11," The Commission stated: We had before us the compliance filing, Cities' objections to the compliance filing, Com Ed's response to the objections along 
with testimony and affidavits of its witnesses.  Since the issue raised by the Cities would rise or fall on the validity of their 
statistical method, a hearing was not necessary to resolve such issues upon a finding that their statistical method was invalid. R. 5490."
459,12," The Commission's jurisdictional challenge does not extend to our authority to determine whether there is an unjustified or 
illegal price squeeze. Final agency action on the price squeeze issue was not taken until February 2, 1981, R. 5489, and a 
petition for review of that action was timely filed with this court on March 6, 1981.  The Commission did not conclude the price 
squeeze issue with Opinions Nos. 63 and 63-A because it determined that additional information on that issue was required.  R. 
5019-20.  Only after the Commission accepted Com Ed's compliance filing, R. 5416, and determined that there was no 
anticompetitive price discrimination, could Cities appeal the Commission's final disposition of that issue.  When Cities appealed 
the final agency action on the price squeeze issue, we consolidated that appeal with their January 16th appeal from Opinion No. 
63-A, which raised price squeeze as well as non-price squeeze issues."
459,13," In response to that petition, the Commission also argued that the price squeeze and tax normalization issues were not yet 
ripe for review.  FERC Brief, September 11, 1980, at 20-25."
459,14," Cities have cast substantial doubt upon the issue date of Opinion No. 63-A.  According to the records of Cities' counsel, 
Opinion No. 63-A was not delivered across town to Cities' counsel until November 30, 1979, two weeks after the Commission 
contends the Opinion issued.  See Affidavit of Carol Vodra, Cities Supp'l Brief, October 15, 1980, Appendix B.  See also Id. 
Appendix C.  While Cities do not dispute that the Opinion was placed in inter-office mail on November 16, they question whether 
it was given to the United States Postal Service on that day.  See Affidavits of Louis D. Cashell and Ray A. Huber, FERC Supp'l 
Brief, Appendices A and B; Cities Supp'l Brief, October 15, 1980 at 2-3.  The Cashell Affidavit states that ""(e)ach time an opinion 
is mailed out, the words ""service-issued' are stamped on the card and the date of mailing and opinion number are written in."" 
The affidavit goes on to state that ""(t)he ""service cards' … indicate that one copy of Opinion No. 63-A was mailed … on 
November 16, 1979."" The affidavit does not explain whether ""mailed"" means placed in the United States mail or simply placed in 
inter-office mail.  It does not dispose of the real possibility that the Opinion may not have been deposited in the United States 
Mail until, at best, the day after it was placed in inter-office mail.  Cf.  18 C.F.R. § 1.17(d) (""The date of service shall be the day 
when the matter served is deposited in the United States mail …"").  Thus, on the basis of the record before us, we would be 
unable to determine whether Opinion No. 63-A did, in fact, issue on November 16.  For the reasons below, we need not resolve 
that problem.  We should note, however, that if we were confronted with that problem-i.e., if we had to decide whether the 
Opinion issued on November 16 for jurisdictional reasons-we might not dismiss issues so important to the price squeeze issue 
(which the Commission concedes is now legitimately raised) as well as to whether the wholesale rate was ""just and reasonable"" 
but for the price squeeze, unless the Commission, as movant, was able to resolve our doubts about the issue date of Opinion 
No. 63-A."
459,15," While a petition from an agency order cannot be filed after the statutory period for filing has run, it may be that some of the 
issues that might have been raised in that appeal are so inextricably linked to a subsequent agency opinion on another aspect of 
the same case, that those issues may be raised in a timely appeal from the second opinion.  For example, the demand allocation 
issue in this case is an important element not only of Opinion No. 63-A, but also of the agency's price squeeze decision.  
Therefore, even if Cities' appeal from Opinion No. 63-A were not timely filed, Cities might still have been able to raise the 
demand allocation issue in their timely appeal from the agency's final action on the price squeeze issue. "
460,16," Section 313(b) reads in relevant part: Any party to a proceeding under this Act aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a 
review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit wherein the licensee or public utility to which the order 
relates is located or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by 
filing in such court, within sixty days after the order of the Commission upon the application for rehearing, a written petition 
praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part."

day of issuance of an order shall be the day the Office of the Secretary mails or delivers copies of the order (full text) to the 
parties or their attorneys of record, or makes such copies public, whichever be the earlier.  Orders will not be made public prior 
to the mailing or delivery to the parties or their attorneys of record, except where, in the judgment of the Commission, the public 
interest so requires.  The day of issuance of an order may not be the day of its adoption by the Commission.  In any event, the 
Office of the Secretary shall clearly indicate on each order the date of its issuance.  At the time any intermediate initial or 
tentative decision becomes effective as a decision of the Commission in the absence of Commission review as provided for by 
§§ 1.30 and 1.31, the Secretary will issue and serve upon the parties of record an appropriate notice of the date such decision 
became effective as a Commission decision or order."
460,19," The ALJ's decision against Cities was upheld but on different grounds.  The ALJ understood Cities' argument to be based 
upon alleged imprudent judgment by Com Ed's management in developing excessive reserve capacity.  R. 4646.  The 
Commission recognized that Cities' position went further and would deny Com Ed recovery of even certain prudently incurred 
capital carrying charges.  R. 4971. "
461,20," R. 4975.  Cities' use of the term ""normalization"" instead of ""adjustment"" caused the Commission to respond to an argument, 
not presented by Cities although perhaps supportable, that the rate base ought to have been normalized to reallocate the cost of 
excess capacity to those who will actually benefit from it.  Normalization is an accounting device by which expenses are 
distributed over a period of time in a different manner from that by which they are incurred.  Cf. pp. 77-80 infra (tax 
normalization).  As the Commission recognized, it is arguable that customers taking power at the beginning of a cycle are paying 
for capacity costs incurred for the benefit of customers at the end of the cycle and therefore an interperiod reallocation is 
appropriate.  This is because: In order to achieve economies of scale, utilities characteristically add capacity in large lumps.  As a result, when a new facility 
first goes on line, the utility may well have a significant amount of spare capacity.  This spare capacity is gradually consumed by 
load growth, so that at the end of the cycle the utility is maintaining the bare minimum reserves. R. 4973.  The Commission did not pursue the theory because it was neither suggested by Cities nor sustained by the record.  To 
sustain such a theory, the Commission noted that: The analysis and calculation would not be simple, however. Among the factors that might have to be taken into account are the 
following: the possibility of irregular growth in demand; a discrepancy between the length of the described expansion cycle and 
the period between rate applications; fuel expense savings accruing to the benefit of customers in the early years of the 
expansion cycle due to the ""premature"" addition of presumably efficient new capacity; the fact that capital carrying charges per 
unit of capacity do not stay constant due to depreciation; and some recognition of the fact that customers in the early years 
receive some of the benefits of the economies of scale that were a basis for the decision to add capacity in a large lump. R. 4974 n.7. "
462,21," As we explained recently in Anaheim, et al. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 216 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 669 F.2d 799,

462,23," Section 205, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(e) provides: Whenever any such new schedule is filed the Commission shall have authority … to enter upon a hearing concerning the 
lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service; and, pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the Commission 
… may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a 
longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearings, either completed 
before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the Commission may make such orders with reference 
thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after it had become effective.  If the proceeding has not been concluded and 
an order made at the expiration of such five months, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into 
effect at the end of such period, but in case of a proposed increase rate or charge, the Commission may by order require the 
interested public utility or public utilities to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, 
specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by 
further order require such public utility or public utilities to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts 
were paid, such portion of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified…. "
463,24," Section 206, 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a) provides: Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or 
classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contact affecting such rate, charge, or classification is 
unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, 
charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by 
order."

the cost of fuel shall be determined in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the Illinois Commerce

that Com Ed's presently effective provision reflects total system losses rather than wholesale losses.  These two issues which "
464,," bear on the justness and reasonableness of Com Ed's fuel adjustment provision require this Commission to institute an 
investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power."").  We do not mean, however, to prejudge this case."

(1970). "
465,29," On May 6, 1981, the Commission issued Order No. 144 holding tax normalization of miscellaneous timing differences in 
electric ratemaking appropriate.  That order has been stayed pending reconsideration. "
466,30," Evidence was not submitted until December 23, 1975, R. 2370-76, which was after Order No. 530 but before Orders Nos. 
503-A, 530-B and the Order Denying Rehearing of Order No. 530-B (which announced that the general policy allowing 
normalization would be prospective)."
466,31," The Commission specifically held: Since these deductions represented timing differences between book and tax accounting, the refunds represented a deferral of 
income taxes and were credited to accumulated deferred income taxes.  In its evidentiary presentation, Com Ed proposed 
adjustments to the test year to reflect changes in deductions for 1974 and to reflect changes in deferred taxes for 1974 and prior 
years.  Since these changes adjusted the actual test year data to reflect the company intended tax deductions, it cannot be 
argued that the Law Judge acted inconsistently in disallowing post test year wage adjustments while accepting adjustments to 
correct current year tax accounts. R. 4982.  It is clear also that the ALJ treated this case as one where evidence was submitted to prove that normalization was 
appropriate.  See R. at 4648-51."
466,32," Although the Staff conceded that Com Ed satisfied Order No. 530-B, it recommended against normalization because the 
adjustment due under the normalization policy was offset elsewhere.  See R. at 4649 (""the higher allowance for Account No. 282 
deferred taxes as calculated by Staff more than offsets the adjustments in issue"")."
466,33," See n.29 supra; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Docket No. RM-80-42 (March 21, 1980). "
467,34," See P. Garfield and W. Lovejoy, Public Utility Economics 56-83 (1964) (hereinafter Garfield and Lovejoy).  So as not to 
confuse, we should note that the rate base is, very simply, ""the net (or depreciated) valuation of the public utility's tangible 
property, comprising the plant and equipment used and useful in serving the public.  (Such tangible property is called ""plant in 
service' in the uniform systems of accounts prescribed for public utilities.) In addition, the rate base includes an allowance for 
working capital and, depending on the circumstances, may also include amounts for the overhead costs of organizing the 
business, intangibles, and going-concern value."" Id. at 56."
467,35," As will be seen more fully infra, the energy charge has two parts: (1) the basic energy rate; and (2) the fuel adjustment clause.  
The basic energy rate is a base cost or an estimate of what fuel will cost during a specific period.  The fuel adjustment charge 
represents the difference between base and actual costs.  See generally Anaheim at 14-15."
467,36," Cost of service is not to be confused with the billing of service, which is considered infra.  See generally Re Virginia Electric & 
Power Co., 9 P.U.R.3d 225, 239 (1953): ""Cost is only one of the many elements to be considered in determining the 
appropriateness of particular rates.  The value of service is a matter of great importance in the establishment of individual rates."""

12,270 mw; August, 11,518 mw; September, 10,714 mw.  The average of summer month peaks constituted 92.2% of the annual 
system peak. Use during the eight off-peak monthly peaks of the test year amounted to 78% of the power used during the four 
summer month peak period.  R. 4658."

at 18; Opinion No. 813, Louisiana Power Light Co., Docket No. E-8615 (July 21, 1977), slip op. at 18, 20.  In Southern California, 
the Commission used a 12-CP method where average monthly peaks to the annual peak was 87.8% and the ratio of the lowest 
monthly peak to the annual peak was 79.1%.  In Louisiana Power, the Commission used a 4-CP method where average monthly 
peaks to the annual peak was 62% and the ratio of lowest monthly peak to the annual peak was 56%."
468,40," R. 4658. In addition the ALJ found: Com Ed has 25 high voltage interconnections which materially reduce the amount of peak period reserve capacity by 
approximately two-thirds of what would be necessary without such connections (Tr. 450).  These interconnection arrangements 
with other utilities require Com Ed to pay carrying charges throughout the year (Tr. 449) and these charges are assessed 
against all customers on an annual basis. Com Ed purchases capacity from Commonwealth Edison Company of Indiana, a subsidiary, and from the Ludington Pumped 
Storage facility (Ex. C1B, p. 1).  Although Com Ed claims that these purchases are made solely to add capacity for the summer 
peak, it conceded that since the carrying costs were fixed ""the Company uses energy from (this) capacity … whenever it is good 
system operation to do so."" (Ex. C1B, p. 2).  Com Ed also has an agreement with Indiana and Michigan Power for purchase of 
500 mw during the summer months, and a 200 mw diversity interchange in which Com Ed has arranged to relieve itself of 
excess capacity during the winter months, in exchange for power during the summer months. Com Ed projects its peak loads on a month-by-month basis in order to assure that there will be sufficient capacity for load and 
maintenance on a year-round basis (Ex. C4, Tr. 456).  It schedules its maintenance during non-peak months in order to have 
generating units available during the peak months.  Com Ed's power planning engineer testified on cross-examination that Com 
Ed's 3% ""net reserve"" (reserve less interchanges, maintenance, and forced outages) on the peak day in 1974 remains in 
generally the same range throughout the 12 monthly peaks (Tr. 465-466). Com Ed submitted a projection of its electric power reserves for the period of 1976-1985.  This projection shows that the reserve 
power margin and surplus is expected to be substantially lower in July and August than in the other months (Ex. C1.3-C1.12).  
This forecast of future years conflicts with Com Ed's actual experience in 1974 in which the surplus of available power in relation 
to power used remained in generally the same range on a year-round basis. R. 4658-60.  See n.37 supra."
468,41, See n.40 supra. 
469,42," There is a dispute between the parties as to whether this is a ""true ratchet."" Ordinarily, a ratchet simply sets a floor under 
maximum demand for billing purposes.  Garfield and Lovejoy at 157. When set at 100%, it sets both the floor and the ceiling, i.e., 
it sets the demand cost.  The debate has no substantive consequence and, although we adopt the term ""ratchet"" for present 
purposes, we do not presume to settle this semantic dispute for all time."
469,43," The billing demand provision reads: The billing demand (except for partial requirements customers) shall be the highest maximum demand established in any one of 
the four preceding summer months, including the billing month if it is a summer month. R. 3278. "
470,44," Cities maintain that the purpose behind the ratchet will be unfulfilled.  The ratchet, Cities argue, will not invite conservation but 
waste: ""The ratchet imposes on the wholesale customer a fixed demand charge no matter what the customer's actual usage is."" 
Initial Brief of Cities at 48.  But as Com Ed notes, the ratchet is not designed solely to promote individual ""conservation."" Rather, 
the purpose of the ratchet is also to promote system efficiency, i.e., to eliminate off-peak excess capacity or at least to charge 
those responsible for it.  Brief of Com Ed in No. 80-1072 at 42.  Cities' response that they will be unable to affect consumption 
patterns by their customers is beside the point.  See Reply Brief for Cities at 19."
470,45," The disproportional seasonal demand of individual customers would not cause problems if that disproportional use were 
spread evenly throughout the year.  In such a case, the system would, in fact, experience no periodic excess capacity.  
However, when disproportional impact is seasonal, as here, efficiency can be encouraged by billing those customers responsible 
for the seasonal variation."
470,46," R. 2255 (""The load of the municipalities coincident with the Edison system peak was 47% higher in 1973 than in 1970, while 
the Edison peak itself grew only 24.3% over that period.""). "
471,47," At oral argument, Com Ed suggested for the first time that the 75%-23 month ratchet did not affect a single bill because the 
100% ratchet was controlling.  If that is the case, it is unclear to us why both ratchets were sought in the first place and how if 
both had been allowed they would have operated together."
471,48," The plain language of the statute, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(e) (The Commission ""may … require such public utility or public utilities to 
refund such portions of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified"") (emphasis added), and a 
recent decision of this court, Belco v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 191 U.S. App. D.C. 157, 589 F.2d 680 
(D.C.Cir.1978), (Commission discretion to order and compute refund), also dictate affirmance of the Commission's decision."
471,49, The Staff recommended a 12% rate of return. 
472,50," Hjelmfelt, A Price Squeeze Theory For Implementation of Federal Power Commission v. Conway, 50 U.Colo.L.Rev. 459 
(1979), notes that ""HN13[

rates to its wholesale customers that they cannot compete with the suppliers' retail rates."" See also M. Peck, Competition In The

on the utility proposing the rates under section 205(e) of the Federal Power Act. See also Opinion No. 62, Southern California Edison Co., FERC Docket No. ER 76-205 (August 22, 1979), slip op. at 23-24, 
aff'd sub nom. Anaheim (price squeeze issue not resolved on appeal): "
473,," It is clear that a judgment that a price squeeze exists follows a three-part analysis.  First, we must determine whether there is 
price discrimination. Second, we must determine whether the price discrimination has had any anticompetitive effects.  If the 
answer to both of these inquiries is yes, a price squeeze is said to exist and a presumption arises that the rates are unduly 
discriminatory.  We would then determine whether there were any countervailing public policy or factual circumstances which 
merit a finding that the discrimination is not undue.  Absent such a finding, the determination of a proper remedy would be 
required. (Footnotes omitted.) "
476,52," Further, neither Conway nor Batavia require the Commission to set a wholesale rate so that wholesale customers are 
guaranteed the ability to compete in the retail market.  It may be, for instance, that the state commission is not allowing an 
adequate rate of return. If so, the Commission is not obliged to follow, and indeed may not follow suit, for the rates it sets must 
fall within the range of reasonableness. See Bethany, as modified on rehearing at 200."
476,53," See R. 4339 (Order Reopening Record); R. 5008 (Opinion No. 63).  All parties to this proceeding, including Cities, agree with 
this market definition.  See Cities Brief, April 27, 1981, at 21-22, 24. See also R. 5278 (Opinion No. 63-A) setting out Cities' 
argument, step one of which was ""there is across-the-board competition between Com Ed and Cities, comprehending franchise 
competition and competition for every retail class and subclass …"")."
476,54," The Commission should also be careful to insure that wholesale costs are not artificially high because of utility inefficiency 
(intended or unintended) in the wholesale market.  Inefficiency in the wholesale market accompanied by efficiency in the retail 
market could naturally work to the disadvantage of wholesale customer/retail competitors. "
479,1, .  The plaintiff and defendant in the original action are also the plaintiff and defendant in this action.
479,2," .  The complaint originally contained two additional counts involving alleged infringement of the patent by Sears.  Those counts, 
eventually dropped in the first action, are one of the subjects of the present lawsuit. The parties have filed cross motions for 
summary judgment on the patent infringement issue.  Those motions are dealt with in a separate order. "
481,3," .  As can be readily seen, the complaint's antitrust allegations are somewhat vague, and plaintiff does not attempt to make 
distinctions among the statutory sections under which liability is asserted.  Because the court's treatment of the antitrust count is 
applicable to both the Sherman Act claims and the Clayton Act claim, it will follow plaintiff's lead and refer to the antitrust claims 
as a group."
481,4," .  A showing of such direct antitrust injury must be made even in the context of a case alleging fraud on the patent office. For 
example, in Walker Process, both plaintiff and defendant were involved in the manufacture of equipment used in sewage 
treatment systems.  In Kearney & Trecker, the parties manufactured machine tools.  Thus, in both cases, the plaintiff could 
successfully ""allege that the antitrust violation injured a commercial enterprise of the plaintiff in the area of the economy in which 
the elimination of competition occurred."" In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, M.D.L.No.31, 481 F.2d 122, 128 (9th Cir. 1973). "
482,5," .  Roberts now attempts, in what can only fairly be construed as a self-serving affidavit, to retract his earlier deposition testimony 
and speculate that he would have ""considered"" selling wrenches had he retained the patent instead of assigning it to Sears.  
Affidavit of Peter M. Roberts at 2.  This evidence is clearly inadequate to create an issue of fact which would prevent this court 
from entering summary judgment in favor of defendant with regard to the time period presently under discussion.  HN2[
] F.R.Civ.P. 56(e) restricts affidavits properly considered in summary judgment proceedings to those which contain testimony 
which would be admissible at trial.  Roberts' current conjecture as to what he might have thought about doing at an early time is 
simply too speculative to be characterized as admissible.  Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. v. Lorain Journal Co., 298 F.2d 356, 
360 (6th Cir. 1961); Bridgen v. Scott, 456 F. Supp. 1048, 1064 (S.D.Tex.1978). It is interesting to note that Roberts' unsuccessful attempt to now assert that he was a potential competitor in the marketing and 
selling of quick release wrenches actually points out the error of another of his arguments, namely that if he is not allowed to 
sue, no other possible plaintiff will exist to challenge Sears' alleged monopoly.  Plaintiff's Brief at 20.  Certainly, if in fact Sears 
did violate the antitrust laws, there are individuals capable of making a more legitimate showing that they had both the economic 
capability and actual intent to enter the relevant market.  Cf. III Areeda and Turner, Antitrust Law P 701c, see also P. Areeda, 
Antitrust Analysis, P 160(c) and cases cited therein (1974). "
483,6," .  It is undoubtedly plaintiff's reliance on Moraine which has given rise to his most puzzling argument-namely that if he were the 
holder of the patent, he would have freely licensed any interested party who wished to enter into a licensing agreement. 
Plaintiff's affidavit at 2-3.  Because of 1) the speculative nature of these statements, see fn. 5, p. 788, supra, and 2) their 
irrelevance given the fact that plaintiff was not the owner of the patent during this time period, see Roberts II, 617 F.2d at 465, 
this court declines to analyze further plaintiff's conjecture as to his benevolence. "
488,1," .  Defendant Food Concepts Corp. acquired Freshway Food Systems, Inc. in May, 1978.  Food Concepts thereafter assumed 
Freshway's contractual obligations.  Some of these contracts contain either the restrictive covenant in question, or one similar 
thereto."

504,23," ""What is called for is an appraisal of the ""cross-elasticity' of demand in the trade."" Id. at 394, 76 S. Ct. at 1006. The court 
examined the cross-elasticity of demand between cellophane and other flexible wrappings as follows: An element for consideration as to cross-elasticity of demand between products is the responsiveness of the sales of one 
product to price changes of the other.  If a slight decrease in the price of cellophane causes a considerable number of customers 
of other flexible wrappings to switch to cellophane it would be an indication that a high cross-elasticity of demand exists between 
them; that the products compete in the same market.  The court below held that the ""(g)reat sensitivity of customers in the 
flexible packaging markets to price or quality changes"" prevented du Pont from possessing monopoly control over price.  (U. S. 
v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours & Co.) 118 F. Supp., at 207. The record sustains these findings. (Footnotes omitted.) Id. at 400, 76 
S. Ct. at 1009."
504,24," ""The Government stresses the fact that the variation in price between cellophane and other materials demonstrates they are 
noncompetitive.  As these products are all flexible wrapping materials, it seems reasonable to consider, as was done at the trial, 
their comparative cost to the consumer in terms of square area."" Id. at 400-01, 76 S. Ct. at 1009-1010. Cellophane was found to cost two or three times as much as its chief competitor for the flexible wrapping market, but to cost less 
than several other forms of flexible wrapping.  The Court found those differences in cost did not give DuPont monopoly power 
over prices."
504,25," See Findings 32 and 33, 92 F.T.C. at 668-9. "
505,26," Borden's claim of direct evidence contradicting the Commission's findings is insufficient.  Borden points to testimony from only 
two witnesses to support its argument of price responsiveness between fresh lemons and processed lemon juice. One sales 
manager for a regional distributor stated that he ""would be hazarding a guess"" that a correlation existed between the lower price 
of fresh lemons and a decline in sales of his company's product during the same time period.  The other witness, the president of 
a regional distributor, stated that a very high price for lemons will affect the movement of lemon juice in that ""a housewife will 
have the option to buy lemon juice other than fresh lemons."" He also testified, however, that no correlation existed between retail 
fresh lemon prices and retail processed lemon juice prices."
505,27," See Finding 28, 92 F.T.C. at 683."
505,28," In Cellophane, the court stated that the competitive market for commodities depends on how different they are from one 
another in character or use, and ""how far buyers will go to substitute one commodity for another."" 351 U.S. at 393, 76 S. Ct. at 
1006. It further noted that ""it is the variable characteristics of the different flexible wrappings"" and the producers' marketing ability 
that determine choice.  Id. at 402, 76 S. Ct. at 1011. "
506,29," See Finding 19, 92 F.T.C. at 679, and the many comments from consumers quoted therein."
506,30," The Court in Brown Shoe explained the definition of a submarket as follows: The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.  However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist 
which, in themselves, constitute product markets for anti-trust purposes.  United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 
U.S. 586, 593-595 (77 S. Ct. 872, 877-878, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057). The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by 
examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's 
peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and 
specialized vendors. (Footnotes omitted.) 370 U.S. at 325, 82 S. Ct. at 1523."

506,32," See L. G. Balfour Co. v. F. T. C., 442 F.2d 1, 11 (7th Cir. 1971). Apparently Borden does not seriously contest the finding that 
processed lemon juice is a relevant submarket if the submarket criteria may be applied here, and properly so because 
substantial evidence supports the Commission's finding that processed lemon juice is a submarket. In addition to the previously discussed differences in qualities, uses, and prices, the Commission found that industry members 
recognized the processed lemon juice market as a separate and distinct economic entity.  This recognition was reflected in the "
507,," pricing policies of industry members, their marketing strategies, and the marketing of fresh lemons without regard for the 
availability of processed lemon juice. Furthermore, there are differences in the production of fresh lemons, which are cleaned 
and processed as fresh produce, and processed lemon juice, which goes through a manufacturing and bottling process.  The 
channels of distribution are also different, with fresh lemons sold through produce brokers and wholesalers, while processed 
lemon juice is sold through grocery brokers or salesmen."

509,," Borden now claims that this statistical data is unreliable and inaccurate, a position obviously inconsistent with its previous 
reliance upon this data in formulating its strategy and marketing plans for ReaLemon.  ReaLemon management used the market 
share figures of a recognized and well established independent market research organization.  Borden's data on its market 
share was substantially corroborated by market share figures compiled by complaint counsel from data obtained from firms 
marketing processed lemon juice. See Findings 71-76, 92 F.T.C. at 702-07."
509,34," Although the ReaLemon market share showed some decline from 1969 through 1974, this decline is not necessarily 
inconsistent with a finding of monopoly power. American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 794-95, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 
1132, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946); Greyhound Computer Corp., supra, 559 F.2d at 496 n.18."
509,35," In the 1972 Marketing Plan, the president of ReaLemon Foods stated that from a technical standpoint, ReaLemon had ""no 
apparent advantage over the juice of any of its competitors. Processed lemon juice is processed lemon juice …"" Other 
ReaLemon market plans, actual prices, and market shares support the finding that ReaLemon commanded a premium price for 
a basically fungible product."
509,36," See Findings 96-100, 92 F.T.C. 716-18, quoting testimony from economist Dr. Michael Mann and from the presidents of two 
regional processed lemon juice companies. "
510,37," The Commission found that ReaLemon spent more than $ 5,000,000 on advertising between 1969 and 1974.  ReaLemon's 
1972 Marketing Plan projected its 1971 advertising expenditure at $ 629,100.  In comparison advertising by competing brands in 
that year was almost non-existent."
510,38," For example, ReaLemon's promotion budget for 1973 was $ 2,805,000.  See Finding 71, 92 F.T.C. at 715."
510,39," Interestingly, Borden attacks the credibility of its own marketing plans and internal documents, contending they are 
untrustworthy, mere proposals, and not substantial evidence of Borden's actions.  This argument might be meritorious if the "
511,," portion of the marketing plans taken alone and out of context were relied upon as evidence of Borden's intent.  See Timken 
Roller Bearing Co. v. F. T. C., 299 F.2d 839, 842 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 861, 83 S. Ct. 118, 9 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1962). 
However, other evidence and testimony corroborated the marketing plans and documents, demonstrating that these plans 
guided ReaLemon's conduct in the market.  Nor were the stated intent and objectives of these plans taken out of context.  A 
major theme running throughout them was Borden's intent to use selective price promotions to restrain and discipline vigorous 
price competition.  Finally, the marketing plans cannot be construed as ""puffery"" meant to impress superiors, for the president of 
ReaLemon contributed to the plans and they were used by management to direct company sales."
511,40," These greater promotional allowances were granted in the Northeast despite the fact that evidence indicated ReaLemon's 
manufacturing costs were greater there.  The greater promotional allowances could not be attributed to lower distribution costs."
511,41," The four key districts listed in the plan were New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit."
511,42," See quotes from correspondence and reports of ReaLemon's sales managers in Findings 128-30, 92 F.T.C. 729-32. "
512,43," The sales in Philadelphia were to Acme Markets, the largest supermarket chain in the city with 20% to 28% of the retail 
grocery market.  The sales in Buffalo were to Niagara Frontier Services, owner of the largest volume supermarkets in the area.  
Due to limited shelf space and the large promotions offered these customers by Borden, the Commission found that the short-
term effect was that they were unable to buy from Borden's competitors."

which assesses long-run conditions, for ""such an assessment is required because the essence of predatory pricing is the alleged 
predator's sacrifice of short-run gains for greater long-run gains."" Id. at 217. The first tier would examine the structural 
characteristics of the market and the market power of the alleged predator to determine if they generate a reasonable 
expectation that predatory pricing could occur which would impose significant economic losses on society.  Among the structural 
factors Joskow and Klevorick would consider is the following: Second, we should seek to determine whether the existing dominant firm has been successful in establishing a significant ""brand 
preference"" in the eyes of consumers, not by producing an objectively better product, but by having been first in the market or by 
having made extensive ""image"" advertising expenditures. Faced with such a market, an entrant not only may have to invest the 
resources that are technically required to establish production and distribution networks but also may have to undertake 
substantial promotional expenditures, both to get its product known and to overcome brand loyalties that the dominant firm has 
achieved.  In such situations, successful entry will be more costly and more time-consuming, and, as a result, potential 
competition will be a less effective constraint on the existing dominant firm.  As a result, courts should recognize that because 
generic names and premium brand images induced by advertising change the conditions of entry in such a way that potential "
513,," competition is a less effective constraint on prices than it otherwise might be, dominant firm behavior in such markets may be 
worthy of closer scrutiny. In those cases where the firm and market structural characteristics suggested that efficiency losses are likely to be high if there 
is a failure to identify pricing which is predatory, then the second tier of the analysis would be applied.  Id. at 249. This second 
tier would more closely examine a firm's pricing behavior, and would allow for a more flexible approach in applying the various 
cost-based rules.  The Joskow-Klevorick proposal combines some of the advantages of the per se cost-based rules in that it is a 
workable rule which can be applied by the courts, and some of the advantages of flexibility in the broader Scherer and Posner 
rules.  This article was published after the Commission's opinion was issued."
513,48," The FTC also argues that Borden failed to object to the remedies before the Commission, and raises these objections for the 
first time in this Court.  It appears that the objections in issue were at least indirectly raised before the Commission, and they 
have been considered by this Court."
513,49," This wide latitude is based on the Commission's ""expertise in determining what is necessary to eliminate unfair practices and 
its administrative responsibilities to devise remedies according to a consistent statutory policy."" Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. F. T. 
C., 577 F.2d 653, 662 (9th Cir. 1978). "
514,50," Although the order is sufficiently precise, Borden may still take advantage of the Commission's procedures for advising a 
respondent whether its proposed conduct violates the order.  Concern that hypothetical conduct might violate the order is an 
insufficient reason for modification.  See F. T. C. v. National Lead Co., supra, 352 U.S. at 431, 77 S. Ct. at 510; Luria Brothers & 
Co. v. F. T. C., supra, 389 F.2d 847, 862 (3rd Cir.), cert. den., 393 U.S. 829, 89 S. Ct. 94, 21 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1968)."
514,51," See 92 F.T.C. at 800-01, 804-05."
514,52, 92 F.T.C. at 807 n.41. 
515,1," The Commission heavily relied on its finding that competitors would have to sell at a price well below that of ReaLemon in 
order to compete.  (1976-1979 Transfer Binder)Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) at 21,507-21,508; 21,510.  This finding is a little hard to 
accept, in view of the fact that one of Borden's most successful competitors, Minute Maid, apparently charged significantly more 
for its product than Borden did for ReaLemon. "
516,2," The Commission adopted the analysis of Professor Scherer, who ""find(s) it hard to avoid a value judgment that temporary 
price cutting to eliminate producers handicapped only by an inferior brand image is socially undesirable."" Scherer, ""Predatory 
Pricing and the Sherman Act: A Comment,"" 89 Harv.L.Rev. 869, 889 (1976). (1976-1979 Transfer Binder)Trade Reg. Rep. 
(CCH) at 21,509. This is indeed a value judgment, and it has nothing to do with the ""use of monopoly power"" that section 2 
reaches.  Whether I agree or disagree with Professor Scherer's value judgment, it has no place here.  Despite a rather general 
assumption to the contrary, section 2 of the Sherman Act is not a license for the courts or the FTC to choose among competing 
economic theories of the social good and to impose their own ideas of wise economic policy.  That is the task of Congress, or 
arguably the FTC acting as a rule maker under the FTC Act.  While broad, the definition of monopolization in section 2 is not 
quite that broad."
516,3," The FTC did note that Borden ""apparently"" made some sales of ReaLemon at prices that were below its average total costs, 
after agreeing with the ALJ that Borden did not price ReaLemon below average variable cost.  (1976-1979 Transfer 
Binder)Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) at 21,507. Professors Areeda and Turner would find a monopolist that prices its products above 
average variable cost not guilty of monopolization. Areeda & Turner, ""Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 
of the Sherman Act,"" 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697 (1975). Professor Posner would instead find a violation of the Sherman Act when a 
monopolist sells below average total cost.  Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 188 (1976).  The FTC expressly 
refused to decide whether Posner or Areeda/Turner correctly defined those pricing practices that constitute monopolization. 
(1976-1979 Transfer Binder)Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) at 21,506 n.29. This is understandable since the Commission was 
concerned with manipulation of a price premium, not below cost pricing. Absent a decision by the Commission that pricing below average total cost violates section 2 of the Sherman Act, the fact that 
Borden might have engaged in such pricing has no relevance to this case except, as the Commission used it, to show that 
Borden's prices were low.  This Court cannot take judicial notice that Posner's and not some other economic theory correctly 
defines the use of monopoly power. In fact, the majority expressly refuses to make such a finding.  Thus, the existence of pricing 
below average total cost does not support the majority's decision. The Commission also stated parenthetically that Borden subsidized its price cuts in part with continued monopoly pricing 
elsewhere.  Id. at 21,508. This statement was made as an aside during the Commission's discussion of Borden's manipulation of 
its price premium. The statement would only be true if Posner's definition of predatory pricing were adopted.  Since the 
Commission did not decide that Posner correctly defined pricing that constitutes a use of monopoly power there is no support for "
517,," its statement that Borden used its monopoly profits to subsidize the fight against competition.  The Commission's offhand 
statement cannot be the basis for a finding of monopolization."
517,4," The majority cites with approval Joskow and Klevorick, ""A Framework for Analyzing Predatory Policy,"" 89 Yale L.J. 213 (1979). 
Like Professor Scherer, these commentators would subject the competitive use of an irrational price premium to scrutiny under 
section 2.  Again, like Professor Scherer, their reasons for doing so focus solely on the effect of such a brand preference on 
competition.  As set out below, n.5, I do not believe that it is the function of the FTC to decide which consumer preferences are 
""rational"" and which ""irrational."" However, the fatal flaw I see in Poskow and Klevorick's analysis is that it ignores the complete 
legitimacy of a brand preference created by advertising or by being first in the market.  This is ""business acumen,"" and its use to 
affect competition is not forbidden by section 2 of the Sherman Act."
517,5," The FTC disapproved of the consumer preference for ReaLemon because it resulted from a ""spurious"" product differentiation 
based on the strength of the ReaLemon trademark.  (1976-1979 Transfer Binder)Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) at 21,509-21,510. The 
FTC concluded that there was no rational reason for consumers to pay a premium for the ReaLemon brand name since the 
product is chemically indistinguishable from other brands of reconstituted lemon juice. Id. at 21,508, 21,510. I strongly disagree.  
The primary function of a brand name is to provide consumers an assurance of quality.  It is quite rational for consumers to pay 
extra for ReaLemon to minimize their risk of receiving inferior goods.  Should any proof that this is rational be necessary this 
case provides a prime example.  Borden's principal competitor and the complaining party before the Commission was Golden 
Crown.  The ALJ found and the Commission appears to agree that Golden Crown sold an adulterated product.  Id. at 21,501 
n.16. "
526,1," .  This includes the 394,100 Brunswick shares which Whittaker purchased on the open market prior to the tender offer."
526,2," .  The shareholders holding the 51% or more of the Brunswick stock would be those holders who did not or could not tender to 
Whittaker or whose shares were not accepted for purchase because of proration. "
527,3," .  Whittaker's health care contract with Saudi Arabia was valued at approximately $ 250,000,000.00 in 1977. "
530,4," .  Thus, while the court is addressing both motions for injunctive relief, the denial of an injunction enjoining the Sherwood sale 
which results in Whittaker withdrawing its tender offer in essence will moot Brunswick's claims for injunctive relief regarding the 
Whittaker tender offer."
530,5, .  The Illinois Business Takeover Act allegations are not the subject of the motions for injunctive relief presently before the court. 
531,6," .  Whittaker also requested, on two separate occasions, the entry of a temporary restraining order to restrain Brunswick from 
disposing of Sherwood.  Both motions were denied. "
535,7, .  Such a sale does not necessarily preclude the possible violations of certain state laws.

may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited."
544,15, U.S.C. § 4.
544,3," The Sherman Act provided only for governmental enforcement of the antitrust laws. In 1914, however, Congress enacted the 
Clayton Act to supplement the Sherman Act by sanctioning private antitrust actions.  Clayton Act, ch. 323, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) 
(codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27). Section four of the Clayton Act HN3[

therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."

545,15, U.S.C. § 26.
545,4," Many states and some municipalities opted out of the class action pursuant to Rule 23(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure and brought separate antitrust actions against the NBMA and the participants in the conference call program."
545,5," On plaintiffs' motion, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered the thirty-three private lawsuits consolidated pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. § 1407."
545,6," On December 24, 1975 the district court dismissed for improper venue lawsuits against four defendants that had originally 
been filed in the Northern District of Georgia.  Plaintiffs filed new complaints against the four defendants in the proper judicial 
districts and then invoked the ""tag-along"" transfer provision to consolidate the actions in the Northern District of Georgia.  See 
Rules 1, 9, and 10 of the Rules of Procedure of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation; 28 U.S.C. § 1407(f)."
545,7," At the time of this motion no plaintiffs representing wholesale distributors had filed suit in these proceedings.  The other 
plaintiffs recognized the necessity of including this class, however, and provided for such a class from the outset.  Suit was 
eventually filed on behalf of this class in April 1976, after much of the legal work relating to the NBMA's alleged antitrust 
immunity had been completed, but before any substantial settlement or allocation negotiations had taken place. "
546,8," Admittedly, these other factors besides market data primarily worked to reduce the share of the wholesale distributor class.  As 
the affidavit of the liaison counsel, Emmet J. Bondurant, makes clear, however, this reduction resulted from the belief that 
wholesalers generally passed on their increased costs and that ultimate consumers suffered most of the actual injury stemming 
from the alleged price-fixing.  It should be noted that the wholesale distributor class was represented at the negotiations and 
obviously acceded to this analysis. "
547,9," The settlement negotiations resulted in a fund in excess of $ 30,000,000 that is expected to exceed $ 35,000,000 by the time it 
is distributed.  This contrasts favorably from the plaintiffs' point of view with their own estimates of damages, which ranged from 
$ 23,000,000 to $ 26,000,000."
547,10," On August 13, 1980 the court approved the proposed attorney fees.  The fees totaled less than fifteen percent of the entire

opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and 
that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in 
writing in such order.  The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if 
application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder

HN13[
] Although there may be the potential for a conflict of interest to arise, it is best to avoid second guessing the judgment 
of counsel in settlement negotiations absent an actual conflict of interest which renders effective representation impossible.  Cf.  
United States v. Risi, 603 F.2d 1193, 1195 (5th Cir. 1979) (actual conflict of interest must be demonstrated); Aetna Cas. & Sur.

(objection of conflict of interest overridden because no demonstration of actual conflict)."
549,16," Fifty-nine of the objectors were members of the wholesale distributor class and thus were represented by counsel whose 
efforts were not tainted by the specter of a conflict of interest. The final objector, however, was a member of the supermarket 
class and may properly complain of a conflict of interest. Consequently, we must evaluate this claim in light of the standards 
announced in In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 643 F.2d 195, 207-09 (5th Cir. 1981). In this case, the supermarket 
objector has failed to show any unfair trade-off of its rights or actual prejudice stemming from the allegedly tainted allocation 
negotiations. In addition, this objector has not even suggested that the representative of the supermarket class had any goal but "
550,," to maximize the share of the class and, consequently, the expected legal fees that would result from representation of the class.  
Finally, the large share the class received in this case undermines any argument as to inadequate representation of the 
supermarket class."
550,17," Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: HN18[

directs."

551,20," Objectors specifically attack the allocation arrangement which excused the governmental entities class members from 
submitting claims and proof of damage.  Although admittedly unusual, this arrangement seems to be a fair response to the 
particular difficulties that this class would have in gathering and presenting evidence of damages.  In addition, because of a fear 
that the costs of gathering such proof would exceed the amount received, the state attorneys general insisted upon this feature 
before relinquishing their claims against defendants.  Finally, many states provide for criminal penalties for state antitrust 
violations, thus giving the state attorneys general a unique claim against defendants and added bargaining strength.  See, e.g., 
Ala.Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2, 8-10-3 (1975); Fla.Stat. §§ 542.21-542.27 (1980). "
552,21," Altogether, some 2,404 claims had been filed by the time the allocation agreement was before the district court, 913 of which 
were from members of the wholesale distributor class."
552,22," Objectors contend that as a class they accounted for forty-two percent of all direct broiler purchases.  We note initially that 
this market data derives from 1975 sales figures, a period fully two years after the termination of the conference call program.  It 
is just as easy to use 1969 market figures that demonstrate that wholesale distributors accounted for a market share of slightly 
less than twenty-five percent.  Given the uncertain market figures as well as the evidence of cost-plus pricing and wholly owned 
wholesale subsidiaries, evidence which would reduce the share of the wholesale distributor class, we are unable to agree with 
objectors' contentions that the district court had inadequate economic data to justify the allocation agreement and thus abused 
its discretion in approving the sharing proposal. "

the shipping law exemption for labor agreements: Since the Shipping Act contains its own standards for exempting and for approving and disapproving agreements between 
carriers, and because the ultimate issue in cases such as this is the accommodation of the Shipping Act and the labor laws, 
rather than the labor laws and the antitrust laws, it will not necessarily be a misapplication of the statutes if the exemption for 
collective-bargaining contracts from Shipping Act requirements is not always exactly congruent with the so-called labor

enforce a local monopoly in electrical equipment, and Pennington, supra note 107, in which the UMW and the larger coal mine 
companies reached agreement that the unions would impose high wages and royalties on all companies, allegedly for the 
purpose of eliminating smaller operators from the industry.  The Supreme Court denied antitrust exemptions in both cases.  In "

union-employer conspiracy * * *."" 381 U.S. at 688."
569,111," Boston Shipping, supra note 103, 16 FMC at 12-13. The FMC paraphrased Justice White's discussion in Jewel Tea, supra 
note 107, which determined that the challenged restriction, ""like wages, and unlike prices, is so intimately related to wages, 
hours and working conditions that the unions' successful attempt to obtain that provision through bona fide, arm's-length 
bargaining in pursuit of their own labor union policies * * * falls within the protection of the national labor policy * * *."" 381 U.S. at 
689-690, 85 S. Ct. at 1601-1602. Cf.  Pennington, supra note 107, 381 U.S. at 664-665, 85 S. Ct. at 1590 (legitimate subject of 
union concern, such as wages, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for antitrust law exemption; ""because they must 
bargain does not mean that the agreement reached may disregard other laws"")."
569,112," Boston Shipping, supra note 103, 16 FMC at 13. This criterion distinguishes between separate union-management 
agreements which establish similar wages and working conditions, thereby affecting competition indirectly through their impact 
on costs, prices, and profits, see Jewel Tea, supra note 107, 381 U.S. at 688, 85 S. Ct. at 1601; Pennington, supra note 107,

570,122," Prior to the agreement, nonmember employers had negotiated agreements with the union whose terms were sometimes 
more flexible and more advantageous to the employers than the terms of union-PMA agreements.  Nonmember employers were 
also permitted to enter into separate agreements with PMA to secure their work force through PMA-union hiring halls and to 
participate in the fringe benefit plans administered by PMA.  Id. at 46-47, 98 S. Ct. at 931-932. During the 1970 contract 
negotiations PMA sought to eliminate nonmember participation in the hiring halls and benefit plans in order to encourage 
nonmembers to join PMA.  The parties reached a compromise.  PMA accepted continued nonmember participation on the 
condition that participating nonmembers would be required to agree to pay the same dues and assessments as PMA members, 
follow the same work rules, and ""be treated as a member during work stoppages."" Id. at 47, 98 S. Ct. at 932."

570,124, Respondents' brief at 40-45.
570,125," Id. at 48-58. The Commission recognizes the applicability of the Boston Shipping criteria to the tariff rules in question.  
""While the four specific Boston Shipping criteria were designed to guide the application of a labor exemption to agreements 
under section 15, especially collective bargaining agreements, and therefore their language does not precisely apply to an 
implementing tariff filed unilaterally by a carrier,"" the Commission argued, ""the principles underlying them and the ""final analysis' 
do apply."" Respondents' brief at 48-49.  The Commission further argued that, because the tariff imposed terms on non-parties, 
""PMA controls this case, and properly so * * *."" Id. at 51-52. We agree with the Commission, notwithstanding the dissent's 
assertion of the ""inappositeness of applying that rationale (the PMA test) concerning a collective bargaining agreement to this 
case involving a tariff."" Dissent at 4."
570,126," The general rationale for the § 15 exemption-the need to harmonize two potentially conflicting statutory schemes by 
eliminating overlapping jurisdiction in appropriate cases-would support recognition of a nonstatutory labor exemption from the 
substantive provisions of the shipping laws.  In FMC v. Pacific Maritime Ass'n., supra note 84, the Supreme Court appeared to 
recognize the broad purposes of the labor exemption, although it also found that they did not require a categorical § 15 "
571,," exemption. 435 U.S. at 57-58, 63, 98 S. Ct. at 937, 940 (commending FMC's ""sensitivity to the national labor policy by 
exempting from the filing requirements all collective-bargaining contracts that in its view would also be exempt from the antitrust 
laws"").  If sensitivity to the national labor policy justifies relieving certain labor agreements from the burdens of pre-
implementation filing, it might also support relief from protracted adjudication before the FMC and the courts concerning the 
legality of these agreements.  However, the discussion in the majority opinion does not provide guidance on this issue.  In 
contrast, the dissent assumed that there would be no exemption from the substantive provisions of the shipping laws.  Id. at 68-
69, 77, 98 S. Ct. at 943, 947. This position provides no basis for inferring that the majority of the Court would have denied the 
existence of any exemption from the substantive sections; the majority and the dissent adopted two entirely different criteria for 
delineating the FMC's jurisdiction.  The dissent drew the line between prior restraint of collective bargaining agreements by the 
FMC, which it wished to avoid, and subsequent review, which it was willing to permit in all cases.  The majority, on the other 
hand, permitted prior review in some cases but exempted agreements fulfilling the Boston Shipping guidelines. If the issue were 
raised, the Court might extend the Boston Shipping criteria to the substantive shipping law provisions.  We need not decide the 
question in this case."
571,127," The Rules on Containers appear to satisfy the other three Boston Shipping guidelines. First, the history of labor-management 
confrontation between the steamship companies and the ILA makes clear that the bargaining was at arm's length.  See 
discussion in Part I-A supra.  Second, work preservation is ""intimately related"" to ""a bona fide labor purpose."" See Nat'l 
Woodwork Manufacturers Ass'n. v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 642, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 1266, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967). Third, there is no 
evidence of conspiracy between labor and management; the interests of the two sides are fundamentally different.  See text at 
notes 10-34 supra."

571,131," Although the antitrust cases speak solely of an agreement's effect on competition, the Supreme Court has recognized the 
need to adapt the antitrust labor exemption criteria to the shipping law context.  See note 107 supra.  In antitrust law, imposition 
of terms on the employer's business competitors may deprive a labor-management agreement of an exemption. In the shipping 
context the regulatory scheme protects shipping customers as well as competitors.  An agreement should not be exempt when 
terms are imposed either upon the employer's competitors or upon the employer's shipping customers."
571,132," The tariff sets forth the terms and conditions upon which shippers and consignees may deal with the carrier. See note 96 
supra."
571,133," In both cases the third parties were not compelled to deal with the shipping employers, but failure to do so would have 
adverse economic effects; on the other hand, the standardized terms imposed significant burdens on the third parties. "
572,134, See discussion in Part I-A and Part I-B supra.
572,135," Petitioners maintain that, even if the Rules on Containers have direct effects on shipping interests, these effects are also 
unavoidable and should not disqualify the Rules for an exemption. The Supreme Court, however, has held that the FMC has 
jurisdiction in all cases in which terms are imposed directly upon third parties.  See FMC v. Pacific Maritime Ass'n., supra note 
84.  The necessity of the collective bargaining provisions at issue is a factor the FMC should consider in making its substantive 
determination of legality. See 435 U.S. at 57, 63, 98 S. Ct. at 937, 940; New York Shipping Ass'n. v. FMC, supra note 84, 495 
F.2d at 1222."
572,136," The cases cited by petitioners in support of a contrary proposition, petitioners' brief at 44-45, are inapposite.  The legality of a 
work preservation agreement under the labor laws, id. at 44-46, is a separate issue from its eligibility for exemption from FMC 
shipping law jurisdiction.  See NLRB v. Internat'l Longshoremen's Ass'n., supra note 4, 447 U.S. at 512, 100 S. Ct. at 2318; 
discussion in Part II-A supra. The criteria for a labor exemption from the antitrust laws, also relied upon by petitioners, petitioners' brief at 46-48, are not 
identical to those for a labor exemption from the shipping laws.  See notes 107 & 131 supra.  For example, even though courts 
do not agree on whether imposition of terms outside the bargaining unit is sufficient to defeat an antitrust law exemption, 
respondents' brief at 53-54, FMC v. Pacific Maritime Ass'n., supra note 84, 435 U.S. at 61-63, 98 S. Ct. at 939-940, makes clear 
that imposition of terms on third parties disqualifies an agreement from exemption under the shipping laws.  Therefore, even if 
the Rules are exempt from antitrust scrutiny, as one Court of Appeals has held, see Intercontinental Container Transport Corp. 
v. New York Shipping Ass'n., 426 F.2d 884, 888 (2d Cir. 1970), they might not be exempt from the shipping laws, and vice versa. Finally, Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 83 S. Ct. 239, 9 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1962), cited in petitioners' 
brief at 50-55, a case dealing with Interstate Commerce Commission and National Labor Relations Board jurisdiction over ""hot 
cargo"" agreements, reversed the ICC's choice of remedy.  However, it expressly acknowledged the ICC's authority to enforce 
the common carrier obligations imposed by the Interstate Commerce Act against carriers constrained by labor agreements.  See 
id. at 173-174, 83 S. Ct. at 248. "

581,2," The state court action was settled and dismissed on June 4, 1980. "
582,3," The Association also argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Tolkan had failed to show that the 
Association's conduct affected interstate or foreign commerce, and that Tolkan's claims were barred because it had failed to 
demand a share of the Datsun 210 hatchbacks from the Association at the time of the promotion. The district court did not 
address these arguments. "
583,4," The Smith court also noted that the third type of group boycott to which it referred-the refusal to deal by traders at the same 
level as the would-be competitor-is ""relatively rare"" and ""can be effective only where it is necessary for firms at the boycotting 
level to do business with each other, as is true, for example, in the case of brokers."" 593 F.2d at 1178 n.16. It is this third type of 
boycott which is at issue in the instant case."
583,5," Although the Supreme Court opinions in Associated Press and Silver used different analytical frameworks (Associated Press 
was ostensibly a rule of reason case while Silver invoked a variant of per se analysis), we believe that the Supreme Court 
considered and relied upon similar economic factors in reaching both decisions.  It is the absence of these factors which, we 
believe, clearly distinguishes Associated Press and Silver from the instant case. "
584,6," Indeed, although the ability to obtain extra cars for special promotions was cited as a prime motive for forming the Association, 
the record indicates that Datsun was willing to supply promotional vehicles to any Datsun dealer who requested them, 
regardless of membership in an advertising association.  See Dep. of Robert Bower, Nissan Regional Sales Manager, at 66.  
Plaintiff in the instant case received 20 additional 210 hatchbacks from Nissan in lieu of participation in the ongoing Association 
promotion. See Appellant's Brief at 11."
584,7," Because we have found that Tolkan had no clear right to participate in this promotion, we do not regard this alleged injury as 
sufficient to justify per se treatment or, for that matter, to impose Sherman Act liability.  See Part III infra. HN6[
] - "
585,8," It is undisputed that defendant dealers each ordered their 100 promotional cars on March 22, 1979.  These orders were 
approved by Nissan on April 19, 1979.  Tolkan first became a licensed Datsun dealer on May 7, 1979."
585,9," See also Dep. of Phil Tolkan at 59, line 13.  Nor, apparently, did Tolkan Datsun object when it was informed by the Association, 
in July 1979, that its membership application would not be considered until after completion of the 210 promotion. See Letter 
dated July 20, 1979, from Association President Kenneth Ausman, to Tolkan President Thomas Weil.  See also Affidavit of Larry 
Hanke, Secretary-Treasurer of Waukesha Datsun, P 2, Appellee's Appendix at 14. "
586,10," For a discussion of related ""free rider"" problems in other areas of antitrust law, see Posner, The Rule of Reason and the 
Economic Approach: Reflections on the Sylvania Decision, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 6-10 (1977). Cf. Matthew 20:1-20:16 (Parable of 
the Laborers in the Vineyard)."
586,11," Plaintiff argues in its briefs that it was also injured by being excluded from the Association's joint advertising campaign.  This 
argument, however, is circular, in that the only advertising undertaken by the Association during the relevant time period related 
to the special 210 promotion. Because Tolkan had no legal right to participate in this promotion, it could not have suffered a 
legally cognizable harm by being denied the benefit of such advertising. Nor is there any realistic possibility that Tolkan will be 
denied the benefit of any future Association advertising since it was conceded at oral argument that Tolkan is now a fully 
functioning member of the Association.  See note 12 infra. "
587,12," We do not dispute Tolkan's contention that where an antitrust violation has been demonstrated, a court may properly consider 
possible future effects of that violation for purposes of fashioning monetary or injunctive relief.  See, e.g., United States v. W. T. 
Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633-35, 73 S. Ct. 894, 897-898, 97 L. Ed. 1303 (1953). In the instant case, however, plaintiff has failed

597,23," While these special problems have been articulated in a First Amendment context, they are equally relevant to an antitrust 
analysis. An absolute limit on the number of competitors is, to some extent, inconsistent with the free market assumptions which 
underlie conventional antitrust analysis."
597,24," Because of the viewing habits of the public, prime broadcast time is likewise limited and probably not substantially capable of 
expansion. "
598,25," Of course, as discussed below, if on the basis of a complete analysis of all the relevant factors, it is determined that the supply 
restrictions are, in fact, the product of the NAB Code, the challenged practices may properly be enjoined."
598,26," The Rule of Reason dates back to the common law and has been a cornerstone of Sherman Act analysis since 1898. See

598,27, The question of purpose is explored in Part VII infra.
598,28, The multiple product standard presents different problems and is discussed in Part V infra.
598,29," There is, however, a distinction between the purposes for which the inquiry is conducted in a per se analysis and those which 
underlie the Rule of Reason analysis. In rejecting the per se approach, the Court determined only that, in this industry context, 
the Code provisions are not the sort of arrangement properly invalidated per se because the actual effect of the Code upon the 
supply of commercial time is unclear. Under the Rule of Reason, the Court must ascertain the actual effect of the Code 
provisions and uphold or invalidate them depending upon whether that effect is factually anticompetitive."
598,30," In making that determination, it is appropriate to consider factors not unlike those involved in deciding whether the per se rule 
applies; i.e., what inherent limits there are on the amount of commercial time available and the limitations on the amount of such 
time resulting from FCC regulation. "
599,31," The Court must inquire whether the effect on competition is ""substantially adverse."" United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 
388 U.S. 365, 375, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249 (1967), overruled on other grounds, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania,

593 F.2d at 1183 (""significantly anticompetitive""); L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 68, p. 187 (1977)."
599,32," In support of its position on this issue, the government relies on such materials as the 1963 testimony of Peter Kenney, vice 
president of NBC, and that of Mark Evans, vice president of Metromedia, who indicated that the amount of time available for 
commercials governs the rates (Broadcast Advertising: Hearings on H.R. 8316, 8381, 8729, 8896, 8980, 9042 Before the 
Subcomm. on Communications and Power of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st 
Sess., 116, 301 (1963)) as well as on NAB's own statements that the advertising restrictions have an impact on price. See, e.g., 
Comments of the National Association of Broadcasters, In the Matter of Amendment of Part 3 of the Commission's Rules and 
Regulations with Respect to Advertising on Standard, FM, and Television Broadcast Stations, Docket No. 15083, Sept. 30, 
1963, p. 26. The FCC likewise believes that the Code limitations affect the price of commercial time. Letter from Charles Ferris, 
Exhibit A to Supplemental Reply of Defendant, at p. 7. See also pp. 26-27 infra. On the other hand, although counsel for NAB has conceded that the Code has an effect on price (Transcript of Dec. 5, 1979 
Hearing, p. 7), defendant's claim is that ""everything has an impact on price,"" and that the Code has such an effect only in the 
way that every commercial contract, in one sense, imposes a restraint on commercial freedom. Defendant's Supplemental Reply 
Memorandum, p. 6."
599,33," The parties will be expected at trial to produce specific proof concerning the effect of the Code provisions on the supply of that 
time and the relationship between the supply of commercial time and its price. The government might seek to discharge its 
burden of proving, for example, that there is a relationship between the supply limitations inherent in the Code's time standards 
and the price of commercial time by adducing evidence which tends to show that the price non-subscribing stations charge for 
equivalent blocs of time is lower than that charged by Code subscribers. The government might also provide the Court with 
additional evidence regarding the Code's impact upon the television advertising market. Defendant, for its part, might attempt to 
prove that it is the special characteristics of the broadcast industry, not the Code, which restrict the supply of commercial time, 
by demonstrating, for example, that stations which do not subscribe devote the same amount of time to commercials as do 
subscribers. Defendant might also attempt to show that the demand for commercial time is so high that any restriction upon its 
supply caused by the Code provisions has no effect upon price. Needless to say, these examples are only illustrative. They are not meant as directives to the parties nor will they bind the Court 
when the evidence is adduced. Each party will decide for itself how to present its case, and only after the Court has heard the 
evidence will it be able properly to assess the competitive effect of these Code provisions."
599,34," NAB has not directly addressed the standardization point. HN14[
] "
600,35," For example, if two plywood manufacturers agreed upon standards for the different types of plywood they produce, a 
consumer interested in a specific type of wood would be able easily to compare the manufacturers' prices and choose the least 
expensive brand. HN15[
]"
600,36," It is important to recognize that this action does not represent a complaint by a competitor that an industry established by its 
other competitors has adversely affected its product. See, e.g., Structural Laminates, Inc. v. Douglas Fir Plywood Ass'n, 261 
F. Supp. 154 (D. Ore. 1966), aff'd per curiam, 399 F.2d 155 (9th Cir. 1968). Rather, it is alleged in this case that the 
standardization agreement adversely affects the customers of television stations that is, their advertisers and viewers."
600,37," For example, under the Code a station could probably not choose to designate one hour as commercial-free, moving 
additional commercials to another hour in the broadcast day. Similarly, it would be difficult for an independent station to 
broadcast a sixty-minute program during prime time with only a single interruption for commercials while still selling the 
maximum amount of time permitted by the time standards. An independent station may broadcast fourteen minutes of 
commercials in sixty minutes of prime time, but only seven commercials may be broadcast during any single interruption. 
Advertising Standards, XV §§ 2, 4. Thus, each commercial would have to be atypically long, two minutes, in order for the station 
to sell the maximum amount of commercial time permitted by the Code. Similar difficulties may be encountered with respect to 
programs of different lengths and those broadcast in non-prime time. (Network-affiliated stations are apparently not subject to 
this limitation. Regulations XIV § 5.) It might be possible in theory for a station to sell fewer commercials and charge a higher 
price, but the Code appears to preclude some of the stations' options in this regard and to foster a standard arrangement."
600,38," See Nixon v. Freeman, supra."
600,39," Advertising Standards, IX § 5. The Code further provides that this provision does not apply if the commercials are ""integrated 
so as to appear to the viewer as a single message."" Retail and service establishments are exempt from this provision. "
601,40," N.Y. Times, Dec. 8, 1981, § 4 at p. 24 col. 3; id., Jan. 29, 1980, § 4, at p. 16 col. 4."
601,41," The commercial would be acceptable only if it was ""integrated"" so as to fall into the exception to this rule. See note 39, supra."
601,42," NAB claims that the Court may not rely upon some of the documentary evidence submitted by the government. See 
Defendant's Supplemental Reply Brief at p. 29 n. 44. None of these exhibits provide information crucial to the Court's decision. 
They are discussed only to illuminate that decision by providing examples, and to give guidance to the parties in their 
preparation for trial. See also note 40, supra; notes 43-44, infra; pp. 26-27 infra."
601,43, Piggybacks are advertisements containing messages for two or more products in a single commercial.
601,44," The chief counsel of Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. stated that the proposal would penalize the small television advertiser, and 
the president of Alberto-Culver Company likewise noted that it would end the participation of many small advertisers in the 
medium. The Alberto-Culver witness further commented that multi-product commercials permit an advertiser to use an already 
profitable product to support much of the expense of introducing a new product, and he unfavorably compared the piggyback 
rule with newspaper and magazine practice (which do not require advertisers to restrict their advertisements to a single product)."
601,45," The government has labelled all of the Code provisions at issue in this case as supply restrictions. Plaintiff's Memorandum in 
Opposition to Motion to Dismiss at p. 11."
601,46," In a free market, absent the NAB Code, there would be no obstacle to the promotion by an advertiser of several of his 
products in a shorter, and necessarily less expensive, period of time. "
602,47," Agreements affecting demand fall within the per se rule against price fixing for the same reasons as agreements artificially 
affecting supply: absent special circumstances, both ""interfere with the setting of price by free market forces."" United States v. 
Container Corp. of America, supra, 393 U.S. at p. 337. See pp. 6-7, supra."
602,48," Defendant would distinguish National Macaroni on three bases. It argues, first, that the court in that case found both an 
anticompetitive purpose and an anticompetitive effect. Subsequent decisional law establishes that only one of these is 
necessary for an antitrust violation. See Part VII infra. Second, defendant asserts that the Code is not broadly applicable. 
However, it is clear that the NAB Code has the same dominance in the broadcasting industry that the trade association 
agreement had in National Macaroni. Code subscribers have eighty-five percent of the television viewers in the United States, 
and in addition, as NAB has conceded, the Code has a significant spillover effect which causes many non-subscribers to adhere 
to its provisions. NAB Comments before the Federal Trade Commission, In the Matter of Proposed Trade Regulation Rule: 
Children's Advertising, supra, at p. 10; Testimony of Stockton Helffrich before the Federal Communications Commission, In the 
Matter of a Petition of Action for Children's Television, Docket No. 19143, at p. 709. Third, defendant claims that the Code has 
procompetitive effects in that the supposed alternative -- government regulation -- would apply to all television stations while the 
Code applies only to subscribers. But if Congress chose to impose standards, either directly or through the Federal 
Communications Commission, compliance with the congressional directive would obviously not be an antitrust violation. In any 
event, the agreement's procompetitive effects must be assessed by examining the state of the industry in the absence of the 
challenged agreement rather than on the basis of hypotheticals."
602,49," To be sure, in National Macaroni it was the defendants' demand for products that was being affected by the offending practice 
while in the instant case it is the demand of third parties. But as the discussion of tying arrangements infra demonstrates, in 
appropriate circumstances the antitrust laws are violated in the latter situation as well as the former."
602,50," Manufacturers and other sellers may obviously use advertising and other forms of persuasion to increase the demand for their 
products, and they might even be free to do so on the basis of concerted action. But the multiple product standard is not a form 
of persuasion but a coercive device which leaves an advertiser with no option with respect to his demand for commercial time: if 
he desires to promote more than one product he must increase his demand for such time to sixty seconds per commercial 
announcement. "
603,51," The effect, if any, of the special characteristics of the industry would be to reduce the total supply of commercial time. These 
characteristics do not impact upon the operation of a rule which further reduces the availability of this supply to consumers."
603,52," Even in an industry with unusual or special characteristics, a court is not precluded from finding a per se violation where, as 
here, the practice under scrutiny is itself clearly anticompetitive and where, again as here, the industry's features do not vitiate 
the anticompetitive effect."
603,53," See L. Sullivan, Antitrust, supra, at § 155."
603,54," The antitrust laws might not prohibit an individual television station from requiring advertisers to purchase a minimum amount 
of time, for such a requirement, to the extent that it is unreasonable, could be rectified by market forces. NAB's concerted action 
prevents these market forces from operating. "
604,55," Defendant cites a number of cases to the contrary but none of these supports its position. In United States v. American 
Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 147 (S.I. N.Y. 1979), the court held only that the government had failed to show 
that the Society's fee guide fixed prices or otherwise had an anticompetitive effect, and, indeed, in order to reach that 
conclusion, it necessarily had to find first that the guide was an agreement under the Sherman Act. In the two other decisions 
cited by defendant -- Tropic Film Corp. v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 319 F. Supp. 1247 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) and Hughes Tool Co. v. 
Motion Picture Ass'n of America, 66 F. Supp. 1006 (S.D.N.Y. 1946) -- the issue was whether the agreement constituted a group 
boycott, not whether it failed to satisfy the statute's jurisdictional requirement."
604,56," It might be relevant to the reasonableness issue that the agreed-upon standard was advisory rather than mandatory, in the 
sense that the parties to the agreement did not promise to abide by its terms and that violation is not penalized in any way. See 
United States v. American Society of Anesthesiologists, supra. The NAB Code clearly cannot be classified as advisory. See 
notes 59-62 and accompanying text, infra. "
605,57," To put it another way, there is on this question no genuine issue of material fact."
605,58, See note 56 supra.
605,59, Regulations III.
605,60," These tasks are carried out by the Code Authority which has an annual budget of approximately $ 770,000. It checks stations' 
adherence to the Code by examining copies of their program logs on a random basis for one or two five-day periods each year. 
Detailed reports of the results of this monitoring are compiled and they are discussed at meetings of the NAB Television Code 
Board. See Exhibits 1-4 to Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief. Subscribers who fail to observe the Code's requirements are subject to 
disciplinary proceedings and, if found in ""continuing, willful or gross violation,"" they lose the right to display the NAB Television 
Seal of Good Practice. Regulations III § 4."
605,61," Testimony of Stockton Helffrich before the Federal Communications Commission, In the Matter of Petition of Action for 
Children's Television, supra, at p. 710. A survey conducted by NAB in 1965 found that a substantial number of advertisers were 
interested in knowing whether a station on which they intended to advertise was a Code subscriber and that some preferred to 
advertise on stations which subscribed to the Code. Exhibit 15 to Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief."
605,62," NAB Comments before the Federal Trade Commission, In the Matter of Proposed Trade Regulation Rule: Children's 
Advertising, supra, at p. 10."
605,63," NAB also cites two reports, one by the Attorney General and one by the Federal Communications Commission, but both of 
these, too, merely state in conclusory terms that the Code is ineffective. The Commission has twice found the Code sufficiently 
effective to decline to issue regulations concerning subjects it governs. See Children's Television Report and Policy Statement, 
50 F.C.C.2d 1, 13 (1974); Report and Order, 36 F.C.C. 45, 50 (1964)."
605,64," A similar conclusion was reached in Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. v. FCC, 423 F. Supp. 1064, 1123-25 (C.D. Cal. 
1976), rev'd on other grounds, 609 F.2d 355 (9th Cir. 1979), in which the court, in another context, characterized the Code as a 
""joint attempt to monopolize the nation's airwaves."" 423 F. Supp. at 1143."
605,65," NAB may introduce proof on this question at trial if it advances a credible legal theory demonstrating the relevance of such 
proof to the reasonableness of the two types of Code provisions which will be the subject of that trial. "
606,66," The Court's only reservation was that ""consideration of intent may play an important role in divining the actual nature and 
effect of the alleged anticompetitive conduct."" Id. To the same effect, see Foster v. Maryland State Savings and Loan Ass'n., 590 
F.2d 928, 936 n. 3, 191 U.S. App. D.C. 226 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Leventhal, J. concurring)."
606,67," As the case will go to trial, the government may, of course, offer proof of such purpose."
606,68," Defendant relies to the contrary upon AFTRA v. NAB, 407 F. Supp. 900 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), but that case predates the Supreme 
Court's opinion in Gypsum."
606,69," It would not be unreasonable, at least, prima facie, to conclude from the broadcasters' desire to tailor their Code to the 
economic circumstances of the various members and the relative financial rewards to be gained in various time periods that 
competitive concerns govern Code decisions."
606,70," Memoranda from Code Authority Staff dated June 10, 1963 and June 24, 1963. Exhibits 18 and 19 to Plaintiff's Supplemental 
Brief."
606,71," See, e.g., affidavits of Howard H. Bell, former director of the NAB Code Authority, and William H. Tankersley, former member 
of the NAB Television Code Review Board. Exhibits A, B to Defendant's Supplemental Brief. Mr. Bell has also stated that the 
""question of rates has never been a consideration in the adoption of Code policies and standards."" Letter from Mr. Bell to E. 
William Henry, Chairman of the FCC dated December 1, 1965. "
607,72," Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra."
607,73," The program interruption standards and the multiple product standard are said to be in the public interest because they 
prevent ""clutter,"" i.e., ""the practice of scheduling an excessive number of separate non-program announcements consecutively 
within a single interruption as well as . . . an excessive number of program interruptions."" National Society of Professional 
Engineers v. United States, supra is as decisive on this subject as it is in regard to defendant's other public interest arguments 
(and, as noted in Part V supra, the multiple product standard is not subject to challenge in any event). Moreover, any basis for NAB's ""clutter"" defense is undermined by NAB's policy of restricting those able to purchase less than 
sixty seconds of commercial time to the promotion of a single product while, as far as the record before the Court shows, the 
purchaser of sixty seconds of time is permitted to advertise four, five, or six products during that period. No more clutter is 
produced by a thirty-second commercial which promotes two products than by a sixty-second commercial which advertises four 
products. Yet under the multiple product standard the latter is permitted, the former is forbidden. Clutter may well be undesirable; 
but it is most effectively dealt with, not by an agreement among the broadcasters which maximizes their financial gain, but by 
market forces which, by penalizing those whose commercial announcements offend the public, impartially reduce all clutter on 
an equal basis."
607,74," Only where there is no anticompetitive effect and the parties have a legitimate purpose will agreements among competitors 
which restrain their commercial activities usually be upheld.  National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, supra, "
608,435," U.S. at p. 696 n. 22; Neeld v. National Hockey League, supra; Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., supra, 593 F.2d at pp. 1188-89 & 
n. 68."
608,75," As stated above, the Court need not, and does not, decide that question."
608,76," It is not necessary to consider here the extent to which other considerations may be relevant in other contexts (e.g., relief by 
way of divestiture). See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 91 F. Supp. 333, 416 (S.D.N.Y. 1950)."
608,77," See notes 79-80 infra. Congress could, of course, have exempted television broadcasting, the NAB, or the NAB Code, from 
the antitrust laws and it may do so at any time hereafter."
608,78," An overwhelming portion of NAB's several briefs has been devoted to the public interest arguments, although, as indicated in 
the text, the Court is not free even to consider that defense. It is expected that at trial defendant will concentrate on the 
economic issues which are central to this case. Defendant's ""public interest"" evidence will be considered at that time only to the 
extent that it relates to the effect of the Code provision on competition (e.g., pp. 11-12 supra) or that it counters a claim of 
anticompetitive purpose."
608,79," Congress has done just that on a number of occasions (e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 1012 (insurance); 49 U.S.C. § 1384 (air 
transportation); 15 U.S.C. § 62 (export trade associations))."
608,80," See, e.g., Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, 422 U.S. 659, 95 S. Ct. 2598, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463 (1975); Otter Tail Power Co.

609,81," See note 80, supra. Defendant therefore could not rely upon statements of various officials of the Department of Justice and of 
the Federal Communications Commission as support for some species of immunity from antitrust action."
609,82," Defendant's supplemental Reply Brief at p. 24. Many of the arguments made in defendant's earlier briefs suggested that its 
Code activities had, in effect, been immunized."
609,83," But see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, 310 U.S. at 225-27; Eugene Dietzgen Co. v. FTC, 142 F.2d 321, 
328-29 (7th Cir. 1944)."
609,84," That support, by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, is found in H.R. Rep. No. 1054, 88th Cong., 1st 
Sess. (1963). NAB also cites Possible Anticompetitive Effects of Sale of Network Television Advertising: Hearings Before the 
Subcomm. on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966) in support of its 
claim that the Senate Commerce Committee likewise endorsed the principle of self regulation. The Committee may well have 
done so, but no such endorsement is found in the cited hearings."
609,85," The House committee only said that ""self-regulation by industry is an accepted and valuable supplemental regulatory tool, the 
effective use of which should be encouraged rather than discouraged."" H.R. Rep. No. 1054, supra, at p. 5."
609,86," There is no factual evidence to support the proposition that those who expressed approval of the self-regulation concept 
meant that approval to stand as a government sanction of the three sets of advertising standards at issue in this lawsuit."
609,87," The letter, from Assistant Attorney General Lee Loevinger (Exhibit B to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss), states that the 
Department was sympathetic to NAB's goal of establishing ""standards of good taste and ethical conduct"" and that these goals 
""would appear to be both commendable and in the public interest."" NAB recognized at the time that the Justice Department letter 
provided little support for the Code, noting in its reply that ""we were hopeful that your response could be much stronger."" Letter 
from LeRoy Collins, Exhibit B to Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion to Dismiss."
609,88," See, e.g., Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees [Blue Book], FCC Report (1946), p. 56; Report and Order, 36 
F.C.C. 45, 50 (1964); In re RKO General, Inc., 44 F.C.C.2d 1223, 133 (1973); In re Lamar Life Broadcasting Co., 3 F.C.C.2d 
784, 786 n. 1 (1966). In a letter dated October 22, 1979 (while this litigation was pending) then Chairman Ferris of the FCC 
wrote to the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Communications that the Commission ""has been willing to accept the 
possibility of increased prices in order to achieve, through industry self-regulation, other public benefits."" Chairman Ferris was 
also quick to point out, however, that the Commission ""has never undertaken an antitrust review, as such, of the NAB Code""; 
that this is a Justice Department responsibility; and that the FCC has ""never been asked to give antitrust-type blessing to the 
Code."" Exhibit A to Supplemental Reply Memorandum of Defendant. "
610,89," E.g., In re National Broadcasting Co., 20 F.C.C.2d 644, 645 (1969). However, the Commission has always looked to the 
individual licensees on a case-by-case basis for their own performance, not to that of an umbrella organization (see Report and 
Order, 36 F.C.C. 45, 49-50 (1964) and licensee violations of the NAB Code are not penalized by the FCC."
610,90," One additional NAB contention in opposition to the grant of summary judgment to the government may be dismissed 
summarily. In its final brief, NAB contends that the government's motion must be denied because NAB ""has not been given 
sufficient opportunity to pursue pretrial discovery."" Defendant's Supplemental Reply Brief at p. 30 n. 49. There is no basis 
whatever for this assertion. There appears to be no reason why NAB could not have engaged in discovery during the extended 
period while this action has been pending. In addition, it is likely that NAB would, more than anyone else, be in possession of 
information regarding the purpose and effect of its own Code standards. "
615,1," While Consolidated is the marketing agent for NDA, the testimony was that each producer cooperative determines the price at 
which it will sell its milk. "
616,2, There is no contention in this suit that Consolidated's processing activities were in unfair competition with Bar-T.
616,3," The defendants' evidence showed that Bar-T packaged its milk in plastic bags, which frequently leaked, causing a high rate of 
rejection.  Their theory was that the failure of Bar-T's business was due to poor management.  But the jury evidently was not 
persuaded that this was the cause of Bar-T's losses. "
619,4," As the district judge observed in a footnote in Northern Cal. Supermarkets, Inc. v. Central Cal. Lettuce Producers Coop., supra, 
cases where courts have found predatory practices have involved serious coercive conduct aimed at bringing nonmember 
producers into the cooperative or achieving monopoly through threats, boycotts and interference with others.  See, e.g., 
Maryland & Va. Milk Producers Ass'n v. United States, supra; Fairdale Farms, Inc. v. Yankee Milk, Inc., supra; Bergjans Farm 
Dairy Co. v. Sanitary Milk Producers, 241 F. Supp. 476 (E.D. Mo. 1965), aff'd, 368 F.2d 679 (8th Cir. 1966); In re Washington 
Crab Ass'n, 66 F.T.C. 45 (1964); North Tex. Producers Ass'n v. Metzger Dairies, Inc., 348 F.2d 189 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 
382 U.S. 977, 15 L. Ed. 2d 468, 86 S. Ct. 545 (1966). See also Treasure Vly. Potato Bargaining Ass'n v. Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., 
497 F.2d 203, 216 n.11 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 999, 42 L. Ed. 2d 273, 95 S. Ct. 314 (1974). "
620,5," The question whether prices were ""unduly enhanced"" was not at issue in this lawsuit, although Bar-T elicited from two farmers 
an account of their income over a period of years, for the purpose of showing that farmers were not experiencing a sufficient 
degree of hardship to warrant the raising of prices.  There is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the income of these farmers 
reflected a return on investment and labor higher than that generally received by persons (whether farmers or other 
entrepreneurs) in a comparable position. "
621,," The Capper-Volstead Act reposes in the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to issue a cease and desist order if it finds that 
monopolization has occurred to the extent that prices are unduly enhanced. 7 U.S.C. § 292. See P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law § 228 (1978); Northern Cal. Supermarkets, Inc. v. Central Cal. Lettuce Producers Coop., 413 F. Supp. 984, 993 
n.9 (N.D. Cal. 1976). It appears that the Secretary has never issued such an order.  No court, insofar as we can ascertain, has 
ever proposed to usurp the Secretary's authority in this area. Washington's ""little Capper-Volstead Act"" places upon the Attorney General, rather than the director of the Department of 
Agriculture, the responsibility for determining when prices have been unduly enhanced as a result of monopolization or restraint 
of trade (RCW 24.34.020), in which event he is authorized to issue, after a hearing, a cease and desist order.  It appears that he, 
like the United States Secretary of Agriculture, has never found it appropriate to issue such an order. "

627,5," ""Wheeling"" power refers to transmitting power sold by one utility to another over the lines of a third utility not involved in the

628,6," There is some dispute over whether any of the claims other than the price squeeze were adequately pleaded in Kirkwood's

628,9," Kirkwood has appeared before the FERC to challenge UE's proposed wholesale rate increases, to no avail.  Moreover, once 
the FERC approves rate increases, it has no power to invalidate rates retroactively or order other relief if the rates are later 
found to be unreasonable.  16 U.S.C. § 824d(e).  In addition, FERC cannot remedy Kirkwood's problem on its own.  Neither it 
nor the Missouri PSC has jurisdiction over the relationship as such between wholesale and retail rates.  It is this relationship, 
rather than the unreasonableness of either the wholesale or the retail rate structure standing alone, that creates the problem of 
which Kirkwood complains. "
629,10," In Otter Tail the Supreme Court held a utility's refusal to wheel subject to antitrust challenge, and in Cantor the Court denied 
antitrust immunity to a utility which distributed ""free"" light bulbs to residential consumers.  The plaintiff in Cantor, who sold light 
bulbs at retail, claimed that tying the distribution of a non-monopoly item (light bulbs) to a monopoly item (electricity) constituted 
illegal use of monopoly power to restrain competition.  Although Detroit Edison's light-bulb-exchange program was part of an 
approved tariff and therefore could not be altered without the approval of the Michigan Public Service Commission, the Court 
refused to imply immunity on that basis."
629,11," This Court recently summarized these and other implied-immunity cases in Sound, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 631 F.2d 
1324, 1327-31 (8th Cir. 1980) (no implied immunity for telecommunications industry under the Federal Communications Act of 
1934)."

630,14," Although Arkla demonstrates the current vitality of the filed-rate doctrine, the case is clearly distinguishable from the facts of 
the instant case.  In Arkla, the Supreme Court faced a conflict between state contract law and federal rate regulation and 
decided that the latter preempted the former.  ""Under the filed rate doctrine, when there is a conflict between the filed rate and 
the contract rate, the filed rate controls."" 101 S. Ct. at 2933. Here we have a claimed conflict between federal rate regulation and 
federal antitrust regulation, and Supremacy Clause considerations do not come into play when a court balances competing 
federal rules. "
631,15," This Court in a recent review of the state-action doctrine concluded that HN12[
] the following factors are relevant to a 
determination of whether the exemption applies: the existence and nature of any relevant statutorily expressed policy; the nature of the regulatory agency's interpretation and 
application of its enabling statute, including the accommodation of competition by the regulator; the fairness of subjecting a 
regulated private defendant to the mandates of antitrust law; and the nature and extent of the state's interest in the specific 
subject matter of the challenged activity. Sound, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 631 F.2d at 1334. Because we find Cantor and Midcal to be dispositive on the issue, 
we do not go into all of these factors in detail."
631,16," In the briefs filed by the FERC in relation to the petitions for certiorari in Mishawaka I and Mishawaka II, the FERC expressed 
its view that antitrust claims (such as price squeezes) can be more effectively and appropriately tried before the courts and thus 
should not be considered by regulatory commissions.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, Ind. & Mich. Elec. Co.

1964), while others have seemingly ignored it.  See In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution MDL No. 31, supra, 481 F.2d at 129. 
Some have construed standing narrowly, Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew's Inc., 193 F.2d 51 (9th Cir. 1951); others have 
broadly interpreted standing to encompass plaintiffs who were not engaged in the market which was the object of the unlawful 
activity.  See Hoopes, supra, 374 F.2d at 485; Steiner, supra, 232 F.2d at 193; Karseal, supra, 221 F.2d at 364-65. Hopefully, a 
broader analytical framework for examining antitrust standing which expressly accounts for the policy considerations that 
underlie the ""target area"" test will yield more consistent and principled results."

Against Wrongful Discharge: The Duty to Terminate Only in Good Faith, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1816, 1816-24 (1980). The dissent argues Ostrofe has a wrongful discharge cause of action under California law.  But the California doctrine is only a 
minority rule.  Effective enforcement of federal antitrust laws cannot be made to depend upon the availability of alternate 
remedies under varying local law. The dissent's contention that allowing antitrust standing to an employee discharged for refusal to participate in an antitrust 
violation pretermits state employer-employee relations law ""by heavy-handed interference from the federal courts"" is specious.  
The overlap is minimal; our holding pertains only to employee terminations in furtherance of antitrust violations and not to the 
discharge of an employee for any other reason.  As we demonstrate, infra, Ostrofe's termination lies within the core of 
Congressional concern underlying the antitrust laws. "

GAF manufactured floortile.  Defendant Circle Floor Co. installed floortile and was a customer of GAF.  Circle Floor attempted to 
acquire working control of GAF to gain a competitive advantage over other manufacturers and contract installers.  As a part of 
the attempt to take over, defendant reduced its purchases from GAF thereby depressing the market price of GAF's stock.  The 
court denied GAF standing to sue Circle Floor Co. under Section 4.  The court held that the takeover would not have resulted in 
anticompetitive harm to GAF.  Id. at 759. GAF did not allege that its position in the market was or would be affected.  Unlike the 
instant case and those cited supra at N.5, GAF was not driven out of business, terminated, or forced to comply at its own 
economic expense with the anticompetitive demands by the defendants. With regard to the reduction of Circle Floor Co.'s purchases from GAF, the court held Circle Floor Co. had not alleged that the 
""refusal to deal"" was either concerted or that it had diminished GAF's total sales or otherwise injured GAF.  Id. at 759. The court 
did not suggest that an effective refusal to deal in furtherance of an anticompetitive goal would not have conferred standing had 
GAF been in fact injured thereby."

1980), cert. granted, 454 U.S. 1141, 102 S. Ct. 998, 71 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1982), referred approvingly to a ""zone of interests"" test 
adopted by the Sixth and Third Circuits.  Even the Sixth Circuit, however, has modified its views expressed in Malamud v. 
Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1975), which was cited in California State Council of Carpenters.  In Chrysler Corp. v. 
Fedders Corp., 643 F.2d 1229 (6th Cir. 1981), the court held that Brunswick ""clearly establishes that a plaintiff must plead an 
injury of the type § 4 was intended to remedy before his case will be heard,"" id. at 1234, and the court imposed the requirement 
that a plaintiff plead antitrust injury in addition to its zone of interests standing standard, id. at 1234-35. It should be noted that, as modified in light of Brunswick, the Sixth Circuit's zone of interests test differs from this circuit's target 
area test only in that the former ""does not inject an element of proximate cause into the standing inquiry,"" but rather reserves the 
issue of ""directness"" as one to be resolved upon a factual showing.  643 F.2d at 1235-36. Under this new ""zone of interests"" test 
of the Sixth Circuit, the plaintiff here would not have standing, because he has not alleged ""antitrust injury,"" but rather improper 
employee discharge, a tort or contract type of injury. It should be noted also that the Third Circuit did not adopt a ""zone of interests"" test, but rather a test applying a number of 
factors, including direct injury and target area considerations, to each factual matrix.  Cromar Co. v. Nuclear Materials & 
Equipment Corp., 543 F.2d 501, 506 (3d Cir. 1973). That circuit also has included Brunswick's antitrust injury requirement in the 
factors to be considered in determining standing.  Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 582-
83 (3d Cir. 1979). "
655,2," .  In an explicit acknowledgment that precedent points to a conclusion contrary to its own, the majority writes: ""Brunswick could 
be read as limiting section 4 to suits for damages caused by the anticompetitive effect of the particular antitrust violation. Similar 
language appears in lower court opinions. 24"" Majority opinion at 1387.  Study of the footnote signal reveals a string citation of 
three cases in which the second and third cases listed are opinions of our own court, squarely contrary to the theory of the 
majority here.  In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M. D. L. No. 31, 481 F.2d 122 (9th Cir. 1973); Conference of Studio Unions 
v. Loew's Inc., 193 F.2d 51 (9th Cir. 1951). At an earlier point, the majority writes that ""(t)he courts have devised various ""tests' 
for standing to sue,"" majority opinion at 1382.  Again, in a string cite in footnote 6, is a case setting forth this circuit's target area 
test.  I doubt the concept of the law of the circuit properly could be treated in such cavalier fashion even by an advocate, and for 
a majority on a panel of this court to do so is cause for surprise and dismay. "

whether or not the state enforces its regulations or whether such enforcement is effective.  The mere existence of regulatory 
statutes capable of being enforced apparently is all that is required for the McCarran Act exemption to be applicable. Id.  This broad interpretation has been subject to criticism. We do not reach the issue whether the court correctly interpreted or 
applied this provision of the McCarran Act because it has never been raised on appeal.  See notes 16-17 infra and

688,17," .  The majority of courts have found the McCarran Act's ""state regulation"" requirement easily satisfied by a general scheme for 
regulating the conduct of insurance companies.  E.g., Ohio AFL-CIO v. Insurance Rating Bd., 451 F.2d 1178 (6th Cir. 1971), 
cert. denied, 409 U.S. 917, 93 S. Ct. 215, 34 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1972); see Sullivan & Wiley, Recent Antitrust Developments:

(hereinafter cited as ""Sullivan & Wiley""). Other courts have, however, applied a stricter standard.  See, e.g., United States v. Crocker Nat'l Corp., 656 F.2d 428, 452-55 
(9th Cir. 1981) (state law must regulate the specific practices challenged under federal antitrust laws; state and federal law

(insurance company merger properly challenged under federal securities laws; state statute designed to protect policyholders, 
under which state approved the challenged merger, held not in conflict with federal securities laws).  Commentators have also 
argued for more rigorous scrutiny of state regulation.  E.g., Weller, supra note 16, at 602-19; Weller, To Preempt or To

689,19, .  See notes 21-24 infra and accompanying text.
689,20, .  As noted in one commentary on Royal Drug : 
690,," There is a question about the relationship of the ""between insurer and insured"" and the ""risk spreading"" tests.  The Court refers 
to the latter as ""an indispensable characteristic of insurance,"" (440 U.S.) at 212 (99 S. Ct. at 1073), while the former is only 
described as ""(a)nother commonly understood aspect of the business of insurance,"" id. at 215 (99 S. Ct. at 1075). This wording 
suggests that the ""between insurer and insured"" test is of less importance than the risk spreading requirement.  Since Group 
Life's pharmacy agreements were found to fail on both counts, however, this implication is not a necessary result of the case's 
holding.  The Court's failure to clarify this relationship, as well as its rather unrelated discussion of cooperative ratemaking … 
leaves much to be desired by those seeking a confident prediction of the boundaries of ""the business of insurance."" Sullivan & Wiley, supra note 17, at 282 n.77; see also Case Comment, 65 Minn.L.Rev. 1187, 1195-96 (1981)."

that ""after the ""risk-reducing' policy terms are eliminated, all that remains is the most basic model of the insurance contract,"" and 
suggesting that ""the Court's second argument (in Royal Drug ), that the business of insurance is limited to the insurer-
policyholder relationship … seems superfluous""); Sullivan & Wiley, supra note 17, at 282-83 (measures to reduce either the 
magnitude or the probability of risk are not part of the ""business of insurance"" under Royal Drug ). Other commentators have argued that the ""business of insurance"" does not include any insurance company practice that has an 
anticompetitive impact outside the insurance industry.  See Weller, supra note 16, at 632; Note, Qualified Immunity for Insurers

Supp. 564, 568-69 (D.Minn.1981) (insurer's payment formula providing different levels of payment for member and nonmember

underwrite risk); United States v. Title Ins. Rating Bureau, 517 F. Supp. 1053, 1058 (D.Ariz.1981) (insurers' provision of escrow 
services to policyholders not ""business of insurance"" because it does not involve ""any actual underwriting of risk-spreading""). "
691,24," .  In both Quality Auto Body and Workman, however, the McCarran Act exemption was an alternative holding.  Both courts also 
held that summary judgment was appropriate because the plaintiffs' evidence was inadequate to establish a claim under the 
Sherman Act."
691,25," .  The Court in Royal Drug did note that the position taken by this Court of Appeals in Proctor was in conflict with the position of 
the Fifth Circuit in Royal Drug.  440 U.S. at 208-09 n.2, 99 S. Ct. at 1071-72 n.2. Since the Fifth Circuit in Royal Drug decided 
only whether the pharmacy agreements in that case qualified for exemption as the ""business of insurance"" and did not even 
discuss the status of horizontal agreements under the McCarran Act, it is reasonable to assume that the Court found Proctor's 
ruling on the vertical arrangements, not its ruling on the horizontal claim, in conflict with the Fifth Circuit position. "
692,26," .  See 90 Cong.Rec. A4406 (1944) (text of NAIC bill).  The seven practices listed in the NAIC bill were not included in the law

with insurance company held to constitute the ""business of insurance"")."
692,28," .  The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has recently submitted a memorandum for the United States as amicus 
curiae in an ongoing suit that is factually similar to this one. The memorandum concludes that, under Royal Drug, vertical 
arrangements between individual insurers and automobile body repair shops concerning the price of repairs are not the 
""business of insurance"" under the McCarran Act after Royal Drug.  Memorandum of the United States as Amicus Curiae at 5-7, 
D&B Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., No. 79-0550 (D.R.I.).  By contrast, it concludes that an agreement among insurers ""to 
provide reimbursement only for the competitive or prevailing cost of repair would … be immune from the antitrust laws if 
regulated by state law."" Id. at 21 (citing the District Court's decision on remand in Proctor II ). The memorandum also mentions 
that the McCarran Act would not immunize horizontal ""agreements that do not modify the insurer's obligation to the policyholder, 
but merely relate to the insurance companies' role as purchasers of repair services."" Id. (citing Royal Drug ).  This statement 
renders the position of the Antitrust Division somewhat ambiguous, but its approving citation of the District Court's decision in 
Proctor II indicates that it views the horizontal agreement in this case as the ""business of insurance."" "
693,29," .  We recognize that Royal Drug can conceivably be read as establishing a strict subject-matter test of the ""business of 
insurance."" This, in fact, seems to be appellants' basic argument on appeal.  Under this view of Royal Drug, it does not matter 
whether the agreement is wholly intra-industry or one between an insurer and providers of services outside the insurance 
industry. Rather, if the subject matter of the agreement concerns goods or services other than just insurance, the agreement 
cannot be the ""business of insurance,"" no matter how closely it otherwise pertains to ratemaking or to other practices 
traditionally regarded as the core of the ""business of insurance."" We do not accept this argument.  If the Court had intended to 
establish a simple test of the ""business of insurance,"" which would (1) exclude any agreement pertaining to the provision of 
goods and services other than insurance or (2) ban any practice having an impact on a non-insurance market, it could have 
stated the test simply.  It did not.  Indeed, the Court's decision in Royal Drug was specifically tailored to be the vertical 
agreements it considered in that case. We therefore decline to impose so sweeping an interpretation on Royal Drug in the 
absence of a clearer indication from the Court. We recognize further that Royal Drug can be read to allow a McCarran Act antitrust exemption for intra-industry agreements 
and/or information sharing only insofar as they pertain to the ""distribution of risk according to hazard, experience, and the laws of 
averages (because) these factors are not within the control of insuring companies in the sense that the producer or manufacturer 
may control cost factors."" Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 221, 99 S. Ct. at 1078 (quoting from H.R.Rep.No.873, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 
8-9 (1943)).  We reject this suggestion primarily because it ignores the views of the majority in Royal Drug indicating that 
horizontal agreements pertaining to cooperative ratemaking, if subject to State regulation, are probably protected by the 
McCarran Act."
693,30," .  An insurer, of course, is concerned not only with the number or frequency of covered losses that its insureds incur, but also 
with the extent of financial liability that it will incur as a result of those losses.  A prediction of that financial liability is necessary to 
the proper calculation of insurance premiums and is necessarily a function of the probability of a given loss and the magnitude of 
that loss if it occurs.  See generally Affidavit of Alan C. Curry (Vice-President and Actuary of State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance Co.), Record, vol. 9, entry no. 253 (affidavit in support of March 17, 1975 Motion for Summary Judgment).  The 
""expected cost"" to the insurance company of this financial liability is the sum of the products of the probabilities of each covered 
loss and the cost of that loss should it occur. Mathematically, it is expressed as: "
694,31," .  In deciding that the vertical arrangements constituted the ""business of insurance,"" the Court of Appeals in Proctor relied in 
part upon the impact on premium levels of costs of damage claim payments.  561 F.2d at 268-70 & n.11. This ""effect on 
insurance rates"" approach has been criticized.  See, e.g., Nedrow, The McCarran Controversy: Insurance and the Antitrust 
Law, 12 Conn.L.Rev. 205, 238-39 (1980); Weller, supra note 16, at 625-26."
694,32," .  In its first decision in this case, the District Court noted that ""the statutes of Pennsylvania and Virginia which control the 
establishment of insurance rates require that the cost of paying claims be reflected in level of premiums to be charged."" Proctor 
I, 406 F. Supp. at 29 n.1. (The Pennsylvania and Virginia statutes require, in part, that, in making all insurance rates, ""due 
consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this (state) …."" Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, § 
1183 (Purdon 1971); Va.Code § 38.1-252(3) (1981)).  Such state regulation does not, of course, necessarily prove that the 
subject of the regulation is the ""business of insurance,"" but appellants have not challenged the ruling of the District Court on this 
point."
694,33," .  We realize that the Supreme Court viewed the pharmacy agreements in Royal Drug as indistinguishable from general cost-
saving arrangements even though, as the dissent put it, they ""directly obtain the very benefits promised in the (insurance) policy 
and therefore directly affect rates, cost, and insurer reliability …."" Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 252-53, 99 S. Ct. at 1093-94 
(Brennan, J., dissenting).  However, the pharmacy agreements in Royal Drug did not involve the sharing of information for the 
purpose of ratemaking. Rather, the agreements involved a single insurer's purchase of goods and services from a relatively few 
providers outside the insurance industry.  In contrast, the activity complained of here concerned the sharing of cost data to 
determine the prevailing rate to be used in writing damage estimates, and thus to determine the expected magnitude of loss 
payments. "
695,34," .  While this reasoning echoes to an extent the argument of the dissent in Royal Drug that the pharmacy agreements 
constituted the ""business of insurance"" ""because they … themselves constitute a critical element of risk ""prediction,' "" 440 U.S. 
at 252-53, 99 S. Ct. at 1093-94 (Brennan, J., dissenting), we do not read the majority's opinion as precluding consideration of 
the extent to which a practice is related to ratemaking, i.e., predicting risk probability or magnitude of loss."
695,35, .  See note 33 supra.
695,36," .  Appellants rely on Liberty Glass Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 607 F.2d 135 (5th Cir. 1979). In that case, however, the court 
considered, and found unprotected by the McCarran Act, an ""arrangement between the insurers and the manufacturer and 
installer of automobile replacement glass …."" Id. at 137. Although more than one insurer was involved, the arrangement 
considered was essentially a vertical one, initiated by the glass manufacturer allegedly for the purpose of effectuating a scheme 
of price-fixing, price discrimination, territorial market allocation, monopolization, and elimination of competition in the automobile 
glass replacement market.  Id. at 136. That arrangement is thus distinguishable from appellants' claim of a price-fixing 
agreement among appellees in this case. "

Practice Manual"" and correspondence from repair shops informing insurers of their current rates and services); note 59 infra 
(deposition testimony of appellants indicating that hourly labor rates used in different appellees' damage estimates vary and that 
repair shops set their own labor rates).  Appellees also specifically argue that the same discovery materials relied on by 
appellants to support their claim of a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy provide no support for that claim and, in fact, show the 
absence of such a price-fixing conspiracy. We have conducted an independent review of those materials, giving appellants the 
benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and 
whether appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law."

699,43," .  In one document Mr. Carr notes that appellees Allstate, Nationwide, and State Farm ""develop ""referral' garages which will do 
work sight unseen at the prices estimated by the company appraisers involved.  Allstate, because of volume, has arrangements 
with a number of garages which will give them a break on labor and parts prices, charging rates below the going prices."" App. 
312A. This document does not indicate the rates or prices used by each company's appraisers, much less that they used the 
same rates in writing estimates. (Indeed, appellants' deposition testimony shows that the labor rate used by appellees' 
appraisers differed.  See note 59 infra.) It certainly provides no evidence that appellees conspired to fix the rates they used in 
writing estimates."
699,44," .  The memoranda discuss a variety of issues relating to claims handling, such as the use of ""staff"" or ""company"" appraisers as 
opposed to independent appraisers, training of appraisers, security problems with appraisers, the use of ""competitive"" or 
""referral"" garages to do repair work, and the use of ""drive-in"" inspection and appraisal facilities."
699,45," .  Some of the Liberty Mutual ""Home Office Claims"" memoranda that are cited to support statements about communications 
between appellees concerning price-fixing, Appellants' Brief at 23-27, actually contain information about the relationships 
between certain appellees and repair shops. Again, the documents are not probative of the claim that appellees conspired to fix 
the price of automobile repair work. See, e.g., note 43 supra."
699,46," .  Appellants rely heavily on certain statements in a Liberty Mutual memorandum to its claims personnel containing numerous 
recommendations for reducing claims costs.  Appellants' Brief at 27; App. 375A-84A.  The statements on which appellants rely 
are found in one paragraph in this memorandum. Discussing the use of appraisers in small offices, the memorandum states: If you have any concern about the quality or quantity of back-up garages which will support your appraisers, check with 
competitors, as some of our offices have done, to get leads as to other qualified garages which are likely to be willing to serve us 
in the back-up capacity.  Try the other big companies such as Nationwide, Allstate and State Farm. "
700,," App. 378A.  This paragraph does suggest that there have been some communications between certain appellees about the use 
of specific garages. Reading the document in the light most favorable to appellants, it is possible to infer that ""back-up garages"" 
refers to garages willing to do work at rates that were acceptable to Liberty Mutual.  It does not, however, infer that Liberty 
Mutual had agreed with other insurers on either acceptable rates or acceptable repair shops, or that the insurers even used the 
same cost formula or processing procedures for claims adjustment. These lone two sentences, probably the most probative evidence presented by appellants after years of discovery, surely do not 
require submission of appellants' price-fixing claim to a jury. Assuming Liberty Mutual in fact sought information on back-up 
garages from the other appellees, there is no indication in the document of how the other appellees responded.  Nor is there any 
suggestion that appellees acted collusively vis a vis repair shops; if anything, the recommendation that Liberty Mutual office get 
""leads"" about repair shops suggests that they obtained information which they then pursued independently.  Moreover, that 
Liberty Mutual sought leads from other appellees about garages that would ""support (their) appraisers"" does not suggest that 
appellees' appraisers wrote at the same rates.  (Indeed, appellants' 1972 deposition testimony states that appellees used 
different hourly labor rates in writing estimates. See note 59 infra.) Viewed in conjunction with the other evidence presented by 
appellants, and drawing all reasonable inferences in appellants' favor, this document simply does not provide that additional 
quantum of evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that appellants conspired to fix the price of automobile damage 
repair work."
700,47," .  The State Farm documents show that, based on a survey of labor rates charged by repair shops, State Farm raised the labor 
rate it used in most of the areas surveyed.  App. 194A.  The Travelers' document appears to be a request for information from a 
local office concerning the average labor rate charged by local repair shops. App. 170A."
700,48," .  One document, State Farm Document 100, cited by appellants for the proposition that the term ""prevailing"" labor rate referred 
to the rate set by the insurance companies, Plaintiffs' Memorandum, at 15 n.24, is not found in the record.  Appellants cite five 
other State Farm documents to support the same allegation, all of which we have reviewed carefully.  None provide any support 
for the allegation. "

701,50," .  The August 21, 1970 memorandum concerning Central National Insurance Company of Omaha contains some references to 
communications between insurance companies, which are innocuous for purposes of this suit.  A representative of Central 
suggests, for example, that ""the insurance industry … get together and arrange to have (a type of frame-straightening machine) 
spotted around the country at convenient locations … (to) reduce the cost of repairs."" Home Office Claims Memorandum of 
August 21, 1970, at 2. There is no suggestion in the memorandum that any of the appellees were involved in such a plan.  It also 
notes that Central took part in a series of ""round-table discussions"" with representatives of several insurance companies on 
""subjects of general interest."" Id. at 3.  None of the appellees, however, were among the companies listed.  Finally, Central 
recommended to Liberty Mutual two independent appraisal services.  Id. at 2.  The memorandum, however, reflects no 
discussion of rates or formulas used by these appraisers or by any of the appellees."

history of Allstate's relations with auto body shops in the Philadelphia area. It notes that its relations were strained in the late 
1960s when the prevailing rate increased from six dollars per hour to seven dollars per hour.  Allstate resisted this increase while 
other insurance companies did not.  Its relations with repair shops improved, the document indicates, when Allstate went to 
seven dollars per hour in 1969.  This document provides no evidence that Allstate conspired with the other appellees to fix the 
labor rate."

Plaintiffs' App., vol. II."
701,53," .  For example, State Farm Document 767, Plaintiffs' App., vol. II, is a memorandum about State Farm's response to a repair 
shop that complained that the labor rate used by State Farm was too low. The memorandum states: I commented to him that I felt this was putting the cart before the horse, as it should be the shops that set the labor rates and not 
the insurance companies.  I told him I have only repeated what we have said to him many times before, we as a company do not "
702,," set labor rates, we merely abide by the competitive labor rate in the area, and until such time as all or a substantial majority of 
the shops are charging a higher labor rate we will continue to work on the lower competitive figure. See also Liberty Mutual Document 47, Plaintiffs' App., vol. I (Liberty Mutual maintained its rate of $ 9 per hour even though 
""most insurance companies allegedly are writing at more than $ 9 per hour"")."
702,54," .  See State Farm Documents 249, 930, Plaintiffs' App., vol. II; Nationwide Document 676, Plaintiffs' App., vol. I."
702,55," .  For example, one document discusses a meeting in 1969 between representatives of several insurance companies, including 
appellees Travelers and Nationwide, concerning automobile repair costs. Travelers Document 290, Plaintiffs' App., vol. I.  The 
document notes the general feeling of those present that repair costs were not excessive but were likely to rise in the future.  It 
also notes a discussion about the problem of unskilled workers in the auto repair business and the predominance of small, 
inefficient repair shops. Finally, it discusses an experimental repair shop owned by Travelers and notes that larger and more 
effective shops require a large capital investment.  Another document concerns Nationwide's efforts to estimate the price of labor 
and parts for 1969.  It notes that Nationwide was watching the experimental garage owned by Travelers and that the Travelers 
""manager"" had told Nationwide that a labor rate of $ 7.50 an hour was unprofitable.  Nationwide Document 676, Plaintiffs' App., 
vol. I.  Certain State Farm documents indicate that State Farm received from Nationwide a copy of Nationwide's ""Claims 
Performance Evaluation Guidelines,"" but they contain no indication that the ""Guidelines"" in any way pertained to the prices 
charged by repair shops or used by Nationwide in writing estimates. State Farm Documents 988-99, Plaintiffs' App., vol. II.  
Another State Farm document discusses Allstate's system of ""drive-in"" garages, and states that the system has been discussed 
with Allstate's management.  The memorandum also states, however, that State Farm was opposed to adopting any 
arrangements similar to the system used by Allstate. State Farm Document 1026, Plaintiffs' App., vol. II.  Finally, appellants also 
cite a memorandum about a meeting between representatives of Travelers and Allstate that discusses part of Allstate's 
organizational structure and its training program for claims personnel.  The memorandum contains no discussion of automobile 
repair work or estimates. Travelers Document 79, Plaintiffs' App., vol. I."
702,56," .  Appellants also cite portions of the deposition of Al Spina, also an owner of a repair shop, to support the same allegation. 
Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 14 n.21.  As already noted, however, the Spina deposition is not in the record.  See note 40 supra."
702,57," .  It is a fact of economic life that a firm which is required to set a price higher than the market price in order to recover its 
various costs and return a reasonable profit to the owners may be ""in trouble."" Such firms often are inefficient in the economic 
sense, and the process of market competition-a process protected by the Sherman Act-requires that such firms either become 
more efficient or be driven out of business. "
703,58," .  Other portions of the Knotts deposition, not cited by appellants, indicate that when the repair shop's labor rate exceeded the 
rate used by the insurance company in writing the estimate, the company paid the shop's rate.  See Knotts Tr. at 16 (""If you got 
an estimate come in there, say, from State Farm that's $ 8 an hour, you inform them that we're at $ 9 an hour then they make 
the difference up.  In other words, they pay the $ 9."")."
703,59," .  In their earlier deposition testimony, appellants state that there was some variation in the labor rates used by appellees, 
generally a variation of one dollar an hour.  See Proctor Tr. at 127-128, 181, 780-81, Record, entry no. 288; Hogg Tr. at 665-66, 
704, Record, entry no. 291.  Their deposition testimony also indicates that appellants themselves set their hourly labor rates, 
taking into account factors such as their costs and the going rate among other repair shops in their area.  See Proctor Tr. at 744; 
Hogg Tr. at 702-03; Cumming Tr. at 251-52, Record, entry no. 289. "

705,61," .  See notes 45-46, 50-53 supra and accompanying text."
705,62," .  The District Court stated: In Proctor, there were no written agreements as in Royal Drug. These written agreements have no counterparts in the 
automobile insurance industry.  There was no demonstration that such agreements existed between insurers and the 
innumerable auto repair shops where insureds can and do go for repairs. There has been no showing that insureds offered to 
enter into such arrangements with ""preferred"" repair shops. The factual situation in Proctor is so completely different from that in 
Royal Drug that the finding in the latter should not be regarded as controlling. Proctor II, (1980-81) Trade Cases (CCH) P 63,591 at 77,140.  We do not find the District Court's distinctions persuasive.  
Indeed, the prior ruling of the Court of Appeals in Proctor, that the vertical arrangements constituted the ""business of insurance,"" 
was cited by the Supreme Court in Royal Drug as one of the conflicting circuit court decisions that provided the basis for the 
grant of certiorari in Royal Drug.  Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 208-09 n.2, 99 S. Ct. at 1071-72 n.2; see note 25 supra. "
707,63," .  It may be true that appellants had to lower their rates to the level charged by shops that had entered into agreements with 
one or more of the appellees or face the prospect of losing some of appellees' business to those shops. Appellants have not 
alleged, however, that appellees had any intentions of boycotting non-""preferred"" repair shops or that any of the appellees 
limited the number of ""preferred"" shops they used.  See Appellants' Brief at 33.  Although appellants may have had to lower their 
rates, this is an injury stemming from competition among repair shops to obtain business from automobile insurers. ""The antitrust 
laws, however, were enacted for ""the protection of competition, not competitors.' "" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.,

707,66," .  We also offer no opinion on whether a horizontal agreement to enter into vertical arrangements with ""captive"" repair shops 
would be immunized under the McCarran Act.  Appellants have not contended that the horizontal agreement they allege

712,22," .  The alleged practices in this case simply bear no relationship to the concerns underlying passage of the McCarran 
exemption. Those concerns centered on the inability of insurance companies, especially smaller ones, to underwrite risks 
accurately in the absence of cooperation.  Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 221, 99 S. Ct. at 1078. Yet we deal in this case with 
enormous insurance companies that did not even engage in the alleged price-fixing agreement until 1968 or 1969.  Brief for 
appellants at 5.  For over 20 years after passage of the exemption, insurance companies accurately underwrote risks without 
agreeing upon the labor rates of auto repair shops. Consequently, the challenged activities hardly amount to ""quintessential"" 
insurance functions.  Like the agreements in Royal Drug, the activities here are ""legally indistinguishable from countless other 
business arrangements that may be made by insurance companies to keep their costs low and thereby also keep low the level 
of premiums charged to their policyholders."" 440 U.S. at 215, 99 S. Ct. at 1075. While the horizontal agreements may be the 
business of insurance companies, they are definitely not the business of insurance."

721,3, See note 5 infra.
721,4," In its April 20, 1981, motion and brief defendants argued and have consistently maintained that this plea agreement bars 
prosecution of these five indictments. That contention's rejection does not require discussion. "
725,5," The indictment alleges that defendant Ashland-Warren set up a job at Byrd Field in Richmond.  The first information alleges 
that defendant allocated work in the Tidewater area of Virginia, described by the boundaries of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, 
Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Suffolk, Hampton, and Newport News.  The latter information alleges that Ashland-Warren allocated 
work in the Richmond District of the Virginia Department of Highways. This information is limited in time to a letting held on 
March 6, 1979.  The indictment in United States v. Blakemore Construction Corp., et al., Crim. No. 81-00067-R (E.D.Va. July 16, 
1981), which charges other defendants with the same conspiracy, refers to the ""Richmond area,"" which encompasses the area 
in and around the city of Richmond, including but not limited to the counties of Charles City, Chesterfield, Goochland, Hanover, 
Henrico, Louisa, New Kent, and Powhatan.  Government Exhibit 25.  Pursuant to Rule 201(b)(2), the Court takes judicial notice 
that the Richmond Highway District also included the counties of Prince George, Amelia, Nottoway, Dinwiddie, Lunenburg, 
Brunswick, and Mecklenburg.  This is shown by a map of Virginia's construction district locations in Defendants' Exhibit 228, pp. 
52-53.  Exhibit 228, a publication of the Virginia Asphalt Association, was marked for identification but not offered into evidence.  
The Court finds that this map is a source whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.  Defendants' Exhibit 30 is based on 
a map of Virginia, and shows that these counties lie in the southeastern quadrant of the state."
725,6," Defendants in the early stages of this litigation repeatedly insisted that the conspiracy covered the entire southeast.  Because 
they were required only to show a conspiracy covering Virginia and Tennessee, the Court excluded attempts to prove a 
conspiracy extending into other southeastern states. "
726,7," It would appear that the double jeopardy defense did not occur to defendants' counsel soon enough to be raised in the Virginia 
prosecutions."
726,8," There is no dispute that the protection of the HN3[
] double jeopardy clause applies to corporate defendants.  See United States v. Hospital Monteflores, Inc., 575 F.2d 332 (1st Cir. 1978)."
726,9," At this point there is no need to distinguish among the five Tennessee cases.  Defendants argue that each prosecution is 
barred for the same reason, and thus at this point the five indictments are better viewed conceptually as one.  Whether the five 
indictments actually allege but one conspiracy among themselves is discussed infra, at 447-448. "
727,10, The fifteen Virginia co-conspirators listed in Government Exhibit 73 and the fifty-six companies listed in Appendix A. 
728,11," Defendants' Exhibit 219, p. 10, shows that Pendleton, a co-conspirator in Case No. 81-30043, pulled a proposal for the March 
6, 1979, Richmond letting, which is the focus of the second Eastern Virginia information to which defendant pleaded guilty. "
730,12," LaFave & Scott discussed this case in the context of ""wheel"" conspiracies. The Court has made no attempt to define the 
conspiracies at issue as ""wheel"" or ""chain"" type conspiracies, characterizations which have been discarded by modern courts.  
See United States v. Perez, 489 F.2d 51 (5th Cir. 1973); Note, supra, 42 Brooklyn L.Rev. at 307. "
732,13," As previously discussed, the Court has concluded that Consolidated Packaging is completely distinguishable in regard to 
defendants' attempt to draw Eastern Virginia bidriggers into the same conspiracies set forth in these indictments, because 
Eastern Virginia highway pavers are not in competition with the co-conspirators in these cases.  By contrast, the co-conspirators 
in the Tennessee cases were often competitors among themselves in the Tennessee highway paving market, although it cannot 
be said that each of the fifty-six companies was in competition with all the others on each job. "
733,14," See Klein, Conspiracy-The Prosecutor's Darling, 24 Brooklyn L.Rev. 1 (1957)."
733,15," The Court severed the individual defendants Vann and Melhorn in Case No. 81-30043 so that their testimony might be 
presented on the double jeopardy issue after their trial, which commences on March 22, 1982.  Although the Court has serious 
doubts that their testimony will connect 81-30043 with the convictions in Eastern Virginia, defendants will be allowed to put on 
Vann and Melhorn before any trial on that indictment. The Court has previously stated its intention to try 81-30043 last, in the 
event there are multiple trials.  Transcript at 808. "
775,*," The Honorable Robert A. Grant, United States Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation. "
776,1, This license requires that all copies must be destroyed after they have been used.
776,2," Since 1979 F.E.L. has offered an annual per song license allowing copying in unlimited quantities for one year at a rate of $ 
25.00 for the first song and $ 15.00 for each additional song. Because this license was only offered after November 1979, it is 
not pertinent to this lawsuit."
776,3," The 1909 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  §§ 1 et seq., has been replaced by the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  §§ 101 et seq. 
Unless otherwise stated, all citations to the Copyright Act refer to the 1909 Act."

777,6, See 17 U.S.C.  § 104. 
778,7," See 17 U.S.C.  § 27; Platt & Munk Co. v. Republic Graphics, Inc., 315 F.2d 847 (2d Cir. 1963)."
778,8," F.E.L. contends that section 104 of the 1909 Copyright Act does not exempt performances by church congregations and there 
is some doubt as to whether these performances are indeed exempt under the Act.  Thus, clause 4 of the ACL was inserted to 
inform parishes that they did have the right to perform music at masses.  Section 104 provides in part: HN6[
] That nothing in this title shall be so construed as to prevent the performance of religious or secular works such as 
oratories, cantatas, masses, or octavo choruses by public schools, church choirs, or vocal societies, rented, borrowed, or 
obtained from some public library, public school, church choir, school choir, or vocal society, provided the performance is given 
for charitable or educational purposes and not for profit. "
779,," Despite the fact that church congregations are not exempted by section 104, not-for-profit performances at masses are clearly 
exempt under section 1(e).  This does not render section 104 superfluous.  This section probably refers to those situations 
where, for example, a church choir charges a fee for a performance and donates the proceeds to a charitable cause.  Any 
contention that performances by congregations might not be exempted does not stand up in the face of this analysis.  
Regardless, we do not believe that F.E.L. needs any excuse for clause 4 because no fee was enacted by the ACL for the right to 
perform."
779,9," Clause 6 of the ACL requires users to include composer and music copyright acknowledgments even where the words alone 
are copied.  Conceivably, this could result in a situation where a copyright notice for the music is printed and the words are in the 
public domain (some of F.E.L.'s songs contain words which are in the public domain).  The district court believed that this was 
further evidence of F.E.L's attempt to license not-for-profit performances.  We have already determined that the ACL does not 
license exempt performances and this clause does not persuade us otherwise.  However, it is copyright misuse to exact a fee for 
the use of a musical work which is already in the public domain. Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661 
(1944). The question in this case is whether F.E.L. has extended its copyright beyond the strict boundaries of the conferring 
statute.  Id. at 665. The ACL charges a flat fee regardless of what is actually copied; there is no evidence that F.E.L. exacted a 
fee for words in the public domain. While F.E.L. could not legally compel parishes to put a copyright for musical notes on words 
in the public domain, this is not a sufficient basis for a finding of copyright misuse.  Even if this were misuse, it would not require 
dismissal of the copyright claim in the instant case in light of the Bishop's infringements of F.E.L.'s copyrights.  Dismissal of a 
copyright claim for misuse is an equitable defense which requires a balancing of equities.  We think that in this case, the scales 
are tipped in F.E.L.'s favor."
779,10," Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra, 441 U.S. at 20. "
780,11," The Sherman Act has always been discriminatingly applied in the light of economic realities.  Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. at 14, 
citing Amicus Curiae on Petition for Certiorari in K-91, Inc. v. Gershwin, O.T. 1967, No. 147, p. 10.  A musical copyright is 
worthless unless an owner has a means of enforcing the legal rights guaranteed by the Act.  One means of protecting these 
rights is a license such as the ACL.  The ACL takes into account the great number of churches across the land, the sheer 
volume of copyrighted compositions, the impracticability of negotiating individual licenses and the ephemeral nature of a 
publication by a church (i.e., distribution of songs to the congregation).  The ACL also sufficiently provides for the needs and 
desires of churches to produce custom-made hymnals."
780,12," Broadcast Music, Inc., supra, 441 U.S. at 19."
780,13, Id. at 21.
780,14," The ACL may be compared to a songbook or hymnal where all the songs are sold together even though some are more 
popular than others.  A publisher selling a hymnal is not guilty of violating the antitrust laws because he does not offer for sale 
each song separately.  A contrary holding would not only be uneconomical and inconvenient but would reduce the availability of 
copyrighted works."
780,15," Though not crucial to the holding in Broadcast Music, the Supreme Court did note that there were no ""legal, practical or 
conspiratorial impediments to… obtaining individual licenses."" 441 U.S. at 24. The licensor held non-exclusive rights in the 
copyrighted songs and nothing prevented a television network from dealing directly with the copyright owners.  In the instant 
case, the district court concluded that because F.E.L. owned all the copyrights to its 1,400 song inventory (unlike Broadcast 
Music ), there was no alternative to the ACL which allowed churches to produce custom-made hymnals and that this was a per 
se violation of the Sherman Act. We do not agree with this reasoning.  Even if Broadcast Music mandated alternatives, the "
781,," record in this case discloses available alternatives to the ACL which allow the purchase or copying of individual songs. These 
alternatives do not allow parishes to produce custom-made hymnals, but this does not render the ACL illegal per se.  If the 
district court's conclusions are accepted, this would make the mere offering of a blanket license a per se violation of the 
Sherman Act and this is contrary to the result reached in Broadcast Music. "
782,16," If we limit the relevant market to copy licenses or perhaps even copy licenses which allow for permanent custom-made 
hymnals, we could conceivably limit the availability of liturgical music. By eliminating a publisher's alternative-marketing devices 
from consideration under the antitrust laws, we force the license at issue to stand alone as a competitive or anti-competitive 
agreement.  Given this result, a publisher may choose to withdraw a copy license altogether, rather than increase the number of 
alternative copy licenses. This result is not mandated by the Sherman Act and is certainly not the best way to ""promote the 
progress of the useful art."" United States Constitution, Art. I § 8."
782,17," It is conceivable that the ACL would not violate the Sherman Act even without a realistic alternative marketing mechanism.  
See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 50 U.S.L.W. 2370 (Nov. 24, 1981) (No. 1043 ATRR A-13)."

782,19," See James Burrough, Ltd. v. Sign of the Beefeater, Inc., 540 F.2d 266, 274 (7th Cir. 1976) (trademark infringement under the 
Lanham Act is found when evidence indicates confusion on the part of the public); Boston Professional Hockey Assoc., Inc. v. 
Dallas Cap & Emblem Mfg. Co., 510 F.2d 1004, 1010 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 868 (1975) (generally, the same facts 
which support an action for trademark infringement support an action for unfair competition). "
783,20," F.E.L. filed a motion to supplement the record in this court with a document entitled ""FDLC Update of Music Publishers' 
Reprint Permissions Policies"" (the ""FDLC Update"").  The district court denied this motion on April 17, 1981.  On May 29 this 
court granted the motion to supplement.  The Bishop did not receive notice of F.E.L.'s motion to supplement the record and, 
upon receipt of this court's order, moved to vacate it and deny the motion on June 4, 1981.  On June 16 this court ordered that 
the motion to vacate be referred to the panel to be taken with with the case at the time of oral argument. The FDLC Update was not before the district court when it ruled on defendant's motion for summary judgment. Rule 10(e), 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, ""does not give this court authority to admit on appeal any document which was not 
made a part of the record in the District Court."" Borden, Inc. v. FTC, 495 F.2d 785, 788 (7th Cir. 1974). The Bishop's ""Motion to 
Vacate Order Granting [F.E.L.'s] Motion to Supplement the Record on Appeal"" is granted. "
790,1," .  On August 14, 1981, before disposition of these motions, Garritano moved to substitute counsel. Her affidavit cited 
""irreconcilable differences"" with Van Schaick's attorney, who had been acting as her counsel as well. We allowed that motion on 
August 21, 1981. "
791,2," .  Plaintiff has not served the individual defendants, L. Ron Hubbard and Mary Sue Hubbard."
791,3," .  Auditing is a process during which a Scientology employee or agent (Auditor) uses a set of questions and drills, in conjunction 
with a mechanical device similar to a lie detector (the Hubbard E-meter) to elicit personal information from the subject, for the 
alleged purpose of psychotherapy. In order to obtain auditing, the subject signs a contract with the Church. The auditor asks 
questions which locate ""Buttons""-a conscious or subconscious indication or response. To help locate ""buttons"", the auditor uses "
792,," a Hubbard E-meter, a device which measures skin voltage. During auditing, the auditor pursues lines of questioning on highly 
personal subjects (""rundowns"") to locate the subject's ""buttons"". The auditor then makes a written record of the disclosures 
made."
792,4," .  Plaintiff alleges that it is Church policy to harass ex-members, and that this policy is explicitly authorized in the ""Fair Game 
Doctrine"" which states, inter alia: ""Every S. P. (Suppressive Person) Order Fair Game. May be deprived or injured by any means by any Scientologist. May be 
tricked, sued, or destroyed."" For purposes of the pending motions, we ignore defense counsel's representation at oral argument that the Fair Game Doctrine 
had been misconstrued and was repealed in 1968. "
793,5," .  Since the Fair Labor Standards Act does not contain a special venue provision, the general venue statute controls actions 
under the Act.  Goldberg v. Wharf Constructers, N.D.Ala., 1962, 209 F. Supp. 499, 501. "
794,6," .  The special venue provision found in 18 U.S.C. § 1965 is not intended to be exclusive, but is intended to liberalize the existing 
venue provisions. Therefore, HN4[
] where venue is improper under § 1965(a), it is appropriate to inquire whether the action can be maintained under the general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Farmers Bank of State of Del. v. Bell Mortg. Corp., 
D.Del., 1978, 452 F. Supp. 1278, 1280-1281. Section 1391(b) provides that venue is proper where the cause of action arose. 
But since almost all of the acts upon which plaintiff's RICO counts are predicated occurred outside of Massachusetts, none of 
her RICO claims ""arose"" in this district."
794,7," .  The California Church argues that even if its own business activities here are sufficiently extensive to meet the venue 
requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c), venue for the entire action is still improper in this district because the venue requirements 
of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) have not been met with respect to the individual defendants. But the defense of improper venue is 
personal to the party to whom it applies, and a resident defendant may not avail himself of a dismissal or transfer due to 
improper venue over a nonresident, unless the latter is an indispensable party.  Camp v. Gress, 1919, 250 U.S. 308, 316, 39 S. 
Ct. 478, 481, 63 L. Ed. 997; Vance Trucking Co. v. Canal Insurance Co., 4 Cir., 1964, 338 F.2d 943, 944; Goldberg v. Wharf 
Constructers, N.D.Ala., 1962, 209 F. Supp. 499, 503-504."
794,8," .  Although defendants have not addressed themselves to plaintiff's second amended complaint, we assume, based on 
defendants' briefs and oral argument, that they would raise the same objections to plaintiff's most recent pleading. "
795,9," .   HN8[
] 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) states: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any 
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."
795,10," .  Plaintiff's complaint itself fails to specify which subsection of § 1962 defendants are alleged to have violated; however, the 
memoranda of law filed subsequently have made it clear that she predicates her claim on § 1962(c). "
797,11," .  Judge Duffy's opinion in Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. O'Hearn, supra, is not to the contrary. He rejected as ""specious"" the argument 
that a company that had paid allegedly reasonable prices, though ones inflated by bribes and kickbacks, had not suffered an 
injury which § 1964(c) addresses since it was ""not hurt competitively by the RICO violation."" Ibid. at 248. We subscribe to Judge 
Duffy's conclusion that a RICO violation does not depend upon the existence of a competitive injury. Although antitrust law 
proscribes and remedies certain injuries to competition, RICO does not so directly seek to protect competition. As Judge 
Churchill observed, ""competitive injuries and racketeering enterprise injuries would frequently overlap, but they are not 
necessarily the same."" Landmark Savings v. Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Co., supra. Section 1964(c) does not require a 
""competitive injury"" but rather, in part, a ""racketeering enterprise injury"" and a plaintiff who has experienced commercial harm 
resulting from it."
797,12," .  We do not reach defendants' contention that civil liability under § 1962(c) and § 1964(c) must be preceded by prior criminal 
convictions of two criminal acts, except to note that the opposing citations relied on by plaintiff, United States v. Malatesta, 5 Cir. 
1978, 583 F.2d 748, cert. den., 1979, 440 U.S. 962, 99 S. Ct. 1508, 59 L. Ed. 2d 777, and United States v. Frumento, 3 Cir. 
1977, 563 F.2d 1083, cert. den., 1978, 434 U.S. 1072, 98 S. Ct. 1256, 55 L. Ed. 2d 775, are distinguishable in their factual 
situations and holdings. While it is difficult for us to conclude that Congress, in using the words ""indictable"" and ""punishable"" 
contemplated that civil liability could result without involvement of the criminal process, other courts have done so. "
798,13, .  Plaintiff's complaint does not contain a paragraph 47.
798,14," .  For the reasons stated above, we dismiss plaintiff's three RICO counts for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted. Since plaintiff predicates her class action on one or more of these RICO counts, our ruling eliminates the class claims 
from this case. "
800,15," .  The extent to which the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to religious organizations is unclear. Although the Seventh Circuit 
did hold that the FLSA covered employees of a church corporation who worked in a church-owned printing establishment, 
Mitchell v. Pilgrim Holiness Church Corp., 7 Cir. 1954, 210 F.2d 879, cert. den. 1954, 347 U.S. 1013, 74 S. Ct. 867, 98 L. Ed. 
1136, the Supreme Court has not addressed this issue and the legislative history and regulations suggest that religious activities 
of non-profit organizations were to be exempt. "
802,16," .  We do not construe Ballard to hold that, although courts may not examine the truth or falsity of statements of a religious 
nature, these statements may be the bases of a fraud action if made in bad faith. The Court in Ballard never addressed that 
issue. Rather, it held only that the verity of religious beliefs or doctrines should not be submitted to the jury."
802,17," .  In International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, the Second Circuit held that, absent a showing that no less 
restrictive alternative existed which would not have interfered with the Krishna ritual of ""sankirtan"", the practice by which those 
devoted to Krishna approach non-members, tell them of their religion's tenets and seek contributions, a regulation restricting 
solicitation at a state fair to a booth unconstitutionally interfered with free exercise rights of members of Krishna Consciousness. In Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, supra, the Supreme Court upheld a similar regulation restricting 
solicitation at the Minnesota State Fair as a reasonable time, place and manner restriction on First Amendment rights. The Court 
reached that decision through a different analysis than that employed by the Second Circuit and one which did not involve an 
inquiry regarding whether Krishna Consciousness had religious aspects entitling it to the protection of the First Amendment. 
Judge Kaufman's opinion for the Second Circuit is cited here not for its holding, which the Supreme Court rejected in Heffron, but 
for whatever light it sheds on the separate problem regarding the criteria a court uses to determine when the protection of the 
Free Exercise clause is properly invoked. "
806,*," Honorable Homer Thornberry, U. S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
807,1," Kypta and his co-plaintiff, Vincent Bottino, charged McDonald's with violating section four of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, 
and section one of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. The complaint was amended twice, charging additional violations of federal 
securities law.  Mr. Bottino, who subsequently settled his claims against McDonald's, has withdrawn from the case."
807,2," Because we uphold the trial court's granting of summary judgment as to the real estate tie-in claim, we necessarily affirm the 
denial of class certification regarding the same claim, without having to address its merits. "
808,3," Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, which has been amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), prohibits 
anticompetitive price discrimination. "
815,*," Hon. C. A. Muecke, Chief United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation. "
816,1," This is the second case before this court involving the same course of events.  The plaintiff in Arnold v. International Business 
Machines Corp., 637 F.2d 1350 (9th Cir. 1981), was one of the persons implicated in the theft of IBM secrets.  He brought an 
action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985, on the theory that IBM violated his civil rights by giving false and misleading 
information to the San Jose Police that resulted in the search of his residence and in his arrest and subsequent indictment. We there affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to IBM because the plaintiff failed to show that IBM was the 
proximate cause of the search, arrest, and indictment. On the record of that case, we found no facts that indicated that IBM 
ultimately controlled the decisions of the police, and therefore IBM's actions could not be said to be the legal cause of the police 
actions that injured plaintiff. "
819,2," The California Court of Appeal explained this distinction as follows: Generally speaking, there is no doubt that when the operation of a business is interrupted by wrongful acts, damages, whether 
of prospective profits or otherwise, should be ascertained with reasonable certainty from the past volume of business and other 
provable data, generally of a mathematical nature, relevant to what the profits were and what profit probabilities would have 
been or would be if the wrongful act had not been perpetrated. It is also true, however, that ""(t)his rule does not apply to uncertainty as to the amount of the profits which would have been 
derived, but to uncertainty or speculation as to whether the loss of profits was the result of the wrong and whether any such 
profits would have been derived at all."" …. A wrongdoer should not escape liability for his wrong because damages cannot be measured with exactness. Under the circumstances herein delineated, it is for the trier of fact to use the evidence available in assessing damages.  ""It is 
axiomatic that where substantial compensable injury is shown but the amount of the damage cannot be ascertained with 
reasonable certainty …, the question rests in the sound judgment and discretion of the trier of fact."" Drouet v. Moulton, 245 Cal.App.2d 667, 54 Cal.Rptr. 278, 281-82 (1966) (emphasis supplied in part) (citations omitted)."
819,3," The trial court's instruction on IBM's justification defense was as follows: Instruction Number 43 In addition to denying any wrongful or intentional interference with any prospective business advantage of the plaintiff, the 
defendant raises the defense that its conduct was justified under all of the circumstances shown by the evidence in the case. "
820,," The defendant has the burden of proof on this defense of justification.  If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendant was justified in the acts of which the plaintiff complains, then you should find for the defendant and against the plaintiff 
on the claim of intentional interference with plaintiff's prospective business advantage. The defendant claims by way of justification that it was motivated by its desire to protect its trade secrets or proprietary 
information.  Further, IBM claims justification based on the social duty of good citizens to aid in proper enforcement of the 
criminal laws. I instruct you that a party has a right to take reasonable steps to protect its trade secrets and proprietary information from 
improper use by unauthorized persons. I also instruct you that there is a strong public policy to encourage all citizens to assist law enforcement agencies by reporting 
criminal activities, and by cooperating with the duly authorized civil authorities in carrying out the law enforcement duties 
assigned to such authorities."
820,4," California recognizes justification as an affirmative defense to the torts of interference with a contractual relationship and 
interference with prospective advantage.  The defense was explained by the California Supreme Court as follows: Whether an intentional interference by a third party is justifiable depends upon a balancing of the importance, social and private, 
of the objective advanced by the interference against the importance of the interest interfered with, considering all circumstances 
including the nature of the actor's conduct and the relationship between the parties. Herron v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 56 Cal.2d 202, 206-07, 363 P.2d 310, 312, 14 Cal.Rptr. 294, 296 (1961). See also Lowell v. 
Mother's Cake & Cookie Co., 79 Cal.App.3d 13, 18, 144 Cal.Rptr. 664, 667-68 (1978); A. F. Arnold & Co., v. Pac. Professional 
Ins., Inc., 27 Cal.App.3d 710, 713-16, 104 Cal.Rptr. 96, 98-100 (1972)."
820,5," We have found no California case directly in point on the question of whether a private citizen may be subjected to civil liability 
when, at a peace officer's request, he aids the officer in conducting a search.  Therefore, we must derive from a review of 
relevant California law the result the California Supreme Court would reach if presented with this case.  Scandinavian Airline 
System v. United Aircraft Corp., 601 F.2d 425, 427 (9th Cir. 1979). "
821,6," In the intentional tort context, a privilege may be either ""absolute"" or ""qualified."" Conduct that is absolutely privileged may not 
be a predicate for liability regardless of the motive or purpose of the actor.  A qualified privilege, however, in general only "
822,," protects the actor where he can show that he acted reasonably and with proper motive.  See W. Prosser, Law of Torts § 16 at 
98-99 (4th ed. 1971)."
822,7," The courts in Bledsoe and Scott sustained demurrers to the complaint and the court in Brody upheld a directed verdict for 
defendant.  The practical effect of this application of the justification defense is to accord immunity coextensive with and 
indistinguishable from the absolute privilege provided by section 47(2)."
822,8," In Bradley, the plaintiff based a defamation claim on allegedly libelous statements contained in documents filed in a personal 
injury action.  The trial court found the statements to be absolutely privileged under section 47(2) and dismissed the claim.  The 
California Court of Appeal reversed, finding that the documents had been filed for the sole purpose of having the defamations 
republished by the news media.  Because the publication was not made to achieve the objects of the litigation and promote the 
interests of justice, the court refused to afford the slanderer the protection of the statutory privilege.  30 Cal.App.3d at 826, 106 
Cal.Rptr. at 723-24."
822,9," IBM explains that its expressed aim to create a ""thunderclap"" of publicity reflected the hope of some IBM security officials that 
the publicity attending criminal prosecutions would have a deterrent effect on trafficking in its trade secrets. Forro, on the other 
hand, says the desired effect was to discredit Forro in the eyes of its customers. "
826,10," Other courts have reasoned that the scope of immunity depends on the degree of political discretion exercised by the 
government agency.  Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 144 U.S. App. D.C. 56, 444 F.2d 931, 941-42 (D.C.Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 
U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972); Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 
F.2d 1286, 1296-98 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972). We agree that claimed 
abuses of government processes should receive more intense scrutiny outside the area of legislative activity.  See also Rodgers 
v. FTC, 492 F.2d 228, 232 n.3 (9th Cir. 1974) (dictum); Israel v. Baxter Laboratories, Inc., 151 U.S. App. D.C. 101, 466 F.2d 272, 
275-80 (D.C.Cir.1972); Semke v. Enid Automobile Dealers Ass'n, 456 F.2d 1361, 1366-67 (10th Cir. 1972); Outboard Marine 
Corp. v. Pezetel, 474 F. Supp. 168, 176-78 (D.Del.1979); Marketing Assistance Plan, Inc. v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc.,

827,11," The trial court's general instruction on the misappropriation claim was as follows: Instruction Number 44 The defendant makes a counterclaim for damages against the plaintiff, claiming that the plaintiff misappropriated trade secret 
information that belonged to the defendant. To prevail on such a claim against the plaintiff, the defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence in the case, 
each of the following essential elements: FIRST: That the information involved constituted trade secret information, and was so treated by the defendant; SECOND: That the plaintiff improperly came into possession of defendant's trade secret information; THIRD: That plaintiff used the trade secret information in the conduct of its business; and FOURTH: That as a proximate result of plaintiff's use of defendant's trade secret information, plaintiff was unjustly enriched."
827,12," The trial court's instructions on the intentional interference claim are in relevant part as follows: Instruction Number 37 Plaintiff also makes a claim that the defendant IBM intentionally interfered with the plaintiff's prospective business advantages. To prevail on this claim, the plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence in the case, each of the following essential 
elements: FIRST: That an economic relationship existed between the plaintiff and its customers, containing the probability of future 
economic benefit to the plaintiff; SECOND: That the defendant knew of the existence of the relationship; THIRD: That there were intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship; FOURTH: That there was an actual disruption of the relationship; and FIFTH: That the defendant's acts proximately resulted in damage to the plaintiff's business. Instruction Number 40 The third element of a claim of intentional interference with prospective business advantage is that the defendant had the 
specific intent to disrupt the economic relationship.  That is, you must find that, with knowledge of the plaintiff's economic 
relationships, the defendant took specific action which was taken for the purpose of harming those relationships. It is not sufficient, in order to establish specific intent, for you to find that the defendant had knowledge of the relationship, and 
that the defendant took an act which had some effect upon that relationship.  Instead, you must find that the act or action was so 
taken with the intent of adversely affecting the plaintiff's economic relationship."

829,*," FORMER FIFTH CIRCUIT CASE, SECTION 9(1) OF PUBLIC LAW 96-452-OCTOBER 14, 1980. "
831,**," Judge Gewin was a member of the panel that heard oral argument in this case and participated in the consideration of the 
case, but his death occurred before the case was decided. "
832,1," The appellees include Buena Vista Distribution Co., Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 
Paramount Pictures Corp., United Artists Corp., Universal Film Exchanges, Inc., Warner Brothers Distributing Corp., Georgia 
Theatre Co., Storey Theatres, Inc., Weis-Theatres, Inc., and Capri-Fine Arts Theatres, Inc."
832,2," The portion of this opinion which discusses the factual background of the case is taken almost verbatim from the district court's 
order of June 30, 1980, in which the court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by United Artists but denied the 
motions filed by the other defendants.  On July 31, 1980, on a motion for reconsideration, summary judgment was entered in 
favor of all named defendants. "
834,3," A successful bidder may have obtained a promise from the distributor not to license the same film to other nearby theatres 
concurrent with, or subsequent to, its run at the bidder's theatre. This arrangement is known as a clearance. The owner of a 
theatre that was cleared by a successful bidder will not be invited to join in negotiations."
834,4," Fox was the first distributor to accept bids from Southway.  It allowed Southway to bid for first non-exclusive and intermediate 
runs in July 1974.  Buena Vista began accepting bids for first and intermediate runs in April 1975.  Columbia began to include "
835,," Southway in bidding for intermediate runs in April 1975 and for first runs in November 1975.  Universal permitted Southway to 
bid for first and intermediate runs in May 1975.  Paramount added Southway to its lists for first non-exclusive and intermediate 
runs in May 1975, and for first exclusive runs in the spring of 1976.  Warner allowed Southway to bid for first unrestricted runs 
and intermediate runs in the summer of 1975.  It did not send bid solicitations to Southway, however, until October 1975 for 
intermediate runs, and for the fall of 1976 for first unrestricted runs. "
836,5," When describing boycotts, the court observed that such concerted activity is per se violative of the Sherman Act. Whether that 
is always true is not a question before this court because it was not raised by the parties.  Moreover, the district court was not 
presented with the question.  None of the defendants raised the issue by asserting any justification for the anti-competitive 
conduct which Southway alleged; instead they simply denied the existence of a boycott. In approving the district court's analysis, 
then, we are not deciding when the per se rule applies to a boycott case and when it does not.  This question, which has 
become more troublesome after Broadcast Music v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 441 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 
(1979) (holding that the price-fixing allegation there should be assessed under the rule of reason), must be saved for a later day."
836,6," The refusal to deal which would be involved under either theory would constitute a boycott. ""HN1[
] It does not matter how 
the end is achieved, if one or more firms is deprived of suppliers or customers (or other essential trade relationships) by 
concerted action among other firms aimed at keeping the victim firms from competing, the arrangement is in purpose and effect 
a boycott."" L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 231 (1977)."
836,7," The district court indicated that the doctrine of conscious parallelism is largely insufficient for the task of showing a boycott 
conspiracy indirectly.  See Appendix at 501.  We agree that parallelism demonstrates little when a refusal to deal is the wrong "
837,," complained of, but we believe that this means only that courts must demand more from the evidence of circumstances 
surrounding such a refusal."
837,8," In the course of discovery, Southway obtained one letter-sent from a circuit theatre to a distributor-which may suggest the 
existence of some type of exclusionary practice and which was labeled ""direct evidence"" in the district court proceedings.  
However, it does not explicitly refer to an understanding between exhibitors and distributors, and its implicates only one exhibitor 
and one distributor. Because one must still infer a conspiracy from the letter, the letter is circumstantial evidence as to the 
alleged boycott."
837,9," The language used by the district court may suggest that the motion picture antitrust cases may receive special treatment by 
the courts.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 makes no such distinction though.  Summary judgment procedures pursuant to the rule must apply 
equally to all actions.  Aladdin Oil Company v. Texaco, Inc., 603 F.2d 1107, 1110-12 (5th Cir. 1979). "
838,10," The complete statement of law has been articulated by the Third Circuit in this manner: HN5[
] ""(P)roof of consciously 
parallel business behavior is circumstantial evidence from which an agreement, tacit or expressed, can be inferred but … such 
evidence, without more, is insufficient unless the circumstances under which it occurred make the inference of rational, 
independent choice less attractive than that of concerted action."" Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 561 F.2d 434, 436 (3d Cir. 
1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978). See generally Ambook Enterprises v. Time, Inc., 
612 F.2d 604, 613-15 (2d Cir. 1979). 2 P. Areeda and D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 317 at 83 (1978)."
838,11," In some situations where a conspiracy is alleged, but not here, the behavior of the defendants may necessarily be 
interdependent.  See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 222, 59 S. Ct. 467, 472, 83 L. Ed. 610 
(1939)(""Without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory there is a risk of a 
substantial loss of the business and good will of the subsequent run and independent exhibitors, but … with it there was the 
prospect of increased profits."").  Even in such a case, there may be some question concerning the relationship of 
interdependence and collusion.  See Posner, Oligopoly and the Antitrust Laws: A Suggested Approach, 21 Stan.L.Rev. 1562 
(1969); L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 122 (1977). "
839,12," Citing Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1410, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 
(1962), the appellant also contends that the district court's methodology involved improper compartmentalization of its proof.  
Since the proper application on remand of the summary judgment standard we have outlined will eliminate any 
compartmentalization problem that may have existed, it is unnecessary for us to deal fully with this contention.  However, we do 
emphasize that while the district court must analyze each piece of evidence, the question on summary judgment is whether a 
reasonable inference of conspiracy is raised from all the evidence viewed as a whole."
839,13, See note 8 supra.
839,14," But see, e.g., Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas Theatre Co., 585 F.2d 877, 886-87 (8th Cir., 1978) (affirming directed verdict 
for defendants); Dahl, Inc. v. Roy Cooper Co., 448 F.2d 17, 20 (9th Cir. 1977). "
840,15," This appendix represents a major portion of the district court's characterization and analysis of the antitrust issues in this 
case.  All original footnotes have been retained but have been renumbered (i, ii, iii, etc.). "
844,," i Professor Sullivan suggests that the legality of exclusive franchises also be decided based on whether substitutes are readily 
available to the excluded trader.  This test may be superior to an inquiry into effect on competition: the evil of a boycott, at least 
after Klors, does not depend on an actual detriment to competition, but derives from the unfairness of the arrangement and its 
effect on access to the marketplace.  An exclusive dealing arrangement could contain such undesirable characteristics even 
though, like a Klors boycott, it did not diminish competition.  In this case, however, the distinction would not be particularly 
meaningful.  A conspiracy between a single exhibitor and a single distributor would not only leave competition undiminished, but 
would also preserve an adequate alternative pool of distributors for Southway. ii By replacements, we mean non-conspiring distributors who were willing to consider bids from Southway on their merits, even if 
those distributors did not actually award licenses to Southway. "
846,," iii A distributor may be unlike a typical supplier of goods to retailers, in that the former's return is linked to the profits of its 
purchaser.  Most manufacturers or wholesalers receive a per-unit profit on the goods they sell.  Their interest usually lies in 
lowering retail prices and thereby boosting retail volume at the expense of the retailers's per-unit profit.  The film distributor, 
however, generally receives a percentage of each exhibitor's take.  By lessening the number of competing theatres it can grant 
each a limited territorial monopoly or at least diminish price competition among theatres showing the same film. The distributor 
can directly benefit from the higher box office gross that this diminution in competition produces. iv Similarly, we find no evidence in the record to sustain a charge of joint market allocation.  Southway seeks to apply that 
characterization to what it believes was a conspiracy among distributors not to treat Clayton County as a separate distribution 
area, entitled to first run films contemporaneously with Atlanta.  We need not determine whether such a decision, if jointly taken, 
would violate the antitrust laws, since we find no indication of such concerted decisionmaking.  Moreover, nothing in the record 
suggests that either (1) requiring Clayton County theatres to bid against Atlanta theatres for first run films or (2) licensing films in 
Clayton County only after they had played in Atlanta would have been contrary to the best business interests of any individual 
distributor. "
847,," v The courts' relatively lenient attitude toward clearances may be due in part to the likelihood that distributors have both the 
motive and, through the licensing process, the power to accomplish the same end unilaterally.  (Cross reference omitted.) To 
this extent, the existence of an agreement with an exhibitor is irrelevant. A determination of the number of participating distributors needed to transform an exclusive dealing arrangement into a boycott 
should seek consistency with the rule on unreasonable clearances. Both look ultimately to the degree to which supply is reduced 
in assessing the legality of an agreement to exclude. "
848,*," FORMER FIFTH CIRCUIT CASE, SECTION 9(1) OF PUBLIC LAW 96-452-OCTOBER 14, 1980. "
852,**," Honorable Charles R. Scott, U. S. District Court Judge for the Middle District of Florida, sitting by designation."
852,1," For further elaboration of the facts regarding the role of the rate bureaus, their relationship with the state regulatory 
commissions, and the general pattern of regulatory procedures in the five subject states, see the district court's carefully written 
opinion.  United States v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 471, 476-78 (N.D.Ga.1979)."
852,2," In the district court, the state attorneys general of the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee 
participated as amici curiae.  The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) also was allowed to 
participate as an intervenor. "
853,3," In asserting that there is a state compulsion requirement, we do not mean to suggest that private parties may have no role in 
proposing mandatory state action. In Parker and New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. 
Ed. 2d 361 (1979), the Supreme Court has made clear that HN2[
] an action may still be compelled by the state even though 
private parties petitioned for the state to consider requiring such action.  See also California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking 
Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 
L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); but cf.  Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 594 & n.31, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976) 
(action not required by state even though required by state commission tariff if action proposed by private party and tariff applies 
only to that party, not to parties statewide).  Once a state has adopted some policy, however, whether or not after a petition by a 
private party, private parties will be exempt from the antitrust laws only if the state requires some action pursuant to that policy. "
854,4," The Court noted that it might find liability against a private party required to perform some action even if there was no clear 
state policy favoring the action if so finding would be unfair to the party, 428 U.S. at 594-95, 96 S. Ct. at 3119, and that it might 
not in all circumstances find that state policy concerns preempted federal antitrust law.  Id. at 595, 96 S. Ct. at 3119. These 
concerns, however, arise only if the threshold state compulsion requirement is met.  We find, in any event, no unfairness in this 
case in holding appellants to be in violation of the Sherman Act, see text at note 22, infra, and no state policy here strong 
enough to justify preempting federal antitrust law.  See note 12, infra."
854,5," Neither in its brief nor at oral argument did the government take the position that the state regulatory commissions do not 
actively supervise the proposed collectively formulated rates through hearings to review the reasonableness of proposed tariffs. 
Moreover, the record evidence that the commissions routinely suspend the effectiveness of proposed tariffs and conduct 
hearings satisfies us that the second prong of the Midcal test has been met."
854,6," The Supreme Court, in a recent discussion of whether municipal action is state action exempt from antitrust oversight, has 
seemed to confirm that it views its decisions on state immunity as a continuum, rather than as establishing different standards 
before and after Midcal.  See Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 848, 70 L. Ed. 2d "
855,810," (1982). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit recently has used the state compulsion requirement of Goldfarb in the context of applying 
the Midcal standards.  Ronwin v. State Bar of Arizona, 663 F.2d 914, 918 (1981)."
855,7," In a footnote immediately following the articulation of its two-pronged standard in Midcal, the Supreme Court cited Note, Parker 
v. Brown Revisited: The State Action Doctrine After Goldfarb, Cantor, and Bates, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 898, 916 (1977), apparently 
as an example of the application of its standard.  445 U.S. at 105 n.8, 100 S. Ct. at 943 n.8. That Note, at the cited page, states 
that ""(t)he mere fact that anticompetitive conduct by a private party effectuates a clearly articulated state regulatory policy is not 
in itself sufficient to justify a state action defense….  The defense is only available if the state has elected to effectuate its policy 
by requiring the private conduct under attack"" (emphasis in original).  The Court's citation to the Note is a testament to the 
continued vitality of the state compulsion requirement. In footnote 8 the Court also cited Norman's on the Waterfront, Inc. v. Wheatley, 444 F.2d 1011, 1018 (3d Cir. 1971), and 
Asheville Tobacco Bd. v. FTC, 263 F.2d 502, 509-10 (4th Cir. 1959). Norman's found a mandatory filing program insufficient 
alone for there to be state action immunity. In Asheville, the Court noted both the absence of required state action and of state 
supervision. Neither case is inconsistent with, and both implicitly support, a state compulsion requirement in certain 
circumstances."
855,8," The dissent reasons that Midcal eliminates the state compulsion requirement because the basis for state compulsion is the 
concern that the economic self-interest of the companies might affect the rate setting process.  According to the dissent, the 
second prong of the Midcal analysis, the requirement of state supervision, assuages that concern.  We believe that Midcal itself 
illustrates the invalidity of the presumption that state compulsion and state supervision have the same rationale.  If the dissent 
were correct, the Supreme Court would have upheld state action immunity on the facts of Midcal, for state supervision would 
have been unnecessary since the state requirement mandating the filing of contracts and schedules would serve the same 
purpose.  The Court did not, however, so rule, and rightly, for the state does not deprive competitors of their ability to subvert 
competition merely by requiring them to collude.  Rather, as noted earlier, the state compulsion requirement fulfills a purpose 
entirely different from that underlying state supervision: it reaffirms the holding of Parker that an action must in effect be by the 
state as sovereign. If private parties were able to choose whether to follow some course of action, the decision concerning 
whether to pursue that action hardly could be said to be by the state."
855,9," It is perhaps ironic that the government seeks to enjoin as a violation of federal antitrust laws activity by motor carriers 
operating in intrastate commerce that is exempted from federal antitrust laws when performed at the interstate level.  Appellant 
SMCRC attempts to elevate this irony into an argument for implied immunity from the antitrust laws. We reject this argument. "
856,," HN5[
] Under 49 U.S.C. § 10706, the collective formulation of rates by motor carriers operating in interstate commerce is exempt from federal antitrust laws once these rates are approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  According to 
SMCRC, this express exemption should be extended to collective rate formulation at the intrastate level.  As authority for this 
position, SMCRC relies on Atchison, Topeka & Sante Fe Railway Co. v. United States, 597 F.2d 593 (7th Cir. 1979), which held 
that this section should be construed to exempt intrastate railroad collective ratemaking that affects interstate commerce.  The 
result in Atchison is explainable, and clearly distinguishable from this case, on the ground that HN6[
] the ICC has jurisdiction 
under the Shreveport rate doctrine over intrastate railroad rates that affect interstate commerce.  See Houston East & West 
Texas Railway Co. v. United States, 234 U.S. 342, 34 S. Ct. 833, 58 L. Ed. 1341 (1942). The ICC has no similar jurisdiction over 
intrastate motor carrier rates.  Indeed, 49 U.S.C. § 10521(b) expressly reserves this area for state regulation. In the alternative, SMCRC contends that the pervasive state regulation permitted by Section 10521(b) creates an irreconcilable 
conflict with federal antitrust laws which warrants an implied repeal of the antitrust laws in this situation.  As SMCRC concedes, 
the implied repeal doctrine normally applies only to conflicts between federal antitrust laws and federal regulation, not to conflicts 
with state regulation. Moreover, the Supreme Court has observed repeatedly that ""repeals HN7[
] of the antitrust laws by 
implication from a regulatory statute are strongly disfavored, and have been found only in cases of plain repugnancy between 
the antitrust and regulatory provisions."" United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350-51, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 
1734, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963). This presumption against implied repeal is just as strong where the conflict is with state 
regulatory policy.  Cantor, 428 U.S. at 596-97 & nn.36, 37, 96 S. Ct. at 3120-21 & nn.36, 37. Even where such repugnancy is 
found, the antitrust laws are abrogated only to the extent necessary for the effective functioning of the regulatory scheme.  Silver 
v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 1257, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963). We detect no irreconcilable conflict of the federal antitrust policy with either the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. § 10521(b), 
or with the existence of state regulation. As we noted above, the ICC has no jurisdiction over intrastate motor carrier rates.  The 
Interstate Commerce Act then poses no conflict with the application of the federal antitrust laws to collective intrastate 
ratemaking among motor carriers. As to state regulatory policy, if an implied exemption is necessary for the effective functioning 
of the state scheme, the states may act to immunize private action taken in response to state policy by compelling private 
conduct as part of a clearly established or affirmatively expressed state policy."
856,10," The State of Georgia, participating as amicus in the district court, presented a 1942 order issued by its public service 
commission stating that ""all for hire motor common carriers operating under Class A certificates be, and they are hereby, 
directed and required to publish and file with this Commission … a tariff containing all local and joint class and/or commodity 
rates applicable between points within Georgia."" Record at 693.  Pointing to the italicized language, the state argued that the 
commission ""clearly directed all Class ""A' carriers to file a single joint tariff with the Commission,"" thus indicating its policy in 
favor of collective action.  Id.  We are not persuaded that the language of the 1942 order is susceptible of only this interpretation.  
At best it is ambiguous.  Given the statute, only recently amended to insert the provisions outlined in text, it would not, in any 
event, be controlling."
856,11," A ""joint rate"" is a single rate applied jointly by two carriers to cover a shipment in which one carrier operates over only part of 
the route and the other carrier serves the remaining distance to the destination."
856,12," We note that, even if state compulsion were not a requirement after Midcal, we would still find the state action exception 
inapplicable here because of the absence of a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy in favor of joint rate 
applications in any state at issue.  In none of these states do the statutes do more than, at most, authorize joint rate agreements.  
""(A) HN8[
] state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring 
that their action is lawful."" Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 344, 351, 63 S. Ct. 307, 310, 313, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). Moreover, 
Cantor indicates that, for a state to have a clear policy in favor of an action, that action must be essential to the functioning of the "
857,," state regulatory system.  428 U.S. at 597-98. No state's statutes or regulations indicate, nor does the evidence show, that joint 
rate agreements are necessary for state ratesetting procedures to work."
857,13," In Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), the 
Supreme Court legitimated the joint efforts of businessmen to influence legislative or executive action, even though these efforts 
were designed to injure their competitors.  In holding that this ""combination"" was not actionable under the Sherman Act, the 
Court stated: A construction of the Sherman Act that would disqualify people from taking a public position on matters in which they are 
financially interested would thus deprive the government of a valuable source of information and, at the same time, deprive the 
people of their right to petition in the very instances in which that right may be of the most importance to them. Id. at 139, 81 S. Ct. at 530. Later in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), 
the Court followed Noerr in the context of efforts by large mining companies and labor unions to persuade the Secretary of Labor 
to set wage rates at such high levels that the mines' smaller competitors would be driven out of business.  ""(J)oint HN9[
] 
efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition."" Id. at 670, 85 
S. Ct. at 1593. In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), the 
Court approved the notion that Noerr's protection extends to activities aimed at influencing administrative agencies."
857,14," With respect to the right to petition aspect of the bureaus' claim, ""it is well settled that First Amendment rights are not 
immunized from regulation when they are used as an integral part of conduct which violates a valid statute."" California Motor 
Transport, 404 U.S. at 514, 92 S. Ct. at 613 (citing Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 69 S. Ct. 684, 93 L. Ed. 
834 (1949)). "
858,15," Appellants attempt to undercut the force of the Supreme Court's rationale by pointing out that in states such as North Carolina 
the public service commission regulates not only the reasonableness of rates but also the collective agreement pursuant to 
which rate proposals are formulated.  See N.C.Gen.Stat. § 62-152.1 (Cum.Supp.1981).  In essence, appellants argue that the 
fact of state regulation not only renders their activities immune as state action but also precludes characterization of their 
activities as price fixing. They press the point even further by arguing that the regulatory context of this case mandates 
application of a rule of reason analysis.  For reasons we shall discuss infra, we decline to accord such extensive significance to 
the impact of state regulation."
858,16," The Interstate Commerce Commission has so viewed collective ratemaking agreements as to interstate activity. (W)hether HN12[
] an agreement will have anticompetitive effects is presumed.  This presumption arises from the holdings of 
the Courts that the interests to be protected by the antitrust laws are always harmed by collective rate-making agreements and 
that agreements such as these violate the antitrust laws per se without official exemption. Tidewater Coal Demurrage Agreement, 356 I.C.C. 66, 75 (1978). See also H.Rep. No. 1100, 80th Cong. 2d Sess. (1947), 
reprinted in (1948) U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1844 (referring to the uncertainty as to the legality under the antitrust laws of such 
agreements). "
859,17," Broadcast Music was decided together with American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc."
859,18," The licensing scheme employed by both ASCAP and BMI followed a similar pattern.  Owners of copyrighted works, who 
under copyright law alone possess the exclusive right to perform the work publicly for profit, grant the organization of which they 
are a member (ASCAP or BMI) a nonexclusive right to license performances of their work.  A blanket license from ASCAP or 
BMI gives the licensee, for a flat fee or percentage of total revenues, the right to perform any and all of the compositions owned 
by members of the organization as often as desired for a stated term.  The organization distributes royalties generated by the 
licenses among its members in a manner that reflects the nature and amount of use of their music."
859,19," Broadcast Music and its rule of reason approach are distinguishable on yet another ground.  The Court noted that the blanket 
license offered by ASCAP and BMI was a product different from the license which could be offered by individual copyright 
owners since the former consisted of many individual compositions plus the aggregating services performed by the organization.  
Hence, ASCAP and BMI were sellers, separate from the copyright owners, in a product market in which individual composers 
could not compete.  441 U.S. at 21-23, 99 S. Ct. at 1563-64. The rate bureaus cannot be viewed analogously as purveyors of a 
product or service which could not be provided by their individual constituent member carriers."
859,20," Asserted advantages include cost-savings in the formulation and publication of rate tariffs, which in turn enable small carriers, 
which lack the means to prepare and justify their own rate proposals, to remain competitive with large carriers."
859,21," We are aware that our colleagues in the Ninth Circuit have declined to apply a per se rule to the setting by majority vote of 
maximum fees that physician members of foundations for medical care (FMC) may claim in full payment for health services they 
provide to policy holders of FMC-approved insurance plans.  Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 643 F.2d 553 (9th Cir. "
860,1980," ), cert. granted, 450 U.S. 979, 101 S. Ct. 1512, 67 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1981). This result, we believe, is based on too broad a 
reading of the decision in Broadcast Music. "
861,22," See note 4, supra; cf.  Cantor, 428 U.S. at 592-95, 96 S. Ct. at 3118-19 (discussing an unfairness theory as support for 
clothing private conduct required by the state with state action immunity); Mid-Texas Communications, 615 F.2d at 1380 
(""Fairness to the regulated industry is an important factor … in determining whether antitrust immunity exists."")."
861,1," Midcal was decided after the district court had entered final judgment in this case.  Hence the district court did not have the 
benefit, as do we, of the Supreme Court's pronouncement on this subject."
861,2," In announcing its two-pronged test in Midcal, the Court purported to derive it from the Parker line of cases, citing cases 
involving private defendants, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), and Cantor v. 
Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976), as well as cases involving governmental 
defendants, Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977), and New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. 
Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978). "
862,3," There may be substantive limits on what conduct the state may immunize by making the challenged restraint a state policy. 
Indeed, there is some suggestion in Supreme Court precedent that federal antitrust laws do place substantive limits on the 
content of state economic regulation. See, e.g., Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 71 S. Ct. 745, 95 L. 
Ed. 1035 (1951) (invalidating a Louisiana fair trade statute containing a ""non-signer"" provision under which a retailer could be 
enjoined from knowingly underselling another retailer whose prices were set under a resale price maintenance contract, exempt 
from antitrust laws under the Miller-Tydings Act, with a supplier).  But see 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 70 (1978) 
(interpreting this decision as an inadequate supervision case).  See generally Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State 
Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws, 49 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 693 (1974). Those limits may be reached in areas, unlike the private 
utility regulation involved here, that have not traditionally been regulated by the states. Fortunately, we are not called upon here to delineate those boundaries.  At least one member of the Supreme Court and some 
commentators have urged an express preemption analysis, which involves the difficult weighing of the state interest at stake 
against the federal interest in a competitive economy.  See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 605, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 
3124, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976) (Blackmun, J., concurring); Posner, supra; Note, Parker v. Brown Revisited: The State Action 
Doctrine After Goldfarb, Cantor, and Bates, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 898, 929-30 (1977) (suggesting that a preemption analysis 
explains the Court's result in some of the cases in the Parker line).  But see Cantor, 428 U.S. at 627, 96 S. Ct. at 3134 (Stewart, 
J., dissenting) (warning that a preemption approach is a return to the discarded substantive due process doctrine).  Cf.  
Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 845, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., 
dissenting) (arguing that state action should be analyzed as a preemption problem).  The Court, however, has never forthrightly 
adopted this approach, and, for the present, it appears to have resolved the tension between federalism and antitrust concerns 
on the side of federalism, albeit with the requirement of active state supervision of the anticompetitive activity.  Midcal thus 
reiterates the federalism concerns at the heart of Parker. "
863,4," Professor Areeda has suggested that Midcal's active supervision requirement is inapplicable to governmental defendants.  
Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435, 445 n.50 (1981) (""A few courts erroneously 
appear to use the Midcal formula (clearly articulated state policy plus active supervision of private parties) to require state 
supervision of governmental defendants."").  In Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, the Supreme Court expressly 
declined to decide whether the active supervision criterion must be met by a municipality with respect to the challenged 
ordinance.  455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 841 n.14, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982). If that criterion serves the function identified above, 
Professor Areeda's suggestion would appear correct."
863,5," The existence of a state action immunity enables states, like the federal government itself, to define areas inappropriate for 
market control.  Moreover, the adequate supervision criterion ensures that state-federal conflict will be avoided in those areas in 
which the state has demonstrated its commitment to a program through its exercise of regulatory oversight.  At the same time, it 
guarantees that when the Sherman Act is set aside, private firms are not left to their own devices.  Rather, immunity will be 
granted only when the state has substituted its own supervision for the economic constraints of the competitive market."
863,1," P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 73 (1978) (footnotes omitted)."
863,6," As indicated by the majority, see note 5 supra in the majority opinion, the government did not contend on appeal that the active 
supervision requirement has not been satisfied. "
874,*," Honorable Wesley E. Brown, Senior District Judge for the District of Kansas, is sitting by designation. "
875,1," Edison's other contractors, who were members of one of the Trade Associations, were not named as defendants, although 
they too are alleged to have participated in the escrow agreement."
875,2," The amount paid to the escrow account was in addition to the existing wage scale. Thus, if the agreement ultimately reached 
between the union and the Trade Associations called for a $ 1.25 per hour wage increase, that amount would be paid out of the 
escrow fund, with the remainder returned to the contractor."
875,3," One of the trade associations first filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the district union had 
failed to bargain in good faith.  This claim was rejected by the Board.  Letter from Alex V. Barbour, Regional Director, to Charles 
E. Murphy (Sept. 6, 1979) (Re: Carpenters District Council of Will County and Vicinity (Mid-America Regional Bargaining 
Association) Case 13-CB-8611)."
875,4," The court's opinion did not explain its dismissal of the state claims.  However, as the defendants demonstrated in their briefs to 
the district court, dismissal of the state claims for lack of pendent jurisdiction was appropriate once the Sherman Act claim was 
dismissed.  UMW v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). The plaintiffs do not challenge this 
aspect of the decision on appeal. "

877,10," HN10[
]  29 U.S.C. § 102 provides: Whereas under prevailing economic conditions … the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual 
liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, 
wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of 
association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of 
his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in 
the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purposes of collective 
bargaining or other mutual aid or protection …."
877,11," Although the Court in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940), examined the Clayton 
and Norris-LaGuardia Act provisions, the Court's decision in that case appears to have rested upon a determination that the 
conduct did not violate the terms of the Sherman Act. Thus, it was not necessary to examine the statutory exemption. "
878,12," The Supreme Court made it clear in Local 24, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 296, 79 S. Ct. 297, 304, 3 L. Ed. 
2d 312 (1959), that Allen Bradley was intended to set only ""outside limits"" on the normal rule that agreements reached 
concerning subjects of mandatory bargaining cannot lead to liability for violation of laws.  The Court noted that such an approach 
was necessary to further the congressional policy ""as expressed in the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts"" of the ""promotion of 
collective bargaining."" Id. at 295, 79 S. Ct. at 304."
878,13," While the plaintiffs' complaint could be read to allege the existence of a conspiracy apart from the escrow agreement, such a 
reading would not be justified.  The only factual assertion supporting the plaintiffs' conspiracy claim is the existence of the 
escrow agreement.  The balance of the complaint simply infers a conspiracy from the existence of that agreement and alleges 
that it was entered into pursuant to ""a conspiracy."" This is insufficient, however.  HN13[
] Mere ""conclusory allegations 
unsupported by any factual assertions will not withstand a motion to dismiss."" Briscoe v. LaHue, 663 F.2d 713, 723 (7th Cir. 
1981). See Larry R. George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266, 273 (5th Cir. 1979) (""A general allegation of conspiracy "
879,," … without a statement of the facts constituting the conspiracy, is a mere allegation of a legal conclusion and is inadequate of 
itself to state a cause of action.  The pleader must allege the facts constituting the conspiracy, its object and accomplishment.""). HN14[
]"
879,14," Although the alleged ""escrow agreement"" between Newberg and the district union was not, strictly speaking, a collective 
bargaining agreement, the cases discussed herein are nevertheless applicable.  The agreement, allegedly reached was quite 
similar to a traditional collective bargaining agreement: it was between an employer and the collective bargaining agent of its 
employees over a subject of mandatory bargaining-wages.  The fact that the final wage was not final, but rather was dependent 
on an external factor-the size of the wage increase granted by the Trade Associations-does not deprive it of that character.  The 
cases holding that a collective bargaining agreement should not serve as the sole evidence of a conspiracy do not focus upon 
the formal requirements of a collective bargaining agreement. Rather, they focus upon the inappropriateness of basing a finding 
of antitrust conspiracy on an agreement reached as a result of the collective bargaining process commanded by the labor laws.  
A narrower reading of these cases would do substantial damage to the Norris-LaGuardia Act's goal of ""full freedom … to 
negotiate the terms and conditions of … employment,"" 29 U.S.C. § 102, as well as the National Labor Relations Act's goal of 
reducing ""industrial strife and unrest."" HN15[
]  29 U.S.C. § 151."
879,15," Where collective bargaining agreements pertain to subjects which are not mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, some 
courts have held that the agreements can serve as evidence of a conspiracy. Under § 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 
29 U.S.C. § 158(d), mandatory subjects of bargaining are ""wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment."" Thus, 
Justice White's opinion in Local 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 
640 (1965), found that where a union and an employer agree on mandatory subjects of bargaining an exemption applies, but the 
exemption is lost when agreement is reached on such topics as prices, which are not proper subjects of collective bargaining. 
See American Fed'n of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 108, 88 S. Ct. 1562, 1568, 20 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1968); L. Sullivan 
Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 727-28 (1977). Here, HN16[
] the collective bargaining agreement concerned itself with wages-explicitly identified as a proper subject of 
collective bargaining. Thus, the statutory exemption applies.  See Bodine Produce, Inc. v. United Farm Workers Organizing 
Comm., 494 F.2d 541, 551 (9th Cir. 1974) (""Union-imposed restraints which serve purposes closely related to wage, hours, and 
conditions of employment generally are considered free of Allen Bradley taint."").  The logic behind this position is clear.  "" 
""Collective-bargaining agreements over labor standards inevitably have anticompetitive consequences; to infer from these 
agreements the necessary elements of a conspiracy to restrain trade under the antitrust laws makes no accommodation for the 
fact that the national labor policy is based upon the conclusion of these agreements.' "" Smitty Baker Coal Co. v. UMW, 620 F.2d 
416, 423 n.10 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 101 S. Ct. 207, 66 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1980) (quoting Comment, Labor-Antitrust: 
Collective Bargaining and the Competitive Economy, 20 Stan.L.Rev. 684, 704 (1968)). See also Leslie, Principles of Labor 
Antitrust, 66 Va.L.Rev. 1183, 1203 (1980). "
880,16," One commentator has distinguished Justice White's opinion in Pennington from his opinion in its companion case, Local 189, 
Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965), on this basis.  ""In 
Pennington the union had openly conspired with a group of employers,"" while ""(i)n Jewel Tea, on the other hand, the collective 
bargaining agreement itself constituted the labor-non-labor combination."" Comment, Labor's Antitrust Exemption After 
Pennington and Jewel Tea, 66 Colum.L.Rev. 742, 755 (1966)."
880,17," The Court also found that the nonstatutory exemption did not apply.  See text accompanying notes 25-27, infra. There is no allegation in the plaintiffs' complaint that the union adopted a ""take it or leave it"" stance in negotiations with the 
plaintiff contractors. Indeed, the National Labor Relations Board found that this was not the case.  See note 3, supra.  Thus, all 
that can be inferred from the escrow agreement is a promise by the employer to be bound by any wage increase, up to $ 2.25 
per hour, that the union could negotiate with other contractors. Such agreements have never been held violative of the antitrust 
laws. Furthermore, even if the union had adopted such a position the plaintiffs would have to allege that this position stemmed from a 
shared purpose with a non-labor group, and was not maintained by a union "" ""as a matter of its own policy.' "" Ramsey v. UMW, 
401 U.S. 302, 312-13, 91 S. Ct. 658, 664-65, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1971) (quoting UMW v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 1590, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965))."
880,18," Further support for this proposition is provided by the Supreme Court's opinion in Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers & 
Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). There, the Court found that a union representing 
workers in the building trades violated the antitrust laws by exacting an agreement from a contractor not to subcontract work to 
firms lacking a collective bargaining agreement with the union.  The Court noted that the union had no interest in representing 
the contractor's employees.  Therefore, it noted that ""(t)here can be no argument in this case, whatever its force in other 
contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude might be entitled to an antitrust exemption if it were included in a lawful collective-
bargaining agreement."" Id. at 625-26, 95 S. Ct. at 1836. This suggests that HN19[
] an agreement would not be sufficient to 
evince a conspiracy where it was only contained in a collective bargaining agreement. See Smitty Baker Coal Co. v. UMW, 620 
F.2d 416, 424 n.19 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 101 S. Ct. 207, 66 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1980); Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. 
Southwestern Pa. Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 609 F.2d 1368, 1373 (3d Cir. 1979); Commerce Tankers v. National Maritime 
Union, 553 F.2d 793, 801 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 923, 98 S. Ct. 400, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1977). "
881,19," Indeed, Pennington is sometimes viewed as a case in which the Supreme Court permitted an allegation of conspiracy to be 
based solely on an agreement concerning a subject of mandatory bargaining. See, e.g., St. Antoine, Connell: Antitrust Law at 
the Expense of Labor Law, 62 Va.L.Rev. 603, 621 (1976)."
881,20," This approach tends to result in combining what the Supreme Court in Connell noted were two separate analyses.  The court 
below thus seemed to base its decision on a combination of statutory and nonstatutory exemption grounds.  While the court 
looked to specific statutes, its analysis of impact on the labor and business markets is identified in Connell as analysis 
appropriate to determining whether there is a basis for a nonstatutory exemption."
881,21," The complaint HN21[
] alleges that each party knew the likely results of its actions and, therefore, intended them.  This is 
not enough, absent an allegation of purpose, to plead a cause of action under Pennington.  As the court in Embry-Riddle 
Aeronautical Univ. v. Ross Aviation, Inc., 504 F.2d 896, 903 (5th Cir. 1974), noted: A rule of law requiring a lower level of intent than purpose would open the way to disastrous incursions upon Congressionally-
sanctified areas of labor union activity.  When a union imposes a collective bargaining agreement upon Company X, it will 
always advantage X by forcing the same agreement on competitor Company Y which theretofore offered less advantageous 
terms and working conditions.  This is a fact of commercial life known to all unions.  But if possession of that knowledge should "
882,," mean that the union had to tread warily in negotiating with Y, refraining from striking, for example, or from taking a rigid 
bargaining stance for fear of losing the antitrust exemption, labor policy would be stood on its head."
882,22," Although both the statutory and the nonstatutory exemptions are generally phrased as exemptions for union behavior, logic 
dictates that they be applied to all parties when an agreement with a union forms the basis of a complaint.  The exemptions 
would serve little purpose in furthering national labor policy if employers risked liability under the antitrust laws for entering into 
collective bargaining agreements.  Other circuits have concurred in this judgment.  ""To preserve the integrity of the negotiating 
process, employers who bargain in good faith must be entitled to claim the antitrust exemption."" Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco 
Corp., 494 F.2d 840, 847 n.14 (3d Cir. 1974). See also Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butchers Local 576 v. Wetterau Foods, 
Inc., 597 F.2d 133, 136 (8th Cir. 1979); Mackey v. NFL, 543 F.2d 606, 612 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. 
Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977)."
882,23," Others place the genesis of the nonstatutory exemption much later, with the Supreme Court's decision in Local 189, 
Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965). See, e.g., California Dump 
Truck Owners Ass'n v. Associated Gen. Contractors, 562 F.2d 607, 611 (9th Cir. 1977)."
882,24," There is some question whether Apex Hosiery represents a finding of a lack of substantive liability as opposed to a finding 
that the conduct was exempted.  Thus, one author states in one part of an article that ""the actual holding"" of Apex Hosiery ""was 
that a union did not violate the Sherman Act by engaging in a violent primary sit-down strike,"" and in another that ""the "
883,," nonstatutory exemption apparently originated"" in Apex Hosiery.  St. Antoine, Connell: Antitrust Law at the Expense of Labor 
Law, 62 Va.L.Rev. 603, 606, 618 n.64 (1976). While Justice Douglas decried the tendency to confuse the questions of liability 
and exemption, Ramsey v. UMW, 401 U.S. 302, 314, 91 S. Ct. 658, 665, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1971) (Douglas, J., dissenting), much 
of the analysis of Apex Hosiery has been adopted in examining the nonstatutory exemption. See, e.g., UMW v. Pennington, 381 
U.S. 657, 666, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 1591, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
883,25," While Justice White did not write for a majority of the Court in Pennington or Jewel Tea, the Court has since looked to his 
opinions as authoritative expositions of the nonstatutory exemption. See Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 
100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975)."
883,26," See text accompanying notes 15-17, supra."
883,27, Justice White's opinion received the votes of only two other Justices.  There was no opinion of the Court.
883,28," HN25[
]  29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5) imposes a duty upon employers to engage in collective bargaining with employees. "
884,29," A more general statement is that ""the HN26[
] availability of the nonstatutory exemption for a particular agreement turns 
upon whether the relevant federal labor policy is deserving of pre-eminence over federal antitrust policy under the circumstances 
of the particular case."" Mackey v. NFL, 543 F.2d 606, 613 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 
2d 59 (1977) (citations omitted).  The Connell labor-business market distinction appears to serve as a generally applicable 
standard for making this determination.  Id. at 614. Where an agreement primarily affects the labor market, the policy favoring 
collective bargaining is preeminent, but when an agreement has a direct impact on the business market, the antitrust laws are of 
greater concern."
884,30," The Connell opinion's use of the term ""business market"" instead of ""product market"" was not, apparently, indicative of a 
change in the Court's approach.  421 U.S. at 622, 95 S. Ct. at 1835. "
885,31," The Supreme Court has taken a broad view of what constitutes an agreement with a direct impact on the labor market. Thus, 
in Local 24, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 79 S. Ct. 297, 3 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1959), the Supreme Court examined 
a state antitrust challenge to a collective bargaining agreement. The agreement provided for a minimum wage scale for truck 
drivers and, to prevent evasion, included a provision that drivers who owned and operated their own vehicles would be paid a 
prescribed rental for their vehicles in addition to the required wage. The Supreme Court found that the state antitrust laws could 
not be applied.  The Court found that the agreement was one directly affecting wages, and not "" ""a remote and indirect approach 
to the subject of wages.' "" Id. at 293, 79 S. Ct. at 303. "
908,1," .  Early in the trial, defense counsel questioned the notion that there had been any limitation on research and development to 
funds derived from ""profits"".  After further proof and admissions, the question became one of whether the limitation was to 
""profits"" or ""gross profits"".  Later in the trial this distinction was abandoned entirely by defense counsel.  In any event, it makes 
little difference since earnings can not be spent for research over a period of time unless they exceed expenses, and they never 
did in StimTech during the relevant period of time. "
930,2," .  Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in 
any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony and, on conviction thereof, shall 
be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, one hundred thousand dollars or 
by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. "
931,3," .  One prominent commentator expresses the present state of the law in the following fashion: Restated, the governing law has been that HN9[
] the Sherman Act bans all concerted arrangements which are adopted for the 
purpose of reducing competition, or which, regardless of purpose, have a significant tendency to reduce competition, but that 
arrangements which are adopted for and tend to achieve other purposes do not fall within the condemnation of the Act merely 
because of some incidental and inconsequential restraining effect on competition. L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 166 (1977). "
933,4," .  See pages 1341-1342, infra. "
937,5," .  Johnson & Johnson also claims that because the company itself, as opposed to its many subsidiaries, does not sell any 
products within any of the relevant markets, it cannot be held to violate the attempt portion of § 2.  However, as the company at 
no time moved for a directed verdict on this issue, the Court finds the company to have waived this defense.  See F.R.Civ.P. 51. "
939,6," .  The Department of Justice has, without conspicuous success, opposed this view: In recent years the Government has argued strongly against limiting the attempted monopoly doctrine to circumstances where 
there is a showing of dangerous probability of monopolization within a relevant market …  To eliminate the ""dangerous 
probability"" and ""market"" requirements from Section 2 attempt to monopolize cases would make it a much more effective tool for 
treating with indefensible single firm conduct. Remarks, Donald I. Baker, Director of Policy Planning, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, Section 2 Enforcement.  The

967,6," The defendants concur that when material false statements are made in filings with government agencies, venue will lie in the 
district in which the agency received the filing, since the statute makes the filing of such statements illegal.  See Travis v. United 
States, 364 U.S. 631, 5 L. Ed. 2d 340, 81 S. Ct. 358 (1961). However, they claim that a different analysis applies in this case 
because the filings contain no material false statements.  The distinction is not a valid one.  Travis and similar cases focus on 
statements within the filing, while this case focuses on the purpose for which the filing was made.  Just as false statements can 
violate a particular statute, so too can tariff filings which are the product of collusive rate-making violate the Sherman Act. In 
either case the filing with the federal agency properly gives rise to venue in the district in which the filling was made. "

971,11," The defendants also argue that the Aircoach Court was mistaken because it relied on Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R., 324 U.S. 
439, 89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945), a case whose holding, they contend, Congress negated by passing the Reed-
Bulwinkle Act in 1948.  But Judge Fahy, who wrote the Aircoach opinion, was not quite so blundering as the defendants suggest.  
Rather, there is scant doubt that the Georgia decision is still good law.  The case involved not merely collusive ratemaking but, 
also, rate discrimination in favor of northern ports and shippers and against the ports and shippers of Georgia.  The defendants 
were also charged with coercion of those individual railroads which desired to set nondiscriminatory rates.  The defendants 
argued that their acts were immunized by a War Production Board certification to the Attorney General, pursuant to section 12 of 
the Small Business Mobilization Act, 50 App. U.S.C. 1112, providing that rate bureaus were of sufficient importance to the 
prosecution of the war to warrant a temporary grant of relief from antitrust prosecution for joint ratemaking activities.  In other 
words, the certificate provided during wartime the same immunity available since 1948 under the Reed-Bulwinkle Act.  The Court 
rejected the argument that coercive and discriminatory activities were immunized by the certificate.  324 U.S. at 459 n. 7. "

parties be given an opportunity to speak at rate meetings, (5) that rate agreements be published, and (6) that each member of 
the rate bureau maintain the right of independent action. "

983,7," It should be noted that HN2[
] the fact that a party successfully establishes that the Noerr-Pennington exception is 
inapplicable does not entitle it to a judgment.  Such a showing would merely establish that defendant's conduct was subject to 
the antitrust laws. ""[The] absence of an immunity does not itself establish an antitrust offense.  To prevail, the plaintiff must 
demonstrate that any non-immune behavior meets the standard tests defining an antitrust violation."" Areeda & Turner, Antitrust 
Law § 201 (1978). "
984,8," Because we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for a trial on the merits, we need not determine whether the 
district court judge acted properly in denying Clipper's 59(e) motion to vacate and reconsider."
984,9," Rule 59(e) provides that ""[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the 
judgment."" See Pacific Maritime Ass'n v. Quinn, 465 F.2d 108, 109 n.1 (1972) (service, not filing, tolls the running of time to file 
notice of appeal).  Clipper served its 59(e) motion on August 10, 1978, after a July 31, 1978 entry of judgment.  Thus, under the 
rules of time computations provided in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this motion was served within the time 
strictures established in 59(e). "
985,10," HN5[
] Rule 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states: ""When a motion is supported by affidavit, the affidavit shall be served with the motion . . . ."" If, as here, a motion is complete without supporting affidavits, there is no reason to determine 
whether compliance with this filing requirement is jurisdictional when the affidavits are necessary to make the motion complete.  
We note, however, the position of the Seventh Circuit in Schy v. Susquehanna Corp., 419 F.2d 1112 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 
U.S. 826, 91 S. Ct. 51, 27 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1970). In Schy, the Seventh Circuit held that when the plaintiff did not complain of untimeliness of filing affidavits at the district court 
level, any objection based on that untimeliness was waived on appeal.  Id. at 1116. It is questionable whether any proper 
objection to the untimeliness of these affidavits was raised at trial.  Clearly, the defendant-appellees did not object to the late 
filing of the affidavits.  They commented only that the affidavits came too late to substantively oppose the summary judgment. 
That is irrelevant to the 59(e) motion.  A defendant who is not a party to this appeal questioned the timeliness of the affidavits 
under Rule 59(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 59(c) relates to filing affidavits to support a motion for new trial, 
and does not apply to a 59(e) motion. Because we hold, however, that the 59(e) motion was complete without the affidavits we need not determine whether the 59(c) 
assertion was sufficient to preserve the question of timeliness for appeal. "
986,11," The defendants cite Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 889-90 (E.D.Va.1977); Erickson Tool Co. v. Balas Collet Co., 277 F. 
Supp. 226, 234 (N.D.Ohio 1967), aff'd., 404 F.2d 35 (6th Cir. 1968); Chastain v. Kelley, 167 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 510 F.2d 1232, 
1238 n.7 (D.C.Cir.1975), for the proposition that a 59(e) motion is not proper if it advances no new grounds in seeking to vacate 
a judgment.  None of these cases involved the question of whether the motion tolled the running of time to file notice of appeal. 
All were concerned with whether the motion should have been granted.  That is not at issue here.  Furthermore, the position of 
these cases, in holding that a 59(e) motion must raise new grounds, is questionable.  There is much authority to the contrary.  
See Dove v. Codesco, 569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978); Sonnenblick Goldman Corp. v. Norwalk, 420 F.2d 858, 859 (3d Cir. 
1970); Parks v. ""Mr. Ford"", 68 F.R.D. 305 (E.D.Pa.1975)."
986,12," This Circuit, in determining whether a motion for a new trial was timely, noted in dictum: ""It is true that the motion for an 
extension of time within which to file a motion for new trial stated no grounds for which a new trial would be sought; but the fact 
that this motion, considered as an inartfully drawn motion for new trial was so defective that it could not properly be granted, 
would not serve to render it non-existent.  This court has held that in order to suspend the running of the 30-day appeal period 
allowed by Rule 73(a) a motion for new trial need not be granted or even grantable."" Yanow v. Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co., 274 
F.2d 274, 283 (9th Cir. 1959) (en banc), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 919, 80 S. Ct. 671, 4 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1960). Under this liberal approach, Clipper's motion was clearly sufficient to toll the time for filing a Notice of Appeal."
986,13," Because we hold that the record before the trial judge at the time the summary judgment was granted did not support that 
judgment, we need not consider the late filed affidavits in reaching our holding.  Therefore, defendants' contention that the late 
filed affidavits could not be used to support reversal of summary judgment need not be considered. "
987,14," HN8[
] Ordinarily, the proper mode of testing the legal sufficiency of the allegations of a complaint is by way of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  Such a motion can be 
made at any time, and normally will be made before any substantial discovery has been conducted.  However, where, as here, 
evidence outside the record is submitted to and not excluded by the district court, any such motion must be disposed of by way 
of the summary judgment procedures specified in Rule 56(c).  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)."
987,15," In a short order granting RMMTB's motion for summary judgment, the district court held: (1) Clipper's ""claim, insofar as it is 
based on defendants' protests before the Interstate Commerce Commission, is barred by the . . ."" Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  
""Plaintiff's attempt to invoke the ""sham"" exception to that immunity . . . is . . . foreclosed by the narrow reading of that exception 
announced in Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v. San Francisco Local Joint Executive Board of Culinary Workers. . . ."" The 
district court continued: ""Furthermore, plaintiff's damage claims, which rest on assumptions as to action that would have been 
taken by the ICC in the absence of defendant's alleged antitrust violations are barred by Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. . . ."" 
The district court order did not individually consider the viability of the theories alleging that the furnishing of fraudulent 
information constituted an antitrust violation and that the protest was simply part of an independent antitrust violation."
987,16," An analysis of cases dealing with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is subject to the following caveat: [Each] case arising under the Sherman Act must be determined upon the particular facts disclosed by the record, and that 
the opinions in those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the essential differences in "
988,," the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to which the rule of earlier decisions is to be applied."" Maple 
Flooring Mfrs. Ass'n v. United States, 268 U.S. 563, 579 [45 S. Ct. 578, 583, 69 L. Ed. 1093] (1925). "
989,17,"  Yet unethical conduct in the setting of the adjudicatory process often results in sanctions.  Perjury of witnesses is one 
example.  Use of a patent obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor from the market may involve a violation of the antitrust 
laws, as we held in Walker Process Equipment v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 175-77, 86 S. Ct. 347, 
349-50, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247. Conspiracy with a licensing authority to eliminate a competitor may also result in an antitrust 
transgression.  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 707, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1414, 8 L. Ed. 2d 
777; Harman v. Valley National Bank, 339 F.2d 564 (CA 9 1964). Similarly, bribery of a public purchasing agent may 
constitute a violation of § 2(c) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.  Rangen Inc. v. Sterling Nelson 
& Sons, 351 F.2d 851 (CA 9 1965). There are many other forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes 
and which may result in antitrust violations.  Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when 
used in the adjudicatory process.  Opponents before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other's tactics, motions, or 
defenses and may readily call them baseless. One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; 
but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and 
judicial processes have been abused.  That may be a difficult line to discern and draw.  But once it is drawn, the case is 
established that abuse of those processes produced an illegal result, viz., effectively barring respondents from access to 
the agencies and courts.  Insofar as the administrative or judicial processes are involved, actions of that kind cannot 
acquire immunity by seeking refuge under the umbrella of ""political expression."" 404 U.S. at 512-13, 92 S. Ct. at 613."
989,18," The district court wrote: ""[The] repetitive use of litigation by Otter Tail was timed and designed principally to prevent the 
establishment of municipal electric systems and thereby to preserve defendant's monopoly . . . the litigation comes within the 
sham exception to the Noerr doctrine as defined by the Supreme Court in California Transport. . . ."" 360 F. Supp. at 451-52. "
990,19," Whether defendants' protests constitute one or multiple claims is a matter of interpretation.  There is one basic tariff -- Tariff 55 
-- involved here.  During the course of the investigation, however, Tariff 55 was modified by Clipper many times.  After each 
modification the defendants lodged a new protest. Each protest was necessary to preserve the initial protest, or else the newly 
revised Tariff 55 would go into effect, mooting the prior protest. Whether this constitutes one or multiple claims is unclear.  We 
need not reach that question because we find the sham exception applicable even if there is only a single claim involved."
990,20," The conduct which the Trucking Unlimited Court held to fall within the sham exception constituted a pattern of repetitive 
claims.  The defendant highway carriers in Trucking Unlimited continually instituted state and federal proceedings to defeat "
991,," applications by other highway carriers to acquire operating rights or to transfer or register those rights.  In holding that a cause of 
action under the sham exception was stated, the Court referred to ""a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims [which] may emerge 
[and lead] the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial process have been abused."" 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. 
at 613."
991,21," Noerr advanced at least three arguments for the exception, but did not clearly adopt any.  First, the Court noted that there is 
an ""essential dissimilarity"" between agreements to seek government action and those agreements traditionally condemned by 
the antitrust laws. This essential dissimilarity, ""even if not itself conclusive on the question of the applicability of the [antitrust 
laws], does constitute a warning against treating the defendants' conduct as though it amounted to a common-law trade 
restraint."" 365 U.S. at 136-37, 81 S. Ct. at 528-29. Second, the Court noted that finding liability for legitimate efforts to effect government ""would substantially impair the power of 
government to take actions through its legislative and executive that operate to restrain trade."" Id. at 137, 81 S. Ct. at 528. The 
nature of a representative government requires that the government act on behalf of the people, and to make representation 
work, requires that the people indicate their wishes to the government. Finally, the Noerr Court noted that finding liability for legitimate efforts to influence government would raise serious constitutional 
questions.  The right to petition government is guaranteed in the first amendment. Therefore, it cannot be infringed by a statute, 
and the court will not ""lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms."" Id. at 138, 81 S. Ct. at 530. The Court in Pennington was no more definite about the basis for the exception. The Trucking Unlimited Court continually spoke to the first amendment right to petition, while extending Noerr to attempts to 
influence courts and administrative bodies, i.e., ""The right of access to the court is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."" 
404 U.S. at 510, 92 S. Ct. at 611. ""Petitioners, of course, have the right of access to the agencies and courts to be heard on 
applications sought by competitive highway carriers. That right, as indicated, is part of the right of petition protected by the First 
Amendment."" Id. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613."
991,22," The existence of multiple suits will undoubtedly make it easier to prove that a party did not have the requisite legitimate intent 
to influence government that is necessary to invoke the first amendment protections of Noerr.  We are not, however, concerned 
here with the ultimate ability of a plaintiff to succeed at trial. Rather, we are concerned with a plaintiff's ability to avoid summary 
judgment. As to proof at trial, it is entirely conceivable that the requisite sham intent can be proven when there is only a single 
sham suit."
991,23," We recognize that the fraud and bribery mentioned in Trucking Unlimited do not involve the petitioning activity that is the heart 
of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  Defendants have not, however, presented any basis for finding this distinction relevant.  The "
992,," Trucking Unlimited Court itself treated the fraud and bribery as analogous to the sham petitioning activity for the purposes of 
antitrust liability."
992,24," In Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977), the Supreme Court was given the 
opportunity to decide whether the sham exception was applicable in a case in which only a single suit was involved.  The 
Supreme Court, in a three-opinion decision, avoided the question.  Vendo involved a federal litigant attempting to enjoin state 
litigation, on the grounds that the single state suit constituted an antitrust violation. A three-justice plurality opinion refused to 
enjoin the state suit, holding an injunction was improper under the anti-injunction statute.  The two-justice concurring opinion 
wrote that an injunction was improper because the single suit would not be sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the 
sham exception. Four dissenters wrote that the suit was not barred by the anti-injunction statute, and that a single claim was 
enough to constitute a cause of action under the sham exception. The dissent noted, as we noted above, that the Trucking 
Unlimited Court itself wrote that in certain cases single acts constituted antitrust violations.  Moreover, the dissent found no 
language in Trucking Unlimited which would bar a claim based on a single suit.  We are convinced by the dissent. Lower courts, in cases preceding Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., have split on whether repetitive suits are necessary to have 
an actionable antitrust violation. Compare Huron Valley Hosp., Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 466 F. Supp. 1301, 1314 (E.D.Mich.1979);

992,25," The commentators agree with this interpretation.  See Fischel, Antitrust Liability for Attempts to Influence Government Action: 
The Basis and Limits of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 80, 110 (1977) (""The touchstone of the traditional sham 
exception -- the absence of a genuine intent to influence the government -- suggests that although repeated lawsuits are highly 
probative, they are not necessary to constitute a sham."") (emphasis added); Balmer, Sham Litigation and the Antitrust Laws, 29 
Buffalo L.Rev. 39, 55-56 (1980) (""The 'pattern of baseless repetitive claims' language of California Motor Transport will be 
treated by some as making multiple sham suits a prerequisite for antitrust liability.  However, the better analyses will be those 
which look behind this language to the precedents relied upon in California Motor Transport and which, like Justice Stevens' 
dissent in Lektro-Vend, view those words as an 'illustration' of an antitrust violation and not a minimum standard.  The single 
sham suit can be a very significant restraint of trade or act in furtherance of monopolization, and it should be prohibited by the 
Sherman Act. More importantly, . . . the constitutional guarantee of the right of petition which underlies Noerr-Pennington 
immunity protects only legitimate suits and not sham litigation, whether that litigation consists of one knowingly baseless 
complaint or many."") Our view that a single sham action is sufficient is not inconsistent with the holding in Ad Visor, Inc. v. Pacific Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., 640 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1981). In Ad Visor, we stated ""Multiplicity, by itself, does not vitiate the Noerr-Pennington 
protections."" Id. at 1109. In support of this view, we relied upon the following language from Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Vendo Co. v. 
Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977): ""Since I believe that federal courts should be 
hesitant indeed to enjoin ongoing state court proceedings, I am of the opinion that a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims or 
some equivalent showing of grave abuse of the state courts must exist before an injunction would be proper."" 433 U.S. at 644 
(emphasis added). Thus, it is not the number of claims which is controlling, but whether the evidence shows that the claim or claims filed constitute 
an abuse of process.  Where the facts are in dispute, this is a question for the trier of fact. "
993,26," In the following cases, the Court indicated that sham claims were appropriate, even though access barring was absent.  See 
Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977) (all three opinions assume the filing of 
baseless lawsuits with the purpose of elimination of competition could constitute an antitrust violation) (""sham litigation in state 
courts may constitute an antitrust violation"") (plurality opinion) Id. at 635 n.6, 97 S. Ct. at 2889 n.6; (pattern of baseless repetitive 
claims may constitute antitrust violation) (concurring opinion) Id. at 643-44, 97 S. Ct. at 2893-94; (""illegal use of state court 
litigation as a method of monopolizing or restraining trade is . . . a violation of the antitrust laws"") (dissenting opinion) Id. at 653, 
97 S. Ct. at 2898; City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 405, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 1132, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 
(1978) (anticompetitive litigation in the courts can constitute antitrust violation); New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 
U.S. 96, 110 n.15, 99 S. Ct. 403, 412 n.15, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978) (""Dealers who press sham protests before the New Motor 
Vehicle Board for the sole purpose of delaying the establishment of competing dealerships may be vulnerable to suits under the 
federal antitrust laws""). "
994,27," Franchise Realty is very different from the instant case.  In Franchise Realty the defendants opposed plaintiffs' applications for 
building permits.  The body which acted on the permits was ""as much a political as an adjudicatory body."" 542 F.2d at 1079. The 
defendants were successful in their opposition.  Here, in contrast, the defendants opposed the plaintiff's applications in a pure 
adjudicatory body.  As the Trucking court noted, activity which is acceptable before a political body is not necessarily acceptable 
before an administrative or judicial body.  See 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613. Moreover, in the instant case, the defendants' 
protests uniformly failed. "
995,28," The commentators have also agreed with our interpretation. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, 354 (1978) (""Certainly, in a proper case, a proved intent not to bar competitors from the 
courtroom but, by the litigation of baseless claims, to bar them from a market or to delay their entry should suffice for a violation 
of the Sherman Act""); Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law para. 203b at 41 (1978) (""Because the would-be competitors [in Trucking 
Unlimited] had first to obtain a license from an administrative agency, the Court spoke of defendants' alleged misbehavior as 
revealing 'a purpose to deprive the competitors of meaningful access to the agencies and courts.' But harassment of rivals 
through administrative adjudication would seem equally reprehensible and anti-competitive whether or not the actual or potential 
rival would himself be obliged to seek a license to enter the market in question."")"
995,29," The defendants, in a footnote in their brief, also claim that the action for fraud is barred by the statute of limitations. Section 4B 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, provides the applicable four-year statute of limitations.  Defendants contend that the first 
fraud claim was asserted in an amended complaint six years after the alleged fraud occurred, and five years after the action was 
filed, and is accordingly barred by the four-year statute of limitations in the Clayton Act.  Even if we assumed the truth of all 
defendants' allegations, we would not agree with their conclusion that the fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: ""Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the 
amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original 
pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading."" HN17[
] Under the relation back doctrine of Rule"
995,15," (c), the allegations of a new theory in an amended complaint will not be time barred if the theory involves the same 
transaction, occurrence, or core of operative facts involved in the original claim.  See 3 Moore's Federal Practice para. 15.15[3], 
at 15-194 (3d ed. 1980); Wright & Miller, 6 Federal Practice and Procedure § 1496 (1971).  In the instant case, the initial 
complaint alleged antitrust violations involving the defendants' protests to the ICC.  The fraud claim in the amended complaint 
also alleged antitrust violations arising from the protests. The protests involve a single transaction or occurrence.  Therefore, the 
claims involving fraud relate back to the filing of the first complaint, and are not time barred. We are mindful that the relation back doctrine of Rule 15(c) is to be liberally applied.  Moreover, as recognized by the Fifth 
Circuit: ""This liberality is particularly persuasive in antitrust suits where there is ample opportunity for discovery and other pretrial 
procedures."" Woods Exploration & Producing Co., Inc. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1300 (5th Cir. 1971), 
cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972). Here, the initial complaint clearly put defendants on notice that their conduct involving the protests was being challenged in 
court; the purposes of the statute of limitations were satisfied.  In the absence of any evidence of prejudice to defendants caused 
by the late filing of the fraud claim, there is no reason to find it time barred."
995,30," 49 U.S.C. § 15a(3), recodified as 49 U.S.C. § 10704(d), provides: HN18[
] In a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation . . . the Commission, 
in determining whether a rate is lower than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances 
attending the movement of the traffic by the carrier or carriers to which the rate is applicable.  Rates of a carrier shall not be "
996,," held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation, giving due consideration to the 
objectives of the national transportation policy . . . . HN19[
] Section 15a(3) has been held to require the protesting carrier mode to establish that it has the inherent cost 
advantage.  This may be shown by comparing fully allocated costs and establishing that the proposed rate is below protestants' 
fully allocated costs. See ICC v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 372 U.S. 744, 83 S. Ct. 1038, 10 L. Ed. 2d 108 
(1963); American Commercial Lines Inc., v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 392 U.S. 571, 88 S. Ct. 2105, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1289 
(1968)."
996,31," The Walker Process doctrine is not limited to fraud on the Patent Office.  The fact that Walker Process provides a rule of 
general applicability was intimated in Trucking Unlimited, in which Justice Douglas wrote that ""[misrepresentations], condoned in 
the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process."" 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613."
996,32," See, e.g., Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. v. Greyhound Corp., 555 F.2d 687, 696 (9th Cir. 1977), vacated and remanded on other 
grounds, 437 U.S. 322, 98 S. Ct. 2370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1978). The lengthy [jury] instructions contained two brief passages apparently inspired by Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food 
Machinery & Chemical Corp., . . . and California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited . . . .  Greyhound argues that 
these passages permitted imposition of liability if the jury found no more than that Greyhound had perpetrated a fraud on 
the Commission or had acted in bad faith in the administrative and related judicial processes, rendering those processes 
ineffective . . . .  At most . . . the only question raised by these passages is whether the doctrine of Walker Process applies 
outside the patent field. When the passages are read in light of the parties' contentions, the evidence in the case, and the instructions as a whole, 
however, we do not believe they present even this issue. (emphasis added) (citations omitted). "
997,33," Defendants also contend that Clipper's claim of fraud is refuted in the record, because the ICC began its investigation into 
Clipper's Tariff 55 before defendants made their fraudulent representations.  Even if this is true, the fraud may have resulted in a 
longer, more in depth, investigation.  We express no opinion here on the ultimate merits of the fraud claim.  We are holding here 
only that a cause of action for fraud is presented -- whether it can be proven is not our concern at this point. "
998,34," We note that in an amicus brief the ICC has urged us to find that deliberate misrepresentations of material facts to the ICC will 
make out an antitrust claim if other elements of an antitrust claim are present.  The ICC states that ""many government agencies 
the size of the [ICC] have only a small staff to monitor the actions of litigants and must rely on the parties to tell the truth.  Thus, 
a misrepresentation could go undetected unless another party who becomes aware of the wrongdoing comes forward and 
reports it to public authorities.  The incentive provided by treble damage recovery [of antitrust laws] would give parties a 
monetary inducement to bring to light such wrong-doing."" "
999,35," Rather, it is indicative only of the uneasy, but recurring, interplay between patent law, which authorizes monopolies, and 
antitrust law, which prohibits and punishes monopolies.  See Handgards, 601 F.2d at 992 n.10. "
1000,36," In their brief, defendants contend that Clipper's costs in defending against the protests were quite small, and they imply that 
because they were small, they are noncompensatory.  We are not here concerned with the amount of damage.  That is a 
question for the trier of fact.  Our sole concern is whether the theory on which damages are claimed is viable. "
1001,37," Defendants also contend that Clipper's damage claim is not compensable because Clipper caused its own injury by 
deliberately adopting a piecemeal filing strategy before the defendants undertook to protest. It is clear that the only antitrust 
damages that are recoverable are those which are caused by the defendants' illegal conduct.  See Kapp v. Nat'l Football 
League, 586 F.2d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1996, 60 L. Ed. 2d 375 (1979). This causation 
problem, however, is properly determined by the trier of fact.  Whether defendants' acts damaged Clipper, and the extent of that 
damage, is not before us at this time. The defendants also contend that because RMMTB and not the individual motor carrier defendants filed the protests, only 
RMMTB could have any liability.  The defendants contend that for a member of an association to be liable for an association's 
acts in violation of antitrust laws the member must have ""knowingly, intentionally and actively participated in an individual 
capacity in the scheme."" Kline v. Coldwell, Banker & Co., 508 F.2d 226, 232. The liability of the individual defendants is not now before this court.  Our sole concern at this time is whether a triable cause of 
action is stated.  If so, it will be up to the trier of fact to determine, under the applicable law, which defendants are liable, and the 
extent of that liability. "
1002,38," See, e.g., Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1973) (when agency 
(CAB) had power to approve monopolistic practice and did in fact approve the practice, no antitrust action would lie); Far East 
Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 72 S. Ct. 492, 96 L. Ed. 576 (1952) (when challenged conference agreement had 
been approved by U.S. Shipping Board under authority of Shipping Act of 1916, no antitrust action based on challenge to 
conference agreement would lie).  See also United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., 284 U.S. 474, 52 S. Ct. 247, 76 L.

1005,7," It should be noted that the fact that a party successfully establishes that the Noerr-Pennington exception is inapplicable does 
not entitle it to a judgment. Such a showing would merely establish that defendant's conduct was subject to the antitrust laws. 
""The absence of an immunity does not itself establish an antitrust offense. To prevail, the plaintiff must demonstrate that any 
non-immune behavior meets the standard tests defining an antitrust violation."" Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law § 201 (1978)."
1005,8," Because we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for a trial on the merits, we need not determine whether the 
district court judge acted properly in denying Clipper's 59(e) motion to vacate and reconsider. "
1006,9," Rule 59(e) provides that ""a motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the 
judgment."" See Pacific Maritime Ass'n v. Quinn, 465 F.2d 108, 109 n.1 (1972) (service, not filing, tolls the running of time to file 
notice of appeal). Clipper served its 59(e) motion on August 10, 1978, after a July 31, 1978 entry of judgment. Thus, under the 
rules of time computations provided in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this motion was served within the time 
strictures established in 59(e)."
1006,10," Rule 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states: ""When a motion is supported by affidavit, the affidavit shall be served 
with the motion…."" If, as here, a motion is complete without supporting affidavits, there is no reason to determine whether 
compliance with this filing requirement is jurisdictional when the affidavits are necessary to make the motion complete. We note, 
however, the position of the Seventh Circuit in Schy v. Susquehanna Corp., 419 F.2d 1112 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 826, 
91 S. Ct. 51, 27 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1970). In Schy the Seventh Circuit held that when the plaintiff did not complain of untimeliness of filing affidavits at the district court 
level, any objection based on that untimeliness was waived on appeal. Id. at 1116. It is questionable whether any proper 
objection to the untimeliness of these affidavits was raised at trial. Clearly, the defendant-appellees did not object to the late 
filing of the affidavits. They commented only that the affidavits came too late to substantively oppose the summary judgment. 
That is irrelevant to the 59(e) motion. A defendant who is not a party to this appeal questioned the timeliness of the affidavits 
under Rule 59(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 59(c) relates to filing affidavits to support a motion for new trial, 
and does not apply to a 59(e) motion. Because we hold, however, that the 59(e) motion was complete without the affidavits we need not determine whether the 59(c) 
assertion was sufficient to preserve the question of timeliness for appeal. "
1007,11," The defendants cite Durkin v. Taylor. 444 F. Supp. 879, 889-90 (E.D.Va. 1977); Erickson Tool Co. v. Balas Collet Co., 277 F. 
Supp. 226, 234 (N.D.Ohio 1967). aff'd, 404 F.2d 35 (6th Cir. 1968); Chastain v. Kelley, 167 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 510 F.2d 1232, 
1238 n.7 (D.C.Cir. 1975), for the proposition that a 59(e) motion is not proper if it advances no new grounds in seeking to vacate 
a judgment. None of these cases involved the question of whether the motion tolled the running of time to file notice of appeal. 
All were concerned with whether the motion should have been granted. That is not at issue here. Furthermore, the position of 
these cases, in holding that a 59(e) motion must raise new grounds, is questionable. There is much authority to the contrary. 
See Dove v. Codesco, 569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978); Sonnenblick Goldman Corp. v. Norwalk, 420 F.2d 858, 859 (3d Cir. 
1970); Parks v. ""Mr. Ford"" 68 F.R.D. 305 (E.D.Pa.1975)."
1007,12," This Circuit, in determining whether a motion for a new trial was timely, noted in dictum: ""It is true that the motion for an 
extension of time within which to file a motion for new trial stated no grounds for which a new trial would be sought; but the fact 
that this motion, considered as an inartfully drawn motion for new trial was so defective that it could not properly be granted, 
would not serve to render it non-existent. This court has held that in order to suspend the running of the 30-day appeal period 
allowed by Rule 73(a) a motion for new trial need not be granted or even grantable."" Yanow v. Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co., 274 
F.2d 274, 283 (9th Cir. 1959) (en banc) cert denied 362 U.S. 919, 80 S. Ct. 671, 4 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1960). Under this liberal approach Clipper's motion was clearly sufficient to toll the time for filing a Notice of Appeal. "
1008,13," Because we hold that the record before the trial judge at the time the summary judgment was granted did not support that 
judgment, we need not consider the late filed affidavits in reaching our holding. Therefore, defendants' contention that the late 
filed affidavits could not be used to support reversal of summary judgment need not be considered."
1008,14," Ordinarily, the proper mode of testing the legal sufficiency of the allegations of a complaint is by way of a motion to dismiss for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Such a motion can be made at any 
time, and normally will be made before any substantial discovery has been conducted. However, where, as here, evidence 
outside the record is submitted to and not excluded by the district court, any such motion must be disposed of by way of the 
summary judgment procedures specified in Rule 56(c). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)."
1008,15," In a short order granting RMMTB's motion for summary judgment, the district court held: (1) Clipper's ""claim, insofar as it is 
based on defendants' protests before the Interstate Commerce Commission, is barred by the . . . Noerr-Pennington doctrine. 
""Plaintiff's attempt to invoke the 'sham' exception to that immunity . . . is . . . foreclosed by the narrow reading of that exception 
announced in Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v. San Francisco Local Joint Executive Board of Culinary Workers. . . ."" The "
1009,," district court continued: ""Furthermore, plaintiff's damage claims, which rest on assumptions as to action that would have been 
taken by the ICC in the absence of defendant's alleged antitrust violations are barred by Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. . . ."" 
The district court order did not individually consider the viability of the theories alleging that the furnishing of fraudulent 
information constituted an antitrust violation and that the protest was simply part of an independent antitrust violation."
1009,16," An analysis of cases dealing with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is subject to the following caveat: Each case arising under the Sherman Act must be determined upon the particular facts disclosed by the record, and that 
the opinions in those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the essential differences in 
the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to which the rule of earlier decisions is to be applied."" Maple 
Flooring Mfrs. Ass'n v. United States, 268 U.S. 563, 579, 69 L. Ed. 1093, 45 S. Ct. 578 [268 U.S. 563, 45 S. Ct. 578, 583, 
69 L. Ed. 1093] (1925). "
1010,17," Yet unethical conduct in the setting of the adjudicatory process often results in sanctions. Perjury of witnesses is one example. 
Use of a patent obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor from the market may involve a violation of the antitrust laws, as we 
held in Walker Process Equipment v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 175-77, 86 S. Ct. 347, 349-50, 15 L. Ed. 
2d 247. Conspiracy with a licensing authority to eliminate a competitor may also result in an antitrust transgression. Continental 
Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 707, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1414, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777; Harman v. Valley National 
Bank, 339 F.2d 564 (CA 9 1964). Similarly, bribery of a public purchasing agent may constitute a violation of § 2(c) of the 
Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. Rangen Inc. v. Sterling Nelson & Sons, 351 F.2d 851 (CA 9 1965). There are many other forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes and 
which may result in antitrust violations. Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the 
adjudicatory process. Opponents before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other's tactics, motions, or defenses and 
may readily call them baseless. One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of 
baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes 
have been abused. That may be a difficult line to discern and draw. But once it is drawn, the case is established that abuse of 
those processes produced an illegal result, viz., effectively barring respondents from access to the agencies and courts. Insofar 
as the administrative or judicial processes are involved, actions of that kind cannot acquire immunity by seeking refuge under the 
umbrella of ""political expression."" 404 U.S. at 512-13, 92 S. Ct. at 613. "
1011,18," The district court wrote: ""The repetitive use of litigation by Otter Tail was timed and designed principally to prevent the 
establishment of municipal electric systems and thereby to preserve defendant's monopoly"" . . . the litigation comes within the 
sham exception to the Noerr doctrine as defined by the Supreme Court in California Transport. . . ."" 360 F. Supp. at 451-52. "
1012,19," Whether defendants' protests constitute one or multiple claims is a matter of interpretation. There is one basic tariff--Tariff 55--
involved here. During the course of the investigation, however, Tariff 55 was modified by Clipper many times. After each 
modification the defendants lodged a new protest. Each protest was necessary to preserve the initial protest, or else the newly 
revised Tariff 55 would go into effect, mooting the prior protest. Whether this constitutes one or multiple claims is unclear. We 
need not reach that question because we find the sham exception applicable even if there is only a single claim involved."
1012,20," The conduct which the Trucking Unlimited Court held to fall within the sham exception constituted a pattern of repetitive 
claims. The defendant highway carriers in Trucking Unlimited continually instituted state and federal proceedings to defeat 
applications by other highway carriers to acquire operating rights or to transfer or register those rights. In holding that a cause of 
action under the sham exception was stated, the Court referred to a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims [which] may emerge 
[and lead] the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial process have been abused."" 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. 
at 613."
1012,21," Noerr advanced at least three arguments for the exception, but did not clearly adopt any. First, the Court noted that there is an 
""essential dissimilarity"" between agreements to seek government action and those agreements traditionally condemned by the 
antitrust laws. This essential dissimilarity, ""even if not itself conclusive on the question of the applicability of the (antitrust laws], 
does constitute a warning against treating the defendants' conduct as though it amounted to a common-law trade restraint."" 365 
U.S. at 136-37, 81 S. Ct. at 528-29. Second, the Court noted that finding liability for legitimate efforts to effect government ""would substantially impair the power of 
government to take actions through its legislative and executive that operate to restrain trade."" Id. at 137, 81 S. Ct. at 528. The 
nature of a representative government requires that the government act on behalf of the people, and to make representation 
work, requires that the people indicate their wishes to the government. Finally, the Noerr Court noted that finding liability for legitimate efforts to influence government would, raise serious constitutional 
questions. The right to petition government is guaranteed in the first amendment. Therefore; it cannot be infringed by a statute, 
and the court will not ""lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms."" Id. at 138, 81 S. Ct. at 530. The Court in Pennington was no more definite about the basis for the exception. The Trucking Unlimited Court continually spoke to the first amendment right to petition, while extending Noerr to attempts to 
influence courts and administrative bodies, i.e., ""The right of access to the court is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."" 
404 U.S. at 510, 92 S. Ct. at 611. ""Petitioners, of course, have the right of access to the agencies and courts to be heard on 
applications sought by competitive highway carriers. That right, as indicated, is part of the right of petition protected by the First 
Amendment."" Id. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613. "
1013,22," The existence of multiple suits will undoubtedly make it easier to prove that a party did not have the requisite legitimate intent 
to influence government that is necessary to invoke the first amendment protections of Noerr. We are not, however, concerned 
here with the ultimate ability of a plaintiff to succeed at trial. Rather, we are concerned with a plaintiff's ability to avoid summary 
judgment. As to proof at trial, it is entirely conceivable that the requisite sham intent can be proven when there is only a single 
sham suit."
1013,23," We recognize that the fraud and bribery mentioned in Trucking Unlimited do not involve the petitioning activity that is the heart 
of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Defendants have not, however, presented any basis for finding this distinction relevant. The 
Trucking Unlimited Court itself treated the fraud and bribery as analogous to the sham petitioning activity for the purposes of 
antitrust liability."
1013,24," In Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977), the Supreme Court was given the 
opportunity to decide whether the sham exception was applicable in a case in which only a single suit was involved. The 
Supreme Court, in a three-opinion decision avoided the question. Vendo involved a federal litigant attempting to enjoin state 
litigation on the grounds that the single state suit constituted an antitrust violation. A three-justice plurality opinion refused to 
enjoin the state suit, holding an injunction was improper under the anti-injunction statute. The two-justice concurring opinion 
wrote that an injunction was improper because the single suit would not be sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the 
sham exception. Four dissenters wrote that the suit was not barred by the anti-injunction statute, and that a single claim was 
enough to constitute a cause of action under the sham exception. The dissent noted, as we noted above, that the Trucking 
Unlimited Court itself wrote that in certain cases single acts constituted antitrust violations. Moreover, the dissent found no 
language in Trucking Unlimited which would bar a claim based on a single suit. We are convinced by the dissent. Lower courts, in cases preceding Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., have split on whether repetitive suits are necessary to have 
an actionable antitrust violation. Compare Huron Valley Hosp., Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 466 F. Supp. 1301, 1314 (E.D.Mich.1979);

1013,25," The commentators agree with this interpretation. See Fischel, Antitrust Liability for Attempts to Influence Government Action: 
The Basis and Limits of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 80, 110 (1977) (The touchstone of the traditional sham 
exception--the absence of a genuine intent to influence the government--suggests that although repeated lawsuits are highly 
probative, they are not necessary to constitute a sham."") (emphasis added); Balmer, Sham Litigation and the Antitrust Laws, 29 "
1014,," Buffalo L.Rev. 39, 55-56 (1980) (""The 'pattern of baseless repetitive claims' language of California Motor Transport will be 
treated by some as making multiple sham suits a prerequisite for antitrust liability. However, the better analyses will be those 
which look behind this language to the precedents relied upon in California Motor Transport and which, like Justice Stevens' 
dissent in Lektro-Vend, view those words as an 'illustration' of an antitrust violation and not a minimum standard. The single 
sham suit can be a very significant restraint of trade or act in furtherance of monopolization, and it should be prohibited by the 
Sherman Act. More importantly, . . . the constitutional guarantee of the right of petition which underlies Noerr-Pennington 
immunity protects only legitimate suits and not sham litigation, whether that litigation consists of one knowingly baseless 
complaint or many."") Our view that a single sham action is sufficient is not inconsistent with the holding in Ad Visor, Inc. v. Pacific Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., 640 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1981). In Ad Visor, we stated ""Multiplicity by itself, does not vitiate the Noerr-Pennington 
protections."" Id. at 1109. In support of this view, we relied upon the following language from Justice Blackman's concurring opinion in Vendo Co. v. 
Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 1009 (1977): Since I believe that federal courts should be hesitant 
indeed to enjoin ongoing state court proceedings, I am of the opinion that a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims or some 
equivalent showing of grave abuse of the state courts must exist before an injunction would be proper."" 433 U.S. at 644. 
(emphasis added). Thus, it is not the number of claims which is controlling, but whether the evidence shows that the claim or claims filed constitute 
an abuse of process. Where the facts are in dispute, this is a question for the trier of fact. "
1015,26," In the following cases, the Court indicated that sham claims were appropriate, even though access barring was absent. See 
Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977) (all three opinions assume the filing of 
baseless lawsuits with the purpose of elimination of competition could constitute an antitrust violation) (""sham litigation in state 
courts may constitute an antitrust violation"") (plurality opinion) Id. at 635 n.6, 97 S. Ct. at 2889 n.6; (pattern of baseless repetitive 
claims may constitute antitrust violation) (concurring opinion) Id. at 643-44, 97 S. Ct. at 2893-94, (""illegal use of state court 
litigation as a method of monopolizing or restraining trade is . . . a violation of the anti trust laws"") (dissenting opinion) Id. at 653, 
97 S. Ct. at 2898; City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 405, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 1132, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 
(1978) (anticompetitive litigation in the courts can constitute antitrust violation); New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 
U.S. 96, 110 n.15, 99 S. Ct. 403, 412 n.15, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978) (""Dealers who press sham protests before the New Motor 
Vehicle Board for the sole purpose of delaying the establishment of competing dealerships may be vulnerable to suits under the 
federal antitrust laws""). "
1016,27," Franchise Realty is very different from the instant case. In Franchise Realty the defendants opposed plaintiffs' applications for 
building permits. The body which acted on the permits was ""as much a political as an adjudicatory body."" 542 F.2d at 1079. The 
defendants were successful in their opposition. Here, in contrast, the defendants opposed the plaintiff's applications in a pure 
adjudicatory body. As the Trucking court noted, activity which is acceptable before a political body is not necessarily acceptable 
before an administrative or judicial body. See 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613. Moreover, in the instant case, the defendants' 
protests uniformly failed."
1016,28," The commentators have also agreed with our interpretation. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, 354 (1978) (""Certainly, in a proper case, a proved intent not to bar competitors from 
the courtroom but, by the litigation of baseless claims, to bar them from a market or to delay their entry should suffice for a 
violation of the Sherman Act"") Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law P 203b at 41 (1978) (""Because the would-be competitors [in 
Trucking Unlimited] had first to obtain a license from an administrative agency, the Court spoke of defendants' alleged 
misbehavior, as revealing 'a purpose to deprive the competitors of meaningful access to the agencies and courts.' But 
harassment of rivals through administrative adjudication would seem equally reprehensible and anti-competitive whether or 
not the actual or potential rival would himself be obliged to seek a license to enter the market in question."")"
1016,29," The defendants, in a footnote in their brief, also claim that the action for fraud is barred by the statute of limitations. Section 4B 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, provides the applicable four-year statute of limitations. Defendants contend that the first 
fraud claim was asserted in an amended complaint six years after the alleged fraud occurred, and five years after the action was 
filed, and is accordingly barred by the four-year statute of limitations in the Clayton Act. Even if we assumed the truth of all 
defendants' allegations, we would not agree with their conclusion that the fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations. "
1017,," Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: ""Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the 
amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original 
pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading."" Under the relation back doctrine of Rule 15(c), the 
allegations of a new theory in an amended complaint will not be time barred if the theory involves the same transaction, 
occurrence, or core of operative facts involved in the original claim. See 3 Moore's Federal Practice P 15.15[3], at 15-194 (3d ed. 
1980); Wright & Miller, 6 Federal Practice and Procedure § 1496 (1971). In the instant case, the initial complaint alleged antitrust 
violations involving the defendants' protests to the ICC. The fraud claim in the amended complaint also alleged antitrust 
violations arising from the protests. The protests involve a single transaction or occurrence. Therefore, the claims involving fraud 
relate back to the filing of the first complaint, and are not time barred. We are mindful that the relation back doctrine of Rule 15(c) is to be liberally applied. Moreover, as recognized by the Fifth 
Circuit: ""This liberality is particularly persuasive in antitrust suits where there is ample opportunity for discovery and other pretrial 
procedures."" Woods Exploration & Producing Co., Inc., v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1300 (5th Cir. 1971) 
cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972). Here, the initial complaint clearly put defendants on notice that their conduct involving the protests was being challenged in 
court; the purposes of the statute of limitations were satisfied. In the absence of any evidence of prejudice to defendants caused 
by the late filing of the fraud claim, there is no reason to find it time barred."
1017,30," 49 U.S.C. § 15a(3), recodified as 49 U.S.C. § 10704(d), provides: In a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation . . . the Commission, in 
determining whether a rate is lower than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances attending 
the movement of the traffic by the carrier or carriers to which the rate is applicable. Rates of a carrier shall not be held up to 
a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation, giving due consideration to the objectives of the 
national transportation policy. . . . Section 15a(3) has been held to require the protesting carrier mode to establish that it has the inherent cost advantage. This 
may be shown by comparing fully allocated costs and establishing that the proposed rate is below protestants' fully allocated 
costs. See ICC v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 372 U.S. 744, 83 S. Ct. 1038, 10 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1963); 
American Commercial Lines Inc. v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 392 U.S. 571, 88 S. Ct. 2105, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1289 (1968)."
1017,31," The Walker Process doctrine is not limited to fraud on the Patent Office. The fact that Walker Process provides a rule of 
general applicabiity was intimated in Trucking Unlimited, in which Justice Douglas wrote that ""misrepresentations, condoned in 
the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process."" 404 U.S. at 513, 92 S. Ct. at 613. "
1018,32," See e.g., Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. v. Greyhound Corp., 555 F.2d 687, 696 (9th Cir. 1977), vacated and remanded on other 
grounds, 437 U.S. 322, 98 S. Ct. 2370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1978). The lengthy [jury] instructions contained two brief passages apparently inspired by Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food 
Machinery & Chemical Corp., . . . and California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited . . . . Greyhound argues that 
these passages permitted imposition of liability if the jury found no more than that Greyhound had perpetrated a fraud on 
the Commission or had acted in bad faith in the administrative and related judicial processes, rendering those processes 
ineffective. . . . At most . . . the only question raised by these passages is whether the doctrine of Walker Process applies 
outside the patent field. When the passages are read in light of the parties' contentions, the evidence in the case, and the instructions as a whole, 
however, we do not believe they present even this issue. (emphasis added) (citations omitted)."
1018,33," Defendants also contend that Clipper's claim of fraud is refuted in the record, because the ICC began its investigation into 
Clipper's Tariff 55 before defendants made their fraudulent representations. Even if this is true, the fraud may have resulted in a 
longer, more in depth, investigation. We express no opinion here on the ultimate merits of the fraud claim. We are holding here 
only that a cause of action for fraud is presented--whether it can be proven is not our concern at this point. "
1019,34," We note that in an amicus brief the ICC has urged us to find that deliberate misrepresentations of material facts to the ICC will 
make out an antitrust claim if other elements of an antitrust claim are present. The ICC states that ""many government agencies 
the size of the [ICC] have only a small staff to monitor the actions 'of litigants and must rely on the parties to tell the truth. Thus, a 
misrepresentation could go undetected unless another party who becomes aware of the wrongdoing comes forward and reports 
it to public authorities. The incentive provided by treble damage recovery [of antitrust laws] would give parties a monetary 
inducement to bring to light such wrongdoing."" "
1021,35," Rather, it is indicative only of the uneasy, but recurring, interplay between patent law, which authorizes monopolies, and 
antitrust law, which prohibits and punishes monopolies. See Handgards, 601 F.2d at 992 n.10. "
1022,36," In their brief, defendants contend that Clipper's costs in defending against the protests were quite small, and they imply that 
because they were small, they are noncompensatory. We are not here concerned with the amount of damage. That is a question 
for the trier of fact. Our sole concern is whether the theory on which damages are claimed is viable."
1022,37," Defendants also contend that Clipper's damage claim is not compensable because Clipper caused its own injury by 
deliberately adopting a piecemeal filing strategy before the defendants undertook to protest. It is clear that the only antitrust 
damages that are recoverable are those which are caused by the defendants' illegal conduct. See Kapp v. Nat'l Football League, 
586 F.2d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1996, 60 L. Ed. 2d 375 (1979). This causation problem, 
however, is properly determined by the trier of fact. Whether defendants' acts damaged Clipper, and the extent of that damage, 
is not before us at this time. The defendants also contend that because RMMTB and not the individual motor carrier defendants filed the protests, only 
RMMTB could have any liability. The defendants contend that for a member of an association to be liable for an association's 
acts in violation of antitrust laws the member must have ""knowingly, intentionally and actively participated in an individual 
capacity in the scheme."" Kline v. Coldwell, Banker & Co., 508 F.2d 226, 232. The liability of the individual defendants is not now before this court. Our sole concern at this time is whether a triable cause of 
action is stated. If so, it will be up to the trier of fact to determine, under the applicable law, which defendants are liable, and the 
extent of that liability. "
1023,38," See, e.g., Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1973) (when agency 
(CAB) had power to approve monopolistic practice and did in fact approve the practice, no antitrust action would lie); Far East 
Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 72 S. Ct. 492, 96 L. Ed. 576 (1952) (when challenged conference agreement had 
been approved by U.S. Shipping Board under authority of Shipping Act of 1916, no antitrust action based on challenge to 
conference agreement would lie). See also United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., 284 U.S. 474, 52 S. Ct. 247, 76 L.

1048,6," .  Defendant urges that Section 2103 of the Health Care Financial Administration Provider Reimbursement Manual authorizes 
hospital group purchasing and exempts hospital group vendors from the antitrust laws.  Section 2103, in pertinent part provides: ""2103. PRUDENT BUYER A. General.-The prudent and cost-conscious buyer not only refuses to pay more than the going price for an item or service, he 
also seeks to economize by minimizing cost.  This is especially so when the buyer is an institution or organization which makes 
bulk purchases and can, therefore, often gain discounts because of the size of its purchases.  In addition, bulk purchase of items 
or services often gives the buyer leverage in bargaining with suppliers for other items or services.  Any alert and cost-conscious 
buyer seeks such advantages, and it is expected that Medicare providers of services will also seek them. B. Application of Prudent Buyer Principle.-Intermediaries may employ various means for detecting and investigating situations in 
which costs seem excessive.  Included may be such techniques as comparing the prices paid by providers to the prices paid for 
similar items or services by comparable purchasers, spotchecking, and querying providers about indirect, as well as direct, 
discounts. In addition, where a group of institutions has a joint purchasing arrangement which seems to result in participating 
members getting lower prices because of the advantages gained from bulk purchasing, any potentially eligible providers in the 
area which do not participate in the group may be called upon to justify any higher prices paid.  Also, when most of the costs of a 
service are reimbursed by Medicare (for a home health agency which treats only Medicare beneficiaries, for example), the costs 
should be examined with particular care.  In those cases where an intermediary notes that a provider pays more than the going 
price for a supply or service, in the absence of clear justification for the premium, the intermediary will exclude excess costs in 
determining allowable costs under Medicare."" "
1050,7," .  The AHSC-VHA Purchasing Agreement (PX 1) records the name, location and size of the member VHA hospitals as follows:"

procedures. The terms primary, secondary and tertiary care were used by several witnesses to describe the degree of health 
care delivered by VHA hospitals.  Primary care is basically general health care relating to simple or common illnesses, which 
involve the hospital's direct contact with a patient.  Secondary care involves medical specialists such as cardiologists, urologists 
or dermatologists who do not necessarily directly treat a patient.  Tertiary care involves the delivery of health care services by 
highly-specialized providers such as thoracic surgeons or neurosurgeons and may involve the use of highly-sophisticated 
equipment.  See, Institute of Health Planning Book of Definitions: A Glossary of Health Care Delivery and Planning Terms, 
August, 1981, at pages 31, 35 and 38. "
1053,9," .  Hospital inventory cost control requires the balancing of two cross cutting costs: order cost and inventory holding costs.  Order 
costs can be minimized by ordering infrequently and holding a large inventory. Inventory costs can be minimized by frequent 
reordering and maintaining a small inventory. The optimal balance between these conflicting costs is the economic order 
quantity (EOQ).  (T 2958) The EOQ is that product quantity which allows the hospital to carry the smallest inventory which incurs 
the lowest reorder cost. The interval at which the EOQ is ordered is termed the reorder point (ROP).  The ROP is that point in 
the inventory depletion when a new order must be entered so as to have a new shipment of supplies arrive as inventory on hand 
is exhausted.  The ROP is dependent on the hospital's consumption rate of particular products and the lead time of the 
distributor. Lead time is the time that elapses between the hospital's placement of the order and receipt of the products. The 
shorter the lead time, the lower the hospital can allow its inventory to dip before the reorder point is reached.  Thus, quick 
distribution allows a hospital to deplete its inventory to low levels before reorder. In this manner efficient distribution service allows the hospital to transfer much of the task of carrying an inventory to the hospital 
supply vendors. Consequently, the hospital can maintain a smaller, less costly in-house inventory. (T 4958-59) "
1063,10," .  In pursuing the attempt to monopolize claim, plaintiffs have submitted evidence to define the relevant product and geographic 
markets in order to calculate defendant's market share and to assess the dangerous probability of success incident to "
1064,," defendant's anticompetitive conduct.  In addition to this proof, plaintiffs suggest that a precise market definition and an 
independent conclusion on the dangerous probability issue is unnecessary in light of Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Company, 327 F.2d 
459 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993, 84 S. Ct. 1920, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1964). In Lessig, the Ninth Circuit held that in an attempt to monopolize claim, the definition of a relevant product market ""is not in 
issue"" since Section 2 prohibits attempts to monopolize ""any"" part of commerce.  Lessig, supra at 474. Similarly, the Lessig court 
rejected traditional thinking that a dangerous probability of success is an independent element to attempt to monopolize.  Cf.  
Swift and Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 393, 25 S. Ct. 276, 277, 49 L. Ed. 518 (1905). Instead the Lessig court regarded 
an attempt to monopolize claim to require only a showing of defendant's specific intent to monopolize.  The objective evaluation 
of defendant's dangerous probability of successful monopolization was considered relevant only as circumstantial evidence of 
specific intent.  Lessig, supra at 474. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States v. Dairymen, Inc., 660 F.2d 192 (6th Cir. 1981), noted that dangerous 
probability of success remains a required element of a Section 2 attempt claim.  The court also noted that where evidence 
relating to an antitrust market is ambiguous, the trial court is obligated to consider the possibility of antitrust product submarkets 
in evaluating an attempt claim.  Apparently the Dairymen decision implicitly rejects the reasoning adopted in Lessig.  Accordingly 
the court will require that plaintiffs define an antitrust product market or submarket and establish defendant's dangerous 
probability of success in order to prevail on their attempt to monopolize claim. "
1069,11," .  Apparently winter distribution of parenteral solutions requires a heated truck to prevent the solution from freezing.  The trucks 
of distributors of other kinds of hospital supplies need not be heated. "
1072,12," .  Defendant's Ohio Valley market shown in map DX 464 is a composite of sales maps for the three plaintiff firms. (Crocker-
Fels: DX 242-246; Ransdell: DX 185 and Skyland: DX 201) These maps represent the maximum sales area of each plaintiff; that 
is, the total geographic area by states, counties and cities in which each plaintiff sells and exerts sales efforts in an attempt to 
sell its products.  (Defendant's Interrogatory 5e to which plaintiffs' maps respond.) "
1077,13," .  Plaintiffs' market sales volume analysis assumes a product market of the distribution of medical-surgical supplies and a 
geographic market defined in terms of the eight SMSAs.  Defendant proffers several market volume sales analyses.  Some 
assume a broader product definition consisting of medical-surgical supplies, laboratory supplies and parenteral solutions.  Some 
of defendant's market volume analysis also assumes a broader defined geographic market consisting of the Michigan and Ohio 
Valley regions. Consistent with the court's prior determination that the relevant product market is the distribution of medical-
surgical supplies and that the relevant geographic submarkets are these eight SMSAs, the court will consider only those market 
sales volume analyses which reflect these product and geographic assumptions. "
1078,14," .  Federal hospitals are not analyzed by the IMS survey.  This is because the IMS study is intended to measure purchasing 
habits of acute care hospitals.  Many federal hospitals are veterans hospitals or tuberculosis care facilities.  As such, these 
institutions are chronic and not acute care health facilities. "
1079,15," .  Evidently the failure to allow for the development of new products and the tendency toward product upgrading not only 
understates the quantities of supplies purchased by hospitals, it may also understate the inflation rate for such hospital supplies. 
The inflation index Dr. Martin used from 1974 to 1979 was developed by IMS and reflects inflation in price of a fixed ""market 
basket"" of hospital supplies.  Dr. Armbruster opined that new products, not included in the ""market basket,"" may rise at a faster 
rate of inflation.  Thus, the overall rate for medical-surgical supplies may be higher than that reflected in the IMS inflation index.  
(T 10351)"
1079,16," .  The following suppliers were treated inconsistently within the three VHA purchases analyses: Bentley Laboratory, Malkin 
Instruments, Olympus Corporation, Richards, Inc., Edward Weck and Co., Cobe Laboratories, Extracorporeal, Medtronics and 
Physio-Control. (Compare DX 579, PX 590, 618) "
1081,17," .  More specifically, the Armbruster potential for each IMS size class is multiplied by the number of hospital beds in SMSA 
hospitals in each IMS size class.  The result is a dollar purchase figure for the SMSA hospitals in each size class.  All of these 
size class purchase figures are added to obtain the total dollar purchase figure for all hospitals in the SMSA.  This is the market 
sales volume."
1081,18," .  AHSC corporate sales in each SMSA were calculated by defendant's expert witness, Mr. Hepp, and appear in his work 
papers at DX 629 D-2. "
1086,19," .  That each VHA hospital will inevitably purchase among several product categories under the Purchasing Agreement seems 
evident for several reasons.  First, in many product submarkets if the VHA hospital bought its entire requirement from AHSC, 
these purchases would fall short of the volume discount price cap thresholds. Compare: "
1087,20," .  That AHSC agreed to ""be competitive"" in its pricing to the VHA hospitals does not mean that the defendant was acting 
competitively as that term is used in the antitrust law.  It is clear that a firm which fixes prices cannot justify its conduct by proof 
that prices were fixed at competitive levels.  See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. 
Ed. 1129, rehearing denied, 310 U.S. 658, 60 S. Ct. 1091, 84 L. Ed. 1421 (1940). Similarly, AHSC's anticompetitive trade "
1088,," practices cannot be justified by proof that they result in prices which competition would affirm.  The antitrust laws protect the 
competitive process and not merely low price levels which may be the fruits of competition or a benevolent monopolist. "
1091,21, .  General Medical Company is now owned by Whittaker Corp.  Will Ross is owned by G. D. Searle and Co. 
1097,22," .  Mr. Simmons' letter (PX 37) in pertinent part reads as follows: ""Although there would appear to be major philosophical differences between the structure of the VHA/AHSC agreement and the 
traditional group purchasing approach, … I think it eventually boils down to a matter of trust. (The Butterworth purchasing agent's) involvement with the Michigan Group Purchasing Program has reinforced in his mind the 
traditional group purchasing approach of putting all items out to bid, taking the lowest bid in each instance. While this approach has its benefits, it also has serious limitations which we have seen for several years.  Typically, it does not 
address the need for a systems approach to ordering, inventorying and distributing products to the point of end use, and it never 
gets beyond the adversary role between the buyer and seller, which creates a very ""suspicious' atmosphere. … our new agreement is unique.  The ""spirit' of cooperativeness attempts to get at some of the shortcomings of the traditional 
approach and hopefully will allow us to reach a position where we both ""win'. Through close cooperation, we will be able to seek cost efficiencies in each others operations which will allow us to produce and 
handle supplies more efficiently, allowing our mutual costs to come down. "
1098,," Much of what (the Butterworth purchasing agent) challenged in the agreement reflects his uneasiness with the ""partnership' 
approach to purchasing and materials management.  As I mentioned at our meeting, most of his questions will be answered in 
the next 18-24 months as we work together with each of the hospitals and scoreboard our activities…."" "
1099,23," .  Source: Hospitals, December 31, 1981, at page 34. "
1104,24," .  Even if competitively bid, a hospital group purchasing agreement which clearly defines a group price for a broad expanse of 
product lines may violate Section 3 of the Clayton Act as unlawful requirements or exclusive dealing arrangement. "
1109,25," .  Norton-Children's Hospitals have 492 beds and, therefore fall within the Armbruster size category of hospitals with a capacity 
of 300 to 499 beds. The 1980 Armbruster potential for an institution of this size is $ 3,308.  If Norton-Children's Hospitals had 
eight more beds, they would cross over into the next and largest IMS hospital size category of hospitals having 500 or more 
beds. In this larger size category, Norton-Children's would have a purchase potential of $ 3,644.  If AHSD's actual per-bed 
purchases at Norton-Children's are assessed against this higher Armbruster potential, defendant's sales amount to 30.35% of 
the total medical-surgical business at Norton-Children's. "
1124,1," .  Hirsh originally sought to bring this suit as a class action.  Based upon the stipulation of counsel, however, application for 
class action status was withdrawn until after trial on the issue of liability."
1124,2," .  Hirsh also contends that Martindale's sales practices violate § 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 2). That claim, however, is 
still pending before the court below and is not presently before us."
1124,3," .  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), the District Court determined there was no just cause for delay and directed entry of summary 
judgment on the claims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act. These claims are therefore properly before us 
despite the fact that Hirsh's claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act is still pending below. "
1125,4," .  The Directory also contains information regarding the ABA, certain uniform laws, and the statutory laws of certain jurisdictions."
1125,5," .  Martindale assigns letter values to attorneys based on information obtained from judges, other attorneys, and other sources in 
the community where the attorney practices.  The highest attainable rating is ""AV,"" with the ""A"" representing Martindale's 
evaluation of the attorney's legal skills and the ""V"" representing Martindale's evaluation of the attorney's ethics, reliability, and

1125,10," .  Informative cards contain information regarding the attorney or law firm such as the telephone number and zip code of the 
attorney or firm, names of partners and associates in the firm, areas of specialization, references, and representative clients."
1125,11," .  Areas of specialization, references, and lists of representative clients may appear in both the professional and informative 
cards."
1125,12," .  As noted below, certain classes of attorneys are exempted from the subscription requirement. "
1126,13," .  Hirsh also contends that these practices violate § 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 2). That claim, however, is not before us 
and we express no opinion regarding its merits.  See note 2 supra."
1126,14," .  The District Court also held that Hirsh's Clayton Act claim was barred because advertising is not a ""commodity."" See Clayton 
Act § 3 (15 U.S.C. § 14). Because we conclude that the advertising and the Directory are a single product, we need not consider 
the propriety of that ruling here."
1126,15," .  Our analysis here applies to both the requirement that purchasers of informative cards purchase the Directory and the 
requirement that purchasers of professional cards purchase the Directory. HN3[

1126,16," .  A minority of courts, however, require a showing of some sort of anticompetitive effect in the market for the tied product.  See, 
e.g., Driskill v. Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Inc., 498 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1974); Coniglio v. Highwood Services, Inc., 495 F.2d 
1286 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1022, 95 S. Ct. 498, 42 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1974). "
1127,17," .  HN4[
] Tie-ins differ from other per se illegal practices, however, in that, under certain circumstances, the tie may be legally 
justified.  See Dehydrating Process Co. v. A. O. Smith Corp., 292 F.2d 653 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 931, 82 S. Ct. 368, 7 
L. Ed. 2d 194 (1961). "
1128,18," .  Martindale's sales of advertising have increased steadily in the past.  According to at least one commentator, this is indicative 
of a pro-competitive effect in the market for legal advertising, the alleged tying product.  See Posner, The Next Step in the 
Antitrust Treatment of Restricted Distribution: Per Se Legality, 48 U.Chi.L.Rev. 6, 21 (1981)."
1128,19," .  Two additional reasons have been asserted in support of the antitrust law's harsh treatment of tying arrangements.  First, it 
has been argued that tying arrangements permit sellers with monopoly power in the tying product market to extend this 
monopoly power into a second market.  See, e.g., International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. at 396, 68 S. Ct. at 15. This, 
the so-called ""leverage theory,"" has been largely discredited by economists, primarily because modern economic thought 
indicates that all available monopoly profits could be obtained from the tying product alone without the use of a tie-in. See R. 
Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, 373 (1978).  Second, tying arrangements are disfavored because they intrude upon consumers' 
freedom of choice by compelling the purchase of unwanted products.  See, e.g., Moore v. James H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 
at 1212-13. This rationale has been implicitly rejected by the Supreme Court as a sufficient independent basis for antitrust 
liability.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 n.21, 58-59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2559 n.21, 2561-2562, 53 L. 
Ed. 2d 568."
1128,20," .  For a more complete discussion of how tying arrangements facilitate price discrimination, see Markovits, supra, 58 Texas 
L.Rev. at 1378-80."
1128,21," .  At least one commentator, however, has suggested that tying arrangements do not necessarily erect barriers to entry.  See 
Markovits, supra, 58 Texas L.Rev. 1363, 1419-22 (1980)."
1128,22," .  Hirsh places great weight on the fact that, under certain circumstances, Martindale sells the advertising and the Directory 
separately. Hirsh contends that these separate sales establish that the Directory and the advertising contained therein are 
separate products.  We disagree.  Martindale sells advertising separately only to foreign attorneys and attorneys sharing office "
1129,," space with a subscribing attorney.  Because foreign attorneys are less likely to refer legal work to domestic attorneys, and, 
because attorneys sharing office space with a subscribing attorney already have access to the Directory, application of the 
subscription requirement to them would serve no valid purpose.  Thus, Martindale's policy of excepting these attorneys from the 
subscription requirement constitutes a reasonable effort to limit application of the requirement to those situations where it would 
effectuate its underlying purpose.  We fail to see how such a limitation can render an otherwise permissible practice unlawful."
1129,23," .  Indeed, the facts of the present case are even stronger in support of a finding that no unlawful tying arrangement exists.  In 
Times-Picayune, the advertising appeared in two separate newspapers, an afternoon edition and a morning edition.  Thus, at 
least a plausible argument existed that there were separate markets involved.  In the present case, no such argument exists 
because both advertisements appear in the same Directory."
1129,24, .  The analysis here is identical to that employed above in evaluating the subscription requirement. 
1130,25," .  Nothing contained in this opinion is to be construed as expressing any view on the merits of Hirsh's pending claim under § 2 
of the Sherman Act. "
1153,1," At the time Associates and the other defendants filed this motion, they argued that Fairway's complaint must be asserted as a 
compulsory counterclaim to Associates' previously filed action for breach of contract (CV 81-3965). In apparent anticipation of 
success on that motion and a decision by this Court that the Fairway complaint be denominated as a counterclaim, Associates 
sought a ruling that any recovery for breach of warranty successfully asserted against it be limited as an offset to the amounts of 
the contracts assigned to it by Motorola and MCEI which it seeks to recover in its action against Fairway. As a result of this Court's decision to consolidate the actions, allowing each to retain its identity, Associates has altered slightly 
the nature of its motion to that set forth in the text of this opinion."
1153,2," The Donnelly Act, codified as section 340 of the New York General Business Law provides in pertinent part: § 340. Contracts or agreements for monopoly or in restraint of trade illegal and void"
1153,1," . Every contract, agreement, arrangement or combination whereby A monopoly in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state, is or may be

1156,4," See Leaffer & Lipson, Consumer Actions Against Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practives: The Private Uses of Federal Trade 
Commission Jurisprudence, 48 Geo Wash L. Rev. 521 (1980) for a discussion of application of FTC act case law to state unfair 
and deceptive practices statutes."
1156,5, Motorola and MCEI attempt to argue that 
1157,," ""as to the contract and the lease sued on by Associates [in its action, and by Fairway] in this case, they were assigned by MCEI 
to Motorola and by Motorola Fairway] in this case, they were assigned by MCEI to Motorola and by Motorola to Associates long 
before the time when the alleged bad faith conduct took place. Accordingly, since MCEI and Motorola were no longer performing 
under the contract and lease, they had no duty of good faith with respect thereto."" Defendant's Reply Memo at 44-45. This argument is somewhat disingenuous. Associates in seeking to have its warranty damages limited to an offset argues with 
the knowledge and consent of Motorola and MCEI, that it was assignee of the rights and not delegatee of the duties under the 
sales contract and lease. Motorola and MCEI simply cannot have it both ways. Either the entire contract was assigned to 
associates or merely Motorola's and MCEI's rights under the contract were assigned. Since we indicate below that the 
assignment to Associates was one of rights alone, we find that Motorola and MCEI retained their duties and obligations of 
performance under the contracts."
1157,6," Although Associates makes reference to an ""offset,"" Fairway's defensive claim is not unrelated to Associates' affirmative claim 
and hence ""recoupment"" is the technically correct label for the type of pleading which Associates seeks to impose here. See 3 
Moore's Federal Practice P 13.02 n. 1 (1982)."
1157,7," The language of the lease differs slightly, though not substantively from the language in the sale contract. Lease language is

1171,1," .  In the multi-trade/multi-employer agreement, unions from 24 different trades and employers from 18 contractor's associations 
agreed to a monetary package on February 17, 1970.  The agreement provided for a $ 0.90 increase effective on the expiration 
date of the current agreement; a $ 0.15 increase effective on October 1, 1970; and a $ 0.95 increase effective on June 1, 1971-
for an overall $ 2.00 increase over two years.  Also, the unions and employers agreed that value of cost-bearing conditions, later 
agreed to, would be subtracted from the monetary package and that no strike or lockouts would occur over the conditions.  The 
agreement was not binding on most of the unions until ratified by their memberships. "
1172,2," .  The uncontroverted evidence showed that had the plaintiffs engaged in masonry construction out-of-state, in Toledo, Ohio, for 
example, plaintiffs would be required to pay the wage rates and fringe benefits which prevailed in the Toledo area. "
1174,3," .  We are aware that a conflict exists between the circuits regarding McLain.  The Ninth Circuit has held that Sherman Act 
jurisdiction exists when any business activity of a defendant affects interstate commerce. Western Waste Service v. Universal 
Waste Control, 616 F.2d 1094 (9th Cir. 1980). Under a more conservative view of the reach of the Sherman Act, the Tenth 
Circuit has taken the position that a defendant's illegal activities must affect interstate commerce for jurisdiction to be present.  In 
the instant case, because the evidence supports a finding that defendants' alleged illegal actions affected interstate commerce, 
we need not decide whether Sherman Act jurisdiction could be founded solely on proof that defendants' general business activity 
affects interstate commerce."
1174,4," .  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) declares that statements of co-conspirators in the course of and furtherance of a conspiracy are not 
hearsay: (d) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if- (2) Admission by party-opponent.  The statement is offered against a party and is … (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a 
party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. "
1175,5," .  Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) provides: Questions of admissibility generally.  Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the 
existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision 
(b).  In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges."
1175,6," .  Fed.R.Evid. 104(b) provides: Relevancy conditioned on fact.  When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court 
shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition."
1175,7, .  Fed.R.Evid. 1101(b) provides: 
1176,," (b) Proceedings generally.  These rules apply generally to civil actions and proceedings including admiralty and maritime cases, 
to criminal cases and proceedings, to contempt proceedings except those in which the court may act summarily, and to 
proceedings and cases under the Bankruptcy Act. It could be argued that the burden of proof for admissibility in a civil case should be less than that in a criminal case, because the 
civil defendant is not exposed to the risk of loss of liberty and, hence, has a lesser need for protection from incompetent 
evidence.  This argument, however, misunderstands the basis for the Enright decision.  In Enright, we were first guided by an 
interpretation of Rules 104(a) and 104(b) in reaching the conclusion that the Rules had eliminated the prima facie standard for 
preliminary questions of competency.  We only then determined that use of the preponderance standard in making these 
evidentiary decisions would satisfy constitutional concerns which might arise in criminal cases.  U. S. v. Enright, supra, 579 F.2d 
at 984-85. Enright thus illustrates that the issue is primarily one of interpreting the Federal Rules of Evidence, rather than 
considering the burdens of proof required for the substantive issues in the case."
1176,8," .  By applying Enright to civil litigation, we do not diminish the value of the coconspirator's statements in proving the existence of 
a conspiracy since, as Vinson makes clear, the coconspirator's statements may be considered by the trial judge in making the 
evidentiary determination.  Moreover, if admitted, those statements may make the other evidence on the existence of a 
conspiracy more credible to the jury."
1176,9," .  In multi-employer/multi-union bargaining, the employers agree to bargain as a group, as do the unions.  The duty to bargain in 
this type of arrangement has been enforced by the National Labor Relations Board under section 8(b)(3) of the National Labor 
Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(3).  See, e.g., Local 260, Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers International Union, 228 NLRB No. 
179 (1977). "
1177,10," .  The ""statutory"" exemption was created by Congress in sections 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 17 and 29 U.S.C. § 
52, and in the Norris-La Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.  This exemption can only be asserted by a labor organization 
itself and will be lost if the union combines or conspires with a non-union group to restrain trade.  See, e.g., Allen Bradley Co. v. 
Local No. 3, IBEW, 325 U.S. 797, 65 S. Ct. 1533, 89 L. Ed. 1939 (1945). The ""non-statutory"" exemption was created by the 
Supreme Court to exempt agreements between unions and employers.  These agreements are not exempt under the statutory 
exemption because the unions are not acting unilaterally, but the Court has concluded that they should be exempt nevertheless 
as ""a proper accommodation between congressional policy favoring collective bargaining under the NLRA and the congressional 
policy favoring free competition in business markets."" Connell v. Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 95 S. 
Ct. 1830, 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). Because defendants in the present case are not labor organizations, they could not 
assert the statutory exemption. Employers, however, as well as labor unions, have successfully raised the nonstatutory 
exemption for provisions arising from collective bargaining. See McCourt v. California Sports, Inc., 600 F.2d 1193 (6th Cir. 
1979); Mackey v. National Football League, 543 F.2d 606, 612 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. dism'd., 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 28, 54 L.

evidence, the trial judge followed this court's decision in United States v. Vinson, 606 F.2d 149 (6th Cir. 1979), and properly 
considered all the evidence, including the hearsay statements.  Although plaintiffs have challenged the standard of proof applied

judge's factual determination was clearly erroneous. "

bargaining? (Mr. Dailey) A: I'm sorry, was it our belief that the other unions would follow the pattern set? Q: The unions not included here would follow the pattern that was established during the course of that bargain? A: We had no idea whether the other unions would follow the other pattern but I think everybody at the table realized since all 
construction bargaining is pattern bargaining that there would be a great precedent set by this settlement that in effect would 
form a pattern for subsequent bargaining and it was the hope of everybody there that the trades and the employer associations 
not represented in that multi-trade session would consider it as a pattern and not exceed it by any great amount of money, 
because if they had we wouldn't have been able to get our settlement ratified. Trial Transcript at 777-78. Also, Mr. Veighey, a defendant negotiator for CEC, testified in a deposition that was read into the record at trial: (plaintiffs' attorney) ""Q: Do you recall any members of the employer group, employer representatives raising a similar type of question as to the 
impact on multi-trade bargaining if any of the unions settled with other employers who were not represented in different terms? (Mr. Veighey) ""A: No, I don't recall any employer representative making any comment to that extent at all.  The general feeling in the meeting 
from the outset was one of pretty good faith.  I sat in on a lot of negotiations and I never experienced the attitude that seemed to 
be prevalent at this meeting, rather a certain amount of sincerity both on the management side and the union side all through the 
meeting.  Even though we were in disagreement on subjects but the employers did not make any kind of comment. ""Q: My question is: How did good faith relate to your not bringing this matter up to the union? ""A: I suppose because we kind of trusted them.  They would try to do their thing and we definitely were going to try to do ours. ""Q: You trusted them to do it? ""A: To do whatever they were going to do in negotiations. Apparently a plateau had been established in every year of 
negotiations that we ever met.  We always had some number out there somewhere by somebody to look at, some carry over 
contract or something.  One of the union fellows, I don't know who it was, but one of them, anyhow, came from this side of the 
table and made the comment that it would establish a plateau and that was not out of line, so far as I am concerned, because in 
other years we had faced other plateaus, common language in our industry. ""Q: You say this would establish a plateau.  Would this plateau mean in labor terminology basis for settlement with other 
employers? "
1182,," ""A: At least it was something to aim at.  They could go higher than that if they wanted to.  They could do whatever they wanted to 
in their negotiations. I guess we were trusting each other, we would try to encourage more people to come into future multi-trade 
bargaining. That is why good faith does have some reference to the whole thing. ""Q: Do you mean you were trusting them not to settle with other employer groups on better and different terms? ""A: Just trusting them not to upset the apple cart in whatever area they would do it."" Trial Transcript at 1024-27."
1182,17," .  The telegram was sent by Mr. Dailey to Jack Wood, secretary and business manager of the Detroit Building Trades Council 
(an association of construction unions), on May 25, 1970 shortly after the DMAC settled with the union for $ 3.00 over 3 years.  It 
stated: ""We request a special meeting of the negotiating committee, parties to the multi-trade agreement.  We suggest that the 
committee meet at the Detroit Building Trades Office on Wednesday, May 27th at 2:00 P.M.  Subject is the recent … settlement 
of a contract between Detroit … Mason Contractors Association and Laborer's Local 334 Local 1076.  Please advise."" Signed Thomas E. Dailey, President, Construction Employers Council. Trial Transcript at 849."
1182,18," .  Labor law commentators have also indicated that in the reality of collective bargaining employers always have a concern 
about the wages their competitors pay.  Professor St. Antoine writes: ""it is simply unrealistic to insist that an employer has no 
valid interest in the union wage scale to be paid by the employer's competitors."" St. Antoine, supra, note 12, 62 U.Va.L.Rev. at 
610. In the same vein, Professor Leslie commented: ""it is virtually inevitable that the bargaining process will include at least 
some discussion of whether the union intends to demand a uniform wage rate from all employers."" Leslie, supra, note 12, 66 
U.Va.L.Rev. at 1209 n.89. In the instant case, the evidence indicated that the defendants were concerned about setting a 
pattern, but there was no evidence that they presented this to the union. "
1183,19," .  In a deposition that was read into the record Mr. Veighey stated: (plaintiffs' attorney) ""Q: You mean you were discussing among yourselves what might happen if employer groups who were not present might settle 
for different periods of time at different amounts? ""A: No. ""Q: What do you mean by evaluation?  What were you trying to evaluate with regards to groups that were not there? ""A: Frankly, we did not want to hurt anybody.  We did not want to set up some sort of a situation that would hurt somebody. ""Q: What do you mean?  How could the situation you were setting up hurt someone else? ""A: Well, as history indicates, there were employers that did not agree with our settlement. ""Q: At that time until the caucus in terms of what you were discussing, how could what you did hurt someone else? "
1184,," ""A: We came to the conclusion that it would not.  We came to the conclusion because we were establishing a new concept of 
bargaining and everything that that contract had in it, arbitration, everything else and to pay the price that we had to pay to get 
that contract, plus faced with a carry over contract for a greater amount, we did not think we could do any better on our own or 
we did not think that others could, at least it was our opinion that others could not do any better on their own. ""Q: Is it fair, then, to say you came to the conclusion that that particular agreement would be good for the other employer groups 
as well as your own? ""A: It was our sincere hope that our decision would do that, right."" Trial Transcript at 1034-35. "
1192,1," Formerly called Ambulance Service of Clay County, Inc."
1192,2," HN1[
] Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., these motions are being treated as motions for summary judgment rather than as motions to dismiss since matters outside the pleadings have been presented to the Court.  In ruling on these motions the 
Court has considered the pleadings, briefs and exhibits filed in this case, along with the transcript of a preliminary injunction 
hearing held before Judge Scott O. Wright on March 13, 16 and 17, 1981.  The Court has also considered the provisions of the 
applicable state laws and Kansas City ordinances. "
1193,3," These and other issues concerning ambulance service were developed in detail in the March, 1981, hearing on MAST's 
request for a preliminary injunction against Gold Cross and Transfer.  These issues are discussed in Judge Scott O. Wright's 
April 7, 1981, order denying the preliminary injunction."
1193,4," For the first two years that the ordinance was in effect, ASI continued to own its ambulance equipment. In September, 1981, 
this ambulance equipment was sold to MAST, as contemplated by the public utility model. When Kansas City's current 
ambulance service contract with ASI expires, a new contract will be given to the company which successfully bids for it, and this 
company will simply provide the personnel and services necessary to operate the MAST-owned equipment. "
1197,5," Amended December, 1981. "
1199,6," In addition to challenging the validity of the Kansas City ordinance, plaintiffs also claim that defendant MAST has violated the 
antitrust laws by attempting to induce other municipalities to enact a public utility model for ambulance service. This claim does 
not merit lengthy discussion. Any such actions which MAST may have taken are clearly exempt from the antitrust laws under the 
Noerr doctrine, discussed infra at page 19. "
1200,7," Recently the Fifth Circuit, in Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. Abbott Laboratories, 656 F.2d 92 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. 
granted, 50 U.S.L.W. 3715 (U.S. March 8, 1982) (No. 81-827), and the Sixth Circuit in Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 
Ohio, 654 F.2d 1187 (1981), cert. granted, vacated and remanded, 50 U.S.L.W. 3667 (U.S. Feb. 22, 1982) (No. 81-723), held 
that antitrust regulations could violate the Tenth Amendment when applied to state and local governments.  Both Jefferson City 
Pharmaceutical and Hybud were decided within a few weeks of Hodel. Hybud did not cite Hodel, while Jefferson County 
Pharmaceutical cited it only in a footnote to the dissenting opinion. Both cases read Usery very broadly, without the qualifying 
language of Hodel, and Hybud, which involved state action exemption issues, has been vacated and remanded for 
reconsideration in light of Community Communications.  These two cases therefore have limited value as precedent.  However, 
they are significant because of their recognition that antitrust laws, like other federal regulations, can infringe on the sovereignty 
of state and local governments."
1200,8," As the Supreme Court noted in Usery at footnote 20, HN17[
] the Tenth Amendment protects city and local governments as well as the states themselves.  49 L. Ed. 2d at 260."
1200,9," The issue of what constitutes a state governmental function was discussed in the very recent case of United Transportation 
Union v. Long Island Railroad Co., 455 U. S. 678, 102 S. Ct. 1349, 71 L. Ed 2d 547(1982). In this case the Supreme Court found 
that ""operation of a passenger railroad is not among those [state] governmental functions generally immune from federal 
regulation"" under the Tenth Amendment. Slip Op. at 7.  The case at bar is distinguishable from United Transportation Union.  
United Transportation Union dealt with railroads, which have been the subject of extensive federal regulation for nearly a 
century. There is no comparable history of federal regulation of ambulance service, which has traditionally been an area of state 
and local concern."
1200,10," Even if the City's actions were not permitted by the state action exemption and the Tenth Amendment, it is not clear that 
plaintiffs could recover the relief they seek.  Plaintiffs ask for both injunctive and monetary relief.  Neither Lafayette nor 
Community Communications, the two cases dealing with antitrust actions against cities, reached the issue of whether damages 
could be recovered from a municipality for its violation of the antitrust laws. In this case plaintiffs are engaged in the ambulance business for private gain. The City, on the other hand, is seeking to protect 
its citizens' health and safety.  The City not only makes no profit from its ambulance service system, it in fact expends tax money 
to subsidize the system.  Under the circumstances, we do not believe the City should be held liable in damages to plaintiffs. "
1201,11," As we noted above, defendants Hughes, Reimal and the DeSaulniers sold all the stock of ASI to MAST in September, 1981.  
There is, however, no dispute that defendants created ASI and owned it until the time of the sale to MAST. "
1203,12," The Court ultimately found that plaintiffs did have some due process property interest in the cable television contract itself.  
The Court's holding was very limited, however.  The Court essentially held that, once the city had decided to go through with the 
bidding procedure, it was required to act non-arbitrarily in deciding which bidder should be awarded the contract.  Even the very 
limited due process right recognized by the court in Three Rivers is not universally accepted.  See, e.g., Estey Corporation v. 
Matzke, 431 F. Supp. 468 (N.D. Ill. 1976), in which the court stated categorically that a bidder on a government contract had no 
property interest at all in the contract ""until such time as the contract is actually awarded to him."" Id. at 470. In any case, Three 
Rivers is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar since, in this case, the bidding procedure was simply not used at all.  (For a 
more complete discussion of the Three Rivers case, see Kendrick v. City Council of Augusta, Georgia, 516 F. Supp. 1134 (S.D. 
Ga. 1981).) "
1204,13," Apparently at one point in 1981 ASI was operating without a city license because the license had been allowed to lapse. 
Plaintiffs could thus contend that during the period ASI was without a license it was ""similarly situated"" with Gold Cross and 
Transfer. However, this would satisfy only the first of the two elements needed for a valid discriminatory enforcement claim. "
1206,1," .  At the time, Furr was a law professor and his fee reflected the lack of overhead and the investigative nature of his assignment. 
Furr has made no claim against defendants for hours spent during this stage. "
1207,2," .  The nature of the ""agreement"" between VACP and counsel is set out in an affidavit of Robert J. Resnick who is a plaintiff in 
this case and who was president of VACP during negotiations with Furr and Bloomfield concerning their representation of VACP. During the course of our discussions and negotiations, we agreed that Mr. Furr and Mr. Bloomfield would represent us in this 
litigation and that, as a term of that agreement, a ceiling of $ 10,000 would be imposed with respect to expenses during the first 
year of litigation, since Mr. Furr and Mr. Bloomfield both hoped that a quick injunctive suit or settlement would be litigated at 
modest expense. This $ 10,000 ceiling was a budget-planning figure for VACP to rely upon in raising funds to make certain that we could meet our 
obligations as plaintiffs for the payment of costs and expenses, since we knew that we would be legally obligated to pay those 
expenses, even if Mr. Furr and Mr. Bloomfield advanced them and were later unsuccessful in the litigation. It was our understanding that we would not pay any fees to Mr. Furr or Mr. Bloomfield out of the $ 10,000 initially budgeted 
unless they concluded the case so quickly that $ 10,000 in costs and expenses had not yet been incurred.  In that event, the 
remainder of the $ 10,000 (after costs were deducted) would be available to contribute to payment of their fees. It was always our understanding that as plaintiffs we would be entitled to an additional statutory award of attorney's fees under 
the antitrust laws and that these monies would be paid to Messrs. Furr and Bloomfield as their compensation in this case."
1207,3," .  In August 1980, the Supreme Court of Virginia upheld the constitutionality of a Virginia statute requiring the Blue Shield plans 
to reimburse clinical psychologists directly.  Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 349, 269 S.E.2d "
1208,827," (1980). This in turn was the basis for a 15 Sept. 1980 order of the Virginia State Corporation Commission which effectively 
barred defendants from refusing to make direct payments."
1208,4," .  The Court's reasoning as to this issue is set forth in Part VII, infra."
1208,5," .  The Barber criteria are: (1) the time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised; (3) the skill 
required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4) the attorney's opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) 
the customary fee for like work; (6) the attorney's expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7) the time limitations imposed by 
the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of 
the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in which the suit arose; (11) the nature and length of 
the professional relationship between attorney and client; and (12) attorney's fees awards in similar cases.  577 F.2d at 226 n. 
28. "
1209,6," .  In Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., supra, cited with approval in Anderson, the Fifth Circuit suggested that factors 8 
and 9 also merited special attention.  Id. at 583."
1209,7," .  See Stanford Daily v. Zurcher, 64 F.R.D. 680 (N.D.Cal.1974); Davis v. County of Los Angeles, 8 E.P.D. P 94444 
(C.D.Cal.1974); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 66 F.R.D. 483 (W.D.N.C.1975). "
1210,8," .  Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the fee petition reflects only Mr. Bloomfield's time between March and June 
1978.  Mr. Furr agreed that he would not submit an application for any time spent prior to June 1978.  Such time would have 
included the time spent by Mr. Furr while conducting a feasibility study of the instant antitrust action.  Plaintiffs emphasize that 
they have been conservative in their application and have voluntarily subtracted a number of hours and other charges.  Plaintiffs 
are, of course, free to subtract whatever they wish.  Such subtractions, however, have no bearing on the deductions which this 
Court may determine to be necessary.  The Court notes that a considerable number of hours have probably been expended 
since September 1981 which are not reflected in the fee petition.  Nothing in this award shall be construed to limit plaintiffs in 
seeking such further relief regarding attorney fees to which they are otherwise entitled. "
1211,9," .  This sum reflects minor adjustments by the Court to the hours claimed by plaintiffs in correcting discrepancies between hours 
recorded on daily timesheets and the various compilations provided by plaintiffs. "
1212,10," .  The Court notes that there is an occasional random entry for such administrative duties as billing letters, but there is no 
evidence that the attorneys in this case spent any significant time on work that might be considered administrative."
1212,11," .  The Court also notes that approximately 54 hours of law clerk and paralegal time lacks description.  Here too, however, the 
Court has plaintiff counsel's affidavit that the work was devoted to this matter."
1212,12," .  As a practical matter, only 17.5 of the 35 undocumented hours in 1978 are reflected in the fee petition, the other 50% having 
been deducted by plaintiffs as McCready time."
1212,13," .  Furr alleges in an affidavit that Mr. Bloomfield and he made a conscious decision early on to split the work in this matter.  This 
policy according to Furr was practiced during depositions, discovery, at trial and in written work, in the latter instance ""by 
allocating the written work between our respective firms rather than by engaging in it simultaneously."" The Court rejects 
defendants' assertions that counsel time was unnecessarily increased because conferences were between members of two 
firms rather than one firm. "
1213,14," .  Plaintiffs assert that 60% of their pleadings, excluding deposition notices, were responsive to materials filed by defendants.  
The docket entries bear this out. "
1214,15," .  Defendants suggest in their brief that notwithstanding their contention that 90% of plaintiffs' hours were spent on NSV, they 
would accept a reduction of 50% of plaintiffs' hours on this point. "
1215,16," .  The Court also recognizes that the burden on a plaintiff in a Section 16 case is considerably less than in a Section 4 case.  A 
Section 4 plaintiff must establish a defendant's liability for a proven injury to be entitled to attorney fees.  Absent a judgment on 
the merits there will be no such award. Under Section 16, a plaintiff need only substantially prevail to earn his entitlement to fees.  That may include situations where 
plaintiff has obtained relief from a defendant without benefit of a final judgment over a defendant.  See e.g., Grumman Corp. v. 
LTV, 533 F. Supp. 1385 (E.D.N.Y.1982). However, even under Section 16 a plaintiff must be required to come out ahead before 
he can assert a claim for attorneys fees. Congress' purpose in awarding attorneys' fees in antitrust and other kinds of suits is to encourage prospective plaintiffs to pursue 
such litigation.  The Court cannot know whether the method selected by Congress will so encourage plaintiffs or so discourage 
defendants that the spirited litigation in the adversary tradition as evidenced in this case will give way to something less 
desirable as the sheer weight of financial expense causes defendants to cave in unnecessarily or spurs plaintiffs to litigation at 
the first faint blush of a possible violation. Though a matter about which the Court is concerned, the method of encouragement is a question of policy, not law.  Policy 
decisions are the province of Congress and it is incumbent upon judges to follow their rules.  If the rule works well the nation 
benefits, if the rule works ill then Congress can change it.  That is not the task of this Court. "

529 F. Supp. 272, 278 (D.Col.1981) (compensating under § 4, of all issues ""that a reasonable and prudent antitrust lawyer would 
have litigated""). The reasons underlying the denial of compensation pursuant to Section 4 for the pursuit of unproductive theories 
in antitrust actions, may be attributable to the particular policies that have developed regarding treble-damage actions.  See 
Seigal v. Merrick, 619 F.2d 160, 165 n. 10 (2d Cir. 1980); Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 1263, 1269 n. 6 
(N.D.Cal.1879). "
1220,18," .  Notwithstanding the unsettled state of the law on this point, courts in using the above guidelines have not hesitated to award 
rates higher than the ""local rate"" in appropriate circumstances. See e.g., Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., supra; International Travel 
Arrangers, Inc. v. Western Airlines, Inc., supra, at 1275; Sherrill v. J. P. Stevens & Co., Inc., 441 F. Supp. 846, 848-49 
(W.D.N.C.1977), aff'd, 594 F.2d 858 (4th Cir. 1979)."
1220,19, .  Perhaps this troublesome problem is receding.
1220,20," .  The Court has before it defendants' fully briefed motion to strike certain of plaintiffs' affidavits, primarily those relating to the 
fees paid to lawyers in District of Columbia law firms. Defendants rely upon the Court's bench ruling of 12 November 1981 
striking the affidavit of E. Waller Dudley.  The Dudley affidavit purported to compare certain unnamed, but specific, lawyers in his "
1221,," firm with specific lawyers representing plaintiffs in this action. The Court has no doubt as to Mr. Dudley's good faith or as to his 
probity in making the comparisons, and assumes counsel for plaintiff have similar regard for Mr. Dudley.  Nevertheless, as 
advocates in this case, plaintiffs' counsel had every right to probe the accuracy of his opinion as to comparability.  Indeed, they 
had a duty to do so.  Their inability to exercise that right rendered the Dudley affidavit inadmissible. The relevant affidavits to this motion are not of the Dudley genre.  They contain no opinion or comparison.  They simply state 
facts within the personal knowledge of the affiants.  As to these facts, defendants had every opportunity under Fed.R.Civ.P. 31 
to probe.  There is no unfairness involved in ruling out the Dudley affidavit and ruling in the plaintiffs' affidavits.  This is no ""sauce 
for the goose"" situation.  While the motion to strike the affidavits is denied, the weight to be given the affidavits is something else 
again. "
1222,21," .  In its 23 November 1981 compilation of hours, Lewis, Mitchell & Moore attribute 91.4 hours of 1981 time to junior partners.  
91.2 hours of this time has been attributed to Brownell who had previously been characterized as an associate."
1222,22," .  Parties are always at liberty to hire additional counsel so long as they are willing to pay the fee.  Plaintiffs' counsel were 
obviously up to the task of meeting defendants' superstars and, as such, would not necessarily have been entitled to any extra "
1223,," fee had they instead decided to hire their own stable of thoroughbreds.  See Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., supra; International

findings of fact with regard to the (twelve) factors considered,"" Barber v. Kimbrell's Inc., supra, at 226, by a district court's making 
a fee award. Moreover, a district court is bound to comply with such a mandate.  The procedure mandated by Barber, however, 
in attempting to fill all the interstices, so fragments the analysis that a coherent picture of the case is all but unobtainable.  
Anderson alleviates partially the fragmentation problem and hence is more realistic.  Nevertheless, the court's and counsels' 
attention is still diverted by the need to frame their respective analysis on a Procrustean bed of 12-factors that prevents a 
balancing of conflicting factors or a melding of complimentary factors so essential to a determination of an overall conclusion. As 
a consequence, the proofs and briefs of counsel, and a properly considered opinion of the court, are unnecessarily prolix and 
redundant.  The case is forced to fit the mandated analysis rather than the analysis conforming to the case."

fees and costs. "
1232,1," The term ""Realtor"" is a registered mark of the National Association of Realtors, used to refer only to members of the Realtor 
trade association.  The National Association licenses state and local Boards to use this mark."
1232,2," Although plaintiff stopped paying his MCMLS dues as well, defendants concede that failure to pay MCBR dues would alone 
have precluded his participation in MCMLS.  By the terms of a consent order signed June 24, 1977, plaintiff has been permitted 
to pay his MCBR dues in escrow and to participate in MCMLS until conclusion of the case. "
1233,3," Defendants invite our attention to several federal district court decisions that seem to be apposite: Brown v. Indianapolis Board 
of Realtors, 1977-1Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) para. 61,435 (S.D.Ind.1977) (no antitrust violation where broker denied membership 
to Board of Realtors, based on failure to show ""favorable business reputation in the community""); Martin-Trigona v. National 
Association of Realtors, 1978-1Trade Reg. Rep. para. 61,915 (E.D.Ill.1978) (memorandum opinion relying on Brown, supra, for 
proposition that Realtor Board, as a voluntary trade association, may properly exclude any nonmember from participation in its 
varied activities); Murphy v. Alpha Realty, Inc., 1978-2Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) para. 62,388 (N.D.Ill.1978) (relying on Brown, 
supra, for proposition that Board membership is acceptable limitation on multiple listing service participation); Colorado ex rel. "
1234,," MacFarlane v. Colorado Springs Board of Realtors, 1980-81Trade Reg.Rep. para. 63,653 (Dist.Ct.Col.1980), (only membership 
requirements necessary to efficient operation of multiple listing service permissible, where Realtor Board and multiple listing 
service considered single identity).  Because these trial court opinions treat the multiple-listing-access-question in a cursory 
manner, they lack persuasive force and amount to no more than a respected source of instruction.  Cf.  Clairol Inc. v. Cosmetics 
Plus, 130 N.J. Super. 81, 94-101 (Ch.Div.1974) (containing painstaking analysis of pertinent authorities)."
1234,4," Every broker-member of MCBR is required to pay annual dues of $ 170 ($ 125 when plaintiff quit the Board), plus a $ 40 fee for 
each salesperson in his employ.  Each Realtor who elects to participate additionally in MCMLS is required to pay an initiation fee 
of $ 250, in addition to monthly fees of $ 25 and $ 15 for employed brokers and salespeople respectively. "
1235,5," For instance, the Monmouth County tax records proved to be a doubtful source of relevant information because of the failure of 
those records to indicate whether a given transfer was effected through the services of a real estate broker. Consequently, 
although the parties could determine the dollar value of residential sales in the MCBR-chartered jurisdictional territory in 1977, 
they could only guess at the proportion of those sales that involved real estate brokers."
1235,6," The Yellow Pages survey sought to compare the total number of active real estate brokers in the MCBR-chartered jurisdictional 
territory with the number of brokers actually participating in the MCMLS.  In order to arrive at the latter figure the Antitrust 
Section compared Red Bank-area Yellow Pages advertisers specifying that they were MCMLS participators with the MCBR 
membership roster.  When a name appeared on both ""lists"", the broker was assumed to have been a member of the MCMLS, as 
opposed to another multiple listing service.  Those Yellow Pages advertisers who concentrated on property sales other than 
residential real estate were excluded from the survey (the Antitrust Section offered no explanation, however, as to why 
condominium sellers were excluded).  Because there are three Monmouth County telephone books (Red Bank, Asbury Park and 
Freehold), advertisers may choose to advertise in any one or more of the Yellow Pages books.  It follows, then, that in limiting 
the survey to the Red Bank Yellow Pages, the Antitrust Section may have artificially reduced its final tally of Monmouth County 
real estate brokers. Moreover, the entire survey rests upon the dubious assumption that all real estate brokers located in the 
MCBR-chartered jurisdictional territory advertise in the Red Bank Yellow Pages. "
1236,7," Although the trial court relied heavily on the testimony of Harry J. Gerlach, executive officer of the Multiple Listing Service of 
Northern New Jersey, to establish that multiple listing services do operate without Realtor Board sponsorship, it appeared to 
ignore the fact that the initiation fee for the Northern New Jersey Multiple Listing Service is $ 1300 as compared to the $ 250 fee 
maintained for the MCMLS.  The annual cost of MCBR membership with MCMLS participation for a broker and one salesperson 
is $ 690.  The annual cost of Northern New Jersey Multiple Listing Service membership for a broker with a single salesperson is 
$ 308 plus $ 25 for each listing submitted.  To a firm that handles fifteen listings, then, the cost of the two memberships is 
roughly equal.  An apples-oranges comparison does not, of course, demonstrate that Board-affiliated multiple listing service 
participation is cheaper.  It does suggest that in focusing on whether MCBR benefits could be reproduced outside the 
organization, the trial court appeared to brush aside the possibility that the cost of such benefits might then be substantially 
higher.  The court appears not to have considered the procompetitive benefits (as opposed to the benefit to MCBR or to 
MCMLS) that arises from Board sponsorship of MCMLS. "
1238,8," In People v. National Association of Realtors, 120 Cal.App.3d 459, 174 Cal.Rptr. 728 (Ct.App.Cal.1981), a California Court of 
Appeals specifically declined to follow the Cedar Rapids court's interpretation of Marin County.  Id. 174 Cal.Rptr. at 732. The 
court struck down as an illegal group boycott a realtor board rule that conditioned multiple listing service access on board 
membership. It described the Marin County decision as having ""analyzed each restriction separately, found each to have 
anticompetitive effects far outweighing any possible business justification (the Rule of Reason test) and separately disapproved 
the MLS limitation for access to Board members only."" Id. We view that conclusion as erroneous and agree with the Cedar 
Rapids interpretation that it was the combination of two Board by-laws that amounted to the antitrust violation. The following 
language from Marin County is particularly significant: We emphasize that the question before us concerns the validity of the ""primarily engaged"" rule in conjunction with other 
board bylaws effectively denying employment to nonmember salesmen.  [16 Cal.3d at 938 n.13, 549 P.2d at 844 n.13, 130 
Cal.Rptr. at 12 n.13 (emphasis added).] "
1246,*," The Honorable Robert J. Kelleher, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation."
1246,1," Throughout this opinion, ""Sportservice"" refers to both Twin City Sportservice, Inc., and its parent corporation, Sportservice 
Corporation. "
1247,2," By order of October 14, 1981, the noncorporate appellees and cross-appellants were added to this litigation.  Throughout this 
opinion, ""Finley"" shall refer to all appellees and cross-appellants."
1247,3," The parties and prior courts agree that the relevant geographic market in this case is national.  While we confine our 
terminology to ""relevant market,"" in other contexts, it would more appropriately be referred to as the relevant product market to 
distinguish the analysis from geographic market. "
1248,4," The district court eliminated a number of facilities and activities that had been suggested by this court on prior appeal to be in 
the possible zone of production substitutes.  See, 512 F.2d at 1274. The district court concluded that boxing, soccer, rodeos, 
circuses, music festivals, and track and field events take place in facilities already considered to be within the zone of production 
substitutes and that these facilities ""generally do not offer a separate and additional franchise for their concession operations."" 
March 31, 1977 Memorandum and Order at 10.  The court also noted that fairs do not usually offer the type of concession 
franchise at issue in this litigation, and that ""horse racing, dog racing, and convention centers all must be excluded because the 
use of a kitchen for providing full dinners is an important part of their operation."" Id."
1248,5," This market control figure of 24% compares with a finding of 50% control of the major league baseball concession market after 
the first trial.  See, 365 F. Supp. at 250. The 24% figure represents the result of a ""weighted"" calculation of Sportservice 
contracts by doubling the number of those held by Sportservice at major league baseball facilities.  This weighting was 
performed pursuant to evidence submitted that major league baseball concession franchise revenues average twice that of other 
major league sports concessions. "
1249,6," The record indicates that the satellite concessions and college football concessions do not produce sufficient income in order 
to meet the Pantuso threshold tests; thus, our affirmance of the district court's findings of the relevant market, using the 
threshold tests, supports the district court's exclusion of satellite and college football concessions. "
1250,7," In addition to the Pantuso testimony, the record indicates that Mr. Richard P. Komen, who represented himself as manager of 
Volume Service Company in 1971 when he testified before Justice Clark, affirmed that he also used a $ 250,000 gross sales 
threshold figure to determine whether his company would be interested in obtaining a concession franchise. "
1253,8," In addition to Tampa Electric, supra, and Fortner, the district court cited a number of cases wherein aggregate market activity 
was looked at in assessing antitrust violations.  These include: Cornwell Quality Tools Co. v. C.T.S. Co., 446 F.2d 825 (9th Cir. 
1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S. Ct. 715, 716, 30 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1972) (action by tool distributor against tool 
manufacturer for alleged violations of section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act and others); Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 
F.2d 459 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993, 84 S. Ct. 1920, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1964) (action by lessee and dealer of 
petroleum products against oil company for alleged violations of Sherman and Clayton Acts from oil company's dealings with its 
dealers).  Even though the issue may not have been raised in these other cases, we find that the above cases support the 
district court's conclusion that aggregation of market contracts and activity in assessing various antitrust violations is understood.  
Sportservice's attempts to distinguish the cases focus on insignificant distinctions between the above cases and the instant case 
which we reject without elaboration."
1253,9," Tampa Electric, supra, involved a challenge to a requirements contractual arrangement under both section 3 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14, and sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2.  The Court limited its discussion to the 
application of section 3 of the Clayton Act and concluded that: ""even though a contract is found to be an exclusive-dealing arrangement, it does not violate the section unless the court believes 
it probable that performance of the contract will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected."" Tampa Electric, supra, 365 U.S. at 327, 81 S. Ct. at 628, 5 L. Ed. 2d at 586-87. "
1254,," The Court did not reach the plaintiff's Sherman Act section 1 claim, noting that it was unnecessary to do so since the exclusive-
dealing arrangement in Tampa Electric did not violate the broader proscriptions of section 3 of the Clayton Act. The Court in 
Tampa Electric held that before a Clayton Act section 3 violation can be found, lower courts must determine whether exclusive-
dealing arrangements have the requisite anticompetitive effect upon a substantial share of the relevant market. The anti-
competitive impact, vel non, of conduct challenged under section 1 of the Sherman Act is also the focus of the rule of reason 
analysis.  National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 691, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L. Ed. 2d 
637, 650 (1978). We therefore read Tampa Electric to support the conclusion that HN7[
] exclusive-dealing arrangements challenged under section 1 of the Sherman Act cannot be considered as per se violations.  In so concluding, we reiterate what 
was said in Finley I that a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required to establish a Sherman Act violation than a 
section 3 Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases.  See Finley I, supra, 512 F.2d at 1275. "
1255,10," Sportservice cites Shell Oil v. Marinello, 120 N.J.Super. 357, 294 A.2d 253 (1972), aff'd, 63 N.J. 402, 307 A.2d 598 (1973), 
cert. denied, 415 U.S. 920, 94 S. Ct. 1421, 39 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1974) (action involving interpretation of a lease and a dealer 
agreement entered into between major oil company and one of its service station operators, and a determination of the extent of 
the oil company's right to terminate the lease and agreement with only ten days' notice), and Atlantic Richfield v. Razumic, 480 
Pa. 366, 390 A.2d 736 (1978) (action by service station operator against oil company seeking to void contract provision 
providing for termination at will); and Arnott v. American Oil Co., 609 F.2d 873 (8th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 918, 100 S. 
Ct. 1852, 64 L. Ed. 2d 272 (1980) (action by service station dealer against oil company alleging, inter alia, that oil company 
breached its fiduciary duty owed to dealer by terminating lease without good cause).  The public policy thrust of each of these 
decisions is stated aptly in Marinello : ""Viewing the combined lease and franchise …, it becomes apparent that Shell is the dominant party and that the relationship 
lacks equality in the respective bargaining positions of the parties."""
1255,307," A.2d at 601. Sportservice transforms the holdings of these contract cases into an argument that would support the length of 
its concession franchise agreements.  These cases are not only inapposite in subject matter and policy considerations, they are 
also totally irrelevant to the consideration of the anticompetitive effects of lengthy contracts under the circumstances of this case."
1255,11," At one point in its brief, Sportservice contends that it does ""nothing more or less than acquire a franchise to sell fast food 
items at a particular location"" not unlike ""McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Burger King, Dairy Queen 
and others."" As discussed in the body of this opinion, this purported analogy exists, if at all, only superficially. "
1256,12," The district court below noted that the exclusivity, per se, of the concession franchise agreements was not at issue and that 
the parties agreed that the exclusive arrangement is the only practical way to conduct the business of concession sales at the 
events and facilities involved.  We will adhere to this stipulation of sorts and only add that we make no judgment as to the 
propriety of the exclusive nature of the franchise agreements.  We do sense a certain irony about this, however.  While our 
decision here may promote competition in the concession franchise market, the unchallenged pragmatic monopolies created by 
these exclusive agreements will probably prevent this decision from having much effect upon the price of the spectator's next hot 
dog."
1256,13," Sportservice takes issue with six findings of fact that were made by Judge Peckham in his application of the rule of reason as 
suggested in Standard Stations, supra, 337 U.S. at 308, 69 S. Ct. at 1059, 93 L. Ed. at 1383, which involves an inquiry into the 
degree to which ""competition has flourished"" despite the anticompetitive restraints of the contracts at issue, ""the conformity of 
the length of their term to the reasonable requirements of the field of commerce in which they were used,"" ""the status of the 
defendant as a struggling newcomer or an established competitor,"" and, most importantly, the ""defendant's degree of market 
control…."" Id. Also, Judge Peckham's analysis was performed with the use of the evidence entered before Justice Clark, together with 
evidence from the post-remand proceedings.  Judge Peckham discussed his stance regarding the viability of the fact findings 
made during the first trial by Justice Clark: ""The parties are in dispute as to what findings of Justice Clark remain viable and effective after the Ninth Circuit's reversal of his 
relevant market and consequent liability holdings.  We are of the opinion that specific findings of fact concerning the histories of 
this and other Sportservice baseball contracts, 365 F. Supp. at 245-49, and conclusions of law concerning the reasonableness "
1257,," of these contracts, 365 F. Supp. at 249-51, remain intact.  In any case, we do not base our holdings on his findings, for we have 
reviewed the record, and we are in complete agreement with his factual findings and his conclusion that these contract terms are 
unreasonably long."" Memorandum and Order of December 29, 1978, at 18, n.2. The dispute over the viability of the pre-remand factual findings made by Justice Clark has not been carried to this appeal.  
Thus, it is not necessary for us to determine whether the pre-remand findings automatically survive under the circumstances of 
this litigation.  Besides, Judge Peckham performed an independent review of the pre-remand record and noted his ""complete 
agreement."" Accordingly, for purposes of evaluating whether particular findings are clearly erroneous, the complete record-both 
pre- and post-remand-are available to us for evaluation.  Finally, many of Justice Clark's factual findings involve Sportservice's 
concession contracts with major league baseball teams that remain as a significant number of Sportservice's aggregate share of 
the expanded relevant market. The continued relevancy of such findings is therefore obvious."
1257,14," See section III.B.3.b. of this opinion, supra. "
1259,15," These damages represent ""the difference between what (Finley) would have received had there been no illegal restraints and 
what (Finley) actually received under the 1950 contract (with Sportservice)."" See, 365 F. Supp. at 255. The damages are for the 
four-year period from 1964 to 1967."
1259,16," Since we find for Finley on the interest issue, it is unnecessary to discuss Finley's arguments regarding the application of 
inflation factors. Finley also requests, in the alternative, that interest run at least from the date of the order establishing Sportservice's liability, 
December 29, 1978.  Our decision, requiring interest to be calculated from the date of the entry of the first judgment, covers this 
requested period without reaching the merits of Finley's arguments that 28 U.S.C. § 1961 requires application of interest to 
periods between pronouncement of liability and entry of judgment. "
1260,17," The transactions which gave rise to Mt. Hood's claims against Greyhound are discussed at Mt. Hood I, supra, and are not 
relevant to our inquiry here."
1260,18," The Commission proceedings had been initiated pursuant to section 5(9) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. § 5(9), 
and involved issues with the same transactions involved in the antitrust litigation: See Mt. Hood I, 555 F.2d at 689-90."
1260,19," In fairness to Judge Peckham, it is not clear from his March 31, 1980 Memorandum and Order whether he had the benefit of 
this court's most recent pronouncement in Mt. Hood III, supra, where this court discussed the interest issue in light of 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1961. See 616 F.2d 406-07. "
1261,," Our decision here would be no less compelled if Mt. Hood were read in the manner suggested by Judge Peckham because the 
equities attaching to Finley and Mt. Hood are similar.  Judge Peckham's limited interest award emphasized the fact that Finley 
was responsible for the delay in obtaining its second judgment from its actions in asserting what was determined to be an 
erroneous relevant market. Even if we could accept that responsibility for delay is a proper standard for district courts to use in 
granting or denying post-judgment interest (and we decline to do so here), appellant in Mt. Hood bore the same responsibility for 
asserting an erroneous position on appeal.  The appellant in Mt. Hood did raise the prevailing theory after trial and in the 
appellate courts, but also vigorously asserted on appeal what was determined by the Supreme Court to be an erroneous theory.  
We see no significant differences between this case and Mt. Hood that would counsel us not to follow its precedent of granting 
post-judgment interest to the prevailing party commencing on the date of the first judgment. "

1283,1," M&M's fuel cutoff is a floating bulb that falls with the boiler's water level. When the level reaches the critical point, the bulb 
causes a switch to cut off the boiler's fuel supply.  Hydrolevel's product, in contrast, was an immovable probe inserted in the side 
of the boiler; when the water level dropped below the probe, the fuel supply was interrupted.  Because water in a boiler surges 
and bubbles, the level intermittently would seem to fall slightly below the probe even though the overall level remained safe.  To 
prevent premature fuel cutoff because of these intermittent fluctuations, Hydrolevel's probe included a time delay that allowed 
the boiler to operate for a brief period after the water level dropped beneath the probe."
1283,2," Hardin was an executive vice president of Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company.  A controlling interest in 
Hartford was owned by International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, which acquired M&M within the year.  See 635 F.2d 
118, 122, n. 2 (CA2 1980). "
1284,3," Actually, the committee ""confirmed the intent"" of ASME's February 8, 1972, letter to Hydrolevel.  That letter, however, simply 
quoted the original April 29, 1971, response.  See App. 66-67. "
1285,4," The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court after finding that the damages awarded Hydrolevel were 
excessive and that the District Court had made errors in its calculation of damages.  635 F.2d, at 128-131. The damages issue is 
the subject of a pending cross-petition for certiorari, No. 80-1771, filed April 22, 1981.  Hydrolevel's damages arguments are not 
now before us, and we express no opinion on that aspect of the Court of Appeals' decision. "

professedly as agent for the other, arising from and in accordance with the other's manifestations to such third persons."" 
Restatement (Second) of Agency § 8 (1957). "
1287,6," The dissent delves into the agency law of the late 19th century and concludes that ""it was far from clear"" that a principal could 
be held liable for the deliberate torts of his agent.  Post, at 587.  But in fact, while there was a division of authority, many courts 
had made it very clear that principals could be held liable for torts analogous to the antitrust violations committed by ASME's 
agents. For instance, a treatise of that era noted that a ""considerable number of American courts"" had held the principal liable for the 
agent's fraud, though the agent acted solely for his own benefit, and praised a leading opinion for its ""singular ability and 
lucidity."" E. Huffcut, Elements of the Law of Agency § 155, p. 168 (1895).  Indeed, the author commented that the cases holding 
a principal liable when his agent acted with apparent authority and for the agent's sole benefit were ""too various to be referred to 
in detail."" Id., § 157. In holding a telegraph company liable for the fraud of its agent committed solely for his personal benefit, one court summarized 
the reasoning that became widespread during the last half of the 19th century: ""Persons receiving dispatches in the usual course 
of business, when there is nothing to excite suspicion, are entitled to rely upon the presumption that the agents intrusted with the 
performance of the business of the company have faithfully and honestly discharged the duty owed by it to its patrons, and that 
they would not knowingly send a false or forged message."" McCord v. Western Union Tel. Co., 39 Minn. 181, 185, 39 N. W. 315, 
317 (1888). See, e. g., Bank of Batavia v. New York, L.E. & W.R. Co., 106 N. Y. 195, 12 N. E. 433 (1887). LEdHN[3B][
] [3B]Thus, based on the agency law of the late 19th century, there is ample support for holding ASME liable, 
particularly since Congress intended that the antitrust laws be given broad, remedial effect.  See, e. g., Pfizer Inc. v. Government 
of India, 434 U.S. 308, 312-313 (1978). But, as we have made clear before, HN5[
] Victorian common law does not define the 
limits of the antitrust private action.  Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134 (1968) (refusing to apply 
the ancient defense of in pari delicto in antitrust cases).  We look to the general principles of the common law for guidance in 
deciding the scope of the antitrust cause of action, see National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 
679, 688 (1978), but our decisions are determined by the congressional intent that led to the enactment of the antitrust laws, a 
desire to enhance competition, see id., at 688, 691. Here, general agency principles would lead to a finding of liability if the 
violation in this case were a mere tort; and imposing liability on ASME in accord with those common-law principles honors the 
congressional intent behind the antitrust statutes. "
1288,7," Evidently, in recent years no Court of Appeals other than the Second Circuit has directly decided whether a principal can be 
held liable for antitrust damages based on an apparent authority theory.  But cf.  Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States, 
128 F.2d 227 (CA8 1942). The dissent cites several cases, stating that they appear to reject antitrust liability based on apparent 
authority. See post, at 581-582, and n. 6.  United States v. Cadillac Overall Supply Co., 568 F.2d 1078, 1090 (CA5), cert.

Sanitary Corp., 433 F.2d 174, 204 (CA3 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 948 (1971). A fair reading of those cases, however, 
reveals that they did not discuss the merits of an apparent authority theory of antitrust liability.  The dissent then dismisses other 
cases that also do not directly discuss the validity of the apparent authority theory, but that contain language approving apparent 
authority instructions, see post, at 583-584, n. 8.  United States v. Continental Group, Inc., 603 F.2d 444, 468, n. 5 (CA3 1979), 
cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1032 (1980); Continental Baking Co. v. United States, 281 F.2d 137, 150-151 (CA6 1960)."
1288,8," For example, James' employer did not overlook his usefulness as an ASME official.  In November 1973, even after the 
Hydrolevel events had taken place, an M&M executive recommended that James be retained by M&M.  The recommendation 
stated: ""A major reason for the continued success at M&M is a result of [James'] efforts and skill in influencing the various code making 
bodies to 'legislate' in favor of M&M products.  This has been a planned strategy for the business under E. N. McDonnell and 
carried out with considerable success as evidenced by the M&M market penetration of 70 plus %."" App. 86. The writer emphasized a number of James' ASME activities, including: ""Member of main boiler and pressure code committee"" 
and ""Chairman of the heating boiler sub-committee (section 4)."" Ibid. "
1289,9," ASME suggests that Hardin's response did undergo a form of committee review, because he sent copies to the chairman and 
vice chairman of the full committee.  Brief for Petitioner 8.  But there is no indication that those officers carefully scrutinized 
Hardin's response.  And certainly they will be encouraged to give responses a closer look in the future if ASME is subject to 
antitrust liability under an apparent authority theory."
1289,10," Permitting private plaintiffs to sue defendants like ASME will make that incentive especially powerful, because private suits are 
an important element of the Nation's antitrust enforcement effort: ""Congress created the treble-damages remedy . . . precisely for the purpose of encouraging private challenges to antitrust 
violations.  These private suits provide a significant supplement to the limited resources available to the Department of Justice 
for enforcing the antitrust laws and deterring violations."" Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 344 (1979) (emphasis in 
original)."
1289,11," The apparent authority rule is also consistent with the congressional desire that the antitrust laws sweep broadly.  Congress 
extended antitrust liability to ""[every] person,"" 15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 2, and defined ""person"" to include corporations and associations, 
15 U. S. C. § 7."
1289,12," ASME insists that the Court foreclosed imposition of civil antitrust liability based on apparent authority in Mine Workers v. 
Coronado Coal Co., 259 U.S. 344 (1922), and Coronado Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 268 U.S. 295 (1925). Those cases, 
however, are not controlling here.  The Court expressly pointed out: ""Here it is not a question . . . of holding out an appearance 
of authority on which some third person acts."" 259 U.S., at 395; 268 U.S., at 304-305. In fact, it noted: ""A corporation is 
responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the 
contention that torts are ultra vires of the corporation."" 259 U.S., at 395; 268 U.S., at 304. "
1290,13," The dissent argues, unconvincingly to us, that imposing antitrust liability on ASME will not advance enforcement of the 
antitrust laws. The dissent claims that the apparent authority rule will ""[encourage] plaintiffs to seek recovery from nonprofit organizations, 
rather than from the commercial enterprises that benefited from the violation."" Post, at 591.  Here, the dissent engages in 
""curious reasoning,"" see ibid., because today's decision does not encourage a plaintiff to sue any particular defendant to the 
exclusion of others; it merely lists organizations like ASME among the possible defendants in cases similar to this one.  Indeed, 
although the litigation in this case ended with ASME as the only remaining defendant, it seems likely that, in general, a plaintiff 
will prefer to bring a corporate defendant like M&M (ITT) before a jury, rather than a nonprofit organization that understandably 
may appeal to a jury's sympathies and that may not provide so deep a pocket as a commercial enterprise. In addition, the dissent insists that ASME and other such organizations cannot take steps to reduce the likelihood that antitrust 
violations like the one that occurred in this case will take place in the future.  Post, at 591-592, n. 17.  Evidently ASME does not 
agree, because it has instituted new procedures specifically in response to this suit.  See n. 15, infra.  The dissent simply refuses 
to accept that ASME and other such organizations can react to potential antitrust liability by making their associations less 
subject to fraudulent manipulation."
1290,14," A majority of courts, however, have held corporations liable for punitive damages imposed because of the acts of their agents, 
in the absence of approval or ratification. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts 12 (4th ed. 1971).  E. g., Kelite Products, Inc. v. Binzel, 
224 F.2d 131, 144 (CA5 1955) (""[The] jury may in its discretion assess punitive damages against a corporate defendant for 
oppressive acts of its agent done in the course of his employment, regardless of actual authority or ratification""); Mayo Hotel Co. 
v. Danciger, 143 Okla. 196, 200, 288 P. 309, 313 (1930) (holding corporate principal liable for punitive damages, noting that ""the 
legal malice of the servant is the legal malice of the corporation"").  In fact, the Court may have departed from the trend of late 
19th-century decisions when it issued Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101 (1893), requiring the principal's 
participation, approval, or ratification. See Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Holdfodt, 86 Ill. 455, 459 (1877) (""if the wrongful act of 
the agent is perpetrated while ostensibly discharging duties within the scope of the corporate purposes, the corporation may be 
liable to vindictive damages""); see also Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Lawrence, 74 Miss. 782, 803-805, 22 So. 53, 57-59 (1897); 
Goddard v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 57 Me. 202, 223-224 (1869). "
1291,15," Indeed, ASME has initiated procedures to protect against similar misadventures in the future.  After its experience with the 
Hydrolevel affair, ASME began issuing a publication containing all written technical inquiries pertaining to codes and their 
interpretations, a publication available through subscription.  See ASME Court of Appeals Exhibit Volume, p. 110; App. in Nos. 
79-7254, 79-7260 (CA2), pp. 784 and 804.  Apparently, ASME now gives its interpretations close scrutiny through the 
publication process.  According to the publication's foreword, ""[in] some few instances, a review of the interpretation revealed a 
need for corrections of a technical nature."" In those cases, ASME published ""a corrected interpretation . . . immediately after the 
original reply."" See Interpretations, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Foreword (No. 7: Replies to Technical Inquiries 
January 1, 1980, through June 30, 1980).  In addition, the readers are advised that ASME may reconsider its interpretation 
""when or if additional information is available which the inquirer believes might affect the interpretation."" Ibid. ASME's new procedure illustrates that the standard-setting organization itself is in the best position to prevent antitrust violations 
committed by its agents acting with apparent authority, and therefore that the policies of antitrust and agency law call for 
imposition of liability upon ASME. "
1292,*," The District Court instructed the jury that it could find petitioner liable for the acts of its members only if they acted on behalf of 
the corporation within the scope of their actual authority or if the corporation thereafter ratified or adopted their acts.  Judge 
Weinstein refused to give the apparent authority instruction proposed by respondent.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals did not 
rest on the narrow ratification theory underlying the District Court judgment, but instead reached out to decide that petitioner is 
liable for the acts of its members if those acts are found to be within their apparent authority: the jury never found liability on that 
theory and the Court of Appeals went ""out of bounds."" I regard that aspect of the Court of Appeals' opinion and that part of the 
Court's opinion today as dictum not essential to support the result reached."
1292,1," The District Court entered a judgment against ASME in an amount in excess of $ 7 million -- a sum that would destroy many 
such organizations.  By contrast McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co., commercial 
enterprises owned by International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., and the beneficiaries of the fraudulent conduct in this case, 
have settled for $ 725,000 and $ 75,000 respectively.  Curiously, the Court speaks of the ""wisdom"" of a rule that encourages 
such an inequitable result.  Ante, at 573.  The Court correctly notes that the Court of Appeals reversed the damages award "
1293,," against ASME and remanded for a new estimation.  Perhaps the final award against ASME will be substantially less than the $ 
7.5 million judgment originally entered.  Yet there is no assurance of this."
1293,2," Although associations now are viewed as being within the scope of the antitrust laws, to my knowledge this is the first case in 
which the Court has held explicitly that a nonprofit, tax-exempt association is subject to treble-damages liability.  Cf. Areeda, 
Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 455 (1981) (footnote omitted) (""[Antitrust] liability does 
not necessarily call for a damage remedy. . . .  The Supreme Court may come to agree that antitrust liability may vary according 
to the remedies sought""). ASME refers to itself as a ""society."" I use the words ""organization"" and ""association"" interchangeably to describe a broad range 
of nonprofit, membership entities and tax-exempt organizations."
1293,3," Goldfarb ""properly left to the Court some flexibility in considering how to apply traditional Sherman Act concepts to professions 
long consigned to self-regulation."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 699 (1978) 
(BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  See id., at 701 (stressing the need for ""elbow-room for realistic 
application of the Sherman Act"" to other than commercial enterprises)."
1293,4," The Court cites to several decisions, ante, at 575, n. 14, in which courts have levied punitive damages upon the principal for 
the ""unauthorized"" acts of an agent.  It is not clear that any of these decisions holds the principal liable upon the apparent 
authority of an agent acting without intent to benefit the principal.  None of them concerns the antitrust laws. None involves a 
nonprofit entity."
1293,5," ""[A] trades-union . . . might be held liable . . . but certainly it must be clearly shown in order to impose such a liability on an 
association of 450,000 men that what was done was done by their agents in accordance with their fundamental agreement of 
association."" Coronado Coal Co., 268 U.S., at 304. The Court refused to impose liability on the national union simply because it 
had the authority to discipline the local.  See Mine Workers, 259 U.S., at 395. Moreover, the Court indicated that this was not a 
case in which a theory of apparent authority might be applied -- despite the national union's power over the local and despite the 
support of the strike by the president of the national union: ""Here it is not a question of contract or of holding out an appearance 
of authority on which some third person acts."" Ibid.  The majority quotes this language, see ante, at 573, n. 12, but misses its 
point.  The Mine Workers Court well could have characterized the case before it as involving an exercise of apparent authority 
by the local union or the national president; it refused to do so.  See Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States, 128 F.2d 227, 
235 (CA8 1942) (viewing the holding in Mine Workers as rejecting an apparent authority theory of antitrust liability). "
1294,6," See United States v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 433 F.2d 174, 204 (CA3 1970); United States v. Cadillac 
Overall Supply Co., 568 F.2d 1078, 1090 (CA5 1978); United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000 (CA9 1972). Accord 
Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States, supra, at 235 (union not liable for the antitrust violations of a local division: ""To 
bind the union in a situation such as this, actual and authorized agency was necessary; mere apparent authority would not be 
sufficient""). In United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., supra, for example, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled out liability on 
apparent authority by requiring that the agent hold a ""purpose to benefit the corporation."" Id., at 1006, n. 4. In light of the rule 
adopted by the Court today, it is ironic that the Court of Appeals in Hilton Hotels considered that its rule of liability was actually a 
broad one.  Although implicitly rejecting a rule of apparent authority, the court held that a corporation could be liable for the acts 
of its agents ""even when done against company orders."" Id., at 1004. The court argued that such an expansive rule of liability 
was justified in the case before it, involving a commercial enterprise, because the Sherman Act was ""primarily concerned with 
the activities of business entities."" Ibid.  A rule promoting corporate liability was supported further by the consideration that 
antitrust violations ""are usually motivated by a desire to enhance profits,"" ""involve basic policy decisions, and must be 
implemented over an extended period of time,"" and ""if a violation of the Sherman Act occurs, the corporation, and not the 
individual agents, will have realized the profits from the illegal activity."" Id., at 1006. None of these considerations in support of a 
broad rule of liability applies to the fraudulent, self-interested conduct of ASME members in this case.  Yet the Court adopts a 
rule of liability far broader than that stated by the Ninth Circuit with such care."
1294,7," In Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107 (1893), the Court held that ""[a] principal . . . cannot be held liable for 
exemplary or punitive damages, merely by reason of wanton, oppressive or malicious intent on the part of the agent."" In a 
generally similar context, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a principal was not subject to double damages under 
the False Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. § 231, for the fraud of an agent acting without intent to benefit the principal.  See United States 
v. Ridglea State Bank, 357 F.2d 495, 500 (1966) (""[The] present action is not primarily one for the recovery of a loss caused by 
an employee, but is one which, if successful, must result in a recovery wholly out of proportion to actual loss. . . .  [The] case 
calls for the application of the rule . . . that the knowledge or guilty intent of an agent not acting with a purpose to benefit his 
employer, will not be imputed to the employer"")."
1294,8," Hydrolevel argues that Continental Baking Co. v. United States, 281 F.2d 137, 150-151 (CA6 1960), and United States v. 
Continental Group, Inc., 603 F.2d 444, 468, n. 5 (CA3 1979), support an apparent authority theory of liability in antitrust cases.  
Yet in Continental Baking the court endorsed an instruction that included an ""apparent"" authority component on the theory that a 
corporation must ""answer for [an agent's] violations of law which inure to the corporation's benefit."" There was no such benefit in 
this case.  Moreover, in Continental Group the court simply affirmed an apparent authority instruction without comment, in a 
footnote, in a case presenting many other issues.  The agents in that case were clearly acting for the benefit of their 
corporations, and the court may have considered that the apparent authority instruction, if error, was harmless. "
1295,," In any event, the comparative paucity of authority on the question of apparent authority liability in antitrust cases simply 
underscores that the Court today is making new law.  It also is doing so needlessly as ASME was neither tried nor found liable 
on the basis of apparent authority."
1295,9," Relying on a novel public policy as to nonprofit associations, the Court makes little effort to ascertain the intent of Congress 
either through examining the legislative history or the common law then existing.  Indeed, the Court implies that the agency law 
of the 19th century and ""Victorian"" common law are irrelevant.  See ante, at 568-569, n. 6.  In seeking to understand the 
Sherman Act, this Court frequently has found it necessary to ""delve"" into the history of the common law both ""Victorian"" and from 
earlier eras.  See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 51-62 (1911). The Civil Rights Acts of the 19th century were 
also the work of a ""Victorian"" Congress, yet we have looked both to the legislative history and to the common law when 
interpreting those Acts.  See, e. g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967). "
1296,10," In Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 644, n. 17 (1981), the Court stated that the rules of common 
law in effect at the time the Act was passed were relevant to an inquiry into congressional intent: ""[It] is clear that when the 
Sherman Act was adopted the common law did not provide a right to contribution among tortfeasors participating in proscribed 
conduct.  One permissible, though not mandatory, inference is that Congress relied on courts' continuing to apply principles in 
effect at the time of enactment."" The contemporary case law is relevant precisely because ""Congress . . . did not intend the text 
of the Sherman Act to delineate the full meaning of the statute or its application in concrete situations.  The legislative history 
makes it perfectly clear that it expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad mandate by drawing on common-law 
tradition."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S., at 688."
1296,11," ""Where a corporation or trustees are conducting a charity with funds devoted to that purpose, the charitable organization is not 
liable for the torts of its agents or servants, as 'it would be against all law and all equity to take those trust funds, so contributed 
for a special, charitable purpose, to compensate injuries inflicted or occasioned by the negligence of the agents or servants.'"" E. 
Huffcut, Elements of the Law of Agency § 161, pp. 176-177 (1895)."
1296,12," In describing the liability of the principal for the torts of the agent, the First Restatement of Agency, published in 1933, 
cautioned that it did not address ""any limitations upon liability because of . . . rules applicable to special classes, such as 
charitable organizations."" Restatement of Agency 458."
1296,13," The complete statement of the rule by Mechem is as follows: ""While . . . it is well settled that the principal is liable for the negligent act of his agent, committed in the course of his 
employment, it has been held in many cases, that he is not liable for the agent's willful or malicious act. . . . ""The tendency of modern cases, however, is to attach less importance to the intention of the agent and more to the question 
whether the act was done within the scope of the agent's employment; and it is believed that the true rule may be said to be that 
the principal is responsible for the wilful or malicious acts of his agent, if they are done in the course of his employment and 
within the scope of his authority; but that the principal is not liable for such acts, unless previously expressly authorized, or 
subsequently ratified, when they are done outside of the course of the agent's employment, and beyond the scope of his 
authority, as where the agent steps aside from his employment to gratify some personal animosity, or to give vent to some 
private feeling of his own"" (emphasis added, footnotes omitted). Although the concept of within ""scope of authority"" is not always easy to apply, it is beyond rational doubt that in this case the 
fraudulent activity of Hardin and James, on behalf of McDonnell & Miller, Inc., was not within the scope of any authority of 
ASME.  In addition, some courts have found that ""[a] purpose to benefit the corporation is necessary to bring the agent's acts 
within the scope of his employment."" See United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d, at 1006, n. 4. It is just such a purpose 
that was lacking in this case.  Indeed, the ""agents"" in this case were not acting simply for their own malicious purposes, they 
were acting on behalf of another principal with interests inimical to those of ASME.  It is far from clear under principles of agency 
law that Hardin and James are properly described as the ""agents"" of ASME when they act to serve a different principal and 
without any intention of benefiting ASME.  See Mechem § 67 (""A person may act as agent of two or more principals . . . if his 
duties to each are not such as to require . . . incompatible things""). "
1297,," The Court suggests that there was a division among the state courts on the question of the principal's liability for the malicious 
acts of an agent.  See ante, at 568-569, n. 6.  But there was no division in the federal courts, the courts charged with 
enforcement of the Sherman Act. In any event, surely the point is not whether every state court recognized the rule stated by this 
Court in Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 130 U.S. 416 (1889). Rather, if there was any uncertainty as to the liability of a 
commercial principal for the torts of an agent acting in the course of employment, how much clearer must it be that a nonprofit, 
voluntary association would not have been held liable in treble damages for the acts of an agent acting with apparent authority 
only."
1297,14," The Court notes that Friedlander was later overruled by Gleason v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., 278 U.S. 349 (1929). The 
relevance of this fact to Congress' intentions is not clear to me.  There is ""no federal general common law."" Erie R. Co. v. 
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938). There is no federal general law of agency.  Rather we are engaged here in an exercise in 
statutory construction.  Cf. 21 Cong. Rec. 3149 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Morgan) (""It is very true that we use common-law terms 
here and common-law definitions in order to define an offense which is in itself comparatively new, but it is not a common-law 
jurisdiction that we are conferring upon the circuit courts of the United States,"" quoted in Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff 
Materials, Inc., 451 U.S., at 644)."
1297,15," The Court responds by citing to several state law decisions indicating that in some States a principal might have been held 
liable in punitive damages for the acts of an agent.  See ante, at 575, n. 14.  I believe the Court overstates the extent to which 
19th-century state courts imposed punitive damages on the principal for the deliberate torts of an agent.  See Mechem § 751; cf. 
Mayo Hotel Co. v. Danciger, 143 Okla. 196, 200, 288 P. 309, 312 (1930) (""There are . . . respectable authorities, some of them 
recent ones, definitely holding that a corporation cannot be subjected to exemplary damages because of the malicious . . . acts 
of its agents and servants where such acts are not authorized or afterwards ratified . . . .  Many of the state courts, and a 
majority of the federal courts, expressly adhere to that doctrine"") (emphasis added).  More significantly, the Court does not make 
clear which, if any, of the state decisions it relies upon held the principal liable for punitive damages upon the apparent authority 
of an agent acting without any intention of benefiting the principal.  I had thought that this was the question before us.  And again 
the Court misses the basic point: If the rule of liability adopted by the Court today would have seemed questionable in 1890 even 
as applied to a commercial enterprise, can there be any basis for believing that Congress intended such an extreme rule of 
liability to be applied to voluntary, nonprofit associations? "
1298,16," Damages were awarded against ASME in an amount of $ 7.5 million.  By contrast, McDonnell & Miller settled the suit for less 
than a million dollars.  See n. 1, supra.  The majority's contention that ""a plaintiff will prefer to bring a corporate defendant like 
M&M (ITT) before a jury,"" ante, at 574, n. 13, is not borne out by this case.  If the Court has some other case in mind, it does not 
cite to it."
1298,17," The Court's argument that the imposition of treble damages will advance antitrust enforcement has a hollow ring in the context 
of a membership, nonprofit organization. Organizations of this kind normally function through committees composed -- as in this 
case -- of volunteers who are not employees, serve only at infrequent intervals, and are virtually uncontrollable by what usually is 
a small headquarters staff. The Court suggests that voluntary organizations can ""take steps to reduce the likelihood that antitrust violations like the one that 
occurred in this case will take place in the future."" Ibid.  The Court then refers to ""new procedures"" adopted by ASME, and 
criticizes my dissent for refusing ""to accept that ASME and other such organizations can react to potential antitrust liability by 
making their associations less subject to fraudulent manipulation."" Ibid. It would be enlightening if the Court would explain how such an association can protect itself even from ""mere tort"" liability, see 
ante, at 569, n. 6, much less the treble-damages liability imposed in this case, in light of the Court's adoption of the apparent 
authority theory of liability.  Review procedures well may be helpful to prevent mistakes made in good faith on behalf of an 
association.  But no set of rules and regulations, and no procedures however elaborate, can protect adequately against fraud 
and disloyalty.  In this case, for example, if ASME had required approval by a review committee or even by its governing body 
before the release of each of the thousands of ruling letters, a member bent on fraud could forge evidence or otherwise 
circumvent most safeguards.  In practice, a rule of apparent authority can be a rule of strict liability as the Court today holds in 
this case.  In the context of a loosely structured, voluntary nonprofit association it may be wholly impractical to adopt any 
measures that will lessen substantially the likelihood of liability, and if there is liability the Court also would impose punitive 
damages. "
1299,18," The intersection of the law of agency and vicarious liability with the law of conspiracy makes this a complex case.  Yet the 
Court does not recognize this complexity.  It so expands the concept of vicarious liability as to leave little content, in this case, to 
the requirement in § 1 of the Sherman Act that antitrust plaintiffs demonstrate a contract, combination, or conspiracy.  Indeed, 
the Court never identifies who conspired with whom.  Did James -- acting for ASME -- conspire with Hardin -- acting for 
McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.?  Or was it the other way around?  Could it be 
said, under the Court's theory, that James had conspired with himself -- as a double agent -- thereby committing both of his 
""principals"" to an antitrust conspiracy?  In my view, it makes more sense to view the matter as a conspiracy between the agents 
of McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.  The Court's theory makes possible 
ratification by ASME irrelevant.  In this light, ASME was as much a victim of this conspiracy as Hydrolevel."
1299,19," It is relevant to note that a nonprofit organization cannot reduce the burden of a treble-damages award by deducting the award 
as a business expense.  See P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 311a (1978) (""treble damages are generally a deductible 
business expense for federal income tax purposes""). "
1303,1," .   15 U.S.C. § 1 states in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.  Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony…."
1303,2," .  Defendants also premised their summary judgment motion on the ground that the injunctive and monetary relief sought 
against the Commission and its members was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Because the district court granted summary 
judgment on the basis of the Parker doctrine, it did not reach the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment barred the 
lawsuit.  Neither do we. "
1304,3," .  For a discussion of the historical background and origins of Parker, see Handler, ""The Current Attack on the Parker v. Brown 
State Action Doctrine,"" 76 Colum.L.Rev. (1976).  See also P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law 67-69 (1978); L. Sullivan, 
Antitrust 732-34 (1977)."
1304,4," .  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the highest court of a state is the ultimate interpreter of the state's statutes and 
that a federal court is bound by its construction.  Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 1885, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 
(1975); American Railway Express Co. v. Kentucky, 273 U.S. 269, 272, 47 S. Ct. 353, 354, 71 L. Ed. 639 (1927). State decisions 
are also controlling with respect to the interpretation of state administrative orders.  Sutter Butte Canal Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 
279 U.S. 125, 139, 49 S. Ct. 325, 328, 73 L. Ed. 637 (1929). We are therefore bound by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's 
holding that the Horse Racing Commission was authorized by the legislature to fix jockey fees. "
1305,5," .  The degree of articulation and expression by the legislature that is necessary was also stated in City of Lafayette v. Louisiana 
Power & Light Co., 532 F.2d 431, 434-35 (5th Cir. 1976), aff'd, 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978): (It) is not necessary to point to an express statutory mandate for each act which is alleged to violate the antitrust laws. It will 
suffice if the challenged activity was clearly within the legislative intent.  Thus, a trial judge may ascertain, from the authority 
given a governmental entity to act in a particular area, that the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of. Cited in Community Communications Co., Inc. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982) (footnote 
omitted).  In Lafayette, the Court considered an antitrust counterclaim against two Louisiana cities that allegedly pursued various 
anticompetitive activities in their operation of electric power companies.  The Court agreed that Congress did not intend to 
exempt local governments per se from antitrust scrutiny.  Justice Brennan noted that municipal decisions might express only 
""purely parochial interests"" rather than state policy. 435 U.S. at 389 at 416, 98 S. Ct. 1123 at 1138, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 .  That 
concern is not presented in the case of a state agency responsible for articulating statewide policy.  See, e.g., Metropolitan 
Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 127 Pa.Super.Ct. 11, 191 A. 678 (1937). For a general analysis of the Lafayette decision, 
see Areeda, ""Antitrust Immunity For ""State Action' After Lafayette,"" 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435 (1981)."
1305,6," .  The recent Supreme Court decision in Boulder is not controlling here.  In Boulder, the Court held that an ordinance of the City 
of Boulder, a ""home rule"" municipality with extensive powers of self-government in local and municipal matters, which restricted 
the expansion of a cable television business for three months, was not exempt from antitrust scrutiny under the state action "
1306,," exemption of Parker.  In this case, we are faced with the question of whether a state agency, not a municipality, is entitled to the 
Parker exemption when it acts within its authority under state law.  Here, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has expressly held 
that the action of the Horse Racing Commission in promulgating a fee schedule for jockeys is within the sovereign authority of 
the Commission under state law.  The importance of such a distinction was implicitly recognized by the Court in Boulder in its 
discussion of the two situations in which the state action exemption applies: Our precedents thus reveal that Boulder's moratorium ordinance cannot be exempt from antitrust scrutiny unless it constitutes 
the action of the State of Colorado itself in its sovereign capacity, see Parker, or unless it constitutes municipal action in 
furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy, see City of Lafayette, Orrin W. Fox 
Co., and Midcal. -- - U.S. at  -- , 102 S. Ct. at 839-841 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court in Boulder noted that the Parker exemption reflects Congress' intention to embody in the Sherman Act the 
federalism principle that the States possess a significant measure of sovereignty under the federal Constitution.  The Court 
noted that this principle is inherently limited in that ""we are a nation of States, a principle that makes no accommodation for 
sovereign subdivisions of states.""  -- - U.S. at  -- , 102 S. Ct. at 839 (emphasis in the original).  Boulder is instructive in this case 
insofar as it supports the proposition that interpretation of legislative intent is a matter of state law and that federal antitrust 
courts should defer to state court interpretations of such questions.   -- - U.S. at  --  nn.15 & 16, 102 S. Ct. at 841 nn. 15 & 16. "
1307,7," .  Appellants also argue the existence of disputed issues of material fact respecting the motivation behind the Commission's 
amendment of Rule 9.15 in 1978.  Again, discovery on this issue would serve no purpose.  The Supreme Court has never held 
that motivation is a factor in the ""state action"" analysis, apart from the standards outlined in Midcal.  Furthermore, this theory was 
not alleged in the Complaint.  Appendix at 5-20. "
1312,*," United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, sitting by designation."
1312,1," HN2[
] § 1 of the Sherman Act provides in part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…."
1312,2," The district court has certified a class of plaintiffs as those electrical contractors who, since July 1, 1977 have not been 
members of NECA and who perform electrical construction work using workers obtained or employed under the terms of 
collective bargaining agreements with locals of the IBEW, which agreements contain or incorporate by reference the terms of 
Article 6 of the NECA-IBEW national agreement. The plaintiffs/appellees may be referred to as NCA or as appellees."
1312,3, The defendants/appellants may be referred to as NECA or as the appellants. 
1313,4," This agreement was announced in the spring of 1976 and ratified at the October 1976 meeting of the NECA Board of 
Governors.  The agreement went into effect on July 1, 1977."
1313,5," The National Agreement provides that less than 1% of the labor payroll may be collected by the local NECA chapter, but the 
local must collect at least .2 of 1%, the amount which must be remitted to the national organization.  Both parties, as well as the 
district court, have treated the required contribution to be 1%.  The record supports a conclusion that 1% is the usual amount 
collected. "
1314,6, The dues were $ 50.00 per year with a service charge of .2% of their labor payroll after the first year of membership.
1314,7," The district court discussed at length the evidence before it which had been produced by both sides regarding the agreement.  
We need not discuss such evidence in any detail except as it applies to the issues to be dealt with later in this opinion."
1314,8," HN3[
] § 12 of the Clayton Act reads in part: Any suit, action, or proceeding under the anti-trust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business…. The parties agree that Miller and Colgan are neither inhabitants of Maryland nor are they found there. "
1315,9," This also applies to IBEW President Pillard's letter to NCA in June 1977 in which Pillard denied the interpretation of the 
agreement that NCA placed upon it, but immediately followed the denial with the statement that: ""It is true that, by July 1, 1977, 
we expect that all local IBEW-NECA agreements will have been amended to include a number of new provisions, including 
contributions to the (Industry) Fund."" "
1316,10," Appellants further claim that in actuality IBEW did not insist upon inclusion of the fund in every contract signed, and that some 
labor contracts entered into during this time did not include the industry fund.  The fact that the IBEW was somewhat less diligent 
than it might have been in enforcing the provisions of the National Agreement is not a defense, especially since the language of 
the agreement itself leaves no room for debate that the fund was to be included in all construction contracts. HN5[

(1958): HN8[
] ""because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue (such activities) are 
conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have

1318,13," In United States v. McKesson & Robbins, 351 U.S. 305, 76 S. Ct. 937, 100 L. Ed. 1209 (1956), the Court stated: ""It has been 
held too often to require elaboration now that HN11[
] price fixing is contrary to the policy of competition underlying the 
Sherman Act & that its illegality does not depend on a showing of its unreasonableness, since it is conclusively presumed to be 
unreasonable.  It makes no difference whether the motives of the participants are good or evil, whether the price fixing is 
accomplished by express contract or by some more subtle means; whether the participants possess market control; whether the 
amount of interstate commerce affected is large or small; or whether the effect of the agreement is to raise or to decrease 
prices."" "
1319,14," We are aware that, on its particular facts, this is a case of first impression and as such we should be careful in applying the 
per se rule. Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 9, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 1557, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). Cases are legion, 
however, declaring the illegality of price fixing in various forms, and the agreement here, we think, is as clear as the one struck 
down in Citizen Publishing Co. v. U. S., 394 U.S. 131, 89 S. Ct. 927, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1969). The conclusion reached by the 
Court in that case that ""(t)he joint operating agreement exposed the restraints so clearly and unambiguously as to justify the 
rather rare use of a summary judgment in the antitrust field,"" p. 136, 89 S. Ct. p. 929, is applicable here.  The Supreme Court, "
1320,," indeed, in United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969), a price fixing case ""unlike any 
other"" decided by that Court, found a per se antitrust violation in reviewing a dismissed complaint, certainly without the benefit of 
any more documents than we have available here. "

Manual (rules 401 to 470) and rule 23 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In its memorandum of decision, the court indicated 
that a ""number of informal conferences and pre-trial hearings, over a protracted period of time, have taken place in accord with 
the rules."""

an appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer to class action allegations and reversed the order, noting that the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court had adopted a manual which requires pretrial hearings in class action suits to determine class issues. "
1341,7," HN4[
]  Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides in part: ""(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder

representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and 
adequately protect the interests of the class. (b) Class Actions Maintainable.  An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are 
satisfied, and in addition: . . . [para. ] (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods 
for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. . . ."" "
1342,8," Based on section 4 of the Clayton Act, California Business and Professions Code section 16750, subdivision (a), provides in

this chapter, may sue therefor in any court having jurisdiction . . . without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover 
three times the damages sustained by him [or her], and shall be awarded a reasonable attorneys' fee together with the costs of 
suit.  [para. ] Such action may be brought by any person who is injured in his [or her] business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with the 
defendant . . . ."" In 1978 the second paragraph above was added.  Section 2 of Statutes of 1978, chapter 536, page 1696, 
provided: ""The amendment of this section at the 1978 . . . Session of the Legislature does not constitute a change in, but is

1348,9," We have carefully considered our opinion after granting a petition for rehearing and conclude that our decision as originally filed

1352,1," .  The contract between plaintiff and defendant HSA, incorporated into the complaint as an exhibit, required that ""the network,"" 
HSA, designate advertisers, determine the format of the program by which baseball games were broadcast and, with certain 
exceptions, furnish and control the placement and manner of presentation of all sponsors' commercial material."
1352,2," .  Part III of plaintiff's Complaint outlines the ""nature of trade and commerce"" involved: The sale of advertising time to 
businesses at the local, regional and national levels is the primary source of income for radio stations. A station's ability to attract 
advertisers depends on the size of its broadcast area and the number of its listeners, as well as the variety of its programming, 
the quality of advertising presentations and its prices.  The advertising rates a station can charge and the number of potential 
advertisers depend largely on the size of the listening audience as measured by ""ratings."" The effect of defendant HSA's 
cancellation of its contract with plaintiff KYST was a loss of listeners, and therefore of advertisers and revenue to KYST. "

case, like McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., 583 F.2d 1315 (5th Cir. 1978), is not one in which the question on 
jurisdiction and the merits are inextricably bound and therefore the Court need not defer ruling to the trial on the merits."
1353,4," .  Where there is, for example, a question of statutory construction arising from a conflict between federal antitrust laws and a 
regulatory scheme, the court, to imply an exemption, must find that it is ""necessary in order to make the regulatory Act work, 
""and even then the court will imply the exemption only to the minimum extent necessary.' "" Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 
U.S. 579, 597, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 3121, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976), quoting Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357, 
83 S. Ct. 1246, 1257, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963). We have long recognized that the antitrust laws represent a fundamental national economic policy and have therefore concluded 
that we cannot lightly assume that the enactment of a special regulatory scheme for particular aspects of an industry was 
intended to render the more general provisions of the antitrust laws wholly inapplicable to that industry. Carnation Company v. Pacific Westbound Conference et al., 383 U.S. 213, 218, 86 S. Ct. 781, 784, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1965). Similarly, in the case of judicially-created exemptions, ""We do not start with a clean slate, neatly balancing whether there should 
or should not be antitrust jurisdiction ….  The burden is on defendants to demonstrate that they or their practices were intended 
to be exempt or immune from the broad mandate of the Act."" United States v. American Telephone and Telegraph 
Company, et al., 461 F. Supp. 1314, 1324 (D.D.C.1978) (exemption for regulated industries).  See also Allegheny Uniforms v. 
Howard Uniform Company, et al., 384 F. Supp. 460, 463 (W.D.Pa.1974) (Parker v. Brown exemption/defense for government 
action). "
1355,5," .  The majority acknowledged that the baseball cases had not taken broadcasting revenues into account. Apart from Federal Base Ball and Toolson it would be sufficient, we believe, to rest on the allegation that over 25% of the 
revenue from championship boxing is derived from interstate operations through the sale of radio, television and motion picture 
rights. International Boxing, 348 U.S. at 247, 75 S. Ct. at 264. Justice Frankfurter noted in dissent the logical difficulty with the baseball 
exemption since ""the interstate aspects of baseball and the extent of the exploitation of baseball through mass media are far 
more extensive than is true of boxing."" Id. at 248-249, 75 S. Ct. at 265. "
1356,6," .  In United States v. Shubert, 348 U.S. 222, 228-30, 75 S. Ct. 277, 281-82, 99 L. Ed. 279 (1955) the Court, holding that 
""Toolson was a narrow application of the rule of stare decisis, (and that if) the Toolson holding is to be expanded-or contracted-
the appropriate remedy lies with Congress,"" rejected defendants', producers of theatrical attractions and operators of theatres, 
argument that businesses built around the performance of local exhibitions are exempt from the antitrust laws."
1356,7," .  A year later a federal judge in Texas applied this reasoning to baseball. Finding not that broadcasting is essential to baseball, 
but that baseball is essential to the broadcasting of baseball, he held that broadcasting of baseball was therefore covered by the 
baseball exemption. Judge Dooley commented from the bench: The telecasting simply lifts the horizon, so to speak, and brings in another set of viewers of the same identical game that those 
present in the grandstand are seeing at the same time, ordinarily, and I believe its straining reality to suggest that this television 
business has become a new facet of activity that you can look at apart from the ordinary business of baseball; and I can't follow 
that because there couldn't be such broadcasting except for the old-fashioned baseball game being played somewhere-the very 
gist and essence of the baseball business. Hale v. Brooklyn Baseball Club, Inc., Civil Action No. 1294 (N.D.Tex.1958). "
1358,8," .  Plaintiff alleges in its complaint, P 19 at p. 20, that the ""purpose of (Astros) broadcasts (is) to keep fans abreast of a game's 
developments … to promote Astro ticket sales at upcoming home games and thereby increase revenue for the Astros … (and 
to) raise revenue directly for the Astros by sales of advertising on the broadcast."" "
1359,9," .  The Court is also persuaded by plaintiff's argument that an exempt baseball team, like a labor union or agricultural cooperative 
which is exempted from the Sherman Act by statute, loses its exemption when it combines with a non-exempt radio station, 
Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, 401 U.S. 302, 91 S. Ct. 658, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1971); United States v. Concentrated Phosphate

Communications Systems, Inc. et al. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co. et al., 615 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir. 1980), rehearing

specific market. "

1368,5," An initial notice of the class action was sent to ninety-three potential class members, and stated that they would be included as 
plaintiffs in the suit unless exclusion was requested.  See I.R.C.P. 23(c)(2).  Thereafter, a second notice was sent to the potential 
class members requesting an affirmative response by checking one of two boxes indicating inclusion or exclusion.  Fifty-five 
responses to the second mailing were received, of which thirty-five requested exclusion, and twenty inclusion.  At trial, seven 
additional plaintiffs who had responded in favor of inclusion were excluded upon request, as was one plaintiff who apparently 
had not initially responded.  Although there are some fifty members of the class who have not asked for exclusion, that being the 
only method for exclusion provided for under I.R.C.P. 23(c)(2), it appears that the court below at times treated the action as 
pertaining only to the eleven insulators who affirmatively requested inclusion and who later testified at trial, see, e.g., n. 8, infra, 
and such was done even though there were twenty affirmative responses to the second notice.  See I.R.C.P. 23(c)(3).  Thus, the "
1369,," amended judgment provided that ""[each] plaintiff remaining active in this litigation at the time of the trial to the court shall be 
entitled to his share of the pool either by stipulation between all parties or by making application and providing separate proof as 
to the share each should receive."" (Emphasis added.)"
1369,6," Those insulators testifying at trial were Ron Pope, Lynn Potthast, Joseph D. Becker, Dale W. Chappell, Chris Clayville, Wayne 
T. Cottle, Kenneth Farmer, Grant T. Frederickson, Gene Hamilton, Brad L. Hanaway, and Ralph Holden."
1369,7," The motion to join IGCP as a party was made following plaintiffs' resting of their case, and following defendant's motion and 
argument in favor of an involuntary dismissal.  The defendant had argued that at a minimum all evidence pertaining to the time 
period following June 1, 1977, the date of HomeGuard's transfer to IGCP, should be excluded because IGCP was not a party to 
the suit.  Plaintiffs then moved to join IGCP.  In objection to that motion, counsel for defendant stated, ""We would not have had 
any problem with the complaint being amended prior to trial.  We would have prepared our case, therefore, in accordance with 
an amendment prior to trial.  It was not amended.  We did not prepare our case accordingly."" Tr. Vol. 4, p. 600.  The court 
granted plaintiffs' motion to join IGCP over this objection.  The court may, of course, pursuant to I.R.C.P. 21, add any party to an 
action at any stage of the proceeding so long as the terms of the joinder are just.  However, that rule does not give the court 
license to join an additional party in violation of that party's constitutional right to procedural due process.  Moore v. Knowles, 
482 F.2d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1973); Sarne v. Fiesta Motel, 79 F.R.D. 567 (D.C.Pa.1978). That right must be complied with if the 
terms of the joinder are to be just.  Consequently a party which is to be joined must be served with summons and complaint in 
accordance with I.R.C.P. 3 & 4, and be given an opportunity to respond and to defend itself.  Moore v. Knowles, supra; Sarne v. 
Fiesta Motel, supra; Blum v. Postal Telegraph, 60 F.Supp. 237 (D.C.Pa.1945). Without service of process, the court in fact has 
no jurisdiction over the purportedly joined party.  Sarne v. Fiesta Motel, supra; Bear Lake County v. Budge, 9 Idaho 703, 711-12, 
75 P. 614, 616-17 (1904); see Yellowstone Pipeline Co. v. Drummond, 77 Idaho 36, 43, 287 P.2d 288, 293 (1955). However, 
because no judgment was entered against IGCP, the question of whether the joinder of IGCP violated these standards was not 
raised on appeal, and we therefore do not reach a conclusion upon it. "
1370,8," It seems clear from the record, though not explicit in the findings of the court, that the market share percentages reflect only 
that business claimed to have been done by the testifying insulators; and does not appear to include business attributable to the 
other nontestifying class members or non-class members."
1370,9," It appears from the record that the 90% figure refers to market share before HomeGuard entered the competition, although the 
court did not specifically so state in its findings."
1370,10," The chart below indicates the final damage award and its division into submarket pools.  The numbers in parentheses indicate 
the number of insulation firms which presented testimony of their submarket share of business.  See n. 8, supra. Submarket Lost Net Profits Trebled Damages Boise (1) $ 18,039.66 $ 54,118.98 Nampa (2)"

1371,163," ,996.86 Total $ 182,583.18 $ 547,794.54 Plus costs and attorney fees in the amount of $ 51,000."
1371,11," I.C. §§ 48-101, -102, and -114 are patterned after §§ 1, 2, and 7 of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act.  Twin Falls Farm & 
City Distributing, Inc. v. D & B Supply Co., 96 Idaho 351, 354 n. 1, 528 P.2d 1286, 1289 n. 1 (1974). In interpreting and 
applying our state laws on these subjects, it is clear that while federal decisions are not binding on this Court, they do offer 
persuasive guidance.  See Southern Idaho Pipe & Steel v. Cal-Cut Pipe Co., 98 Idaho 495, 499, 567 P.2d 1246, 1250 (1977); 
Simons v. Davenport, 66 Idaho 400, 160 P.2d 464 (1945)."
1371,12," No finding of conspiracy was made under I.C. § 48-104, and consequently we do not address that issue. "
1372,13," There is also a serious question of whether IGCP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Intermountain Gas, was capable of conspiring 
with its parent corporation.  It is clear from the record that Intermountain Gas and IGCP were separate corporations, although 
tightly allied in that they shared the same directors, officers, and treasury.  Only a minority of federal circuit courts hold that, as a 
matter of law, a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary, when separately incorporated, together provide the requisite plurality of 
actors for conspiracy. See Columbia Metal Culvert Co., Inc. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 33-34 and n. 49 
(3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied 439 U.S. 876, 99 S.Ct. 214, 58 L.Ed.2d 190 (1978); H & B Equipment Co., Inc. v. International 
Harvester, 577 F.2d 239, 244-45 (5th Cir. 1978). The majority of federal circuit courts, declining to place form over substance by 
adopting a blanket rule, have held that a single enterprise defense is available where the wholly owned subsidiary is nothing 
more than the alter ego of the parent corporation.  Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581 (8th Cir. 1981); William Inglis & 
Sons Baking Co. v. I. T. T. Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 1982); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa 
Corp., 610 F.2d 614, 617-18 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied 447 U.S. 906, 100 S.Ct. 2988, 64 L.Ed.2d 855 (1980); Photovest Corp. 
v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 726-27 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied 445 U.S. 917, 100 S.Ct. 1278, 63 L.Ed.2d 601 (1980); see 
Island Tobacco Co. v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 627 P.2d 260, 273 (Hawaii 1981). However, the trial court's failure to enter 
judgment against IGCP is in effect a finding of no conspiracy between Intermountain and IGCP, and therefore it is unnecessary 
to determine at this time whether IGCP was the alter ego of Intermountain Gas and therefore incapable of conspiring with 
Intermountain Gas. "
1373,14," It should be noted that Swift & Co. v. United States, supra, was decided before Idaho adopted Section 2 of the Sherman 
Antitrust Act in 1911.  Since there is no evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, it must be presumed that Section 2 was 
adopted with the prior construction placed upon it by the United States Supreme Court's decision in Swift & Co. v. United States, 
supra. City of Weippe v. Yarno, 96 Idaho 319, 528 P.2d 201 (1974). It should also be noted that there has been some 
disagreement by one federal circuit as to what the basic elements of attempted monopoly are, differing in particular as to the 
requirement of dangerous probability. See Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied 377 U.S. 993, 
84 S.Ct. 1920, 12 L.Ed.2d 1046 but see Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Ragu Foods, Inc., 627 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1980); Janich 
Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 829, 99 S.Ct. 103, 58 L.Ed.2d 122 
(1978). "
1374,15," We note that I.C. § 48-102 does not speak in terms of prohibiting sales below cost.  The phrase ""below cost"" in the world of 
economics is, without further definition, an imprecise term, not always indicative of anticompetitive conduct.  See Areeda & 
Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697 (1975). The offense 
which Section 2 of the Sherman Act is intended to guard against under such circumstances as presented here is that of 
""predatory pricing."" One economic test for proving predatory pricing that has found favor in several federal circuits was 
developed by Areeda & Turner, supra, and employs the use of marginal and average variable costs of production.  See William 
Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. I. T. T. Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1982); Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. 
Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1980); Janich Bros. Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1977), 
cert. denied 439 U.S. 829, 99 S.Ct. 103, 58 L.Ed.2d 122 (1978); Int'l Air Industries, Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 
714, 724 (5th Cir. 1975), 424 U.S. 943 (1976). The general rule under that theory is that a price should not be considered 
predatory if it equals or exceeds the marginal cost or average variable cost of producing the product.  It is clear from the 
Areeda/Turner test that selling below average total cost, i. e., that portion of the firm's total costs -- both fixed and variable -- 
attributable on an average basis to each unit of output, does not establish predatory pricing. Recently the Ninth Circuit stated the 
following on the subject: ""Pricing below average total cost may be a legitimate means of minimizing losses, particularly when the 
firm is 'temporarily' experiencing 'excess capacity' in its productive facilities.  When this is the case, the firm's average variable 
cost -- the sum of those costs that vary with output divided by the total units of output -- generally will be less than the firm's 
marginal cost -- the variable cost associated with producing the last unit of output.  Prices below the average total cost of 
production, but above the average variable cost, may represent a legitimate means of minimizing losses during the period of 
inadequate demand."" William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. I. T. T. Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1035 (9th Cir. 
1981). "
1375,16," Respondents argue that selling back at a profit was really an illegal rebate under I.C. § 48-110.  First, this section was never 
asserted at trial, and the trial court made no findings upon it.  Second, I.C. § 48-110 refers to rebates obtained by a common 
carrier to transport property at less than a legally allowed rate.  While this section might have some bearing upon the McBride 
contract, there is nothing in the record to indicate its relevancy to Intermountain/Owens Corning transactions.  As for its 
relevance to the McBride contract, there is nothing in the record to indicate that any consideration other than that stated in the 
contract was passed between Intermountain and McBride. "
1377,17," This figure is based upon the gross sales figures of nine of the testifying plaintiffs compared against the gross sales figures of 
the HomeGuard operation.  It is clear that not only does this calculation not include all of the testifying plaintiffs, but it also does 
not include any of the business performed by the other eighty-two potential class members who were notified of the class action. 
Thus the 24% figure is more than liberal. "
1378,18," Although the Supreme Court also found a violation of section 1 for conspiracy to restrain trade, it is clear from the above 
quote that the result would have been the same absent a section 1 violation of conspiracy, and that the restraint of trade 
involved had an independent bearing upon the section 2 violation. "
1379,19," In regard to the source of Intermountain's funding of the insulation business, it is clear that only stockholder funds in the form 
of retained earnings were utilized and that none of Intermountain's nonutility business affected charges to ratepayers.  William 
Glynn, chief financial officer of Intermountain Gas, testified under questioning by plaintiff appellants' counsel that Intermountain 
kept carefully segregated utility and non-utility accounts, that the PUC set utility rates based only on the utility accounts and 
costs of utility service, and that the insulation business was financed out of stockholder funds in the form of retained earnings, 
and not from any source which might be termed ""ratepayer funds."" "
1380,20," Note 15, supra, discussing ""selling below cost"" is also applicable to the use of ""selling at a loss"" as a standard for proving 
antitrust violations."
1380,21," Injury arising out of a defendant's antitrust violation is an element of proof in establishing civil liability under I.C. § 48-114, 
since injury to a person's business is essential to the cause of action.  See, e.g., Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co. v. Sunkist 
Growers, Inc., 346 F.2d 1012, 1014 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied 382 U.S. 958, 86 S.Ct. 433, 15 L.Ed.2d 362 (1965). In view of 
our conclusion concerning the alleged antitrust violations in the liability section of this opinion, it is unnecessary to further 
address the question of liability as it relates to the requirement of injury to business.  However, we discuss the question of 
damages at this point to show that even lacking a failure of proof as to liability, the judgment would still have to be reversed on 
the separate basis that proof of damages is lacking. "
1381,22," It should be noted that had such a finding been made, of necessity any claim of conspiracy between Intermountain Gas and 
IGCP would have to fail.  See note 13, supra. "
1382,23," Norman Leavitt, a regional manager for HomeGuard, testified as follows: ""Q.  Is there a reason why the highest percentage of your product was sold in the Idaho Falls area? ""A.  Yes, sir. ""Q.  What was that reason? ""A.  I couldn't match the price [in the Pocatello area].  I was told when I went over there that I either sold it at the price set -- 
and consequently that's why I could get a better price out of it by going to Idaho Falls and still make, mark it up enough to 
pay for my travel time to go to Idaho Falls. ""Q.  Were you underbid in Pocatello? ""A.  Every day. ""Q.  As to Pocatello and the surrounding area, excluding Idaho Falls, what percentage during your tenure there at Idaho 
Falls, what percentage of the bids did you obtain or not obtain? ""A.  Residential bids, I would assume or guess that I probably obtained in the neighborhood of 25 per cent of the bids that I 
did give. ""Q.  And you lost 75 per cent then? ""A.  Yes, sir. ""Q.  In the Idaho Falls area would that figure be different? ""A.  The Idaho Falls area we probably got 40 per cent of the ones we gave."" Tr., Vol. 4, pp. 638-39. It should be noted that none of the plaintiff witnesses were insulators from the Idaho Falls area. Joseph Becker, a Pocatello insulator, testified as follows: ""Q.  Mr. Becker, what do you mean by you refused to lower your price; in comparison to what? ""A.  Well, below cost or down to cost. ""Q.  And who was -- ""A.  Consequently I lost percentages of the market area. ""Q.  And who gained them as a result of that? ""A.  Mr. Holden [Okay Insulation].  And hearing his testimony, he tried to meet cost competition.  I didn't.  If I was just in the 
insulation business, I might have had to look at it differently.  But I don't believe that one phase of the business should be 
run at cost or below just to say that you are in it. ""Q.  What was the cost or below, the competition that you had to meet? ""A.  I believe it was HomeGuard and Okay Insulation. ""Q.  All right.  And Mr. Cottle? ""A.  If they were meeting it."" Tr. Vol. 4, p. 543 (emphasis added). Dale Chappell, a Nampa insulator, testified as follows: ""Q.  What is your market area? ""A.  Basically the Nampa and Caldwell area. ""Q.  Now, in that relationship have you encountered any competition within the last two years? ""A.  Yes.  We had a lot of competition in the last two years. ""Q.  What is that? "
1383,," ""A.  Basically new insulation companies coming in and especially competition lowering prices. ""Q.  What has that been, Mr. Chappell? ""A.  The companies? ""Q.  Yes. ""A.  Well, HomeGuard is one of them.  . . . ."" Tr. Vol. 4, pp. 545-46 (emphasis added). "
1384,24," HN25[
] ""RULE 23(b).  CLASS ACTIONS MAINTAINABLE.  -- An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: ""(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of . . . . ""(B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the

individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the 
controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the 
litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action."" "
1385,25, It is assumed for the purposes of this discussion that the prerequisites of I.R.C.P. 23(a) are met in this case. 
1386,26," While many of the cases denying certification on this basis involve thousands of potential class members, the same principles 
have been applied to deny certification of much smaller groups as well.  See, e.g., Shaw v. Mobil Oil Co., 60 F.R.D. 566 
(D.N.H.1973)."
1386,27, Bud Moore was the only designated class representative not testifying at trial.
1386,28," The statute of limitations on these claims was tolled by the class action proceedings up to this point.  See American Pipe & 
Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974). ""[The] rule most consistent with . . . class action 
procedure must be that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted 
members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action."" Id. at 554, 94 
S.Ct. at 766. "
1387,1," Intermountain did not seek or obtain the approval of the Public Utilities Commission prior to entering this secondary market.  In 
fact, the P.U.C. ordered Intermountain to divest itself of a different retail business in IPUC Order No. 11507 (reversed for failure 
to give adequate notice in Intermountain Gas Co. v. Idaho Public Utilities Commission, 97 Idaho 113, 540 P.2d 775 (1975))."
1387,2," The majority does assert that Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 (1973), 
supports its conclusion that an anti-trust plaintiff must show (1) monopoly power, (2) an actual restraint of trade, and (3) restraint 
within the relevant distribution chain before the plaintiff may recover from a regulated utility.  Otter Tail does not support these 
conclusions.  The fact that an actual restraint was proven in Otter Tail does not mean that such is a requirement under I.C. § 48-
102.  The Court in Otter Tail specifically stated that ""[the] record makes abundantly clear that Otter Tail used its monopoly power 
in the towns in its service area to foreclose competition or gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor, all in 
violation of the antitrust laws."" 410 U.S. at 377, 93 S.Ct. at 1029 (emphasis added).  Here, IGCP clearly gained an advantage 
over its competitors in the secondary market by virtue of its access to and use of Intermountain Gas's monopoly dollars."
1387,3," The majority chooses to characterize these funds as ""retained earnings"" rather than ratepayer dollars. The funds originated 
from ratepayers, however, and the fact that they were not immediately disbursed to shareholders does not change that fact. "
1388,4," United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 68 S.Ct. 941, 92 L.Ed. 1236 (1948). "
1389,5," But see majority opinion, supra. "
1404,1," The price list available at Glenn's Flooring contained all the increased prices of installation, except the ten dollar increase in the 
minimum charge.  The minimum charge increase was not incorporated into the price list because it did not meet with the 
approval of North Avenue."
1404,2," The defendant also filed separate motions to dismiss the indictments pursuant to section 16-5-204(4)(k), C.R.S. 1973 (1978 
Repl. Vol. 8), for lack of probable cause.  The district court denied these motions and this ruling is not before us at this time."
1404,3," The court's ruling, in pertinent part, states: ""The theme of the alleged conspiracy is the agreement among the conspirators to raise the prices for 'floor covering 
installation services.' ""If this postulation is permissible, then the integrity of the indictment is impregnable because the designation of floor 
covering as services obviates the bar of the labor exemption specifically provided in the statute.  Neither reason nor logic 
support such an arbitrary classification; this operational bootstrap indicates quite clearly a benighted understanding of the 
nature of floor covering work; reason and logic, as well as cursory observation, support the conclusion that such work is at 
least as much 'labor' as plumbing, carpentering, welding or any other of the building trades; the attorney general 
ingenuously urges that the exemption provided by CRS 1973 6-4-103 (2) ""THE LABOR OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT A 
COMMODITY OR ARTICLE OF COMMERCE"" was provided for the peculiar benefit of union 'laborers' as distinct from "
1405,," others; arguendo - collective bargaining agreements have no impact on prices or competition, but all other agreements do; 
in the avoidance of constitutional infirmity, trial courts may only follow a plain reading of the statutory exemptions; the 
suggestion of the attorney general that the federal judiciary 'carved out' a consensus that this exemption referred only to 
'union labor' to the exclusion of any other 'labor' is not binding upon state courts."" In rejecting the decisions of the United States Supreme Court construing the federal labor exemption in antitrust litigation, the 
district court relied on Q-T Markets, Inc. v. Fleming Companies, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 1102 (D. Colo. 1975), which considered the 
application of the Colorado antitrust statute to a tying arrangement between a retail food supplier and a retail food operator.  The 
federal district court, interpreting the words of section 6-4-101 in a literal manner and focusing on minor differences between the 
Colorado statute and the Sherman Act, ruled that ""it would be unwarranted to assume that the Colorado legislature intended to 
adopt the case law interpreting the Federal statutes,"" 394 F. Supp. at 1106, and concluded that tying agreements were not 
prohibited under the Colorado statute.  We believe, however, that federal and state antitrust statutes serve complementary 
purposes and, in view of their common goals of preserving free competition and protecting the public against illegal restraints of 
trade, the antitrust decisions of the United States Supreme Court are entitled to careful consideration in determining the meaning 
and scope of the Colorado statute.  We therefore reject the contrary assumption implicit in Q-T Markets. See Note, Colorado 
Antitrust Law: Untied and Drifting, 48 Colo. L. Rev. 215 (1977)."
1405,4," In opposing the defendants' motion to dismiss, the attorney general filed with the district court the affidavit of David J. Clarke 
who drafted the Colorado Antitrust Statute. The affidavit, after reciting Clarke's service with the Antitrust Division of the United 
States Department of Justice from 1938 to 1948 and his election to the state senate in 1956, continues, in pertinent part: ""I decided that the antitrust statute enacted in Wisconsin, as set forth in a volume of state antitrust laws, prepared by the 
Marketing Laws Survey and published as a WPA project in 1940, provided the best model.  A copy of the Wisconsin law is 
attached hereto as Exhibit A.  The volume is held at the library of the University of Denver College of Law, No. T 14, M 
3452S. ""I then drafted the bill which was subsequently enacted as Senate Bill No. 200 using the Wisconsin statute as a model. ""In drafting this legislation it was my intent to follow the substantive provisions of the Wisconsin statute so that any Court 
decisions interpreting the Wisconsin statute could be cited to the Colorado courts. ""I did make certain changes regarding the penalties to be applied, such as the elimination of the provision for treble 
damages in civil cases, because I thought the new statute should be 'on the books' for a while before private actions for 
treble damages could be instituted. ""To the best of my recollection, Senate Bill No. 200 was enacted without amendment as I drafted it."""
1405,5," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in part, that ""every contract, combination . . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976). Section 3 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 3 (1976) similarly proscribes activities in ""restraint of trade or commerce."""
1405,6," Section 6 of the Clayton Act, after declaring that ""the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce,"" states 
that the antitrust laws shall not be construed to forbid the existence of labor, agricultural or horticultural organizations, instituted 
for the purposes of mutual help.  15 U.S.C. § 17 (1976). Section 20 of the Clayton Act prohibits federal courts from issuing 
injunctions in employment disputes concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable 
injury to a property right.  29 U.S.C. § 52 (1976). "
1406,," The Wisconsin Supreme Court consistently has construed the Wisconsin antitrust statute in accordance with federal case law.  
See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Waste Management, 81 Wis. 2d 555, 261 N.W.2d 147 (1977), cert. denied sub nom.  Waste 
Management of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Wisconsin, 439 U.S. 865, 99 S. Ct. 189, 58 L. Ed. 2d 175 (1978); John Mohr & Sons, Inc. 
v. Jahnke, 55 Wis. 2d 402, 198 N.W.2d 363 (1972); Pulp Wood Co. v. Green Bay Paper & Fiber Co., 157 Wis. 604, 147 N.W. 
1058 (1914), cert. denied 249 U.S. 610, 39 S. Ct. 291, 63 L. Ed. 800 (1919)."
1406,7," The Norris-LaGuardia Act ""explicitly formulated the 'public policy of the United States' in regard to the industrial conflict, and by 
its light established that the available area of union activity was not to be restricted, as it had been in the Duplex case, to an 
immediate employer-employee relation."" United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 231, 61 S. Ct. 463, 466, 85 L. Ed. 788, 792-
93 (1941). Thus, the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts must be read as interlacing statutes in determining whether 
union or employee conduct constitutes an antitrust violation.  Id. "
1408,8," In our decisions construing Colorado's prior antitrust statute, we have held that trade restraints in connection with service-
oriented industries were subject to antitrust prosecution.  See, e.g., People v. Apostolos, 73 Colo. 71, 213 P. 331 (1923) (shoe 
repair); Johnson v. People, 72 Colo. 218, 210 P. 843 (1922) (electrical contracting); Campbell v. People, 72 Colo. 213, 210 P. 
841 (1922) (plumbing). "
1410,9," Even if businessmen organize themselves into a union, they cannot on that account immunize themselves from antitrust 
prosecution.  As the Supreme Court observed in Los Angeles Local 626 v. United States, 371 U.S. 94, 101-102, 83 S. Ct. 162, 
166, 9 L. Ed. 2d 150, 155-56 (1962): ""The narrow question which emerges in this case, therefore, is whether businessmen who combine in an association which 
would otherwise be properly subject to dissolution under the antitrust laws can immunize themselves from that sanction by 
the simple expedient of calling themselves 'Local 626-B' of a labor union. We think there is nothing in the Norris-LaGuardia 
Act nor in the Clayton Act, nor in the federal policy which these statutes reflect, to prevent a court from dissolving the ties

present case."""
1410,*," * * ""As the District Court correctly found, the present case was not one 'involving or growing out of any labor dispute,' but one 
involving an illegal combination between businessmen and a union to restrain commerce. In such a case . . . . neither the 
Norris-LaGuardia Act nor the labor exemption provisions of the Clayton Act are applicable."" Moreover, while a collective bargaining agreement between a union and an employer, standing alone, is insufficient to form an 
illegal combination, the labor exemption may be lost when the agreement is part of a larger employer conspiracy involving 
monopolization and price-fixing, see Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 325 
U.S. 797, 65 S. Ct. 1533, 89 L. Ed. 1939 (1945), or when the union agrees with an employer to impose the same wage scale on

1414,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1 (1976)."
1414,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part that ""(e)very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or

1416,4," We reach this conclusion after reading the district court's Memorandum Opinion of April 25, 1979 in conjunction with the brief 
filed by Friendship in the district court on April 2, 1979; the transcript of the oral argument before the district court on April 19, 
1979; and the informal comments of the district judge following oral argument on April 19, 1979. "
1420,1," In its Memorandum and Order dated July 2, 1981, the Court concluded that the common law ""abuse of process"" claim set forth 
in Count VII of the complaint was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Memorandum at 5.  The Court now believes that this 
conclusion was incorrect.  The abuse of process claim was raised in the answer to the complaint in the Maryland suit.  Answer 
P35, Reinforced Earth Co. v. Neumann, Civil Action No. M-77-285 (filed March 21, 1977).  HN1[
] The tort of abuse of process 
occurs when there has been ""a perversion of court processes to accomplish some end which the process was not intended by 
law to accomplish, or which compels the party against whom it has been used to do some collateral thing which he could not 
legally and regularly be compelled to do."" Hall v. Field Enterprises, Inc., 94 A. 2d 479, 481 (D.C. Mun. Ct. 1953). A re-
examination of Judge Miller's Memorandum and Order reveals not only that the Reinforced Earth Company accomplished 
something by its suit that process was intended by law to accomplish (an injunction against Neumann from ""retaining, using, or 
disclosing"" documents belonging to The Reinforced Earth Company) but also that Judge Miller considered the abuse of process 
and malicious prosecution claims.  Indeed, he noted in his Order, dated June 16, 1978, that the issues in the case had been 
considered in a three day trial and stated emphatically: ""[N]o case and controversy between the parties exists at this date."" Thus, 
Neumann is precluded from again claiming that the Maryland litigation constituted abuse of process. This Court's July 2, 1981 
Memorandum will be amended accordingly. "

$180,000.  Defendants' Exh. AF, at 7.  The Community Enterprise Development Association report stated that Neumann needed 
a loan of $150,000, a loan for which he was not qualified.  Defendants' Exh. AG.  Moreover, Neumann, in his deposition 
testimony stated that he needed ""something like $200,000"" to get his business started. Neumann Deposition, Defendants' Exh. 
AM, at 19."
1422,5," Plaintiffs rely heavily on the fact that Hecht resulted in a jury trial and on the court of appeals' statement that it could not say as 
a matter of law that the promoters in Hecht did not have standing.  570 F. 2d at 987-88.Hecht is, however, distinguishable from 
this case on a crucial point.  In that case, the promoters had three investors with considerable financial resources.  Id. at 986. 
Evidence in that case demonstrated that the original promoters had an oral agreement with these wealthy investors whereby the 
investors would own a controlling interest in the franchise. Id. at 998. In the present case, Neumann did not even have a 
concrete oral agreement with investors capable of financing his enterprise. "
1423,," On the other hand, a case upon which the defendants rely, Martin v. Phillips Petroleum Co., supra, is persuasive authority for the 
grant of summary judgment in this case.  In Martin, the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on facts analogous to those in this 
case, found that ""there was a complete failure to demonstrate the necessary 'preparedness'"" to enter a new line of business.  
365 F. 2d at 633. Consequently, it affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment. Id. at 635. Martin, which has been 
cited favorably by the court of appeals in Hecht, supra, 570 F. 2d at 987 n. 10, 994 n. 52, supports the grant of summary 
judgment in this case."
1423,6," It must also be noted that almost four years have elapsed since the termination of the Maryland litigation on June 5, 1978.  The 
opinion in that case generally vindicated Neumann.  See Reinforced Earth Company v. Neumann, No. M-77-285, opinion (D. 
Md. June 5, 1978).  Despite the resolution of the lawsuit and the passage of time, Neumann has still not been able to secure "
1424,," financing or to enter into a contract with an investor. If the Maryland litigation was the sole cause of his inability to obtain 
financing, surely the resolution of that litigation would have allowed his financing plans to go forward.  This has not happened.  
Plaintiffs' contention that there has been a cloud on his prospective patent caused by the Maryland litigation and the subsequent 
protest of his patent application is without merit because his own actions primarily caused the delay in adjudication of this issue. "

are hereby declared unlawful. (b) Whenever the attorney general shall believe from evidence satisfactory to him that any person, firm, corporation or 
association or agent or employee thereof has engaged in or is about to engage in any of the acts or practices stated to be 
unlawful he may bring an action in the name and on behalf of the people of the state of New York to enjoin such unlawful acts or 
practices and to obtain restitution of any moneys of property obtained directly or indirectly by any such unlawful acts or practices.  
In such action preliminary relief may be granted under article sixty-three of the civil practice law and rules. "
1432,," (c) Before any violation of this section is sought to be enjoined, the attorney general shall be required to give the person against 
whom such proceeding is contemplated notice by certified mail and an opportunity to show in writing within five business days 
after receipt of notice why proceedings should not be instituted against him, unless the attorney general shall find, in any case in 
which he seeks preliminary relief, that to give such notice and opportunity is not in the public interest. HN3[
] (d) In any such action it shall be a complete defense that the act or practice is, or if in interstate commerce would be, 
subject to and complies with the rules and regulations of, and the statutes administered by, the federal trade commission or any 
official department, division, commission or agency of the United States as such rules, regulations or statutes are interpreted by 
the federal trade commission or such department, division, commission or agency or the federal courts. (e) Nothing in this section shall apply to any television or radio broadcasting station or to any publisher or printer of a newspaper, 
magazine or other form of printed advertising, who broadcasts, publishes, or prints the advertisement. (f) In connection with any proposed proceeding under this section, the attorney general is authorized to take proof and make a 
determination of the relevant facts, and to issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil practice law and rules. HN4[
] (g) This section shall apply to all deceptive acts or practices declared to be unlawful, whether or not subject to any other 
law of this state, and shall not supersede, amend or repeal any other law of this state under which the attorney general is 
authorized to take any action or conduct any inquiry. (h) In addition to the right to action granted to the attorney general pursuant to this section, any person who has been injured by 
reason of any violation of this section may bring an action in his own name to enjoin such unlawful act or practice and to recover 
his actual damages or fifty dollars, whichever is greater.  The court may, in its discretion, increase the award of damages to an 
amount not to exceed three times the actual damages up to one thousands dollars, if the court finds the defendant willfully or 
knowingly violated this action.  The court may award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff."

forfeited its charter, or carried on, conducted or transacted its business in a persistently fraudulent or illegal manner, or by the 
abuse of its powers contrary to the public policy of the state has become liable to be dissolved.  HN9[
] N.Y.Exec.Law § 63(12) (McKinney Supp. 1972-80) states: "
1433,," Whenever any person shall engage in repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or otherwise demonstrate persistent fraud or illegality in 
the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business, the attorney general may apply, in the name of the people of the state of 
New York, to the supreme court of the state of New York, on notice of five days, for an order enjoining the continuance of such 
business activity or af any fraudulent or illegal acts, directing restitution and damages and, in an appropriate case, cancelling any 
certificate filed under and by virtue of the provisions of section four hundred forty of the former penal law or section one hundred 
thirty of the general business law, and the court may award the relief applied for or so much thereof as it may deem proper.  The 
word ""fraud"" or ""fraudulent"" as used herein shall include any device, scheme or artifice to defraud and any deception, 
misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, false pretense, false promise or unconscionable contractual provisions.  The term 
""persistent fraud"" or ""illegality"" as used herein shall include continuance or carrying on of any fraudulent or illegal act or conduct. In connection with any such proposed application, the attorney general is authorized to take proof and make a determination of 
the relevant facts and to issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil practice law and rules. "
1434,3," HN13[
] A fraud action under New York common law requires proof of the traditional five elements: misrepresentation of a 
material fact, falsity of that representation, scienter, reliance, and damages.  See Mallis v. Bankers Trust Co., 615 F.2d 68, 80 
(2d Cir. 1980), Jo Ann Homes, Inc. v. Dworetz, 25 N.Y.2d 112, 119, 250 N.E.2d 214, 217, 302 N.Y.S.2d 799, 803 (1969). "

97 S. Ct. 74 (1976), where the Third Circuit harshly criticized the trial court's reliance on proof of ""acceptance by large numbers 
of buyers of a burdensome or uneconomic tie"" as establishing the illegal use of economic power by the franchisor. "
1476,1," As used in this opinion, ""direct purchaser"" means one who purchased industrial gas directly from one of the defendants and 
sold the gas directly or indirectly to one of the real parties or to a member of the class they seek to represent. "
1477,2," As used in this opinion, ""intermediate supplier"" means any party who forms a link in the chain of distribution connecting the 
""direct purchaser"" with one of the real parties or with a member of the class they seek to represent. "
1478,3," As used in this opinion, ""indirect purchaser"" includes either an ""intermediate supplier"" or end user/consumer."
1478,4," In their opposition brief, real parties contend that joinder is not required because plaintiffs do not necessarily know the identities 
of all the purchasers in the chain of distribution and because joinder of certain direct purchasers might cause the action to be 
removed to federal court; if the court were deprived of jurisdiction, joinder could not take place. These two arguments are 
unpersuasive. Implicitly, Code of Civil Procedure section 389 requires joinder only of parties known or reasonably discoverable. 
Subdivision (c) requires the pleader to state the names of nonjoined persons who qualify for joinder under subdivision (a) ""if 
known."" Subdivision (b) permits the court to proceed without these known persons in some circumstances. The same 
allowances should be made for unknown persons, who for obvious reasons cannot be served. The removal argument is circular. 
Removal would not take place until joinder had been accomplished. Removal is hardly a catastrophic result, in any case, 
because the federal court would apply state antitrust law to the indirect purchaser lawsuit brought thereunder. "
1479,5," Although Bank of California arose under a prior version of Code of Civil Procedure section 389, the Law Revision Commission 
Comment printed with the present statute explains that the guidelines of the new law ""are substantially those that have guided 
the courts for years. See Bank of California v. Superior Court, 16 Cal.2d 516, 106 P.2d 879 (1940)."" (Cal. Law Revision Com. 
com. to Code Civ. Proc., § 389, 1971 Amendment, 14 West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1973 ed.) p. 223, Deering's Ann. Code Civ. 
Proc. (1972 ed.) pp. 432-433.) "
1481,6," Petitioners contend that the requirement of particularized pleading in anticipation of the statute of limitations should be enforced 
here because otherwise real parties will be permitted to seek discovery concerning injuries ""stretching back through the endless 
corridors of time, . . . "" However, it is only through this discovery that real parties can uncover the beginnings of the alleged 
conspiracy which they assert has been concealed by petitioners. The situation differs markedly from one in which the complaint 
alleges an open or public injurious act and that there has been concealment from the plaintiff of the defendant's involvement or 
of the as-yet-unrealized injurious consequences of the act. By its nature, a conspiracy to fix prices in violation of antitrust law is 
a secret act whose effects are public. Only through discovery or chance disclosure can an antitrust plaintiff learn about the 
actions leading to the observable effects. "

] (b) How Presented.  Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, 
cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following 
defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: … (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."

permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days, after the service of the pleading upon him or upon the 
court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, 
immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."

price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, 
wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the

also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier."" 
Northern Pacific Railway Company v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). HN7[
] Tying arrangements are subject to attack under both the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, see notes 3 & 4, supra, with 
application of the Clayton Act being limited to the sale or lease of commodities.  Further, the practice of tying the sale of one 
product to the buyer's purchase of a second or tied product is currently subject to a rule of per se illegality. See Northern Pacific 
Railway Company, supra, 356 U.S. at 9, 78 S. Ct. at 520 (1958). That tying is subject to per se illegality does not mean that the 
antitrust plaintiff succeeds merely by showing the existence of a tie-in. Rather, the plaintiff ""must also prove that the tie-in 
involves a not insubstantial amount of commerce in the tied product market and that the seller has appreciable market power 
over the tying product."" Baker, The Supreme Court and the Per Se Tying Rule: Cutting the Gordian Knot, 66 Va.L.Rev. 1235 
(1980). Under a per se approach, once the antitrust plaintiff has shown these elements, the practice is ""condemned without 
inquiry into its actual competitive effect."" Id. at 1237. The per se rule of antitrust illegality is to be distinguished from the rule of 
reason approach, which would evaluate a challenged practice on the basis of its actual impact on competition.  See L. Sullivan, 
Handbook on the Law of Antitrust 171-74 (1977).  Professor Baker argues that certain tensions inherent in a per se approach to 
tying illegality as a result of a more economic approach to antitrust law by the Court may result in a move closer to rule of 
reason analysis.  See generally Baker, supra."
1489,6," .  At the time relevant to the suit, section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provided: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee. "

that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an 
immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in 
such order.  The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is 
made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay 
proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order."

upon an express direction for the entry of judgment."

four years after the cause of action accrued.  No cause of action barred under existing law on the effective date of this section

participating in certain patent pools, restricting Zenith's operations in a manner violative of the antitrust laws. In rejecting 
Hazeltine's argument that 15 U.S.C. § 15b permits recovery only of those damages caused by overt acts committed during the 
four-year period, the Court stated that ""(generally), a cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant 
commits an act that injures a plaintiff's business."" 401 U.S. at 338, 91 S. Ct. at 806. The Court observed, however, that when a 
continuous antitrust violation is alleged, a cause of action accrues each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants: "
1492,," In the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws … each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants 
a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and … as to those damages, the statute of 
limitations runs from the commission of the act."

manufacturer and distributor, claiming that the defendant's policy of leasing and refusing to sell its shoe machinery was an 
instrument of unlawful monopolization.  The defendant argued that it first refused to sell its machinery to the plaintiff in 1912, and 
plaintiff was, therefore, barred from bringing its suit in 1955 by the applicable Pennsylvania statute of limitations. The Supreme 
Court agreed with the Third Circuit's rejection of this argument: We are not dealing with a violation which, if it occurs at all, must occur within some specific and limited time span….  Rather, we 
are dealing with conduct which constituted a continuing violation of the Sherman Act and which inflicted continuing and 
accumulating harm on (the plaintiff)."

certain date, future damages that might arise from the conduct sued on are unrecoverable if the fact of their accrual is 
speculative or their amount and nature unprovable."

and sole stockholder.  Drexel Properties owned the actual condominium units and Mangurian owned the adjacent land on which 
recreational facilities had been built.  Mangurian leased the land to Drexel Properties and contracts of sale for the units required 
that each purchaser accept assignment from Drexel Properties of an undivided interest of a portion of the lease, and assume an 
obligation to Mangurian for rent. "
1493,," We noted that in Imperial Point, the tying arrangement was different from the typical single-defendant tie-in because the unit 
owners agreed with one defendant to buy the tying product (the condominium), and agreed with another defendant to assume 
an obligation to pay rent for the tied product (the recreational facilities).  549 F.2d at 1042-43. We held that the defendant could 
not ""escape suit via the statute of limitations by splitting itself into two separate legal entities and causing one of them to force 
plaintiff to buy the tied product from the other one."" Id. at 1043 n. 24. "

opinion. "
1496,16," .  Although the Ninth Circuit held that the antitrust claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because of the ""necessarily 
continuing nature of the alleged harm,"" 512 F.2d at 1270, it dismissed the tying cause of action because two separate products 
were not involved in the alleged tie-in. Id. at 1276."

example, von Kalinowski states: ""Although not expressly overruling the Continental Wall Paper case, the Kelly Court abandoned "
1499,," the distinction made … (in Continental ) between contracts inherently illegally and those which are only collateral to the alleged 
activities."" 15 von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 109.06 at 109.37 (1981)."
1499,20," .  Kaiser also argued that because performance under the contract is now complete, and not executory, Avondale cannot 
interpose the antitrust defense.  This position must be rejected because of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Mullins.  The 
Court affirmed the Kelly standard, but rejected the view that application of the restrictive approach of Kelly was contingent on 
whether the contract was executory or not. "
1500,21," .  Kaiser claims that Carpa goes further than Kaiser requires because while Kaiser wants to recover the uninflated price 
allegedly due to it under the changes provision, Carpa ""recognized the right of an alleged antitrust violator to recover amounts 
due and owing on that cancelled lease, even though a portion of those amounts constituted antitrust damages."" Kaiser br. at 27.  
The language in Carpa upon which Kaiser relies provides: The lease, as well as the accounts receivable allowed as offsets, were sufficiently collateral to the tying arrangement to be 
enforceable, even though a portion of the amounts paid for the lease and the goods sold constituted antitrust damages.  The 
purchases themselves were not illegal, only the requirement to purchase and the contractual sanctions for failure to do so were 
violative of the Sherman Act."
1500,536," F.2d at 54 (emphasis supplied).  This language, however, must be read in context with a statement that appears in the 
same paragraph: ""Plaintiffs received tangible items from one who possessed title to the goods, and the law presumes the 
expectation of paying a reasonable price for them."" Id. at 55 (emphasis supplied). "
1501,," We do not need to construe Carpa for present purposes.  Nevertheless, we are compelled to observe that the two quotes cited 
above are consistent with the view that the franchisor can sue for items purchased by the franchisee at inflated prices, but that 
the franchisor cannot recover more than the ""reasonable price"" for these items. "

1547,1," The complaint alleged a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act as well as of the Arizona antitrust statute.  The state statute is 
interpreted in conformity with the federal statute.  643 F.2d 533, 554, n. 1 (CA9 1980). The State of Arizona prayed for an 
injunction but did not ask for damages."
1547,2," The District Court offered three reasons for its decision.  First, citing Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 
(1977), the court stated that ""a recent antitrust trend appears to be emerging where the Rule of Reason is the preferred method 
of determining whether a particular practice is in violation of the antitrust law."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.  Second, ""the two 
Supreme Court cases invalidating maximum price-fixing, [Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211 
(1951), and Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145 (1968)], need not be read as establishing a per se rule."" Id., at 44.  Third, ""a 
profession is involved here."" Id., at 45.  Under the rule-of-reason approach, the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on 
the issue of liability could not be granted ""because there is insufficient evidence as to the [purpose and effect of the allegedly 
unlawful practices and the power of the defendants.]"" Id., at 47. The District Court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss based on the ground that they were engaged in the business of 
insurance within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1011 et seq. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-41.  The 
defendants did not appeal that portion of the District Court order.  643 F.2d, at 559, and n. 7."
1547,3," The quoted language is the Court of Appeals' phrasing of the question.  Id., at 554. The District Court had entered an order on 
June 5, 1979, providing, in relevant part: ""The plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability is denied with leave to file a similar motion based on 
additional evidence if appropriate."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 48. On August 8, 1979, the District Court entered a further order providing: ""The Order of this Court entered June 5, 1979 is amended by addition of the following: This Court's determination that the Rule 
of Reason approach should be used in analyzing the challenged conduct in the instant case to determine whether a violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act has occurred involves a question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and an immediate appeal from the Order denying plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability 
may materially advance the ultimate determination of the litigation.  Therefore, the foregoing Order and determination of the 
Court is certified for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292(b)."" Id., at 50-51. "
1548,4," Judge Sneed explained his reluctance to apply the per se rule substantially as follows: The record did not indicate the actual 
purpose of the maximum-fee arrangements or their effect on competition in the health care industry.  It was not clear whether the 
assumptions made about typical price restraints could be carried over to that industry.  Only recently had this Court applied the 
antitrust laws to the professions.  Moreover, there already were such significant obstacles to pure competition in the industry that 
a court must compare the prices that obtain under the maximum-fee arrangements with those that would otherwise prevail rather 
than with those that would prevail under ideal competitive conditions.  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit had not applied Kiefer-
Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211 (1951), and Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145 (1968), to 
horizontal agreements that establish maximum prices; some of the economic assumptions underlying the rule against maximum 
price fixing were not sound."
1548,5," Judge Kennedy's concurring opinion concluded as follows: ""There does not now appear to be a controlling or definitive analysis of the market impact caused by the arrangements under 
scrutiny in this case, but trial may reveal that the arrangements are, at least in their essentials, not peculiar to the medical 
industry and that they should be condemned."" 643 F.2d, at 560."
1548,6," Judge Larson stated, in part: ""Defendants formulated and dispersed relative value guides and conversion factor lists which together were used to set an upper 
limit on fees received from third-party payors.  It is clear that these activities constituted maximum price-fixing by competitors. 
Disregarding any 'special industry' facts, this conduct is per se illegal.  Precedent alone would mandate application of the per se 
standard. ""I find nothing in the nature of either the medical profession or the health care industry that would warrant their exemption from 
per se rules for price-fixing."" Id., at 563-564 (citations omitted)."
1548,7," Most health insurance plans are of the fee-for-service type.  Under the typical insurance plan, the insurer agrees with the 
insured to reimburse the insured for ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" medical charges.  The third-party insurer, and the 
insured to the extent of any excess charges, bears the economic risk that the insured will require medical treatment.  An 
alternative to the fee-for-service type of insurance plan is illustrated by the health maintenance organizations authorized under 
the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, 42 U. S. C. § 300e et seq.  Under this form of prepaid health plan, the "
1549,," consumer pays a fixed periodic fee to a functionally integrated group of doctors in exchange for the group's agreement to 
provide any medical treatment that the subscriber might need.  The economic risk is thus borne by the doctors."
1549,8," The record contains divergent figures on the percentage of Pima County doctors that belong to the foundation.  A 1975 
publication of the foundation reported 80%; a 1978 affidavit by the executive director of the foundation reported 30%."
1549,9," In 1980, after the District Court and the Court of Appeals had rendered judgment, both foundations apparently discontinued the 
use of relative values and conversion factors in formulating the fee schedules.  Moreover, the Maricopa Foundation that year 
amended its bylaws to provide that the fee schedule would be adopted by majority vote of its board of trustees and not by vote of 
its members.  The challenge to the foundation activities as we have described them in the text, however, is not mooted by these 
changes.  See United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953)."
1549,10," The parties disagree over whether the increases in the fee schedules are the cause or the result of the increases in the 
prevailing rate for medical services in the relevant markets.  There appears to be agreement, however, that 85-95% of 
physicians in Maricopa County bill at or above the maximum reimbursement levels set by the Maricopa Foundation."
1549,11," Seven different insurance companies underwrite health insurance plans that have been approved by the Maricopa 
Foundation, and three companies underwrite the plans approved by the Pima Foundation.  The record contains no firm data on 
the portion of the health care market that is covered by these plans.  The State relies upon a 1974 analysis indicating that the 
insurance plans endorsed by the Maricopa Foundation had about 63% of the prepaid health care market, but the respondents 
contest the accuracy of this analysis. "
1550,12," HN3[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 1."
1550,13," Justice Brandeis provided the classic statement of the rule of reason in Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 
238 (1918): HN4[
] ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint 
was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, 
the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.  This is not 
because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may 
help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."" "
1551,14," For a thoughtful and brief discussion of the costs and benefits of rule-of-reason versus per se rule analysis of price-fixing 
agreements, see F. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 438-443 (1970).  Professor Scherer's 
""opinion, shared by a majority of American economists concerned with antitrust policy, is that in the present legal framework the 
costs of implementing a rule of reason would exceed the benefits derived from considering each restrictive agreement on its 
merits and prohibiting only those which appear unreasonable."" Id., at 440."
1551,15," HN5[
] ""Among the practices which the courts have heretofore deemed to be unlawful in and of themselves are price fixing, 
division of markets, group boycotts, and tying arrangements."" Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S., at 5 (citations 
omitted).  See United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 522-523 (1948)."
1551,16," Thus, in applying the per se rule to invalidate the restrictive practice in United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596 
(1972), we stated that ""[w]hether or not we would decide this case the same way under the rule of reason used by the District 
Court is irrelevant to the issue before us."" Id., at 609. The Court made the same point in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania 
Inc., 433 U.S., at 50, n. 16: ""Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial practices.  The 
probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences must be 
balanced against its procompetitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects 
the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify 
them."" "
1552,17," Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S., at 156 (Harlan, J., dissenting). "
1553,18," It is true that in Kiefer-Stewart, as in Albrecht, the agreement involved a vertical arrangement in which maximum resale prices 
were fixed.  But the case also involved an agreement among competitors to impose the resale price restraint.  In any event, 
horizontal restraints are generally less defensible than vertical restraints.  See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 
U.S. 36 (1977); Easterbrook, Maximum Price Fixing, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886, 890, n. 20 (1981)."
1553,19," The argument should not be confused with the established position that HN10[
] a new per se rule is not justified until the 
judiciary obtains considerable rule-of-reason experience with the particular type of restraint challenged.  See White Motor Co. v. 
United States, 372 U.S. 253 (1963). Nor is our unwillingness to examine the economic justification of this particular application of 
the per se rule against price fixing inconsistent with our reexamination of the general validity of the per se rule rejected in 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra."
1553,20," ""The health care industry, moreover, presents a particularly difficult area.  The first step to understanding is to recognize that 
not only is access to the medical profession very time consuming and expensive both for the applicant and society generally, but 
also that numerous government subventions of the costs of medical care have created both a demand and supply function for 
medical services that is artificially high.  The present supply and demand functions of medical services in no way approximate 
those which would exist in a purely private competitive order.  An accurate description of those functions moreover is not 
available.  Thus, we lack baselines by which could be measured the distance between the present supply and demand functions 
and those which would exist under ideal competitive conditions."" 643 F.2d, at 556. "
1554,21," ""Perforce we must take industry as it exists, absent the challenged feature, as our baseline for measuring anticompetitive 
impact.  The relevant inquiry becomes whether fees paid to doctors under that system would be less than those payable under 
the FMC maximum fee agreement.  Put differently, confronted with an industry widely deviant from a reasonably free competitive 
model, such as agriculture, the proper inquiry is whether the practice enhances the prices charged for the services.  In simplified 
economic terms, the issue is whether the maximum fee arrangement better permits the attainment of the monopolist's goal, viz., 
the matching of marginal cost to marginal revenue, or in fact obstructs that end."" Ibid."
1554,22," In the first price-fixing case arising under the Sherman Act, the Court was required to pass on the sufficiency of the 
defendants' plea that they had established rates that were actually beneficial to consumers. Assuming the factual validity of the 
plea, the Court rejected the defense as a matter of law.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290 (1897). In 
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 689 (1978), we referred to Judge Taft's ""classic 
rejection of the argument that competitors may lawfully agree to sell their goods at the same price as long as the agreed-upon 
price is reasonable."" See United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271 (CA6 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211 (1899). In our 
latest price-fixing case, we reiterated the point: ""It is no excuse that the prices fixed are themselves reasonable."" Catalano, Inc. 
v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647 (1980)."
1554,23," HN11[
] ""Whatever economic justification particular price-fixing agreements may be thought to have, the law does not permit 
an inquiry into their reasonableness.  They are all banned because of their actual or potential threat to the central nervous 
system of the economy."" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 226, n. 59 (1940)."
1554,24," According to the respondents' figures, this presumption is well founded.  See Brief for Respondents 42, n. 120. "
1555,25," We do not perceive the respondents' claim of procompetitive justification for their fee schedules to rest on the premise that the 
fee schedules actually reduce medical fees and accordingly reduce insurance premiums, thereby enhancing competition in the 
health insurance industry.  Such an argument would merely restate the long-rejected position that fixed prices are reasonable if 
they are lower than free competition would yield.  It is arguable, however, that the existence of a fee schedule, whether fixed by 
the doctors or by the insurers, makes it easier -- and to that extent less expensive -- for insurers to calculate the risks that they 
underwrite and to arrive at the appropriate reimbursement on insured claims."
1555,26," According to a Federal Trade Commission staff report: ""Until the mid-1960's, most Blue Shield plans determined in advance 
how much to pay for particular procedures and prepared fee schedules reflecting their determinations.  Fee schedules are still 
used in approximately 25 percent of Blue Shield contracts."" Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Medical 
Participation in Control of Blue Shield and Certain Other Open-Panel Medical Prepayment Plans 128 (1979).  We do not suggest 
that Blue Shield plans are not actually controlled by doctors. Indeed, as the same report discusses at length, the belief that they 
are has given rise to considerable antitrust litigation.  See also D. Kass & P. Pautler, Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade 
Commission, Staff Report on Physician Control of Blue Shield Plans (1979).  Nor does this case present the question whether 
an insurer may, consistent with the Sherman Act, fix the fee schedule and enter into bilateral contracts with individual doctors. 
That question was not reached in Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205 (1979). See id., at 210, n. 
5. In an amicus curiae brief, the United States expressed its opinion that such an arrangement would be legal unless the 
plaintiffs could establish that a conspiracy among providers was at work.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1978, 
No. 77-952, pp. 10-11.  Our point is simply that the record provides no factual basis for the respondents' claim that the doctors 
must fix the fee schedule."
1555,27," In that program the foundation performs the peer review function as well as the administrative function of paying the doctors' 
claims."
1555,28," In order to create an insurance plan under which the doctor would agree to accept as full payment a fee prescribed in a fixed 
schedule, someone must canvass the doctors to determine what maximum prices would be high enough to attract sufficient 
numbers of individual doctors to sign up but low enough to make the insurance plan competitive. In this case that canvassing 
function is performed by the foundation; the foundation then deals with the insurer. It would seem that an insurer could simply 
bypass the foundation by performing the canvassing function and dealing with the doctors itself.  Under the foundation plan, 
each doctor must look at the maximum-fee schedule fixed by his competitors and vote for or against approval of the plan (and, if 
the plan is approved by majority vote, he must continue or revoke his foundation membership).  A similar, if to some extent more 
protracted, process would occur if it were each insurer that offered the maximum-fee schedule to each doctor. "
1556,29," In this case it appears that the fees are set by a group with substantial power in the market for medical services, and that there 
is competition among insurance companies in the sale of medical insurance.  Under these circumstances the insurance 
companies are not likely to have significantly greater bargaining power against a monopoly of doctors than would individual 
consumers of medical services."
1556,30," ""[Congress] can, of course, make per se rules inapplicable in some or all cases, and leave courts free to ramble through the 
wilds of economic theory in order to maintain a flexible approach."" United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S., at 610, n. 
10. Indeed, it has exempted certain industries from the full reach of the Sherman Act. See, e. g., 7 U. S. C. §§ 291, 292 (Capper-
Volstead Act, agricultural cooperatives); 15 U. S. C. §§ 1011-1013 (McCarran-Ferguson Act, insurance); 49 U. S. C. § 5b (Reed-
Bulwinkle Act, rail and motor carrier rate-fixing bureaus); 15 U. S. C. § 1801 (newspaper joint operating agreements)."
1556,31," ""Thus, to the extent the blanket license is a different product, ASCAP is not really a joint sales agency offering the individual 
goods of many sellers, but is a separate seller offering its blanket license, of which the individual compositions are raw material."" 
441 U.S., at 22 (footnote omitted)."
1556,32," ""Here, the blanket-license fee is not set by competition among individual copyright owners, and it is a fee for the use of any of 
the compositions covered by the license. But the blanket license cannot be wholly equated with a simple horizontal arrangement 
among competitors. ASCAP does set the price for its blanket license, but that license is quite different from anything any 
individual owner could issue.  The individual composers and authors have neither agreed not to sell individually in any other 
market nor use the blanket license to mask price fixing in such other markets."" Id., at 23-24 (footnote omitted). "
1557,33," It may be true that by becoming a member of the foundation the individual practitioner obtains a competitive advantage in the 
market for medical services that he could not unilaterally obtain.  That competitive advantage is the ability to attract as 
customers people who value both the guarantee of full health coverage and a choice of doctors. But, as we have indicated, the 
setting of the price by doctors is not a ""necessary consequence"" of an arrangement with an insurer in which the doctor agrees 
not to charge certain insured customers more than a fixed price. "
1558,1," The Pima Foundation is open to any Pima County area physician licensed in Arizona.  It has a renewable 5-year membership 
term.  A voluntary resignation provision permits earlier exit on the January 1 following announcement of an intent to resign. The Maricopa Foundation admits physicians who are members of their county medical society.  The Maricopa Foundation has a 
renewable 1-year term of membership. Initial membership may be for a term of less than a year so that a uniform annual 
termination date for all members can be maintained. The medical societies are professional associations of physicians practicing in the particular county.  The Pima County Medical 
Society, but not the Pima Foundation, has been dismissed from the case pursuant to a consent decree."
1558,2," Three private carriers underwrite various Pima Foundation-sponsored plans: Arizona Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Pacific Mutual 
Life Insurance Co., and Connecticut General Life Insurance Co.  The latter two companies also underwrite plans for the 
Maricopa Foundation, as do five other private insurance companies.  Apparently large employers, such as the State of Arizona 
and Motorola, also act as foundation-approved insurers with respect to their employees' insurance plans."
1558,3," The foundations act as the insurance companies' claims agents on a contract basis.  They administer the claims and, to some 
extent, review the medical necessity and propriety of the treatment for which a claim is entered.  The foundations charge 
insurers a fee for their various services.  In recent years, this fee has been set at 4% of the insurers' premiums."
1558,4," This agreement provides in part that the physician agrees ""to be bound . . . with respect to maximum fees . . . by any fee 
determination by the [foundation] consistent with the schedule adopted by the [foundation physician] membership . . . ."" App. 31-
32.  The agreement also provides that foundation members ""understand and agree that participating membership in the 
[foundation] shall not affect the method of computation or amount of fees billed by me with respect to any medical care for any 
patient."" Ibid. "
1559,5," At least seven insurance companies are competing in the relevant market.  See n. 2, supra.  At this stage of the case we must 
infer that they are competing vigorously and successfully. The term ""consumer"" -- commonly used in antitrust cases and literature -- is used herein to mean persons who need or may 
need medical services from a physician."
1559,6," The State introduced no evidence on its summary judgment motion supporting its apparent view that insurers effectively can 
perform this function themselves, without physician participation.  It is clear, however, that price and quality of professional 
services -- unlike commercial products -- are difficult to compare.  Cf.  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 391-395 
(1977) (opinion of POWELL, J.).  This is particularly true of medical service.  Presumably this is a reason participating insurers 
wish to utilize the foundations' services. "
1560,7," See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S., at 25 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part) (""The 
Court holds that ASCAP's blanket license is not a species of price fixing categorically forbidden by the Sherman Act. I agree with 
that holding"")."
1560,8," Cf. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 54 (1977) (identifying achievement of efficiencies as ""redeeming 
virtue"" in decision sustaining an agreement against per se challenge); L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust § 74, p. 200 (1977) (per se 
characterization inappropriate if price agreement achieves great economies of scale and thereby improves economic 
performance); id., § 66, p. 180 (higher burden might reasonably be placed on plaintiff where agreement may involve 
efficiencies). "
1561,9," In this case the physicians in effect vote on foundation maximum-fee schedules.  In Broadcast Music, the copyright owners 
aggregated their copyrights into a group package, sold rights to the package at a group price, and distributed the proceeds 
among themselves according to an agreed-upon formula.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. American Society of 
Composers, Authors and Publishers, 562 F.2d 130, 135-136 (CA2 1977)."
1561,10," In this case, the foundations' maximum-fee schedules attempt to rectify the inflationary consequence of patients' indifference 
to the size of physicians' bills and insurers' commitment to reimburse whatever ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" charges 
physicians may submit.  In Broadcast Music, the market defect inhered in the fact that ""those who performed copyrighted music 
for profit were so numerous and widespread, and most performances so fleeting, that as a practical matter it was impossible for 
the many individual copyright owners to negotiate with and license the users and to detect unauthorized uses."" 441 U.S., at 4-5."
1561,11," In this case, the record before us indicates that insurers -- those best situated to decide and best motivated to inspire trust in 
their judgment -- believe that the foundations are the most efficient providers of the maximum-fee scheduling service.  In 
Broadcast Music, we found that the blanket copyright clearinghouse system ""[reduced] costs absolutely . . . ."" Id., at 21."
1561,12," The Court states that in Broadcast Music ""there was little competition among individual composers for their separate 
compositions."" Ante, at 355.  This is an irrational ground for distinction.  Competition could have existed, 441 U.S., at 6; see also 
562 F.2d, at 134-135, 138, but did not because of the cooperative agreement.  That competition yet persists among physicians 
is not a sensible reason to invalidate their agreement while refusing similarly to condemn the Broadcast Music agreements that 
were completely effective in eliminating competition. The Court also offers as a distinction that the foundations do not permit the creation of ""any different product."" Ante, at 356.  But 
the foundations provide a ""different product"" to precisely the same extent as did Broadcast Music's clearinghouses.  The 
clearinghouses provided only what copyright holders offered as individual sellers -- the rights to use individual compositions. The 
clearinghouses were able to obtain these same rights more efficiently, however, because they eliminated the need to engage in 
individual bargaining with each individual copyright owner.  See 441 U.S., at 21-22. In the same manner, the foundations set up an innovative means to deliver a basic service -- insured medical care from a wide 
range of physicians of one's choice -- in a more economical manner.  The foundations' maximum-fee schedules replace the 
weak cost containment incentives in typical ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" insurance agreements with a stronger cost 
control mechanism: an absolute ceiling on maximum fees that can be charged.  The conduct of the insurers in this case 
indicates that they believe that the foundation plan as it presently exists is the most efficient means of developing and 
administering such schedules.  At this stage in the litigation, therefore, we must agree that the foundation plan permits the more 
economical delivery of the basic insurance service -- ""to some extent, a different product."" Broadcast Music, 441 U.S., at 22. "
1562,13," Medical services differ from the typical service or commercial product at issue in an antitrust case.  The services of physicians, 
rendered on a patient-by-patient basis, rarely can be compared by the recipient.  A person requiring medical service or advice 
has no ready way of comparing physicians or of ""shopping"" for quality medical service at a lesser price.  Primarily for this 
reason, the foundations -- operating the plan at issue -- perform a function that neither physicians nor prospective patients can 
perform individually.  On a collective -- and average -- basis, the physicians themselves express a willingness to render certain 
identifiable services for not more than specified fees, leaving patients free to choose the physician.  We thus have a case in 
which we derive little guidance from the conventional ""perfect market"" analysis of antitrust law.  I would give greater weight than 
the Court to the uniqueness of medical services, and certainly would not invalidate on a per se basis a plan that may in fact 
perform a uniquely useful service. Affirmance of the District Court's holding would not have immunized the medical service plan at issue.  Nor would it have 
foreclosed an eventual conclusion on remand that the arrangement should be deemed per se invalid.  And if the District Court 
had found that petitioner had failed to establish a per se violation of the Sherman Act, the question would have remained 
whether the plan comports with the rule of reason. See, e. g., United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 441, n. 
16 (1978). "
1570,*," Paul R. Friedman, Bruce J. Ennis, and Donald N. Bersoff filed a brief for the American Psychological Association as amicus 
curiae urging affirmance."
1570,1, With petitioner Blue Shield of Southwestern Virginia. 
1571,2," Petitioners contend that the contract between the county and Blue Shield must be read to bar payments for the services of 
nonphysicians.  Respondent counters that between 1962 and 1972 Blue Shield routinely reimbursed subscribers for 
psychotherapy provided by psychologists, and that this practice was revised in 1972 as a result of the alleged conspiracy. In 
addition, respondent notes that in 1973 the Virginia Legislature passed a ""freedom of choice"" statute, Va. Code § 38.1-824 
(1981), that required Blue Shield to pay for services rendered by licensed psychologists. See Virginia Academy of Clinical 
Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Virginia, 624 F.2d 476, 478 (CA4 1980). She argues that Blue Shield's obligations must be read 
consistently with that statute, at least until that statute was held invalid as applied in Blue Cross of Virginia v. Commonwealth, 
221 Va. 349, 269 S. E. 2d 827 (1980). This case arises on a motion to dismiss.  We therefore assume, as McCready has 
alleged, that but for the alleged conspiracy to deny payment, she would have been reimbursed by Blue Shield for the cost of her 
psychologist's services."
1571,3," Apparently Blue Shield inadvertently paid one of McCready's claims.  After the error was discovered, Blue Shield sought to 
obtain a refund from McCready for the amount paid.  649 F.2d 228, 230, n. 4 (1981)."
1571,4," A similar complaint was filed by the Virginia Academy of Clinical Psychologists (VACP) and its president against the same 
defendants.  The District Court addressed the motions to dismiss filed in each of the cases in a single opinion.  The court 
dismissed McCready's case -- thus giving rise to the appellate decision at issue in this Court -- but permitted the VACP case to 
proceed to trial.  Following trial, the District Court entered judgment for the defendants, Virginia Academy of Clinical 
Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Virginia, 469 F.Supp. 552 (1979), but the Court of Appeals reversed with respect to defendant 
Blue Shield, 624 F.2d 476 (CA4 1980). The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the instant case states that 
the opinion in VACP ""should be read in connection with"" its own opinion.  649 F.2d, at 230. A brief recitation of the decision in 
the VACP case is thus helpful in understanding the precise nature of McCready's claim. In VACP, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's treatment of Blue Shield as a distinct entity for purposes of 
determining whether a conspiracy or agreement had been shown.  624 F.2d, at 479. The court found that ""the Blue Shield Plans 
are combinations of physicians, operating under the direction and control of their physician members."" Ibid. ""Blue Shield Plans are not insurance companies, though they are, to a degree, insurers.  Rather, they are generally 
characterized as prepaid health care plans, quantity purchasers of health care services.  [In] a real and legal sense, the Blue 
Shield Plans are agents of their member physicians."" Id., at 480 (citations and footnote omitted). With respect to the question whether the alleged Blue Shield combination was ""in restraint of trade,"" the Court of Appeals agreed 
with the District Court that the rule of reason was applicable, but held that the District Court had erred in finding no liability.  The 
Court of Appeals observed that psychologists and psychiatrists compete in the psychotherapy market, and that the decisions of 
Blue Shield ""necessarily dictate, to some extent,"" who will be chosen to provide psychotherapy. Id., at 485. Finding that Blue 
Shield's policy of denying reimbursement for the psychotherapeutic services of psychologists unless billed through physicians, 
was not merely a cost-containment device or simply ""good medical practice,"" as claimed by Blue Shield, the court held that Blue 
Shield had violated the Sherman Act.  Ibid. "
1572,5," HN1[
] That section provides, in pertinent part, that ""[every] contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."""
1572,6," That section provides, in pertinent part: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."""
1572,7," Petitioners have argued in this Court that under § 2 of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1012, their actions were 
exempt from the antitrust laws as part of the ""business of insurance."" In ruling on petitioners' motion to dismiss, the District Court 
concluded that respondent had adequately pleaded a boycott beyond the protection of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. 
§ 1013(b).  Respondent points out that on a full factual record the issue was resolved against the petitioners in VACP, 624 F.2d, 
at 483-484. The Court of Appeals did not address this question in the present case, however, and we do not reach it here."
1572,8," Addressing the ""target area"" limitation on antitrust standing recognized in several Courts of Appeals, see n. 14, infra, the court 
concluded that the policies underlying that limitation were not implicated by McCready's claim.  649 F.2d, at 231-232. The 
dissenting judge took a contrary view of the ""target area"" rule.  He emphasized that McCready had not described her injury ""as a 
design or goal of any antitrust violation,"" but ""rather as a consequence thereof."" Id., at 232. He viewed this as the determinative 
factor in the proper application of the ""target area"" test to the facts of this case: ""In determining who has standing to sue, the courts must look at who the illegal act was aimed to injure.  A bystander, who is not 
the intended victim of the antitrust violation but who is injured nonetheless, cannot sue under the antitrust laws. His injury is too 
remote."" Id., at 233. In addition, the dissent argued that McCready was not within the sector of the economy ""competitively endangered"" by the 
alleged violation, agreeing with the District Court that ""she operated in a market which was unrestrained so far as she was 
concerned."" Id., at 234. Finally, the dissent reasoned: ""The price of psychologists' services to her was not increased by any act of the defendants.  The fact that her Blue Shield 
contract . . . would not reimburse her for those services had nothing to do with the price she paid for the services, which . . . were 
not artificially inflated by an antitrust violation. . . . "". . . There is not even a claim that her psychologists' bills are higher than they would have been had the conspiracy not existed."" 
Id., at 235-236. "
1573,9," In a related context we commented that ""[in] the face of [the congressional antitrust] policy this Court should not add 
requirements to burden the private litigant beyond what is specifically set forth by Congress . . . ."" Radovich v. National Football 
League, 352 U.S. 445, 454 (1957). See also Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Co., 364 U.S. 656, 659-660 (1961) (per 
curiam) (To state a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, ""allegations adequate to show a violation and, in a private treble 
damage action, that plaintiff was damaged thereby are all the law requires"")."
1573,10," Permitting McCready to maintain this lawsuit will, of course, further certain basic objectives of the private enforcement scheme 
embodied in § 4.  Only by requiring violators to disgorge the ""fruits of their illegality"" can the deterrent objectives of the antitrust 
laws be fully served.  Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 494 (1968). See Pfizer Inc. v. India, 
434 U.S. 308, 314 (1978); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746 (1977). But in addition to allowing Blue Shield to retain a 
palpable profit as a result of its unlawful plan, denying standing to McCready and the class she represents would also result in 
the denial of compensation for injuries resulting from unlawful conduct. "
1574,11," If there is a subordinate theme to our opinions in Hawaii and Illinois Brick, it is that the feasibility and consequences of 
implementing particular damages theories may, in certain limited circumstances, be considered in determining who is entitled to 
prosecute an action brought under § 4.  Where consistent with the broader remedial purposes of the antitrust laws, we have 
sought to avoid burdening § 4 actions with damages issues giving rise to the need for ""massive evidence and complicated 
theories,"" where the consequence would be to discourage vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws by private suits.  Hanover 
Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., supra, at 493. Thus we recognized that the task of disentangling overlapping 
damages claims is not lightly to be imposed upon potential antitrust litigants, or upon the judicial system.  See Hawaii v. 
Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264 (1972); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, at 741-742. In addition, while ""[difficulty] of 
ascertainment [should not be] confused with right of recovery,"" Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 265 (1946), § 
4 plainly focuses on tangible economic injury.  It may therefore be appropriate to consider whether a claim rests at bottom on 
some abstract conception or speculative measure of harm.  See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, at 262-263, n. 14. But like 
the policy against duplicative recoveries, our cautious approach to speculative, abstract, or impractical damages theories has no 
application to McCready's suit.  The nature of her injury is easily stated: As the result of an unlawful boycott, Blue Shield failed to 
pay the cost she incurred for the services of a psychologist. Her damages were fixed by the plan contract and, as the Court of 
Appeals observed, they could be ""ascertained to the penny."" 649 F.2d, at 231. "
1575,12," We addressed two issues of ""remoteness"" in Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 642 (1969). That case involved an alleged 
violation of § 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 13. Focusing on the substantive 
terms of § 2, we found no warrant in its ""language or purpose"" to engraft an ""artificial"" limitation on the reach of the remedy to 
bar what the court below had termed a ""fourth level"" injury.  395 U.S., at 648. We also rejected the claim that one form of 
damages claimed by the defendant was not the proximate result of the alleged violation.  Id., at 649. The Courts of Appeals have developed a more substantial jurisprudence on the subject of ""remoteness,"" formulating various 
""tests"" as aids in analysis.  Among the tests employed by the lower courts are those that focus on the ""directness"" of the injury, 
e. g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F. 704, 709 (CA3 1910); Productive Inventions, Inc. v. Trico Products Corp., 224 F.2d 
678 (CA2 1955); Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383 (CA6 1962); on its foreseeability, e. g., In re 
Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F.2d 191, 199 (CA9 1973); Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 220 
(CA9 1964); or on whether the injury is ""arguably . . . within the zone of interests protected by the [antitrust laws],"" e. g., 
Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1152 (CA6 1975). See also n. 14, infra (""target area"" test).  The Third Circuit has 
concluded that ""§ 4 standing analysis is essentially a balancing test comprised of many constant and variable factors and that 
there is no talismanic test capable of resolving all § 4 standing problems."" Bravman v. Basset Furniture Industries, Inc., 552 F.2d 
90, 99 (1977). The Third Circuit has thus rejected the definitional approach, opting instead for an analysis of the ""factual matrix"" 
presented by each case.  Ibid.  We have no occasion here to evaluate the relative utility of any of these possibly conflicting 
approaches toward the problem of remote antitrust injury."
1575,13," The traditional principle of proximate cause suggests the use of words such as ""remote,"" ""tenuous,"" ""fortuitous,"" ""incidental,"" or 
""consequential"" to describe those injuries that will find no remedy at law.  See, e. g., South Carolina Council of Milk Producers, 
Inc. v. Newton, 360 F.2d 414, 419 (CA4 1966). And the use of such terms only emphasizes that the principle of proximate cause 
is hardly a rigorous analytic tool.  See, e. g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99 (1928); id., at 351-352, 
162 N. E., at 103 (Andrews, J., dissenting) (""What is a cause in a legal sense, still more what is a proximate cause, depend in 
each case upon many considerations. . . .  What we do mean by the word 'proximate' is, that because of convenience, of public 
policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point"").  It bears 
affirming that in identifying the limits of an explicit statutory remedy, legislative intent is the controlling consideration.  Cf. Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 377-378 (1982); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National 
Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 13 (1981); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15-16 (1979). "
1576,14," In so arguing, petitioners advert to the ""target area"" test of antitrust standing that prevails in the Courts of Appeals for the First, 
Second, and Fifth Circuits.  See, e. g., Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546 (CA5 1980); Engine 
Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 18-19 (CA1 1979); Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre 
Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292 (CA2 1971). Petitioners place special reliance on the following frequently cited formulation of the 
""target area"" principle: ""[In] order to have 'standing' to sue for treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act, a person must be within the 'target area' of 
the alleged antitrust conspiracy, i. e., a person against whom the conspiracy was aimed, such as a competitor of the persons 
sued.  Accordingly we have drawn a line excluding those who have suffered economic damage by virtue of their relationships 
with 'targets' or with participants in an alleged antitrust conspiracy, rather than being 'targets' themselves."" Id., at 1295."
1576,15," Nor does the ""target area"" test applied by the Courts of Appeals ""'imply that it must have been a purpose of the conspirators to 
injure the particular individual claiming damages.'"" See Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America, 637 F.2d 41, 47-48 (CA2 1980), 
quoting Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d, at 220."
1576,16," Petitioners borrow selectively from Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977), in arguing that 
McCready's § 4 claim is ""unrelated to any reduction in competition caused by the alleged boycott,"" because the injury she 
alleges ""is the result of the terms of her insurance contract, and not the result of a reduction in competition."" Brief for Petitioners 
16.  Extracting additional language from Brunswick, they argue that ""McCready would have suffered the identical 'loss' -- but no 
compensable 'injury' as long as her employer, which acted independently in an unrestrained market, continued to purchase a 
group insurance contract that did not cover the services of clinical psychologists."" Brief for Petitioners 16-17 (footnote omitted). "
1577,17," Nor do we think that her employer's decision to retain Blue Shield coverage despite its continued failure to reimburse for the 
services of a psychologist -- or indeed, her employer's unexercised option to terminate that relationship -- is an intervening cause 
of McCready's injury.  Although her employer's decision to purchase the Blue Shield plan for her benefit was in some sense a 
factor that contributed independently to McCready's injury, her coverage under the Blue Shield plan may, at this stage of the 
litigation, properly be accepted as a given, and the proper focus in evaluating her entitlement to raise a § 4 damages claim is on 
Blue Shield's change in the terms of the plan to link reimbursement to a subscriber's choice of one group of psychotherapists 
over another."
1577,18," 649 F.2d, at 236 (Widener, J., dissenting). "
1578,19," Brunswick held that a claim of injury arising from the preservation or enhancement of competition is a claim ""inimical to the 
purposes of [the antitrust] laws,"" 429 U.S., at 488. Most obviously, McCready's claim is quite unlike the claim asserted by the 
plaintiff in Brunswick for she does not seek to label increased competition as a harm to her.  Nevertheless, we agree with 
petitioners that the relationship between the claimed injury and that which is unlawful in the defendant's conduct, as analyzed in 
Brunswick, is one factor to be considered in determining the redressability of a particular form of injury under § 4."
1578,20," Or at the least, Blue Shield sought to compel McCready to employ the services of a physician in addition to those of a 
psychologist."
1578,21," JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting, is of course correct in asserting that the ""injury suffered by the plaintiff must be of the type 
the antitrust laws were intended to forestall,"" post, at 486.  But JUSTICE REHNQUIST's dissent takes an unrealistically narrow 
view of those injuries with which the antitrust laws might be concerned, and offers not the slightest hint -- beyond sheer ipse dixit 
-- to help in determining what kinds of injury are not amenable to § 4 redress. For example, the dissent acknowledges that ""a 
distributor who refused to go along with the retailers' conspiracy [to injure a disfavored retailer] and thereby lost the conspiring 
retailers' business would . . . have an action against those retailers,"" post, at 490.  The dissent characterizes this circumstance 
as a ""concerted refusal to deal,"" and is thus willing to acknowledge the existence of compensable injury.  But the dissent's is not 
the only pattern of concerted refusals to deal.  If a group of psychiatrists conspired to boycott a bank until the bank ceased 
making loans to psychologists, the bank would no doubt be able to recover the injuries suffered as a consequence of the "
1579,," psychiatrists' actions.  And plainly, in evaluating the reasonableness under the antitrust laws of the psychiatrists' conduct, we 
would be concerned with its effects not only on the business of banking, but also on the business of the psychologists against 
whom that secondary boycott was directed. McCready and the banker and the distributor are in many respects similarly situated.  McCready alleges that she has been the 
victim of a concerted refusal by psychiatrists to reimburse through the Blue Shield plan.  Because McCready is a consumer, 
rather than some other type of market participant, the dissent finds itself unwilling to acknowledge that she might have suffered a 
form of injury of significance under the antitrust laws. But under the circumstances of this case, McCready's participation in the 
market for psychotherapeutic services provides precisely that significance. "
1580,1," In addition to the antitrust claim, McCready's complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract under the principles of pendent 
jurisdiction.  App. 57-58.  She also alleges that Blue Shield's policy contravened state law.  Id., at 55-56."
1580,2," The Court explains that those subscribers, such as McCready, who did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressures suffer from 
Blue Shield's sanctions by way of increased costs in obtaining the services of a psychologist. Those subscribers who did yield to 
Blue Shield's pressure suffer antitrust injury indirectly because of suppressed competition in the psychotherapy market.  Ante, at 
483-484.  I do not understand the Court to conclude that Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), would not bar recovery 
by a subscriber, as opposed to a psychologist, in the latter situation."
1580,3," The Court suggests a third theory -- that McCready has standing herself as a target of a concerted refusal to deal.  See ante, at 
484, n. 21; infra, at 490-491."
1580,4," In order to recover under this theory, it would seem that respondent must prove at trial that she actually refused to yield to the 
economic pressure created by Blue Shield's reimbursement policy.  If she decided to obtain the services of a psychologist rather 
than a psychiatrist without knowing of Blue Shield's policy, it cannot be said that her ""injury"" was proximately related to 
petitioners' alleged anticompetitive conduct.  If she discovered the policy only after she sought reimbursement, then it cannot be 
said that Blue Shield's policy had any effect on McCready's conduct as a consumer in the market for psychotherapeutic services.  
This, of course, is not to say that a person in all circumstances must have knowledge of a defendant's anticompetitive activities 
before one may challenge that activity.  One may not be a victim of economic pressure, however, if one acted obliviously to that 
pressure. "
1581,5," By excluding psychologists from the market, psychiatrists may well be able to increase their charges for psychotherapeutic 
services, which in turn, may raise the insurance rates charged by Blue Shield. McCready, however, alleges no such injury to 
herself on this theory."
1581,6," Because McCready obtained the services of a psychologist, it cannot be said that the psychologists were injured by the 
economic pressure Blue Shield placed on McCready and the class of subscribers she represents.  See ante, at 475."
1581,7," As pointed out by the Court, a concerted refusal to deal may take many forms.  Ante, at 484, n. 21.  I would agree that the bank 
could sue in the Court's hypothetical because, as conceded by the Court, the bank's ability to compete with other banks would 
be adversely affected.  By contrast, my disagreement with the Court is that it permits McCready to sue solely because of an 
injury to a level of the market in which she does not participate.  Moreover, McCready does not allege that petitioners' conspiracy 
adversely affected competition between psychologists and psychiatrists in such a manner as to adversely affect the price or 
supply of psychotherapeutic services available to her as a consumer. Thus, McCready's case is clearly distinguishable from that 
of the bank's in the Court's hypothetical. "
1582,8," If McCready's injury were truly ""inextricably intertwined"" with any injury actually suffered by the psychologists, the risk of 
duplicative recovery and the practical problems inherent in distinguishing the loss suffered by her from the loss suffered by the 
psychologists may mean that either subscribers or psychologists, but not both, may recover.  See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 
U.S. 720 (1977)."
1582,1," ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U. S. C. § 15. "
1583,2," In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, we held that antitrust injury was limited to ""'the type of loss that 
the claimed violations . . . would be likely to cause.'"" Id., at 489 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 
100, 125). I would expect that the alleged violation in this case would be most likely to cause knowledgeable members of the 
class of potential consumers of psychotherapeutic services to exercise either the first or the second option.  It is fair to assume 
that the third situation -- the one in which respondent finds herself -- would be ""unlikely"" to result."
1583,3," The subscriber may have to undergo more extensive treatment later if he forgoes treatment now and his illness worsens.  Any 
consequential economic injury, however, would no more constitute antitrust injury than the economic injury suffered by a 
consumer who decides to forgo a purchase on the ground that the price of the goods or services was fixed at an artificially high 
level."
1583,4," If treatment by a psychiatrist and treatment by a psychologist were fungible, then a subscriber who exercised this third option 
effectively would be paying twice for the psychotherapeutic service, once to the insurer in premiums and once to the 
psychologist in an unreimbursable payment.  But the subscriber's exercise of this option presumably indicates that treatment by 
a psychologist is more valuable to him than treatment by a psychiatrist. If that be true, the subscriber is in the same situation as 
any policyholder who desires a service for which he has not purchased insurance."
1583,5," If the subscriber would purchase a service that was covered by the Blue Shield policy, such as a surgical operation, then he 
would be reimbursed by Blue Shield for that payment.  If respondent's antitrust claim is that petitioners have engaged in an 
unlawful boycott, it therefore is manifest that respondent is not the boycottee.  For petitioners have not refused to deal with 
respondent -- they offer her the same coverage as any other subscriber or potential subscriber."
1583,6," Presumably, the charge (if any) of the referring physician would be reimbursable under the policy.  In any event, the complaint 
does not claim damages based on any such unreimbursed charge. "
1590,1," .  Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 provides: HN7[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor … and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's 
fee."
1590,2," .  Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act provides in pertinent part: HN8[
] (a) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality … and where the effect 
of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to 
injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such 
discrimination, or with customers of either of them."
1590,3," .  Following our Memorandum of July 3, 1979, the defendant moved for certification for immediate appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1292(b).  We denied this motion in a Memorandum of August 7, 1979.  We realized at that time that our decision to grant 
standing to plaintiff involved a ""controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion."" 28 
U.S.C. § 1292(b).  We concluded, however, that an immediate appeal would not ""materially advance the ultimate termination of 
the litigation,"" since there were other counts in the complaint, the trial of which would involve substantially the same evidence 
involved in a trial of the antitrust claim.  Therefore, immediate appeal would neither have eliminated the necessity for trial nor 
have significantly simplified or abbreviated trial. "
1591,4," .  Neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has ever held that an employee who has been terminated because of his 
refusal to participate in an antitrust violation (e.g., violation of the Robinson-Patman Act) has suffered an injury ""by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" The Ninth Circuit, however, recently reached the opposite conclusion, holding that such 
an employee could maintain a suit for treble damages. See Ostrofe v. H. S. Crocker Co., Inc., 670 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir. 1982). "
1593,5," .  Nevertheless, plaintiff's tort claim was properly sent to the jury because plaintiff could claim that he was wrongfully discharged 
for refusing to violate the antitrust laws even if he lacked standing to challenge the antitrust violations directly. "
1597,1," .  American stated in its termination letter that Carlson was terminated as of the date of the letter-June 1, 1979.  The letter also 
stated, however, that American would continue to honor orders from Carlson based on outstanding quotations until July 9, 1979.  
Carlson's claim that the termination violated the notice provision of the distribution agreement is discussed in section V, part A of 
this opinion. "
1598,2," .  Carlson also claimed that American engaged in violations of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, but later declared its 
intention to omit this claim from its amended pleadings.  The district court accordingly dismissed the price discrimination count.  
The district court also dismissed Carlson's complaint under section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, charging 
monopolization.  Carlson did not appeal these dismissals."
1598,3," .  The trial court found that no factual dispute existed as to: relevant product and geographic market, the roles of the parties in 
the manufacturing and distribution chain, the use of an exclusive distribution system and suggested retail prices by American, 
the corporate status of American, and the fact that substantial interstate trade or commerce was involved.  The parties do not 
dispute these determinations. "
1601,4," .  For a discussion of why the per se illegality of resale price maintenance as a vertical price restraint should be reconsidered in 
light of Sylvania, see Baker, Interconnected Problems of Doctrine and Economics in the Section One Labyrinth: Is Sylvania a 
Way Out?, 67 Va.L.Rev. 1457, 1463-70 (1981)."
1601,5," .  We recognize, of course, that the Colgate doctrine, although still viable, has been narrowed by the Supreme Court, and 
criticized heavily by antitrust scholars.  See Aladdin Oil Company v. Texaco, Inc., 603 F.2d 1107, 1113-14 (5th Cir. 1979). "
