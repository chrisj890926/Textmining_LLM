25,1," HN1[
] 28 U.S.C. § 1338(b) provides that federal courts have original jurisdiction over claims for unfair competition ""when joined with a substantial and related claim under . . . the trademark laws."" Although originally a codification of the Hurn v. 
Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 77 L. Ed. 1148, 53 S. Ct. 586 (1938) restrictive view of pendent jurisdiction, subsequent decisions have 
updated the statutory interpretation to include the broader Gibbs formulation of pendent jurisdiction. See e.g., Thompson Tool 
Co., Inc. v. Rosenbaum, 443 F. Supp. 559 (D.Conn. 1977). This court assumes that this broader interpretation applies.  In any 
case, plaintiffs fail under the more generous of the two tests and would thus fail under the more restrictive rule."
25,2," A question has arisen over whether the test outlined in the Timberlane decision is in fact one of subject matter jurisdiction. 
Compare In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.2d 1248, 1253-56 and Industrial Investment Development Corporation v. 
Mitsui & Co., Ltd., 671 F.2d 876, 884-85 n. 7 (5th Cir. 1982) with Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corporation, 595 F.2d 
1287, 1297-98 (3d Cir. 1979) (concurring opinion).  Instead of reading Timberlane as establishing a test for subject matter 
jurisdiction, some courts have interpreted the test as a method for determining whether jurisdiction should be asserted, 
assuming the presence of subject matter jurisdiction. See e.g., Industrial Investment Development Corporation v. Mitsui, 671 
F.2d at 884-85 n. 7. This court need not resolve this issue at this time, however, for the result in this case would be the same 
under either interpretation. "
26,3," The Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (Tentative Draft No. 2 1981) suggests these limits: § 403.  Limitation on Jurisdiction to Prescribe (1) Although one of the bases for jurisdiction under § 402 is present, HN4[
] a state may not apply law to the conduct, 
relations, status, or interests of persons or things having connections with another state or states when the exercise of such 
jurisdiction is unreasonable. (2) Whether the exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable is judged by evaluating all the relevant factors, including: (a) the extent to which the activity (i) takes place within the regulating state, or (ii) has substantial direct, and foreseeable 
effect upon or in the regulating state; (b) the links, such as nationality, residence, or economic activity, between the regulating state and the persons principally 
responsible for the activity to be regulated, or between that state and those whom the law or regulation is designed to 
protect; (c) the character of the activity to be regulated, the importance of regulation to the regulating state, the extent to which other 
states regulate such activities, and the degree to which the desirability of such regulation is generally accepted; (d) the existence of justified expectations that might be protected or hurt by the regulation in question; (e) the importance of regulation to the international political, legal or economic system; (f) the extent to which such regulation is consistent with the traditions of the international system; (g) the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity; (h) the likelihood of conflict with regulation by other states. "
27,," (3) HN5[
] An exercise of jurisdiction which is not unreasonable according to the criteria indicated in Subsection (2) may 
nevertheless be unreasonable if it requires a person to take action that would violate a regulation of another state which is 
not unreasonable under those criteria.  Preference between conflicting exercises of jurisdiction is determined by evaluating 
the respective interests of the regulating states in light of the factors listed in Subsection (2). (4) Under the Law of the United States: (a) a statute, regulation or rule is to be construed as exercising jurisdiction and applying law only to the extent permissible 
under § 402 and this section unless such construction is not fairly possible; but (b) where Congress has made clear its purpose to exercise jurisdiction which may be beyond the limits permitted by 
international law, such exercise of jurisdiction, if within the constitutional authority of Congress, is effective as law in the 
United States. Section 402 of the Restatement states the following bases of jurisdiction: Subject to § 403, HN6[
] a state may, under international law, exercise jurisdiction to prescribe and apply its law with 
respect to (1) (a) conduct, a substantial part of which takes place within its territory; (b) the status of persons, or interests in things, present within its territory; (c) conduct outside its territory which has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory; (2) the conduct, status, interests or relations of its nationals outside its territory; or (3) certain conduct outside its territory by persons not its nationals which is directed against the security of the state or a 
certain state interest. "

35,1," At the conclusion of plaintiff's presentation of evidence at the hearing the court ordered that the trial on the merits be 
consolidated with the hearing on the preliminary injunction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a) (2) and issued its findings of fact 
pursuant to Rule 41(b). Thereafter, AIChE timely demanded a jury trial and made objection to the consolidation.  The court 
vacated its oral order to the extent it purported to consolidate the trial on the merits with the hearing on the preliminary injunction."
35,2," AIChE initially filed its appeal from the order of Judge Pierce denying AIChE's motion for a preliminary injunction. After Judge 
Pierce issued his decision granting summary judgment AIChE withdrew the prior appeal by stipulation without prejudice to 
obtaining review of the order denying the injunction on this appeal. "
36,3," Reber-Friel's responsibilities are spelled out in paragraph 2 of the agreement as follows: (a) To rent exhibit space to proper exhibitors and to plan and manage facilities at exposition hall for conferences and 
exhibits. (b) To develop for the Institute a mailing list of prospective exhibitors. (c) To assist the Institute in formulating policy and preparing floor plans and rules and regulations for the expositions. (d) To develop material for the sale or leasing of exhibit space and to assign such space. (e) To lease exhibit space for the Institute, to invoice exhibit space fees for the Institute on the Institute's Expositions 
stationery and to collect such fees for the Institute. (f) To act as general contractor in providing services for exhibitors. (g) To assist in the Institute's programs for the development of an audience. (h) To assist, under the direction of the Institute, at the exposition hall with the physical facilities for registration activities. 
However, all registration facilities shall be paid for by the Institute except those expenses necessary for registering 
exhibitors which shall be borne by Reber-Friel. (i) To supervise physical arrangements for meeting at the exposition hall and manage the installation, operation and 
removal of exhibits. All Meeting facilities shall be paid for by the Institute. (j) To supervise the entire exposition for the term of the lease of the exposition hall. (k) To be responsible for and pay all costs and expense incurred by Reber-Friel in connection with the following -- the rental 
of booth equipment, exhibitors' service bulletins, the preparation of addressing plates and addressing of material to 
potential exhibitors and publicity outlets, the printing and disposition of promotional material, the rental of exhibit space to 
exhibitors, all travel, telephone and correspondence in connection with the rental of exhibit space to exhibitors, publicity, 
booth expenses, sales expenses, staff travel, stationery and contingencies. "
37,4," Services provided by Reber to exhibitors include such items as freight handling, carpentry service, rental of equipment and 
decorating services. Some of the work was delegated by Reber-Friel to subcontractors.  Under its agreement with AIChE, 
Reber-Friel was required to act as general contractor in providing services for exhibitors (see footnote 3 supra.)"
37,5, In this diversity action New York law governs in accordance with the agreement of the parties. 
38,6," Restrictive covenants historically have been frowned upon as is evidenced by the discussion in Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P.Wms. 
181, 24 Eng.  Rep. 347 (Q.B.1711) where ""the court pointed out that the presumption of invalidity stems from the 'mischief' which 
the restraints may cause, first, in the possible loss of the covenantor's means of earning a livelihood and, second, in the loss to 
society of the services of a useful member."" Blake, Employee Agreements Not to Compete, 73 Harv. L.Rev. 625, 629 (1960). The court noted its particular concern with such covenants in employment agreements because of the possibility of ""great 
abuses . . . from masters, who are apt to give their apprentices much vexation on this account, and to use many indirect 
practices to procure such bonds from them, lest they should prejudice them in their custom, when they come up to set up for 
themselves."" 1 P.Wms. at 190, 24 Eng. Rep. at 350. The court, however, recognized the need for such covenants not to compete in the transfer of a business in order to make the 
business saleable. New York courts also recognize the validity of such covenants. In Purchasing Assocs., Inc. v. Weitz, supra, 
13 N.Y.2d at 271, 246 N.Y.S.2d at 603, 196 N.E.2d 245, it was stated: HN3[
] Where, for instance, there is a sale of a business, involving as it does the transfer of its good will as a going 
concern, the courts will enforce an incidental covenant by the seller not to compete with the buyer after the sale. . . . This 
rule is grounded, most reasonably, on the premise that a buyer of a business should be permitted to restrict his seller's 
freedom of trade so as to prevent the latter from recapturing and utilizing, by his competition, the good will of the very 
business which he transferred for value. "
39,7," Notably, in August 1981 AIChE received from Reber-Friel the complete file on each past exhibitor containing correspondence 
and contracts. At the hearing on the preliminary injunction in late September AIChE did not make it clear whether it had referred 
at all to those files for information but it did not assert that there was any relevant information in those files that was not available 
through AIChE brochures and directories distributed to the public."
39,8," For instance, in Molina v. Barany, 56 N.Y.S.2d 124 (Sup. Ct. N.Y.Co. 1945), the bad faith of the defendant was taken into 
consideration. And in Service Systems Corp. v. Harris, 41 A.D.2d 20, 341 N.Y.S.2d 702 (4th Dep't. 1973), the defendant not only "
40,," demonstrated bad faith but the court found his knowledge of trade secrets to be a factor. As stated in Clark Paper & Mfg. Co. v. 
Stenacher, 236 N.Y. 312, 321, 140 N.E. 708, 712 (1923): HN9[
] ""Any unfair competition or practice may move equity to 
enforce a negative covenant."""
40,9," Neither were Reber-Friel's services special, unique or extraordinary so as to justify a restrictive covenant. In Purchasing 
Assocs., Inc. v. Weitz, supra, 13 N.Y.2d at 274, 246 N.Y.S.2d at 605, 196 N.E.2d 245, the court stated: HN11[
] More must, of course, be shown to establish such a quality than that the employee excels at his work or that his 
performance is of high value to his employer. It must also appear that his services are of such character as to make his 
replacement impossible or that the loss of such services would cause the employer irreparable injury. "
41,," Clearly, Reber-Friel's services cannot be so described. Indeed, AIChE did not consider Reber-Friel irreplaceable and in fact had 
a replacement in place at the time of termination of Reber-Friel. As noted by the New York Court of Appeals in American 
Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Wolf, supra, 52 N.Y.2d at 403 n.6, 438 N.Y.S.2d at 486, 420 N.E.2d 363, ""no New York case 
has been found where enforcement [of a restrictive covenant] has been granted, following termination of the employment 
contract, solely on the basis of the uniqueness of the services."" "
42,10," In its request for information AIChE proceeded on the assumption that it is entitled to all material held by Reber-Friel relating to 
AIChE's shows, irrespective of form or content. We note that this case differs from that involving an employer/employee 
relationship, where the employer is entitled to claim as his own that which is produced by the employee during working hours. In 
the case before us the duties of Reber-Friel for which it was being paid are clearly defined by the contract between Reber-Friel 
and AIChE. (See footnote 3, supra). While AIChE may have a right to information that was necessarily procured in performance 
of those duties, it is questionable whether it is entitled to information, forms and systems developed by Reber-Friel at its own 
expense for its own convenience to reduce its expenses. "
43,1," Relevant statistical data supporting these assertions appear in Administrative Office of the United States Courts, 1981 Annual 
Report of the Director at 1, 3, 4, A-2, A-12."
43,2," Of course, plaintiff took this risk by deliberately choosing the federal forum, despite the ease with which plaintiff could have 
obtained an authoritative, conclusive determination in the state courts. "
44,1," Because each case must be judged on its facts, New York courts are reluctant to grant summary judgment even when the 
covenant not to compete is in an employment contract.  Wise v. Transco, Inc., 73 A.D.2d 1039, 425 N.Y.S.2d 434 (1980). "
47,2," The majority asserts that some of the records withheld may have been developed by Reber in the course of its independent 
service work for exhibitors. Reber has never claimed that AIChE sought such documents, and I am unable to find any evidence 
in the record supporting this assertion. "

54,1," 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 1011-1015.  The Act provides in relevant part: "
55,," HN1[
] ""(a) The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States 
which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business. ""(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance, . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance. . . ."" § 2, 15 U. S. C. 
§§ 1012(a), (b). HN2[
] ""(b) Nothing contained in this Act shall render the . . . Sherman Act in applicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" § 3, 15 U. S. C. § 1013(b)."
55,2," The Committee's advice is also available to patients, governmental agencies, and chiropractors themselves, but insurers are 
the principal users.  650 F.2d 387, 388 (CA2 1981)."
55,3," 15 U. S. C. § 1, which provides in pertinent part that ""[every] contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."" "
56,4," The court then turned to the Act's second requirement, that the challenged practices be ""regulated by state law."" The court held 
that that requirement had been met, as well, observing that New York had ""enacted a pervasive scheme of regulation and 
supervision of insurance,"" had prohibited ""the unfair settlement of claims,"" and had proscribed ""the conduct alleged in the 
complaint"" in its state antitrust law, the Donnelly Act, which by its terms applied to insurers. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 81-389, 
pp. 31a-32a.  Finally, the court determined that respondent had neither alleged a ""boycott"" on petitioners' part, nor offered 
evidentiary support for such a claim.  Id., at 33a-35a.  The court thus concluded that the Act's third requirement was satisfied in 
the present case, and that petitioners' actions were consequently ""exempt from application of the antitrust laws."" Id., at 36a."
56,5," Since it reached this conclusion, the Court of Appeals did not definitively address the other holdings of the District Court.  See 
n. 4, supra. The court did note, however, that petitioner NYSCA did not itself ""appear to be regulated by state law in the manner 
§ 2(b) requires."" 650 F.2d, at 390, n. 5."
56,6," As noted by the Court of Appeals, id., at 395, n. 13, the decision below is contrary to that of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth 
Circuit ""in a factually identical case."" See Bartholomew v. Virginia Chiropractors Assn., 612 F.2d 812 (1979). "
57,7," As the Court explained: ""'It is characteristic of insurance that a number of risks are accepted, some of which involve losses, and that such losses are 
spread over all the risks so as to enable the insurer to accept each risk at a slight fraction of the possible liability upon it.' 1 G. 
Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law § 1:3 (2d ed. 1959).  See also R. Keeton, Insurance Law § 1.2(a) (1971) ('Insurance is an 
arrangement for transferring and distributing risk'); 1 G. Richards, The Law of Insurance § 2 (W. Freedman 5th ed. 1952)."" 440 
U.S., at 211 (footnote omitted). "
60,8," The premise of the dissent is that NYSCA's Peer Review Committee actually constitutes ""the claims adjustor"" in these cases.  
See post, at 137.  From this premise the dissent reasons that since ""claims adjustment is part and parcel of the 'business of 
insurance' protected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act,"" post, at 138, it necessarily follows that the peer review practices at issue in 
these cases must enjoy the Act's exemption. The fatal flaw in this syllogism is that NYSCA's Peer Review Committee is not the 
claims adjustor.  As the Court of Appeals noted: ""Opinions of the committee are not binding unless the parties agree beforehand 
that they will be."" 650 F.2d, at 388. Thus in a case such as the present ones, ULL is perfectly free to disregard the Committee's 
evaluation.  Even if ULL were to act upon the Committee's opinion, the nonbinding nature of the Committee's evaluation means 
that, at most, peer review is merely ancillary to the claims adjustment process.  We see no reason that such ancillary activities 
must necessarily enjoy the McCarran-Ferguson exemption from the antitrust laws. Unlike activities that occur wholly within the 
insurance industry -- such as the claims adjustment process itself -- the ancillary peer review practices at issue in these cases 
""involve parties wholly outside the insurance industry."" See Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S., at 231. 
Thus peer review falls afoul of the third Royal Drug criterion in a way in which pure claims adjustment activities cannot."
60,9," This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to address the questions whether the conduct challenged in respondent's 
complaint was ""regulated by state law"" or constituted a ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" See n. 5, supra. "
61,1," Since the Court declines to reach the question of whether petitioners' Committee is regulated by state law as required by the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act, I likewise do not discuss it.  I note, however, that the District Court found petitioners' Committee to be 
so regulated. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 81-389, pp. 31a-32a. "
62,2," Other commentators agree with this assessment of the importance of claims settlement: ""The adjustment (including payment) of claims represents the final act in the insurance process.  The payment of a claim by an 
insurance company brings the insurance contract 'to life' in a fashion far more vivid than does any other single act in connection 
with the purchase, issuance, and maintenance of the contract."" Butler, Loss Adjustment in Fire Insurance, in Property and 
Liability Insurance Handbook 219 (J. Long & D. Gregg eds. 1965). ""Claim administration is the last link in the process of insurance -- a process that begins with actuarial analysis and continues 
through sales, underwriting, investment, and policy service. . . .  [The] expectation of the policyowner that an insurer is willing to 
meet its obligations, through claims administration, is an important part in the decision to purchase insurance.  Indeed, it is the 
claim administration function that delivers on the product sold to the policyowner."" C. Cissley, Claim Administration: Principles 
and Practices iii (1980)."
62,3," Apparently unable to discern the difference between a mere method of paying a claim and the more fundamental process of 
determining whether a claim is covered by the insurance agreement, the Court finds that petitioners' peer review procedure 
""resembles the Pharmacy Agreements in Royal Drug."" Ante, at 131.  But the Pharmacy Agreement at issue in Royal Drug was 
simply a method of reimbursing policyowners for medication expenses.  The policyowners could obtain medication from 
participating pharmacies simply by paying the amount that otherwise would not be covered by the insurance plan.  The 
pharmacies thus constituted nothing more than in-kind dispensers of insurance payments; they played no role whatsoever in the 
more fundamental process of assessing the validity of a claim and determining the amount to be paid.  Peer review committees, 
which fulfill such a fundamental role, are thus quite unlike the arrangements considered by the Court in Royal Drug. "

77,7," .  Thus, a basic antitrust hornbook states: Justice White asked few instrumental questions (in Standard Oil v. United States); his inquiry was sharply focused on whether 
power over price existed and was being exercised.  It did not matter to him that the share of the crude market controlled by the 
combination was exceedingly small, since it appeared that power over crude prices was exceedingly large.  Today, with 
elaborate theoretical tools for analyzing power, courts have developed a set of instrumental issues.  They ask not the ultimate 
question, does the firm have power?, but a series of subsidiary ones like, what market does the firm engage in?, what is its 
share of that market?, are there entry barriers?, and the like.  These instrumental inquiries are of true worth only in such degree 
as they throw light on the ultimate issue.  Sometimes, however, they get in the way.  They are allowed to block off appropriate 
responses toward which a more direct concern with power, such as that shown in Standard Oil, would lead. …. Market definition is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, or an issue having its own significance under the statute; it is merely an aid 
for determining whether power exists …. Sullivan, Antitrust at 38, 41 (1977). "
78,8," .  In Spectrofuge, 575 F.2d at 286, we held that: (T)here was insufficient evidence to support the jury's implicit finding that Beckman monopolized or attempted to monopolize a 
market comprised of the servicing of Beckman's scientific instruments or the submarket comprised of servicing its ultra-
centrifuges.  There was simply no evidence from which the jury could begin to measure Beckman's power to control prices or to 
exclude competition in the relevant market defined by Specterfuge."
78,9," .  The minutes from the industrial council gave the following information on CPC's market shares: Starch Market share goal: 25% Present market share: 21% (September 1971) Historical market share: 27% Corn syrup Market share goal: 17-18% Present market share: 16% At trial, Eiszner testified that in 1970 CPC's share of the market for mill-grade cornstarch was between 21 and 25 percent and 
that the figure for 1971 was in the same range, but he believed it was lower than in 1970.  Eiszner estimated that in 1972 CPC's 
share of the mill-grade cornstarch market was ""back up to about 25%."" With respect to syrup, Eiszner testified that according to 
his best estimates CPC's market share was between 161/2 and 17 percent in 1970, between 151/2 and 161/2 percent in 1971, 
and ""around 14%"" in 1972.  Finally, Eiszner testified that since 1971 CPC's share of the national corn syrup market had dropped 
and had never reached 18 percent. After review of the trial record, we agree with appellant's statements that CPC's maximum possible market shares in the 
narrowest markets alleged by Dimmitt, consistent with the evidence, were: 25% in the national cornstarch market and 17% in the 
national corn syrup market."

U.S. 981, 99 S. Ct. 1789, 60 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1979), where the plaintiff alleged that defendant had a monopoly over the South 
Florida greyhound racing industry.  The defendant controlled 25% of this market, ""since it shares the South Florida dog track 
market with three other tracks which are, generally speaking, allocated an equal number of racing days per year."" Id. at 1246. As 
in this case, the plaintiff argued that ""market share is not the determinative factor in assaying the existence of monopoly power"" 
and that ""the sterile percentage of market approach should not be applied to the South Florida greyhound racing industry."" Id.  
Plaintiff noted that: "
79,," Although each track may have only 25 percent of the market, the fact that only one track is operating at any given time makes 
each track's power significantly greater than that of a firm whose sales represent 25 percent of the normal market.  According to 
plaintiff, the economies of this industry are such that a dog owner must be able to race year round in order to be competitive.  
Ignoring the Broward County track for the moment, plaintiff contends that each track has absolute monopoly power during the 
three months of the year when it is the only track in operation.  Thus, each track can dictate the terms of booking contracts. Id.  In the end, we had no need to resolve the issue presented, since the plaintiff ""did not present any evidence that (defendant) 
used its power to enhance or maintain its position."" Id. at 1247."

electronic equipment and interior furnishings for an extremely differentiated product-a Grumman Gulfstream II (""G-II"") airplane.  
On the question of monopoly power, we stated: Defendants argue that they could not be found guilty of monopolizing as a matter of law, since their market power was 
insufficient to support such a charge….  To be sure, Page's market power did not rise to the level existing in some cases that 
find actual monopolization. However, when Page's market share is viewed alongside the evidence of the number of actual 
competitors, the high barriers to entry, the limited number of G-II's remaining at the time of the trial to be produced, and Page's 
power over price, we believe the court below correctly submitted the issue to the jury. "
81,624," F.2d at 1356-57 (citations omitted).  The sale of even a single additional aircraft could have significantly varied Page's 
market share. As the Sixth Circuit concluded in Borden, Inc. v. FTC, 674 F.2d 498, 512 (6th Cir. 1982): When a seller possesses an overwhelmingly dominant share of the market, however, and differentiates its product from others 
through a recognized and extensively advertised brand name, thereby enabling the seller to control prices or unreasonably 
restrict competition, then monopoly power may be found to exist.  Here Dimmitt did not dispute that fungible, undifferentiated 
products were involved."
81,13," .  Thus, Areeda and Turner conclude: (1) The monopolization offense depends upon proof that substantial market power was (a) possessed by the defendant at the 
time of his exclusionary conduct, (b) achieved as a result of such conduct, or (c) threatened to be achieved by that conduct…. (2) We reject the arguments that the monopolization offense can be established for firms without such power solely on the basis 
of undesirable, or even of significantly anticompetitive, behavior.  In particular, (a) power within a reasonably defined market is 
required, and (b) any refined effort to base the monopolization finding on an inverse ""sliding scale"" that varies the power 
component of the monopolization offense with the ""invidiousness"" of the conduct is doomed to failure.  Yet, more gross versions 
of a sliding scale approach are inevitably involved in dealing with conduct on the road to monopoly ? and conduct that threatens 
but does not achieve monopoly power…. Areeda & Turner, III Antitrust Law P 810 at 296 (1978) (hereinafter cited as Areeda & Turner III)."
81,14," .  The authors' list of instances in which conduct might be taken as sufficient proof of power includes tying arrangements, such 
as in United States v. Loew's, 371 U.S. 38, 83 S. Ct. 97, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1962); Northern Pacific R.R. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958), and practices illegal per se, such as horizontal price-fixing and market-sharing 
arrangements, as in United States v. Socony-Vaccuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224 n.59, 60 S. Ct. 811, 844 n.59, 84 L. Ed. 1129 
(1940). "
82,15," .  Dimmitt's graph suggests that CPC's list prices for corn syrup, for example, were the first down and the last up, belying CPC's 
claim that it was merely following competitors' price decreases."
82,16," .  Thus, Hoyt's market data, supra slip op. at 3268-3269, at  --  drafted when CPC was not the sole defendant, notes that ""the 
corn wet milling industry is highly concentrated with five firms accounting for over 71% of industry capacity"" and that low product 
prices were ""caused by the predatory pricing practices of the Defendants."" (emphasis added).  The jury, however, found 
Dimmitt's evidence insufficient to prove either a price-fixing conspiracy under section 1, Sherman Act, or a conspiracy to 
monopolize under section 2."
82,17," .  Appellee does not claim error in the jury instructions.  The jury's charge on § 2 reads, in pertinent part: The relevant time period means the period of time from December 1970 through January 1973 in which the Dimmitt corn wet 
milling plant was operated by plaintiffs.  Evidence concerning occurrences before and after that period may be considered 
insofar as it bears on occurrences during the relevant time period. …. Specific intent to monopolize means the specific intent of defendant to control prices or to exclude competition in a relevant 
market. The following instructions pertain to specific antitrust violations alleged by plaintiffs. II, III, AND IV MONOPOLIZATION, ATTEMPT TO MONOPOLIZE, AND CONSPIRACY TO MONOPOLIZE Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States … shall be deemed (to have violated the law) …. "
83,," Three separate offenses are included within Section 2 of the Sherman Act: (1) monopolization; (2) attempt to monopolize; and 
(3) combination or conspiracy to monopolize. You are to consider separately the facts with regard to each alleged offense. Monopolization and attempted monopolization are violations which are committed by a single person acting independently rather 
than through joint action with some other person.  A conspiracy to monopolize requires joint action by two or more persons. In considering whether defendant has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, you must first determine the relevant market, that 
is, the line of commerce which defendant has allegedly monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or conspired to monopolize. The 
relevant market consists of two parts: the geographic market and the product market.  In other words, in order to identify a 
relevant market, you must consider the questions of what products are involved and where those products are sold. The relevant geographic market is the United States. The relevant product market is that market in which there is effective competition in the sale and distribution of particular 
commodities and persons actually do, or potentially may, compete in the conduct of their business operations.  The market 
includes other products which may be substitutes for the product in question, if any such substitutes exist and if they are actually 
competitive with the products within the market. The plaintiffs claim that there is a separate relevant product market consisting of the production and sale of cornstarch. 
Defendant contends that other products, such as tapioca starch and wheat starch, compete with corn starch and should be 
included within the same relevant product market.  Plaintiffs also claim that there is a relevant product market consisting of the 
production and sale of corn syrup. Defendant contends that other products, such as dextrose, levulose (high fructose corn 
syrup), and sugar are substitutes for corn syrup, at least for certain customers. Therefore, the Court instructs you that if plaintiffs fail to prove the existence of at least one of their claimed relevant product 
markets, then you may not find that defendant monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or conspired to monopolize trade in 
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. II MONOPOLIZATION Plaintiffs claim that defendant CPC has monopolized the relevant markets of corn starch and corn syrup in the United States, in 
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The term ""monopolize"" means either to obtain or to maintain the power to control prices or exclude competition from a relevant 
market. To find monopolization, it must appear that during the relevant time period: (1) defendant possessed the power to stabilize or control prices or exclude competition; (2) defendant knowingly and wilfully obtained, or maintained, the power to control prices or exclude competition from the relevant 
market of corn starch or corn syrup, or both; and (3) defendant had the intent to exercise that power at that time. Monopolization may be found to exist whenever it appears from a preponderance of the evidence that the three essential facts 
or conditions just stated have in fact occurred.  It is not necessary that competitors actually be removed or excluded from the 
field before monopolization can be found. III ATTEMPT TO MONOPOLIZE Plaintiffs claim that defendant CPC has attempted to monopolize the relevant markets of corn starch and corn syrup in the 
United States, in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The term ""attempt to monopolize"" involves two essential elements: (1) a specific intent to monopolize, and (2) some predatory or 
anticompetitive act done in furtherance of that intent, even though insufficient actually to produce the intended monopolization. In 
order to find an attempt to monopolize, both elements-the intent and the act-must appear, and must together result in a 
dangerous probability that monopolization will sooner or later occur. "
84,, (emphasis in original).
84,18," .  Relative to market share requisites for the completed monopolization offense, minimum market shares for the attempt offense 
are much more unsettled.  We have already cautioned courts to be wary of the ""numbers game of market percentage"" when 
considering attempts.  Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., 417 F.2d 203, 207 n.2 (5th Cir. 1969). Compare Areeda & Turner 
III, P 835 at 350 (advancing some tentative, possibly ""illusory"" rules of thumb on minimum market shares for the attempt 
offense). Neither is the requisite of proof of dangerous probability of monopolization as secure as it once was.  The Ninth Circuit has 
departed altogether from the rule, relying entirely on proof of specific intent to monopolize. See, e.g., Forro Precision, Inc. v. IBM 
Corp., supra. Areeda & Turner would adopt a ""limited per se"" rule for attempt in cases involving ""per se"" illegal conduct, e.g., 
fraudulent procurements of invalid patents (as in Walker Process Equipment v. Food Machines & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 
86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965)) and predatory pricing. Areeda & Turner III, P 836 at 352-55. "
85,19," .  It is, of course, well established that price cutting as a tool to eliminate competition may violate § 2.  See, e.g., Corn Products.  
And even CPC admits in its appellate brief that the memoranda evidence presented by Dimmitt ""if accepted at face value, might 
be relevant to show an intent to monopolize in an attempt case under section 2 …."""
85,20," .  Note that we are not saying that all monopolization offenses must necessarily involve an attempt offense.  They may well be 
cases in which a plaintiff succeeds in demonstrating a general intent to monopolize for the completed monopolization claim but 
fails to prove overt acts demonstrative of specific intent sufficient to carry an attempt claim.  This case, however, is not one of 
those."
85,21," .  We reserve for another day one question raised by the litigants-whether proof of market power is unnecessary when the 
antitrust plaintiff demonstrates predatory pricing. There are authorities that would regard this as analogous to a ""per se"" attempt 
offense.  See, e.g., Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. Ct. 
103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978) (proof of predatory conduct can in some circumstances permit inferences of specific intent and 
dangerous probability of success); Areeda & Turner III, P 836(b) at 352-55.  At trial Dimmitt attempted to prove that CPC 
dumped its cornstarch and corn syrup prices below both its total and average variable costs for sustained periods.  The issue of 
whether the plaintiff here demonstrated predatory pricing by CPC, joined with the troubling question of whether there are 
categories of conduct-such as predatory pricing-that constitute unlawful § 2 attempts with little or no proof of defendant's market 
power may be the subject of a second appeal in this case.  They are questions that, at the outset, should be resolved by the trial 
court on remand.  We find, with some relief, that they are at present not ripe for our review. "

115,3," In the case of In re Mid-Atlantic Togota Antitrust Litigation, MDL Docket No. 456Y, a case involving some similar issues as now 
before this Court (Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia are all involved), the trial court 
ruled that: ""Clearly, Congress contemplated that the only action necessary for a state to take with regard to this statute was to opt out if it 
so wished."" This case is now before the Fourth Circuit.  It has not yet been argued. "
116,4, The issues raised are set out in full; see pp. 1 and 2 of this order. 
117,5," In a reply memorandum, the defendant Scott & Fetzer advances the contention that because thirteen states have enacted 
parens patriae enabling legislation even though they have similar powers as the Iowa Attorney General does under 13.2(2), that 
Iowa should recognize the problem as the other states have and either join the crowd and enact such enabling legislation or stay 
out of these cases.  However, as the plaintiff points out, eleven of those thirteen states enacted statutes to provide standing in 
their own state antitrust statute in state court and not pursuant to the federal antitrust statutes in federal court. Only two of the thirteen states enacted statutes which contain a grant of standing to their attorney general to file such a case in 
both state and federal court.  The Connecticut statute has since been held to have been preempted by this later enaced federal 
statute. This leaves only one state -- West Virginia -- that felt it necessary to enact legislation purporting to specifically authorize their 
attorney general to file federal parens patriae suits.  Whatever the West Virginia legislature's reasons were, they are not 
controlling here. "

128,6," .  It is with reluctance that the court has quoted so extensively from this case, but to have deleted a portion of the quotation 
would have resulted in failing to set forth a full explanation of the ruling in the case at bar. "
130,7," .  That legal standard, however, must be applied with a practical understanding of business realities.  Even legitimate price 
decreases will necessarily have a non-remunerative effect upon other firms in the market.  These decreases will reduce 
competitors' profit margins and they may drive the inefficient firm out of business while the firm which originally reduced prices 
continues to make a profit.  It is the very nature of competition that the vigorous, efficient firm will drive out less efficient firms.  
This is not proscribed by the antitrust laws. ""Antitrust legislation is concerned primarily with the health of the competitive process, 
not with the individual competitor who must sink or swim in competitive enterprise."" ….  Thus we must exercise great care in 
differentiating between legitimate price competition and that ""predatory pricing"" which constitutes a restraint of trade. Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855-56 (9th Cir. 1977); see also A. H. Cox & Co., v. Star Machinery 
Co., 653 F.2d 1302, 1307 (9th Cir. 1981). "
132,8," .  Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, authorizing private antitrust suits for damages, provides in part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor …. This statute confers standing to sue only upon those persons causally injured by antitrust violations….  Moreover, in order to 
prevail the plaintiff must prove not only injury causally linked to the asserted violation, but also that the injury is the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent….  The plaintiff's burden of proving the former is satisfied by proof of some damage 
flowing from the antitrust violation….  Satisfying the latter burden is dependent on a showing that the injury was caused by a 
reduction, rather than an increase, in competition flowing from the defendant's acts, since ""(t)he antitrust laws … were enacted 
for ""the protection of competition not competitors,' "" …  Accordingly, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's conduct 
was intended to or did have some anticompetitive effect beyond his own loss of business or the market's loss of a competitor….  
Moreover, it is not sufficient for an antitrust plaintiff to allege an indirect ripple effect.  As this court wrote in John Lenore & Co. (v. 
Olympia Brewing Co., 550 F.2d 495 (1977) ): It is not enough to confer standing that plaintiff just prove some injury and show that this injury is within the affected area of the 
economy.  Antitrust violations admittedly create many foreseeable ripples of injury to individuals, but the law has not allowed all 
of these merely affected by the ripples to sue for treble damages."

The court went on to state, at p. 735-36: There are three essential elements to a successful claim of Sec. 2 monopolization: a) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market; b) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power; and c) causal ""antitrust"" injury. There are four elements to a successful claim of Sec. 2 attempt to monopolize: a) specific intent to control prices or destroy competition with respect to a part of commerce; b) predatory or anticompetitive conduct directed to accomplishing the unlawful purpose; c) a dangerous probability of success; and d) causal ""antitrust"" injury.

142,3," On February 27, 1981, this Court limited the temporal scope of this case to defendants' conduct between the April, 1975, jury 
verdict in the 1971 case and April, 1978, when Sealy changed the composition of its board of directors.  See Ohio-Sealy 
Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Kaplan, 90 F.R.D. 40 (N.D. Ill. 1981). Plaintiffs are also seeking relief for alleged unlawful 
conduct after April, 1978, in Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Duncan, 548 F. Supp. 75 (N.D. Ill. 1982), for 
additional alleged wrongs in Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Haas, No. 82 C 2488 (N.D. Ill.). "
143,4, Magistrate Cooley reached the same conclusion for similar reasons. 
145,5," Certain passages in those opinions gave the impression that all of Ohio's claims with respect to the Reading and Des Moines 
acquisitions were barred on res judicata grounds.  See, e.g., Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Kaplan, 90 F.R.D. 
11, 20 (N.D. Ill. 1980); Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Kaplan, 90 F.R.D. 21, 24, n. 4 (N.D. Ill. 1980)."
145,6," We also note that to the extent that defendants' position concerning Ohio's standing to challenge the Reading and Des Moines 
acquisitions raises a question with respect to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, Association of Data Processing Service 
Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970), it may not be waived but may be asserted at

issue is not properly before the Court.  Its ""outline,"" however, is fairly detailed, complete with argument and case citations.  
Accordingly, the Court does not deem additional briefing to be necessary to a resolution of defendants' motion on the merits. "

148,15," It is generally recognized that HN8[
] standing to seek injunctive relief for a violation of the antitrust laws pursuant to section"
148,16," of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, is more easily obtained than is standing to seek treble damages under section 4 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, 596 F.2d 573, 590-94 (3d Cir. 1979); Universal 
Brands, Inc. v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 546 F.2d 30, 34 (5th Cir. 1977). In order to seek injunctive relief under section 16, a plaintiff 
need only demonstrate that it is threatened with injury attributable to defendant's alleged anticompetitive conduct.  Id. Inasmuch 
as we conclude below that Ohio-Sealy does not have standing to seek relief under section 1 of the Sherman Act or Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act, we need not reach the ""vexed question"" of whether the divestiture sought by Ohio-Sealy would be available to a 
private litigant under section 16 as an equitable remedy for a violation of the antitrust laws. Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Company, 457 F. Supp. 404, 428 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)."
148,16," Indeed, the Detroit licensee, Sealy Mattress Company of Michigan, Inc., subsequently filed suit in its own right against Sealy 
alleging a violation of the antitrust laws as a result of the Des Moines acquisition. See Sealy Mattress Company of Michigan, Inc. 
v. Sealy, Inc., No. 80 C 4676 (N.D. Ill.).  Ohio-Sealy has not joined in that suit. "
149,17," It is interesting to note that, during the trial of the 1971 case, Ohio-Sealy proved that the mattress business was essentially 
local in nature, thereby further undercutting its argument, advanced herein, that its presence in the industry as a whole entitles it 
to complain of a diminution in competition in a local market in which it does not compete.  As the court of appeals stated in Ohio-
Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Company v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 821, 828 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 930, 59 L. Ed. 
2d 486, 99 S. Ct. 1267 (1979): ""Ohio proved that the mattress business is substantially local in nature, because of the bulk and weight of the product, the 
fact that retailers typically do not care to warehouse the product and the need for frequent customer sales calls.  As Sealy 
concedes, the great majority of mattress sales are made within 200-300 miles of a manufacturing plant."" "
151,18," Even if we were to hold that plaintiffs had not waived their right to arbitration of the royalty question, we would not order 
arbitration in this case at the present time.  As set forth more fully below, the antitrust issues in this aspect of the case so 
permeate the contract questions that remand to an arbiter would be inappropriate in any event until the Court settles the antitrust 
questions involved.  Applied Digital Technology, Inc. v. Continental Casualty Company, 576 F.2d 116 (7th Cir. 1978)."
151,19," Ohio-Sealy also argues that Sealy has used the royalty increases over the years to subsidize this litigation and that such 
subsidization constitutes a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
152,20," Ohio-Sealy's attempted defensive use of section 8 would also probably be barred by the policy expressed in Bruce's Juices 
and Kelly, supra, since enforcement of the royalty increases would not result directly in a violation of section 8.  The violation 
would be complete once the allegedly illegally constituted board sat as a body."
152,21," Article VII of the license agreement requires payment of royalties on a licensee's net sales of ""Sealy Products."" ""Sealy 
Products"" are defined in article I.A. of the license agreement as products bearing the Sealy mark or those that ""are produced, 
with Sealy's approval, in Licensee's plant at a location enumerated in Section II."" "

variety testing at U & I.  The combined results of replicated variety tests done by U & I showed that, from 1972 to 1976, 
Betaseed's HH22 had a significantly lower percentage of sugar than did U & I's 8.  The sugar percentage of Betaseed's HH7 
was lower than U & I 8 for the years 1972 and 1974 and this was a statistically significant difference in 1972 and 1974.  In 1975, 
however, HH7's sugar percentage was higher than that of U & I 8.  In 1976, HH7 was again lower in terms of sugar percentage 
but this was not statistically significant.  He concluded that U & I's 8 higher percentage of sugar was statistically significant as to 
HH22 but not as to HH7.  Late in 1974 or early in 1975, he informed the U & I management of his opinion.  He again so informed 
them in late 1975 or early 1976.  Nielsen Affidavit, CR 60 PP 5, 9, 12. It is important to note that Nielsen did not compare U & I 3 to HH7 and HH22.  This is significant because the contract required 
non U & I seed to produce beets having characteristics substantially similar to those produced from U & I 3 and 8, yet Nielsen's 
tests only compared Betaseed's varieties to U & I 8."

HH22; (2) U & I 8 has a small top easily removed while HH22 has a rough crown and has a harder top; (3) they are comparable 
in terms of pounds of sugar per acre; (4) U & I 8 has higher curly top resistance than HH22; (5) U & I ""will always make sure that 
sufficient U & I hybrid seed is available for all growers,"" while ""it has been indicated that HH22 is in short supply;"" and (6) ""Hybrid 
8 appears to be more resistent to Erwinia rot than HH22."" Deposition Exhibit P-602."
165,12," .  The profit to be gained from sugar beet sales is estimated at $ 1,192,190.00.  The report states: Improved sugar beet varieties have a positive effect on the profitability of other aspects of the sugar beet industry in addition to 
the profit returned from the sale of seed. Sugar beet varieties with increased sucrose percentage and improved purity are more 
economically processed in the mill.  Sugar beet varieties with increased yield of sucrose per acre and improved disease 
resistance maintain or improve the competitiveness of sugar beets compared to other crops. Deposition Exhibit P-607 (emphasis added). A letter dated March 7, 1973, from Nielsen, indicates that Betaseed's hybrids and U & I hybrids do not differ significantly in terms 
of gross sugar per acre. Deposition Exhibit P-507.  In the replication variety tests pooled for 1973, 1974 and 1975, however, 
HH22 was significantly higher than U & I in yield of sucrose tons per acre. Deposition Exhibit P-607. The table listing the economics of different sugar beet varieties to the sugar beet industry contains a conclusion that HH22 would 
result in a $ 1,121,400.00 loss per year while U & I 8 would net a $ 240,600.00 profit per year.  Deposition Exhibit P-607 Results of 1973 Idaho strip tests attached to the report list HH22 and HH7 as lower than U & I 8 and U & I 3 in terms of gross 
sugar and percent sucrose. They yield more tons per acre than U & I 3 but fewer tons per acre than U & I 8.  In the Idaho-
Aberdeen variety tests, HH7 and HH22 were higher than U & I 8 and U & I 3 in terms of sucrose yield (tons/acre) and beet yield 
(tons/acre), but lower in terms of percent sucrose. In commercial tests pooled for Washington locations for 1975, HH22 had a higher yield of sucrose and tons per acre but a lower 
percentage sucrose than did U & I.  The lower percentage sucrose was determined to be significant.  HH7 was significantly 
higher than U & I 8 in terms of yield of sucrose (tons/acre) and tons per acre but significantly lower than U & I 8 in terms of

Company has since installed the latest equipment available to correct this problem.  These changes have resulted in production 
of exceptionally debris free seed. Last year the Company, in the spirit and interest of progress, started using a coloring agent on its seed to facilitate the location of 
the seed in the ground.  This materially aids in the determination of planting depth and seed spacing.  The coloring agent was 
applied to the seed at rates that were too high with subsequent flaked off of the coloring material and accumulation of the 
material in the bottom of the seed hoppers.  (sic) In some instances this caused growers to empty and clean the seed hoppers 
more frequently than they may have felt desirable.  To correct this undue flaking of coloring agent for seed processed in 1976, 
the amount added was reduced and application of heat was used to fix the color to the seed. In addition, the seed was screened immediately prior to bagging to remove any remaining coloring agent … Deposition Exhibit P-507."

in all four of the tests and HH7 was lower in three of the four tests.  In all four tests, HH22 had a higher amount of pounds of 
extractable sugar per acre, pounds of gross sugar per acre, and tons of beets per acre than did U & I 8. For two tests, U & I 8 had a higher score than HH7 in terms of extractable sugar per acre, pounds of gross sugar per acre and 
tons of beets per acre. In two tests, HH7 scored higher than U & I 8 in these categories except pounds of extractable sugar per 
ton. In the Othello, Washington test, HH7 had a higher percentage of sucrose than did U & I 8, but HH22's sucrose was lower than U

the gist of the whole problem, that it just isn't possible for the sugar beet farmer to grow beets under the proposed scale that the 
company is offering."" After this statement was made, ""(t)here was some discussion that the company can't control the kind of 
seed the growers plant."" It is reported that: Charlie Whipple (then) said that it was too bad but the Antitrust laws in the United States put them in a very bad position with 
keeping other types of seed out of the Washington area.  Mark said the company can't legally get into a position where they are 
limiting those who can sell seed in the State of Washington. Id. The growers informed U & I that the payment scale's pivot point, which started at 16.091, was ""just too high when (in) only (one) 
year in the last five has the sugar content been over 16%."" The subject of the scale was then dropped from negotiation.  
Deposition Exhibit P-130. The WSBGA officer recording the minutes of another negotiations meeting described the payment scale bargaining as follows: (The) clause in the contract is good and that there is no reason to change it … as a provision is made for other types of seed. 
(sic) (The company discussed the clause) and the change in the payment scale whereby ""low sugar would take a beating and some 
adjustment in high sugar beets;"" …  Pete (a U & I manager) took the position that the language in the contract is ok.  Russ 
wanted to know what justification the company had for a change in scale and Ford said the company is prepared to make some 
changes trading high sugar for low.  More discussion took place on the low sugar content this year where only company seed 
was used. Wallentine said that the situation as far as the seed clause is concerned leaves the company open to litigation …  Ford Scully 
discussed the work that is being done in the seed laboratory to breed new seed for high sugar and tonnage and that the 
company felt it was not good when outside sources come into the state to sell an inferior seed. Whipple took the position that a 
change in the scale was a good approach … "
169,," They were not prepared to supply any figures on any scale change proposal but wanted to discuss it.  They still took the position 
that they must be able to select varieties of seed planted.  Pete advised the company that we were opposed to any change in 
the scale.  He and others got back on the low sugar content (of beets) this year (with use of only U & I seed).  Joe pointed out 
that the costs involved as far as growers were concerned were just the same whether you grew a high or a low sugar beet … The seed problem last year was kicked around.  Nothing gained. Also the problem of planting U & I seed on germination, 
emergence, and what have you…. Whipple got back on the deal that the company didn't know the legal ramifications of the problem but that seed competition was 
getting to be a real problem…. Russ suggested that we take the seed clause out of the contract and Mark countered by saying that freight is quite an item of 
cost….  Russ said that the growers are a captive group because we have one company where we can deliver beets and also the 
fact that the company apparently didn't have any concern for the growers' costs during early harvest…. The question was asked whether the company would pay more for early harvest (or) low (sugar) content beet and the group was 
told they wouldn't. Deposition Exhibit 125 (emphasis added)."

126 (1975) (De Voto I) this court reversed summary judgment on a section one claim because there was evidence that 
defendants' breach of contract may have been based on factors other than traditional business considerations-that is, a 
corporate relationship or a business decision based on favoring corporate affiliations-and hence, presented an issue of fact as to 
whether defendants unreasonably intended to restrain trade.  In reaching this conclusion, this court relied on two cases involving 
reciprocity issues: FTC v. Consolidated Foods Corp., 380 U.S. 592, 85 S. Ct. 1220, 14 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1965) and International Salt 
Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S. Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20 (1947). Consolidated Foods involved a successful § 7 Clayton Act "
172,," challenge to a merger on the grounds that it created a potential for reciprocity. International Salt involved a successful § 1 
Sherman Act challenge to a lease agreement for industrial salt machinery that required lessees to also purchase from the lessor 
all salt used in the machines.  The Supreme Court did not expressly refer to the practice as reciprocity or tying-in; however, the 
practice could be so characterized.  De Voto I discussed both cases for the proposition that the use of a corporate relationship to 
induce another to breach a contract is an irrelevant and alien factor that may produce an anticompetitive effect.  516 F.2d at 6. After trial on remand, the parties appealed.  At the outset, we indicated that the evidence would be reviewed according to the 
rule of reason rather than a per se analysis because there were not sufficient grounds to conclude that business decisions based 
on favoring corporate affiliations automatically must be condemned.  De Voto v. Pacific Fidelity Life Insurance Co., 618 F.2d 
1340, 1344 (9th Cir. 1980) (De Voto II).  Unlike De Voto, the coercive dealing arrangement at bar may fit the category of a per se 
tie-in, e.g., Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 386 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed.

reciprocal dealings.  The trial judge distinguished between coercive and noncoercive reciprocity, submitting to the jury only the 
issue of coercive reciprocity on a per se basis.  The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.  On appeal, Columbia asserted that 
it should have been allowed to have a jury determination on the issue of noncoercive reciprocity. The Court of Appeals assumed 
that noncoercive reciprocity could violate the Sherman Act, but held that, as a matter of law, if parties of equal economic strength 
mutually participate in the formulation and execution of the scheme and bear equal responsibility, each is barred from antitrust

sales was involved, there could be no recovery. In Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969) (Fortner I), the

whether a total amount of business, substantial enough in terms of dollar-volume so as not to be merely de minimus, is 
foreclosed by the tie …  Id. at 501, 89 S. Ct. at 1257. There, $ 90,000 satisfied the test. "

therefore did possess sufficient economic power in the tying product market to restrain competition in the tied market.

Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d at 1215. Thus, the second element of the per se test is met.  The third requirement, that not 
an insubstantial amount of commerce in the tied product market be affected, means that it cannot be de minimus.  Moore v. Jas. 
H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d at 1216. U & I does not dispute that the amount of commerce attributed to Betaseed in 1976 and "
176,," its almost 20 percent market share of total volume of sales, approximately $ 300,000, is enough to meet the third element of the 
test under Moore.  See id.  Similarly, U & I does not challenge that Betaseed suffered injury as a result of U & I's tie-in and thus 
the fourth element is not an issue."
176,35," .  In Moore, we rejected the argument that the fact that each purchaser of a cemetery lot was not absolutely required to buy a 
cemetery lot marker meant that coercion had not been shown.  We stated that a HN11[
] showing of an onerous effect on an 
appreciable number of buyers coupled with a demonstration of sufficient economic power in the tying market is sufficient to 
demonstrate coercion. 550 F.2d at 1217. Thus, coercion in the context of a tie-in means that a product sold on the condition that 
the buyer also purchase a different or tied product or at least that the buyer agrees not to purchase the product from any other 
supplier.  Northern Pacific Railroad Co., 356 U.S. at 5-6 & n.4, 78 S. Ct. at 518 & n.4. ""Where such conditions are successfully 
exacted competition on the merits with respect to the tied product is inevitably curbed."" Id. at 6, 78 S. Ct. at 518. Consequently, 
tie-ins are ""unreasonable in and of themselves whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product 
to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product and a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce 
is affected (citations)."" Id.  Where the seller has no control or dominance over the tying product so that it cannot be an ""effectual 
weapon to pressure buyers into taking the tied item"" the restraint attributable to it ""would obviously be insignificant at most."" Id. Northern Pacific demonstrates these principles.  There, the Court stated that the undisputed facts established beyond any 
genuine question that the defendant possessed substantial economic power by virtue of its extensive landholdings.  The 
defendant used this power as leverage to induce large numbers of purchasers and lessees to give it preference, to the exclusion 
of its competitors, in transporting goods or produce from the land defendant transferred to them.  In disposing of its holdings the 
defendant had entered into contracts of sale or lease covering several millions of acres of lands.  The ""very existence"" of these 
contracts, which contained "" ""preferential routing' clauses"" was ""itself compelling evidence of the defendant's great power, at 
least where, as (there), no other explanation had been offered for the existence of these restraints"".  Id. at 7-8, 78 S. Ct. at 519 
(footnote omitted).  The preferential clauses, the court explained, did not confer any benefit on the purchasers or lessees-""they 
got the land they wanted by yielding their freedom to deal with competing carriers, …"" Id. at 8, 78 S. Ct. at 519. The defendant's 
purpose, in the Court's view, ""obviously was to fence out competitors, to stifle competition."" Id.  The Court noted that while it may 
have been beneficial to defendant's business, it was ""the very type of thing (that) the Sherman Act condemns."" Id. The Court 
concluded that the arrangement was a per se tie-in. In reaching this conclusion, the Court discussed its earlier decision in International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S. 
Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20 (1947). There the defendant refused to lease its salt dispensing machines unless the lessee also agreed to 
purchase from the defendant all the salt it used in the leased machines.  The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of 
plaintiff because it was "" ""unreasonable, per se, to foreclose competitors from any substantial market' by tying arrangements…. 
""By contracting to close this market for sale against competition, International (Salt) ha(d) engaged in a restraint of trade for "
177,," which its patents afford(ed) no immunity from the antitrust laws.' "" Northern Pacific Railroad Co., 356 U.S. at 9, 78 S. Ct. at 520 
(quoting International Salt, 332 U.S. at 396, 68 S. Ct. at 15). The Northern Pacific Railroad Court again discussed International Salt in rejecting defendant's argument that its preferential 
routing clauses did not significantly restrain competition because they permitted the vendee or lessee to ship by a competing 
carrier if its rates were lower or if its services were better than defendants.  The Court first observed that if, as defendant had 
contended, these restrictive provisions were harmless with no tendency to restrict competition, ""it is hard to understand why 
(defendant) has expended so much effort in obtaining them in vast numbers and upholding their validity, or how they are of any 
benefit to anyone, even the defendant."" Id. at 12, 78 S. Ct. at 521.  The Court reasoned that ""however that may be,"" the 
essential fact remained that the agreements were binding obligations ""held over the heads of vendees"" which denied 
competitors access to the ""fenced-off market on the same terms as the defendant."" Id.  The Court then referred to a similar 
argument proffered by the defendants and rejected by the Court in International Salt.  The defendant there argued the restraint 
was not offensive because it allowed lessees to buy salt from other suppliers when they offered a lower price than that of 
defendant. The Northern Pacific Railroad quoted from International Salt: "" ""(That exception) does, of course, afford a measure of protection to the lessee, but it does not avoid the stifling effect of the 
agreement on competition.  The appellant had at all times a priority on the business at equal prices.  A competitor would have to 
undercut appellant's price to have any hope of capturing the market, while appellant could hold that market by merely meeting 
competition.  We do not think that this concession relieves the contract of being a restraint of trade, albeit a less harsh one than 
would result in the absence of such a provision.  332 U.S. at 397 (68 S. Ct. at 15)."""

the company advised the WSBGA that Betaseed must prove that its seed is as good as U & I seed several WSBGA members 
reportedly took issue with U & I: (They) stated that the seed that was put out prior to a couple of years ago was a bunch of crap with a lot of dirt and foreign 
material so that it was difficult to handle through a regular drill bit and that the company didn't do anything about cleaning up 
their seed until Betaseed came into the picture. (Then there was) some discussion of the Great Western seed and the fact that it doesn't have the curly top resistance other 
seeds have.  Mark advised the company they can't legally shut out other kinds of seeds…. Mark again got back on the idea that the company must have a solution to the seed problem … and that they must get the scale 
back in shape to meet the economic problem they are confronted with…. Again more discussion in favor of Betaseed in 1975 and before as being cleaner and a better seed to plant…. Questions were asked why the company's # 8 seed had more bolters and what this did to the sugar content.  There didn't seem 
to be any answers. Deposition Exhibit P-130 (emphasis added). At another meeting, after Charles Whipple from U & I reportedly said that ""seed competition was getting to be a real problem,"" 
WSBGA members ""discussed the problem that they had up until about a year or two ago with the company seed being so dirty 
… and that the only time the company cleaned up the seed was after they had competition from other seed companies."" U & I "
178,," then brought up Betaseed and said it was their burden to show whether its seed is as good as U & I.  ""Russ suggested we take 
the seed clause out of the contract … (and) that the growers are a captive group because we have but one company where we 
can deliver beets."" Deposition Exhibit P-125. "
180,37," .  The text of a talk given by Kent Nielsen from U & I indicates that the seed characteristics important to a grower are those that 
yield the highest possible production of sugar per acre. Growers are paid on both yield and sucrose content which makes high 
production of sugar per acre ""of foremost importance"" to growers. The genetically controlled factors which insure this in a crop 
are rapid high emergence, frost resistance, and good seedling vigor. The sugar processor, according to Nielsen, ""is concerned 
with purity and extractable sucrose, or sugar content."" ""A sugar factory is for one purpose and that is to manufacture sugar. This 
can best be done when the beets have few impurities and a high percentage of sucrose content."" Deposition Exhibit P-507. "
181,," From a grower's standpoint, Betaseed asserts, the test data indicate that Betaseed seed, which in U & I's view gives greater 
yield and gross sugar at the expense of extractable sucrose content, is better.  U & I counters that its ""seed"" is superior to 
Betaseed from the point of view of both a processor and a grower. The minutes of a U & I-WSBGA contract meeting indicate that growers thought Betaseed was cleaner and a ""better seed to 
plant."" Deposition Exhibit P-130."

sufficient to preserve and even extend its market share by excluding or preventing competition: ""A variety of techniques may be 
employed to achieve this end-predatory pricing, lease-only policies, and exclusive buying arrangements, to list a few."" The court also noted that the mere possession of monopoly power does not ipso facto condemn a market participant; but to 
avoid ""the proscriptions of § 2, the firm must refrain at all times from conduct directed at smothering competition."" Id. at 275. A

207,*," Honorable Sherrill Halbert, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of California, sitting by designation. "
208,1," The distinguishing feature of an endowment care cemetery is that part of the purchase price of each cemetery lot is placed into 
a permanent trust to be used for the perpetual management and maintenance of the cemetery and any grave markers erected 
there. See Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 97.810 [1] and [7]."
208,2," Briefly summarized, HN1[
] tying involves a seller's use of a dominant position in one product market to enhance its position 
in a separate product market by tying products from the two markets together for sale as a single unit at a single price.  Northern 
Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958). Tying offends antitrust values because it 
denies competitors free access to the tied product market as well as limiting buyers' choices in the tied product market. This 
occurs not because the seller imposing the arrangement is offering a superior product, but solely due to the leverage exerted by 
the tying product.  Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43, 47 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955, 92 S. Ct. 1172, 31 
L. Ed. 2d 232, 172 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 577 (1972). "
209,3," United States v. Imperial Irrigation District, 559 F.2d 509, 520 (9th Cir. 1977), modified on other grounds, 595 F.2d 524, 
reversed in part, vacated in part, both on other grounds, sub nom.  Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 65 L. Ed. 2d 184, 100 S. Ct. 
2232 (1980). "
210,4," HN4[
] Three criteria must be satisfied to demonstrate an illegal tying arrangement: First, there must in fact be a tying arrangement between two distinct products or services. Second, the defendant must 
have sufficient economic power in the tying market to impose significant restrictions in the tied product market. Third, the 
amount of commerce in the tied product must not be insubstantial. Moore II, 550 F.2d at 1212 (citations omitted). The second and third criteria -- neither of which was a basis for the district court's 
rejection of the installation tying claim -- merit brief consideration. Neither factor supports the cemeteries' contentions or warrants 
a remand. The second criteria -- HN5[
] market power in the tying product -- may be shown by product uniqueness or desirability, a 
requirement we found satisfied in Moore II. 550 F.2d at 1215. On remand, the district court also found that the cemeteries 
possessed the requisite degree of market power in the tying market of grave lots. Although this finding was made in regard to 
the sales tying claim, it is equally applicable to the installation claim, and is supported by substantial evidence. HN6[
] To satisfy the third criteria -- proof of an effect on interstate commerce in the tied market -- the challenged restraint 
must implicate more than a de minimis amount of interstate commerce in the tied product or service.  Moore II, 550 F.2d at 1216. 
Although neither Moore II nor the district court's decision can be construed as having directly decided the issue, our review of the 
record indicates that it would be unfair to all concerned to remand the tying claims a third time on this issue. The effect-on-
commerce criteria was clearly satisfied in regard to the sales tie. The cemeteries sold over 2 million dollars worth of markers 
between 1965 and 1978, virtually all of which originated from outside Oregon.  Although admittedly a closer question, the record 
also demonstrates that sufficient lumber, nails, concrete, and other construction materials originating from outside Oregon were 
used in the hundreds of marker installations at issue in this case to satisfy the criteria as a matter of law. "
212,5," Although EGM sold only about 4% of the markers placed in the defendant cemeteries, the company sold and installed 
approximately 50% of the markers placed in those Lane County cemeteries that lacked restrictive practices. The cemeteries 
vigorously argued that the other cemeteries, none of which were endowment care cemeteries like the defendants, were 
inaccurate comparables. The defendants offered no explanation, however, for why EGM's sales increased to almost 50% at 
each of the three settling endowment care cemeteries following their discontinuation of the challenged exclusivity requirements."
212,6," We note that the calculation of installation damages can be made from the evidence already in the record. Because EGM's 
damage evidence was offered before the district court ruled on the tying claims, it necessarily included damages attributable to 
both ties. Indeed, proceeding on the assumption that both the sales and the installation restraints had been held illegal in Moore 
II, Dr. Reinmuth originally made no attempt to compute separately the damages from the two ties. It was not until after the district 
court upheld the installation tie and agreed to reopen proceedings to hear additional evidence on damages that Dr. Reinmuth 
separated the two charges. This was done, as the district court requested, using the information already in evidence. "
213,7," The district court denied the cemeteries' motion to reopen the amended decision in regard to damages and attorney fees. The 
judge observed that the ""award of damages that I would have made except for that mandate from the Court of Appeals [Moore II] 
would have been zero,"" and that ""one reason the attorney's fees was low is that the amount of the [damage] award is too high."""
213,8," This court will not disturb a district court's award of attorney fees absent an abuse of discretion. See e.g., O'Neil v. City of Lake 
Oswego, 642 F.2d 367, 370 (9th Cir. 1980); Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 69 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied sub 
nom., 425 U.S. 951, 96 S. Ct. 1726, 48 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1976). "
214,9," Given that this case has generated three appeals, the staggering number of claimed attorney hours is not, on its face, out of 
line with claims made in other complex antitrust cases. See generally Comment, Attorneys' Fees in Individual and Class Action 
Antitrust Litigation, 60 Cal.L.Rev. 1656, 1679-82 (1972) (Appendix -- Table of fee awards in antitrust cases)."
214,10," Our review of the voluminous record discloses no evidence to support the district court's finding that only half of the work by 
EGM's attorneys was sufficiently ""useful"" to warrant reimbursement. Much of the work that we might otherwise consider 
marginally useful was a necessary response to the numerous motions and defenses made by the cemeteries."
214,11," HN12[
] Time spent on appeal may be included in a fee award under section 4 of the Clayton Act.  Perkins v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 474 F.2d 549, 553 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 940, 37 L. Ed. 2d 400, 93 S. Ct. 2778 (1973); Knutson v. 
Daily Review, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 1263, 1273 (N.D. Cal. 1979). "
215,12," For example, consideration of the ""difficulty of the questions"" should be subsumed under ""time and labor required,"" while 
factors concerning the level of skill required for the services, the fixed or contingent nature of the fee, time limitations, the 
amount to be obtained, the reputation of counsel, and the undesirability of the case, are all elements to be considered in setting 
the customary hourly fee.  Copeland v. Marshall, 641 F.2d at 890."
215,13," Kerr's laundry-list of factors ""offers no guidance on the relative importance of each factor, whether they are to be applied 
differently in different contexts, or indeed, how they are to be applied at all."" Berger, supra, at 286-87."
215,14," See, e.g., Copeland v. Marshall, 641 F.2d at 890-94; Furtado v. Bishop, 635 F.2d 915, 919-20 (1st Cir. 1980); Detroit v. 
Grinnell Corp., 560 F.2d 1093 (2d Cir. 1977); Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114, 128-29 (8th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 423 U.S. 864, 46 L. Ed. 2d 93, 96 S. Ct. 124 (1975)."
215,15," But see Brandenburger v. Thompson, 494 F.2d 885, 890 n.7 (9th Cir. 1974), a pre-Kerr decision, in which we remanded a civil 
rights action for an award of attorney fees in light of Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., supra, Kerr's Fifth Circuit 
predecessor, and Lindy I, the Third Circuit's origination of lodestar analysis."
215,16," The ""contingency considerations"" referred to in the above quote are three-fold: "
216,1," . Analysis of plaintiff's burden -- considering the legal and factual complexity of the case, the probability of defendant's 
liability, whether damages would be difficult or easy to prove;"
216,2," . Risks assumed in developing the case -- number of hours and out-of-pocket expenses risked without guaranteed 
compensation; and"
216,3," . Delay in receipt of payment for services rendered. Knutson, 479 F.2d at 1277, paraphrasing Lindy, 540 F.2d at 117. The second contingency consideration -- the risks assumed -- 
is similar to the sixth Kerr guideline, requiring inquiry into the fixed or contingent nature of the fee. Particularily in cases not 
involving a potential for substantial monetary recovery, an enhanced fee due to its contingent nature may be justified. Awards 
should not automatically be increased, however, merely because there are risks associated with contingent fee arrangements.  
In fee-generating cases where a large damage recovery is likely, the contingent fee arrangement, by its very nature, helps 
compensate the attorneys for the risks involved. This can be especially true in antitrust cases where treble damages are 
available. The fee, based on a percentage of the total recovery, may be generous, yet the plaintiff in such situations may recover 
even more than actual damages after paying such fee.  Further, the deterrent effect on the defendant should adequately be 
accomplished by assessing treble damages plus a normal attorney's fee without enhancement for its contingency under those 
circumstances. "
219,1," See Consent Decree Bills: Hearings on H.R. 9203, H.R. 9947, and S. 782 before the Subcommittee on Monopolies and

Chairman Rodino)."
219,2, 119 Cong. Rec. 3451 (1973) (introductory remarks of Sen. Tunney).
219,3," HN3[
] It is appropriate to consider the legislative history in construing the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h).  This is not a statute that can be interpreted on its ""plain meaning."" Compare Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 6 n.4, 
65 L. Ed. 2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502 (1980). The language of the statute refers to ""consent judgments,"" an unusual variation on the 
more common term ""consent decree."" "
220,4," The government also points out that application of the APPA to require the government to prosecute a case it does not wish to 
pursue may cause a lack of a case or controversy to sustain the court's jurisdiction.  The court need not reach this issue, and 
does not decide it. "
223,1," Section 9.2 provides in relevant part: So long as (i) Developer shall not be in default under this section 9, (ii) Occupants of at least 200,000 square feet of Floor 
Area of the Mall Stores shall be conducting business, and (iii) Occupants of at least two of the other Major Stores are 
conducting business, each Major Occupant shall: (x) for a period of 20 years after the Opening Date continuously operate 
its Store . . . as a first class department store occupying at least two-thirds of the Floor Area specified in section 3 under a 
name including ""Penney"", ""Ward"" or ""Lansburgh's"", as the case may be, unless the name of all of such Major Occupant's 
stores in the Washington Metropolitan Area is changed, in which event the Store of such Major Occupant may be operated 
under the name as changed; and (y) thereafter, for an additional period of 10 years, continuously operate or cause to be so 
operated its Store . . . as a first class department store . . . . EOA § 9.2.  The EOAA substituted ""Korvette's"" for the term ""Lansburgh's"" in section 9.2.  See EOAA § 4(A) (2)."
223,2," Section 9.4 states: Notwithstanding anyghing to the contrary herein contained, each Major Occupant may: (i) lease portions of its Store or license departments therein or grant concessions to Subtenants for the sale of merchandise 
or services therein; provided, however, that Subtenants in the Store of any Major Occupant shall not occupy in the 
aggregate more than 20% of the Floor Area in such Store; . . . . See EOA § 9.4.  The EOAA did not modify section 9.4(i). "
224,3," Both the affirmative and negative components of the COP meet the three requirements for running with the land.  Most state 
courts do not draw a distinction between affirmative and negative covenants in determining whether they run with the land.  See 
20 Am. Jur. Covenants § 37 (1965). In a few states, however, an affirmative covenant cannot attach to the land.  See id. The 
Virginia courts have not spoken to this issue.  Even if Virginia were to join the minority, the negative portion of the COP would 
still run with the land.  Thus, the COP, at a minimum, would preclude Net from subdividing its store or using it for any purpose 
other than the operation of a first class department store. If Virginia were to follow the majority rule, the plaintiff also would have 
an affirmative duty to operate a Korvette's store."
224,4," In a typical covenant running with the land, the burden component binds both the original covenantor and the person who 
currently owns the burdened parcel. See 20 Am. Jur. Covenants § 25 (1965).  The original covenantor may escape his 
obligations only by obtaining a release from all interested parties. The benefit component, however, attaches strictly to the 
benefitted parcel. See id. § 21.  The current owner alone has the right to enforce the benefit component.  See id. The EOA 
follows this pattern closely.  See EOA §§ 18.1, 18.2, 29.3, 29.15."
224,5," ASC has never obtained a release from its obligations under the COP.  It, therefore, may still owe duties to the other parties to 
the EOA.  See EOA §§ 18.1, 18.2.  The potential existence of such duties, however, has no bearing on the claims brought by 
Net. "
225,6," Net contends that the four-year limitations period on its damages claim against ASC has not yet expired.  It argues that the 
running of the limitations period was tolled until Korvette abandoned the lease, because the amount of damages was not 
ascertainable until that time.  See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-42, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. 
Ct. 795 (1971). This argument misses the mark.  If ASC has caused any antitrust injury to Net, it did so at the time that it 
transferred its store area to Net.  Assuming that ASC did commit an antitrust violation at that time, the measure of damages 
would be the decrease in the value of the store area caused by the presence of the COP.  This amount was readily 
ascertainable at the time of the transfer.  Thus, there was no tolling of the limitations period. "
226,7," The successful development of a regional shopping center such as the Springfield Mall requires long-term commitments from 
several large department stores.  See Dalmo Sales Co. v. Tysons Corner Regional Shopping Center, 308 F. Supp. 988, 994 
(D.D.C.), aff'd, 139 U.S. App. D.C. 22, 429 F.2d 206 (D.C. Cir. 1970). Such commitments are necessary at the planning stage to 
attract financing for construction of the shopping center. See 308 F. Supp. at 994. In addition, the financial success of the 
smaller stores in the center will depend on the consumer traffic generated by the department stores.  See id. Thus, the long-term 
presence of the large stores is necessary to attract smaller tenants. Once the developer has set up a functioning shopping center, each major occupant has an incentive to subdivide its store area 
into several smaller stores.  This incentive derives from the fact that subdivision increases the per-foot rental or purchase price 
of a store area.  If, however, all of the large stores subdivided their spaces, the mall would collapse due to the decreased flow of 
consumer traffic. Thus, in economic terms, a free-rider problem exists.  See Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Supreme Court: An 
Analysis of the Restricted Distribution, Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 282, 285 
(1975). See also Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 55, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). A major 
occupant who subdivides effectively obtains a ""free ride"" on the consumer traffic generated by the remaining large stores.  A 
subdivision restriction, therefore, is necessary to prevent the collapse of the shopping center as a functioning unit."
226,8," The court must measure the anticompetitive effect of the developer's veto power in the context of the total competition existing 
in the relevant market. See Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 386 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 59 L. Ed. 
2d 494, 99 S. Ct. 1280 (1979); Optivision, Inc. v. Syracuse Shopping Center Associates, 472 F. Supp. 665, 678 (N.D.N.Y. 
1979). The significance of the competition eliminated in this case is obviously minimal if the developer competes for tenants with 
all of the malls in the surrounding area.  It is of little import that the developer's veto power has a significant impact on this 
particular plaintiff, because the plaintiff occupies only a miniscule portion of the relevant market. "
227,," The Supreme Court's decision in Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959), 
appears at first glance to contradict this analysis.  In that case, the Court held that a group boycott by a department store and 
several appliance manufacturers against a small appliance store was per se illegal, despite the fact that the anticompetitive 
effect on the market as a whole was small.  See id. 212-14. The Court indicated that the small size of the business affected was 
irrelevant.  See id. at 213. The Klor's case, however, is distinguishable from the present controversy, because it dealt with an 
activity that fell into one of the firmly established categories of per se antitrust violations.  See Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 
F.2d at 386. A group boycott is a patently anticompetitive arrangement.  In contrast, the subdivision restriction challenged here 
does not fall into any of the established per se categories.  See id. It also has a purpose other than the stifling of competition.  
See note 7 supra. The rationale of Klor's, therefore, does not apply to the subdivision restriction. "
228,9, See note 7 supra.
228,10," The Virginia Antitrust Act does not mandate application of a per se rule here.  The wording of the Virginia restraint-of-trade 
provision is virtually identical to that of its federal counterpart.  Compare Va. Code § 59.1-9.5 (1982) with 15 U.S.C. § 1 (Supp. IV 
1980). The state act must ""be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose in harmony with judicial interpretation of 
comparable federal statutory provisions."" Va. Code § 59.1-9.17 (1982).  The court, therefore, holds that the Virginia version of 
section 1 follows its federal counterpart in requiring application of the rule of reason in this case."
228,11, See note 7 supra.
228,12," A related factor that decreases the plaintiff's chance of success is the doctrine of unclean hands.  The Fourth Circuit has held 
that ""when parties of substantially equal economic strength mutually participate in the formulation and execution of the [antitrust] 
scheme and bear equal responsibility for the consequent restraint of trade, each is barred from seeking treble damages from the 
other."" Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 15-16 (4th Cir. 1971); accord THI-Hawaii, Inc. v. First Commerce 
Financial Corp., 627 F.2d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 1980). Net obviously has participated in any antitrust conspiracy arising from the "
229,," COP, because it acquiesced in and enjoyed the benefits of that provision for more than five years.  The doctrine of unclean 
hands may even bar the plaintiff from receiving declaratory or injunctive relief, because of the potential for a windfall gain to the 
plaintiff.  See id. "
230,13, The second illustration under § 270 of the Second Restatement of Contracts supports this conclusion:
230,2," .  A contracts with B to deliver all of B's requirements of milk during the following year at B's loading platform at 200 
Lincoln Street.  Before A begins performance, the loading platform is accidentally destroyed by fire, but B has an equally 
suitable platform across the street at 201 Lincoln Street.  Neither A's nor B's duties are affected, except that A is to deliver 
and B is to accept milk at 201 Lincoln Street. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 270, Comment b, Illustration 2 (1981).  This example appears completely analogous 
to the situation in the present case. "
231,*," As indicated, this appeal was submitted November 10, 1981. However, it was held in abeyance pending decision in United 
States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647 (8th Cir. 1982), and United States v. Lemm, 680 F.2d 1193 (8th Cir. 1982). "

237,1, The complaints are identical except for the named plaintiffs.
237,2," Hereinafter, we refer to the incorporated entity which owns and operates the facility as ""John Knox Village,"" ""JKV"" or ""the 
Village."" We distinguish the retirement facility and its residents as ""the community"" or ""the facility."""
237,3," Plaintiffs' complaints did not attach or incorporate by reference an occupancy agreement. An agreement, however, has been 
provided as an appendix to the brief on appeal of defendant-appellee Snyder, Grant and Muehlig. An agreement is also 
contained in the record on appeal as an attachment to defendants' memorandum in support of their motions to dismiss, 
submitted to the district court. HN1[
] Consideration of the occupancy agreement as a matter outside the pleadings would ordinarily convert a Rule 12(b) (6) motion into a motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6) and 56; Sherwood Medical Industries, Inc. v. 
Deknatel, Inc., 512 F.2d 724, 725 n.2 (8th Cir. 1975). The district court, however, expressly noted that no motions for summary 
judgment were filed. All parties and the district court referred freely to the occupancy agreements, apparently assuming that 
such extra-pleading material could be utilized without automatic conversion of the Rule 12(b) motions into proceedings for 
summary judgment. In these circumstances, the motions to dismiss in district court should probably have been converted into speaking motions for 
summary judgment. However, any error in not treating the motions as motions for summary judgment is harmless."
237,4," HN2[
] For purposes of reviewing the granting of a Rule 12(b) (6) motion to dismiss, we accept appellants' factual allegations as true.  Loge v. United States, 662 F.2d 1268, 1270 (8th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 944, 102 S. Ct. 2009, 72 L. Ed. 2d 
466 (1982). "
240,5," Appellees' final argument on the issue of standing involves causation. They contend that appellants have failed to allege injury 
""by reason of a violation of Section 1962,"" as is required by the facial terms of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). This contention reiterates in new guise the argument that no ""enterprise"" is alleged in the complaints. Appellees essentially 
contend that any injury discoverable in the complaints is attributable only to individual acts of mail or wire fraud, rather than to a 
pattern of racketeering conducted through an enterprise. Compare Landmark Savings & Loan v. Rhoades, 527 F. Supp. 206, 
208-09 (E.D. Mich. 1981). We conclude to the contrary that Count I adequately alleges the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise 
through a pattern of racketeering. See Section B, infra."
240,6," HN8[
] An ""enterprise"" is defined by RICO to include any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, 
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity[.]"
240,18, U.S.C. § 1961(4).
240,7," HN9[
] Under RICO, a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which 
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering 
activity[.] "
241,18, U.S.C. § 1961(5).
241,8," We refer to the substantive prohibitions of Section 1962(c). This is the statutory section under which appellants state their 
strongest claim.  Appellants also allege violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) and (b).  Because we conclude that appellants have 
stated a claim under Section 1962(c), we do not reach the question whether claims may also be stated under subsections (a) 
and (b)."
241,9," HN12[
] The RICO Act encompasses two kinds of enterprises: legal entities, and ""associations in fact."" United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 581-82, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981). Where a legal entity is alleged as the RICO 
enterprise, this entity is likely to be clearly distinct from the acts of racketeering. E.g., United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 
660 (8th Cir. 1982) (co-op, as legal entity, would clearly qualify as enterprise); United States v. Anderson, 626 F.2d 1358, 1365 
& n.10 (8th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U. S. 912, 67 L. Ed. 2d 336, 101 S. Ct. 1351 (1981) (County would necessarily 
constitute an ""enterprise"" apart from acts of racketeering, but association in fact of county judges with another for purposes of 
fraud was more problematic). "
242,10," In light of appellants' arguments on appeal that all of these entities are RICO enterprises, it may be appropriate for appellees 
to tender and the district court to consider a Rule 12(e) motion for more definite statement as to the enterprise element. In the interest of aiding the district court and parties on remand, we offer the suggestion that any amended pleadings should 
reflect careful attention to the precise language of the RICO Act. Both Count I and Count II are now poorly pleaded. In each 
count, the defendants are accused of ""engag[ing] in 'a pattern of racketeering activity'"" in violation of the RICO Act. See 
paragraphs 82, 85. This statement, taken in isolation, simply accuses the defendants of engaging in the predicate crimes. This is 
not precisely what the RICO Act forbids. HN13[
] RICO forbids persons from conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of engaging in the predicate crimes.  18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Compare United States v. Anderson, 626 F.2d at 1362 
(quoting indictment which alleged that defendants were persons associated with a named enterprise for purposes of conducting 
the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering). We nevertheless reverse the dismissal of Count I because, elsewhere in that count, it is apparent that at least JKV is alleged to 
be an enterprise."
242,11," Section 1962(c) specifically makes it unlawful for HN15[

] Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind. In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. 
Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally."
243,13," We refer to paragraphs 40, 42, 43.1, 43.2, 46, 67 (a), 67(b) (c) (d), 68 and 70, which identify the time, place and contents of 
the alleged misrepresentations with particularity. Paragraphs 54, 57, 58, 59 and 60 are also sufficiently specific to state a claim 
of fraudulent concealment."
243,14," See paragraphs 38, 41, 43, 66(d)."
243,15," See paragraphs 40, 44, 46, 47, 66(d), 67, 68."
243,16," Finally, appellees SG&M and Prudential argue that the complaint does not allege the element of a ""RICO relationship"" 
between themselves and an enterprise. In other words, these defendants allegedly did not invest racketeering proceeds in, 
acquire control of, or associate with an enterprise.  18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c). The contention is without merit. These defendants were the mortgage lender and accountant to the Village. They were 
""associated with"" an enterprise. "
245,17," In oral argument, the view was expressed that if we recognized appellants' claim as a RICO action, any scheme to defraud 
executed through two mailings would create a civil RICO claim. This misstates the elements of a RICO offense. Under the facial 
terms of section 1962, a RICO claim can only be stated where the scheme to defraud involves an enterprise, and where the 
enterprise is one which ""is engaged in, or the activities of which affect"" interstate commerce. The district court here expressly declined to rule on the interstate commerce element of the complaints. The issue is not before 
us on appeal. "

256,2," Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 16(b)-(h) (hereinafter referred to as the Tunney Act). See Part I(C) and II 
infra. The statute was sponsored by Senator Tunney of California. "
257,3," Western Electric is the wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T that manufactures telecommunications equipment for AT&T's Long 
Lines Department and the Operating Companies. In addition, Western Electric provides telecommunications equipment and 
services to government agencies and, to a limited extent, the independent telephone companies."
257,4," After the transfer of the action to this Court (see slip op. at 17-18 infra) it was docketed here as Civil Action No. 82-0192. The 
1949 lawsuit will generally be referred to herein as the ""Western Electric action."""
257,5, The action thus focused on the practices of defendants with respect to the telecommunications equipment industry.
257,6," Bell Telephone Laboratories, AT&T's telecommunications research and development facility, is a jointly owned subsidiary in 
which AT&T and Western Electric each owns 50 percent of the stock. "
258,7," In a Tunney Act proceeding the Court is not limited by the rules of evidence but may take into account facts and other 
considerations from many different sources. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 16(f)."
258,8," That same day, counsel for AT&T met with Attorney General J. Howard McGrath to make the same request, contending that 
the antitrust litigation was forcing key Bell Laboratories and Western Electric executives involved in important national defense 
projects to divert their attention from that work to preparations for trial. Subcommittee Report at 45-46."
258,9," Secretary of Defense Lovett requested the postponement in a letter to the Attorney General dated March 20, 1952. As stated 
by the Committee, indefinite postponement was requested by the Defense Department despite the fact that neither Mr. Lovett . . . nor anyone 
else in the Department had made an independent investigation to determine whether trial of the suit would actually impede 
the mobilization effort or whether Bell System personnel working on defense matters would actually be needed for 
preparation of trial of the case. Subcommittee Report at 47."
258,10, The Defense Department continued to advocate this position for the remainder of 1952. Subcommittee Report at 51.
258,11," In reviewing Price's memorandum and other information concerning the meeting, the Antitrust Subcommittee characterized the 
government's position as follows: There can be little doubt that by his statements to Mr. Price at the White Sulphur Springs meeting, Attorney General 
Brownell manifested a willingness to have the Justice Department consider a token settlement and forego a decree 
consistent with the public interest -- an attitude denoting partiality toward the defendants incompatible with the duties of his 
public office. Subcommittee Report at 55. "
259,12," During the summer of 1953, the Defense Department asked AT&T to prepare a memorandum explaining why that department 
should be interested in the termination of the antitrust litigation. AT&T obliged, and in early July, it provided the Defense 
Department with a memorandum which urged settlement of the suit without the divestiture of Western Electric. The 
memorandum was drafted in such a way as to make it appear that the Defense Department rather than AT&T had prepared it 
and, with two relatively minor exceptions, a letter identical to the memorandum was sent out the next week to the Attorney 
General over the signature of Secretary of Defense Wilson. Subcommittee Report at 55-56."
259,13," The Subcommittee described in some detail how it uncovered evidence of the negotiating process between AT&T, the 
Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice. It appears that, as part of an attempt to investigate the Justice 
Department's policies and practices regarding antitrust consent decrees, the Subcommittee requested the Attorney General 
make available the files relating to the negotiation and signing of the Western Electric consent decree. Subcommittee Report at 
X-XI. The Department refused to produce the files, and it also declined to supply answers to specific questions. According to the 
Subcommittee (Report at XIII), ""the extent to which the Department of Justice went to withhold information from the committee in 
this investigation is unparalleled in the committee's experience."" In its view, the Department's reluctance to provide information 
""resulted from a desire to cover up those facts which the Department considered to be embarrassing."" Subcommittee Report at 
XIII, 42. Because of the Department's failure to cooperate, the subcommittee acquired the necessary information from ""correspondence, 
memorandums [sic], and other files from AT&T, Western Electric Co., the Department of Defense, and the Federal 
Communications Commission."" Subcommittee Report at XIV. Moreover, with regard to the information provided by the Defense 
Department, the subcommittee criticized that agency for providing the very same material to AT&T, even though it contained 
internal memoranda and correspondence between the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General. Indeed, it appears that 
the Defense Department gave AT&T all of this material the day after AT&T made an oral request for the documents. 
Subcommittee Report at 43."
259,14," The Justice Department contacted the Federal Communications Commission to determine the Commission's position on the 
issue of the divestiture of Western Electric, advising AT&T that it was doing so. AT&T immediately contacted each FCC 
Commissioner individually to convey the Bell System's position on the issue. Subcommittee Report at 71-73. Ultimately, the 
Commission informed the Justice Department that it did not regard the divestiture of Western Electric as essential."
259,15," United States v. Western Electric Co., Civil Action No. 17-49, C.A. 82-0192, Transcript, January 24, 1956, at 5. The transcript 
of the hearing at which the decree was approved is six pages in length. The only substantive question the Court asked was 
whether the defendants would be required to provide patent licensees with ""a general exposition of the know-how"" in addition to 
providing them with manufacturing drawings, blueprints, and specifications. The government responded in the affirmative. This 
one assurance, however, appears to have been directly contrary to AT&T's interpretation of its obligation under the decree. 
During the House Subcommittee's hearings, Chairman Emanuel Celler criticized AT&T's counsel for failing to correct the court's 
misimpression, stating ""by your silence, it strikes me that there was something very much akin to deception on the court, 
because the court must have had an erroneous impression as to what the decree implied and he signed that decree."" Hearings 
at 2258, reprinted in Subcommittee Report at 95-96. "
260,16," The only exception prior to 1980 is a dispute that occurred in the late 1960s when a private communications system carrier 
sought leave to intervene as a party plaintiff to challenge New Jersey Bell's offering of what the proposed intervenor 
characterized as a private communication system to hospitals in violation of the decree. The District Court denied the motion to 
intervene (United States v. Western Electric, C.A. No. 17-49, C.A. No. 82-0192, Order, February 26, 1968) and the Supreme 
Court affirmed ( Clark Walter & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 392 U.S. 659, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1348, 88 S. Ct. 2286 (1968)."
260,17," However, there was significant activity early in 1981. On May 2, 1980, the Federal Communications Commission had issued 
its so-called Computer II decision.  Second Computer Inquiry, 77 F.C.C.2d 384 (1980), on reconsideration, 84 F.C.C.2d 50 
(1980), on further reconsideration, 88 F.C.C.2d 512 (1981), appeal pending sub nom.  Computer & Communications Industry 
Ass'n. v. FCC, et al., D.C. Cir. 693 F.2d 198 (and Consolidated Cases). In that decision, the FCC in essence modified the 
interstate telecommunications regulatory structure in three ways: first, it distinguished between basic transmission services 
traditionally provided by common carriers and enhanced network services such as those used for computer data processing; 
second, it found that enhanced services and customer premises equipment should not be regulated as common carrier 
offerings; and third, it concluded that AT&T should be allowed under the Communications Act to offer such services and such 
equipment but only through a fully separate subsidiary. The Computer and Communications Industry Association and others 
have appealed the Computer II decision to the Court of Appeals for this Circuit, and that appeal is still pending. In the wake of the FCC's decision, AT&T and Western Electric on March 4, 1981, filed a ""Motion for Construction"" of the consent 
decree in the Western Electric case with the District Court in New Jersey requesting a ruling that the decree would not bar AT&T 
from furnishing the services authorized by Computer II. The motion was opposed by the government, but on September 4, 1981, 
the Court granted AT&T's request.  United States v. Western Electric Co., 1981-2 Trade Cases para. 64,275 (D.N.J. 1981). The 
government initially took an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On January 8, 1982, contemporaneously with 
the proposed settlement of these cases, the government and AT&T filed a joint motion to dismiss the appeal and to vacate as 
moot the District Court's order. The Third Circuit granted the motion on February 2, 1982, and on March 12, 1982, the District 
Court vacated its order. United States v. Western Electric, C.A. No. 17-49, C.A. No. 82-0192, Order, March 25, 1982."
260,18," The government has indicated that it brought the 1974 suit because in its judgment the 1956 consent decree was not 
adequate to prevent activities that unreasonably restrained competition in telecommunications equipment markets, and did not 
protect against antitrust violations in the intercity telecommunications field. Competitive Impact Statement at 5 filed by the 
Department of Justice February 10, 1982. This Court has held that the 1956 decree did not bar the filing of the 1974 action 
under the doctrine of res judicata.  United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1374. The 1974 lawsuit will generally be 
referred to herein as the "" AT&T action."""
260,19," The twenty-two Bell Operating Companies, most of which are wholly owned by AT&T, provide the means by which local 
telephone service is furnished. Bell customers presently also gain access to the network for both local and long distance 
telecommunications services through the Operating Companies. These Operating Companies are regulated by the various state 
public utility commissions. They may encompass several states, a single state, or only a single metropolitan area. "
261,20," The divestiture of all or at least some of the Operating Companies remained one of the government's principal alternative relief 
requests. See Part IV infra."
261,21," Discovery was first stayed for almost twenty-two months while the Court resolved certain jurisdictional issues (Pretrial Order 
No. 1) and then again, this time by the Court of Appeals, while defendants appealed from an order this Court had issued on 
November 24, 1976 and then sought certiorari in the Supreme Court."
261,22," Three major legal issues were addressed, as follows: (1) whether the Court had jurisdiction over the action in light of the 
federal and state regulatory scheme; (2) whether all of the departments and agencies of the United States constituted the party 
plaintiff in this suit for purposes of discovery; and (3) whether the government could secure documents obtained in private 
antitrust suits against the defendants. Defendants unsuccessfully sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals and a 
writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court with respect to portions of the order."
261,23, Ultimately only three Statements of Contentions and Proof were filed because the fourth Statement became unnecessary.
261,24, Plaintiff's final Statement consisted of 1870 pages; defendants' third Statement of 2145 pages.
261,25," To oversee discovery disputes, the Court relied upon the Magistrate and upon two Special Masters appointed by the Court. In 
Pretrial Order No. 16, the Court also ordered the Special Masters to supervise the judicial notice procedure established by the 
Court. The purpose of this procedure was to determine what documents would be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding their 
appearance as hearsay documents, for the truth of the matters stated therein. See United States v. AT&T, supra, 498 F. Supp. 
353. For both discovery and judicial notice disputes, the parties could appeal the rulings of the Magistrate and of the Special 
Masters to the Court."
261,26," The 82 episodes were recorded on over 4,200 computer printout pages. By the time of trial, some episodes and some 
contentions had been dismissed by the parties."
261,27," For a more detailed explanation of this process, see United States v. AT&T, supra, 88 F.R.D. 47. "
262,28," Under 15 U.S.C. § 16(a), in any civil or criminal antitrust suit brought by the United States, a final judgment or decree to the 
effect that a defendant has violated the antitrust laws ""shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant under said laws as 
to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto: Provided, That this 
section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken."""
262,29," Initially, only a two-week recess had been sought and granted, but this was subsequently extended to allow the incoming 
Reagan Administration and the new leadership of the Department of Justice to evaluate the pending settlement proposals. See 
this Court's Memorandum Orders of January 16 and January 30, 1981."
262,30," The trial record in this case contains over 24,000 transcript pages."
262,31," The parties have designated their agreement as a ""Modification of the Final Judgment."" However, since the agreement 
encompasses far more than a modification of the 1956 judgment -- and, indeed, as described at slip op. at 13-17 infra, deals 
primarily with the AT&T lawsuit -- it would be misleading to refer to the agreement as a modification of the 1956 decree. The 
agreement will generally be referred to herein as the ""proposed decree."""
262,32," The parties also filed a Memorandum suggesting procedures for evaluating the settlement proposal and a motion to transfer 
the Western Electric action to this Court. In addition, they filed a joint motion to dismiss the appeals pending in the Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit from the District Court's decision concerning the 1956 consent decree. See note 15 supra."
262,33," Order filed January 8, 1982."
262,34," The description of the agreement in this part of the opinion is general in nature, and it takes account neither of various 
qualifications and exceptions in the agreement itself nor of the possible impact of a plan of reorganization which AT&T will be 
required to submit later. These, more specific, issues are discussed in Parts IV through XI infra. "
263,35," Competitive Impact Statement at 30. The exchange areas would generally not be smaller than the area served by a so-called 
Class Four Office. See slip op. at 125-27 infra."
263,36," AT&T would have the initial responsibility for drawing the boundaries of exchange areas, but its plan would have to be 
submitted to the Department of Justice for its approval."
263,37, Also referred to herein as intraexchange service. This may roughly be equated with local telephone service.
263,38," That is, they would provide local access to interexchange carriers."
263,39," In general, this is the service commonly known as long distance service."
263,40," The Operating Companies must also provide access services to link their subscribers with companies providing information 
services. This category of service, discussed in Part VI, infra, includes information retrieval, automatic telephone answering 
services, and electronic publishing."
263,41," The number of new Operating Companies is not specified in the settlement proposal. AT&T has indicated that its 
reorganization plan will provide for the amalgamation of the twenty-two Operating Companies into seven regional Operating 
Companies."
263,42, The proposal would permit AT&T to determine the method by which divestiture will take place.
263,43," If a facility had both intraexchange and interexchange functions, it could not be jointly owned by AT&T and the Operating 
Company, but it could be shared through a leasing or similar arrangement, provided the Operating Company retained control 
over the intraexchange portion of the facility. "
264,44," The proposal would further bar AT&T from reacquiring the stock or assets of the divested Operating Companies, and it would 
require the cancellation of the License Contracts between AT&T and the Bell Operating Companies and of the Standard Supply 
Contract between Western Electric and the Operating Companies."
264,45," The information access functions performed by the Operating Companies for providers of information services would also be 
subject to the equality requirement."
264,46," Appendix B of the proposed decree describes in greater detail the requirement imposed by Section II on the Operating 
Companies to provide equal access to all interexchange carriers. According to the Competitive Impact Statement, these 
provisions are based on the principles (1) that the Operating Companies should have latitude to provide access in the manner 
they deem most efficient, (2) that they must meet performance and pricing criteria to ensure equal access, and (3) that a 
transition period is necessary to phase in these equal access requirements. See Part VIII infra."
264,47," The limitation of the proposed decree's res judicata effect is apparently designed to prevent its use in private antitrust litigation 
as prima facie evidence of AT&T's liability pursuant to section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(a). See note 25 supra and 
Part X infra."
264,48," There are special exceptions for privileged materials, and information collected may not be disseminated except to the FCC 
and in connection with court proceedings to secure compliance. "
265,49," Order filed January 21, 1982. See Part I(C) infra."
265,50, 15 U.S.C. § 16(e). 
266,51," The theory apparently was that the Tunney Act does not apply to such modifications of existing decrees because most 
modifications are relatively minor and of interest only to the parties involved. There appears to be conflicting law on this subject. 
Compare United States v. Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass'n., 1981-2 Trade Cas. para. 64,370 (C.D. Cal. 1981) with United 
States v. Swift & Co., 1975-1 Trade Cas. para. 60,201 (N.D. Ill. 1975). Nevertheless, the government recognizes that when a 
major modification of an existing decree is proposed, the Tunney Act procedures ""help facilitate thorough exposition and review."" 
See Letter of Assistant Attorney General William F. Baxter to the Court (January 18, 1982). To this end, Tunney Act or 
comparable procedures have been followed at least in cases where major modifications of decrees have been made. See note 
67 infra."
266,52," As the Court has previously commented (see Tr. 25040-45), there appear to be at least two problems with the parties' 
""dismissal"" theory. First, for all intents and purposes, the settlement would dispose primarily not of the 1949 action (which 
matured into a consent decree in 1956 -- 26 years ago) but of the lawsuit that at the time of the settlement was actively in trial 
and had been in trial for ten months. Indeed, as the recitation in Part I(B) above demonstrates, the proposed decree deals 
almost exclusively with AT&T -- rather than Western Electric -- issues. These basic facts cannot be obscured by the facile 
expedient of filing the proposal in New Jersey and denominating it a modification of the New Jersey decree. Second, while Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1) provides that the parties may file a dismissal without leave of court under certain circumstances, this may not 
be done where a statute provides otherwise. In the view of the Court, the Tunney Act is just such a statute. Contrary to the parties' continued protestations that, notwithstanding these considerations, the AT&T litigation has been 
dismissed because they allegedly filed a dismissal notice, the lawsuit is pending and very much alive. As noted, this Court 
issued an order on January 8, 1982, that the dismissal notice was only to be lodged, not filed. Whatever may be the proper rule 
in other circumstances -- a matter on which the Court expresses no opinion -- at least when the dismissal of a major antitrust 
action has substantive aspects or is so closely tied to a ""modification"" of another decree as is the case here, Tunney Act 
procedures apply. The parties have not appealed the Court's decisions which refused the filing of the dismissal notice and 
required application of Tunney Act procedures."
266,53, Tr. 25039-46. See also Part II(A) infra. 
267,54," This willingness took especially concrete form after the Court expressed its views on the matter on January 12, 1982. See 
note 49 supra; letter from Assistant Attorney General Baxter to the Court (January 18, 1982); letter from Jim G. Kilpatrick, 
General Attorney for AT&T, to the Court (January 18, 1982)."
267,55," The parties have also stated that in their view the early approval by the New Jersey District Court of the settlement proposal 
does not preclude this Court from following the full Tunney Act procedures. See, e.g., Response of the United States to Public 
Comments, May 20, 1982 [hereinafter Department of Justice Response to Comments]; Reply Comments of the American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co., May 21, 1982 [hereinafter AT&T Reply Comments]; letter of the parties to the Court dated 
January 18, 1982; statement of counsel for the parties, January 12, 1982 (Tr. 25,016-26)."
267,56," See, e.g., United States v. Swift & Co., 1975-1 Trade Cas. para. 60,201 (N.D. Ill. 1975); United States v. Ling-Temco-Vought, 
Inc., 315 F. Supp. 1301 (W.D. Pa. 1970); United States v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co., 1968 Trade Cas. para. 72,345 
(E.D.N.Y. 1967); United States v. Carter Products, Inc., 211 F. Supp. 144 (S.D.N.Y. 1962)."
267,57," However, on February 5, 1982, in its filing disclosing its lobbying activities in conformity with section 11 of the Court's order of 
January 21, 1982, AT&T stated that it made that filing ""in conformance with § 2(g) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act 
('APPA'), 15 U.S.C. § 16(g)"" rather than under the Court's order. In its subsequent public advertisements, AT&T has likewise 
taken the position that the settlement proposal is being reviewed by this Court ""as provided in the antitrust statutes."" See, e.g., 
AT&T Advertisement ""A Plea for Orderly Policy-making,"" Washington Post, March 28, 1982, at A28."
267,58," On January 28, 1982, the government published the proposed decree in the Federal Register (47 Fed. Reg. 4166 (1982)); on 
February 5, 1982, AT&T filed with the Court its description of the written and oral communications made on its behalf with any 
officers or employees of the United States regarding the proposed decree; on February 10, 1982, the government filed with the 
Court its Competitive Impact Statement, and on February 17, 1982 published it in the Federal Register (47 Fed. Reg. 7170 
(1982)); beginning on February 19, 1982, the government made copies of the proposed decree available at the twenty-six district 
courts specified in the Court's order of January 21, 1982; over a period of two weeks in February, 1982, the government 
published in newspapers of general circulation in these twenty-six districts, a summary of the proposed decree and the 
Competitive Impact Statement and directions for the submission of written public comments; from February 19 to April 20, 1982, 
there was a sixty-day public comment period; on April 21, April 23, April 27, and May 4, 1982, the government filed these written 
comments with the Court; as set forth in the Court's order of May 5, 1982 and in lieu of publishing all written comments, on May 
10, 1982, the government issued a press release describing the procedures for obtaining copies of comments, and on May 17, 
1982 published the press release in the Federal Register (47 Fed. Reg. 21214 (1982)); on May 17, 1982, the government 
published in the Federal Register the name and address of everyone who filed a written comment and the number of pages in 
each comment (47 Fed. Reg. 21214 (1982)); and on May 20, 1982, the government made available in each of the twenty-six 
districts referred to above a copy of every comment received."

268,61," The order explained that under the Tunney Act, permission to intervene is strictly within the Court's discretion; that it was 
premature to allow anyone to intervene because the public comment procedures provided ample protection for all legitimate 
interests at that stage of the proceedings; that at the end of the public comment period, the Court would establish a framework to 
ensure effective participation in further proceedings and would again consider what status should be given to participants; and 
that the denials to intervene were without prejudice to appropriate applications to intervene made at some later date. Subsequent requests for intervention were disposed of on a similar basis. On March 25, 1982, for example, the Court denied the 
petition to intervene of the Public Service Commission for the District of Columbia and it reiterated (1) that there is no absolute 
right to intervene in these proceedings, and (2) that for the reasons stated in the February 5, 1982 order, no useful purpose 
would be served by allowing permissive intervention at this stage. Following the entry of that order, the Commission petitioned 
the United States Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus directing this Court to permit it to intervene. In an order issued April 8, 
1982, this Court denied a motion for a stay of all proceedings pending the appellate review, finding that none of the elements 
required for the granting of such relief had been satisfied. On June 1, 1982, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for a writ of 
mandamus, granted AT&T's motion to dismiss, and denied as moot the Commission's motion for a stay of proceedings, its 
motion for oral argument, and its motion to expedite appeal. In an accompanying Memorandum, the Court of Appeals stated ""we 
conclude that the District Court was correct in denying intervention of right at this stage of the proceedings."" United States v. 
AT&T, C.A. No. 82-1321, Order and Memorandum (D.C. Cir. June 1, 1982). Petitions to intervene filed by other participants were denied in orders issued April 14, May 5, and June 4, 1982. In addition, on 
August 2, 1982, the Court of Appeals granted the motion of the State of Michigan to dismiss voluntarily its appeal of this Court's 
denial of its motion to intervene. United States v. AT&T, No. 82-1389 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 2, 1982). However, in an order issued May 
25, 1982, which established further procedures to focus and sharpen the various issues raised during the public comment 
period, the Court invited all interested persons to apply for intervenor or amicus curiae status to the extent that they believed and 
could demonstrate that such status was necessary and appropriate to protect their particular interests. For subsequent 
developments regarding intervention, see Part XI infra."
268,62," In its February 5, 1982 order, the Court established a separate docket, Misc. No. 82-0025 (PI), for the filing of all documents 
relating to the public interest proceedings. The documents in this file have been treated as part of the record and have been 
utilized by the Court in considering the various issues raised in the public interest proceedings. For this docket, normal filing 
rules were waived to permit maximum participation by individual citizens as well as by persons and organizations represented by 
counsel."
268,63," On July 27, 1982, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance of the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and four of his colleagues, forwarded to the Court a letter with a number of 
recommendations and copies of the subcommittee's hearings on H.R. 5158, a bill to amend the Telecommunications Act of 
1934. Copies of the letter were served on counsel for both parties; the Court ordered a copy placed in the court jacket; and it has 
considered these views pursuant to subsection (f)(2) of the Tunney Act."
268,64," The next day, pursuant to leave of Court, AT&T filed its own reply to the comments. "

requirements of the statute in these proceedings. See slip op. at 19-22 supra."
269,67," The standards are the same whether the judgment is regarded as ""new"" or as a modification of the 1956 decree in the 
Western Electric action. See United States v. Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass'n, 1981-2 Trade Cas. para. 64,370 (C.D. Cal.

public interest test); United States v. Swift & Co., 1975-1 Trade Cas. para. 60,201 (N.D. Ill. 1975) (applying public interest test). 
Courts have applied a stricter standard of review only when modifications of existing decrees are contested by one of the 
parties. See United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 76 L. Ed. 999, 52 S. Ct. 460 (1932); Note, Construction and Modification 
of Antitrust Decrees, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 296, 304 (1977)."
269,68," The importance of consent decrees as an antitrust enforcement tool -- as evidenced by the fact that they were entered in 
approximately 80 percent of the government's cases at the time the Tunney Act was passed -- was the source of much of the 
legislators' concern. See H.R. Rep. No. 93-1463, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1974); 119 Cong. Rec. 3455 (1973) (Remarks of Sen.

269,70," Senator Tunney stated: Regardless of the ability and negotiating skill of the Government's attorneys, they are neither omniscient nor infallible. The 
increasing expertise of so-called public interest advocates and for that matter the more immediate concern of a defendant's 
competitors, employees, or antitrust victims may well serve to provide additional data, analysis, or alternatives which would 
improve the outcome. "

Department's enforcement efforts (119 Cong. Rec. 24600 (1973)) and that the Department sometimes simply did not insist upon 
sufficient remedial action by the defendant. 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973)."

the Department of Justice had consented to a decree which completely failed to alleviate the conditions found to violate the 
antitrust laws; to the 1956 decree in the Western Electric action (see Part I supra); and to the questionable circumstances 
surrounding the consent decrees entered in 1971 in cases involving the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. (see The

the Government's judgment in negotiating and accepting [a] consent decree."" Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, 366

587, 48 S. Ct. 311 (1928). The statute represents an endorsement of the line of cases in which courts examined proposed 
consent decrees to determine whether they were in the public interest. E.g., United States v. Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc., 315 F. 
Supp. 1301 (W.D. Pa. 1970); United States v. Carter Products, Inc., 211 F. Supp. 144 (S.D.N.Y. 1962). See Senate Hearings,

Mass. 1975)."
270,76," The Court's powers are not restricted by the circumstance that bills are pending in Congress concerning several of the issues 
raised in this case. The Tunney Act requires the Court to evaluate the decree proffered to it by the parties, and it is clear that it 
may not avoid this mandate merely because Congress might at some future date enact legislation in the same field. Just as the 
Court refused to delay the trial of the AT&T action when it was apprised of the possibility of legislative action (see order filed July 
29, 1981; Transcript of Proceedings, July 29, 1981, at 8-10, 13-14) so it could not now abdicate its responsibilities with respect 
to the proffered decree because of possible future legislative activity. Congress may, of course, enact legislation overturning a 
decree entered by this Court. "
271,77," The statute specifies several criteria which a court ""may"" consider in making its public interest determination (see 15 U.S.C. § 
16(e)(1), (2)) but the legislative history indicates that the listing of these factors was not meant to limit the court's inquiry. S. Rep. 
No. 93-298, supra, at 6; 120 Cong. Rec. 36344 (1974) (Remarks of Rep. Jordan); 119 Cong. Rec. 24599 (1973) (Remarks of 
Sen. Tunney). These criteria therefore cannot be regarded as embodying the standard against which a proposed decree is to be 
measured. For further discussion of these factors, see note 93 infra."

272,81," The parties to this litigation as well as most interested third persons have expressly recognized that, in assessing whether the 
proposed decree is in the public interest, the Court may consider factors other than its effect on competition."
272,82," However, where only one form of relief will effectively remedy the antitrust violation, it is that relief which must be imposed, 
regardless of its impact on other interests.  National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, supra, 435 U.S. at 697-

parties acted to safeguard the pension rights of the employees of the defendant. "

273,85," The Bell System's total operating revenues in 1979 were over $45 billion, and in 1980, they exceeded $50 billion. These sums 
represent almost two percent of the gross national product of the United States in each of these years. The Bell System's net 
income for 1979 and 1980 was $5.6 billion and $6 billion, respectively. During 1979, the Bell System's net assets devoted to 
telephone service were valued at approximately $99.3 billion. At the end of 1979, the Bell System employed over one million 
people, and it was thus the largest employer in the United States with the exception of the federal government. Episode 5/57A,

(1982)."
273,86," There have been suggestions by some that the issues in these cases, involving as they do national telecommunications 
policy, should be left by the Court for Congress to decide. For the reasons stated in note 76 supra and otherwise, this is 
inappropriate. At the same time, a subject of this importance should not be decided solely by an agreement between the 
Department of Justice and a single company. The involvement of the Judiciary under the Tunney Act thus provides a useful 
safeguard."
273,87," See, e.g., Senate Hearings, supra note 72, at 71."
273,88," In addition, the Court has received comments and briefs concerning the proposed decree from several hundred interested 
persons, as well as voluminous submissions from the parties."
273,89," In United States v. Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc., supra, 315 F. Supp. at 1309, the absence of a record forced the court to rely 
upon the parties' assurances that the proposed decree was in the public interest."
273,90," In fact, the parties sought review of the proposed decree in this Court precisely because of its ""substantial expertise on the 
competitive situation in the telecommunications industry."" Letter from Assistant Attorney General William F. Baxter, dated 
January 18, 1982. "
274,91," See slip op. at 19-21 supra. Because of the method the parties chose, that proposal might either have escaped Tunney Act 
review altogether or it might at best have been reviewed only to the extent agreeable to them. See, e.g., the Memorandum in 
Connection with Stipulation and Modification of Final Judgment, filed by the parties in the District Court in New Jersey which 
refers to the procedures in restrictive terms, mentioning specifically only the publication and Federal Register requirements of 
the Tunney Act."
274,92, See also note 145 infra.
274,93," This standard encompasses the criteria specified in the Tunney Act except for ""consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be 
derived from a determination of the issues at trial."" 15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(2). This factor directs the Court to consider the effect of the 
proposed decree upon the ability of private antitrust plaintiffs to recover against the defendant for injuries alleged to have 
resulted from the activity challenged in the government. See 119 Cong. Rec. 3452 (1973) (Remarks of Sen. Tunney). However, 
the legislative history indicates that this is a secondary factor in the assessment of the decree and that the government's 
agreement to make information and evidence available to private plaintiffs will ordinarily be sufficient. S. Rep. No. 93-298, supra 
at 6-7; H.R. Rep. No. 93-1463, supra at 8. The vigor with which several private plaintiffs have pursued actions against AT&T indicates that further prosecution of the 
government's case is not warranted on this basis. In addition, the Justice Department has indicated its willingness to provide trial 
record materials to private plaintiffs. Competitive Impact Statement at 49 n. 34."
274,94," See, e.g., United States v. Gillette Co., supra, 406 F. Supp. at 714-15."
274,95," The Court finds no basis in law or policy for the suggestion made by the FCC and some others that it may have the power to 
modify the proposed decree over the objections of the parties and enter it on its own motion on that basis. If the parties decline 
to incorporate the Court's recommended modifications, the 1956 decree in the Western Electric action will remain in effect, the 
AT&T trial will resume, and the Court will then make its own decision as to liability and, if appropriate, as to remedy. In view of 
the substantial completeness of the record, the parties might elect not to adduce additional evidence, in which event the Court 
would make its decision based on the present record. "

275,99," The District of Columbia Public Service Commission contends that the effect of the antitrust laws upon the District regulatory 
statutes cannot be analyzed under the preemption doctrine because both are congressional enactments. However, courts have 
HN10[
] characterized such local statutes as state laws for the purpose of reconciling them with national policies. See D.C. Federation of Civil Associations, Inc. v. Volpe, 434 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Columbia Plaza Limited Partnership v. Cowles, 
403 F. Supp. 1337, 1341 (D.D.C. 1975); District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Central Labor Council, 442 A.2d 110 (D.C. 
1982). The preemption doctrine would thus be an appropriate gauge of Congress' intent concerning the relationship between the 
D.C. statutes and the antitrust laws. The recent decision in Feldman v. Gardner, 213 U.S. App. D.C. 119, 661 F.2d 1295 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. granted on other 
grounds, 458 U.S. 1106, 102 S. Ct. 3483, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1366, 50 U.S.L.W. 3998.09 (1982), in which the court held that the 
District of Columbia Court of Appeals is immune from antitrust liability, does not require a different result. That case concerned 
antitrust liability, not the respect to be accorded District of Columbia statutes in implementing an antitrust remedy. In light of the 
Feldman Court's conclusion that the District ""remains a federal enclave lacking the sovereignty inherent in statehood,"" it would 
be anomalous if statutes concerning purely local affairs could thwart vindication of a national policy when the statutes of the 
sovereign States cannot have such an effect.  661 F.2d at 1307."
275,100," The Court must decide the preemption issue at this juncture even though no State has yet taken specific action which 
conflicts with the terms of the proposed decree. In the first place, many States have made it abundantly clear that, unless the 
Court acts, they will proceed in a manner inconsistent with the decree. Further, the Court must delineate its powers now with 
respect to the conflicting state claims so as to avoid issuing an overbroad decree. Finally, the possibility that provisions of the 
decree could be vetoed by regulators on a state-by-state basis, with the resulting ""balkanized scheme of telecommunications 
service"" (Joint Comments of Alabama, et al., at 12) would obviously have a bearing on the basic question whether the proposed 
decree would and could effectively open the telecommunications industry to competition. If the States' claims are valid, the Court 
and the parties might have to search for different means to implement the mandate of the Sherman Act herein. It follows that a 
resolution of this legal issue is necessary if the Court is to render a proper determination under the Tunney Act. It may be noted, 
too, that the parties to the settlement as well as those who object thereto are in agreement that a decision by this Court at this 
time is both appropriate and necessary."

276,102," The fact that the decree would be issued pursuant to the parties' consent is irrelevant to its status, for a consent decree has

divestiture -- could be precluded by state regulations concerning the transfer of assets."
279,114," An antitrust defendant would need to find just one sympathetic local regulatory body to achieve immunity from structural relief 
at the behest of a federal antitrust court. "
280,115," There is an obvious difference between direct state regulation and inchoate, general federal antitrust policy, on the one hand, 
and a conflict between such regulation and an explicit, valid federal court order, on the other. Parker deals only with the 
substantive scope of the antitrust laws, that is, with the situation which arises when a State has determined that, with respect to 
certain activities within its jurisdiction, the competition mandated by the Sherman Act is inappropriate for valid state public policy 
reasons. But there is nothing in the doctrine that would prevent the antitrust laws from prevailing when there is a conflict between 
a necessary antitrust remedy in a case in which the federal antitrust court has jurisdiction and in which the antitrust laws have 
been validly applied as a substantive matter and state regulatory schemes which would prevent such a remedy from being 
implemented. To hold otherwise, would be to stand proper deference to the policy of another political entity under the American 
constitutional system on its head."
280,116," For example, the principal alternative to divestiture, a detailed injunction governing defendants' operations, would certainly 
conflict with state laws even more directly and on a continuing basis. While the remedy of damages would presumably still be 
available, it would not necessarily force defendants to cease any anticompetitive conduct. Moreover, there is no indication in the 
statute or in any court decision that the damages remedy is broader than the power to grant injunctive relief. The States' other 
alternative -- an immediate spin-off of the Bell Operating Companies -- would not open the telecommunications market to 
competition and would have severe adverse effects upon the national telephone system. See Part XI(D) infra."
280,117," Nothing in the proposed decree would require a State to replace its regulatory system with a system of competition: it may 
continue to require a regulated monopoly in, say, local telephone service or intrastate toll service."
280,118, See Joint Comments of Alabama and twenty-three other States at 12.
280,119," It is presumably in reliance on these principles that the Department of Justice has conceded that ""the Court should assure 
itself that the provisions of the proposed [decree] will not unnecessarily conflict with important state interests."" Brief at 70. 
Another manifestation of the respect accorded to state interests is the courts' reluctance to impute to Congress an intent to bar 
the States from an entire field of regulation. See, e.g., Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 128, 57 L. Ed. 2d 91, "
281,98," S. Ct. 2207 (1978); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248, 83 S. Ct. 1210 
(1963)."
281,120," See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. United States, supra, 405 U.S. at 573; United States v. E. I. duPont de Nemours & Co., supra, 
366 U.S. at 322."
281,121, See Part VII infra.
281,122, See slip op. at 12 supra. 
282,123," Under this provision, a competitor could interconnect with the AT&T network only if the interconnection occurred in switching 
equipment located on the customer's premises where the telecommunication originated or terminated. The effect of this 
restriction was to prevent competitors from entering the intercity market gradually, and thus effectively from entering the market 
at all. For example, because of this restriction, a customer whose sole office was in St. Louis could not choose to use the 
services of an AT&T competitor for part of a route (e.g., from St. Louis to Chicago), and then AT&T's services for the remainder 
of the route (e.g., from Chicago to Bethesda, Md.) because the St. Louis customer did not have the ""premises"" in Chicago that 
AT&T required for interconnection. Thus, to receive service for Bethesda as well as for Chicago, the customer was required to 
purchase both services from AT&T. See United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1354."
282,124," FX (foreign exchange) service permits a customer to make or receive local calls through a distant switching center by 
effectively providing a long extension cord in the form of a dedicated line between the customer's location and a telephone 
company switching system in the distant location (the foreign exchange). See United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 
1355 n. 77. CCSA (common control switching arrangement) is essentially a miniature AT&T long distance network, except for 
the fact that it is used by only one customer, albeit a customer, such as the federal government, with large telecommunications 
needs."
282,125," The government also alleged inter alia that AT&T discriminated against competitors in providing access to local exchange 
facilities; that it conducted interconnection negotiations with competitors in bad faith; and that it engaged in predatory behavior to 
eliminate at least one company as a provider of digital data transmission services.  United States v. American Telephone and 
Telegraph Co., supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1355-56."
282,126," Creamskimming is a term the Bell System used during the AT&T trial and elsewhere to describe the practice of its 
competitors to concentrate their intercity services on routes where the volume of business is high and the costs of service are 
low."
282,127," See, e.g., testimony of John D. deButts (August 27, 1981); Mark Garlinghouse (December 11, 1981); and William Ellinghaus 
(August 12, 1981)."
282,128," Obviously, AT&T preferred to operate as a monopoly provider of intercity services rather than to be forced to compete with 
other common carriers. (This is particularly true because once the FCC adopted a policy of competition, AT&T would be required 
to allow competitors to interconnect with the AT&T network). Thus, AT&T's self interest dovetailed neatly with its public interest 
argument. "
283,129," Under the antitrust laws, the burden would be on AT&T to show that what would otherwise be clearly unreasonable restraints 
on competition were cleansed by the regulatory directives. See, e.g., National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Center v. 
Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 101 S. Ct. 2415 (1981); Sound, Inc. v. AT&T, 631 F.2d 1324 (8th Cir. 1980); Mid-
Texas Communications Systems, Inc. v. AT&T, 615 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir. 1980); Essential Communications Systems, Inc. v. 
AT&T, 610 F.2d 1114 (3rd Cir. 1979); United States v. AT&T, 524 F. Supp. at 1345, n. 14; United States v. AT&T, 461 F. Supp. 
at 1320-30."
283,130," See, e.g., United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1364-65 n. 118; testimony of William Ellinghaus and Mark 
Garlinghouse on cross examination, note 127 supra. AT&T's cost data were often confusing, incomplete, and inaccurate, and 
although some of its distinguished economists provided helpful and sophisticated economic analysis (e.g., William J. Baumol, 
December 7, 1981), others (e.g., Jules Joskow, October 23, 1981) did little to explain away the shortcomings of these data. At 
least on the basis of the evidence heard before the trial was recessed, the Court would be unable to conclude that AT&T's past 
pricing strategy did not pose anticompetitive problems."
283,131," See Technical Analysis of the Common Carrier/User Interconnections Area by the Panel on Common Carrier/User 
Interconnections, National Academy of Sciences (1970), PX781 (admitted in evidence on behalf of defendants at Tr. 13500, 
August 24, 1981)."
283,132," See, e.g., testimony of Charles Elmendorf (November 17, 1981); Robert B. Brunson (August 25, 1981)."
283,133," Throughout the trial, AT&T referred to four harms to the network: hazardous voltages, longitudinal imbalance, excess signal 
power, and improper network control signaling. These harms, it was alleged, could cause a variety of problems, ranging from 
severe physical injury to humans to a small amount of noise on a telephone line."
283,134," See, e.g., direct and cross examination of Donald H. Erickson (August 6, 1981), Edward Goldstein (August 4, 1981), and 
William Ellinghaus (August 12, 1981). It should also be noted, however, that, with respect to a number of these problems, AT&T 
did provide factual explanations of varying degrees of persuasiveness. Compare the testimony of Lawrence A. Hohmann 
(August 24, 1981) with that of Robert B. Brunson (August 25, 1981) who was convincing notwithstanding severe cross 
examination by the government. "
284,135," Under a certification program, non-Bell equipment may be connected directly to the AT&T network -- without the use of a PCA 
-- provided that the equipment has been certified as meeting certain technical standards."
284,136," There is some merit to AT&T's claim that it was the FCC, rather than AT&T, that was responsible for the delay in the 
development of standards. Specifically, although the question of certification as opposed to PCA arose as early as 1968, the 
FCC did not request technical comments on the standards it had proposed until 1975."
284,137," It should be noted, however, that the government's procurement case was not extremely strong. In the first place, it consisted 
only of sixteen individual ""episodes."" Measured against the large field of procurement decisions in which the Bell System was 
engaged, this was not a formidable number. It is difficult to evaluate, and the Court will not now evaluate, whether this relative 
paucity of evidence was due to intrinsic problems of proof when dealing with a company of the size of AT&T, or whether, having 
conscientiously and carefully surveyed Bell's activities, the government was simply unable to produce more than sixteen 
questionable episodes because no more even arguably anticompetitive activity had taken place. Moreover, even as to those 
sixteen episodes the proof was not overwhelming. Where the government's evidence tended to demonstrate anticompetitive 
acts, AT&T's market share was generally not high; where market share was high, there was relatively little evidence of 
anticompetitive acts. The part of the case dealing with pricing of equipment sold by Western Electric was dismissed on September 11, 1981. See, 
United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1380-81. "
285,138," See also 21 Cong. Rec. 2460, 2569 (1890) (Remarks of Sen. Sherman); 21 Cong. Rec. 2598 (1890) (Remarks of Sen. 
George)."
285,139," A number of distinguished commentators have challenged this interpretation of the antitrust laws, claiming that the promotion 
of consumer welfare through ensuring free competition is their sole goal. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 50-89 (1978); 1 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, supra at §§ 103-112. Resolution of this dispute may be crucial when the two objectives 
point to different solutions. Here, where the remedy necessary to promote free competition is also likely to reduce the 
concentration of economic power, consideration of the latter would appear to be less controversial. In any event, the cases and 
the legislative history of the Tunney Act empower the Court to consider broad public interest goals, such as this one, in 
evaluating the need for an antitrust remedy."
285,140," See, e.g., G. Robinson, ed., Communications for Tomorrow (1978)."
285,141," Commentators from a wide range of the ideological spectrum agree on this conclusion. Thus, Professor Arthur Schlesinger, 
Jr. has been quoted as stating that ""Karl Marx held that history is shaped by control of the means of production; in our times 
history is shaped by control of the means of communication."" T. White, America in Search of Itself at 101 (1982). Charles 
Marshall, AT&T executive vice president, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader have likewise both noted the displacement of the 
industrial age by the information age. Telecommunications Act of 1982: Hearings on H.R. 5158 Before the Subcomm. on 
Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance of the House Comm. on Energy and Commerce (Part 2), 97th Cong., 
2d Sess. 111, 587 (1982). "
286,142," One may speculate, for example, on the effect on the political life of this nation if a company or group with strong political or 
ideological opinions were to gain effective control of the present Bell System (particularly if the company, additionally, were not 
precluded from entry into information and electronic publishing services). See Part VI(C) infra."
286,143," Any cross subsidization of AT&T's intercity services and equipment manufacturing operations with revenue from its monopoly 
local exchange services will likewise be eliminated."
286,144, This remedy was first proposed in the government's complaint. See Complaint at 14. 
287,145," Competitive Impact Statement at 50-51. The Operating Companies retained by AT&T would have been required to provide 
local telephone service through a separate subsidiary; several other problems would have been dealt with by injunctive 
provisions. This proposal was considered by the parties in early 1981, just prior to the start of the trial in the.AT&T action. At that time, in a 
successful effort to secure a continuance (see slip op. at 11 supra), the parties advised the Court that a concrete settlement had 
been reached, with no substantive issues remaining to be resolved. See Memorandum Order filed January 16, 1981. However, 
the Competitive Impact Statement indicates that, to the contrary, no proposal was ever drafted. Competitive Impact Statement at 
50."
287,146," Id. slip op. at 51-52. This proposal was discussed by the parties ""shortly prior to the negotiations that gave rise to the [present 
settlement]."" Id. slip op. at 51. It would have required AT&T to grant non-discriminatory access for intercity carriers to the Bell 
Operating Companies' local exchange facilities, and it would have imposed limits on Western Electric's sales to the Bell System, 
in addition to limiting the dissemination of information and the rotation of personnel within the Bell System. These injunctive 
provisions would have been monitored by special masters appointed by the Court."
287,147," The Court's evaluation of these remedies is conducted strictly in the context of its decision on the adequacy of a negotiated 
settlement. If the AT&T action were to proceed to final judgment and liability were found, the Court might determine that the 
measures discussed in this segment of the opinion are appropriate remedies, either as alternatives to the divestiture of the 
Operating Companies or in addition to such divestiture."
287,148," Because of their conceptual similarities, the first and second alternate remedies are being discussed together."
287,149," The additional divestiture of several Bell Operating Companies would remedy this problem only as to the areas served by 
these divested companies."

288,152," This includes basic scientific advance, cheaper and better products for consumers, foreign trade, and national defense."
288,153," In light of AT&T's agreement to divest the Operating Companies, the predictions made by a number of eminent witnesses 
regarding the dire consequences certain to follow from such divestiture appear in retrospect to have been vastly overrated."
288,154," It is claimed, for example, that after the legal defense against interconnection of non-Bell equipment became impossible to 
sustain, AT&T shifted to claims that inferior equipment was being produced by non-Bell manufacturers; alleged that harms to the 
network would result from such equipment; and sought regulation by state as distinguished from federal agencies; and the like. 
See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Involuntary Dismissal in the AT&T action at 296-359."
288,155," For these reasons, and because of the enforcement problems discussed below, HN25[

type of detailed injunction in favor of the ""surer, cleaner remedy of divestiture."" United States v. E. I. duPont de Nemours & Co.,

Nina Cornell (June 19, 1981); testimony of Bruce Owen (June 22, 1981). "
289,157," Recent developments in governmental policy point to a further reduction in the funding, the authority, and hence the 
effectiveness of regulatory agencies such as the FCC."
289,158," From a philosophical point of view, such a remedy could contravene the separation of powers doctrine because it would 
involve the creation of a substantial quasi-legislative, quasi-executive bureaucracy within the Judicial Branch of the government. 
Practically, the remedy could be impossible to administer because of the need for substantial budgetary authority and a large 
administrative apparatus."
289,159," Careful consideration and independent analysis have been particularly appropriate because these objections were primarily 
voiced by individual citizens who lacked the resources to present detailed briefs."
289,160," There is a dispute, reflected at the trial as well as in other forums, over the question whether local telephone services has 
ever actually been subsidized by intercity service as AT&T has consistently claimed. See Testimony of John D. deButts (August 
27, 1981); testimony of William J. Baumol (December 7, 1981). The government contended that, to the contrary, local telephone 
revenues have subsidized AT&T's intercity rates (see Testimony of William H. Melody (June 8, 1981); testimony of Nina Cornell 
(June 19, 1981); testimony of Bruce Owen (June 22, 1981)) and since the trial was aborted by the settlement, no final decision 
was reached on this issue."
289,161," Although the decree requires the Operating Companies to file ""cost justified"" tariffs for access charges, it leaves to the 
regulators the decision as to what costs should be included within this calculation. Department of Justice Response to 
Comments at 106-107; AT&T Reply Brief at 22-23. If the regulators chose to retain the cost allocation presently used in the 
separations and settlements process, the subsidy, if any, from interexchange revenues to local rates would remain at current 
levels. Under the proposed decree, state regulators will set access charges for intrastate interexchange service and the FCC will 
set access charges for interstate interexchange service. Department of Justice Response to Comments at 106-107; AT&T Reply "
290,," Brief at 22-23. If a subsidy is required beyond that implicit in the access charges, it may be provided by state or federal 
legislation. See, e.g., H.R. 5158, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. § 234 (proposal for a National Telecommunications Fund)."
290,162," Indeed, their incentive may be even greater after divestiture than it was before, since after divestiture Western Electric will 
have lost its anticompetitive advantage and will instead be forced to compete with other manufacturers on the basis of quality 
and price for the Operating Companies' business."
290,163," The concerns of investors are similarly unfounded. They will retain all their legal remedies for any improper actions by AT&T 
in connection with the divestiture. See Part IX infra."
290,164, 13 F.C.C.2d 420 (1968).
290,165," MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 188 U.S. App. D.C. 327, 580 F.2d 590 (D.C. Cir. 1978). "
291,166, The only limitation regarding AT&T's business activities is that it may not reacquire the Operating Companies.
291,167," This part of the opinion considers general restrictions on AT&T; Part VI deals with restrictions on the provision of information 
services."
291,168, See Part V(C) for a discussion of the claim that AT&T has monopoly power in the equipment manufacturing market.
291,169," In addition to advancing the cross-subsidization argument, those who advocate restrictions on AT&T also raise contentions 
based on discrimination. However, because these discrimination claims take on a variety of forms dependent on the context, the 
Court will address them in its discussion of the specific restrictions that have been proposed."
291,170," Estimates submitted by others were significantly higher, some contending that AT&T's market share exceeds 90 percent. It is 
unnecessary for purposes of this proceeding to resolve the conflict, for the precise amount of the market share is not decisive to 
the Court's holding."
291,171, The Department took a contrary position during the AT&T trial. 
292,172," It must be remembered that the regulatory decisions which introduced competition into the interexchange market are 
themselves relatively recent. It was not until 1978 that the provision of regular long distance telephone service (i.e., MTS/WATS 
type service) became subject to competition. For a survey of the decisions leading to full competition in the interexchange 
market, see Docket 11866, Allocation of the Frequencies in the Bands Above 890 Mc., 27 F.C.C. 359 (1959); Docket 16509,

decisions allowing interexchange carriers to expand their service offerings by reselling and sharing AT&T services have likewise 
been in force only for the last several years.  Regulatory Policies Concerning Resale and Shared Use of Common Carrier

292,173," This reduction in the amount of capital investment is due in part to the development of new technologies, such as satellites 
and microwave towers, and in part to the recent regulatory decisions allowing for the resale and sharing of AT&T services. See 
note 172, supra."
292,174," See, e.g., MCI v. FCC, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 561 F.2d 365 (D.C. Cir. 1977); MCI v. FCC, 188 U.S. App. D.C. 327, 580

Proposed Rulemaking, 81 F.C.C.2d 177 (1980). "
293,175," The Court does not find that there is no possibility that AT&T will use its still considerable market share in an anticompetitive 
manner. It does find, however, that for the reasons cited, both the incentive and the opportunity for anticompetitive conduct will 
after divestiture and on account of divestiture be greatly reduced."
293,176," To the extent that AT&T still has some potential for engaging in anticompetitive behavior, there is of course nothing in the 
proposed decree to immunize it from its obligations under the regulatory decisions or the antitrust laws."
293,177," Most of those who have submitted briefs or comments -- including AT&T's most major interexchange competitors (e.g., MCI 
Corp.) -- either did not address the subject of restrictions on AT&T at all or they agreed with the decree's provisions as drafted."
293,178," E.g., Topic 3 briefs submitted by Association of Data Communications Users and the Utilities Telecommunications Council at 
11; Mobile Marine Radio Inc. at 10; and Satellite Business Systems at 17."
293,179," Such duplication might actually have its drawbacks, for it would make it impossible to alter the present requirements should 
they no longer appear to be in the public interest; (i.e., should the FCC find that, because conditions had become more 
competitive, the present interconnection requirements are no longer warranted). With the divestiture of the Operating 
Companies, regulation of interexchange services will in all probability become more effective since AT&T will no longer be able 
to shift costs in the manner that the government has alleged it has done in the past. "
294,180, Additional reasons for a rejection of this proposal are discussed in Part IV supra.
294,181," In the interexchange equipment market, for example, Western Electric has a variety of competitors which produce switches 
and microwave equipment. In the area of equipment manufacturing for computers and computer-related services, far from being 
the dominant firm, Western Electric will be a new entrant forced to compete with well established domestic and foreign firms."
294,182," To the extent that manufacturers need information from Long Lines, market forces will help to ensure their access: since Long 
Lines will increasingly be forced to compete with other interexchange competitors, it will have the incentive to purchase the best 
equipment at the lowest prices without regard to corporate affiliation. It will therefore be in Long Line's own interest to 
disseminate its own technical information and standards as broadly as possible to enable it to choose from among the widest 
range of products. Finally, as technology in interexchange services advances and carriers turn increasingly to the use of "
295,," microwave towers and satellites, reliance on the AT&T network will decline and the need for obtaining information about the 
AT&T network will increasingly be reduced."
295,183," Far from enhancing competition, the establishment of quotas would produce anticompetitive results: the Operating 
Companies and Long Lines would be precluded from making purchasing decisions on the basis of quality and price."
295,184," Including the members of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce 
who wrote to the Court on July 27, 1982. See note 63 supra."
295,185," Initially, this capacity would presumably be used primarily to connect to high-volume users; eventually the bypass technology 
may permit interconnection to all subscribers."
295,186," Indeed, the protection afforded by a ban on AT&T alone would probably be minimal because it is the carrier least likely to 
exploit the new technology to the fullest inasmuch as its facilities were designed to interconnect with those of the Operating 
Companies. Moreover, there is a safety valve against overreaching: before AT&T, or any other carrier, may install the facilities 
necessary to connect directly to the ultimate customers, it must secure approval from the state regulators. If these regulators find 
for public interest reasons unrelated to competition that bypass should be prohibited, they may do so irrespective of the decree 
in these cases."
295,187," To the extent that the local exchange facilities constitute monopoly bottlenecks, the development of alternative facilities 
actually furthers the competitive purposes of these laws. "
296,188," The proposed decree does nothing to affect existing licensing contracts, most of which last for the life of the patent and 
contain provisions for the licensing of related new patents issued within five years of the execution of the contract. In addition, 
licenses held by the Operating Companies may be sublicensed to others."
296,189," The complaint in the Western Electric action alleged that AT&T engaged in anticompetitive behavior in licensing its own 
patents and in acquiring the patents of others as part of its efforts to monopolize the telecommunications equipment market. 
United States v. Western Electric, supra, Complaint at 18-19. The 1956 consent decree contains no finding of patent abuse, but 
simply states that the terms of the judgment are consented to ""without . . . constituting any evidence or admission by any party in 
respect of any such issues."" 1956 Consent Decree at 1."
296,190," At the same time, AT&T's new-found need to finance its research and development like other competitive firms will exert 
some pressure on it to license its patents to others so that, reciprocally, it may receive patents and technical information from 
them."
296,191," Indeed, this disadvantage could discourage AT&T from spending funds for research and development. The resulting 
diminution of Bell Laboratories' research effort would not be in the public interest. See Part IV supra. "
297,192," In addition, the FCC requires the Operating Companies to make available network interface information necessary for 
interconnection. See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. § 68.110."
297,193," Should AT&T misuse its patents -- for example by improperly refusing to license them -- the aggrieved parties would be free 
to pursue their remedies under the patent and antitrust laws: there is nothing in the decree to diminish any of these rights and 
remedies."
297,194," In addition, until September 1, 1987, the Operating Companies may call upon AT&T, Western Electric, and Bell Laboratories 
to provide ""on a priority basis all research, development, manufacturing, and other support services."" Proposed Decree, Section 
I(C). "
298,195, See Part I supra.
298,196," Section V of the 1956 decree provides, the defendant AT&T is enjoined and restrained from engaging, either directly, or indirectly through its subsidiaries . . . in any 
business other than the furnishing of common carrier communications services; provided, however, that this Section V shall 
not apply to . . . businesses or services incidental to the furnishing by AT&T or such subsidiaries of common carrier 
communications services. Under Section II(i) of the 1956 decree, common carrier communications services are defined as ""communications services and 
facilities, . . . the charges for which are subject to public regulation under the Communications Act of 1934."""
298,197," Section IV of the 1956 decree states that the defendants are each enjoined and restrained from commencing, directly or indirectly, to manufacture for sale or lease 
any equipment which is of a type not sold or leased . . . to Companies of the Bell System, for use in furnishing common 
carrier communications services."
298,198," Although the Court need not at this juncture decide the question whether AT&T could provide any of these information 
services were the 1956 consent decree to remain in effect, it would appear that, unless that decree is vacated, AT&T would be 
precluded from offering most, if not all, of these services. Specifically, it is difficult to imagine how the Court could find either (1) 
that the provision of computer services or electronic news services in competition with others satisfies the 1956 decree's 
requirements that AT&T provide only common carrier communications services the charges for which are subject to public 
regulation under the Communications Act or (2) that these services are ""incidental"" to the furnishing of common carrier 
communications services. Similarly, it appears that under the 1956 decree, AT&T would be precluded from offering the services described in the FCC's 
Computer II decision. In that decision, the FCC ruled that AT&T could offer so-called ""enhanced services"" (which are essentially 
the equivalent of the ""information services"" described in the proposed decree), and customer premises equipment on a non-
tariffed competitive basis, provided that AT&T does so through a fully separate subsidiary. The Commission's decision simply 
means that AT&T is authorized, as opposed to required, to offer these services under the Communications Act; it does not 
relieve AT&T of its obligations under the antitrust laws, and more specifically under the 1956 decree. (The Commission's 
decision is presently on review -- see Computer & Communications Industry Ass'n v. FCC, D.C. Civ. No. 80-1471 (filed May 15, 
1981) -- but the appeal does not alter the underlying legal effect of the Commission's decision in relation to the action before this 
Court.) Finally, it should be noted that, if presented with the issue of whether AT&T is precluded by the 1956 decree from offering these 
non-tariffed competitive services permitted under Computer II, this Court would be deciding that issue de novo, because the 
opinion and order issued by Judge Biunno construing the decree to permit AT&T to offer these services has been vacated by 
order of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. See United States v. Western Electric Co., No. 81-1960 (3rd Cir. Feb. 2, 
1982); United States v. Western Electric Co., No. 49-17 (D.N.J. March 12, 1982). "
299,199," Without control of the local exchange monopolies, AT&T will have no improper advantage over other competitors. See Part 
IV(B) supra. It will not be able to subsidize its offerings with monopoly profits in the interexchange or telecommunications 
equipment markets (see Part V, supra) and there is little likelihood of customer discrimination because these products and 
services, unlike information services, are not closely dependent upon access to the telecommunications network. If a potential competitor poses no threat to the development of a healthy competitive market it should obviously not be barred 
from entering that market. The greater the number of competitors, the more likely it is that consumers will reap the benefits of 
lower prices and product improvements. AT&T is likely to be an especially potent competitor given its manufacturing expertise 
and the resources of Bell Laboratories."
299,200," Other examples of these services include AT&T's Custom Calling II (which allows advance calling and call answering), 
telephone-operated burglar alarm systems, and office management systems (which may provide such diverse functions as 
inventory control, temperature control, and inter-office data communications). "
300,201," Indeed, some of the providers of these information services may themselves have the resources to construct such 
transmission systems."
300,202," Absent the divestiture of the Operating Companies, that conclusion might, of course, be quite different."
300,203," For the reasons stated in Part VII infra, the Court also rejects the suggestion that AT&T be required to offer these services 
through a separate subsidiary."
300,204," The discussion of electronic publishing under the topic heading ""1956 Consent Decree and Line of Business Restrictions"" is 
for the sake of convenience only. The Court's decision -- that permitting AT&T to become an electronic publisher is not in the 
public interest -- was made solely on the basis of the proposed decree here under review and without consideration of whether 
AT&T could offer these services under the terms of the 1956 decree. But see note 198 supra."
300,205," For purposes of this discussion, the Court will use the term electronic publishing. Use of this term is not meant to imply a 
limitation to a particular kind of transmission technology."
300,206," The kinds of services here under review have been discussed under a variety of labels in a number of forums. The 
telecommunications bill introduced in the House of Representatives, for example, used the term ""information publishing service"" 
which was defined as: provision to any unaffiliated person of any information -- (A) which the publisher has (or has caused to be) authored, originated, gathered, collected, produced, compiled, edited, 
categorized, or indexed; or (B) in which the publisher has a direct or indirect financial or proprietary interest. "
301,," H.R. 5158, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. § 263(f)(3) (1982). (The bill was withdrawn by Congressman Wirth on July 20, 1982.) A Senate bill on the same subject referred to ""cable service"" and ""mass media services."" The former term was defined as ""the 
retransmission of any television or radio broadcasting signal, or program origination, for distribution by cable or any other closed 
transmission medium to multiple subscribers who pay to receive such service."" Mass media services were defined as follows: The term 'mass media' includes television and radio broadcasting, pay television, and printed or electronic publications 
(including newspapers, periodicals, and any service or product like or similar to a newspaper or periodical). Such term does 
not include -- (A) telephone number or address listings and directory assistance (limited to telephone number, address, and business 
category); (B) weather, time, or sports information; (C) any information service which AT&T or any affiliate was engaged in on April 7, 1981; or (D) printed or electronic directory advertising. S. 898, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. § 229(f) (1981). Some persons who have commented in this proceeding have urged the Court to adopt the definition used in H.R. 5158; others 
have proposed their own definition. The National Association of Broadcasters, et al. (Topic 6 Brief at 2), for example, urges that 
electronic publishing be defined as the provision of any information which the provider (the publisher), has, or has caused to be, originated, created, compiled, 
produced or selected, and which is intended for members of the public and is distributed via electronic means."
301,207," In addition to the one-way dissemination of information that is the norm in print publishing, electronic publishing also includes 
interactive transaction services. These services allow a consumer not only to receive information at home but also to send 
information back to the publisher. Thus, consumers using a ""shop-at-home"" service, for example, could use their home terminals 
to call up information on products being offered by a particular merchant, and then place their orders for the desired products by 
using their terminals to key in the necessary ordering information."
301,208," The kinds of information referred to in this definition include news, business and financial reports, editorials, columns, sports, 
features, and electronic advertising. The means of transmission include pay television, radio and television broadcasting, and 
electronic publications which appear either by audio means, on video screens, or in printed form. But see note 223 infra. See 
also S. Rep. No. 97-170, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 42-44 (1981)."
301,209," These are the same problems that have been claimed to exist in other markets, but as is apparent from discussion below, 
they take on a different and more serious complexion in this context."
301,210, See Parts V(A) and VI(A) supra. 
302,211," AT&T has already played a major role in developing technical standards for that industry as evidenced by its involvement in 
writing the ""Presentation Level Protocol"" which will be used to code electronic publishing signals and which may become the 
major protocol used by publishers in the United States."
302,212," See, e.g., Testimony of Lowell Hoxie (March 10, 1981); Pier Abetti (March 11, 1981); and Luther R. Hinton (March 20, 1981)."
302,213," For example, the networks of the other common carriers may not be extensive enough to connect a publisher, or a publisher's 
customers, to the required data bases without relying at least in part on facilities provided by AT&T. Moreover, because 
competing facilities are not as extensive as AT&T's, the likelihood of congestion on their transmission lines, which causes the 
calls to receive busy signals, is far greater. It is of course possible that these publishers could use any alternate transmission systems developed to service the needs of 
providers of other types of information services. However, it is not clear that those networks will develop in ways which will meet 
the needs of electronic publishers. Therefore, they cannot be relied upon to serve as a check upon AT&T's power. "
303,214," The court further explained that this diversity is essential because the First Amendment ""presupposes that right conclusions 
are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and 
always will be, folly; but we staked upon it our all."" Id."
303,215," Both the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance and AT&T agree 
with this principle. Congressman Timothy E. Wirth has aptly pointed out that ""the information market provides much more than 
economic good, for assuring a diversity of information sources is critical to the proper functioning of the entire democratic 
system."" Hearings on H.R. 5158, supra, note 141, at Part 3, at 1. Similarly, Charles Marshall, an AT&T executive vice president, 
recently testified before the same subcommittee that ""the best way to assure a diversity of these kinds of information services to 
the American public is to assure a diversity of sources."" Hearings on H.R. 5158, supra, note 141, at Part 2, at 137."
303,216," FCC policies prohibit formation or transfer of co-located newspaper-broadcast combinations ( FCC v. National Citizens 
Committee for Broadcasting, supra, 436 U.S. 775); common ownership of more than one broadcast station in the same area ( 47 
C.F.R. §§ 73.35, 73.240, 73.636); operation of cable systems by a telephone company ( 47 C.F.R. § 63.54); and ownership of 
cable systems by a television network ( 47 C.F.R. § 74.1131). "
304,217," The Court of Appeals, speaking in the same case, was even more explicit. . . . Congress moved under the spur of a widespread fear that in the absence of governmental control the public interest 
might be subordinated to monopolistic domination in the broadcast field [citing case] . . . . The First Amendment ""rests on 
the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to 
the welfare of the public [citing case]. The 'public interest' standard necessarily invites reference to First Amendment 
principles . . . . "" Although no provision of the Communications Act expressly grants the Commission authority to restrict 
newspaper ownership of broadcast stations, such express authority is not essential to the validity of Commission 
regulations. 47 U.S.C. § 309(a) requires the Commission to find the 'public interest, convenience and necessity will be 
served' by the grant of a license. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting v. FCC, 181 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 555 F.2d 938, 948-51 (1977), aff'd in part, 436 
U.S. 775, 56 L. Ed. 2d 697, 98 S. Ct. 2096 (1978)."
304,218," De Tocqueville observed with his usual prescience long ago that revolutions by means of the press would most likely come 
about from its centralization in a few powerful organs. A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1835) chapter XI. Richard 
Reeves who recently retraced de Tocqueville's travels, took note of the development of two-way telecommunications which 
allowed citizens instantaneously to record their thoughts on the political issues of the day, and he commented that "
305,," whoever decides which questions are to be asked and how they are to be worded has enormous power . . . . The results of 
these instant referenda would then be flashing in front of each legislator. A member of Congress, knowing public opinion in 
the district or the country, would then have the dubious honor and politically dangerous duty of voting, perhaps testing his 
or her conscience against the recorded will of the majority. R. Reeves, American Journey 89-90 (1982)."
305,219," The Court explicitly rejected Ford's argument that the manufacturing prohibition removed a potential competitor from the 
market, finding that the restriction was necessary to allow the development of competition in the industry. Id."
305,220," Such a prohibition will not have anticompetitive consequences because AT&T has no special expertise in creating information 
which would make it a potent competitor in this market. It could overwhelm competitors only because of its ability to engage in 
anticompetitive conduct."
305,221," The Court notes that AT&T has stated that, although it does not wish to be legally bound, ""it now has no intention to provide 
information services that would be competitive with the news and features of newspaper or with broadcasting or traditional cable 
television services."" AT&T Reply Brief at 116."
305,222," AT&T may engage in this activity if the information is delivered over transmission facilities in which AT&T has no interest. In 
that case, there would be no possibility of anticompetitive activity, because AT&T would have no control over the transmission of 
its publishing services."
305,223," Beyond that, the Bell System has long been engaged in providing a variety of services which, although relatively minor in 
character, could loosely be regarded as falling into the category of electronic publishing. Because of that involvement without 
significant adverse consequences, it is not necessary in the public interest that AT&T be precluded, and AT&T will not be 
precluded, by the modification required below, from offering the following: electronic directory services including listings of 
general product and business categories, and of the service or product providers under these categories, and their names, 
telephone numbers, and addresses; such traditional Bell System services as time, weather, and such other audio services as 
are being offered as of the date of the entry of the decree to the geographic areas of the country receiving those services as of 
that date; and the dissemination of information to and from AT&T's affiliates. "
306,224," The Court expects to allow any opponents of the removal of the prohibition to comment on the question whether its 
continuation will be in the public interest, and, should they be able to show that competitive conditions clearly require the 
maintenance of the ban, it will not be lifted. However, the burden will at that time be on such opponents to demonstrate that the 
public interest requires the continued exclusion of AT&T from electronic publishing."
306,225," These are the directories currently produced by the Operating Companies or under their auspices, for each geographic region 
which they serve. These directories contain subscriber listings grouped by subject matter along with advertisements."
306,226," No specific provision of the proposed decree deals with directory advertising, but the parties have stated that the general 
prohibition against provision of non-monopoly services includes production of the Yellow Pages. See Competitive Impact 
Statement at 29 n. 24."
306,227," It appears that the Department is the principal proponent of the restrictions on the Operating Companies. AT&T has generally 
taken the stance that it agreed to these restrictions as part of the overall settlement."
306,228, Response to Comments at 54. See also id. at 53-61; Competitive Impact Statement at 27. 
307,229," The Court cannot accept the proposition advanced by some that state and federal regulation alone will eliminate the 
possibility of anticompetitive abuses by the Operating Companies. If regulation could effectively prevent these practices, there 
would have been no need for the AT&T action. See Part IV supra."
307,230," There is no basis for the government's contention that the participation of the Operating Companies in these markets would 
be of little competitive value. Their expertise in telecommunications and their large customer base would make them natural 
competitors in these fields."
307,231," Including the members of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance who 
submitted their views to the Court. See note 63 supra."
307,232," Evidence introduced during the AT&T trial indicated a definite correlation between increases in local telephone rates and the 
number of homes with a telephone. See Testimony of Louis J. Perl (November 23, 1981); Exhibit D-4-1518."
307,233," Some have contended that the Court should not assess the propriety of the restrictions without holding evidentiary hearings 
with regard to the need therefor, their effect upon local rates, and related matters. The legislative history of the Tunney Act 
indicates that the court reviewing a proposed consent decree has broad discretion in fashioning the procedures for the public "
308,," interest review. Both congressional committees stated, ""Only where it is imperative that the court should resort to calling 
witnesses for the purpose of eliciting additional facts should it do so."" S. Rep. No. 93-298, supra, at 6-7; H.R. Rep. No. 93-1463, 
supra, at 8. The record in the AT&T action contains extensive information about the competitive structure of the entire 
telecommunications industry. This Court has relied upon that record in assessing the competitive significance of the proposed 
restrictions, and an evidentiary hearing concerning such matters is therefore not necessary. Similarly, there is no need for a hearing concerning the effect of the restrictions upon local rates. Any testimony on that issue 
could only be speculative and would be unlikely to assist the Court in its public interest determination. In addition, the effect of 
the restrictions upon local rates does not represent the crux of the Court's decision on these questions."
308,234," The Operating Companies would simply be additional competitors in a market that is already quite competitive. See Part V 
supra."
308,235," Competition in the interexchange market would tend to drive prices close to costs. Thus, absent anticompetitive activity, it is 
unlikely that the Operating Companies would be able to earn a profit large enough to provide any meaningful subsidy to local 
rates."
308,236," The proposed decree's clauses permitting AT&T to provide some intraexchange services in competition with the Operating 
Companies are not inconsistent with this result. AT&T will not have the power to disadvantage the Operating Companies 
because the local companies do not require access to AT&T's network to provide exchange telecommunications. It is AT&T that 
will be dependent upon the Operating Companies for access to its customers, not vice versa. "
309,237, For a full discussion of the meaning of this term see Part VI supra.
309,238," For similar reasons, the Court rejects the argument that the Operating Companies can most efficiently provide information 
services by taking advantage of various economies (such as using the same equipment for exchange telecommunications and 
for information services). It would be impossible to determine at any time whether the Operating Companies' advantages were 
due to inherent efficiencies, or to efficiencies created by structuring the network so as to hinder competition. The experience with 
AT&T's activities with regard to interexchange competition indicates that the latter is a possibility which would be difficult to 
detect or prevent."
309,239," The reasons underlying the ban on provision of electronic publishing services by AT&T provide further support for restricting 
the Operating Companies from this activity. See Part VI supra."
309,240," It cannot be claimed that this restriction will result in rate increases: the Operating Companies do not now provide such 
services on any large scale, and it is not at all clear that they would be a great source of profit to them in the future."
309,241," Entry of the Operating Companies into this market is not necessary to provide competition for AT&T. The large amount of 
interest generated by this growing industry indicates that there will be a number of competitors. See Part V(A) supra. "
310,242," Telecommunications equipment is used by a carrier to provide telecommunications services. Proposed Decree, Section 
IV(N). Customer premises equipment is used on subscriber's premises to originate, route, or terminate telecommunications (e.g., 
telephone sets, answering machines). Section IV(E)."
310,243," This rationale does not require the divestiture of Western Electric from the Bell System because AT&T's end products -- 
interexchange services and information services -- will be subject to competitive pressures. If AT&T paid a higher price for its 
equipment and that cost was reflected in higher rates, consumers would switch to a carrier with prices which reflected 
purchasing decisions based upon the principles of best quality and least cost."
310,244," The Department of Justice acknowledges that the registration program established by the FCC, see 47 C.F.R. §§ 68.1 et seq. 
(1981), would somewhat limit the Operating Companies' opportunities to obstruct the attachment to their networks of equipment 
manufactured by others. Response to Comments at 67-68. However, it seems possible that, where the Operating Company is 
the manufacturer of a type of equipment, it would still be able to impose interconnection requirements designed to favor that 
equipment. In addition, the Operating Companies retain the ability to discriminate against equipment manufactured by others 
with respect to types of interconnections, testing, maintenance and similar matters. "
311,245," The proposed decree further prohibits the selling or leasing of telecommunications equipment. However, few objections have 
been raised against this prohibition. There would appear to be little incentive for the Operating Companies to act as retailer for 
this equipment, since the only purchasers would be telecommunications carriers. In the absence of any reasons for removing the 
restriction, the need to guard against coordination between manufacturers and the Operating Companies is sufficient justification 
for this prohibition."
311,246," Such interconnection restrictions would be unlikely in any event. See note 244 supra. It would be even more difficult, if not 
impossible, to draft an interconnection standard that favored a piece of equipment sold by an Operating Company but did not 
likewise favor the same equipment when sold by a competing retailer. Even if an Operating Company were the exclusive retailer 
of certain equipment, it probably could not realistically so tailor the standards as to favor the manufacturer of that particular 
equipment and, should it attempt to do so, the anticompetitive nature of the standard would be apparent on its face."
311,247," The rules governing CPE pricing imposed by the FCC's Computer II decision will also make it more difficult to engage in 
cross subsidization."
311,248," There is no reason to change the allocation of these assets provided for in the proposed decree. The embedded CPE 
consists primarily of Western Electric equipment, and it is therefore appropriately allocated to AT&T. As for the retail stores, 
there is no basis for concluding that the retention of these assets by AT&T will be anticompetitive. The Operating Companies will 
have substantial retail access through their contact with the individual telephone subscribers, and they should be able to build 
their own retail outlets on this basis alone to compete with those of AT&T and others. Some parties have suggested that the embedded CPE should not be transferred to AT&T, claiming that such a transfer would 
have a substantial impact upon the Operating Companies' revenues from interexchange activities. This argument apparently 
proceeds on the theory that the transfer will reduce the Operating Companies' rate bases and therefore also reduce the amount 
they are entitled to receive under the so-called separations and settlements process for the use of their equipment by interstate 
traffic. However, the proposed decree eliminates the division of revenues process and mandates its replacement by a system of "
312,," access charges. Regulatory authorities may set the access charges so as to guarantee the Operating Companies the same 
amount that they received under the separations process irrespective of the rate base. In addition, the FCC's decision in 
Computer II will, if ultimately upheld on appeal, result in the eventual deregulation of all CPE and its removal from Operating 
Companies' rate bases in any event."
312,249," The Operating Companies may be expected to serve as outlets for many of the small equipment manufacturers, providing a 
stimulus both for price competition and for innovative design and manufacturing. The competitive nature of this market makes it 
unlikely that the restriction will have an effect upon local rates."
312,250," Additionally, as is also true with respect to the prohibition on the production of the Yellow Pages directories (see Subpart E 
infra), the avoidance of an unnecessary intrusion into matters of direct interest to the States and state regulators supports 
removal of the prohibition."
312,251," A number of persons have urged that, in the event that it is determined that particular restrictions are not in the public interest, 
the Operating Companies be required to conduct competitive activities through a separate subsidiary. A separate subsidiary 
does not eliminate economic incentives for anticompetitive conduct; it is simply a method of revealing intracompany transactions 
so that regulators may more effectively prevent cross subsidization and other improper behavior. See NARUC v. FCC, 173 U.S. 
App. D.C. 413, 525 F.2d 630, 637 (D.C. Cir. 1976); Second Computer Inquiry, supra note 17, 77 F.C.C.2d 384, 462 (1980). In 
any event, since separate subsidiaries are essentially a regulatory device, it does not seem appropriate, except in the most 
unusual circumstances, for an antitrust court to impose such a requirement. If the legislators or the regulators should conclude, 
for their own reasons, that a separate subsidiary would be appropriate, they may, of course, impose this requirement in the 
exercise of their own responsibilities."
312,252, In some cases the directory is published by an independent organization under contract with the Operating Company.
312,253," The Operating Companies are appropriately prohibited from producing electronic versions of the Yellow Pages, for the 
reasons stated in Subpart B supra."
312,254," The Department of Justice conceded that ""we're not so much worried about competition in print."" Hearing on June 29, 1982, 
Tr. 25184. "
313,255," These competitors only require access to the Operating Companies' subscriber listings, and there is no claim that the 
Operating Companies have withheld the lists to stifle competition. In fact, under the proposed decree, they would retain control 
of the listings. Department of Justice Response to Comments at 71."
313,256," It does not even seem to be true that, as the Department of Justice assumes, the Yellow Pages fall as a purely formalistic 
matter on the competitive side of the monopoly-competition dichotomy. See, e.g., Telecommunications Act of 1982 Hearings, 
supra note 141, at Part 1, pp. 551-52."
313,257," Although in theory the Yellow Pages would not be directly transferred to AT&T but would merely be made available to the 
highest bidder, it is clear that AT&T would in reality become the sole publisher of the Yellow Pages in the United States. Under 
the proposed decree AT&T will retain all of the personnel who have the experience in producing and marketing the Yellow 
Pages. Moreover, ingrained customer preferences being what they are, it would appear that, if the Operating Companies are not 
permitted to publish these directories, the only other widely-known telephone company (AT&T itself) will become the natural heir 
of this enterprise. This is so particularly since that company, with its financial resources, will inevitably be able to outbid anyone 
else who seriously considered entering this traditional Bell business. The parties do not dispute the conclusion that the business 
opportunities represented by the Yellow Pages would be transferred to AT&T. AT&T would hardly undertake to guarantee the 
Operating Companies' net revenue from the Yellow Pages if it did not expect to obtain the contract. See Defendants' Reply Brief 
at 35."
313,258," The large amount of information received by AT&T, combined with the economies of scale, would give it a natural and in all 
likelihood insuperable edge in the electronic Yellow Pages market."

313,262," Neither AT&T nor the Department of Justice has provided any assurance that this loss of revenue will not occur. AT&T's 
promise to guarantee the revenues from Yellow Pages for four years is only a short-range solution. The Department of Justice "
314,," has retreated from its earlier claims that the Operating Companies will receive equivalent revenues under its scheme for the 
production of Yellow Pages, and it is now apparently unable to predict the level of receipts. Response to Comments at 71-72."
314,263," The assets used in the production of these printed directories will accordingly have to be allocated to the Operating 
Companies. See Part IX infra."
314,264," If the restrictions were to continue in effect, their sole effect would be to limit competition by preventing the entry of a viable 
competitor."
314,265," This standard necessarily differs from the one governing the termination of the restrictions against AT&T's participation in the 
electronic publishing industry because different considerations are involved. See Part VI supra."
314,266," The test usually applied to a contested modification of a consent decree was set forth in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 
U.S. 106, 118, 76 L. Ed. 999, 52 S. Ct. 460 (1932). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the applicable standard was 
whether there were ""unforseen conditions"" that indicated the modification was appropriate. Some parties contend that a different 
standard may not be applied to the removal of the restrictions. However, there appears to be no reason why the decree itself 
cannot contain provisions governing the expiration of some of its restrictions."
314,267," Some interested persons, including the FCC, contend that the restriction limiting the divested Operating Companies to 
regulated natural monopoly activities is overbroad because these companies should only be barred from activities in which they 
may be able improperly to utilize their monopoly power in exchange telecommunications, and that these companies should be 
free to operate unrelated businesses (e.g., restaurants or department stores). A modification along these lines is not appropriate, 
if only because it would be extremely difficult to draw a comprehensive definition of the areas in which the Operating Companies' 
activities must be limited. Moreover, such a definition is unnecessary if the parties include in the proposed decree the Court's 
standard for the removal of restrictions on the activities of the divested Operating Companies. A divested Operating Company "
315,," which sought to engage in an unrelated industry could then petition the Court for removal of the restriction as it pertains to that 
industry, and if there was no realistic possibility of abuse of monopoly power, the Court could simply grant the petition."
315,268," These are the services which permit the origination or termination of an interexchange telephone call and similar transmission 
assistance for information services."
315,269," Several radio common carriers and owners of private communications systems contend that the equal access requirement 
should also apply to their interconnections with the Operating Companies instead of only to interconnection by the interexchange 
carriers and information services providers. The Court finds justified the parties' decision not to address these specialized 
demands. The access services required by these carriers are likely to differ from those needed by interexchange carriers and to differ also 
from carrier to carrier. For example, unlike interexchange carriers, owners of private systems are generally satisfied with their 
present interconnection arrangements (see Comments of Association of American Railroads at 8) but radio carriers wish their 
services to receive interconnection as would a Bell System Class 5 Switch (see Comments of Telocator Network of America at 
Appendix E). The decree could not establish all the various standards for interconnection for the large number of systems which 
seek access to the local networks of the divested Operating Companies. Nor is this necessary, for there is no support for the 
underlying premise of these carriers' contentions that the divested Operating Companies will have an incentive to alter the 
existing connecting arrangements for private systems. The question of proper interconnection of radio carriers has been 
addressed by the FCC and is currently before the Court of Appeals for this Circuit.  Cellular Communications Systems, 86 
F.C.C.2d 469 (1981), on reconsideration, 89 F.C.C.2d 58 (1982), appeal pending sub nom. Millicom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 81-1404 
(D.C. Cir.). For these reasons, the Court will not require the parties to modify the proposed decree specifically to address these 
concerns."
315,270," As is true with respect to all of the principles and promises underlying the decree, they acquire meaning only through 
implementation. The Department of Justice may be expected, in the first instance, to see to it that there is appropriate 
implementation but, as described in Part XI infra, the Court also intends to see to it that all these principles and premises are 
actually carried out. "
316,271," The divested Operating Companies must file tariffs for their access services. Revenues collected pursuant to these tariffs will 
substitute for funds currently received by the Operating Companies under the division of revenue process, which allocates 
interstate toll revenues between the operating companies and the Long Lines Division. See Proposed Decree at Appendix B(B). 
Tariffs for intrastate interexchange access services with the FCC. The proposed decree requires the Operating Companies to file 
tariffs which are cost-justified, but it does not limit the authority of the regulators to allocate costs pursuant to their regulatory 
policies. Thus, these tariffs may be set at a level which continues the current allocation of interexchange revenues. See also 
note 161 supra."
316,272," Testimony of Irwin Dorros (November 24, 1981). For similar reasons, the provision permitting the Operating Companies to 
seek Court permission not to provide equal access services where, as a result of technologically outdated switches ""such access 
is not physically feasible except at costs that clearly outweigh potential benefits to users of telecommunications services,"" is also 
a justifiable deviation from absolute equality. Proposed Decree, Appendix B(A)(3)."
316,273," The decree does not, however, preclude the Operating Companies from providing equal access more expeditiously if they are 
capable of doing so."
316,274, See Subpart B infra.
316,275," Both AT&T and the Department of Justice cite this Court's ruling during an earlier phase of the AT&T proceedings with regard 
to interconnection to AT&T's network that ""absolute equality of access to essential facilities . . . is not mandated by the antitrust 
laws."" United States v. AT&T, supra, 524 F. Supp. at 1360. The Court's statement has reference to the access necessary to 
avoid antitrust liability. It is not necessarily the appropriate standard for evaluating an antitrust remedy. A remedy must impose 
the requirements reasonably necessary to open the relevant markets to competition. See Part II supra."
316,276," Testimony of Bert C. Roberts, Jr. (April 27, 1981); Testimony of Jeffrey J. Kushan (May 1, 1981); Testimony of George 
Vasilakos (June 16, 1981). "
317,277," Proposed decree at Appendix B(A)(2). While the proposed decree states only that the ""minimum number of digits"" will be 
used, AT&T has indicated that fourteen digits will be required. See AT&T Reply Brief at 40."
317,278," Somewhat similar considerations apply to the facilities-sharing question. After divestiture, AT&T will necessarily share 
facilities with the Operating Companies because the physical components of the nationwide network cannot be neatly divided 
between them. It would be inappropriate to require, in the interest of symmetry, that the Operating Companies also to share 
facilities with the other interexchange carriers. This requirement would severely limit the Operating Companies' freedom to 
design their own networks and, as the number of carriers increases, such sharing could become physically impossible. The decree appropriately ameliorates AT&T's advantages resulting from sharing by requiring the Operating Companies' charges 
to other carriers to be equal to those charged to AT&T when that company's facility is close to an AT&T switch. See Appendix 
B(B)(3). This provision will remain in effect until 1991, by which time it is likely that AT&T's advantages will have been reduced 
by changes in the configuration of the local network. As to co-location in facilities constructed after divestiture, all carriers stand 
on the same footing: sharing is permitted, but not required."
317,279," To be sure, the Operating Companies may impose a charge for this routing option, but not only would the charge most likely 
be minimal but it would also be temporary. As stated above, as soon as the FCC decides to change the national numbering plan, 
the entire problem will be resolved."
317,280," An Operating Company would be free to provide billing services for more than one interexchange carrier; but it would not be 
required to do so."
317,281," The divested Operating Companies will have the obvious incentive to provide billing services to the interexchange carrier with 
the greatest volume of calls so as to obtain the largest possible reimbursement for billing services."
317,282," It could be as much as five dollars per month per subscriber. Testimony of Irwin Dorros (November 24, 1981). "
318,283," Testimony of Irwin Dorros (November 24, 1981)."
318,284," AT&T would be required to reimburse the Operating Companies for the cost of billing. Proposed Decree at Appendix B(C)(2). 
However, this amount would presumably be less than that required if AT&T were to provide its own billing."
318,285," The difference in cost is not likely to have a substantial effect on consumer choice for the high volume user which, for the 
present at least, appears to be the principal customer of AT&T's competitors."
318,286," AT&T states that lower costs could not be required because there was actually no difference in costs between the two types 
of access. See AT&T Reply Comments at 118. The Department of Justice contends that any such requirement would force the 
Court to value the diminished quality of access provided to AT&T's competitors. Department of Justice Brief at 35."
318,287," If there is no difference in the cost of providing these services, it would be appropriate for charges to AT&T to be increased to 
reflect its higher quality connection. The Court will not impose this requirement because it lacks the expertise and flexibility to 
determine the amount of such a premium, but regulators remain free to insist on such a differential. "
319,288," The alternative chosen by the Court avoids the problems raised by the parties. See note 286 supra. It requires that the 
Operating Companies file tariffs which reflect lower rates for interexchange carriers other than AT&T only to the extent that the 
costs for such access are lower than the cost of access provided to AT&T. The Operating Companies will not be required to 
provide access services at below-cost rates, and the Court will not have to place a monetary value on the lower quality service."
319,289," This matter is important because, in the view of the various intercity carriers, the Class Four switch provides the only gateway 
for toll quality transmission of interexchange traffic within the local exchange."
319,290," AT&T's Reply Comments at 107-08. According to AT&T, that division does not occur between the Class Four switching 
function and higher level switching functions but between the local end office (Class Five) function and the Class Four function. "
320,291, Section I(A)1.
320,292," Although under the proposed decree AT&T is not required to explain its procedures in this regard until it submits its plan of 
reorganization, it has announced this tentative proposal to inform the Court as well as other interested persons of its probable 
course of action."
320,293," The Court has concluded that the Operating Companies may produce printed directory advertising. See Part VII supra. 
Establishment of the directory advertising subsidiary may therefore be unnecessary because those assets will be retained by the 
Operating Companies."
320,294," At the time of the transfer of assets, the Operating Companies may also transfer a portion of their debt issue to the new 
subsidiaries or to AT&T."
320,295," This rule applies regardless of the direction in which the transfer occurs. A transfer of assets from a parent to a subsidiary is 
treated as a contribution to capital for which the subsidiary is not required to provide consideration to the parent. See, e.g., 
United States v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., 412 U.S. 401, 405-06, 37 L. Ed. 2d 30, 93 S. Ct. 2169 (1973); 
Abegg v. Commissioner, 429 F.2d 1209, 1215-18 (2d Cir. 1970). The transfer of assets from a subsidiary to a parent is treated 
as a distribution or dividend for which likewise no compensation is required. See, e.g., Prescott, Ball & Turben v. LTV Corp., 531 
F. Supp. 213, 214-15, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). Apparently the only limitation on these rules is that a transfer may not impair the 
rights of interested third parties, such as creditors. See, e.g., Superintendent of Insurance of New York v. Bankers Life & 
Casualty Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 30 L. Ed. 2d 128, 92 S. Ct. 165 (1971); Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 307, 84 L. Ed. 281, 60 S. 
Ct. 238 (1939); Hanraty v. Ostertag, 470 F.2d 1096, 1099 (10th Cir. 1972); Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. Grand Rapids 
G.H.& M. Ry. Co., 7 F. Supp. 511 (W.D. Mich. 1931), mod. on reh., 85 F.2d 331 (6th Cir. 1936). "
321,296," 267 F.2d at 719-20. The fact that Western Union ultimately decided to accomplish the divestiture through a sale rather than a 
spin-off (see Western Union Telegraph Co., 30 F.C.C. 323 (1961)) in no way undermines the Court of Appeals' general 
characterization of a spin-off as a compensation-free transfer."
321,297," Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding that holders of convertible debentures were not entitled to 
notice of the plan for reorganization, it did not in any way question the propriety of the corporate reorganization itself or the basic 
manner in which it was carried out."
321,298," See also, United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 358 F. Supp. 820 (D. Colo. 1972), aff'd, 410 U.S. 962, 35 L. Ed. 2d 
697, 93 S. Ct. 1440 (1973), where the court upheld a reorganization whereby El Paso transferred all of its pipeline assets at net 
book value to a newly-formed company in exchange for the new company's stock, then sold twenty percent of this stock, placed 
the remainder in a voting trust, and distributed participation certificates in the voting trust to El Paso shareholders, without any 
compensation between El Paso and the new company; and United States v. United Fruit Co., 1958 Trade Cas. para. 68,941 
(E.D. La. 1958), where the court ordered the defendant either (a) to create a new corporation capable of competing with the 
defendant and then to distribute the new company's stock to defendant's shareholders or (b) to sell sufficient assets to a third 
party in order that this third party could compete with the defendant."
321,299," The debt-equity ratio that is used by state regulators in calculating rates of return, for example, is not that for the individual 
Operating Company being directly regulated but rather the consolidated debt-equity ratio for the entire Bell System. The reason 
for this approach is clear: the regulators recognize that the debt ratio of each Operating Company is the result of AT&T's 
distribution of its debt and equity capital among the entities in the Bell System, and that the consolidated ratio is therefore a 
better reflection of the Operating Company's actual financial condition. As the New York Public Service Commission said: Using a consolidated capital structure is correct here because AT&T and its subsidiaries conduct their financings on a 
centralized, coordinated basis, which leaves largely to chance the market conditions prevailing when a particular subsidiary 
is scheduled to issue securities. New York Tel. Co., 23 P.U.R.4th 554, 562 (N.Y. Pub. Serv. Comm'n. 1977). See also, Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 10 
P.U.R.4th 211, 218 (Md. Pub. Serv. Comm'n. 1975); and New England Tel. & Tel. Co. 95 P.U.R.3d 71, 83 (N.H. Pub. Util. 
Comm'n. 1972). "

1973)."
322,301," Said the court (485 F.2d at 821): Transit's farepayers have long been saddled with the burdens incidental to the properties in issue while they remained in 
operating status. Theirs were the expenses of ordinary maintenance and depreciation, and the risks of loss from casualty 
and obsolescence, associated with those properties . . . . And Transit's investors have profited, not only from these 
arrangements of burdens, but also from favorable treatment of the operating assets in other ways. By our assessment, 
these circumstances tip the scale in favor of Transit's farepayers, so much as to earn for them the gains beyond the 
shadow of a doubt."
322,302," See also Bebchick v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, supra, 485 F.2d 858."
322,303," The FCC concurs in this position. It has advised the Court that ""implementation of the proposed decree will not inevitably 
produce any retirement from service"" of any of the Operating Companies' assets. Topic 4 Brief of FCC at 7. The proposed 
decree will not in any way disturb the authority of regulators to determine the proper valuation of assets regulated by their 
jurisdictions. For example, assets used to provide intrastate interexchange service will not be deregulated by the decree but will 
remain under regulation by the state commissions. These assets may simply be owned by a different corporate entity. It is irrelevant to these proceedings that certain assets, such as customer premises equipment, may in the future be removed 
from public service because of eventual deregulation under the FCC's Computer II decision or other regulatory action. If 
valuation problems arise as a result of the retirement of these assets from public service, they would arise at that time as a result 
of regulatory decisions; they would not stem from the proposed decree."
322,304," Treas. Reg. § 1.1002-1(c) (1956) HN32[
] holds that the underlying assumption in providing for tax-free reorganizations is 
that ""the new property is substantially a continuation of the old investment still unliquidated; and, in the case of reorganizations, 
that the new enterprise, the new corporate structure and the new property are substantially continuations of the old still 
unliquidated."" See, e.g., United States v. Adkins-Phelps, Inc., 400 F.2d 737, 740 (8th Cir. 1968); Commissioner v. Wilson, 353 "
323,," F.2d 184, 186 (9th Cir. 1965). This assumption obviously would not apply if AT&T were required to pay for the assets. The 
suggestion of some who object to the proposed decree that this tax liability could be avoided by an amendment of the current tax 
laws is entirely unpersuasive. The Court applies the laws as they now exist, not as they may some day be."
323,305," There is a serious question whether a compensation-free transfer could realistically be effected other than at net book value. 
Further, market valuation would probably entail a number of undesirable post-divestiture consequences (e.g., calculation of the 
rate base, taxation of the exchange)."
323,306," See, e.g., Application of Illinois Bell Tel. Co., Docket 78-0121 (Ill. Commerce Comn., April 19, 1978) (sale of Illinois Bell 
switching equipment to AT&T at net book); Application of Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., Docket 3999 (Tex. Publ. Utils. Comn., 
Nov. 13, 1977) (sale by Mountain Bell of plant to Southwestern); Re Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., Docket No. U-F-2286, 39 P.U.R.3d 
132, 135-36 (Oregon Pub. Utils. Comn. 1961)."
323,307, It is computed simply by using the original cost and depreciation.
323,308," See, e.g., Re Southern New England Tel. Co., Docket No. 10054, 42 P.U.R.3d 310, 320 (Conn. Pub. Utils. Comn. 1962); Re 
New York Tel. Co., 91 P.U.R. (n.s.) 231, 257 (N. Y. Pub. Serv. Comn. 1951). Moreover, HN33[
] in a regulated firm, there is 
the additional problem of an interdependence between rates and market value. Specifically, the market value of an asset 
depends upon the revenue it generates, but in a regulated industry the amount of revenue is dependent on the level of rates set 
by regulators. As stated by the Supreme Court in FPC v. Hope Natural Gas, supra, 320 U.S. at 601: The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon ""fair value"" when the value of the going enterprise 
depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated. "
324,309," The Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 mandates the transfer of assets from the estates of certain bankrupt railroads 
to the newly formed Conrail Corporation, and a Special Court was appointed to determine the value of the transferred assets.  
45 U.S.C. §§ 743, 746. Despite the fact that the valuation proceedings for these assets began in the mid-1970s, they have yet to 
be completed. Indeed, the almost insuperable obstacles surrounding such proceedings led Judge Friendly to observe in 1977: . . . we would be remiss if we did not advise the parties and also the lawmakers of our fears as to the length and cost of 
these proceedings if they are carried to a conclusion under the charter that has been given us, even with the simplifying 
limitations we have here imposed. Nearly four years have elapsed since the Rail Act was adopted and a year and a half 
have gone by since the conveyances. Yet despite earnest sincere efforts by all concerned, we are only at the start of the 
valuation problem. Matter of the Valuation Proceedings under Sections 303(c) and 306 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 445 F. 
Supp. 994, 1045 (Sp. Ct. 1977). Despite the fact that over eighty percent of the case was settled by the parties, the Special 
Court concluded the rail-use phase of the valuation proceedings with the issuance of its 200 page opinion only in late 1981. See 
Matter of the Valuation Proceedings, 531 F. Supp. 1191 (Sp. Ct. 1981). The nonrail-use phase of the proceedings has only 
begun: opening briefs will not be filed until October 2, 1982, and oral argument is not scheduled until January 4, 1983. Matter of 
the Valuation Proceedings, Misc. No. 76-1, Order (Sp. Ct. July 6, 1982)."
324,310," Thus, the suggestion by some that the valuation process could be completed within six months (see Topic 4 Brief of People of 
California, et al., at 35) is wholly unrealistic; and those who make these proposals are ultimately driven to the conclusion that the 
entire divestiture must be abandoned as impractical. Reply Brief of People of California et al. at 9."
324,311," The suggestion that the pitfalls of the Conrail case could somehow be avoided by allowing the state regulatory bodies to 
value the assets may readily be rejected. To permit forty-nine different forums to conduct forty-nine different proceedings would 
only exacerbate, not diminish, the problems."
324,312," This decision of course in no way affects the authority of regulators to use a different standard in valuing assets within their 
jurisdiction for ratemaking purposes. "
325,313, Section I(A)2.
325,314, Department of Justice Brief at 60.
325,315," AT&T Brief at 88; AT&T Reply Brief at 92. AT&T acknowledges only that predominant use will be ""a major criterion"" in 
allocating ownership of the assets. Reply Brief at 92. "
326,316," When this test is coupled with the provision allowing for cost-based leasing, it will assist in the division of multifunction 
facilities in a manner that is fair to both AT&T and the Operating Companies. Section I(A)2."
326,317," The required modification will provide the necessary flexibility in the event it is determined that in certain instances the 
predominant use test is inappropriate. See Part XII infra."
326,318," AT&T has stated that it will do so either by assuming a proportion of each debt issue or by assuming all of certain debt issues 
that have appropriate rates and maturities. See AT&T Reply Comments at 76-80; AT&T Brief at 90; AT&T Reply Brief at 95-96."
326,319," These persons have proposed different alternatives: some contend that no Operating Company should have a debt ratio over 
50 percent; others that the Operating Companies should be spun off with the same debt ratio they had before divestiture; still 
others argue that, regardless of what ratio is chosen, it should be the same for all the Operating Companies so as to ensure that 
after divestiture they will have equal opportunities to attract new financing."
326,320," Pacific Telephone currently has a substantially higher debt-equity ratio (at about 57 percent) due in large part to the actions of 
California's regulators. The Court will not require AT&T to reduce Pacific Telephone's debt to 45 percent, but will accept a 
reduction of Pacific's debt to around 50 percent. This 50 percent ratio appears to be acceptable to the State of California. See 
Topic 4 Brief of the State of California at 38."
326,321," In actual practice, there may be a distinction between the Department of Justice's proposal regarding the quality of the debt 
and that of AT&T. The Court expects that the plan of reorganization will provide each Operating Company with a debt portfolio 
that reflects the terms and conditions comparable to the debt held by the Bell System as a whole unless it can be shown that, 
with respect to a particular Operating Company, its own current debt provides a more equitable basis. In the event of a dispute, 
the chief executives of the new regional Operating Companies may be heard regarding this subject. "
327,322," Thus, the Department states that the features of the integrated Bell System ""have led us to express our view that divestiture 
of major components of the Bell System particularly structural separation between the local exchange and interexchange 
functions, would adversely impact system integrity and the Bell System's current ability to promptly provide emergency 
communications support and restoration."" Department of Defense Comments at 16; see also, id. at 24."
327,323," E.g., Secretary of Defense Harold Brown (December 17, 1981); former Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard 
(November 6, 1981); Gerald P. Dineen, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (December 16, 
1981); and former Air Force general Lee M. Paschall (November 6, 1981). All these individuals were called as witnesses on 
behalf of AT&T."
327,324," See, e.g., the trial testimony of Dr. Dineen at Tr. 24538-39; General Paschall at Tr. 19699-711. Bell Laboratories continues to 
be an important supplier of sophisticated equipment to the Defense Department; however, the divestiture does not disturb its 
relationship to AT&T."
327,325," E.g., whether such concepts as ""emergency"" and ""customer premises"" are adequately defined."
327,326," The proposed decree provides (in Section I(C)) that until 1987, AT&T shall provide research and development services to the 
Operating Companies on a priority basis, while under the Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C.A. App. § 2061 et seq., priorities "
328,," may be assigned to contracts necessary or appropriate to the national defense. There is no reason why AT&T cannot satisfy 
both requirements."
328,327," The Department complains (Comments at 27-31) that interexchange carriers, but not customers of telecommunications 
carriers, are given the benefit of the provisions which prohibit the Operating Companies from discriminating in providing access. 
The proposed decree addresses a real problem: that the Operating Companies, because of their past ties to AT&T, might give 
special consideration to their former parent. It is difficult to believe that the Operating Companies would have an incentive to 
discriminate against their customers, particularly large customers such as the United States government."
328,328," A fourth recommendation is that AT&T be authorized and required to participate in the planning, administration, and operation 
of this ""single point of contact"" or any centralized administrative entity the Operating Companies may establish. The proposed 
decree quite properly rejects that concept since it would be antithetical to the basic theory and purpose of the decree. Similarly 
unacceptable, and for the same reasons, is the Defense Department's request that the Operating Companies be permitted to 
engage in coordination beyond the needs of national security and emergency preparedness."
328,329," Since the subjects covered in this section of the opinion concern intra-governmental matters, the Court assumes that 
accommodations can be worked out between the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense without the need for 
specific modifications of the decree. However, the Department of Defense will be afforded an opportunity, following the 
submission of the reorganization plan, to submit further comments to the Court, should it be dissatisfied with the arrangements 
made by AT&T and the Department of Justice."
328,330," This labor union represents over 500,000 employees of the Bell System, or 51 percent of all of the System's employees, in 
addition to over 70,000 employees in other telecommunications companies."
328,331," This was done in anticipation of the establishment of separate subsidiaries or affiliated entities, presumably by requirement of 
the FCC."
328,332," These include the preservation of wages and net credited service of transferred employees for five years after the transfer; no 
reduction of pension, health, or other benefits as a result of the transfer; payment of reasonable travel and moving expenses for 
transferred employees; continued application of the collective bargaining agreement to these employees; preferential rehiring 
rights; advance notice to the union of any work group transfer; and continued recognition by the subsidiaries or affiliates of the 
Communications Workers of America as the exclusive bargaining representative of transferred employees. "
329,333," Obviously, the divested Operating Companies and other successor AT&T entities may subsequently negotiate superseding 
collective bargaining agreements with the majority representatives of their employees."
329,334, The statute goes on to provide that it does not apply to consent judgments entered before any testimony is taken.
329,335," Other parties suggest that the Court should not enter the judgment without first making specific findings that might be used by 
private parties in subsequent litigation. There is no warrant for such findings. Although the vast majority of the evidence has 
been adduced, the trial has not been concluded, and the Court would therefore not be justified -- absent a waiver by the parties 
or their refusal to produce additional evidence -- to make findings of fact. See, e.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe 
Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968); Emich v. General Motors Corp., 340 U.S. 558, 566-

Response to Comments at 134-36. "
330,337," Likewise, nothing in this opinion is intended to constitute a finding of violation of the antitrust laws. "
331,338," See United States v. AT&T, 524 F. Supp. at 1357-60."
331,339," Cincinnati Bell is covered by the proposed decree notwithstanding the fact that it is not one of the twenty-two Operating 
Companies to be divested because Section I(A)(3) of the proposed decree calls for ""the termination of the License Contracts 
between AT&T and the BOCs and other subsidiaries."" Section IV of the proposed decree, in turn, defines subsidiary as ""any 
organization or entity in which AT&T has stock ownership, whether or not controlled by AT&T."" Thus, these provisions include 
Cincinnati Bell as well as the Southern New England Telephone Company."
331,340, The minutes of a Board of Directors meeting are alleged to substantiate their claim.
331,341, There is some question whether the stock was worth $70 million or about one-half that amount.

332,343, AT&T Reply Comments at 3.
332,344," This limitation is without prejudice to the exercise by the Court of authority to modify the judgment stemming not from the 
decree itself but from general principles of law."
332,345," For example, section IV(G)(1) provides that the local exchange areas shall be drawn in such a way as to take account of 
""common social, economic, and other purposes, even where such configuration transcends municipal or other local 
governmental boundaries."" It is nowhere spelled out what those conditions might be, or how they would be established, defined, 
or demonstrated. AT&T would thus be wholly free to draw the exchange area boundaries so as to further its own interests at the 
expense of those of the Operating Companies, at the expense of its various interexchange competitors, or both. "
333,," Similarly, section I(A)(1) provides that ""sufficient facilities, personnel, systems, and rights to technical information"" will be 
assigned by AT&T to the Operating Companies so as to permit them effectively to perform the functions assigned to them under 
the judgment. This clause, too, is more precatory than mandatory, more broad than precise, and in particular it leaves to AT&T 
wide discretion in the assignment and the configuration of common facilities. As indicated in Part IX, supra, the multifunction 
facilities represent, by the parties' own estimates, about twenty percent of the total Bell System assets -- meaning that they have 
a value of some $20 billion. Unless more definite guidelines are set, there is an obvious and substantial incentive and 
opportunity for manipulation by AT&T."
333,346," Among these principles are the following: (1) AT&T will grant to the Operating Companies on a royalty-free basis all existing 
patents and all patents to be issued for a period of five years following entry of the judgment; (2) the chief executives of the 
seven new Operating Companies will have full independence, without interference, from AT&T to provide to the Court their views 
regarding the plan of reorganization and otherwise; (3) switches providing Class Four functions will be available for the 
interconnection of AT&T's interexchange competitors if the Operating Companies conclude that this is the most efficient method 
of effecting the interconnection; (4) the ""single point of contact,"" organized to meet national security and emergency 
preparedness needs will be sufficiently funded and supported; and (5) the local exchange areas will be drawn in accordance with 
objective principles and without discrimination."
333,347," AT&T Reply Brief at 132, note **."
333,348," Department of Justice Brief at 96-99. But the Department has acknowledged that the Court has a legitimate interest in 
retaining jurisdiction to assure that the plan of reorganization does not depart from the principles in the judgment. See slip op. at 
159-60 infra."
333,349," Individuals, of course, come and go. What has remained and is likely to remain constant are AT&T's self-interest and its 
desire to secure from government officials favorable interpretations of laws, rules, regulations, agreements, and understandings; 
and the possibility that political or other influence may effectively be brought to bear on public officials. "

334,351, See Part II supra.
334,352," The parties contend that in other cases courts have been content with less than what they have presented here, and that 
these courts have not required approval of detailed implementation plans. In fact, HN38[
] consent decrees commonly include 
clauses requiring judicial approval of plans of reorganization. See, e.g., United States v. American Optical Co., 1966 Trade Cas. 
para. 71,781 (E.D. Wis. 1966); United States v. United Fruit Co., 1958 Trade Cas. para. 68,941 (E.D. La. 1958)."
334,353," For example, AT&T and its affiliates are required under Section I(C) of the proposed decree to provide research, 
development, manufacturing, and other support services to the Operating Companies; and pursuant to Appendix B of the 
proposed decree, the equal exchange access for all interexchange carriers must be provided by September 1, 1986. "
335,354," Section VII of the proposed decree provides that jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to this Modification of Final Judgment, or, 
after the reorganization specified in Section I, a BOC to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders or directions 
as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this Modification of Final Judgment, for the 
modification of any of the provisions hereof, for the enforcement of compliance herewith, and for the punishment of any 
violation hereof."

335,357," Competitive Impact Statement at 17. To confuse the parties' positions even further, counsel for the Department suggested 
during oral argument that under the decree the Court could act on its own motion, but only in the event that the Department had 
failed in bad faith to undertake its own enforcement efforts. Hearing on June 30, 1982, Tr. 25445-47."
335,358," It may be that, in a case of this kind, where the Court has in effect placed its imprimatur on the decree by virtue of a 
comprehensive public interest proceeding, it would be a party in interest with sufficient standing for civil contempt purposes. It is 
not necessary to come to a definite conclusion on this matter at this time. "
336,359, See notes 60-61 supra.
336,360," Specifically, the Court's memorandum stated that Interested persons shall indicate (1) whether they request participation as intervenors, amicus curiae, or in some other 
capacity; (2) whether such status would be limited to certain topics or phases of the proceedings; (3) what specific powers 
they would expect to be able to exercise (e.g., present evidence, file procedural motions or counterclaims, take appeals, 
acquire the right to veto the settlement); and (4) why such status and such powers are necessary for the safeguarding of 
their legitimate interests and appropriate in the circumstances of this case [citing a previous Court memorandum]. Order filed May 25, 1982, at 5."
336,361," No one asserted a sufficient reason for receiving a right to veto the settlement. There was little response to the Court's inquiry 
as to the need for intervention or its appropriateness in the circumstances of these cases."
336,362," There are no court decisions holding that the Tunney Act grants a right to intervene. Decisional law prior to passage of the 
Act is generally to the same effect. One exception is Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 17 
L. Ed. 2d 814, 87 S. Ct. 932 (1967), but it involved a unique fact situation. The Supreme Court had ordered divestiture as part of 
its decision on the merits but no action had been taken to carry out the mandate. Instead, the parties filed a consent decree 
which did ""the opposite of what [the Court's] prior opinion and mandate commanded."" Id. at 142. In that posture, the Court found 
a right to intervene. The cases are virtually unanimous in limiting the Cascade decision to its peculiar facts. For example when a 
third party sought to intervene in the Western Electric case, the court denied the application, finding Cascade to be limited to its 
""extraordinary circumstances,"" and that decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.  United States v. Western Electric Co.,

consuming means) (Judge J. Skelly Wright)."
337,364," Intervenor status would not be appropriate simply in the abstract. As indicted supra, the Tunney Act does not require the full 
formalities extant in normal litigation unless they are needed for the development of information useful to the public interest

339,373," The Operating Companies own most of the facilities necessary for the provision of interexchange service. See Exhibit D-24B-
1011. The functioning of AT&T's Long Lines Department would be substantially impaired if the Operating Companies were 
divested intact."
339,374," Much of the impetus for an immediate spin-off results from the belief that there should be arm's length bargaining regarding 
the valuation of the assets being divided between AT&T and the Operating Companies. That argument in favor of an immediate 
spin-off is meritless, however, because the Court has concluded that net book value rather than market value is the appropriate 
standard for this division. See Part IX supra. "
340,375," In order to enable the Court to assess the weight to be accorded to the statements of these individuals, they will also be 
invited, but not required, to reveal any continuing relationship they may have with AT&T (i.e., reemployment rights, pension 
plans, informal promises of executive position with AT&T). "
342,376," The decree also provides for another method of subsidizing these rates. It permits the Operating Companies, under the 
supervision of state and federal regulators, to levy access charges upon long distance carriers and those companies that provide 
information services. These charges may, if the regulators desire, be set at levels which will subsidize for local telephone rates. "

'N' follows paragraph 'L'.This omission was simply an error in alphabetizing and does not reflect a substantive omission.  
Because these and subsequent paragraphs have been referred to in various pleadings filed with the Court, correction of this 
error in the revised decree might cause confusion in the future.  The parties, therefore, have not changed Section IV to correct 
this typographical erro."" (From Memorandum of the United States, August 24, 1982, which accompanied submission of the

372,3," Testimony at the hearing on this point was not entirely clear.See Tr. at 361-62, 626-27, 636 & 643."
372,4," The 1980 losses were actually reported as $1,896,000 on total sales of $8,904,000, for a pretax loss of 21.3%.  (ATI Ex. #1; 
Marathon Ex. #9, C-1). "
373,5," Under the terms of Spiegel's severence contract with ATI/Papercraft, he could not compete against ATI until January of 1982, 
but he was free to conduct negotiations. (Tr. at 184)."
373,6," Mr. Ray Seegmiller, executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Marathon, noted some of the major difficulties with 
the letter of intent in his testimony at the hearing, as follows: ""[T]here were conditions on the price that would be paid….  It could be lowered or raised, based on the market value of the 
inventory that was going to be acquired.  Arriving at the market value, as far as I was concerned, could be a big area of dispute."" ""The next point which I felt was a major point is that Mr. Spiegel wanted to use the trademarks and patents of Marathon.  In my 
opinion, that was something we did not do [because of potential liability]."" ""Along the same lines, Mr. Spiegel had waited so long to make us an offer that he wanted to use our advertising material.  This 
advertising material had our name on it, it had our trademark on it.  He wanted to see our financial records.  There was no need 
for him to see our financial records if we were selling assets other than as I say on here, a customer list to know who the 
customers were, and the list of the equipment. ""He wanted… a five-year lease on the manufacturing plant which we were currently manufacturing -- or manufactured trees in.  
And by this time we had had plans for this building to be used in the manufacture of blinds."" ""[H]e talked about pension plans.  We have no intention of telling Mr. Spiegel anything about our pension plan.  If we sold the 
assets where-is, as-is, we would take care of our people."" ""Lastly, the major point… they would draft the agreement which would inlude customer representations and warranties.  I had 
said from the very beginning that we were selling assets where-is, as-is, we were making no representations, no warranties."" (Tr. 
at 157-59). "
374,7," Although Spiegel's second offer, or ""letter of intent,"" was received by mr. Schilling around the 30th of January, it took several 
days for the letter to be transmitted to legal counsel at Marathon's headquarters and to Mr. Seegmiller, for their negative reaction 
to be relayed back to Mr. Schilling, and for Schilling to convey the rejection to Spiegel.  Even after a negative reply was received, 
Mr. Schilling continued to cooperate with Mr. Spiegel in his efforts to purchase the business because it appeared that he had 
finally obtained financial backing.  Mr. Schilling felt that if the money difficulties were resolved, then the details of the deal might 
still be worked out.  (Tr. at 192-96)."
374,8," At the end of the 1981 season, production ceased at Carey-McFall's plants in Texas and Georgia.  (Marathon Ex. #9 at 5-7)."
374,9," Approximately 100 sample trees were produced at the Pennsylvania factory.  Normal productive capacity was approximately 
600,000 artificial trees per season. (Marathon Ex. #9 at 6; Tr. at 17)."
374,10," At this time, Mr. Schilling expressed concern over the costs Carey-McFall was incurring by refurbishing equipment, preparing 
for the Toy Fair, and maintaining an experienced work force, in order to permit a smooth transfer of the operations.  Spiegel 
agreed to assume Carey-McFall's expenses, including salaries, in connection with the Toy Fair.  (Tr. at 196-97). "
375,11," Mr. Shaffer was aware that Mr. Spiegel was a possible buyer of the company, but it was anticipated that Mr. Shaffer would be 
retained by Spiegel as plant manager.  The need to conceal Mr. Spiegel's identity and intentions, therefore, was not present, at 
least as far as Mr. Shaffer was concerned.  (Tr. at 224-26)."
375,12," The memoranda were dated February 10, 1982, and February 11, 1982, on which dates Mr. Marshall Katz was en route to 
New York.Consequently, Mr. Katz did not read these memoranda until after the agreement was concluded on February 12, 
1982.  (Tr. at 448 & 464; Government Ex. ##12 & 13). "
376,13," Paragraph 6 of the Agreement specifies that ""closing time"" is the date which is ten (10) days earlier than the ""closing date"".The 
""closing date"" is that date which is designated by Papercraft but which is not earlier than fifteen (15) days nor later than thirty 
(30) days after counsel for Papercraft have advised that the condition set forth in Paragraph 4 has been satisfied. Prior to the hearing, Marathon had disposed of raw material inventories having a book value of approximately $400,000.  (Tr. at 
330)."
376,14," As of January 20, 1982, the book value of Marathon's finished goods inventory was $543,039.  (Government Ex. #1, Schedule 
I). "
377,15," Marathon ranked the three options as follows; first, Papercraft's offer; second, liquidation; and third, Mr. Speigel's offer.  (Tr. at 
295-296)."
377,16," Paragraph 3 states, in pertinent part: ""Between the date hereof [of the Agreement] and the Closing Date, Seller will maintain such machinery and equipment in its 
present condition, normal wear and tear only accepted, and Papercraft shall have the right to inspect such machinery and 
equipment at reasonable times during Seller's business hours upon reasonable prior notice."" "
381,17," Had we not found that an acquisition of assets did not take place, this court might have been prompted by the imprecision and 
ambiguity of Section V(D) to hold that Respondents' conduct was not contemptuous solely on that ground.  See United States v. 
Christie Industries, Inc., 465 F. 2d 1002, 1006 (3d Cir. 1972); Ford v. Kammerer, 450 F. 2d 279, 289 (3d Cir. 1971)."
381,18," This particular proviso of Section V(D) was designed, we believe, to allow ATI/Papercraft to meet its machinery requirements 
by purchasing machinery from other artificial Christmas tree manufacturers. Since the equipment generally cannot be purchased 
on the open market, artificial Christmas tree manufacturers either build the equipment themselves or buy it from other tree 
manufacturers."
381,19," Under the Agreement, Marathon has been free at all times to sell raw materials and work-in-process.  Prior to the hearing, 
they had sold or converted raw materials having a book value of approximately $400,000.  Marathon has been free to sell 
finished goods since May 12, 1982.  In addition, the record indicates that the amount of the finished goods inventory was not 
large enough to have a significant impact on the market.  See note 14 supra. "

denied, 423 U.S. 1050, 96 S. Ct. 777, 46 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1976). Spencer Cos. v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., [Current Transfer Binder] Fed. S. L. Rep. (CCH) P 98,361 (D. Mass. 1981), seems to 
require infiltration of a legitimate business enterprise.  The opinion does not explicitly set forth a standing requirement because, 
on the facts of that case, it was apparent that plaintiffs' injuries stemmed directly from defendants' infiltration through a pattern of

395,6," The amended decree states in relevant part that ASCAP is: (B) Ordered and directed to issue to any unlicensed radio or television broadcaster, upon written request, per program 
licenses, the fee for which (1) in the case of commercial programs, is, at the option of ASCAP, either (a) expressed in terms of dollars, requiring the 
payment of a specified amount for each program in which compositions in the ASCAP repertory shall be performed, or (b) 
based upon the payment of a percentage of the sum paid by the sponsor of such program for the use of the broadcasting or 
telecasting facilities of such radio or television broadcaster, (2) in the case of sustaining programs, is at the option of ASCAP, either (a) expressed in terms of dollars, requiring the 
payment of a specified amount for each program in which compositions in the ASCAP repertory shall be performed, or (b) 
based upon the payment of a percentage of the card rate which would have been applicable for the use of its broadcasting 
facilities in connection with such program if it had been commercial, and (3) subject to the other provisions of Section VIII, takes into consideration the economic requirements and situation of 
those stations having relatively few commercial announcements and a relatively greater percentage of sustaining programs, 
with the objective that such stations shall have a genuine economic choice between per program and blanket licenses; (C) Enjoined and restrained from requiring or influencing the prospective licensee to negotiate for a blanket license prior to 
negotiating for a per program license. VIII.  Defendant ASCAP, in fixing its fees for the licensing of compositions in the ASCAP repertory, is hereby ordered and 
directed to use its best efforts to avoid any discrimination among the respective fees fixed for the various types of licenses 
which would deprive the licensees or prospective licensees of a genuine choice from among such various types of licenses. IX. (A) Defendant ASCAP shall, upon receipt of a written application for a license for the right of public performance of any, 
some or all of the compositions in the ASCAP repertory, advise the applicant in writing of the fee which it deems reasonable 
for the license requested.  If the parties are unable to agree upon a reasonable fee within sixty (60) days from the date 
when such application is received by ASCAP, the applicant therefor may forthwith apply to this Court for the determination 
of a reasonable fee and ASCAP shall, upon receipt of notice of the filing of such application, promptly give notice thereof to 
the Attorney General.  In any such proceeding the burden of proof shall be on ASCAP to establish the reasonableness of 
the fee requested by it.  Pending the completion of any such negotiations or proceedings, the applicant shall have the right 
to use any, some or all of the compositions in the ASCAP repertory to which its application pertains, without payment of any 
fee or other compensation, but subject to the provisions of Sub-section (B) hereof, and to the final order or judgment 
entered by this Court in such proceeding . . . ."""
395,7," As is well-known, there are three national television networks owned by CBS, the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and the 
American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.  Each owns and operates five television stations in five of the top fifteen television "
396,," markets in the United States and has 200 affiliated local stations which use network programming for a substantial portion of 
their broadcast day."
396,8, See note 16 infra.
396,9," Defendants emphasize that, spurred by the increased use by syndicators of satellite distribution, in recent years there has been 
an increase in the number of syndicated programs broadcast live or on the same day they are produced.  The amount of such 
programming remains insignificant."
396,10," Defendants stress that, due to the FCC's Prime Time Access Rule barring network stations from broadcasting off-network 
syndicated programs during prime time, even in New York, the nation's largest television market, there are only three VHF local 
commercial stations competing for syndicated programs to be shown during prime time.  The existence of three potential buyers 
competing at any given time for a single product does not, to this court's view, undermine the finding below that competition 
among local stations for desirable syndicated programming is ""vigorous."" "
397,11," This testimony was provided by: Lesley G. Arries of Buffalo Broadcasting Co., Inc.; James A. Stabile and Alfred L. Schwartz of 
Metromedia; Milford N. (Buddy) Bostick of KWTX-TV in Waco, Texas; Abiah A. Church of Storer Broadcasting Co.; J. Allen 
Jensen of KID-TV in Idaho; and George Willoughby of King Broadcasting Co. in Seattle.  Defendants did not, in order to rebut 
the testimony, produce as witnesses at trial any of those syndicators who defendants assert deal with local television stations 
from weak bargaining positions."
397,12," The court is cognizant of the fact that, as defendants emphasize, many owners of local television stations own stations in more 
than one market.  That fact does not alter the court's conclusion that local television stations lack bargaining power over 
distributors of desirable syndicated programming for the reason that individual stations, even though commonly owned, do not 
generally engage in ""group buying"" of syndicated programs."
397,13," These companies are: Viacom Enterprises, MCA/Universal, Columbia Pictures Television, Paramount Television Distribution, 
Warner Bros. Television Distribution, United Artists Television, Inc., Twentieth-Century Fox Television and MGM Television. 
These eight companies also control a sizable but smaller proportion of the production market of syndicated programming."
397,14," Defendants assert that the number of first-run syndicated programs being broadcast which regularly contain substantial 
amounts of feature music has increased since 1971.  The increase does not yet appear significant. "
398,15," Exceptions include live local concerts, parades, football games and ethnic or religious programs."
398,16," Music in the network programming broadcast by local television stations is covered by blanket licenses obtained by the 
networks from ASCAP and BMI and is paid for directly to the networks by local stations. Thus, the individual local television 
stations do not need to obtain additional music licenses in order to broadcast network programming."
398,17," There does exist a third performing rights organization in the United States, SESAC, Inc. (""SESAC""), which also issues blanket 
licenses to many local television stations. SESAC's repertory is insignificant compared to that of either ASCAP or BMI."
398,18," Licensing ""at the source"" (or ""source licensing"") refers to the practice by which producers themselves obtain the performing 
rights to the music contained in their programs and then pass along these rights together with the program packages to 
television stations (usually via distributors).  Music may be licensed at the source by producers in either composer-for-hire or 
pre-existing music situations."
398,19," The amount which local television stations pay ASCAP and BMI for their blanket licenses, although substantial, is but a small 
fraction of the stations' revenues.  In 1980, local television stations paid $36.7 million in fees to ASCAP and $20.1 million to BMI.  
The networks, by contrast, in 1980 paid $15.2 million to ASCAP, and $7.8 million to BMI. "
399,20," HN1[
] The Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., recognizes the synchronization right as a distinct right exclusively exploitable by the copyright holder.  Whereas a performing rights license is required each time a user, such as a 
local station, broadcasts a program in which copyrighted music is incorporated, a synchronization license is a one-time only 
license. Television synchronization license fees are usually between $150 and $500."
399,21," Under these composer-for-hire agreements, producers obtain television performing rights under the condition that the 
producers register the music with ASCAP or BMI publishing subsidiaries and then grant back a portion of the performing rights to 
the composers, all pursuant to the understanding that the producers will not assign the television performing rights in any 
manner which would abrogate or otherwise affect the composers' right to collect the writers' shares of the performing rights 
royalties to be distributed by ASCAP and BMI.  The provisions outlined above reflect several elements of the industry-wide 
agreements negotiated in the 1960's between the Composers and Lyricists Guild of America and the Association of Motion 
Picture and Television Producers. Defendants assert that producers somehow emerge from this contractual labyrinth with the 
ability to license music performing rights directly to anyone.  It is nonetheless clear that producers possess no such capacity 
(unless the capacity to which defendants refer is that of the producers' affiliated publishing interests to license the music directly 
to television stations).  It was apparent throughout four weeks of testimony regarding the industry that under the present system 
there is no source licensing and that syndicators could not merely convey performing rights without engaging in any additional 
negotiations with composers or publishing companies.  If further substantiation is needed, it is provided by the responses of 
syndicators to plaintiffs' requests for source licensing in which several syndicators stated that to fulfill plaintiffs' requests they 
would have to return to the publishers and composers and enter into new negotiations in order to secure television performing 
rights. "
400,22," Should producers and composers negotiate with regard to the licensing of television performing rights in addition to the other 
rights, there would be little, if any, added complexity to these composer-for-hire negotiations."
400,23," The publisher in this situation is analogous to the composer in the composer-for-hire situation; there appears to be no question 
that the publisher could, should he be so requested and so inclined, grant a performing rights license to the producer."
400,24," The reason for the absence of ""splitting"" in the licensing of music in theatrical motion pictures is that the practice was held 
unlawful under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in Alden-Rochelle, Inc. v. ASCAP, 80 F. Supp. 888 (S.D.N.Y. 1948), relief, 
80 F. Supp. 900 (S.D.N.Y. 1948)."
400,25," The court is unable, on the basis of the disputed facts and figures presented, further to specify the extent of the producers' and 
distributors' affiliated interests in ASCAP and BMI."
400,26," There is, of course, no indication that it is because of the blanket licensing system that only a few composers earn royalties 
attributable to performance of their compositions on local television station broadcasts. It may well be that in a source licensing 
system featured by price competition among composers these same composers would control the market. "
401,27," That section provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."""
401,28," Plaintiffs' claim of copyright misuse is tangential to the focal antitrust claim and is mentioned only briefly below.  See note 45 
infra. The complaint also asserts claims that defendants monopolized the market for the licensing of performing rights to local 
television stations in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, and that the blanket licensing system constitutes 
an illegal tying arrangement in violation of Section 1.  These claims were unmentioned both during the four-week trial and in the 
parties' very extensive pre-trial and post-trial papers. The court accordingly regards the claims as abandoned and shall not 
consider them."
401,29," The complaint additionally seeks treble damages.  In this bifurcated trial, the issue of liability was tried first with the issue of 
damages reserved pending decision on the issue of liability."
401,30," It appears that by the term ""direct licensing"" the district court meant both direct and source licensing as defined in this opinion.  
See 400 F. Supp. at 759-60, 768, 778."
401,31," As the district court stated: ""CBS is far more than a television network. It is, as Michael Dann, former Senior Vice President of 
CBS in charge of programming testified, 'The No. 1 outlet in the history of entertainment' and 'the giant of the world in the use of 
music rights.'"" 400 F. Supp. at 770. "
402,32," Recently, in F.E.L. Publications, Ltd. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 1982 1 TRADE CASES P 64,632 (7th Cir. March 25, 
1982), the Seventh Circuit adopted a standard of availability which appears similar to that advanced here.  In rejecting a 
challenge to the blanket license offered by a single publisher of religious music to Roman Catholic parishes in the Chicago area 
due to the availability of marketing alternatives, the Court of Appeals stated: ""Although inconvenience or expense may in some 
cases be barriers to the availability of alternatives, in this case we believe these factors are not so obstructive that they 
constitute legal impediments to [the] alternatives."" Id. at 73,466.  Specifically, the Seventh Circuit held that an alternative license 
offered by the same publisher was a realistically available and adequate alternative despite the fact that, unlike the challenged 
blanket license, the alternative would permit a church to use each song only one time and thus prohibit inclusion in custommade 
hymnals.  To the extent that the holding in F.E.L. Publications is inconsistent with the standard advanced here, the court finds 
F.E.L. Publications distinguishable by virtue of the fact that, in sharp contrast to the instant case, at issue there were the 
licensing practices of a single publisher in a comparatively miniscule market with substantially reduced capacity to offer licensing 
alternatives. "
403,33, See note 24 and accompanying text supra.
403,34," United States v. ASCAP (Application of Voice of Alabama, Inc.)."
403,35," United States v. ASCAP (Application of Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting, Inc.), 331 F.2d 117 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 
997, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1048, 84 S. Ct. 1917 (1964). "
404,36," [***149]  The court's conclusion with regard to the per program license is not at odds with that of the district court in CBS v. 
ASCAP, 400 F. Supp. at 778-79. The court in CBS cited the per program license as a feasible changeover mechanism in view of 
(1) the per program license's carve-out provision for programs containing only music licensed at the source, and (2) CBS' 
concession ""that it could license the music for most of its entertainment programs without difficulty by requiring the program 
packager to deliver performance rights together with the rest of the package."" 400 F. Supp. at 778. As discussed below, the "
405,," major distinction between this case and CBS is that local stations do not have the market power or resources to compel source 
or direct licensing. The district court's finding in CBS that the per program license was available as a transitional device is 
therefore distinguishable.  Further, the district court's concern in CBS that because CBS had not even negotiated a per program 
license it could not complain about hypothetically burdensome terms is also not applicable here. The court in CBS expressly 
distinguished the networks from local stations which had, in fact, negotiated per program terms.  ASCAP's argument that, as in 
CBS, its per program license does not exist is unavailing.  ASCAP may not be insulated by the fact that the per program license 
has fallen into disuse since local stations' last effort to alter its terms."
405,37," Plaintiffs do not contend that direct licensing is not a realistic alternative for locally-produced programming. Since local 
television stations deal directly with the composers or copyright owners of the music contained in locally-produced programs, 
stations would not encounter difficulties in finding and obtaining music licenses from those composers and copyright owners.  Of 
course, as long as the blanket license exists, direct licensing of the locally-produced portion of local station broadcasting is not 
commercially feasible due to the double payment situation that would arise.  Given the double payment snare, direct licensing 
would not be a realistically available alternative unless the blanket license were discarded entirely. "
406,38," The court does not hereby resurrect the ""disinclination"" theory rejected in CBS. The district court in CBS found that copyright 
owners would not be disinclined to deal directly with CBS in view of CBS' market power.  The district court did not find that 
absent CBS' power copyright owners would be inclined to change the system. It is the latter situation that is presented here."
406,39," The court reaches this conclusion notwithstanding the fact found so probative in CBS that plaintiffs have never attempted to 
achieve direct licensing. In view of the court's findings that direct licensing is utterly unrealistic without centralized machinery and 
that the probability that such machinery would be created at the behest of local stations is remote, it would be unreasonable to 
draw any inferences unfavorable to plaintiffs' claims due to the absence of such self-help efforts.  Plaintiffs did, in any event, 
pursue the alternative they ultimately seek to bring about.  Those efforts to achieve source licensing are discussed in the 
following subsection. "
407,40," Defendants argue that this line of reasoning tracks the ""competitive disadvantage"" theory rejected in CBS. Defendants are 
incorrect.  The Court of Appeals in CBS ruled that direct licensing could not be held unavailable merely because CBS would find 
itself at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the two other networks if CBS were to change to direct licensing while the other two 
remained under the blanket license. 620 F.2d at 938 n. 9; see also 400 F. Supp. at 764. In the instant case, by contrast, the 
court finds that local stations could not bring about source licensing due to the competitive disadvantage that those stations 
demanding source licensing would suffer vis-a-vis those that did not.  The court's reasoning is clearly distinct from that rejected 
in CBS. "
408,41," BMI argues that the court must additionally find that defendants' practices cause the absence of alternatives, on the ground 
that the court could not otherwise conclude that the blanket license itself restrains trade.  The argument is analytically flawed and 
unsupported by the CBS case.  The Court of Appeals in CBS considered the availability of alternatives to be a threshold issue.  
That is, even if there is no price competition under the blanket licensing system, if the lack of competition endures due to 
customer preference then defendants cannot be held liable under the antitrust laws for restraining trade.  Once it is established 
that users have no alternative to the blanket license and that the system does not exist by virtue of customer preference, the 
court may consider whether the system restrains trade.  The restraint, if it then be found, is within the system.  In order to prove 
the restraint there is no need to prove that defendants' practices proximately caused the lack of alternatives to the system.  See 
Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 527 F. Supp. 758, 766 n. 10 (D. Del. 1981), aff'd mem., 691 F.2d 490 (3d Cir. 1982). HN4[
]"
408,42," On the strength of the expert testimony of its economist Bruce M. Owen, BMI contends that the overall price of television must 
be competitively set by virtue of the price competition that characterizes the licensing of synchronization and other rights at the 
producer level.  The contention is neither factually nor theoretically tenable.  The price of the synchronization and other rights to 
the music in a particular program is set competitively in negotiations between producers and copyright owners.  The price of the 
performing rights to the music in a particular program is encompassed within the fee for the blanket license negotiated between 
local television stations and ASCAP and BMI.  There is no evidence that the competitive limits on the price of synchronization 
rights exert any constraint on the price of performing rights.  Nor is the court aware of any economic theory or antitrust principle 
that compels, or even permits, the conclusion that the sum price of a product may be considered competitively set when the sum 
is comprised of two parts negotiated separately in two distinct transactions, one transaction characterized by price competition, 
the other not.  The court was therefore unpersuaded by the testimony of Mr. Owen.  Indeed, the court found the impact of Mr. 
Owen's entire testimony significantly diminished by the fact, elicited during cross-examination, that Mr. Owen previously testified, 
while serving as the chief economist of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, on behalf of the Government in United 
States v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 507 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), that ASCAP is an anticompetitive cartel."
408,43," Ultimately, price constraint is provided not by competition but by the consent decree's provision that users may petition the 
district court to determine a reasonable fee.  Of course, even were this court somehow to determine that defendants' blanket 
license fees are reasonable, the system would not thereby be immune to antitrust attack. The mandate of the Sherman Act is not 
that courts determine reasonable prices but that courts intervene where necessary to permit free market competition to set 
prices.  See Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 (1980) (per curiam); 
United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397-98, 71 L. Ed. 700, 47 S. Ct. 377 (1927). "
409,44," See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 527 F. Supp. 758 (D. Del. 1981), aff'd mem, 691 F.2d 490 (3d Cir. 1982) 
(antitrust challenge to blanket licensing of small establishments offering live music dismissed upon finding that blanket license 
was necessary and that there were no efficient or even feasible alternatives). "
411,45," As is clear from the foregoing, the blanket licensing system -- in particular, its fee which is based on users' revenues rather 
than actual use -- exists not for the convenience of local television stations but due to defendants' patent power.  Accordingly, 
defendants' licensing practices must also be declared misuse of copyright.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 
U.S. 100, 139, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969); see also BMI v. Moor-Law, Inc., supra, 527 F. Supp. at 772-73. "

shall determine that not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the arrangement is a publication other than a 
failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose of this chapter. "
432,2," The Antitrust Division's opinion was based on what it saw as two legal errors of the ALJ.  One was the ALJ's treatment of the 
buyer issue.  The other issue was the ALJ's exclusion, as a matter of law, of evidence on an incremental analysis of the P-I's 
financial condition. Plaintiffs have not raised the latter issue here, but maintain that even without such analysis, the P-I failed to 
prove it was in probable danger of financial failure. "
433,3," The test applicable to prospective arrangements is more stringent than the one for JOAs already in effect when the Act was 
passed.  For existing arrangements, it was necessary that, at the time the arrangement was entered into, not more than one of 
the newspapers ""was likely to remain or become a financially sound publication."" 15 U.S.C. § 1803(a). "
434,4," The Supreme Court has often emphasized the statements of the floor manager of a bill to support its interpretation of an 
ambiguous provision.  See, e.g., Guessefeldt v. McGrath, 342 U.S. 308, 311, 96 L. Ed. 342, 72 S. Ct. 338 (1952); Bindczyck v. 
Finucane, 342 U.S. 76, 83, 96 L. Ed. 100, 72 S. Ct. 130 (1952); United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 123, 86 L. 
Ed. 726, 62 S. Ct. 523 (1942)."
434,5," See In the Matter of Application by The Cincinnati Inquirer, Inc., and the E.W. Scripps Company for Approval of a Joint 
Operating Arrangement Pursuant to the Newspaper Preservation Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1801, et seq., Recommended Decision, pp. 
118-128. "
445,1," That claims such as plaintiff's § 1985 conspiracy charge are contemplated by Title VII is made clear in the Supreme Court's 
decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 1017, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974) which stated that: Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. to assure equality of employment 
opportunities by eliminating those practices and devices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, or national 
origin. This broad characterization seems clearly to embrace the plaintiff's claim. "
446,2," Some courts have employed the ""continuing violation doctrine"" to recognize timely filing of an EEOC complaint.  See, e.g., 
Roberts v. North American Rockwell Corporation, 650 F.2d 823 (6th Cir. 1981); Belt v. Johnson Motor Lines, 458 F.2d 443 (5th 
Cir. 1972). In Smith v. Office of Economic Opportunity for State of Arkansas, 538 F.2d 226 (8th Cir. 1976), the court held that 
""ordinarily an alleged discriminatory refusal to hire, standing alone, does not constitute a continuing wrong.  Where, however, the 
suit challenges a practice of discrimination rather than an isolated instance, the alleged violation may be deemed continuing."" 
538 F.2d at 228-29. The plaintiff has not sought to establish jurisdiction according to this theory.  Even had he done so, I am not persuaded that the 
allegations before me can be characterized as sufficient to establish an ongoing pattern of discrimination.  See generally Bronze 
Shields, Inc. v. New Jersey Dept. of Civil Service, 667 F.2d 1074 (1981) (discussing the scope of the continuing violation 
doctrine); Macklin v. Spector Freight Sys., Inc., 156 U.S. App. D.C. 69, 478 F.2d 979 (D.C.Cir.1973); Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. 
Co., 508 F.2d 239 (3d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1011, 95 S. Ct. 2415, 44 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1975). The plaintiff has alleged 
no facts demonstrating a practice by the defendants of actual discriminatory treatment of other applicants protected by Title VII, 
nor that he had a continuing ""present violation"" of his right to the privileges he sought.  Bronze Shields, supra, at 1081-84; 
United Air Lines v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1977)."
446,3," This case is thus readily distinguishable from the recent Third Circuit holdings in Bronze Shields and Hood v. New Jersey 
Department of Civil Service and Urban Pioneers, 680 F.2d 955 (3rd Cir.) (1982).  In those cases, the hiring decisions at issue 
had definitely foreclosed any chance the plaintiffs had for gaining the positions they desired. "
447,4," I note in passing, however, that the plaintiff's potential damages would be limited to the period subsequent to the cause of 
action he alleges accrued on April 25, 1979 and hence would not include those antecedent damages which might have been 
suffered as a result of the time-barred causes of action.  See, e.g., United Airlines v. Evans, supra, 431 U.S. at 558, 97 S. Ct. at 
1889; Jurinko, supra (damages were calculated from the time of the cause of action which invoked Title VII jurisdiction). One further question which has not been resolved to my satisfaction is whether Dr. Pao has met the jurisdictional requirement 
under § 2000e-5(c), which would require the referral of the plaintiff's complaint to the Pennsylvania Human Relations 
Commission (""PHRC"").  See, e.g., Bell v. Wyeth Labs, 448 F. Supp. 133 (E.D. Pa.1978). The plaintiff has alleged in his 
complaint that he received a ""right to sue"" letter from the EEOC pursuant to § 2000e-5(b).  If this ""right to sue"" letter includes a 
recital that the EEOC is satisfied that all the jurisdictional prerequisites have been met, the plaintiff would be exempted from 
having first to exhaust his remedial avenues with the PHRC.  See generally Huggler v. Elkins Stroud Suplee and Co., 505 F. 
Supp. 9, 11-12 (E.D.Pa.1980). Since the Supreme Court has made clear that the EEOC referral procedure comports with the 
jurisdictional requirements of § 2000e-5(c), Love v. Pullman, 404 U.S. 522, 92 S. Ct. 616, 30 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1972); Mohasco 
Corp. v. Silver, 447 U.S. 807, 100 S. Ct. 2486, 65 L. Ed. 2d 532, I will assume for the time being that jurisdiction will lie.  Of 
course, this court's jurisdiction is contingent upon the contents of the EEOC ""right to sue"" letter."
447,5," The individual defendants have raised the issue of whether they can be considered employers as defined by HN7[
]  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).  That provision allows for the term employer to encompass persons: "
448,," engaged in an industry affecting fifteen or more employees for each working day and each of the twenty or more calendar 
weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person . . . . It is unnecessary to consider whether Dr. Goldberg is an agent of the Hospital in light of the holding, infra, that he did not receive 
adequate notice of the plaintiff's EEOC complaint.  However, I find that the allegations in the amended complaint sufficiently 
qualify Mr. Gallagher, a member of the Hospital's Board of Directors, as an agent of the Hospital. "
449,6," I add, parenthetically, the unremarkable observation that the Peer Review Protection Act passed by the Pennsylvania General 
Assembly cannot endow the defendants with immunity with respect to the plaintiff's Title VII claims over which I have retained 
jurisdiction.  See e.g., Robinson v. Magovern, 83 F.R.D. 79 (W.D. Pa. 1979). "
451,1," HN1[
] 15 U.S.C. § 15c (a)(1) reads in pertinent part as follows: (a)(1) Any attorney general of a State may bring a civil action in the name of such State, as parens patriae on behalf of natural 
persons residing in such State, in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the defendant, to secure monetary 
relief as provided in this section for injury sustained by such natural persons to their property by reason of any violation of 
Sections 1 to 7 of this title. "
452,2," See, e.g., State ex rel. Taylor v. Wade, 360 Mo. 895, 231 S.W.2d 179, 182, (Mo. banc 1950). "
453,3," Cf.  State of New Mexico as Parens Patriae v. Scott & Fetzer Co. and Others, 1981-2 Trade Cases, para. 64,439, and State of 
Iowa v. Scott & Fetzer Co., Order, No. 81-362E (July 8, 1982) (Both upholding a state attorney general's power to bring parens 
patriae damage actions under 15 U.S.C. § 15c(a)(1) under statutory powers similar to those contained in the Missouri statutes)."
453,4," The section reads as follows: ""The general assembly shall have no power to grant public money or property, or lend or 
authorize the lending of credit, to any private person, association or corporation "". "
478,1," Independently of the other reasons expressed in this opinion for the dismissal of claims against the Kitch defendants, the 
Krasilovsky defendants, the ABC defendants and the ""other"" defendants, this analysis would require striking all reference to the 
Wayne County litigation from the amended complaint against them as well. "
480,2," Plaintiffs' argument that the Magistrate acted improperly by accepting their proposed findings of fact when detrimental to their 
case while rejecting them when supportive is without merit.  The proposed findings are a ""road map"" of what plaintiffs intend to 
prove at trial.  Proposed findings of fact (as well as the filing of proposed trial exhibits) were required by me, even though there is 
a jury demand, to set the framework of the case. In fact, they saved plaintiffs from having to respond further to certain of ABC 
defendants' interrogatories. See Pre-Trial Order No. 8 PD.  If plaintiffs assert they will prove a certain material fact, the 
Magistrate correctly must determine whether there is evidence in the record to support that assetion on summary judgment. On 
the other hand, if plaintiffs do not even assert by a proposed finding that they will prove a certain fact, the Magistrate may 
properly assume plaintiffs believe that fact is either irrelevant or unsupportable by evidence in the record. "
481,3," Count V of the amended complaint alleged a conspiracy to attempt to monopolize, which is not an offense under Sherman § 2 
and was dismissed by Judge Boyle.  See III P. Areeda and D. Turner, Antitrust Law (1978) P839 at 359. "
484,4," As the Magistrate recommends, I decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state law claims in Counts VIII, IX and 
XI as against the ABC defendants.  See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. 
Ct. 1130 (1966) (""certainly, if the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, 
the state claims should be dismissed as well""). The pendent state law claims in Count XII were dismissed as against the Kitch and Krasilovsky defendants in Parts V and VI, 
respectively, above and will be dismissed as against David Williams and the Sanders firm in Part IX(B) below.  As to Counts VIII, 
IX and XI as against the Kitch, Krasilovsky, Dozier and ""other"" defendants, to the extent the reasons expressed in this opinion 
regarding the federal claims are inapplicable to these state claims, I similarly decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over them 
under Gibbs. "
487,5," As noted in Part II(B) above, plaintiffs' motion for entry of a default judgment against David Williams, the Sanders firm and 
Reginald Dozier will be denied in light of this opinion.  In addition, the following pending motions will be denied as moot:"
487,1," .  Plaintiffs' motion to disqualify the law firm of Plunkett, Cooney, Rutt, Watters, Stanczyk & Pedersen, P.C. as counsel for 
the Kitch defendants;"
487,2, .  Plaintiffs' motion to disqualify the law firm of Sidley & Austin as counsel for the ABC defendants;
487,3, .  Plaintiffs' motion for relief from Pre-Trial Order No. 11;
487,4, .  The ABC defendants' motion to compel plaintiffs to further answer their first set of interrogatories;
487,5, .  The Kitch defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' answers to their second set of interrogatories; and
487,6," .  The Kitch defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' exhibit list, supplemental exhibit list and expert witness list. Pre-Trial Order No. 18 P1-3, ordering the ABC defendants to respond to certain discovery requests, which was stayed by Pre-
Trial Order No. 20 pending decision on their motion for summary judgment, will be vacated. "
488,," The only remaining motion appears to be the ABC defendants' motion for costs regarding the deposition of Clarence Tucker.  
See Memorandum dated February 2, 1982.  The ABC defendants shall advise the deputy clerk within ten (10) days whether they 
wish to proceed on this motion. "
492,1," Whittaker Corporation, Crown's former parent, also was named as defendant in the complaint. All claims against Whittaker, 
however, were dismissed before the case was submitted to the jury."

494,3," More specifically, RCM sought to restrict the relevant geographic market to the following units: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Howard, Montgomery, Prince Georges, and St. Mary's Counties, Maryland; 
Arlington, Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, King George, Loudoun, Prince William, and Stafford Counties, and Fairfax and 
Alexandria Cities, Virginia; and the District of Columbia. HN1[
]"
494,4," RCM relies heavily on statements by several witnesses that the siding industry generally regards metropolitan Washington as a 
distinct marketing region.  This common conception of a geographic market, however, is not interchangeable with the more 
precise definition required by Tampa Electric.  The Tampa Electric test is carefully tailored to reflect the potential monopoly 
power of a seller-defendant in disputes of this nature.  To the extent that cases decided under § 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 18, suggest that a less rigorous definition of the geographic market applies, we find those cases distinguishable.  See 
generally Comment, Relevant Geographic Market Delineation: The Interchangeability of Standards in Cases Arising Under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 1979 Duke L.J. 1152. "
495,5," The controversy in Beane arose over two neighbor's dispute about the use of one's property.  Although an employer's 
""blacklisting"" of a former employee prompted the litigation in Willner, the parties were not treated as potential competitors. The 
employer's action was motivated by his desire to quell labor unrest, rather than to stifle competition.  Indeed, the court in Willner 
stated that ""the law does not furnish a shield against the effects of fair and honest competition . . . ."" 109 Md. at 356, 71 A. at 
964."
495,6," The classic statement of this common law cause of action is found in § 90 of the Second Restatement of Contracts, which 
reads in pertinent part: HN6[
] A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the 
promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by 
enforcement of the promise. "
496,7," Although RCM's counsel requested this amount in his closing remarks, the jury increased the award to $1,128,663.00. See 
note 2 supra."

Attempt to Monopolize Case Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 10 Sw.L.Rev. 103 (1978), the present position, at least in this 
Circuit, is that the plaintiff in an attempt-to-monopolize case must prove a ""relevant market,"" which comprises both a geographic 
and a product market.  American Football League v. National Football League, 323 F.2d 124 (4th Cir. 1963). "
498,2," L. Sullivan, Handbook on the Law of Antitrust § 12, at 42 (1977)."
498,3," Brown Shoe Co., of course, arose under § 7 of the Clayton Act. Although the majority, without comment, dismisses cases 
arising under § 7 as distinguishable, there is a substantial body of both case law and commentary to the contrary.  See, e.g., van 
Kalinowski, Market Definition Under Section 2.  The Applicability of Clayton Act Section 7 Analysis, 10 Sw.L. Rev. 95 (1978);

498,4," Sullivan, supra, at 67."
498,5," Because the majority finds that there was no showing of a relevant geographic market, it did not reach the issue of relevant 
product market.  I note, however, that the jury was properly instructed on the definition of relevant product market, and heard 
evidence that only vinyl and steel were interchangeable with aluminum siding for product market purposes.  The jury's finding 
was not unreasonable or against the clear weight of the evidence. "
520,1," Nick Masabny and South Shore Subaru, Inc. "
526,2," In the Japanese language ""Subaru"" is the term for ""Pleiades,"" in turn the designation of a cluster in the constellation Taurus.  
The astronomical use of the term derives from Greek mythology in which the daughters of Atlas were collectively called 
Pleiades.  The star grouping was chosen by Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., Subaru's manufacturer, to symbolize the simultaneous 
unity and individuality of the six original companies which were merged, shortly after World War II, to form the Fuji conglomerate.  
All Subaru automobiles have the star cluster on their grilles.  See Automotive Iconography, Auto Week, July 26, 1982, at 21."
526,3," In addition to documents ordinarily found in an appendix, we have before us 129 documentary exhibits and a considerable 
portion of the oral testimony which has been designated by the parties from the twenty-two volumes of testimony given at the 
trial."
526,4," Background on Subaru's importing and regional distribution process is contained in Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, 
Inc., 534 F. Supp. 1282, 1284 (D.N.H. 1982)."
526,5," Ricky Smith operates a dual dealership of Subaru and Pontiac automobiles from its location in the town of Weymouth.  It was 
granted its Pontiac franchise from General Motors in 1959.  The trial judge found that to combine a foreign with an American line 
make in one dealership is a common practice in eastern Massachusetts. "
527,6," Also executed on the same date was an addendum to the agreement which provided that SNE would assume Masabny's legal 
defense against any claim that Masabny was located in the relevant market area of another Subaru franchisee. The agreement 
further provided for SNE's repurchase of automobiles and acquisition of Masabny's land and buildings in the event of a final 
judgment against him.  On the same date Masabny gave SNE a check for approximately $ 21,000 and signed a purchase order 
for a standard new dealer's package of parts, accessories, and supplies."
527,7," Masabny had applied to the town of Hanover for the necessary permits and licenses.  Because of a town moratorium on 
building in the area encompassing the dealership site, SNE and Masabny executed an amendment under which the site would 
be moved to the town of Pembroke.  Additionally, Masabny would be permitted to assign his dealership, while retaining 
executive and voting control, to South Shore Subaru, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation."
527,8, Midway brought a related action against SNE which was settled before Ricky Smith's action came to trial.
527,9," The term ""travel rate"" was also used at trial to denote a dealer's average number of sales over a three-month period.  As used 
in this sense, the travel rate affects the monthly allocation of automobiles from the distributor to a dealer. Other factors affecting 
monthly allocations include the inventory and sales of all dealers in the region, the awarding of new dealerships and the 
upgrading of existing dealers' allocations in the region.  A low initial allocation, poor sales over a three-month period, or a large 
inventory on the closing date of a three-month period, would tend to lower monthly allocations.  It is often difficult for an 
established dealer to increase its allocation.  Although Ricky Smith sold all the Subarus it was allocated in 1978, and was listed 
as ninth in sales among seventy-four Subaru dealers in New England, its monthly allocation did not meaningfully increase 
because other New England dealers were also selling well and competing for the automobiles available to the distributor. While 
the plaintiff's sales averaged fifteen per month, automobiles left in inventory averaged nineteen per month, thereby affecting its 
travel rate and hence its monthly allocations.  From one shipment Ricky Smith was allocated only ten new cars.  The offer of an 
initial allocation of fifty Subarus was an attractive incentive in view of the public's demand for the car and the restrictions of its 
supply. "
528,10," Midway was also offered and declined the Hanover area franchise, ultimately choosing instead to remain in its present location 
and accept an upgraded allocation of vehicles."
528,11," Congress's passage of the 1956 Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1225 (1976), did not preempt the 
field.  A number of States have enacted regulatory schemes designed to eliminate unfair and coercive practices by automobile 
manufacturers and distributors. See generally, Annot.  7 A.L.R. 3d 1173 (1966); Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Oldsmobile, 
Inc., 376 Mass. 313, 319-320 (1978); Brown & Cohen, Franchise Equities, 63 Mass. L. Rev. 109, 112 (1978)."
528,12," The parties make no contention that the plaintiff was required by the 1970 version of § 4(3)(l) to arbitrate rather than litigate its 
dispute with SNE.  Under the 1970 statute, arbitration was required only when the appointment was made by a ""manufacturer,"" 
as defined in § 1(b) of c. 93B.  This limitation on arbitration was apparently based on the prevailing market conditions in 1970 
when the domestic automobile industry was controlled by the so called ""Big Three"" manufacturers, General Motors, Ford and 
Chrysler.  See generally 1968 Senate Doc. No. 983, 21-26, 43-46; Brown, A Bill of Rights for Auto Dealers, 12 B.C. Indus. & 
Comm. L. Rev., 757, 760-761 (1971).  Arbitration was not required under the 1970 statute when the new dealer appointment 
was made by a ""distributor"" like SNE, as that term was and still is defined in § 1(g) of c. 93B.  We do not read the dictum in 
Foreign Auto Import, Inc. v. Renault Northeast, Inc., 367 Mass. 464, 471-472 (1975), which discusses the arbitration provisions 
of the 1970 statute, as inconsistent with these conclusions."
528,13," Peripheral decisions dealing with the statute include Hein-Werner Corp. v. Jackson Indus., Inc., 364 Mass. 523 (1974) 
(defining the term ""motor vehicle"" as used in G. L. c. 93B, § 1[a], and declaining to apply the statute to contracts antedating its 
enactment), Foreign Auto Import, Inc. v. Renault Northeast, Inc., supra (dismissing appeal as interlocutory and discussing in "
529,," dictum arbitration provisions in § 4[3][l]), and Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 378 Mass. 707 (1979) (affirming 
dismissal of complaint on grounds that c. 93B governs remedies for violation of the statute and that § 12 does not provide for 
preliminary injunctive relief). "
530,14," The defendants also proposed that the judge consider, before determining the plaintiff's relevant market area, the eight criteria 
added to c. 93B by St. 1977, c. 717, § 3, with respect to the possible arbitrariness of appointing an additional franchisee. The "
531,," judge was not obliged, under either the 1970 or the 1977 version of the statute, to consider the factors governing arbitrariness on 
the question of the geographical boundaries of the existing franchisee's relevant market area.  He properly considered these 
criteria, as will be discussed later, in deciding whether the Masabny appointment was justified."
531,15," That language reads as follows: ""The 1970 statute did not carry a definition of 'relevant market area', but the concept of a 
geographic market is a familiar one, explicated in Federal antitrust law [citations omitted]."""
531,16, The defendants are represented by new counsel on appeal. 
532,17," The judge received this evidence (indeed almost all the evidence at the trial) de bene, expressly reserving the right to 
determine relevancy after the conclusion of the trial.  All trial counsel acquiesced in this approach.  The procedure was sensible 
in view of the novelty and complexity of the legal issues and the numerous (and sometimes amorphous) circumstances involved 
in determining an automobile dealership's relevant market area ""exclusively by equitable principles."""
532,18," Most of the evidence on retail service sales that was introduced came from the defendants since the plaintiff took the position 
that it was not required to introduce such evidence.  In addition to bearing on relevant market area, the plaintiff's service sales 
record is also relevant to the question of arbitrariness of the additional appointment. The second guideline in the 1977 statute for 
resolution of that issue specifically requires consideration of ""the retail sales and service business transacted by the objecting 
motor vehicle dealer . . . during the three year period immediately preceding . . . notice [of a new appointment] as compared to 
the business available to [the dealer]."""
532,19," The fact that defense counsel joined in the error does not in our view bring the case within the general principle stated in 
Jones v. Wayland, 374 Mass. 249, 252-253 n.3 (1978). See Matter of Roche, 381 Mass. 624, 629 n.7 (1980); Altschuler v. 
Boston Rent Bd., 386 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1982). Defense counsel consistently took the position throughout the trial that the 1970 
statute governed and that the judge could not consult the 1977 statute for guidance.  This position was repeated in the 
defendants' requests for rulings of law.  As is evident by now, both the 1970 and 1977 statutes are complex and difficult both in 
theory and applicantion.  At the time of trial, neither statute's application to hard facts had been discussed by an appellate court.  
The proximity of the Masabny appointment to the effective date of the 1977 amendments further complicated the case.  In the 
circumstances, we think the issue has been properly saved for review. "
533,20," The parties agree that the Tober decision expressly authorized the trial judge to look to and apply these criteria.  The judge 
below stated that he gave consideration ""to the clear language of the amended statute"" to determine whether justification existed 
for SNE's appointment of Masabny."
533,21," In addition to the dealings between SNE, Ricky Smith and Midway which occurred just prior to Masabny's appointment (see 
background facts, supra), the judge found that it was obvious that SNE ""was not going to give the plaintiff the opportunity to say 
'yes,' considering the fact that the plaintiff had only five days to accept a speculative offer with little or no information upon which "
534,," to proceed."" He also found with respect to SNE's offer to Midway that SNE ""knew . . . that [Midway] was not in a financial 
position to take advantage of the offer . . . . [SNE] also had to know that placing a new dealership [near Midway] would further 
compromise the dealership's financial position."" Finally, the trial judge found that there was ""no credible evidence . . . that . . . 
[SNE] presented [to Ricky Smith] any statistical criteria to justify the establishment of a new dealership in Hanover."""
534,22," Section 20.2 of the franchise agreement imposed a similar obligation on SNE by requiring, prior to any new dealer 
appointment ""in or near"" the market area of an existing dealer, ""discussion with affected [d]ealers, [whether] additional sales and 
service facilities are warranted, based upon objective statistical criteria used by [SNE] to determine market potential in the area."""
534,23," Section 13 of c. 93B expressly provides that the statute's requirements control inconsistent contract provisions.  Although this 
provision appears to leave the parties free to agree upon requirements more stringent than the statute, we do not think that the 
use of the word ""near"" in section 20.2 of this agreement expands the plaintiff's rights beyond the rights conferred in § 4(3)(l)."
534,24," The finding that SNE committed a breach of contract by failing to discuss Masabny's appointment with the plaintiff with 
reasons based upon objective statistical criteria would not provide the plaintiff with a separate ground of recovery in the absence 
of proof of damages caused by that breach. "
535,25, The 1977 amendments to c. 93B did not change this provision.
535,26," Specifically, the judge found: ""Although there is some evidence . . . that this Subaru dealers' association raised a small amount 
of money for attorneys fees and expenses, for the purpose of subsidizing legitimate legal action against . . . SNE, one of the 
underlying aims of such an association is to assist one of its members financially when pursuing a legal action in which all may 
have a common interest.  From the evidence, it would appear that there are three suits pending in New England by Subaru 
dealers against SNE; this case is one of them.  There are now 77 Subaru dealers in New England; legal action by three of them 
does not appear to have inhibited SNE from any of its legitimate activities."" "
536,27," The closest the Council seems to have come to a possible antitrust violation was a motion by which it asked its attorney and a 
committee to ""act very swiftly on the subject of a moratorium on new dealers and a minimum allotment per dealer per month 
(Report to follow)."" The report which in fact followed led merely to a resolve that SNE should take immediate steps ""to insure that 
. . . existing franchises receive an adequate and equitable supply of Subarus and that decisions to award new franchises take 
into consideration the insufficient supply of Subarus presently available to the existing dealers."" This resolve did not infringe 
upon the antitrust laws."
536,28," This would be the area marked ""B"" on the following sketch taken from a portion of one of the plaintiff's exhibits at trial.  It is a 
conceptualization of the relevant market areas of the two dealerships on the assumption that Masabny's area would be the same 
size as the plaintiff's.  In fact, of course, each dealer's area would probably be irregular in shape.June 1, 1975, to May 31, 1978, 
Sales [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] A + B = Ricky Smith's relevant market area B + C = Masabny's relevant market area"
536,29," HN14[
] ""Any contract or part thereof or practice thereunder in violation of any provision of this chapter shall be deemed 
against public policy and shall be void and unenforceable."" The 1977 amendments did not change this provision."
536,30," The 1970 statute did not allow dealers and franchisors to petition for injunctive relief to stay the grant of a new competitive 
motor vehicle franchise. See Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 378 Mass. 707, 709 n.3, 712 (1979). Under §§ 
4(l), 12, and 13 of that statute, enforcement of rights was remitted to arbitration, action by the Attorney General, claims for 
damages, and requests to have contracts found in violation of the statute voided.  The Reiter decision, however, addressed the 
problem of injunctive relief in the context of a request for a preliminary injunction.  See also Foreign Auto Import, Inc. v. Renault 
Northeast, Inc., 367 Mass. at 471-472. The judge appears to have looked to § 12A, inserted by the 1977 statute, as support for 
his orders directing South Shore to cease operations within sixty days and prohibiting SNE from terminating the plaintiff's 
franchise. That statute expressly authorizes the issuance of an injunction to curb violations of c. 93B.  The judge's use of § 12A 
from the 1977 statute suggests that despite the applicability of the 1970 statute there might have been an over-utilization of the 
principles of the new statute.  We think, however, that the trial judge had the power, incidental to the express authority conferred "
537,," in § 12 of the 1970 statute, to enter the orders in question, and, if it became necessary, to enforce the orders by resort to the 
court's contempt power."
537,31," At the time of trial, there was evidence that Masabny had sold twenty-seven new Subaru vehicles in the ""B"" area in this four-
month period.  See note 28, supra.  The plaintiff's expert had predicated sales of 24 vehicles by South Shore in the ""B"" area in 
all of 1979.  As a result he suggested that his August, 1978, projection ""was indeed a very conservative one because in one-third 
of a year [South Shore] had already exceeded the number of sales . . . that I had projected for the whole year."" "
538,32," This view of an automobile dealership was acknowledged at trial as one recognized in the industry and in common use by 
dealerships selling General Motors products."
538,33," There was evidence to warrant a conclusion that in the last five years of the dealership's business the plaintiff sold 
approximately two Pontiacs for each Subaru."
538,34, An appropriate adjustment to factor profits and expense attributable to fleet business out of the calculations was made.
538,35," There was evidence, however, that fixed overhead was considered by application of General Motors' ""break-even"" system of 
accounting.  This system calculates the number of vehicle sales necessary to absorb the dealership's actual fixed overhead. 
That number becomes the dealership's ""break-even"" point.  According to the plaintiff's president, sales above that figure 
generate a ""net amount . . . [which] is pure profit, with some modifications."" "
539,36," The plaintiff's expense statement (see e.g. exhibit 18D) follows General Motors' method of accounting which establishes three 
categories of expenses: variable expenses; semi-fixed expenses, and fixed overhead. The variable expenses are those outlined 
in step (v) of the calculations above.  Semi-fixed expenses according to the General Motors system include such items as 
salaries of owners, supervisors and clerical personnel, other salaries, absentee compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits 
and pensions, used car maintenance, company vehicle expense, office supplies, advertising, policy work on parts and service, 
outside service, travel and telephone.  Fixed expenses include such items as rent (mortgage or amortized leasehold), repairs to 
real estate, taxes, insurance on building and improvements, heat, light and power, equipment rental and depreciation."
539,37," ""In summary, then, this Court finds that the damage theory proffered by plaintiff is wholly inadequate and insufficient to support 
any award by the jury, for the reasons that it was based: (1) on a profit figure which was not an acceptable net profit; (2) upon 
assumptions concerning distribution and projected sales which were not supported by the record; (3) upon assumptions and 
conjectures specifically disclaimed by the witnesses who drew their conclusions therefrom; (4) upon the opinion of an expert who 
improperly based his assumptions upon that of another witness; (5) upon assumptions which made no attempt to separate lost 
profits or lost sales relating only to the Pontiac aspect of plaintiff's business as distinguished from its other operations . . .; (6) 
upon assumptions which made no attempt to limit damages to the applicable period of potential recovery; and (7) upon 
speculation, conjecture and guesswork.  There being no other evidence on damages, it follows that the proof was insufficient to 
allow the jury to reasonably infer that plaintiff had suffered damages in any amount."" "
540,38," There was some proof that it would not incur additional fixed expense.  We do not think the judge erred in reasoning that this 
type of expense would not have increased by reason of the extra sales since the plaintiff had the existing facilities to handle 
them.  The judge could have reasoned that the increases which did occur in fixed expenses had been caused by increases in 
items such as taxes, heat, light and power, and insurance on the buildings and improvements which had been brought about by 
the steady effects of inflation."
540,39," Such was the case in Randy's Studebaker Sales, Inc: v. Nissan Motor Corp., 533 F.2d 510 (10th Cir. 1976), where a variable 
net profit analysis somewhat analogous to the one used here (i.e. gross profit less variable selling expenses) was approved on 
appeal despite no deduction for fixed overhead. The court noted that the ""increase in costs created by increased sales activity 
would be absorbed by the increased revenue from parts and service that also would be generated by increased sales . . . [and 
further] evidence that . . . fixed overhead costs are covered by profits from parts and service."" 533 F.2d at 518. We take this as 
some indication that possible increases in what are characterized in this case as ""semi-fixed"" and ""fixed expenses"" can be offset 
by anticipated profits from parts and service generated by sales of more new and used vehicles. "
541,40," The 1977 amendment to c. 93B rewrote § 12 to delete the damages link with c. 93A, §§ 9 and 10.  New §§ 12 and 12A 
provided that enforcement of the statute could be requested by an injured party from the Attorney General or sought by way of 
an action in the Superior Court for damages and equitable relief, including injunctive relief.  The reference in § 12 of the 1970 
version of the statute to §§ 9 and 10 of c. 93A was occasioned by the fact that § 11 of c. 93A, was not inserted until almost two 
years after the passage of c. 93B.  See St. 1972, c. 614, § 2."
541,41," The complaint also sought recovery pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, §§ 2 and 11.  As now recognized by the plaintiff, the decision in 
Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 378 Mass. 707 (1979), forecloses any right to a separate recovery under c. 93A 
except to the extent that § 12 of the 1970 version of c. 93B allowed possible multiplication of damages.  The Reiter case was 
decided after this action was commenced."
541,42," If this were not the case, we would express the view that the absence of a demand letter from the plaintiff to SNE as described 
in, and expressly required by, G. L. c. 93A, § 9, prior to the commencement of this action precludes the plaintiff as a matter of 
law from recovering multiple damages and attorneys' fees.  We recognize that the demand letter requirement is jurisdictional 
under § 9 of G. L. c. 93A, and that failure to comply with the requirement requires dismissal of the entire lawsuit.  See Slaney v. 
Westwood Auto, Inc., 366 Mass. 688, 704 (1975); Entrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc., 368 Mass. 812, 813 (1975). Although 
reference to c. 93A, § 9, in § 12 of the 1970 version of c. 93B was somewhat oblique, we do not think the Legislature intended 
such a dire consequence to flow from the absence of a demand letter in a c. 93B case.  The construction we place on the 
reference in § 12 is a practical one intended to foster the over-all purposes of c. 93B.  There is no contention that the exception 
to the demand letter requirement stated in c. 93A, § 9(3), applies.  Nor is there any evidence to support a conclusion that the 
demand letter requirement had been waived.  See York v. Sullivan, 369 Mass. 157, 163-164 (1975)."
541,43," There is some indication in the record, although not confirmed yet by counsel, that Masabny may have closed his business. "
545,1," Although the Ninth Circuit in State of New Mexico v. American Petrofina, 501 F.2d 363 (9 Cir. 1974), held that a state once 
found to be a state is not covered by the Sherman Act, 501 F.2d at 371, the Supreme Court in Lafayette impliedly overruled such 
an expansive ruling.  The Fifth Circuit's opinion in Lafayette also took a position directly contrary to the Ninth Circuit by holding a 
""subordinate state governmental body is not ipso facto exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws."" 532 F.2d 431, 434 (5 
Cir. 1976). "
547,2," HN8[

prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state. "
554,1," The Municipality's claims are against Hitachi Cable, McBride, Ellis, and four Hitachi employees, Naoto Kudo, Hajime Noda, 
Takao Shiomi, and Yoshitoki Kato. Hitachi Cable has filed counterclaims against the Municipality, cross-claims against McBride and Ellis, and third party claims 
against Marubeni Corporation and Marubeni America Corporation.  None of Hitachi's counter-, cross-, or third party claims are at 
issue here. "
555,2," These additional claims are for inducement to breach a fiduciary duty, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional misrepresentation, 
negligent misrepresentation, misappropriation of confidential information, intentional interference with prospective advantage, 
bad faith breach of contract, commercial bribery, and violation of the Alaska antitrust laws, A.S. 45.50.562,.564."
555,3," The section provides in full: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or to receive or 
accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, 
except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the other "
556,," party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in 
fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by 
whom such compensation is so granted or paid."
556,4," Cf., Karseal v. Richfield Oil Corp., 221 F.2d 358, 362 (9th Cir. 1955). "
557,5," Bunker Ramo holds in effect that only actual competitors of the parties can suffer competitive injury, while traditional antitrust 
standing principles have extended standing to a much broader class of persons.  See, e.g., Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 
457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 2548-49, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982) (subscriber to group health plan has standing to sue for 
damages resulting from conspiracy between health plan and doctors' organization); Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 670 F.2d 
1378 (9th Cir. 1982) (employee has standing to bring suit against employer when he is forced to resign because of failure to 
participate in price fixing scheme); Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., 232 F.2d 190 (9th Cir. 1956) (non-operating lessor of 
theater has standing to sue for conspiracy to monopolize the exhibition of motion pictures). "
558,6," The Supreme Court has noted in connection with related questions under section 2(a) that standing rules should not be used to 
exclude those who, like the Municipality, are the principal victims of antitrust violations.  Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 
642, 649, 89 S. Ct. 1871, 1875, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1969)."
558,7," See, e.g., Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, 454 F.2d 1292 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 
930, 92 S. Ct. 1776, 32 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1972) (lessor); Billy Baxter v. Coca-Cola Co., 431 F.2d 183 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 
401 U.S. 923, 91 S. Ct. 877, 27 L. Ed. 2d 826 (1971) (franchisor); Walker Distributing Co. v. Lucky Lager Brewing Co., 323 F.2d 
1 (9th Cir. 1963) (shareholder). "
559,8," Support for this position can also be found in Grace v. E.J. Kozin Co., 538 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1976). Kozin involved a claim by a 
seafood company that Kozin had bribed one of its employees.  Grace was the trustee in bankruptcy for the S.I. Greene 
Company, a seafood wholesaler and competitor of the defendant, E.J. Kozin Company.  Kozin entered into an agreement with 
Bernard Kane, an officer of Greene's, whereby Kane represented Kozin as a sales agent.  Kane convinced Greene to make 
purchases from Kozin and received as compensation from Kozin one-half of the latter's profits on the resulting sales.  The district 
court found that Greene had a cause of action against Kozin under section 2(c) and the circuit affirmed. The precedential value of this opinion is decreased by the dual role in which Greene appears.  The court expressly noted that 
Greene and Kozin were both wholesalers in the same market and were competitors. Since Kozin sold to Greene, however, the 
two corporations were also related as buyer and seller and were in that sense not competitors. Greene was awarded damages 
because the price it paid Kozin was higher by the amount of the bribe Kozin paid to Kane.  These were not damages to its status 
as seller and competitor of Kozin, but rather to its status as a buyer."
559,9," The Municipality also claims that Hitachi is estopped from denying liability on the Sherman Act and RICO claims.  See, infra. "
560,10," See, also, Green v. Ancora-Citronelle, 577 F.2d 1380 (9th Cir. 1978) (means of arriving at a judgment do not detract from its 
conclusiveness)."
560,11," The full text of Judge Byrnes' findings is as follows: I find that there is a basis in fact to the plea of guilty to the counts set forth, and that Mr. Suzuki and Mr. Ransom, and Mr. 
Suzuki's acceptance and Mr. Allison's statements, indicate that sometime in 1973 and continuing thereafter an express or 
implied agreement was entered into between Hitachi and Marubeni calling for the payment of funds to Mr. McBride and through 
and to Mr. Ellis in return for the receipt of certain prebid information that would benefit Marubeni and Hitachi in making bids for 
certain contracts with the Anchorage Telephone Utility. The agreement contemplated that the funds to be used in the bribery attempt would be contributed by both Marubeni and 
Hitachi; that the funds from Hitachi would be provided through a billing process and applied with the funds from Marubeni, would 
be paid on an approximate 4 percent commission basis to Ellis that would be shared equally with McBride; That in return for the bribe of McBride he would supply certain prebid information that would be helpful to Hitachi and Marubeni -- 
to Hitachi, in providing the bid, submitting the bid. That Hitachi believed that under the agreement that Marubeni would take care of the details that would be necessary to carry out 
the purpose of this agreement; that one of the purposes of the agreement constituted a scheme to defraud to obtain money by 
false pretenses. That Hitachi understood that the bribe and the receipt of information from the bribe would be accomplished by certain interstate 
travel of various individuals and by the use of certain telexes in foreign and interstate commerce, and by the use of certain bank 
documents and checks. That Hitachi aided and abetted in the interstate travel and communication of the telexes and bank documents and checks by 
providing the funds that were necessary to the accomplishment of the bribe and the scheme attached thereto, and also by 
utilizing the information that was received in return for the bribe in preparing and processing and submitting the bid based upon 
the illegally-obtained information. "
561,," Mr. Suzuki advises that Hitachi intended to defraud and to obtain money by false pretenses and entered into this scheme to 
accomplish that intent. I find that the plea of guilty is freely and voluntarily being entered, and there was no coercion exerted upon Hitachi, either to 
enter the scheme and carry it out, nor was there any coercion or duress entered upon them to offer these pleas. The pleas will be accepted and entered.  The remaining two counts, upon the government's representation, will be dismissed at 
the time of sentencing.  Plea transcript, pages 59-61. "
562,12," Hitachi has attached to its briefs the text of several trial court decisions in which a cause of action under RICO was dismissed 
for lack of standing.  Waterman Steamship Corp. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 527 F. Supp. 256 (E.D.La.1981); Landmark 
Savings & Loan v. Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Co., 527 F. Supp. 206 (E.D.Mich.1981); Alice M. Harper v. New Japan "
563,," Securities International, Inc., 545 F. Supp. 1002 (C.D.Cal.1982); North Barrington Development, Inc. v. Richard Fanslow, 547 F. 
Supp. 207 (N.D.Ill. 1980). No motion to dismiss the Municipality's RICO claim for lack of standing has been filed and the issue 
has not been adequately briefed.  I therefore will not consider it here. "
568,*," When this appeal was heard, Judge Pratt was a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by 
designation.  He was inducted as a judge of this Court on June 29, 1982."

aside orders of the Commission shall be exclusive."
568,2," The Commission's order, dated Sept. 23, 1981, reads as follows: FINAL ORDER This matter having been heard by the Commission upon the appeal of complaint counsel from the initial decision, and upon 
briefs and oral argument in support thereof and in opposition thereto, and the Commission for the reasons stated in the 
accompanying Opinion having determined to reverse in part the initial decision: IT IS ORDERED that the initial decision of the administrative law judge be adopted as the Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law of the Commission, except to the extent it is inconsistent with the accompanying Opinion.  Other Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law of the Commission are contained in the accompanying Opinion. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following order to divest be, and it hereby is, entered: I. IT IS ORDERED that respondent, Tenneco, Inc. (hereinafter ""Tenneco""), a corporation, and its officers, directors, agents, 
representatives, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, shall divest all stock, assets, title, properties, 
interest, rights and privileges, of whatever nature, tangible and intangible, including without limitation all buildings, 
machinery, equipment, raw material reserves, inventory, customer lists, trade names, trademarks, and other property of 
whatever description acquired by Tenneco as a result of its acquisition of Monroe Auto Equipment Company (hereinafter 
""Monroe"") together with all additions and improvements to Monroe subsequent to the acquisition. Such divestiture shall be 
absolute, shall be accomplished no later than one (1) year from the service of this Order, and shall be subject to the prior 
approval of the Federal Trade Commission. II. "
569,," IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that such divestiture shall be accomplished absolutely to an acquirer approved in advance by 
the Federal Trade Commission so as to transfer Monroe as a going business and a viable, competitive, independent 
concern. III. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pending any divestiture required by this Order, respondent shall not knowingly cause or 
permit the deterioration of the assets and properties specified in Paragraph I in a manner that impairs the marketability of 
any such assets and properties.  Respondent may but shall not be required to make capital expenditures for the 
improvement of any such assets and properties. IV. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to the requirements of Paragraph I, none of the stock, assets, properties, rights, 
privileges and interests of whatever nature, tangible or intangible, acquired or added by Tenneco, shall be divested, directly 
or indirectly, to anyone who is at the time of the divestiture an officer, director, employee or agent of, or under the control, 
direction or influence of Tenneco or anyone who owns or controls, directly or indirectly more than one (1) percent of the 
outstanding shares of the capital stock of Tenneco or to anyone who is not approved in advance by the Federal Trade 
Commission. V. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that for a period of ten (10) years from the date this Order becomes final, Tenneco shall cease 
and desist from acquiring, or acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries or otherwise, without the prior 
approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the whole or any part of the stock, share capital, assets, any interest in or any 
interest of, any concern, corporate or noncorporate, engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, or selling, 
shock absorbers, nor shall Tenneco for a period of ten (10) years from the date this Order becomes final enter into any 
agreement, understanding or arrangement with any such concern by which Tenneco obtains the market share, in whole or 
in part, of such concern in the above described product lines, without the prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. VI. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within sixty (60) days from the effective date of this Order and every sixty (60) days 
thereafter until it has fully complied with Paragraph I of this Order, Tenneco shall submit a verified report in writing to the 
Federal Trade Commission setting forth in detail the manner and form in which it intends to comply, is complying or has 
complied therewith.  All such reports shall include, in addition to such other information and documentation as may 
hereafter be requested, (a) a specification of the steps taken by Tenneco to make public its desire to divest Monroe, (b) a 
list of all persons or organizations to whom notice of divestiture has been given, (c) a summary of all discussions and 
negotiations together with the identity and address of all interested persons or organizations, and (d) copies of all reports, 
internal memoranda, offers, counteroffers, communications and correspondence concerning said divestiture. VII. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Tenneco shall notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any proposed 
changes which may affect compliance obligations arising out of the Order, such as dissolution, assignment or sale resulting 
in the emergence of successor corporations, and that this Order shall be binding in any such successor. J. App. 188-90."
569,3," Section 7 of the Clayton Act HN1[
] provides in pertinent part: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of 
the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, 
the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
569,15, U.S.C. § 18 (1976). 
571,4," Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act HN2[
] provides in pertinent part: Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, 
are declared unlawful."
571,15, U.S.C. § 45(a) (1) (1976). 
574,5," As noted earlier in this subsection, Tenneco had already acquired a very small manufacturing company, Triple S Industries, 
that held a patent on a new and unproven shock absorber design, the Terramatic.  While the Commission viewed this acquisition 
as contributing to Tenneco's ability to manufacture shock absorbers, see Commission Opinion at 20-22, J. App. at 210-12, and 
as exhibiting Tenneco's interest in the market, see id. at 35-38, J. App. at 225-28, it did not address the Triple S acquisition in its 
discussion of Tenneco's potential de novo or toehold entry, see id. at 57-67, J. App. at 247-57.  Accordingly, we infer that the 
Commission did not consider the Terramatic patent sufficient technology to facilitate de novo entry or Triple S as a viable vehicle 
for toehold entry. "
580,1," Tenneco attempts to minimize its efforts at entry by pointing to the disadvantages posed by each: (1) that its negotiations with 
Armstrong died in July 1974 when the latter indicated that it was not for sale; (2) that negotiations through a broker for DeCarbon 
likewise failed because it set a selling price of 100 times earnings; and (3) that although it acquired the Terramatic patent with its 
purchase of Triple S, it did not allocate any of the purchase price to the patent. The record and findings of the ALJ, however, 
reveal other evidence from which continuing interest in a new entry by toe-hold acquisition may reasonably be inferred. The ALJ found that Tenneco, following Armstrong's 1974 refusal to sell, nevertheless believed Armstrong might react differently 
if it received a specific offer above the price quoted on the exchange for its stock.  Moreover, Tenneco instructed its European 
office to maintain contact with Armstrong.  The ALJ further found that Tenneco ""continued to maintain its interest in Armstrong 
through 1976."" Tenneco acquired Monroe in 1976.  Similarly, with respect to DeCarbon, the ALJ found that, although ""the matter 
of price blocked a possible acquisition from the outset,"" Tenneco in November 1976, during its on-going negotiations with 
Monroe, instructed the broker who had brought the DeCarbon prospect to Tenneco, to ""stay in contact with the situation."" With respect to its ""Terramatic"" patent acquired from Triple S, Tenneco as late as August 12, 1976, took steps to insure that the 
patent rights be preserved and shortly prior to its acquisition of Monroe indicated that it planned to use the Terramatic design in 
the manufacture of steering dampers and to adapt it to other types of shock absorbers. "
588,*," The Flintkote Company, which was not previously named as a defendant in this litigation, owned Hankins Container (Hankins) 
prior to the acquisition of Hankins by defendant MacMillan Bloedel in 1972.  The settlement with Flintkote requires class 
members to give up all of their claims which are or could be asserted in this litigation, including both federal and state antitrust 
law claims, against the Flintkote Company, and all such claims against Hankins. "
600,*," All records supporting your verified claim should not be submitted with the claim form but should be retained for inspection by 
the court or its appointee."
600,**," While estimates should be used where no other documentation is available, the court may, upon review of the claims, 
determine to exclude estimated purchases from ""allowable purchases"" for the purpose of payment of claims. "
606,1," The first contract between the parties was executed in February, 1971, and explicitly granted to Roux the exclusive right to 
provide anesthesia services.  This exclusive language was deleted when the parties entered into a second contract in January, 
1976.  However, the executive director of the hospital testified that another provision, retained in the 1976 contract, had the 
same effect as the provision deleted. Regardless of the existence of any exclusive contract between the parties at present, the 
hospital continues to maintain the type of closed group policy at issue here.  There is no question, hence, but that this is indeed 
a live controversy. "
607,2," This point of justification is rebutted quite easily, however, since Dr. Kermit Roux, president of Roux and Associates, admitted 
that he would feel professionally bound to provide such coverage even in the absence of an exclusive contract. It was Dr. Roux, 
after all, who requested that the exclusive language in the contract be removed.  At trial, Dr. Roux explained the reason for his 
request: Q The Judge asked you if in fact when the 1976 contract was negotiated and executed, you asked that the language calling 
for the exclusion of the other anesthesiologists be deleted from the contract. A Yes, sir. Q So that it would no longer be a part of the contract? A Yes, sir.  The reason we did that, there were a number of reasons.  There was this other group that had requested to 
come practice there and led us to believe that some physicians preferred them to give their anesthetics.  And if that were 
true, then I think they should be allowed to practice. The other reason is pretty much what you have alluded to, I didn't want to be there on the basis of hiding behind a contract.  
If I couldn't provide the service as best I could, then someone else ought to have a shot at it. And I had been told by people a number of times that, you're hiding behind the contract because it gives you exclusive 
privileges ""exclusive privileges"" and doesn't let anyone else come.  And I don't believe that that's the way medicine should 
be practiced.  It should be practiced on the basis of the person whom the physician or the patient feels can do the best job, 
should be their physician. So, we finally got them to delete that part of the contract. Record on Appeal, vol. 3, at 7-8. After this language was deleted, he continued to provide twenty-four hour a day coverage. Although the hospital's executive 
director testified that another provision, retained in the 1976 contract, had the same effect as the provision deleted, Dr. Roux did 
not operate under this interpretation of the contract."
607,3," Since we base our decision today exclusively on Section 1 of the Sherman Act, we do not unnecessarily recite the other 
portions of the lower court's judgment and appellant's challenges thereto. "
609,4," See, e.g., U.S. Steel v. Fortner, 429 U.S. 610, 97 S. Ct. 861, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977); Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S. Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20 
(1947); IBM Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 56 S. Ct. 701, 80 L. Ed. 1085 (1936)."
609,5," Amicus curiae, the Louisiana Medical Society, properly points out that this is not the figure which is important for this case. The 
court should have determined the geographic market in which the hospital competes for the provision of surgical facilities.  In 
light of our resolution of the geographic market issue, however, we need not remand the case for a more specific finding. "
610,6," We recognize that anesthesiologists do work with specialists other than surgeons. However, the vast majority of their work is 
done in conjunction with surgery; this is the basis for our generalization."
610,7," The district judge's determination that strictly quality considerations led the hospital to enter into an exclusive contract is clearly 
erroneous.  Doctor Roux even testified as to the invalidity of the major justification put forth by the hospital.  The district court's 
finding leaves this Court with the clear conviction that a mistake has been committed and is, for that reason, set aside."
610,8," This discussion is by no means intended to denigrate the competence of nurse anesthetists. We simply make note of the all too 
common practice of an anesthetist performing services which are later billed by an anesthesiologist."
610,9," Appellees contend that this contract does not stifle competition, but simply places the competition at a different point.  They 
state that anesthesiology groups compete for this contract, and this ensures high quality and reasonable price for the services.  
We make no comment on the merits of this assertion because the hospital, in fact, has not permitted this competition since the 
original contract was signed over ten years ago."
610,10," The fourth element necessary to prove an illegal tying arrangement requires a finding of the amount of interstate commerce 
involved.  A finding that ""a total amount of business, substantial enough in terms of dollar-volume so as not to be merely de 
minimis, is foreclosed to competitors by the tie . . .,"" Fortner Enterprises v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 501, 89 S. "
611,," Ct. 1252, 1258, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969), will satisfy this test.  The director of operating rooms at East Jefferson Hospital testified 
at trial that approximately 875 operations per month were performed at the hospital.  Record on Appeal, vol. 2, at 236.  Even if 
one uses the very conservative figure of $100 for anesthesia services, the sum of commerce foreclosed in a year's time amounts 
to over a million dollars.  The district court recognized that a significant portion of the sum came through the channels of 
interstate commerce.  The court also noted that supplies and medicine for the department are often provided by out-of-state 
sellers. Record on Appeal, vol. 2, at 240-41.  We leave this finding undisturbed."
611,11," In Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918), Justice Brandeis set forth the 
following classic statement of the rule of reason: The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. Id. at 238, 38 S. Ct. at 244."

] courts have declared the following practices unlawful in and of themselves and, therefore, subject to the per se 
rule: price fixing, division of markets, group boycotts, and tying arrangements.  Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). "
612,13," The Court concluded that this argument was more properly directed to Congress: Our adherence to the per se rule is grounded not only on economic prediction, judicial convenience, and business certainty, 
but also on a recognition of the respective roles of the Judiciary and the Congress in regulating the economy.  United 
States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, [405 U.S. 596] at 611-612 [405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126 at 1135, 31 L. Ed. 2d 
515]. Given its generality, our enforcement of the Sherman Act has required the Court to provide much of its substantive 
content.  By articulating the rules of law with some clarity and by adhering to rules that are justified in their general 
application, however, we enhance the legislative prerogative to amend the law.  The respondents' arguments against 
application of the per se rule in this case therefore are better directed to the legislature. Congress may consider the 
exception that we are not free to read into the statute. Id. 102 S. Ct. at 2478-79 (footnote omitted). "
613,14," We concur with the following statement from Sosa v. Board of Managers of Val Verde Hospital, 437 F.2d 173 (5th Cir. 1971), 
about the propriety of judicial restraint where the professional and ethical competence of a physician is concerned. In the instant case there was considerable evidence regarding Dr.  Sosa's ethical and professional competency.  No court 
should substitute its evaluation of such matters for that of the Hospital Board.  It is the Board, not the court, which is 
charged with the responsibility of providing a competent staff of doctors. The Board has chosen to rely on the advice of its 
Medical Staff, and the court cannot surrogate for the Staff in executing this responsibility. Human lives are at stake, and the 
governing board must be given discretion in its selection so that it can have confidence in the competence and moral 
commitment of its staff. Id. at 177. "
618,1," A brief outline of the organizational structure of Booth Hospital follows.  The Board of Trustees sat in New York City and was 
the only entity that could grant or withhold staff privileges.  The Administrator of Booth Hospital, Major Glenn Seiler, answered 
and made recommendations to the Board of Trustees. The Advisory Council was composed of several committees, among 
which was the Medical Administration Committee, whose job included the handling of ""medical and administrative problems."" 
Next came the Medical Staff, which was in charge of medical events and served an advisory role to the Administrator and to the 
Board of Trustees.  The right arm of the Medical Staff was the Executive Committee, which formalized matters to be brought 
before the general staff. This Committee was composed of doctors practicing at Booth Hospital.  The Administrator, who 
attended the Executive Committee meetings, would transmit the minutes of these meetings to the Board of Trustees.  It is the 
minutes of these meetings that comprise the bulk of the exhibits introduced at trial. "
619,2," The crux of Poster is that a reiteration of defendant's refusal to deal constitutes an ""act within the meaning of Zenith . . . . "" Id. at 
127. This view is reconcilable with Garelick, supra, as the subsequent act must still cause damage.  Pioneer Co. Inc. v. Talon, 
Inc., 462 F.2d 1106, 1109 (8th Cir. 1972); Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium v. Mangurian, 549 F.2d 1029, 1035 (5th Cir. 
1977). For an excellent analysis of the ""continuing conspiracy"" theory as it relates to the statute of limitations in anti-trust actions, 
see Imperial, supra, at 1033-42. "
620,3," Western Waste Serv. v. Universal Waste Control, 616 F.2d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 869, 66 L. Ed. 2d 88, 
101 S. Ct. 205 (1980); Feldman v. Jackson Memorial Hosp., 509 F. Supp. 815, 819-21 (S.D. Fla. 1981). The most recent law 
review on the subject rejects this broad reading of McLain on the ground that it would in essence eliminate the interstate 
commerce test from antitrust law since the total activities of virtually any defendant would have some effect upon interstate 
commerce. Antitrust and Hospital Privileges, 70 Calif. L. Rev. 595, 632-33 (1982). The Court notes that the test is whether there 
is ""a not insubstantial effect"" on interstate commerce, ( McLain, supra, at 246) and not whether there is ""some effect"".  
Accordingly, the Court cannot agree with this recent commentary, and accepts instead the interpretation given McLain by law 
review cited in the text above. "
621,4," Were an unreasonable or adverse effect presumed from a showing of a not insubstantial effect upon interstate commerce, the 
Rule of Reason analysis would serve no purpose.  The Court notes that while the Supreme Court has often used the phrase 
""substantial and adverse effect,"" it has done so when faced with a substantive rather than a jurisdictional attack.  For a good 
discussion of the distinction between the substantive and jurisdictional element[s] that have to be proved in a section 1 claim, 
see 15 Ga. L. Rev. 717-28 (1981)."
621,5," This is the majority view for both jurisdictional and substantive purposes, but the basis for using the narrower test for 
jurisdictional purposes has been eroded by McLain, as discussed earlier in this opinion. "
623,6," The evidence reflects that Dr. Siehl attended two meetings in 1973, and that he quit referring patients to plaintiff in 1972 or 
1973.  Although his refusal to deal with plaintiff was concurrent with Drs. Hess' and Heringer's refusals to deal, the absence of 
other factors (existing in the case of Drs. Hess and Heringer) causes the Court to direct a verdict in favor of Dr. Siehl. "
625,7," The Court would characterize the actions of these defendants as decisions of a joint venture between the physicians and the 
hospital.  In antitrust law, the term ""joint venture"" denotes a group of independent economic actors who have joined together, in 
part, to provide a common product or service.  Antitrust and Hospital Privileges, 70 Calif. L. Rev. 595, 657 (1982). In this case, 
the common product or service provided by the joint venture is medical care and supplies to the public.  Joint ventures are 
generally analyzed under the Rule of Reason, and are upheld if there are ""legitimate business reasons"" for the activity.  Id. citing 
Pitofsky, Joint Ventures Under the Antitrust Laws: Some Reflections on the Significance of Penn-Olin, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 1007, 
1018 (1969)."
625,8," It is uncontroverted that Booth Hospital was forced to relocate from Covington to Boone County in order to compete with the 
other community hospitals. "
626,9," In Veizaga v. National Board of Respiratory Therapy, 1977-1 TRADE CASES (CCH) P61,274 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 27, 1977), the 
Court used a two-step analysis in determining which rule applied. First, if the challenged activity is, by its nature and character, 
commercial, the per se rule would apply.  If it were noncommercial, a Rule of Reason analysis would be applied.  Maricopa 
seems to go further and permit Rule of Reason analysis in cases where the restraint is commercial in nature, but is premised on 
public service or ethical norms."
626,10," The evidence does show that some of defendants blamed plaintiff for rising insurance premiums due to his participation in 
medical malpractice actions brought against defendants and other physicians in the area. "
630,1," By a letter agreement dated February 9, 1981, plaintiffs agreed to ""forgo the right to enjoin Gulf from franchise termination at 
either location."" By way of consideration, Gulf agreed to supply plaintiffs with unbranded gasoline until September 30, 1981.  See 
Exhibit 1 to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. "
631,2," It is also undisputed that a large portion of the raw ingredients used in refining the gasoline are shipped to the Philadelphia 
refinery from out of state."
631,3," The proposition that the Clayton Act's jurisdictional reach extends beyond this ""in commerce"" requirement to embrace -- in 
common with the Sherman Act -- all activities having a substantial effect on interstate commerce is one that is not ""without at 
least a measure of support."" Copp, supra, 419 U.S. at 202 and n. 18, 95 S. Ct. at 402 & n. 18 (citing Standard Oil Co. of "
632,," California and Standard Stations v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949)). But the court has 
intimated its strong disapproval of such an ""expansion of the Clayton Act's scope beyond that which the statutory language 
defines."" Id."
632,4," The in commerce requirement common to the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act stands in contrast to the more rigorous 
jurisdictional standard imposed by § 2 of the Clayton Act which requires not only that the purportedly illegal activity take place in 
the course of interstate commerce, but that an actual interstate sale in violation of that section also occur.  Copp 419 U.S. at

635,10," Since the PMPA was intended, inter alia, to prevent arbitrary franchise terminations, see generally Senate Report No. 95-731, 
95th Cong. 2d Session, 15-19, 29-43, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1978, p. 873, it would appear that a strict requirement 
that a franchisee purchase gas each week would run counter to the Act's purpose. "

636,12," See Exhibit 8, pp. 1-2, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment."
636,13," See Exhibit 7, pp. 5, 17, 30, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment."
636,14," This seems especially appropriate inasmuch as Gulf could have modified the terms of their contractual relations with plaintiffs 
under § 2802(b)(3)(A) of the PMPA.  Since Gulf did not, it appears fair to draw such inferences as I have drawn in plaintiffs' 
favor, according plaintiffs, for the purposes of this motion, the broad protection afforded by the ninety day term."
636,15," In the interest of narrowing the issues for trial in this matter -- if trial is necessary, which I strongly believe should not be the 
case -- I think it appropriate to dispose, as a matter of law, of one other argument put forward by plaintiffs under this head.  
Plaintiffs contend that Gulf was under a contractual obligation to give plaintiffs an opportunity to correct any conduct alleged to 
be in violation of the franchises. The notice requirement upon which plaintiffs rely is found in their respective ""Contracts of Sale."" 
Exhibit 7, pp. 1, 8, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The contracts each provide that if the franchisee engages in or 
permits ""any illegal or improper act on or about the premises where Gulf identification is displayed,"" Gulf may terminate the 
franchise if, after written notice, the franchisee fails to discontinue such acts.  Plaintiffs argue that this provision guarantees that 
the franchisee be given an opportunity to cure any failure to meet its contractual terms before Gulf may terminate the franchise. 
But the contract language plainly applies only to situations where the franchisee's conduct threatens to damage Gulf's "
637,," reputation, by associating it with illegal or controversial activity.  It would thus not affect Gulf's right to terminate under the PMPA 
2802(b)(2)(A) for any material breach of a reasonable contractual provision."
637,16," See Exhibit 8, Plaintiffs' Answer to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. "
638,17," To the extent that plaintiffs' complaints and later submissions may be read to claim damages arising from Gulf's refusal to 
honor credit invoices for sales of non-Gulf products other than gasoline, such claims are moot because Gulf never in fact acted 
upon that basis during the period from plaintiffs' first complaint to the franchise terminations. While it asserted a right to so act, 
Gulf was prevented from doing so, first, by an agreement entered into by the parties at the time of the September, 1980 hearing 
on plaintiffs' T.R.O. application, and then by my preliminary injunction of November 17, 1980."
638,18," In opposing Gulf's motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs have submitted no further briefing nor any additional evidence in 
support of these claims."
638,19," See Guyer v. Cities Service Co., 381 F. Supp. 7 (E.D.Wisc.1974). "
643,1," As originally instituted, the litigation involved charges of a vertical antitrust conspiracy, patent misuse, patent validity and 
infringement and nonpayment of royalties. These aspects of the case have all either been finally decided or superseded by the 
finding of the horizontal conspiracy. "
644,2," In the instant case, the fact of damage, an essential ingredient to a showing of antitrust liability, was conclusively established in 
the liability phase of the trial.  We are concerned now only with the measure of actual damages."
644,3," When this litigation began, Madison was Burlington's wholly-owned subsidiary. During the litigation Madison was merged into 
Burlington. "
645,4," Defendants offered to substantiate this theory by showing that if Leesona had lost its right to collect royalties, it would have 
increased the lump-sum purchase price for its machines, because ""the price of our machinery has always been a combination of 
machine price and royalty""; that Leesona could have collected royalties on other patents even if the patents safeguarded by the 
conspiratorial settlement had been invalidated; that market demand was so strong that Leesona could have raised prices by as 
much as 20%; that DMRC could have exacted a premium even if Leesona's patents had been invalidated, since DMRC's 
machines were cheaper to operate than those of Leesona and therefore supported a higher royalty; that DMRC and Chavanoz 
could have extracted paid-up royalties to replace production royalties, in which case Whitin would have been forced to raise its 
prices; and that price increases by defendants would not have induced substantial foreign competition. "
646,5," We, of course, have no occasion to pass on the admissibility or persuasiveness of particular items of evidence contained in 
defendants' proffer.  Those are matters for the district court to decide on remand. "
647,6," In Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968), the opinion for 
the Court indicated that the in pari delicto defense is unavailable in antitrust litigation.  See id. at 140. Five concurring and 
dissenting Justices, however, either rejected this view or accepted it only with substantial qualification.  Under the concurring 
and dissenting opinions in Perma Life Mufflers, this circuit continues to recognize a narrow version of the defense.  See 
Columbia Nitrogen Corp., 451 F.2d at 15-16. See also 15 J. von Kalinowski, supra, § 109.02 (taking the view that the in pari 
delicto defense remains viable after Perma Life Mufflers). But see Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 
102 S. Ct. 1935, 1943-1944, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 341-42 (1982) (citing Perma Life Mufflers for the proposition that broad common-
law defenses should not be permitted to hamper private rights of action under the antitrust laws). "
650,7," Plaintiffs argue that if any set-off for support services was appropriate, the deduction should have been made after trebling the 
damages.  This argument, however, is inconsistent with the basic premise that plaintiffs cannot claim injury to the extent that 
they received value in exchange for the royalty payments. "
651,8," This methodology and its rationale were cogently summarized in Wainwright v. Kraftco Corp., 58 F.R.D. 9 (N.D. Ga. 1973): An antitrust plaintiff may choose to sue but one of several co-conspirators, and that one co-conspirator will be responsible 
for the entire amount of damages caused by all.  Of course an antitrust plaintiff may not recover double payment, and if 
during a case an antitrust plaintiff recovers an item of damage from one co-conspirator through a release he may not 
recover that same item later from another co-conspirator still in the case. This does not, however, diminish the responsibility 
of each co-conspirator for the entire amount of damages.  Thus if an antitrust plaintiff sues four co-conspirators alleging 
$100,000 damages, and during the suit three of the co-conspirators are released upon a total payment of $50,000, and the 
jury returns a verdict assessing damages at $100,000, as a matter of computation the remaining co-conspirator is liable for 
the entire amount of damages trebled -- $300,000 -- and his defense of payment will result only in a deduction of $50,000 
from the trebled amount, leaving him with a liability of $250,000. Id. at 12 (citations omitted). "
653,9," Indeed, defendants' claim reduction theory clashes directly with the Zenith decision.  The Zenith Court held that HN8[
] when 
an antitrust conspirator settles with a plaintiff and obtains a release, the release does not insulate co-conspirators from liability 
unless the parties to the settlement so intend.  401 U.S. at 347. This rule was adopted to promote partial settlements of antitrust 
cases involving multiple parties.  See id. It is undisputed here that, in entering into the Leesona settlement, plaintiffs expressly 
reserved their right to proceed against defendants.  Yet the district court disregarded plaintiffs' intent and ruled, in effect, that the 
settlement relieved defendants of joint and several liability. To allow the district court's decision to stand would scuttle the policy 
articulated in Zenith by giving antitrust plaintiffs a powerful incentive to avoid partial settlements. "
654,1," Robert Leesona, president of Leesona, convinced Norman Armitage, an officer of DMRC, that the Whitin litigation should be 
settled, saying, ""There is more at stake than the cost of a suit.  If you win, you lose, and if you lose, you lose -- because if the 
patent is broken, there will be no royalty."" 444 F. Supp. at 680. "
655,2," Thus, Burlington was faced with the same sort of choice which would precipitate the Whitin settlement. See footnote 1 and 
accompanying text."
655,3," Leesona raised an estoppel defense, but the case was settled before that issue could be fully aired."
655,4," Burlington asserted claims in the MDL-82 litigation aggregating $26,000,000, but released Leesona for $789,683. In this case, 
Burlington claims damages based on the royalty payments to Leesona (after subtracting the amount received from settling the In 
Re Yarn Processing case), amounting to $13,439,793.72. "
660,1," This litigation began on October 15, 1976, when Westinghouse Electric Corp. filed a complaint against twelve foreign and 
seventeen domestic corporations engaged in various aspects of the uranium industry, alleging the existence of an international 
cartel. TVA subsequently filed three separate lawsuits with allegations paralleling Westinghouse's in the Eastern District of 
Tennessee, the Southern District of New York, and the District of Colorado, which were consolidated with the Westinghouse 
case.  Westinghouse has since settled its case, and TVA has settled all its claims save those made against Gulf in the Eastern 
District of Tennessee. "
661,2, Judge Higginbotham dissented.
661,3," For reasons that are unclear, Gulf also relies heavily on Montreal Trading, Ltd. v. Amax, Inc., 661 F.2d 864 (10th Cir. 1981), 
cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1001, 102 S. Ct. 1634, 71 L. Ed. 2d 868 (1982), a case entirely irrelevant to the issue at hand.  There, the 
plaintiff sought to recover overcharges although it had never actually purchased any noncompetitively priced items.  The court 
noted that proof that the plaintiff would have purchased items but for the unlawful overcharge was necessarily speculative and 
created Illinois Brick problems.  However, the situation here is much different, since TVA did purchase allegedly overpriced 
uranium. In any event, the entire discussion Gulf relies on is dictum; the holding of the case was that the complaint alleged 
insufficient contacts with the United States to justify federal jurisdiction over the claim."
661,4," To the extent it matters, it appears that TVA is correct to argue that the complaint does allege a ""boycott."" The complaint 
alleges that cartel members refused to bid on TVA contracts unless TVA agreed to pay the cartel's prices.  It has long been clear 
that a refusal to deal with the plaintiff unless he capitulates to the defendants' terms is a potentially unlawful boycott under the 
Sherman Act.  See, e.g., St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 543-45, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 
(1978). The fact that the plaintiff is not a competitor of the defendants is irrelevant.  Id. "
662,5," See generally Berger & Bernstein, An Analytical Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 809 (1977). See also In re Beef 
Industry Antitrust Litigation, 542 F. Supp. 1122 (N.D. Tex. 1982). "
663,6," Mid-West contains nothing inconsistent with this conclusion.  To the contrary, the court focused on the difficulties in determining 
what prices would have been charged in the absence of a cartel by those in competition with the cartel. Those problems are 
absent when the overcharges are paid to members of the cartel whose prices are set by the cartel."
663,7," We must confess, however, that Gulf's memoranda are sufficiently unclear so that we are unsure whether Gulf has taken the 
position we have ascribed to it.  In its motion for partial summary judgment, Gulf does not appear to seek dismissal of claims 
related to overcharges paid to nondefendant coconspirators.  See Motion of Gulf Oil Corporation and Gulf Minerals Canada, Ltd. 
for Partial Summary Judgment (Seeking dismissal of ""TVA's price-fixing claims as insufficient as a matter of law, except those 
based on purchases from a defendant or proven co-conspirator at prices affected by the alleged conspiracy."").  However, in its 
memorandum, Gulf appears to seek dismissal of claims involving payments to members of the alleged conspiracy solely 
because they are nondefendants. See Memorandum In Support of Motion of Gulf Oil Corporation and Gulf Minerals Canada, 
Ltd. for Partial Summary Judgment at 25 (Seeking dismissal of certain overcharge claims because they involve ""suppliers [that] 
are not defendants."")."
663,8," A careful reading of the Second Circuit's opinion in the Kennecutt Copper case reveals that the court did not adopt Mid-West's 
blanket prohibition on recovery for overcharges paid to nonconspirators. Rather, the court of appeals' opinion rests on narrower 
grounds.  In Kennecutt Copper, the defendants had conspired to keep the price they charged for domestically refined copper 
artificially low, in order to protect long-term sales.  Since this scheme resulted in consumers of domestically refined copper 
saving money, plaintiff alleged that the scheme caused the price of copper scrap to increase, since consumers used their 
savings to ""bid up"" the price of scrap.  Plaintiff never purchased any domestically refined copper from defendants, but sought 
recovery for alleged scrap overcharges paid to nonconspirators because of the cartel's pricing policy.  The court of appeals did 
not embrace the district court's per se rule against recovery for overcharges paid to nonconspirators. Rather, it held that the 
problem of tracing the effects of an undercharge between two separate markets were insurmountable. See id. at 13-14.  Here, 
no similar problems exist, since no elaborate tracing between markets is required; the parties agree only one market is present 
here.  See Strax v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 524 F. Supp. 936, 939-40 (S.D.N.Y. 1981)."
663,9," Commentators have also criticized Mid-West. See Page, Antitrust Damages and Economic Efficiency: An Approach to Antitrust 
Injury, 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 467, 478-80 (1980); Case Comment, Standing of Purchasers from Nonconspirators to Challenge Price- "
664,," Fixing Conspiracy: Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 93 Harv. L. Rev. 598 (1980). But see Note, 
Monopsonistic Price Fixing and Umbrella Pricing as a Theory of Antitrust Standing: A New View of Illinois Brick, 50 U. Cinn. L. 
Rev. 52 (1981)."
664,10," In this case, we sit as a United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, and are bound by the decisions of 
the Sixth Circuit. The only authority either party suggests is controlling in the Sixth Circuit on this question is Malamud v. Sinclair 
Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1149-50 (6th Cir. 1975), in which the court adopted the ""zone of interests"" test for antitrust standing, 
according antitrust plaintiffs standing if they have suffered injury in fact and arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by 
the antitrust laws. TVA suggests Malamud is inconsistent with Mid-West qPaper. However, Mid-West Paper addresses an 
entirely different problem than does Malamud. Malamud addresses the question of antitrust injury under § 4 of the Clayton Act. 
The problems addressed in Illinois Brick are ""analytically distinct"" from the standing questions addressed in Malamud. See 431 
U.S. at 728 n. 7."
664,11," Moreover, Illinois Brick even manages to compensate indirect purchasers; they receive relief in the form of lower prices 
charged by direct purchasers as a result of their ability to sue in antitrust. See Landes & Posner, Should Indirect Purchasers 
Have Standing To Sue Under the Antitrust Laws: An Economic Analysis of Illinois Brick, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 602, 605-08 (1979). "
665,12, A model for economic behavior in such a market is provided in the appendix attached hereto.
665,13," Moreover, HN8[
] once it is established that TVA has been injured by Gulf's anticompetitive conduct, the amount of damage, 
i.e., the difference between the price charged and the price that would have been charged but for the conduct, need not be 
established with absolute precision; it need only be reasonably estimated.  See, e.g., Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 
Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 339-42, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971); Zenith Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114-
25, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969); Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 90 L. Ed. 652, 66 S. Ct. 574 
(1946); Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562-66, 75 L. Ed. 544, 51 S. Ct. 248 (1931). Gulf 
erroneously argues TVA may not recover damages for overcharges to be incurred in the future, under long term contracts.  The 
above cases demonstrate that future damages may be recovered if they can be reasonably estimated. "
666,14," In another of their frolic and detours, the parties engage in an elaborate argument as to whether the cartel's refusal to bid on 
TVA contracts is somehow protected by the actions of the Atomic Energy Commission (""AEC""), now the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission.  Beginning in 1964, the AEC had imposed a virtual embargo against the importation of uranium into the United 
States.  In 1974, the AEC proposed a relaxation of the embargo, which would be phased in gradually, and become fully effective 
in 1984.  Gulf argues that the reason members of the international cartel did not bid on TVA contracts was because the AEC 
embargo prohibited sales to TVA, rather than as part of a price-fixing scheme.  If Gulf is arguing that the AEC's actions can 
provide it with some sort of exemption from the scrutiny of the antitrust laws, we have grave doubts about the correctness of its 
position.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2135(a) (1976) (§ 105 of the Atomic Energy Act, which provides that ""Nothing contained in this 
chapter shall relieve any person from the operation of"" the antitrust laws.).  However, we do not understand Gulf to make this 
argument.  See Supplemental Reply Brief of Gulf and GMCL in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 1-2.  Rather, 
it appears that Gulf is arguing that the cartel's conduct was not part of an anticompetitive scheme, but merely the inevitable 
result of the AEC's embargo. TVA, for its part, introduces material indicating that the refusal to bid on TVA's contracts was part 
of a scheme to have the embargo lifted and the domestic market penetrated by the cartel. Other material indicates that the cartel 
was willing to bid on domestic contracts despite the embargo, albeit at fixed prices.  This evidence creates a classic issue of fact 
as to the purpose and effect of the cartel's actions with respect to TVA which can only be resolved at trial. "

670,1," A more complete history of this lengthy litigation may be found in three earlier decisions in this case.  See Continental T.V., Inc. 
v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 37-42, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977); GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Continental T.V., 
Inc., 537 F.2d 980, 982-86 (9th Cir. 1976) (en banc); Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 461 F. Supp. 1046, 1047-48 
(N.D. Cal. 1978). "
671,2," In Schwinn, the Court considered a vertical restriction that applied to both sale and non-sale, i.e., consignment transactions.  
388 U.S. at 371. The Court held that the vertical restriction that applied to Schwinn's sale transaction was per se unlawful.  Id. at 
380. The Court also held that the vertical restriction that applied to Schwinn's non-sale transactions was reasonable.  Id. at 381-
82. See section IV. B. 2 infra."
671,3," The jury found for the defendant on Continental's claim that Sylvania had conspired to restrain trade through a combination of 
location restrictions and price-fixing. The jury also found for Sylvania on Continental's state law claims."
671,4," The court explicitly distinguished between vertical price restrictions and vertical nonprice restrictions, indicating that a per se 
rule would continue to apply to the former.  433 U.S. at 51 n.18."
671,5," HN1[
] There must be no genuine disputes as to material facts and, on the undisputed facts, the movant must be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); SEC v. Seaboard Corp., 677 F.2d 1301, 1305-06 (9th Cir. 1982); Crown 
Beverage Co. v. Cerveceria Moctezuma, S.A., 663 F.2d 886, 888 (9th Cir. 1981); United States v. First National Bank, 652 F.2d 
882, 887 (9th Cir. 1981); Ramirez v. National Distillers & Chemical Corp., 586 F.2d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir. 1978). Although the Supreme Court has indicated that summary judgment should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation, Poller 
v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), the Court has approved its 
use, see First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289-90, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968); see 
also ALW Inc. v. United Air Lines, Inc., 510 F.2d 52, 54-55 (9th Cir. 1975). "
672,," We note also that summary judgment has been granted in this circuit on a record much more sparse than this one in a post-
Sylvania case involving a claim of antitrust violation based on a location clause.  Golden Gate Acceptance Corp. v. General 
Motors Corp., 597 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1979). Because of the lengthy trial, the record before us is rather complete and entirely 
adequate to allow review of the district court's grant of summary judgment. Nevertheless, Sylvania's motion, which merely cited 
to the entire trial record, has not greatly aided us in our review.  A court might well be warranted in rejecting such a shotgun 
approach, although we, and the district court, have elected to make the necessary review of the record in this case."
672,6," We disregard Continental's contentions that it should be allowed to retry the case under a per se theory arguably applicable to 
resale price maintenance claims and horizontal allocation or boycott claims.  As to the former, the special jury verdict on this 
claim, decided against Continental, was not appealed.  As to the latter, Continental made no such allegations in its original case.  
It cannot do so now. "
673,7," The Supreme Court explained that HN4[
] vertical restraints can be used by an established manufacturer ""to induce retailers 
to engage in promotional activities or to provide service and repair facilities necessary to the efficient marketing of its product."" 
Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 55. The court went on to state that ""because of market imperfections such as the so-called 'free rider' 
effect, these services might not be provided by retailers in a purely competitive situation, despite the fact that each retailer's 
benefit would be greater if all provided the service than if none did."" Id. See generally R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic 
Perspective 147-166 (1976); Note, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. -- An Economic Approach to Antitrust Analysis, 8 
Mem. St. U.L. Rev. 565, 588-89 (1978)."
673,8," For purposes of its summary judgment motion, Sylvania conceded that there was a conspiracy between it and Handy Andy at 
the time Continental requested permission to enter the Sacramento market."
673,9," An airtight restriction would exist if the location clause preventing Sylvania dealers from selling Sylvania goods from other than 
authorized locations were coupled with an exclusive franchise arrangement whereby Sylvania promised Handy Andy not to 
authorize any other dealer to sell in the Sacramento area.  Or, indeed, other proscriptions would have been even more 
restrictive, such as limiting the competing products the Sylvania dealer could sell or limiting customers to residents of the 
territory.  See Zelek, Stern, and Dunfree, A Rule of Reason Decision Model After Sylvia, 68 Calif. L. Rev. 13, 34 (1980). Whether 
an airtight territorial restriction would be treated differently than a non-airtight restriction, is a question we need not decide.  See 
generally Pitofsky, The Sylvania Case: Antitrust Analysis of Non-Price Vertical Restrictions, 78 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 34 (1978) 
(arguing that a per se rule should be applied to airtight territorial restrictions)."
673,10," Both Eiberger and Cernuto involved the termination of distributorships by product manufacturers. Although vertical in form, 
these restraints were held unlawful primarily because they constituted a means for enforcing an essentially horizontal system of 
price control among distributors. The Cernuto court expressly grounded its imposition of antitrust liability on an observation that 
""although we are confronted here with an apparently vertical conspiracy, the principal impact of that conspiracy . . . is horizontal 
rather than vertical in nature."" 595 F.2d at 167 n. 15. It reasoned that ""if the action of a manufacturer or other supplier is taken at 
the discretion of its customer, the restraint becomes primarily horizontal in nature in that one customer is seeking to suppress its 
competition by utilizing the power of a common supplier."" Id. at 168. No similar elements of horizontal price-fixing appear in the present case, which we instead analyze under the more lenient test 
applied to purely vertical territorial restraints. "
674,11," We do not require that a restriction be the least restrictive alternative available in order to be reasonable.  Such a rule would 
place an unreasonable and impractical burden on a manufacturer desiring to impose some vertical restraint in order to promote 
its position vis a vis its competitors.  The restraint adopted by Sylvania in this case, as noted by the Supreme Court, was ""neither 
the least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have used."" Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 58 n.29."
674,12," Although not dispositive, the exclusive dealership precedents, see Sylvania, 537 F.2d at 997 (and cases cited therein), 
support the proposition that it is not unreasonable for a manufacturer to refuse to allow a specific retailer to market the 
manufacturer's products.  Continental argues that these precedents must be reconsidered in light of Sylvania. See generally 
Elias, Dealer Termination or Exclusion, Intrabrand Competition and GTE Sylvania, 29 Baylor L. Rev. 435 (1977). However, this 
court has continued to rely on the exclusive dealership precedents even after the Sylvania decision.  See Chandler Supply Co. v. 
GAF Corp., 650 F.2d 983, 989 (9th Cir. 1981); Golden Gate Acceptance Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 597 F.2d at 678."
674,13," In reaching its conclusion the Court considered the following: (1) that other competitive bicycles are available to distributors and retailers in the marketplace, and there is no showing that 
they are not in all respects reasonably interchangeable as articles of competitive commerce with the Schwinn product; (2) 
that Schwinn distributors and retailers handle other brands of bicycles as well as Schwinn's; (3) in the present posture of "
675,," the case we cannot rule that the vertical restraints are unreasonable because of their intermixture with price fixing; and (4) 
we cannot disagree with the findings of the trial court that competition made necessary the challenged program; that it was 
justified by, and went no further than required by, competitive pressures; and that its net effect is to preserve and not to 
damage competition in the bicycle market.  Schwinn, 338 U.S. at 381-82 (footnote omitted)."
675,14," Although the court was reviewing a trial court's decision to award judgment notwithstanding the verdict on a state antitrust 
claim, the court applied federal antitrust principles.  Red Diamond Supply, Inc., 637 F.2d at 1003."
675,15," Sylvania adopted a new marketing policy in 1962, which included use of the location clause arrangement.  Continental 
attempted to enter the Sacramento market and was terminated by Sylvania in 1965.  There is nothing in the record indicating 
that the structure of the television manufacturing industry, as opposed to the demand for television sets, changed between 1962 
and 1965."
675,16," We do not wish to suggest that the purpose of a manufacturer in adopting a vertical restraint is dispositive.  Cf.  Borger v. 
Yamaha International Corp., 625 F.2d 390, 397 n.4 (2d Cir. 1980) (indicating that absent evidence of anti-competitive effect 
resulting from adoption of a vertical restraint, evidence of an anti-competitive purpose in adopting the restraint would not be 
sufficient).  Obviously, evidence of the reasons why a restraint was adopted is likely to be self-serving.  See Pitofsky, supra, note 
9, at 35 (""The primary problem with evidence of purpose -- to put the matter bluntly -- is that in modern antitrust cases, such 
evidence will often reflect what counsel advise businessmen their purpose should have been."").  Nevertheless, where, as here, 
Sylvania did not adopt the restraint to eliminate price discounters, and was struggling to increase its market share, we can 
assume that Sylvania thought adoption of the restraint was reasonably necessary to promote its competition with other brands. "
679,1," Serta, Inc.'s arguments relating to an incomplete record were fully considered.  The merits of its objections are noted in the text 
of this Opinion, as relevant.  Specifically, Serta, Inc. complains that (1) Rowe's Proposed Finding No. 76, of a less restrictive 
trademark protection plan than the resolution passed, is based on a draft manual entitled ""Trademark Program of Serta, Inc.,"" 
which was not offered into evidence; (2) Proposed Finding No. 95 and 96 and Proposed Conclusion No. 3, that Serta, Inc., by its 
resolution violates a previously entered consent decree, is based on the Final Consent of Judgment in United States v. Serta 
Associates, Inc.  296 F. Supp. 1121 (N.D. Ill. 1968), aff'd 393 U.S. 534 rehearing denied 394 U.S. 967 (1969), which was not 
offered into evidence and of which the Court was not asked to take judicial notice; and (3) Proposed Conclusion No. 3, that there 
is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits when the resolution is tested by the rule of reason, is improper because 
Rowe did not argue its case under the rule of reason nor introduce evidence on the nature and extent of the relevant market or 
the nature and degree of the competition allegedly foreclosed. "
680,2," Although Honorblit maufactured and sold Serta-identified sleeper sofas in 1980, it no longer does so."
680,3," Although the record is lean regarding the circumstances, Lounge, Inc. apparently was selling sleeper sofas with Serta mattress 
inserts in the Philadelphia area in 1980.  Mr. Moore worried that Lounge was attempting to pass off its less expensive product as 
a product made entirely by Serta.  By Fall of 1981, Rowe was the only nonlicensee selling sleeper sofas with Serta mattress 
inserts. "
694,*," Judge Nichols was an Associate Judge of the United States Court of Claims when this case was argued. He was sitting by 
designation. On October 1, 1982, he became a member of the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit, with the title of Circuit Judge, by various provisions of Pub. L. No. 97-164."
694,1," After the oral argument in this case, Judge Will entered judgment on plaintiff's attorney fee and cost claims under 15 U.S.C. § 
15. An appeal from that decision has now been docketed in this Court (No. 82-2183).  Although it is our general practice to 
consolidate merits and fee appeals, we see no purpose in delaying the resolution of the merits case here. The fee appeal will be 
assigned to a randomly selected panel of this Court according to our usual procedures. "
697,2," Although the terminology is used variously, we adopt ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" for the parent-subsidiary model and reserve 
""intracorporate conspiracy"" for the situation where a division is alleged to have conspired with its own corporation. "

698,5," Id. at 729. Note, however, that the Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 34-35 
(1955) would differentiate between parent-subsidiary pricing or distribution decisions (no liability) and agreements that have a 
""coercive [effect on] the trade of strangers to the corporate family"" (liability). This case falls in the latter category. See also 
Section of Antitrust Law of the American Bar Ass'n, Antitrust Developments 1955-1968, at 19-22 (1968)."
698,6," Handler and Smart, op. cit. (note 3 supra) at 25."
698,7," Economies of scale are the main reason for integration, whether it is full or partial. The choice between partial integration (the 
parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary) and full integration (the corporation and its divisions) may be dictated by a desire to (1) 
save taxes (not a ""real"" efficiency), (2) maintain the good will associated with the subsidiary, (3) have some decentralization of 
production, distribution or management, (4) enhance a particular part of the enterprise in capital markets, or (5) minimize the 
effect of protective legislation against foreign corporations.  See 75 Mich. L. Rev. at 728 & n. 71."

International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-142, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981: ""Since respondents Midas and International 
availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not 
save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities."""
698,9," See the survey in Handler and Smart, op. cit. (note 3 supra) at 40-61. The author of 95 Harv. L. Rev. 661 (note 3 supra) 
concedes (at 676) that ""Supreme Court precedent precludes the lower courts from considering * * * if concerted action by related 
corporations should ever be considered a conspiracy under section 1"" (emphasis added). "
699,10," See, e.g., Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581 (8th Cir. 1981); Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795 (9th Cir. 1976), 
certiorari denied, 433 U.S. 910, 97 S. Ct. 2977, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1094."
699,11," Independence contends that Copperweld's and Regal's trial attorneys (who are not representing them in the appeal) 
acquiesced in all the instructions to which objection is now made (Br. 33-37). The effect of such acquiescence under Rule 51 of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would be to remove from our consideration any error in the jury charge that was not ""plain 
error [resulting] in a miscarriage of justice."" 5A  Moore's Federal Practice para. 51.04, esp. 51-15 (1982)."
699,12," Judge Will's post-trial order (App. 228-293, esp. 240-243) dealt extensively with the claimed instructional defects -- an 
indication that the defendants' objections were sufficient. This same issue recurs elsewhere in this appeal, and we have 
generally resolved ambiguities in defendants' favor. See Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 255-256, 69 L. Ed. 2d 
616, 101 S. Ct. 2748. "
700,13," For example, the reference to ""separate bank accounts"" and ""separate records"" (#7) though ""ostensibly neutral, * * * is actually 
heavily weighted against defendants"" (Br. 34). ""Item 8 [whether both companies were separate participants in the alleged 
unlawful activity] * * * invited the jury to find capacity on the ground that employees of both Copperweld and Regal were 
allegedly active"" (id.). The reference to ""day-to-day operations"" (actually the instruction mentioned both day-to-day and policy 
decisions) is ""rightly disregarded [in Photovest] as an irrelevant factor (id.). Finally, the invitation to consider ""any other facts"" 
relevant to capacity is considered authorization for ""the jury to substitute its own notions about capacity for the standards set by 
this Court."" (Id. at 35)."
700,14," This is the standard for directing a verdict [i.e., removing a case from the jury] and for entering judgment notwithstanding the 
verdict [i.e., overriding the jury's decision], Fact Concerts, supra, 626 F.2d at 1064, vacated Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 
U.S. 247, 69 L. Ed. 2d 616, 101 S. Ct. 2748; 5A Moore's Federal Practice para. 50.07[2] at 50-76 to 50-83 (1982). It is also the 
standard for appellate review, 5A Moore's Federal Practice para. 50.07[2] at 50-83; cf.  Gray v. General Motors Corp., 434 F.2d 
110 (8th Cir. 1970). The standard for granting a new trial is broader (a partial catalog of permissible reasons appears in 6A Moore's Federal Practice 
para. 59.08[1] (1982)) because any retrial is also to a jury and because such judicial control over jury verdict had existed at 
common law, Id., para. 59.04[2]. But appellate review is limited to abuse of discretion. Here the district court's denial of the new 
trial motion is before us because it is merged with the final judgment, but we find no abuse of discretion. "
701,15," The situation is thus not similar to, and there was no error in Judge Will's different treatment of, Yoder's breach of the tubing 
mill contract (Def. Br. 43, n. 15). Judge Will refused to admit defendants' evidence about Yoder's state of mind in May 1973 on 
the issue of what Yoder did, or why, in February of that year. The only questions relevant to Yoder's breach of contract (a more 
discrete event than a conspiracy) were those contemplated in the Uniform Commercial Code: (1) whether a contract had been "
702,," formed, an issue Judge Will resolved as a matter of law; (2) whether Yoder became insecure after receiving the Copperweld 
letter, sought assurances from Independence, and did not receive them (UCC 2-609); and (3) whether Grohne failed in his duty 
to disclose to Yoder the existence of basic facts (UCC 1-203, 2-302). The defendants ' proffered evidence was not relevant to 
any of the dispositive questions."
702,16," Independence's suit is a far cry from the curious allegations in Brunswick. There the antitrust plaintiffs argued that Brunswick, 
by taking over the operation of financially shaky bowling alleys rather than allowing them to fold, had deprived plaintiffs of the 
profits they could have earned if the bowling-alley market had been less competitive."
702,17," Here the exclusion was total, but for a limited time. "
703,18," Here the necessary facility or resource was the steel tubing mill, which the defendants persuaded Yoder not to supply. See the 
discussion of damages, Part V infra."
703,19," There is some sentiment in the scholarly commentary that all antitrust violations involving a parent and a subsidiary as 
conspirators should be subject to Rule of Reason analysis, even where the conduct at issue (e.g., price-fixing, certain boycotts, 
certain tying arrangements) would otherwise be classified per se violation. See, e.g., Comment, Corporate Liability for Intra-
Corporate Conspiracy in Restraint of Trade, 1968 U.Ill.L.F. 248, 253. That approach is certainly salutary where the capacity to 
conspire is presumed on the strength of formally separate corporate identities. We have not yet had sufficient experience with 
Photovest's more pragmatic approach to the capacity problem to know whether the Rule of Reason is also needed here as a 
prophylactic against unduly expansive antitrust liability. This case was not decided on a per se basis."
703,20," Contrary to the impression in Defendants' Brief (46-47) Judge Will's ""impatient"" remarks quoted there did not ""forbid"" closing 
argument and instructions on market share. The issue was the admissibility of a summary exhibit (prepared by the defendants' 
trial counsel), and Judge Will was speaking out of the jury's presence (Indep. Br. 51-52). Defendants did present evidence about 
market share, so that the summary exhibit would have been, at best, cumulative (App. 258-259)."
703,21," The cases on which the defendants rely are of this type: Havoco, supra (actual competitor allegedly harmed); Kaplan v. 
Burroughs Corp., 611 F.2d 286 (9th Cir. 1979), certiorari denied, 447 U.S. 924, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 100 S. Ct. 3016 (actual 
competitor allegedly driven out of business); Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. Omark Industries, 576 F.2d 83 (5th Cir. 1978), 
certiorari denied, 439 U.S. 1116, 59 L. Ed. 2d 75, 99 S. Ct. 1021 (terminated distributor claiming per se violation of antitrust 
laws). In these circumstances before-and-after market share figures will give some indication whether the antitrust plaintiff is 
simply an inefficient firm whose place has been taken by a more efficient one or whether the relevant market is becoming less 
competitive. "
704,22," There was accordingly no error, even if defendants preserved their objections to the instructions (cf. Independence Br. 52 and 
App. 258-261 with notes 11 and 12 supra) and were deterred by Judge Will's remarks from arguing their theory in closing, since 
their theory was wrong in these circumstances."
704,23," Their claim that the instruction on the identity of damages under that count and the antitrust count prejudiced them is 
discussed in Part V infra. Defendants apparently do not contest bringing together Regal's liability for statements made to Deere 
and improper interference with Independence's and Deere's relationship."
704,24," The doctrine takes its name from two Supreme Court cases: Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523, and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 
626, 85 S. Ct. 1585. It shields concerted efforts to influence public officials [including those in courts and administrative 
agencies] from antitrust liability. It does not shield all concerted activity that is allegedly taken with an eye toward litigation. See 
Judge Will's discussion, App. 237-240."
704,25," ""The privilege [is] to take steps to safeguard one's own legal interests, even though they may interfere with another's 
contractual rights"" (Def. Br. 51)."
704,26," Copperweld argues that Hahn & Clay v. A.O. Smith Corp., 320 F.2d 166, 169 (5th Cir. 1963), certiorari denied, 375 U.S. 944, 
11 L. Ed. 2d 274, 84 S. Ct. 351, and Dinkins v. General Aniline & Film Corp., 214 F. Supp. 276, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) show that 
the claimed legal right can be nonexistent. That is an overstatement of those cases. They indicate rather that the legal claim 
must be colorable, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful. In Hahn & Clay, Smith's employees had signed covenants not to use 
Smith's trade secrets. At the time Smith notified various people of its rights, its employees were working for Hahn & Clay and "
705,," Hahn & Clay and Smith were bidding for the same contract. In Dinkins the employee was a former GAF president who had 
signed a contract with a non-compete term, but proposed to act as a consultant for GAF and one of its main competitors 
simultaneously. Thus in each case the privilege claimant could point to some specific source of his legal right. Copperweld's 
claimed rights are much vaguer and more conclusory."
705,27," App. 165: ""[This issue] about the letters is in the antitrust claim and is also applicable or involved in the later alleged improper 
inducement by Copperweld to Yoder to breach its contract with Independence."" Cf. App. 181 (instructing on the tortious 
interference with Yoder count): ""We have been through this, but I will repeat it here because it is relevant here."" The jury had the 
instructions during its deliberations (App. 190) and could refer to both passages. "
706,28," See, e.g., the advice from Copperweld's counsel (June 7, 1973) (App. 636): ""There is not much we can do until [Grohne] starts 
to operate or solicit customers, other than make known our intentions which has already been done. He should therefore be kept 
under continued surveillance and once he starts to operate or solicit customers we should pounce on him."""
706,29," App. 760-777: May 5, 1974 letter to Copperweld from lawyer retained as expert in trade secret law, indicating that Regal had 
taken no steps whatsoever until then to give itself any protectible interest in its employees, its customer lists, or any other 
information. Cf. App. 677: General understanding in industry that manufacture of steel tubing involves no trade secrets, 
employees frequently change jobs among competing firms, and everybody knows who the buyers of steel tubing are."
706,30," Contrary to defendants' argument (Reply Br. 21-23 + n.18) the presence of ""confidential stamps"" on Regal documents does 
not establish confidentiality.  United States Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, 665 F.2d 781 (7th Cir. 1981) (en banc), on 
which defendants rely, only says that a proprietary legend, supported by other facts indicative of ownership, can, if unrebutted, 
lead to summary judgment on a misappropriation claim. This is not a misappropriation case, and ownership and confidentiality 
are not identical concepts. "
707,31," Well after the hirings, Copperweld's legal expert wrote: Little or no security has been maintained even with regard to those specific matters that could legitimately be considered as 
confidential to the company. Thus, there is relatively open access to the plant and to files; there are no sign-in or sign-out 
procedures; none of the plant areas are marked as ""restricted"" and few documents are marked as ""confidential,"" there are 
no inhibitions on copying or removing documents, etc. Moreover, the company has issued no instructions to nor obtained 
any agreements from its employees that they will not disclose information when their employment terminates, nor does it 
have any agreements with key employees restricting their future competition. App. 768. "
708,32, The bracketed language in this verdict form and the one that follows went to the jury.
708,33," Defendants have preserved the issue by appealing both the instruction and the amount of antitrust damages. On the liability 
point, they could have been treated as having waived it by failing to raise the same arguments in the antitrust context as they did 
in their appeal of liability for tortious interference with the Yoder contract. We have not held them to a waiver. "
709,34," As Judge Will noted, Rhodes v. Sigler, 44 Ill. App. 3d 375, 357 N.E.2d 846, 2 Ill. Dec. 626 (3d Dist. 1976), contains only weak 
dictum; and Tonchen v. All-Steel Equipment, Inc., 13 Ill. App. 3d 454, 300 N.E.2d 616 (2d Dist. 1973), reversed damages for 
lack of evidence, not for unrecoverability as a matter of law (App. 284). Defendants' other cases are Illinois Appellate Court 
decisions from 1932 and 1908."
709,35," See, e.g., John D. Copanos & Sons, Inc. v. McDade Rigging and Steel Erection Co., 43 Md. App. 204, 403 A.2d 402 (1979); 
Perma Research & Development Co. v. Singer Co., 402 F. Supp. 881 (S.D.N.Y. 1975), affirmed, 542 F.2d 111 (2d Cir. 1976),

709,36," Defendants assert in n.28 of their principal brief and n.21 of their reply brief that the evidence did not support an award of 
$15,000 against Regal. However, the evidence showed that Regal salesman Harry Bishop told Doris Lang, an assistant Deere 
buyer for structural steel tubing, that Independence was not a reliable source of tubing because it was in financial trouble, unable 
to borrow money or pay its creditors.  These statements, though untrue, were repeated on three or four occasions.  As a result of 
them, Ms. Lang did not recommend a hitherto planned increase in Deere's purchases from Independence. The jury awarded 
Independence $15,000 of the $30,000 it had sought on the Deere claims. "

711,38," Defendants want to discount Grohne's testimony and any of Dr.  Madansky's assumptions that were based on it. In the first 
place, there was ample corroborative evidence from government and industry records, the testimony of suppliers, customers, 
and competitors, and even from defendants' experts. In the second, it was the jury's province to decide what weight and 
credibility to attach to Grohne's testimony in view of his interest.  Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 624 F.2d 575, 580

724,1," Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan, supra, at 4919 states:HN13[
] ""The pre-emption doctrine, which has its roots in the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art. VI, Cl. 2, requires us to examine 
congressional intent. Pre-emption may be either express or implied, and ""is compelled whether Congress' command is explicity 
stated in the statute's language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose."" Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 
525 (1977). HN14[
] Absent explicit preemptive language, Congress' intent to supersede state law altogether may be inferred 
because ""[t]he scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no 
room for the States to supplement it,"" because ""the Act of Congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so 
dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforceemnt of state laws on the same subject,"" or because ""the 
object sought to be obtained by federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose""."" Rice 
v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)."
724,2," Confusion was also widespread: ""Also adding to the confusion is the frequently present problem of a conflict of laws in determining which State statute is 
controlling, the law of the forum or that of the situs of the injury. "
725,," ""Even when the State whose statute of limitations is applicable has finally been ascertained, there remains still another hurdle to 
be overcome, namely the selection of the appropriate law of the State that governs private triple-damage proceedings.  The 
problem is complicated in many instances by virtue of the fact that statutes of limitation must frequently be chosen from those 
pertaining to the ancient common law forms of action such as trespass to persons and property, damage to property, and 
actions in the nature of actions on the case.  In those instances where the State law has established a special statute of 
limitations for actions upon a laibility created by statute, the selection of the proper limitation period may be immeasurably 
easier.  Even here, however, confusion as to the correct limitation period abounds."" Senate Report, supra, at 2331."
725,3," The Senate Report which acompanied the bill in its final form plainly declares that the confusion and unfairness engendered by 
the lack of a uniform statute of limitations was foremost in Congress's thoughts when it enacted Clayton § 4B: ""It is one of the primary purposes of this bill to put an end to the confusion and discrimination present under existing law where 
local statutes of limitations are made applicable to rights granted under our Federal laws.This will be accomplished by 
establishing a uniform statute of limitations applicable to rights granted under our Federal laws.  This will be accomplished by 
establishing a uniform statute of limitations applicable to all private treble damage actions as well as Government damage 
actions, of 4 years."" Senate Report at p. 2358.  (This same statement appears in the House Report at p. 9.) "
727,4," Read in its full context, Representative Quigley's statement concerning the ""substantive rights of individual litigants"" comes into 
focus.  Representative Quigley made the statement quoted by the plaintiff while responding to the concerns of Representative "
728,," Murray of Illinois that some antitrust suits which were already pending might be cut off by Clayton § 4B.  Representative Quigley 
prefaced his remark characterizing the bill as strictly procedural with the following statement: ""Mr. Quigley.  Suits that are already started and pending on the effective date of the act would not, in my judgment, be in any 
way affected by anything contained in this measure.  The provisions of this measure to which I have referred are procedural in 
nature.It is a statute of limitation, and in a State where a suit has already been started, whether under a 3-year period or a 4-year 
or a 6-year period statute of limitations, that statute of limitation has been tolled, and will in no way be affected by what we do 
here."""
728,101," Cong. Rec. H4365 (daily ed. Apr. 26, 1955). Representative Quigley's statements were part of the debate that eventually led to a six-month grace period that protected the 
""substantive rights of individual litigants."" Both the House and Senate reports explain the six-month protection: ""Section 4 of the bill provides that the effective date of the measure shall be 6 months after its enactment.  This provision will 
give a half-year period of grace within which treble damage actions may be brought by persons whose causes of action have 
accrued for more than 4 years, and who wish to bring suit in those States having applicable statutes of limitations greater than 
the 4-year period provided for herein.  Thus, where the State statute of limitations is longer than the new Federal statute, 6 
months is provided from the date of enactment of this measure for those whose rights may be cut off by the new limitation to 
bring their cases to court."" House Report, supra, at p. 2.  Similarly, the Senate Report states: ""Section 4 of the bill provides that the effective date of the proposed legislation shall take effect 6 months after its enactment.  
This will give plaintiffs, whose actions have accrued more than 4 years prior to enactment of this legislation, but who are not yet 
barred from suing under local statutes of limitation, half a year's grace within which to commence their suits."" Senate Rep., supra, at p. 2329."
728,5," Speaking of the ""conclusive effects"" of a statute of limitation, the Supreme Court, in effect, analyzes the ""element of a 
substantive nature in the operation of a limitation statute"" in Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944):HN24[
] ""Statutes of limitation, like the equitable doctrine of laches, in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by 
preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories 
have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.  The theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary 
on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the 
right to prosecute them."" Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944). "
729,6," Presumably, the Senate committee based its Ohio appraisal on the holding of Reid v. Doubleday & Co., 109 F. Supp. 354 (N.D. 
Ohio 1952), which is cited and discussed in the Senate Report.  Reid involved a claim brought under the Robinson-Patman Act 
before the enactment of Clayton § 4B. The district court looked to Ohio law to provide the relevant statute of limitations. The 
court saw the issue as whether the applicable period was contained in the statute of limitations pertaining to actions to enforce ""a 
liability created by statute other than a penalty or forfeiture"" or that prescribed for actions ""upon a statute for a penalty of 
forfeiture."" The court held that the six-year period contained in the former was applicable rather than the one-year period in the 
latter.  Id.  at 364. In reaching its decision, the Reid court neither discussed nor considered section 1331.12 of the Ohio 
Valentine Act. Therefore, the Senate Judiciary Committee's citation of Reid cannot be read as in any way ""recognizing"" or ""approving"" O.R.C.  
§ 1331.12's applicability to cases involving interstate commerce. Six years after the Senate Report was issued, the Sixth Circuit in Englander Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Company, 293 F. 2d 802 
(6th Cir. 1961), addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff's federal Robinson-Patman suit was barred by the Ohio statute of 
limitations. As in Reid, supra, the court considered whether the action was upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, or one 
created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty.  As in Reid, the court applied the six-year limitations period without ever 
discussing or considering the possible applicability of O.R.C.  § 1331.12. "
730,7," Klosterman, supra, observes that Westinghouse Electric Co. v. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., supra, ""noted that Congress, in 
enacting section 4(B), did not intend to expunge any cause of action but only to create a uniform period for commencement of 
suit under the federal antitrust laws."" The Ninth Circuit made its statement in Westinghouse Electric Co.  in the context of 
deciding that the fraudulent concealment of the existence of a cause of action based upon section 4 of the Clayton Act tolls the 
four-year statute of limitations established by Clayton § 4B. This court agrees with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion in Westinghouse Electric Co.  that Congress sought to establish a uniform 
four-year limitation period while preserving the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.  See Kansas City, Missouri v. Federal Pacific 
Electric Co.  [1962 TRADE CASES P70,550], 310 F. 2d 271 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 83 S. Ct. 256 (1962). However, this court is 
unable to find in section 4B's legislative history any support for the court's statement that ""[i]n enacting [Clayton § 4B] . . . 
Congress did not intend to expunge a cause of action. . . ."""
730,8," The district court concluded that as to the ""Clayton Act four-year statute of limitation"" and Ohio Revised Code § 1331.12, ""there is no conflict between the enactments, and the state law does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and 
execution of any of the purposes or objective of Congress."" As recorded earlier at pp. 15-16, this court has reached the opposite conclusions. "
734,9," In support of its argument that O.R.C.'s § 1331.12 statutory bar of statutes of limitations does not create ""the type of 
irreconcilable conflict necessary to justify preemption,"" plaintiff cites Rousseff v. Dean Witter & Co., Inc., 453 F. Supp. 774 (N.D. 
Ind. 1978). In Rousseff, plaintiff investor sued a securities broker-dealer for alleged violations of federal securities law, state 
securities law, and for common-law fraud.Plaintiff raised his state claim of negligent misrepresentation under Indiana's ""Blue 
Sky"" laws.  Indiana's statute applied a general three-year statute of limitations to plaintiff's action while the federal statutory 
action for negligent misrepresentation applied a one-year discovery rule.  Plaintiff proceeded under Indiana law, because this 
cause was barred under the federal law, but not under Indiana law. Applying the preemption test outlined in Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, the Rousseff court determined: ""The Indiana limitations period, however, does not directly conflict with, nor is it repugnant to, the primary purpose of the federal 
securities law, viz.  promoting full disclosure in securities transactions.  In fact, Indiana law enhances that purpose."""
734,453," F. Supp. at 781. Finding that Indiana's statute of limitations ""enhance[d] the primary and overall purpose of the federal 
[securities] law,"" the court ruled that it was not invalid under the Supremacy Clause. This court's reading of Clayton § 4B's legislative history leads this court to the opposite result reached in the securities disclosure 
law context by the court in Roussef.  This court notes that the Rousseff court does not discuss any legislative history of the 
federal securities laws' statutes of limitation. The court merely states that ""Congress' choice of limitations periods reflects its 
reasoned compromise in [satisfying] conflicting goals."" This court finds Clayton 4B's legislative history to run much deeper.  
Furthermore, while the Sixth Circuit cases discussed by this court may not be directly controlling, they support this court's 
conclusion that O.R.C.  § 1331.12 is preempted by Clayton § 4B under the circumstances of this case. "
743,1," This conclusion conforms with the view of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets that: ""[The] Milk Control Law [article 21 of the Agriculture and Markets Law] vests in the Commissioner * * * broad authority to 
supervise and regulate various aspects of the milk industry, but nothing in the law provides regulated parties with a blanket 
exemption from any other provisions of state law such as the Donnolly [sic] Act * * * ""The application of the price fixing provisions of the Donnolly [sic] Act to agreements between agricultural cooperatives and other 
parties which are not such cooperatives has never conflicted with the administration of the Milk Control Law. ""The practical construction placed upon the Agriculture and Markets Law by this Department has always been based upon the 
principle that the Agriculture and Markets Law did not preempt or otherwise exclude application of the Donnolly [sic] Act to illegal 
price fixing by agricultural cooperatives."" (Affidavit of J. Roger Barber, Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, dated Jan. 23, 1981, submitted to Supreme Ct, 
Rockland County, in Dairylea Co-op. v Attorney General, Index No. 127/1981, attached to People's memorandum of law as 
Exhibit C.) "
745,2," The proceedings in this action were stayed on August 31, 1981 pending disposition of defendants' omnibus motion to dismiss 
the Bronx County indictment. "
750,3, Dellwood Foods was indicted in The Bronx as well. 
759,1," We have been informed that a nearly identical lawsuit has been filed in federal district court raising similar claims under federal 
antitrust law. Inasmuch as respondents have not raised an issue in this regard, we make no ruling on whether appellants are 
entitled to ""two bites of the apple."""
759,2," The second amended complaint actually contains 11 causes of action.  Appellants conceded at oral argument that the 
demurrer was properly sustained as to the first count alleging price-fixing in the contract between the real estate broker and his 
salesperson.  Accordingly, we do not discuss that abandoned theory. "
760,3," A number of courts in other jurisdictions have ruled on the question of access to a MLS.  But, like Palsson, those cases have 
involved access by licensed real estate brokers. (E.g., United States v. Realty Multi-List, Inc., supra, 629 F.2d 1351; 
Pomanowski v. Monmouth Cty. Bd., supra, 89 N.J. 306; Blake v. H-F Group Multiple Listing Service (1976) 36 Ill.App.3d 730 
[345 N.E.2d 18]; Grempler v. Multiple Listing Service Bur. of Harford Co., Inc., supra, 258 Md. 419; Collins v. Main Line Board of "

of Realtors, supra, 300 N.W. 2d 127.)"
761,4," We note that while this matter was on appeal, the Legislature enacted sections 1086- 1090 of the Civil Code which expressly 
contemplate that only licensed real estate personnel will have access to a MLS.  The statute defines a MLS as a ""facility of 
cooperation of agents, operating through an intermediary . . ., through which agents establish express or implied legal 
relationships with respect to listed properties."" (Italics added.) An ""agent"" is defined as ""one authorized by law to act in that 
capacity for that type of property and is licensed as a real estate broker . . . or is a licensee . . . ."" (Italics added.) (Stats. 1982 ch. 
547, § 1; Civ. Code §§ 1087, 1086, subd. (d).) "
763,1," This matter is before us for a second time. HBC's action was initially dismissed for failure to state a claim affecting interstate 
commerce. A panel of this court affirmed. Dismissal was upheld again on rehearing en banc, Hospital Building Company v. "
764,," Trustees of Rex Hospital, 511 F.2d 678 (4th Cir. 1975). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, 423 U.S. 820, 46 L. 
Ed. 2d 37, 96 S. Ct. 33 (1975), and reversed, ruling that the complaint alleges a restraint of trade substantially affecting 
interstate commerce.  425 U.S. 738, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338, 96 S. Ct. 1848 (1976)."
764,2," Mary Elizabeth Hospital apparently had 49 beds when the application was filed. The Joint Planning Committee proceeded on 
the assumption that Mary Elizabeth had only 40 beds. "
765,3," The United States Supreme Court decided the Maricopa County case after argument in this matter had been heard. We 
recognize that Maricopa County applies the per se rule to allegations of price fixing in the health care industry. Unlike Maricopa 
County the instant case does not involve price fixing. Furthermore, the limited application given the rule of reason in this case is 
justified on much different and narrower grounds than those discussed in Maricopa County. "
768,4," Appellants also seek a new trial on their counterclaims for abuse of process and libel. Since appellants have asserted no error 
with respect to the trial of these issues, and since the retrial of the antitrust issues will be sufficiently complicated without 
introducing these additional issues, judgment for HBC on appellants' counterclaims is affirmed."
768,5," In Eastern Railroads Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), 
and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), the Supreme Court established 
that no violation of the antitrust laws can be predicated upon attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws, even if 
efforts in that regard are based upon anti-competitive motives. "
770,6," This ruling, of course, does not relieve HBC of the burden of proving that appellants' attempts to delay construction of the new 
hospital were violative of the Sherman Act under the rule of reason."
770,7," See Chief Judge Winter's discussion of the ruling in Brunswick in Lee-Moore Oil Company v. Union Oil Company of California, 
599 F.2d 1299, 1302-1304 (4th Cir. 1979). "
776,1," Jurisdiction is premised upon 28 U.S.C. sections 1331, 15 U.S.C.  sections 1, 15, 22."
776,2," Prior to the transfer of the instant action to this Court, the class was certified on January 25, 1982. In reviewing the transcript of 
the oral argument on the class issue, it is clear that the prior judge believed it to be a close question. In transferring the case to 
this Court, he personally indicated that it might be wise ""to take a fresh look at the whole question of class certification."""
776,3, The Court also certifies the instant ruling for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1292(b).
776,4," Plaintiffs allege that there are 135 current distributors and 212 past distributors in the putative class. These distributors 
apparently remain located in their respective territories."

777,6," None of the representative plaintiffs named in the action are presently working for the defendants. It is clear the deliverymen 
distributors currently employed by defendants would have differing interests from those named plaintiffs."
777,7," 15 U.S.C. section 1 provides in pertinent part: HN7[

conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
778,8," HN11[
] A jurisdictional requisite for a Sherman Act, Section 1 cause of action is a ""contract, combination . . . or conspiracy."" "
779,9," There has been no allegation of a uniform agreement in which the distributors were forced to adhere to the defendants' resale 
price policy.  Therefore, any overt action that would exceed the bounds of the Colgate Doctrine would be individualized in nature 
and thus not appropriately dealt with in the class action format."
779,10," The parties to this law suit are currently involved in other litigation before other courts regarding matters of collection with 
corresponding counterclaims. See, Areeda and Turner, Antitrust Law, paragraph 332. "
817,1," In its Third Amended Answer filed on December 22, 1980, Helena withdrew both of these counterclaims. "
818,2," Prior to the commencement of the trial of this cause in November, 1981, all of the parties filed motions to dismiss and motions 
for summary judgment.  Subsequently, the Court held a conference in chambers with counsel for all parties in attendance.  The 
conference was held for the purpose of affording counsel an opportunity to present oral argument on the various motions 
pending before the Court.  Because of the complexity of the factual and legal issues raised by the motions, the Court informed 
the parties after the presentation of their oral arguments that it would defer ruling on the dispositive motions, and would instead 
carry the motions with the case.  The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law of this Court set forth above address the issues 
raised by those motions as such issues affect the merits of the case.  Of course, those motions which the Court took under 
consideration were filed by parties who have since been dismissed from this case are denied as moot. "

826,6," During the trial of the instant cause, propanil has been referred to by the parties also as 3,4-DCPA, the short form for the 
chemical name of propanil; FW-734, the designation assigned to the chemical propanil by plaintiff (FW are the initials of the 
person under whose direction propanil was made; 734 is the number assigned to propanil, compounds are assigned numbers 
consecutively as they are made), and Stam, the commercial name assigned to the chemical propanil by plaintiff.  Testimony of 
Dougal McRae. "
828,7," More specifically, the examiner rejected all of the claims contained in the 1958 application as: The claims are indefinite and too broad in ""3,4-dichloropropionanilide"" (it is not clear which positions are chlorinated), 
""carrier therefor"", ""surface active agent"", ""inert organic solvent"", ""solvent-soluble wetting and emulsifying agent"" giving rise 
to compounds with different properties and that can react in a different manner.  There is not sufficient basis nor enough

(See In re Migrdichian 513 O.G. 757 and Ex parte Billman 71 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 253). "
829,," Claims 1 to 7 are rejected as unpatentable over Williams or Surrey that disclose p-chloro propionanilide and m-chloro 
propionanilide.  No invention is seen in adding another chlorine atom to the molecule of the reference compound. See Ex 
parte Teter 105 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 192. Claims 1 to 9 are rejected as unpatentable over Ng.Ph.  Buu-Hoi that discloses 3,4-dichloroacetanilide which is a lower 
homologue of the claimed compounds and the latter in the absence of a showing of unexpected results are unpatentable 
under the rulings of In re Hass et al 31 C.C.P.A. 903, 60 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 548, 141 F.2d 127; In re Henze 37 C.C.P.A. 1009, 
85 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 261, 181 F.2d 196. Claims 8 to 11 are rejected since no invention is seen in a method of applying 3,4-dichloropropionanilide or a higher 
homologue to undesired plants since any layman knows how to spray weeds with a weed-killer.  Sexton teaches the very 
similar process. Plaintiff's Exhibit 4."

116. Defendants' Notice Under 35 U.S.C. § 282. "
864,18," Although defendants assert that Rohm and Haas possesses a 100% monopoly of the herbicidal propanil market, there is 
evidence in the record to indicate that the contrary is true.  Shortly after Crystal filed for bankruptcy in September 1981, a 
company by the name of Cumberland Chemical Company (hereinafter Cumberland) was formed.  The company began 
operations at the same physical plant and offices once occupied by Crystal and retained also the same phone number.  Eller is a 
minority stockholder and Vice President of Cumberland.  Testimony of Joe Eller. Subsequently, Eller, on behalf of Cumberland, purchased some of the equipment that Crystal had used to manufacture 
herbicidal propanil. The leases between ARGE and Crystal covering additional equipment used for manufacturing herbicidal 
propanil were assigned to Cumberland.  Testimony of Joe Eller; Testimony of Richard Clipson.  Such equipment was acquired 
by Cumberland to enable it to engage in the manufacture and sale of herbicidal propanil. Testimony of Joe Eller.  As a result of 
Cumberland's assumption of all of Crystal's contractual arrangements with ARGE, specifically, the contract executed between "
865,," Crystal and ARGE on July 11, 1977, see Plaintiff's Exhibit 62, Cumberland became bound to supply herbicidal propanil to 
ARGE.  Testimony of Joe Eller.  Accordingly, the Court finds defendants' argument that Rohm and Haas possesses a monopoly 
of the herbicidal propanil market to be meritless. "
886,19," The counterclaims advanced by ARGE are predicated on its principal allegation that Rohm and Haas has engaged in illegal 
anticompetitive activity by tying the licensing of its patent to the purchase of propanil which it manufactures.  Rohm and Haas 
has not raised its statute of limitations defense against ARGE's counterclaims. "
887,20," In a response to a motion to dismiss filed by plaintiff during the trial, Crystal and Eller abandoned their antitrust counterclaims 
predicated on alleged threats made or coercive tactics pursued by Rohm and Haas prior to the issuance of the patent in suit, 
and on an alleged agreement between Monsanto and Rohm and Haas to divide the herbicide propanil market.  See Defendants' 
Reply to Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss at 6. "
889,21," Rohm and Haas has raised also the issue of Crystal's standing to pursue its counterclaims attacking the Bayer-Rohm and 
Haas agreements.  Although Rohm and Haas has raised a challenge that appears to have merit, the Court has already heard 
the evidence in this cause and considered the merits of Crystal's counterclaim based on the Bayer-Rohm and Haas agreements. 
Accordingly, because of the inevitable disposition of this counterclaim, the Court will refrain from deciding the merits of Rohm 
and Haas' standing argument. "
906,22," In partial defense to Rohm and Haas' claim for infringement damages, defendants assert that Rohm and Haas is estopped 
from claiming damages for the period from June 11, 1974, the date this suit was filed, to September 17, 1979, the filing date of 
Rohm and Haas' motion for leave to amend and supplement its complaint.  The crux of defendants' complaint is their allegation 
that Rohm and Haas waited five years after the commencement of this suit before asserting a claim for damages.  A review of 
Rohm and Haas' original complaint reveals that in addition to injunctive and declaratory relief, Rohm and Haas requested ""The 
costs of this action, and such other relief as the Court may deem just and the circumstances warrant . . . ."" It is readily apparent 
that no specific request for damages is made. Rule 54(c) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in pertinent part provides: HN114[
] ""every final judgment shall grant the relief 
to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings."" 
HN115[
] This provision which is to be liberally applied, 6 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice, supra, § 54.62, at 1266, permits 
a court to award a party ""damages even though equitable relief was prayed for; or . . . [grant] equitable relief although damages 
were prayed for; and the court may award equitable relief of a different nature than that sought by the prayer, id., at 1268-69 
(footnotes omitted).  Rule 54(c) does permit or perhaps even requires the trial judge to grant relief to which a party is entitled 
even if not requested in the prayer for relief."" International Harvester Credit Corp. v. East Coast Truck, 547 F.2d 888, 891 (5th 
Cir.1977). See also Hoffman La Roche, Inc. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., 210 U.S.P.Q. 374, 378 (D.N.J.1980). 
Hence, the Court is of the belief that a party can recover all the damages to which he is entitled if such a claim was advanced by 
the claimant well prior to trial.  This result is quite reasonable particularly in the instant cause where the suit was filed on the day 
the patent sued upon was issued.  Accordingly, Rohm and Haas had not as yet sustained any pecuniary loss.  Additionally, from 
the instant this suit was filed, defendants demanded to litigate and initially prevailed on the misuse defense, thereby resulting in "
907,," the dismissal of this cause until the entry of the Fifth Circuit's decision on July 30, 1979.  Moreover, within the months after the 
Fifth Circuit's decision, the plaintiff filed its motion for leave to amend its complaint to add a specific claim for damages.  
Regardless of the aforementioned circumstances, however, the Court is cognizant that damages should not be awarded to 
Rohm and Haas prior to the day of the filing of its motion for leave to amend.  In Sapp v. Renfroe, 511 F.2d 172, 176 n. 3 (5th 
Cir.1975) the Fifth Circuit stated: Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure HN116[
] has been construed liberally and under it the demand for 
relief in the pleadings does not limit, except in cases of default, the relief a court may grant when entering judgment.  See 
Thorington v. Cash, 494 F.2d 582, 586 n. 9 (5th Cir.1974). A party may be awarded the damages established by the 
pleadings or the facts proven at trial even though only injunctive relief was demanded in the complaint, unless such 
damages are foisted upon the parties by the court, or unless the failure to demand such relief prejudiced the opposing 
party.  Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791, 802-03 (4th Cir.1971); see J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 54.62 (2d ed. 
1974). In accord, see Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791, 803 (4th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 1006, 92 S. Ct. 573, 30 L. Ed. 
2d 655 (1971); Columbia Nastri & Carta Carbone v. Columbia Ribbon & Carbon Mfg. Co., Inc., 367 F.2d 308, 312 (2d Cir.1966); 
Wells v. Schmidt, 80 F.R.D. 463, 465-466 (W.D.Wis.1978). Despite defendants' argument to the contrary, the Court is unable to discern any prejudice that defendants will suffer as a result 
of the award of infringement damages to Rohm and Haas from the date of the issuance of its patent. Plaintiff's amendment, 
although filed five years after the institution of this cause, was interjected into this suit two years prior to trial and prior also to the 
commencement of the extensive and thorough discovery which was conducted by the parties.  Thus, defendants had ample 
opportunity to prepare their defenses to Rohm and Haas' damage claims. Defendants assert also that they continued to sell propanil after September, 1979 because of their belief that Rohm and Haas 
could not seek past damages and due to the relatively low degree of financial exposure facing them if Rohm and Haas did 
eventually prevail on its infringement claim.  In considering the merits of this contention, the Court finds the following language to 
be appropriate: Nor can it be said that it is unfair or unjust for Roche to claim treble damages for infringement and other classes of money 
damages, when in its early stages the case was directed only to a declaratory judgment and injunction.  An injured party 
may begin proceedings to vindicate his rights by seeking modest relief, less than he is entitled to claim, but such self 
restraint gives the adversary wrongdoer no right to insist on leniency so long as the case is open and undecided. Hoffman La Rochej, Inc. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., supra, at 378. Hence, on the basis of the reasoning set 
forth above, the Court finds defendants' claimed prejudice to be without merit and accordingly, the Court concludes that Rohm 
and Haas will be able to recover all of the damages to which it is entitled from the date of the issuance of the patent in suit. "
914,1," Interphoto Corporation is a subsidiary of Argus Incorporated, and Sugra Northeast, Incorporated is an affiliate of Argus that is 
wholly owned by Daniel Porco, the chief executive officer of both Argus and Interphoto."
914,2," The individual defendants are: Walter A. Fallon, Herman H. Waggershauser, Colby H. Chandler, Louis K. Eilers, Robert E. 
Anderson, Paul F. Cameron, William F. Rueger, Richard Hodges, Jay W. White, R. Stanley Dobler, Malcolm W. Smith, Arthur L. 
Chapman, Charles A. Burton, and Robert P. Burrows. "
915,3, Argus also alleges related conspiracies involving the individual defendants.
915,4," Much of the relevant background concerning the industry and several of the products here at issue is set forth in detail in the 
Berkey and GAF opinions and will not be repeated here."
915,5," The analysis here, and in the sections that follow, pertains only to plaintiffs' claims for damages.  Whether plaintiffs' 
corresponding claims for equitable relief are time barred is considered infra slip op. at 16-19. "
917,6," As with the flashcube conspiracy, the magicube conspiracy as alleged in the complaint necessarily terminated when the 
product was disclosed to the public at large."
917,7," Defendants also rely on various factual assertions set forth in the Berkey opinion.  Of course, the factual findings in Berkey 
cannot be binding on plaintiffs who were neither parties nor in privity with the parties in the Berkey action.  See Montana v. 
United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210, 99 S. Ct. 970 (1979). "
918,8," Plaintiffs once again argue that numerous conspiratorial overt acts subsequent to the public introduction of the product save the 
claim from the statute of limitations. As with the flashcube and magicube claims, the court holds that the flipflash conspiracy as 
alleged in the complaint necessarily terminated when the product was disclosed to the public at large. "
919,9," The products and the corresponding dates of introduction to the public are as follows: (1) 126 still photography system 
introduced in March 1963; (2) Super-8 movie system introduced in May 1965; (3) XL movie system introduced in August 1971; 
(4) 110 still photography system introduced in March 1972; and (5) Ektasound movie system introduced in August 1973."
919,10," The record does not establish whether Argus in fact had marketed competing products with respect to some of the equipment 
here at issue prior to the commencement of the limitations period. Nevertheless, the court has no doubt that the industry data 
available by the commencement of the limitations period would have been sufficient for plaintiffs to present a jury issue as to 
future damages with respect to each of the relevant products. "
920,11," The equitable relief sought by plaintiffs includes an order of divestiture against Kodak and injunctions restraining Kodak, G.E. 
and Sylvania from engaging in further anticompetitive acts."

921,13," Kodak and Sylvania made no attempt to demonstrate prejudice.  Although G.E. submitted an affidavit indicating that they 
suffered prejudice from the delay, plaintiffs have submitted an affidavit contradicting most of G.E.'s assertions therein."
921,14," The complaint refers to the product as a ""Wink"" camera, and refers to the alleged violation as the ""Wink Conspiracy""."
921,15, The court has limited discovery thus far solely to the statute of limitations issues. 
922,16," The Berkey court was there analyzing Kodak's simultaneous introduction of Kodacolor II film and compatible 110 instamatic 
cameras."
922,17," The court notes that plaintiffs assert in their opposition affidavits that Kodak engaged in additional conduct, not alleged in the 
complaint, that could give rise to a section 2 violation.  Since these claims are not properly pleaded, and since the court is 
denying the motion for summary judgment on the merits in any event, the court has no occasion to consider these allegations 
here."
922,18," The original complaint was filed on August 27, 1979.  Plaintiffs filed an ""amended and supplemental complaint"" on August 4,

933,1," Pending this appeal, Bos moved in the superior court to file a first amended complaint specifically naming Tenco, Inc., as a 
third party. The motion was denied without prejudice to renew after disposition on appeal.  We have denied Bos' motion to take 
judicial notice of the amended complaint and have struck such documents from the record on appeal.  The contents of the 
amended complaint have no bearing on the validity of trial court's prior ruling.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subd. (c); 6

933,2," Because of our resolution of the arbitrability issue in favor of Crown, it is unnecessary to consider the extrinsic evidence 
introduced by Crown regarding the meaning of the arbitration provision. "
937,3," Relying on the federal and New York precedents, the states of New Mexico and Washington also have held issues raised 
under state antitrust law are not subject to arbitration. ( United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co. (1979) 93 N.M. 105 [597 
P.2d 290, 309-312]; Wineland v. Marketex Intern., Inc. (1981) 28 Wn.App. 830 [627 P.2d 967].)"
937,4," We reject Crown's attempt to limit the applicability of the federal cases to the situation where the validity of a contract is 
challenged under the antitrust laws. The case for nonarbitration is more compelling where, as here, the alleged antitrust violation 
concerns anticompetitive activity independent of the validity of a contract containing an arbitration provision yet the enforceability 
of the contract is challenged on adhesion grounds.  (See American Safety Equipment Corp. v. J. P. Maguire & Co., supra, 391 
F.2d at p. 827.) "
950,1," The fact that the establishment of regional HSAs such as PLHSA was mandated by the NHPRDA distinguishes the holding in 
this opinion from the Fourth Circuit's recent decision in Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of the Rex Hospital, a Corporation, No. 
81-1134 (4th Cir. Oct. 19, 1982).  There, the defendants appealed from a $7.3 million treble damages judgment entered after a 
jury returned a verdict for Hospital Building Company (HBC) on its claims under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  
§§ 1 and 2.  HBC is a proprietary North Carolina corporation which operated Mary Elizabeth Hospital in Raleigh.  At trial, HBC "
951,," offered evidence that the defendants met with representatives of Blue Cross/Blue Shield and others and conspired to discourage 
proprietary competition in the North Carolina inpatient health services market, showing that Rex and Wake Memorial Hospitals 
organized an ad hoc committee of 26 Raleigh citizens to study the need for inpatient health services in the Raleigh area.  HBC 
took the position that this committee (Joint Committee) was controlled by representatives of the defendant Rex Hospital and 
others. On appeal, the defendants/appellants argued that the Comprehensive Health Planning Act, 42 U.S.C.  §§ 242g, 243, 246, and 
247(a), and other cited statutes (not including the NHPRDA) established a public policy contemplating that the defendants and 
others participate in precisely the sort of planning efforts engaged in by the Joint Committee.  See, Hospital Building Company, 
at 11.  Thus, they argued, since these planning activities fell ""within the scope and purposes"" of federal legislation, the activities 
of the Joint Committee were exempt from the antitrust laws. Id. The Fourth Circuit rejected that argument, finding that none of the pertinent legislation relied on by appellants contained an 
express exemption from the antitrust laws. The Fourth Circuit emphasized the fact that it was reviewing the planning activities of 
private health service providers and found that their participation in such activities was not mandated by any relevant act. "

975,4," There were several pendent claims, based on state law, in addition to the federal antitrust claim.  Green alleged claims based 
on the Minnesota Antitrust Law of 1971, Minn. Stat. Ann §§ 325D.49-.66 (West 1981), the common-law prohibition against 
interference with contract, common-law defamation, and breach of contract.  AMPI counterclaimed, alleging breach of the 
carrier's contract and seeking to collect under an indemnification agreement.  The District Court, after dismissing the federal 
antitrust claim, considered the factors set forth in Koke v. Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., 620 F.2d 1340, 1346 (8th Cir. 1980), and 
determined the pendent claims should be dismissed too.  The dismissal of the pendent claims is without prejudice to their 
reassertion in the state courts."
975,5, Mid-America Dairies was reducing the price it paid for milk. 
976,6," Generally, the milk hauling fee increases as distance from the farm to the dairy increases.  Even if AMPI paid producers a

dairies. Therefore, dairies may subsidize the farmer's cost of hauling. "

a protected list.  They were also given preferential selection rights in the NFL college draft.  Exhibit 4F to Rooney Affidavit,

991,6," The NFL's litigation problems have continued.  Recently, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court's finding that the NFL cross 
ownership ban preventing NFL owners from owning any other major professional sports team violated the Sherman Act. North 
American Soccer League v. National Football League, 670 F.2d 1249 (2d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1074, 103 S. Ct. 499,

team to the Los Angeles area.  Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League, Civ. No. 78-3523-HP 
(C.D.Cal.).  And of serious consequence to the owners, players and fans is the NFL players' strike which began in September 
1982."
991,7," As a result of this lawsuit, defendants have since examined the merits of plaintiffs' application and have found it, in their eyes,

not presently a member of the League shall be eligible for membership."
993,3," .3(A) Each applicant for membership shall make a written application to the Commissioner.  Such application shall 
describe the type of organization and shall designate the city in which the franchise of the applicant shall be located; such 
application shall further describe and contain the following information: (1) The names and addresses of all persons who do or shall own any interest or stock in the applicant, together with a 
statement that such persons will not own or hold such interest or stock for the benefit of any undisclosed person or 
organization. (2) A detailed balance sheet of such company as of the date of organization and a pro forma statement as of the time it 
shall commence actual operation.  A written financial statement shall be required from the applicant and from anyone 
owning an interest in any applicant, including stockholders and partners. (3) If applicant is a corporation, a certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and share certificate shall 
accompany such application provided, however, if the organization of such corporation has not been commenced or 
completed a detailed statement summarizing the proposed plan of operation and the capital structure thereof shall be

Partnership or organization agreement shall accompany such application. (5) The names and addresses of all officers and directors. (6) All applications shall contain a representation that upon acceptance, the applicant will subscribe to and agree to be 
bound by the Constitution, By-Laws, Rules and Regulations of the League and any amendments or modifications thereof. (B) Each application for membership shall be accompanied by a certified check for Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars 
($25,000.00).  Upon approval of any application for membership, an additional Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) 
shall be paid to the League. If any application for admission is rejected, the League shall repay to the applicant the sum of 
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) paid by the applicant at the time of such application, less all expenses 
reasonably incurred in connection with the consideration and investigation of such application. (C) Upon receipt of any application for membership in the League, the Commissioner shall conduct such investigation 
thereof as he deems appropriate.  Following the completion of such investigation, the Commissioner shall submit the 
application to the members for approval together with his recommendation thereon, and such information thereon that the 
Commissioner deems pertinent.  Each proposed owner or holder of any interest in a membership, including stockholders in 
any corporation, members of a partnership and all other persons holding any interest in the applicant must be individually

997,21," Plaintiffs ask that this court apply the test announced by the court in Denver Rockets v. All-Pro Management, Inc., 325 F. 
Supp. 1049 (C.D.Cal.1971). That court viewed the Silver case as an exception to the finding of group boycotts as per se 
violations for reasonably self-regulated industries.  The test requires: (1) that there exists a legislative mandate for self-regulation 
or otherwise; (2) the group action is intended (a) to reach a result consistent with the policy justifying self-regulation; (b) is 
reasonably related to that goal; and (c) is no more expansive than necessary; and (3) there are procedural safeguards assuring 
the restraint is not arbitrary and which provides a basis for judicial review.  Id. at 1064-65. This test has not been applied by the 
Third Circuit.  Thus I will use instead the traditional Rule of Reason test, this test having been recently reaffirmed by the Third 
Circuit in Fleer Corp. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 658 F.2d 139 (3d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1019, 102 S. Ct. 1715, 72

997,22," Two commentators on the law of sports have expressed the following view concerning the awarding of sports franchises: The admission practices of sports leagues present a different concern.  An analysis of the relationship between clubs within 
a league suggests that the various league members do not compete with one another in an economic sense.  Rather, a 
league is more like a partnership. While each club initially contributes its own capital, the various participants to a large 
extent share in the joint profits of the venture. This participation in profits is achieved through various arrangements, such 
as the pooling of television receipts and the division of gate receipts between home and visiting clubs. Thus, a decision on 
access to membership is basically a decision as to whether particular individuals (or their business entities) will be allowed 
to participate in the partnership venture.  Since the various members pool their efforts and do not engage in economic 
competition with one another, an adverse decision on membership in the usual case has no appreciable impact on the level 
of competition which will take place. J. Weistart & C. Lowell, The Law of Sports § 3.16, at 315 (1979) (footnotes omitted). "

Ed. 2d 137 (1982), a manufacturer of bubble gum sued a rival bubble gum manufacturer and the Major League Baseball Players 
Association claiming the defendants had excluded effective competition in the sale of baseball cards because of their exclusive 
licensing contracts.  The Third Circuit held that these contracts did not foreclose competition in part because Fleer could still 
compete for licensing contracts with minor league players which, in time, may become major league players. The fact this 
process may take several years to become profitable, the court found, did not make the defendants' agreements anticompetitive. "

1001,33," Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945), found a 90% share of a 
relevant market conclusive evidence of monopoly power.  Plaintiffs allege that the relevant product market is major league 
professional football; the relevant geographic market is the United States, with a submarket in the ""Mid-South"" area comprised of 
Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas.  Defendants do not dispute these contentions and I find them to be acceptable."
1001,34," Judge Hand phrased it in this manner: ""The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon 
when he wins."" United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d at 430. "

1004,2," Defendant's expert, Dr. John Landon, testified that defendant had ""taken the position that if Lansdale goes into the electric

1005,4," We note that, because of the form of the interrogatories, we cannot determine how the jury defined the relevant geographic 
markets.  Indeed, the jurors may have employed precisely the definition that Lansdale urged, but found Philadelphia Electric to 
lack monopoly power. "

in the retail market. "
1013,1," In its brief on this motion, K&R presents copies of some internal GM memoranda, presumably obtained during discovery.  
These documents, more in the nature of evidence than of demonstrative exhibits, are intended to rebut portions of GM's 
argument by showing that GM cancelled the order when it learned of K&R's involvement and its plans to export the cars.  The 
memoranda reveal that another Oldsmobile dealer was approached before Hejhal Olds, but that the first dealer refused to 
participate in the plan.  The memoranda also detail K&R's and Continental's attempt to conceal K&R's involvement and the 
autos' intended destination.  K&R does not appear to dispute the truth of the various statements contained in the memoranda.  
The court does not consider these documents in determining the legal sufficiency of the allegations of K&R's Second Amended 
Complaint. "
1015,2, The parties have disagreed over how Gas-A-Tron should be read.  The court agrees with K&R's reading.
1015,3," Challenges to vertical restrictions can come from at least two types of plaintiffs: unauthorized dealers who wish to deal in the 
goods subject to the restrictions, and authorized dealers who wish to deal outside their authorized territory.  The latter type of 
plaintiff often will be a direct purchaser. GTE Sylvania involved such a direct purchaser. Continental T.V. was authorized to sell 
from a San Francisco location only, but it sought authorization to sell from a Sacramento store as well.  When this authorization 
was denied, it prepared to transfer some of its inventory to Sacramento for sale from an unauthorized location.  Relations 
between Continental and Sylvania broke down, and Sylvania terminated Continental's dealership.  That plaintiffs who are 
authorized dealers often will be direct purchasers is not a convincing reason for enforcing a direct-purchaser requirement where 
unauthorized dealers, who often cannot be direct purchasers, wish to challenge vertical restrictions."
1015,4," This party has the expertise and the incentive to orchestrate a plan for unauthorized competition.  On the other hand, this party, 
like all the participants in the unauthorized distribution, may prefer not to challenge the restrictions as long as its unauthorized 
dealing is undetected or tolerated.  Only, perhaps, when the manufacturer takes steps to prevent the competition will the 
unauthorized competitors have an incentive to bring an antitrust suit.  This situation should be distinguished from that of a party 
wishing to become an authorized dealer. (K&R has alleged no such desire.)"
1015,5," It fairly can be inferred from K&R's allegations, especially for purposes of a 12(b) (6) motion, that K&R was a principal in the 
exporting operation."
1015,6," According to the documents submitted with K&R's brief on this motion, Hejhal Olds, the direct purchaser from GM, was 
approached by the other participants only after another Olds dealer had declined to participate. "
1018,7, K&R alleges that its state law claim is within the court's diversity jurisdiction. 
1019,8," Because it is able to dismiss Count I based on K&R's pleadings alone, the court need not tackle the question of whether it may 
consider the documents submitted by K&R with its brief.  Rule 12(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., permits the court to consider extrinsic 
evidence, but the court then must invite the parties to treat the motion as a full-scale summary judgment motion under Rule 56.  
Arguably the court would be free to use such extrinsic evidence against the party submitting it without calling for more papers.  If 
these papers were considered the court might well find K&R estopped to complain of interference with its export contract, since 
the documents indicate that K&R informed GM that it had no such contract, and that the cars in fact would remain in the United 
States. "
1021,1," Defendants apparently argued in the court below that they enroll subscribers under a ""true family status"" rule which requires 
enrollment according to marital status.  While they apparently allowed an individual to enroll in a plan covering only himself, if the 
individual wishes coverage for additional family members, coverage must be purchased for the entire family except under limited 
circumstances.  Defendants asserted that this policy derives from their practice of ""community rating"" which is a method of 
setting rates so that subscribers in a definable affinity group pay the same rate regardless of the risk represented by individual 
applicants for coverage. ""Community rating"" ostensibly reduces costs by eliminating pre-enrollment physical examinations and 
reducing administrative expenses. Plaintiff, in his brief in this court, on p. 6, takes exception to the district court's mention of certain facts in its opinion as coming 
from defendant's brief and oral argument rather than from the complaint.  While plaintiff does not now, and apparently did not in 
the trial court, bother to deny these facts, to avoid further controversy we will not refer to them other than in this footnote.  In all 
events, we think the district court's reference to those facts was entirely harmless, if error at all.  We also believe that most, or 
perhaps all, of the facts objected to, are matters of public record because defendants must file with the State Corporation 
Commission, which is the controlling regulatory authority, their "". . . rate manual showing rates, rules and classification of risks 
applicable thereto . . . ."" as well as a copy of the form of each policy.  Va. Code § 38.1-342.1."
1021,2," The McCarran-Ferguson Act provides, in part: § 2(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the 
purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax on that business, unless such Act 
specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, 
known as the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of

1022,3," The decision in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n, 322 U.S. 533, 64 S. Ct. 1162, 88 L. Ed. 1440 (1944), 
prompted Congressional passage of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  In South-Eastern Underwriters the Court held that insurers 
conducting business across state lines were in interstate commerce, and that Congress did not intend to exempt insurance 
companies from the Sherman Act. Id. at 539, 553, 560. South-Eastern Underwriters overruled Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 
168, 183, 19 L. Ed. 357 (1869), which had held that issuance of an insurance policy was not a transaction of commerce and thus 
made insurance regulation the exclusive province of the States.  In response to South-Eastern Underwriters, Congress 
considered several measures providing insurance companies with varied exemptions from antitrust laws. See Royal Drug, 440 
U.S. at 217-20. One of Congress' principal concerns was that insurance companies be able to continue joint efforts at risk 
evaluation under State scrutiny without the interference of federal antitrust laws. Id. at 221. The use of the phrase ""business of 
insurance"" was an effort to restrict the antitrust exemptions to activities truly within the domain of State insurance regulation. Id. 
at 220-24."
1022,4," By the late 1930's, 24 states had adopted enabling acts which brought non-profit hospital service plans under State 
departments of insurance or, in some instances, under the departments of health or welfare.  Nine other states, including 
Virginia, had ruled that hospital service plans were not insurance companies and were exempt from insurance statutes.  Rorem, 
Enabling Legislation for Non-Profit Hospital Service Plans, 6 Law & Contemp. Prob. 528, 531-32 (1939). As discussed later, 
Virginia has subsequently adopted legislation which provides for State Corporation Commission regulation of service benefit 
plans under the insurance code and makes certain Virginia insurance laws applicable to such plans.  Va. Code §§ 38.1-810 to 
834. "

1025,8," In Times-Picayune, the Supreme Court considered whether it was a tying arrangement for the owner of two newspapers to 
require advertisers to purchase space in both newspapers rather than in either newspaper individually.  Id. at 596-97. The 
Supreme Court held that no tying arrangement existed: The common core of the adjudicated unlawful tying arrangements is the forced purchase of a second distinct commodity 
with the desired purchase of a dominant ""tying"" product, resulting in economic harm to competition in the ""tied"" market.  
Here, however, two newspapers under single ownership at the same place, time, and terms sell indistinguishable products 
to advertisers; no dominant tying product exists . . .; no leverage in one market excludes sellers in the second, because for 
present purposes the products are identical and the market is the same. "
1026,, Id. at 614.
1026,9," In Dexter, the plaintiff argued that it was an illegal tying arrangement for an insurance company to require the purchase of life 
insurance as a condition for obtaining a mortgage loan.  Id. at 234.  The Second Circuit held that the practice was immune from 
antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act."

1026,11, The plaintiff does not argue coercion or intimidation in his brief. 
1031,1," Allegations relating to the FTC occupy ten of the thirty paragraphs of Grant's counterclaim, as well as nine of its eighteen 
pages. "
1033,2," In their reply brief (pp. 10-11) plaintiffs assert that the market share required to state a claim under Section 2 also is necessary 
to state a claim under Section 1.  The court reads plaintiffs' cases as stating merely that HN7[
] a Section 1 claim must allege some appreciable adverse effect on competition; Section 1 does not require a market share so large as to make monopolization 
a dangerous probability.  Havoco of America, Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 558 (7th Cir. 1980); Associated Radio Service 
Co. v. Page Airways, Inc., 624 F.2d 1342, 1348 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1030 (1981). Language in Page Airways 
arguably supports plaintiffs' position, but this definitely is not the holding of the precedent relied upon in Page Airways.  See 
Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. Omark Industries, Inc., 576 F.2d 83 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1116 (1979). "

therefore did not belong at any time to Association members.  Ct. Rec. 96, Affidavit of Hal Marchant, Tab 2.1 at 2.  However, this 
is no longer disputed since it is conceded that the ""China Bar"" collecting boom which is stretched across the point where the 
Canadian logs float into the Lake catches those stray logs. Thus, defendants, as well as anyone else, may pay the Department 
of Reclamation for logs collected at that boom. "

1066,1," At that time, a Dow Jones Retail Sales Manual reflected the company policy, which sought to prevent overpricing -- sale of 
publications at greater than the cover price listed by Dow Jones -- by retailers."
1066,2," A memorandum sent to Williams, dated May 15, 1974, is illustrative; it explained: ""The problem of overpricing in Sacramento by 
Ralph Marston has not changed.  I have personally answered the two letters directed to Mr.  Phillips regarding the situation.  
[para. ] I have also discussed the problem with Mark Peterson on several occasions and Mark agrees with me that our only "
1067,," recourse to solve the problem is to terminate Ralph Marston giving him a 30-day notice.  Obviously, the price situation would 
play no part in our conversation with Marston."" In a cable wherein Williams expressed his frustration at the length of time needed to dispose of Marston, he added: ""Should 
Marston create this much thought processes, indeed, what will take place when we eliminate Mr.  Kolling and Mr. Vlaco?"" "
1068,3," Williams mentioned that the home delivery rate ""was up to the dealer."""
1068,4, Kolling first learned of his impending termination when he was contacted by Fisher. 
1070,5," The following anticompetitive restraints were asserted by respondents: 1) maximum price-setting; 2) territorial restrictions; and 
3) exclusive dealing arrangements. "
1071,6," In Adolph Coors Co. v. F. T. C., supra, 497 F.2d at page 1185, the court noted that, ""[any] trespass on the independence of a 
reseller or wholesaler to set his own prices is a violation of the Sherman Act."""
1071,7," In Oakland-Alameda County Builders Exchange v. F.P. Lathrop Constr.  Co., supra, the court declared: ""Under both California 
and federal law, agreements fixing or tampering with prices are illegal per se.  The principle was stated clearly by the United 
States Supreme Court: '[For] over forty years this Court has consistently and without deviation adhered to the principle that 
price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se under the Sherman Act and that no showing of so-called competitive abuses or evils 
which those agreements were designed to eliminate or alleviate may be interposed as a defense . . . .  Any combination which 
tampers with price structures is engaged in an unlawful activity.  Even though the members of the price-fixing group were in no 
position to control the market, to the extent that they raised, lowered, or stabilized prices they would be directly interfering with 
the free play of market forces.  The [Sherman] Act places all such schemes beyond the pale and protects that vital part of our 
economy against any degree of interference.' [Citation.]"" (4 Cal.3d at p. 363.) "
1072,8," In light of this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to decide whether respondents' ""business claim is supported by evidence of 
unreasonable territorial or exclusive dealership restraints."" Even if neither the territorial restriction nor exclusive dealing practices can support the judgment, the jury verdict may be upheld 
on the price-fixing theory.  ( Henderson v. Harnischfeger Corp. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 663, 673-674 [117 Cal.Rptr. 1, 527 P.2d 353].) 
General verdict forms were presented to the jury, so we do not know upon which theory the verdict was based. For the same reason, we find it unnecessary to discuss the merits of the ""territorial restriction claim."""
1072,9," In Brunswick, the Supreme Court was faced with the problem of whether a certain injury to a business fell within the protection 
of the antitrust laws. Brunswick Corp. is a giant in the bowling industry and had acquired some defaulting bowling centers in the 
plaintiffs' market area.  These centers were defaulting on payments owed for bowling equipment purchased from Brunswick.  
Had the centers been allowed to close, plaintiffs' business and profit would have increased due to a higher share of the market.  
Plaintiffs alleged that Brunswick's acquisition of the defaulting bowling centers might substantially lessen competition in violation 
of § 7.  They sought treble damages for lost profits under § 4.  A jury awarded damages and the trial court trebled them.  The 
Supreme Court reversed, finding that: ""It is inimical to the purposes of these laws to award damages for the type of injury 
claimed here."" (429 U.S. 477, 488 [50 L.Ed.2d 701, 712].) "
1074,10," Because of our conclusion that the ""business claim"" can be upheld on other grounds, it is unnecessary for us to decide 
whether the record supports the verdict based upon evidence of territorial or exclusive dealership restraints on trade.  
Nevertheless, the appellants' claim of instruction error in connection therewith requires that we discuss the evidence of territorial 
and exclusive dealership restrictions to determine the propriety of the challenged instructions. "
1075,11," We feel that territorial restrictions and exclusive dealing restraints were established, but, for the most part, were motivated by 
legitimate business concerns rather than an intent to suppress competition.  ( Newberry v. Washington Post Co. (D.D.C. 1977)

since some evidence was offered to support them."

Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a) (2), does subject foreign states to American jurisdiction for suits based on their 
commercial activity in the United States.  It has been argued that it would not serve American foreign policy interests to give 
private defendants more consideration under the act of state doctrine than a foreign government would receive in similar 
circumstances under the sovereign immunities act.  See, e.g., Note, Sherman Act Jurisdiction and the Act of Foreign 
Sovereigns, 77 COLUM. L. REV. 1247, 1257 (1977)."

Ind. v. Kennecott Copper Corp. (2d Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 10, 13, n.6. "
1092,4," A Rule 3(g) Statement is a ""short and concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no 
genuine issue to be tried"", or as to which the party in opposition contends there are indeed triable issues.  See Local Civil Rule 
3(g) (formerly 9(g)).  Plaintiff's Rule 3(g) Statement refers to certain of its ""principals"" as being United States citizens.  We 
interpret the term ""principals"" to mean holders of the outstanding shares of plaintiff's stock. "
1093,5," The Alcoa rule -- also known as the ""intended effects"" test, see Conservation Council of Western Australia v. Alcoa (W.D.Pa. 
1981) 518 F. Supp. 270, 275; Dominicus Americana Bohio v. Gulf & Western, supra, 473 F. Supp. at 687 -- is the law in this 
Circuit.  However, the rule has not remained unchanged since the mid 1940s when Judge Hand penned that well-known 
passage.  As Judge Carter himself stated in Dominicus, ""the effects test alone is inadequate, because it fails to take into account 
potential problems of international comity."" Id. A commentator recently thus summarized the legal trend: . . .  American courts . . . based their decisions to apply American antitrust law to foreign restraints exclusively on the 
effect of such restraints on United States foreign commerce. Their central concern was to draw the line between restraints 
that Congress intended to reach and restraints it did not intend to reach. . . . This attitude has recently given way to an awareness . . . that courts should weigh foreign regulatory interests . . . when 
deciding whether to give extraterritorial effect to American antitrust law.  Note, Foreign Sovereign Compulsion in American 
Antitrust Law.  33 Stanford L. Rev. 131, 132-33 (1980) (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, at least two Circuits -- the Third in Mannington Mills v. Congoleum Corp. (3d Cir. 1979) 595 F.2d 1287, and the 
Ninth in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, supra, 549 F.2d 597 -- have applied the ""intended effects"" test only ""as the 
first step in a two-step process . . . in determining whether to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction pursuant to the Sherman Act. * * * 
If such jurisdiction is proper [under the Alcoa rule] the court should then use a balancing test that takes into account various 
foreign relations impact factors in order to determine whether the exercise of that jurisdiction is appropriate."" Conservation 
Council of Western Australia v. Alcoa, supra, 518 F. Supp. at 275. See also Industrial Inv. Development Corp. v. Mitsui & Co. 
(5th Cir. 1982) 671 F.2d 876, 884 n.7. In light of our ruling that plaintiff has failed under the ""old"" Alcoa test, we have no occasion "
1094,," to speculate whether our Circuit would follow the trend and thus modify the Alcoa rule in accordance with the teachings of 
Timberlane or Mannington Mills. Cf. Dominicus Americana, supra, 473 F. Supp. at 687-88."
1094,6," So far as we are aware, the collection of cases cited by plaintiff includes practically all regularly cited decisions on the 
extraterritorial application of antitrust legislation.  We here briefly refer to each of the cases plaintiff has cited.  In United States v. 
Sisal Sales Corp. (1927) 274 U.S. 268, 71 L. Ed. 1042, 47 S. Ct. 592, among the allegations of the government's complaint were 
that the domestic commerce of the United States had an annual requirement of two hundred fifty to three hundred million pounds 
of sisal, all of which the defendants conspired to control; and that in the course of the conspiracy the defendants foreclosed 
mortgages on, and took title to, four hundred thousand bales of fiber actually stored within the United States.  Id. at 272. In 
United States v. National Lead Co. (1947) 332 U.S. 319, 91 L. Ed. 2077, 67 S. Ct. 1634, affirming, United States v. National 
Lead Co. (S.D.N.Y. 1945) 63 F. Supp. 513, the government's complaint alleged, among other things, that the importation of 
titanium pigments was essential to a forty-million dollar domestic manufacturing industry, Id. at 517, and that no ""titanium 
pigments entered the United States except with the consent of"" one of the conspirators.  Id. at 522. In Continental Ore Co. v. 
Union Carbide (1962) 370 U.S. 690, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404, the Supreme Court remanded for a new trial, overturning 
the Ninth Circuit's decision to grant a directed verdict for defendants who had been charged with violating Sections 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act. ""The complaint stated that [in the relevant period] the defendants produced over 99% of all ferrovanadium and 
over 90% of all vanadium oxide [the relevant markets] produced in the United States and that during the same period the 
defendants sold over 99% of the ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide sold in this country."" Id. at 693-94 (footnote omitted).  It was 
held that the trial court had erred in rejecting plaintiffs' offer to prove that they had been excluded from the Canadian market by a 
wholly owned subsidiary of one of the defendants ""allegedly operating . . . for the purpose of carrying out the overall conspiracy 
to restrain and monopolize the vanadium industry."" Id. at 703. Such offer of proof was ruled relevant evidence as to the 
allegations of domestic misconduct, but there is no suggestion that the Canadian events -- standing alone -- would be 
cognizable under the antitrust laws. Pfizer, Inc. v. India (1978) 434 U.S. 308, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584, merely established 
that a foreign government is a ""person"" within the meaning of § 4 of the Clayton Act, and has no bearing on the question before 
us.  In Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, supra, 549 F.2d 597, it was alleged that plaintiff was an Oregon partnership 
principally involved in the purchase and distribution of lumber at wholesale within the United States and in its importation into the 
United States for sale and use.  Id. at 603. Yentsch v. Texaco, Inc. (2d Cir. 1980) 630 F.2d 46, dealt with an alleged conspiracy 
in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act whereby a domestic oil company sought to control the prices changed by its American 
retailers. In Industrial Investment Development Corp. v. Mitsui & Co. (5th Cir. 1982) 671 F.2d 876, the Court of Appeals reversed 
an order granting summary judgment prior to discovery where it had been alleged that an American company engaged in 
importing lumber into the United States had conspired to prevent another American company from competing with it.  In Joseph 
Muller Corp. v. Societe Anonyme de Gerance (2d Cir. 1971) 451 F.2d 727, ""the trade and commerce in the commodity involved 
originated in the United States and was to be shipped from it to other countries."" Id. at 729. In Sanib Corp. v. United Fruit Co. 
(S.D.N.Y. 1955) 135 F. Supp. 764, the District Court declined to dismiss as insufficient on its face a complaint by a United States 
citizen who alleged that a business he had been conducting in New York City had been destroyed by the alleged conspiracy. 
Todhunter-Mitchell & Co. v. Anheuser-Busch Inc. (E.D.Pa. 1974) 383 F. Supp. 586, involved imposition of territorial restraint on 
distributors of beer in, among other places, Miami and New Orleans.  In Dominicus Americana Bohio v. Gulf & Western, supra, 
473 F. Supp. 680, Judge Carter denied summary judgment prior to discovery where plaintiffs, some of whom were American 
corporations, claimed to have been prevented from soliciting American citizens to travel from the United States to the Dominican 
Republic.  Id. at 688, and further claimed that the use of American transportation facilities had been restricted by the conspiracy. 
Id. at 685. National Bank of Canada v. Interbank Card Ass'n. (S.D.N.Y. 1980) 507 F. Supp. 1113, had to do with a conspiracy to 
control the use of credit cards which had effects on, among other things, ""the continuous use of Master Charge cards in the 
United States and Canada by cardholders who cross the border, [and] on the clearing activities of the various United States 
banks in the Interbank system . . ."" Id. at 1120-21. "
1095,7," Plaintiff asserts that certain interrogatories are still outstanding, but specifically disclaims any contention that discovery should 
not be deemed complete for purposes of this motion.  Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to G&W Defendants' Motion 
at 8. "
1096,8," For these purposes, we join plaintiff in rejecting defendants' contention that Bolivian gold can be sold only to the Bolivian 
government."
1096,9," In a different context the Supreme Court observed, ""in general restraints upon competition have been condemned only when 
their purpose or effect was to raise or fix the market price."" Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader (1940) 310 U.S. 469, 500, 60 S. Ct. 982, 
84 L. Ed. 1311. Certainly, we have been given no information which would suggest that control over the Bolgol Concessions by 
defendants rather than by plaintiff would have any effect on the world-wide price of gold, nor how such control would ""suppress 
or even destroy competition."" Chicago Board of Trade v. United States (1918) 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242; 
Apex Hosiery, supra, 310 U.S. at 501; E.J. Delaney Corp. v. Bonne Bell, Inc. (10th Cir. 1975) 525 F.2d 296, 302, cert. denied 
(1976) 425 U.S. 907, 47 L. Ed. 2d 758, 96 S. Ct. 1501. "
1097,10," Plaintiff points out that, as things turned out, disputes among the defendants prevented them from exploiting the Bolgol once 
they had acquired it.  Defendants' failure in this regard, however, is clearly independent of the claimed anti-competitive thrust of 
the conspiracy alleged.  Cf.  Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America (2d Cir. 1980) 637 F.2d 41, 48 (quoting Contreras v. Grower 
Shipper Ass'n. (N.D.Cal. 1971) [1971] Trade Cas. P 73,592, aff'd per curiam, (9th Cir. 1973) 484 F.2d 1346, cert. denied, (1974) 
415 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 1445, 39 L. Ed. 2d 490)."
1097,11," Plaintiff's standing to sue on such an injury is altogether questionable.  See Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists 
Theatre Circuit, Inc. (2d Cir. 1971) 454 F.2d 1292, 1295; Reading Ind. v. Kennecott Copper Corp. (2d Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 10,

1099,1," The Fifth Circuit announced the general standard for determining the fairness and adequacy of a class action settlement as 
follows: Case law provides us with general ground rules: 'The settlement terms should be compared with the likely rewards the 
class would have received following a successful trial. '. . .  And: 'the strength of the case for plaintiffs [must be] balanced 
against the amount offered in settlement. '. . . We think this requires a three-step process.  First, the district court must 
evaluate the likelihood that plaintiffs would prevail at trial.  Second, the district court must establish a range of possible 
recovery that plaintiffs would realize if they prevailed at trial.  And third, guided by its findings on plaintiffs' likelihood of 
prevailing on the merits and such other factors as may be relevant, the district court must establish, in effect, the point on, 
or if appropriate, below the range of possible recovery at which a settlement is fair and adequate.  In re Corrugated 
Container Antitrust Litigation, 643 F.2d 195, 212 (5th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted)."
1099,2," The trial judge, in making his determination, may be guided by the following and other relevant considerations:"
1099,1," . The most important factor is the strength of the case on the merits, balanced against the amount offered in the 
settlement;"
1099,2, .  The defendant's ability to pay;
1099,3," .  The complexity, length, and expense of further litigation;"
1099,4, .  The amount of opposition to the settlement. 
1100,3," These defendants were Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., Packaging Corporation of America, Fibreboard Corporation, 
Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Potlatch Corporation, The Fibre Box Association, and Crown Zellerbach Corporation. "
1106,4," Both the Consolidated and Interstate settlements were approved by this court and that approval was affirmed.  In re Corrugated

class trial concluded in this litigation."
1111,6," Petition for certiorari was granted recently in a class action antitrust suit that allowed a large measure of damages to the 
plaintiff class.  In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, 655 F.2d 627 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. granted Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Lyman Lamb

1972), cert. denied 406 U.S. 976, 92 S. Ct. 2411, 32 L. Ed. 2d 676 (1972) (The policy of the law encourages compromise to 
avoid the uncertainties of the outcome of wasteful litigation and expense incident thereto). "
1122,*," The Honorable David L. Bazelon, Senior Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting 
by designation. "
1123,1," Polygram Distribution, Inc. is the company's present name.  The company was known as UDC, Inc. between 1971 and 1973, 
and Phonodisc, Inc. between 1974 and 1977."
1123,2," At the time of the filing of this action, MTS was the sole shareholder of Tower Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Tower 
Records.  Since that time, Tower Enterprises, Inc. has merged into MTS. "
1124,3," The district court limited the summary judgment to this period because the declaration of Dale Johnson, a Polygram employee, 
filed in support of the motion, did not demonstrate personal knowledge for the 1971-73 period.  The court denied Polygram's 
motion for the period 1971-73 without prejudice to its renewal."
1124,4," The court's order effectively removed Capitol as a defendant.  However, since Capitol neither requested nor received a 
separate judgment under Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it did not take an appeal until after the court 
entered final judgment in June, 1980."
1124,5," In summary, the appellees in this action include five distributors: WEA, Polygram, Capitol, ABC, and MCA; one retailer, MTS; 
and Doug Robertson Advertising Agency.  Appellants appeal the following rulings with respect to each defendant: WEA: June 21, 1976, CR 311, partial summary judgment on the Robinson-Patman claims. January 17, 1980, CR 808 summary 
judgment on the Sherman Act claims. POLYGRAM: August 17, 1977, CR 499, partial summary judgment on the Robinson-Patman claims for 1974-76. "
1125,," January 17, 1980, CR 808, summary judgment on the Robinson-Patman claims for 1971-73 and on Sherman Act claims. MCA: January 17, 1980, CR 808, summary judgment on both the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Act claims. CAPITOL: September 28, 1978, CR 636, summary judgment on the refusal to deal Sherman Act claim. ABC: May 12, 1980, CR 851, summary judgment on both the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Act claims. MTS-TOWER & DOUG ROBERTSON: January 17, 1980, CR 808, summary judgment on both the Robinson-Patman and 
Sherman Act claims."
1125,6," WEA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Brothers Records, Inc., which in turn is owned by Warner Communications, Inc.  
WEA distributes records and tapes manufactured by Warner Brothers Records and two other Warner Communications, Inc. 
subsidiaries, Elektra Records and Atlantic Records.  Polygram is a California corporation distributing records and tapes 
produced by affiliated corporations, Polygram, Inc. and Polydor International."
1125,7," MCA is a wholly owned subsidiary of MCA Records, Inc.  From 1971 to 1979 ABC was a wholly owned subsidiary of American 
Broadcasting Companies, Inc.  In 1979, it went out of business and its assets were sold to MCA."
1125,8," Although MCA's declaration in support of its motion for summary judgment does not contain any percentage figures on the 
amount of records and tapes manufactured outside of California, it seems to indicate that a substantial amount of the records in 
its California warehouse were manufactured in Illinois.  ABC's answers to interrogatories indicate that an unidentified percentage 
of the records and tapes in its California warehouse were manufactured outside of California. "
1126,9," The relevant jurisdictional language in section 2(a) reads: HN2[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce to discriminate in price 
between different purchasers . . . where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce."
1126,10," Appellees argue that Gulf Oil superseded the ""flow of commerce"" test and therefore requires an actual sale across state lines 
to invoke the Act.  However, in Gulf Oil, the product sold, asphaltic concrete, was manufactured entirely in state from products 
obtained intrastate and its market was entirely local.  419 U.S. at 192. Therefore, the Court did not have to address the issue 
when sales of goods produced in another state are ""in commerce."" In fact, however, the court in Gulf Oil repeatedly refers to the flow of commerce test.  Thus in comparing the Sherman Act and 
Robinson-Patman Act jurisdictional provisions the Court states: In contrast to § 1, the distinct ""in commerce"" language of the Clayton and Robinson-Patman Act provisions with which we 
are concerned here appears to denote only persons or activities within the flow of interstate commerce -- the practical, 
economic continuity in the generation of goods and services for interstate markets and their transport and distribution to the 
customer. "
1126,419," U.S. at 195. Accordingly, courts interpreting section 2(a) after Gulf Oil continued to apply the ""flow of commerce"" analysis.  See L & L Oil Co. 
v. Murphy Oil Corp., 674 F.2d 1113, 1116, (5th Cir. 1982); Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC, 557 F.2d 971, 979 (2d Cir. 
1977), revd. on other grounds, 440 U.S. 69, 59 L. Ed. 2d 153, 99 S. Ct. 925 (1979); Hampton v. Graff, 516 F.2d 100 (5th Cir. 
1975). "
1127,11," The other indicium of intent involves whether goods have been altered or processed in some fashion after their arrival in the 
state of their eventual sale.  Courts have generally held that where goods are processed in some substantial way, the flow of 
commerce ends when they arrive at the place of alteration.  See Belliston v. Texaco, Inc., 455 F.2d 175 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
408 U.S. 928, 33 L. Ed. 2d 341, 92 S. Ct. 2494 (1972); Baldwin Hills Building Material Co. v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp., 
283 F. Supp. 202 (C.D. Cal. 1968); Von Kalinowski, supra, at § 26.02[3]. In this case, since the records and tapes were sealed after manufacture, this factor is not relevant. "
1128,12," In American Building Maintenance, the Supreme Court held that two janitorial service corporations were not ""in commerce"" as 
required under section 7 of the Clayton Act.  In particular the court rejected the United States' claim the firms' purchases of 
cleaning equipment manufactured out of state provided jurisdiction: Those products were purchased in intrastate transactions from local distributors. Once again, therefore, the Benton 
companies were separated from direct participation in interstate commerce by the pricing and other marketing decisions of 
independent intermediaries.  By the time the Benton companies purchased their janitorial supplies, the flow of commerce 
had ceased. "
1128,422," U.S. at 285. In contrast, here there is a legitimate question of material fact whether the record retailers were in fact insulated 
from interstate commerce by WEA or Polygram. "
1129,13," Appellants interpret Inglis to suggest that any interstate sales by the record distributors here satisfy the Robinson-Patman 
jurisdictional requirements.  However, their reliance on Inglis fails to recognize the structural difference between the two cases.  
Inglis was a ""primary line"" Robinson-Patman case in which the plaintiff alleged that another seller's discriminatory pricing 
scheme damaged his bakery.  As the court in Inglis noted, in such a primary line case the relevant sales for jurisdictional 
purposes include all sales, both intrastate and interstate, reflecting the price disparity since the court is concerned with all sales 
which allegedly damaged a competitor's business. HN10[
] In contrast, this is a ""secondary line"" case, in which one buyer complains of discriminatory treatment between itself 
and another buyer. In such a case, the only relevant sales are those between the competing buyers. Mayer Paving & Asphalt 
Co. v. General Dynamics Corp., 486 F.2d 763, 767 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1146, 39 L. Ed. 2d 102, 94 S. Ct. 899 
(1974); P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, at para. 233(c).  Out of state sales made by the distributors are irrelevant in this case 
since they were not made to stores competing with appellants."
1129,14," Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13(d) and 13(e) provide: (d) HN11[
] Discriminatory payments for services or facilities "
1130,," That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or 
for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any 
services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale or offering for 
sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or 
consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products 
or commodities. (e) Discrimination in furnishing services or facilities That it shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of 
a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the 
furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of such commodity 
so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."
1130,15," The district court also dismissed appellants' claim against MTS under sections 2(d) and 2(e) for receiving discriminatory 
payments or services.  HN15[
] Unlike section 2(f), sections 2(d) and 2(e) do not provide for a buyer's liability for receiving enumerated benefits.  See Rowe, supra, at § 14.5.  Consequently there is no private right of action against buyers for violating 
those sections.  See Grand Union Company v. FTC, 300 F.2d 92 (2d Cir. 1962); Rickles, Inc. v. Frances Denney Corp., 508 F. "
1131,," Supp. 4, 1980-81 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P63,829 (D. Mass. 1981); General Beverage Sales Co. v. East Side Winery, 396 F. 
Supp. 590 (E.D. Wis. 1975). Cf.  American News Co. v. FTC, 300 F.2d 104 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 824, 9 L. Ed. 2d 64, 
83 S. Ct. 44 (1962) (FTC may reach such conduct as an ""unfair trade practice"" under section 5 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
15)."
1131,16," The district court observed the same evidentiary shortcomings on appellants' part in its opinion granting summary judgment in 
favor of Capitol on the refusal to deal claim in September, 1978, see 1978-2 Trade Cases para. 62,269 (N.D. Cal. 1978), and its 
subsequent opinion granting summary judgment on the Sherman Act claims in favor of appellees WEA, MCA, Polygram, MTS 
and Doug Robertson of June, 1980.  533 F. Supp. 540 (N.D. Cal. 1980). "
1132,17," Appellants also allege a variant of the overall conspiracy consisting of a series of conspiracies between all the distributors and 
each chain store retailer. Summary judgment was appropriate as to this claim for the same reasons as in our discussion of the 
overall conspiracy set out below. "
1133,18," In what appears as an afterthought, appellants also claim that the distributors engaged in resale price maintenance.  Yet they 
offered no probative evidence in support of this proposition.  Moreover, the claim is fundamentally inconsistent with their 
principal theory of the case -- that the Zoslaws were unable to compete with the large retailers because the distributors gave 
those retailers more favorable terms.  Under appellants' theory, retail price maintenance would have been advantageous to them 
since it would have restricted the large retailers' ability to undercut their prices. "
1134,19," In contrast, we have recognized that HN27[
] a predatory pricing claim may form the basis of both a primary-line Robinson- Patman case alleging injury to another seller and a section 2 Sherman Act claim since both statutory provisions ""are directed at 
the same evil and have the same substantive content."" William Inglis, 668 F.2d at 1041 (quoting Janich Brothers, Inc. v. 
American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855 (9th Cir. 1977)). Here, however, appellants' secondary-line Robinson-Patman claim -- 
that they did not receive the same price as a competing buyer -- has no direct counterpart under section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1136,20," According to Areeda and Turner average variable cost is actually an imperfect substitute for marginal cost, made necessary 
because business firms rarely keep records reflecting marginal cost.  P. Areeda & D. Turner, Predatory Pricing, supra, at 717.  A 
price equal or exceeding marginal cost is the appropriate test because then only less efficient producers will suffer larger losses 
per unit.  In addition a price equal to marginal cost signals to consumers the ""true social cost"" of producing the additional unit, 
therefore promoting the efficient allocation of resources.  P. Areeda & D. Turner, Predatory Pricing, supra, at 710-713; Inglis, 
668 F.2d at 1032."
1136,21," Inglis specifically reserved the question whether a price above the defendant's average total cost could ever be considered 
predatory. 668 F.2d at 1035 n.30. In that instance, the producer recovers the total cost of production, including fixed costs, as 
well as a ""normal"" rate of return on its investment, making the price ""profitable"" from an economist's view.  Id."
1136,22," MTS did not operate any stores in Marin County during the period in question.  Its two stores in the San Francisco Bay Area 
are in San Francisco and Berkeley. The district court identified the relevant geographic market here as the San Francisco-Marin County market since that is the only 
geographic area of competition between Marin Music Centre and MTS.  Yet appellants did not present any evidence nor do they 
even argue that MTS' share of this submarket is larger than its share of the six San Francisco Bay Area counties.  Indeed, MTS 
only operates one store in the ""San Francisco-Marin County"" market. "
1137,23," Appellants' complaint also charged MTS with monopolization of the retail record and tape market in violation of section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. The district court granted summary judgment on this claim and appellants do not raise this issue on appeal.  In 
any event, appellants' failure to respond to MTS' evidence of its relatively small market share made summary judgment on this 
claim appropriate.  See, e.g., Forro Precision, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., 673 F.2d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 
1982) (evidence of 35% of market share alone insufficient as a matter of law to support monopolization claim). "
1141,*," Judge Sprecher was originally the third member of the panel, but his untimely death prevented his participation in the decision 
of this case.  Judge Posner took his place and has read the briefs and pertinent portions of the record and listened to the tape 
recording of the oral argument. "
1166,1," Defendants have moved to strike certain portions of plaintiff's brief on the ground that it raises certain matters not of record.  By 
separate order we grant defendants' motion. "
1167,2," In a section of the Memorandum stated ""Venue Is Not Proper Under Local Law"" defendants observe, ""Plaintiff cannot even 
assert jurisdiction absent his federal claim."""
1167,3," Defendants attempted to anticipate objections to their tardiness in raising the jurisdictional question by pointing out in their 
motion that ""the question of venue is interwoven with that of personal jurisdiction. . . .  It should be emphasized that the motions 
of ADA and Dr. Cappuccio are for dismissal for improper venue and lack of jurisdiction."" We reject as bootstrap their 
representation that the motions pertaining to venue expressly or implicitly raised the issue of jurisdiction."
1167,4," Fed R. Civ. P. 12(g) & (h) provides in pertinent part: (g) HN1[

motions herein provided for and then available to him.  If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any 
defense or objection then available to him which this rule permits to be raised by motion, he shall not thereafter make a 
motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h) (2) hereof on any of 
the grounds there stated. HN2[
] (h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses. "
1168,," (l) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of 
process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither made 
by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be 
made as a matter of course."
1168,5," In their supplemental brief, filed at this court's request, defendants cite to the district court's opinion appearing at pages 68 and 
76-78 of the appendix as raising the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction over ADA.  Those citations are unavailing.  The first 
involves a plain reference not to ADA but to the individual defendants; the second incorporates a section in which defendants 
concede that personal jurisdiction exists with respect to plaintiff's federal antitrust claim. See supra note 2. "
1169,6," We therefore need not decide whether International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 90 L. Ed. 95, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945), 
and its progeny would ever bar a state's exercise of jurisdiction over a transient defendant where jurisdiction has been initiated 
by proper service of process upon him in its territory and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. "
1171,7," In an effort to find some basis for imposing the burden on the plaintiff to prove proper venue, the dissent in this case attempts 
to analogize venue with jurisdiction.  See conc. & diss. op. slip op. at 4.  But the cases reiterate that ""jurisdiction and venue are 
not to be confused.  The former connotes the power to decide a case upon the merits; the latter connotes locality -- the place 
where the suit should be heard."" Standard Stoker Co. v. Lower, 46 F.2d 678, 683 (D.Md. 1931). Stated in other terms, venue 
concerns not the authority of the court to hear and adjudicate the case but relates to the convenience of the litigants, Panhandle 
Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 324 U.S. 635, 639, 89 L. Ed. 1241, 65 S. Ct. 821 (1945), and to the proper 
place where the power to adjudicate may be exercised.  See United States ex rel. Rudick v. Laird, 412 F.2d 16, 20 (2d Cir.), cert.

343 F.2d 7, 11 (8th Cir. 1965). See generally C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of Federal Courts § 42, at 149 (2d ed. 1970).  As 
Judge Craven has noted, ""The distinction between jurisdiction and venue is of hornbook importance and cannot be 
overemphasized."" Wheatley v. Phillips, 228 F. Supp. 439, 440 (W.D.N.C. 1964). Any attempt, therefore, to shift the burden of 
proof to the plaintiff on this basis is without merit or authority."

403 F. Supp. 123 (D.N.H. 1975), directly relies on Aro, the jurisdiction case."
1171,10," There is no doubt that HN9[
] when a defendant's motion to dismiss raises a question concerning the court's power to 
entertain the action (i.e., jurisdiction), the burden of proof with respect to that issue falls on the plaintiff.  See, e.g., McNutt v. 
General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189, 80 L. Ed. 1135, 56 S. Ct. 780 (1936) (jurisdictional amount); Adams v. 
American Bar Association, 400 F. Supp. 219, 222 (E.D.Pa. 1975) (service of process).  But with those dilatory defenses that do 
not concern the court's authority to adjudicate, the defendant bears the burden of proof. This is true with respect to motions to 
dismiss for forum non conveniens, see Aigner v. Bell Helicopters, Inc., 86 F.R.D. 532, 543 (N.D. Ill. 1980); failure to join an 
indispensable party, see Meyerding v. Villaume, 20 F.R.D. 151, 153 (D. Minn. 1957); failure to exhaust remedies, see Dorn v. "
1172,," Meyers Parking System, 395 F. Supp. 779, 786 (E.D. Pa. 1975); and failure to state a claim, see Canty v. City of Richmond,

1172,11," Judge Garth, citing to 15 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3826 (1976), urges that the 
""better view"" is that ""in venue, as in jurisdiction, the plaintiff must bear the burden of proving proper venue."" Conc. & Diss. op. at 
733.  The ""better view"" referred to in Wright, Miller & Cooper, however, is a quotation from a district court opinion, Ryan v. 
Glenn, 52 F.R.D. 185, 192 (N.D. Miss. 1971), and that opinion, like other cases relied on by the dissent, offers no reasons to 
support its view."
1172,12," HN11[
] 15 U.S.C. § 22 provides in pertinent part: ""Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be 
found or transacts business. . . ."" ADA is neither an inhabitant of, nor is found in, the Virgin Islands.  A corporation is an 
inhabitant of its state of incorporation, in this case Illinois.  Amateur-Wholesale Elecs. v. R.L. Drake Co., 515 F. Supp. 580, 583 
(S.D. Fla. 1981). And to be found in a district, a corporation must by the carrying on of business by its officers or agents be 
present there in a continuous and systematic way.  Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of America, Inc., 403 F. Supp. 123, 128 (D.N.H. 
1975). ADA's activities in the Virgin Islands do not rise to this level.  To be ""found"" within the jurisdiction requires more contact 
than to transact business. Stern Fish Co. v. Century Seafoods, Inc., 254 F. Supp. 151 (E.D. Pa. 1966); Amateur-Wholesale 
Elecs. v. R.L. Drake Co., 515 F. Supp. 580 (S.D. Fla. 1981). The ""transacts business"" term in the venue provision of the Clayton 
Act has a much broader meaning than the ""doing business"" language of the general venue statute.  Sherman College v. 
American Chiropractors Ass'n, 534 F. Supp. 438, 440 (N.D. Ga. 1982). We note in passing that ADA, in its motion to dismiss, did not object to service of process on the basis that it violated 15 U.S.C. 
§ 22 for failure to serve in Chicago or wherever ADA ""may be found."""
1172,13," In its memorandum opinion dismissing the ADA's venue motion, the district court stated: ""The ADA and VIDA contend that

1174,16," Not all courts have embraced this analysis.  See, e.g., Bartholomew v. Virginia Chiropractors Ass'n, 612 F.2d 812 (4th Cir. 
1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 938, 64 L. Ed. 2d 791, 100 S. Ct. 2158 (1980); Academy of Ambulatory Foot Surgery v. American 
Podiatry Ass'n, 516 F. Supp. 378 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). To the extent that they are not factually distinguishable from the case at bar 
we find these latter decisions unpersuasive.  Both evaluate the activity of membership organizations inter alia by reference to the 
amount of commercial activity engaged in by the organizations, and by comparing the relative number of members within the 
district to the organization's total membership. HN12[
] Whether a professional membership organization is transacting 
business in a district should be determined with reference to its purposes -- including the assurance of professional standards of 
conduct -- and not by reference to commercial standards.  And this court has in another context highlighted the fallacy of using a 
ratio test to evaluate the substantiality of a national corporation's activity in a particular district.  See Hendrickson v. Reg O Co., 
657 F.2d 9, 12-13 (3d Cir. 1981). "
1175,17," In such a construction we are reminded that the phrase ""is not to be given a technical or legalistic meaning."" Stern Fish Co. v. 
Century Seafoods, Inc., 254 F. Supp. 151, 153 (E.D. Pa. 1966)."
1175,18," Of the other cases cited in the dissent, three involved trial by the court on the merits without a jury.  United States v. Ohio 
Barge Lines, Inc., 607 F.2d 624 (3d Cir. 1979); Pepi, Inc. v. Helcar Corp., 458 F.2d 1062 (3d Cir. 1972); O'Neill v. United States, 
411 F.2d 139 (3d Cir. 1969). A fourth, Kreda v. Rush, 550 F.2d 888 (3d Cir. 1977), involved a motion to disqualify counsel for 
conflict of interest.  None of the cases involved a motion to dismiss for improper venue under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). "
1176,19," Although the dissent acknowledges that it can find no case to support its position that the district court must find facts or 
discuss its reasons for its choice of section 22 venue, it suggests that ""in analogous circumstances this court has uniformly 
imposed such a requirement so that appellate review would be possible."" Conc. and diss. op. at 736.  I disagree. First, unlike the 
cases to which he refers, Judge Garth recognizes that there is no ""factual controversy"" here about the facts relevant to venue. 
ADA itself provided detailed affidavits describing its activities in the forum and did not dispute the affidavits Myers offered.  
Second, the administrative agency cases to which Judge Garth points, unlike the procedural dispute now before us, were 
resolved on the merits by the agencies involved.  Furthermore, in administrative agency cases we must, under our scope of 
appellate review, ascertain whether substantial evidence supports the agency's findings, Cotter v. Harris, 642 F.2d 700 (3d Cir. 
1981) or, with respect to certain agencies, whether the agency's review board has discharged its obligation to determine whether 
the administrative law judge's initial decision was supported by substantial evidence, Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. 
McCabe, 593 F.2d 234 (3d Cir. 1979). With respect to disability matters, we have noted that both the Administrative Procedure 
Act governing administrative adjudication generally and regulations applicable to decisions of ALJ's in disability matters ""require 
that the administrative law judge specify the reasons or basis for the decision."" Cotter v. Harris, supra, 642 F.2d at 705. The dissent also points to cases dismissed under Rule 37 or settled and dismissed under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. These cases also involve a final determination of the disputes and not a purely procedural issue as we have here.  
For instance, in Quality Prefabrication, Inc. v. Daniel J. Keating Co., 675 F.2d 77, 81 (3d Cir. 1982), we required some 
articulation on the record of the bases for the district court's decision to dismiss a complaint with prejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
37(b) for failure to provide discovery.  It was the severity of the ""ultimate sanction"" of a dismissal with prejudice that led us to 
require a statement of reasons.  Similarly, we have required such an explanation when a district court approves a class action 
settlement and dismisses the complaint, see Bryan v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d 799, 804 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 
U.S. 900, 42 L. Ed. 2d 146, 95 S. Ct. 184 (1974). In these cases, a statement of reasons was deemed essential to permit us to 
review a final order denying the plaintiff his day in court.  By contrast, the instant case involves an interlocutory appeal denying a 
motion to dismiss for improper venue and the effect of this decision is hardly of the same consequence. The dissent also discusses Interpace Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 438 F.2d 401, 404 (3d Cir. 1971), but glosses over the 
precise holding of that case: that a statement of reasons is not required when a district court rules on a motion for class 
certification under Rule 23.  Similarly, in Plum Tree, Inc. v. Stockment, 488 F.2d 754, 756 (3d Cir. 1973), involving a motion 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for transfer of venue, although we advised that ""it would be helpful"" if the district court provided a 
statement of explanation, we declined to require such a statement.  Furthermore, in Plum Tree, venue was possible in either of 
two jurisdictions, and a statement of reasons was helpful in reviewing the decision to transfer the case to the alternate forum.  
No transfer is involved here. Finally, Allis Chalmers Corp. v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 521 F.2d 360 (3d Cir. 1975), cited by the dissent, involves the court's 
appellate jurisdiction.  We required reasons for a district court's Rule 54(b) certification in order to ascertain whether the appeal 
before us was from a final or interlocutory order and thus whether we had jurisdiction.  We considered that a statement of 
reasons was vital for a jurisdictional determination.  Here, we have no question of jurisdiction."
1176,20," Judge Garth would require ""an extensive factual basis"" for the venue determination.  Conc. & diss. op. at 742.  No authority is 
offered for such a position.  Rather, courts have stated that ""only one act may be enough to fulfill the venue requirements of the 
statute."" Courtesy Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tennessee Walking Horse Ass'n, 344 F.2d 860, 865 (9th Cir. 1965). See Golf City, Inc. v. 
Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 555 F.2d 426, 437 (5th Cir. 1977) (""Certainly the conducting of a golf tournament by a corporation in 
a particular judicial district would constitute the transaction of business in that district within the meaning of the Clayton Act."") 
(dictum).  The extensiveness of the factual record is unimportant if the substantial character of the transaction is established. "
1177,1," 15 U.S.C. § 22 provides that: Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such 
cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found. "

1179,3," Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 8(c) provides in part: In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, 
assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, 
illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, 
waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. "
1180,4," Following is the district court's entire venue opinion: VENUE The ADA and VIDA contend that venue cannot lie in the Virgin Islands in the case at bar.  They base their assertions on 15 
U.S.C. § 22 and 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b).  Under the general federal venue statute in non diversity cases venue will lie where 
the cause of action arose or where the defendants reside. In addition, the antitrust acts expand venue to any district where 
a corporation transacts business.  The defendants maintain that Dr. Myers failed to meet any of the venue standards and 
therefore the case must be transferred or dismissed.  We cannot agree. The District Court of the Virgin Islands has more expansive jurisdiction than its stateside counterparts.  As a territorial court 
is is [sic] not limited to the constraints placed on federal courts by Article III Section 2 of the constitution.  In essence a 
federal territorial court wears two hats -- one when it sits as a federal court and another when it hears local matters.  In the 
case sub judice we are wearing both hats simultaneously. Certainly plaintiff's cause of action based on the local antimonopolies law, II V.I.C. § 1501 et seq. is properly before this 
Court.  In Godfrey v. International Moving Consultants, 1980 STT Supp. 498 (D.V.I. 1980) we held that the federal venue 
provisions do not apply to the District Court of the Virgin Islands when it is deciding local matters.  We cannot as readily 
circumvent the venue provisions however, when the court is exercising federal jurisdiction. Because the ADA and some of the individual defendants do not reside here, venue will only lie in this Court if the cause of 
action arose in the Virgin Islands.  Defendants rely on the ""weight of the contacts test"" to support their contention that the 
action arose outside the territory.  That test provides that ""if some overt act pursuant to the conspiratorial meetings took 
place in a district and it was a significant and substantial element of the offense, then venue would lie in the district."" 
Philadelphia Housing Authority v. American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp., 291 F. Supp. 252, 260-61 (E.D. Pa. 
1968); see Friends of Animals, Inc. v. American Veterinary Med. Ass'n., 310 F. Supp. 620 (S.D. N.Y. 1970). The core 
around which the threads of plaintiff's complaint winds is the ADA's adoption of the code of ethics which restricted Dr. 
Myers' practice.  That code was formulated and adopted by the ADA in Illinois.  Once the ADA embraced the code VIDA's 
charter required it to do likewise.  Thus defendants made a strong showing that no overt act occurred in this jurisdiction. Plaintiff's choice of venue however is proper.  Again it is justified in part by the special status of the District Court of the 
Virgin Islands.  Dr. Myers' federal cause of action is based on the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.  Because in 
most circumstances sections 1 and 2 of the Act do not apply in the Territories of the United States, plaintiff must specifically "
1181,," rely on 15 U.S.C. § 3. Section 3 provides that restraints of trade affecting the Territories of the United States are illegal.  
The ADA's promulgation of the code of ethics in Illinois and VIDA's compulsory adoption ot [sic] if [sic] [of it] affected Dr. 
Myers' practice in St. Thomas.  Thus, even though many of the overt acts of the alleged conspiracy occurred in Illinois the 
injurious effects could be found in the Virgin Islands. Furthermore, civil antitrust actions arise where the damages occur.  The injury that flows from an illegal conspiracy sounds 
in tort.  Thus the antitrust claim can be tried where the injury (i.e. the business damage) occurs.  Albert Levine Assoc. v. 
Bertoni & Cotti, S.p.A., 314 F. Supp. 169, 171 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). In summary, venue properly lies in this forum.  Firstly, plaintiff's claim based upon local law invokes our article I jurisdiction.  
Secondly, Dr. Myers brought suit under a federal statute aimed at preventing illegal combinations in restraint of trade in the 
territories.  The restraint of trade caused injury in the Virgin Islands and therefore the cause of action arose here.  
Defendants' motions based on improper venue will be denied. Defendants also assert that the Virgin Islands is an inconvienent [sic] [inconvenient] forum to try this case.  See 28 U.S.C. § 
1404 (a).  Based on the affidavits proffered by plaintiff it is clear that any forum would be inconvenient to some of the 
witnesses.  We foresee no undue hardship or injustice to the parties by requiring them to try this action before us.  
Accordingly, defendants' motion based on forum non conveniens will be denied. District Court Opinion, Appellant's Appendix 81-84 (footnotes omitted). "
1182,5," I recognize that in a Plum Tree, Inc. v. Stockment, 488 F.2d 754 (3d Cir. 1973), 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) context, the burden of proof 
is appropriately upon the defendant because in such a circumstance, where a plaintiff has properly laid his action in a venue 
permissible under § 1404(a), any motion by the defendant to change venue to a venue of the defendant's choice requires the 
defendant to produce evidence or considerations proving his position.  Thus, a 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) decision is relevant only 
after a determination has been made as to compliance with the mandate of, in this case, 15 U.S.C. § 22 -- a statute prescribing 
the legal standards to be satisfied in determining venue. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that ""the doctrine of forum non 
conveniens can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction or mistake of venue."" Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 504, 
91 L. Ed. 1055, 67 S. Ct. 839 (1946) (emphasis supplied). Hence, the fact that the burden of proving venue is placed on a defendant in a § 1404(a) context can give little comfort to the 
Majority in a 15 U.S.C. § 22 context. "
1183,6," My reference to the district court's failure to furnish findings or reasons is not intended as a criticism of the district court.  As I 
have taken pains to point out earlier in light of Myers' actions in pressing only his § 1391(b) venue argument it would have been 
surprising if the district court had nevertheless insisted upon making findings under § 22.  My only purpose in emphasizing the 
lack of such findings made by the district court is to point out this court's improvidence in seeking to provide facts and reasons 
and thus supply that, which the district court was unable to, and did not supply. "
1188,7," I have been careful to distinguish between the two defendant parties in this case.  One of the parties, the National Association 
of Chiropractic Examiners was properly found to have transacted business for venue purposes because it designed, scored and 
administered the accreditation examination within the district.  These functions, without exception, have been deemed sufficient 
for § 22 venue. See text supra, slip op. pgs. 12-13.  I note that the ADA performs no such functions in the Virgin Islands. The second party, the American Chiropractic Association, was held to have ""transacted business"" in the Northern District of 
Georgia solely because it conducted three to four seminars over a five-year period.  It is this latter holding which I believe to be 
flawed and inconsistent with all other § 22 venue cases arising in a not-for-profit associational context. "
1189,8," The Majority Opinion charges that a reversal or remand on the 15 U.S.C. § 22 issue would result in compelling the plaintiff 
Myers, to ""proceed on his local anti-monopoly claims in the Virgin Islands and on his federal claims separately in Illinois . . . 
[thereby splitting] the proceedings into two and [trying] one in a distant point on the mainland. . . ."" Maj. Op. at 730.  I point out, "
1190,," however, that it is Congress which has drawn 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) to require that, in this case, venue would lie only in Illinois.  It 
is also Congress that has mandated that the ADA must ""transact business"" or be ""found"" in the Virgin Islands to sustain venue 
under 15 U.S.C. 22 in that locale. Thus it is not my analysis that may lead to ""judicially inefficient and costly [proceedings],"" Maj. Op. at 729, but rather the specific 
venue legislation duly enacted by Congress for its own policy reasons -- legislation which we are not authorized to repeal. "
1207,1," In this opinion the terms ""restrictive covenant,"" ""anticompetitive covenant,"" and ""covenant not to compete"" are used 
interchangeably to refer to a provision of an employment contract purporting to limit an employee's power, upon leaving his 
contractual employment, to enter as a competitor into the market in which his former employer does business or practices a 
trade or profession. "

] restrictive covenants are ""enforceable if reasonable and supported by valuable consideration."" 54 Am. Jur.2d, Monopolies, Restraints of Trade, and 
Unfair Trade Practices, § 543.  They then throw up their hands; ""There is no inflexible formula for deciding the ubiquitous

1213,7," Our courts should approach the available authority with respect to time and area limitations with caution.  Most other courts fail 
to use the distinction we have adopted between a threshold inquiry as to the reasonableness of the covenant and a ""rule of best 
result"" within the general ambit of the rule of reason. Those courts use rule of reason language well past the threshold inquiry, 
and their standard of reasonableness for purposes of shaving the covenant to reasonable proportions should not be confused 
with a standard of ""reasonableness on its face"" for the purpose of deciding whether the covenant merits further scrutiny."
1213,8," An analogy to this approach can be found in Board of Education v. W. Harley Miller, Inc., 160 W.Va. 473, 236 S.E.2d 439 
(1977), where we discussed presumptions regarding the validity of arbitration agreements.  In syllabus point 3 of that decision 
we stated:"
1213,3," . It is presumed that an arbitration provision in a written contract was bargained for and that arbitration was intended to be 
the exclusive means of resolving disputes arising under the contract; however, where a party alleges that the arbitration 
provision was unconscionable or was thrust upon him because he was unwary and taken advantage of, or that the contract 
was one of adhesion, the question of whether an arbitration provision was bargained for and valid is a matter of law for the 
court to determine by reference to the entire contract, the nature of the contracting parties, and the nature of the 
undertakings covered by the contract. "
1214,," Id., at 440-441. With respect to restrictive covenants, the analogy goes, HN12[
] it is presumed that a restrictive covenant in a written contract 
was bargained for and that the restrictive covenant was intended to be the exclusive means of resolving the problem of 
""purloined trade assets""; however, where a party alleges that the restrictive covenant is unconscionable or was thrust upon him 
because he was unwary and taken advantage of, or that the contract was one of adhesion, the question of whether a restrictive 
covenant is reasonable and valid is a matter of law for the court to determine by reference to the entire contract, the nature of 
the contracting parties, and the nature of the undertakings covered by the contract."
1214,9," Professor Blake's superb law review article examines this dilemma and endorses a similar principle: If the court is persuaded that the employer's policy and practice with respect to employee restraints generally is fair and 
designed only to protect legitimate interests, the court should tailor the covenant to provide such protection with a minimum 
burden to the employee.  When it seems likely that the employer exacts the restriction for whatever advantage he can get 
from limiting the employees' mobility and bargaining power, or that he has not accorded employees' interests sufficient 
weight in devising and administering the restraints, severance should be denied.  Courts should not aid and abet a grasping 
or negligent employer by reforming an unreasonably restrictive agreement. Blake, supra, at 683-684."
1214,10,"  ""The purpose of enforcing covenants not to compete is to prevent the employee from stealing the employer's good will, not 
to enable the employer to steal the employee's good will.  Each party is entitled to keep the good will and reputation he 
would have had if he had never made a contract with this particular litigant . . . ."" Corbin on Contracts, § 1391B (Kaufman Supp. 1982). "
1215,11," We note that, in a case very similar to ours, but lacking the same overlay of public interest, a court has held a restrictive 
covenant invalid where it would require the physician to remove himself from the community in which he had made substantial 
investment, since there was a compelling need for the physician's service.  To uphold the covenant, the court said, would be to 
jeopardize the public health.  Damsey v. Mankowitz, 339 So.2d 282, (Fla. App. 1976).  To the extent that the hardship to the 
doctor determined the court's decision, we find the decision unsound. Professor Corbin reminds us that ""disproportionate hardship to the party against whom enforcement is sought has always been 
regarded as a reason for refusing equitable remedies."" A. L. Corbin, Contracts, § 1394, at 101.  However, in between the 
hardship of an inherently unreasonable covenant, from which an employee is protected by our threshold analysis, supra, and the 
normal hardship that is the purposeful result of an anticompetitive covenant, there is little room to find ""disproportionate 
hardship."" As we discuss, supra, these covenants provide an incentive for an employee to stay at work for the employer.  This incentive is 
the hardship of a move.  As the Supreme Court of New Jersey has recently pointed out, HN16[
] ""a mere showing of personal 
hardship does not amount to an 'undue hardship' that would prevent enforcement of the covenant."" Karlin v. Weinberg, 77 N.J. 
408, 417-418 n. 3, 390 A.2d 1161, 1166 n. 3 (1978). "
1216,12," Commonly, when an ex-employee is enjoined from competing with his old employer, the public concern is the withdrawal of 
that employee's skills from the marketplace.  Here, the Foundation argues, permitting Dr. Reddy to violate the covenant and 
practice medicine in the community of Man would work to the detriment of the community's medical services, since the existence 
of the Foundation is essential to the provision of quality medical care in the community, and Dr. Reddy's competition would 
threaten the Foundation's survival.  We thus have the party against whom the policy is commonly asserted, namely the 
employer, asserting it itself in this case."
1216,13," The Preston County Health Council is an organization comparable to the Community Health Foundation of Man, and performs 
a similar service for Preston County to that which the Foundation provides for Logan County."
1216,14," In this regard, we take judicial notice of the federal grants to the Foundation, and are willing to accept the grants as evidence 
of the merits of the Foundation's public purpose.  We also take judicial notice that there is a very real health care problem in 
Southern West Virginia. "
1217,15," We are not the first court to find public health questions dispositive in a restrictive covenant dispute.  See Odess v. Taylor, 282 
Ala. 389, 211 So.2d 805, where the court refused to uphold a covenant because of a shortage of ear, nose and throat specialists 
in the restricted area.  We may, however, be the first court to endorse upholding such a covenant on those grounds. "

nature.  The Court will expect further elaboration on this issue."

1229,9," The plaintiffs in Westborough Mall stated a claim under the antitrust lawsuit which was remanded for trial as well.  This 
circumstance leads the Court to believe that the plaintiff should be allowed to maintain both claims despite defendants' vigorous 
argument that the antitrust claim precludes the civil rights claim based on the same set of facts.  The Court believes that these 
claims are separate and distinct and that the antitrust laws have not supplanted the actions under 42 U.S.C.  § 1983. "

1237,2," HN2[
] Such uses of monopoly power to restrict or eliminate competition or competitors permit an inference to be drawn of intent to monopolize, which Section 2 requires in actual monopolization cases.  Specific intent to monopolize need not be 
established.  The plaintiffs need only prove general intent, that is that the defendant intended to engage in the practices which 
reduced competition.  See Von Kalinowski, 3 Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, § 8.02[4], at 8-41 -- 8-64 (1982) (collected 
cases)."
1237,3," The relevant market consists of two parts -- the product market and the geographic market.  The relevant product market 
consists of the goods and/or services with which defendant's product competes.  The relevant geographic market is the 
geographic area of effective competition in which the defendant's product is traded.  Id. at § 8.02[2], 8-8 -- 8-30."
1237,4," The district court concluded that other media -- suburban newspapers, shoppers, handbills, news magazines, television and 
radio -- are sufficiently different in purpose, content, technique and audience appeal to constitute a separate product market.  
Moreover, it determined that none of the other media alone or in combination are an adequate substitute for the metropolitan 
daily newspaper."
1237,5," The district court based this finding on the fact that between eighty and eighty-four percent of the Star's newspapers are 
delivered to readers within those seven counties."
1237,6," Vertical integration is the inclusion within a single firm of two or more stages in the production or distribution of an end product.  
A firm integrates ""downstream"" or ""forward"" when it undertakes further processing or distribution of a product that has been or 
could be sold to independent producers or distributors. The key difference between vertical integration by a competitive firm and 
vertical integration by a monopolist is that monopoly at one stage of the production-distribution process may carry with it the 
power to affect competition in earlier or later stages.  Areeda & Turner, 3 Antitrust Laws, paras. 723-725 (1978)."
1237,7," Concerted refusals to deal, of course, are generally per se violative of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. 
Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959); Sullivan, Antitrust §§ 83 et seq. (1977). "

71 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1982), and Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843 (6th Cir. 1979), involved challenges by independent 
newspaper carriers to the decisions by alleged monopoly newspapers to directly deliver their own product and to eliminate 
independent carriers. In Auburn News Co. v. Providence Journal Co., supra, 659 F.2d at 278, the Court found no Sherman Act 
violation because the refusal to deal did not reduce competition in the delivery market.  In Byars v. Bluff City News Co., supra, 
609 F.2d at 864, the Court remanded the matter to the district court to determine whether the newspaper enjoyed a monopoly in 
the relevant market."
1238,9," The Star and amicus concede that these anticompetitive effects of vertical integration are theoretically possible but they 
contend that none are produced by the Star's decision to exclusively sell and deliver its own newspapers. The record does not 
support this contention.  See slip op., infra, at 328-332. "

1243,12," The defendant's motivation is relevant because it may reveal the absence or secondary importance of socially beneficial 
reasons for a vertically integrated monopolist's refusal to deal.  Note, Refusals to Deal by Vertically Integrated Monopolists, 87 
Harv. L. Rev. 1720, 1724 (1979). The district court, while holding the Star's action unlawful, did agree that the company had 
certain legitimate business reasons for its refusal to deal.  It found: The new system would give the company control over pricing to the subscriber, thereby being able to advertise subscription 
prices, which is quite impossible where carriers largely determine the ultimate specific prices.  It would permit the company 
to assure more rapid ""starts"" for new subscribers, and would allow uniform policy regarding time of collection, manner of 
payment by customers, and method of responding to customer complaints, all of which have been problems under the 
independent contract carrier system.  These findings are not clearly erroneous; however, they do not fully summarize the evidence concerning the Star's reasons for 
proposing to eliminate the independent carriers. See infra, at 331-332. "
1245,13," See Hardin v. Houston Chronicle Publishing Co., 434 F. Supp. 54 (S.D. Tex. 1977), aff'd, 572 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir. 1978) (per

1979), are both distinguishable from this case because the defendants did not possess monopoly power in the relevant market, 
as well as because the plaintiffs did not utilize refusal to deal theories."
1245,14," None of the cases relied on by the Star held that vertical integration by a newspaper publisher into the delivery market is lawful 
regardless of its competitive consequences.  Indeed, they suggest quite the contrary.  For example, in Hardin v. Houston 
Chronicle Publishing Co., supra, 434 F. Supp. at 57, the court stated: ""the change in the method of distribution does not violate 
the antitrust laws. The new distribution system will not have any anticompetitive effects."" The First Circuit in Auburn News Co. v. 
Providence Journal Co., supra, 659 F.2d at 278, also indicated that the publisher's vertical integration would violate the Sherman 
Act if it had ""adverse consequences on competition."" The clear implication of the other decision relied on by the Star is the 
same.  See slip op., supra, at note 13."
1245,15," The Clayton Act, HN9[
] 15 U.S.C. § 26, authorizes a private cause of action for injunctive relief against ""threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws * * *."" "
1246,16," Although under the existing system any change of carriers is subject to the Star's approval, the company concedes that it has 
regularly approved such changes.  Appellees Br. at 38-39, n. 34. "
1247,17," This $2.5 million award was for the services provided by the law firm of Morris, Larson, King, Stumper & Bold (Morris firm) 
which represented virtually all of the independent carriers in this case.  The district court also granted fee awards of $1,830 and 
$1,500 to two other law firms, each of whom nominally represented two carriers. The Star does not challenge the latter two 
awards on appeal. "
1248,18," The parties, of course, stipulated to the base attorneys' fee for time expended after September 24, 1977.  The Star also does 
not challenge the district court's determination of the appropriate attorney time expended or hourly rates for the period before 
that date.  Instead, the Star contends that the plaintiffs are entitled to no compensation for attorneys' fees prior to September 24, 
1977, because that work was for matters independent from the instant action.  We have already rejected this contention. "
1250,19," The Supreme Court stated: We do not read that Rule [54(d)] as giving district judges unrestrained discretion to tax costs to reimburse a winning litigant 
for every expense he has seen fit to incur in the conduct of his case.  Items proposed by winning parties as costs should 
always be given careful scrutiny * * *. Therefore the discretion given district judges to tax costs should be sparingly 
exercised with reference to expenses not specifically allowed by statute.  Such a restrained administration of the Rule is in 
harmony with our national policy of reducing insofar as possible the burdensome cost of litigation.  Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., 379 U.S. 227, 235, 13 L. Ed. 2d 248, 85 S. Ct. 411 (1964)."
1250,20," The plaintiffs here did not seek approval from the district court to introduce their expert testimony.  HN20[

courts have found that expert witness fees may be awarded only if the party employing experts has made prior application to 
tender that testimony, e.g., Cagle v. Cox, 87 F.R.D. 467, 471 (E.D. Va. 1980), the majority of courts have not required such prior 
application.  E.g., Roberts v. S.S. Kyriakoula D. Lemos, 651 F.2d 201, 205-207 (3d Cir. 1981); Welsch v. Likins, 68 F.R.D. 589, 
597-598 (D. Minn. 1975), aff'd, 525 F.2d 987 (8th Cir. 1975) (per curiam).  We also decline to adopt a prior approval 
requirement. "

v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d 843, 862 (6th Cir. 1980). "
1252,2," These findings are based in part on evidence that the Star reserved the rights to sell directly to customers and to cancel 
independent carrier contracts on four days notice.  As noted by the district court, however, the evidence suggests that in one 
year the Star sold directly to only about 200 customers out of a total circulation of about 330,000.  It was also observed that the 
Star ""exercised the right to sell direct, . . . only once, probably, against the wishes of the carriers."""
1252,3," It has been suggested that one of the factors to consider in determining the consequences of vertical integration is the degree 
of competition between the two levels.  Note, Refusals to Deal by Vertically Integrated Monopolists, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1720, 1726 
(1974). That is, the higher the degree of competition between the two levels, the lesser the benefit to be anticipated by vertical 
integration. Given the minimum degree of competition, or potential competition, between the Star and the independent carriers, 
one might expect little by way of adverse effect of forward integration."
1252,4," The fact that the Star would have control over the price is not by itself a violation of antitrust law.  Hardin v. Houston Chronicle 
Publishing Co., 434 F. Supp. 54, 57 (S.D. Tex. 1977), aff'd, 572 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir. 1978)."
1252,5," A survey of cases reveals the emphasis placed on finding a barrier to first-level entry.  See, e.g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United 
States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973) (monopoly power company not only refused to sell wholesale to

180 F. Supp. 125 (D. Mass. 1959), modified, 284 F.2d 582 (1st Cir. 1960)."
1253,7," The majority correctly notes, supra at n.8, that the court in Auburn News found no antitrust violation because there was no 
reduction of competition in the delivery market.  The court's conclusion was based on the finding that independent dealers 
operated in exclusive territories, as in this case, and did not compete with one another.  It is not clear from the opinion in Auburn 
News whether the newspaper publisher retained the right, under its independent dealer distribution system, to sell directly to 
consumers.  Common sense suggests, however, that such a reservation would be advisable to protect the publisher by allowing 
direct sales in certain circumstances, for example at the request of an independent dealer or when a dealer fails to deliver to its 
subscribers. "
1254,," The majority also finds Newberry inapposite as not involving an alleged refusal to deal.  See supra at 19.  The court in that case, 
however, discussed the antitrust ramifications of the change in distribution system and, in finding no violation, stated ""[a] dealer 
system imposed by this Court would amount to undue interference with the seller's right to fashion the manner in which he 
chooses to sell his own product."" 438 F. Supp. at 485."
1254,8," The present case can be distinguished from the following cases in which antitrust violations were found.  In Otter Tail Power 
Co. v. United States, supra, a monopoly power company's refusal to sell wholesale to certain municipalities or to ""wheel"" power 
from other wholesalers resulted in evasion of first-level profit regulation and erected barriers to first-level entry by other 
wholesalers.  In addition, the company apparently initiated a program of harassing litigation to protect its monopoly position.  In 
Eastman Kodak Co. of New York v. Southern Photo Materials Co., supra, the Court, although focusing on the issue of 
monopolistic intent, noted the absence of business justifications for defendant's refusal to deal.  273 U.S. at 375. Similarly, in 
Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service Corp., 431 F.2d 334 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 912, 27 L. Ed. 2d 
811, 91 S. Ct. 880 (1971), a monopoly producer and national distributor of motion picture advertising accessories refused to deal 
with a local distributor. The district court's finding of an antitrust violation was held to be supported by the absence of sound 
business reasons and defendant's ""grossly predatory practices."" Id. at 340-41."
1254,9," Given the overall result reached by the majority the award of attorney fees is appropriate.  However, I would adhere to the 
traditional American rule, supra at 31, and disallow expert witness fees over and above the statutory allowances provided in 28 
U.S.C. § 1821. "
1260,100, The Court will of course discuss the plaintiffs' contention later. 
1262,101," Marginal costs are variable costs divided by output; average total costs, which is the benchmark that SPCC contends is 
appropriate, are the sum of fixed and variable costs divided by output.  (Pl. July 15, 1982, Post-Trial Memo of Law at 31-32)."
1262,102, The principal difference between the two is the relevant market. 
1263,103," AT & T's costing methods evolved over time from ""current costs"" to ""full additional costs"" to LRIC.  All three of these methods 
were based upon the same underlying principles, and the change from one to the other appears to the Court to reflect a 
continuing effort by AT & T to improve its procedures (see Froggatt, S-T-2 at 7-14, 29-42; Eastmond, S-T-11 at 13-25; Baumol, 
S-T-4 at 12-16)."
1263,104," As the term suggests, ""variable costs"" are costs that vary with changes in output.  Variable costs typically include such items 
as materials, fuel, labor and maintenance.  The sum of all variable costs divided by output yields average variable cost. 3 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 715(c) (1978).  In contrast to variable costs, fixed costs are those costs which do not vary 
with changes in output.  When fixed costs are added to total variable costs, the sum is a firm's total cost, and that total divided by 
output yields average total cost (id. at P 712)."
1263,105," During the period of extended regulatory uncertainty leading up to the Docket No. 18128 decision, and thereafter pursuant to 
that decision, AT & T also conducted various fully distributed cost (""FDC"") studies in support of its private line rate adjustments 
(see generally Johnston, S-T-5 at 9-42). Fully distributed cost is an accounting concept focusing on the historical costs reflected 
in the books of the company.  Fully distributed costs require an allocation of the firm's total costs to the firm's various product 
lines.  However, unlike the concept of average total cost, which has sound economic underpinnings when defined as average 
incremental cost, the allocation methods used to compute fully distributed cost are inherently arbitrary and have no economic 
basis (Baumol, S-T-4 at 8-9, 36, U.S. Tr. 23153-65; Olley, S-T-29 at 16-17; Braeutigam, S-T-204 at 13-17; Tr. 5018, 5020; 
Arrow, S-T-30 at 5). "
1264,106," One case that in certain circumstances permits a deviation from marginal cost is Wm. Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT 
Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981). As an alternative to proving pricing below marginal cost, Inglis would 
permit plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by showing, first that a defendant reduced its prices to a level below average total 
cost and second, ""that the anticipated benefits of the prices, at the time they were set, depended on their anticipated destructive 
effect upon competition and the consequent enhanced market position of the defendant"" (668 F.2d at 1034). It is clear from 
Inglis itself, however, that that case provides no support for plaintiffs here.  First, SPCC has not shown AT & T's prices were 
below its average total cost.  Second, as the Court discusses more fully below, the ""intent"" documents upon which SPCC relies 
cannot be read as evidencing an anticompetitive intent, and thus do not fall within the situation addressed in Inglis. Indeed, in 
Inglis, the Court of Appeals held that a conclusive showing of anticompetitive intent had not been made even though a 
consultant's report to defendant proposed several pricing strategies aimed at putting pressure on less efficient competitors, and 
other internal documents indicated that the defendant's goal was ""market dominance."" In the Ninth Circuit's view, the first of 
these documents indicated no more than a ""recommendation of intensified price competition"" and the others added ""little that 
would suggest unlawful intent"" ( id. at 1039). Even Inglis, therefore, which stands alone as the most lenient test adopted by any 
appellate court, requires much more rigorous proof than merely showing that prices below average total costs were 
accompanied by an intent to compete and a recognition that competition would be hard on less efficient competitors."
1264,107," In its brief, the government stated: ""The Commission has now adopted the umbrellas pricing which seven years ago it properly rejected as contrary to the 
public interest.  It did so without a clear explanation of why the public will benefit from this stultification of competition. The Commission's fully-distributed cost approach requires that the fixed or general costs be allocated among all services in 
proportion ""to the investment and expenses that had been directly attributable to the services."" . . .  Costs of capital will also 
be so allocated, . . ., so that each service is required to earn a rate of return equal to that of the over-all company rate of 
return . . . . AT & T is the predominant supplier of telecommunications services, enjoying tremendous advantages due to its size and 
established name recognition.  The prices it charges will affect the prices charged by the competing specialized carriers 
because it is the dominant firm in a concentrated market with high barriers to entry.  The Commission here is imposing a 
rigid rate-making standard that will impede significant price competition. AT & T, subject to extremely narrow waiver 
provisions, will as a practical matter have virtually no freedom to price a service any differently than it prices its basic 
monopoly services, notwithstanding possible efficiencies. Long-run incremental cost pricing, by contrast, is not only procompetitive but aids the users of services for which there is 
not competition. (Emphasis supplied).  (footnotes omitted) (S-5716 at 34-35). "
1265,108," Indeed, although SPCC in this case attacks LRIC, Mr. Grant, SPCC's President, was advised in connection with the filing of 
AT & T's Hi/Lo tariff that ""the concept of using a variable or incremental cost should be condoned by SPC, due to SPT's 
[Southern Pacific Transportation's] reliance on variable costing"" (S-67)."
1265,109," In a brief filed in the Supreme Court of the United States on April 10, 1968, of which Southern Pacific, by Thormond A. Miller, 
was a signatory, an Association of American Railroads stated (S-1822C at 12): ""What the appellants, by advocating the use of fully distributed cost floors, are seeking is not the recognition and 
preservation of inherent advantages, but the establishment of artificial and uneconomic pricing restraints which will deny the 
railroads the right to enjoy their inherent cost advantage and to thereby compete effectively with other modes.  And, more 
importantly, the position of the appellants will deprive the public of the benefits of competition in the form of lower 
transportation charges."" The Brief went on to state (id. at 34): Briefly, it is elementary economics that in determining the wisdom of making a price reduction of an individual service to 
respond to competition, the only relevant cost is incremental cost or, as that term is used here, out of pocket cost."""
1265,110," 49 U.S.C. § 10701a(c) (2) provides: A rate for transportation by a rail carrier that equals or exceeds the variable cost of providing the transportation is 
conclusively presumed to contribute to the going concern value of such rail carriers."" "
1266,111," This document (S-2676) is a memo to Mr. Strassberg from Mr. Baker describing a meeting held on July 7, 1976. Present at 
that meeting were Mssrs. Strassberg, Ende, Griffith, Nelson, Anderson, Gerlando, and Baker whereby they reached the tentative 
conclusion that: ""Bell's LRIC studies with the related burden tests as may be modified in the decision will be acceptable in support of 
proposed future rate changes for the competitive private line services.  Any proposed set of rates must pass the burden test 
and provide revenues at least equal to LRIC."""
1266,112," This document (S-2825c) was prepared pursuant to S-2626.  This is a second draft of the working group in Docket 18128 in 
which the Commission found LRIC an appropriate costing methodology. While it is recognized that the Commission had no 
obligation to approve this second draft, as the Court has so stated previously (Tr. 4977): ""This goes to the question of one of the very elements of your case on liability . . . .  It goes to the question of intent. . . . To show there was respectable opinion that what AT & T did was not necessarily with the intent to deceive or anything else 
as you have and everybody else has charged."" "
1267,113," This view also contradicts another principal SPCC witness, Dr. Bruce Owen, who on February 14, 1972, while still at the 
Office of Telecommunications Policy wrote (S-2349 at 1): ""Communications services, like other services provided by utilities 
should ideally be priced at marginal cost."""
1267,114," In addition to Northeastern, other Courts of Appeals have rejected similar arguments focusing on the relationship between the 
challenged rates and the rates for other services offered by the defendants.  In these cases, the courts have held that it is only 
the price-cost relationship of the challenged rates which is relevant, and that rate structure concepts such as cross-subsidy or 
price discrimination are not valid measures of predatory pricing. See, e.g., Pacific Engineering & Production Co., supra, 551 F.2d 
at 798 (price discrimination argument dismissed even though there was no cost justification for the differing prices charged, 
because ""charging higher prices in another submarket does not change . . . legitimate competition into an injury to competition""); 
International Air Industries, supra, 517 F.2d at 728 (unless a firm is ""selling below marginal cost, it would have no need of aid 
from other markets and the dollar figures elsewhere would therefore be irrelevant"").  Similarly, as Professors Areeda and Turner "
1268,," have explained, even where a firm has been accused of ""'subsidizing' low returns in a competitive market with higher returns on 
a monopolized product, . . . illicit pricing can be established only by showing that in the competitive market the firm is pricing 
below marginal cost or the 'surrogate' average variable cost."" Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 721 (1975)."
1268,115," To the extent the Court does adopt a cost-based test, the plaintiffs contend that FDC should be the floor."
1268,116," Plaintiffs now, however, have taken the position that the calculations made by Mr. Scott and Mr. Tucker can be used to show 
that AT & T's rates for Hi/Lo and MPL were below cost.  The Court, therefore, has examined these calculations from that 
perspective, but for the reasons set out in more detail below, does not believe they can be accorded any weight.  The Court was 
skeptical of Mr. Scott's and Mr. Tucker's testimony when they appeared; and the testimony of AT & T witnesses, particularly Mr. 
Johnston and Mr. Ankner who were responsible for conducting the underlying studies being criticized, has convinced the Court 
that Mr. Scott and Mr. Tucker erred in several respects, with the result that they substantially overstated AT & T's costs. Scott 
and Tucker were both lacking in credibility and qualifications. "
1269,117," Although plaintiffs offered few specific criticisms of AT & T's fully distributed cost studies for Telpak, Dr. Melody did question 
the 1973 FDC Method 1 study by comparing it with the 1972 study and asserting that he was unaware of any explanation for the 
fact that while Telpak revenues increased in 1973, the dollar value of gross plant, net investment and expenses decreased 
(Melody, Tr. 5596-99).  This criticism was raised first in rebuttal, and it is the Court's opinion that Dr. Melody had not really 
analyzed the study he purported to criticize.  Thus, it appears that there are at least several possible explanations for this 
phenomenon of which Dr. Melody evidenced no thorough consideration -- including a 1972 Telpak rate increase; a continuing 
decline over time in AT & T's average embedded investment per circuit mile; retirements in AT & T's older, higher cost plant; and 
the use of a new Redcap (or facilities inventory) analysis (Melody, Tr. 5608-10, 5649-53).  Moreover, the Court is unpersuaded 
by Dr. Melody's attempt to show an inconsistency between the 1973 FDC Method 1 Telpak study and the 1973 FDC Method 1 
study for a category entitled Private Line Telephone.  Dr. Melody's theory apparently is that since the revenue for both of these 
categories increased between 1972 and 1973, the investment and expense amounts for each of the categories should also have 
moved in the same direction.  Yet, Dr. Melody himself conceded that up to half the investment in the Private Line Telephone 
category consisted of equipment such as Autovon switches which have no comparable component in the Telpak category and 
that it was possible that this difference accounted for the difference in results (Melody, Tr. 5607-09, 5648-49).  Moreover, from 
the Court's review of the record, when Telpak results are compared with more comparable studies, such as the Hi/Lo rate 
element study, the changes from 1972 to 1973 in the two sets of results are entirely consistent (S-2938B at 18; S-33 at 4):"

1270,118," Plaintiffs rely on a collection of documents pre-dating the commencement of their operations as purported proof of below cost 
pricing of Telpak.  The Court does not believe that documents from this early time period can establish predatory pricing for 
purposes of this case, and indeed the Court has previously dismissed plaintiffs' charges against AT & T's Multiple Channel and 
Series 11000 tariffs for this reason.  Order, May 18, 1982.  In any event, the Court is satisfied with AT & T's explanation of the 
Telpak revenue-cost relationship during the 1960s.  Thus, as explained by Mr. Hough, President of Long Lines during this 
period, and Mr. Froggatt, an AT & T Vice President responsible for cost analysis at that time, AT & T's ability to adjust the Telpak 
rates in the mid-1960s was constrained by the uncertainties resulting from the FCC's investigation of Telpak in Docket No. 
14251, the subsequent appeal of that decision and the Court-imposed stay of that decision pending appeal (Hough, S-T-1 at 33-
34; Froggatt, S-T-2 at 28-29). Within four months of the September 1966 Court of Appeals decision, however, AT & T in January 
1967 proposed rate increases to the FCC based on its continuing studies of Telpak earnings levels.  Due to extreme customer 
opposition, however, it was not until 1970 that the increases first proposed in 1967 were able to be implemented fully.  Indeed, 
when AT & T filed those increases in February 1968, it was forced to withdraw them and to substitute a lesser, so-called 
""interim"" increase, which became effective later that year, despite continuing customer opposition (Hough, S-T-1 at 35-38; see 
also Telpak User Support Doc. Sub. at 5-12).  Even then AT & T continued studying the Telpak rates, and in 1971 proposed 
another increase, which, over substantial customer opposition, became effective in 1972 (Hough, S-T-1 at 38; see also Telpak 
User Support Doc. Sub. at 12-14).  In the Court's view, AT & T's actions in this context were both reasonable and responsible 
and in no event support plaintiffs' predatory pricing claim. "
1271,119," Despite the showing that the rates selected for filing in 1969 (Test Rate 3) would cover relevant costs and generate 
substantial additional contribution, plaintiffs have contended that AT & T should have selected an even higher rate (Test Rate 4) 
for filing.  As Mr. Hough explained, however, AT & T at that time faced substantial practical constraints both in terms of customer 
pressure and the time available for additional studies, and it was his opinion that Test Rate 3 was the optimum rate to file 
(Hough, S-T-1 at 36-37).  The Court can find no basis upon which to second-guess Mr. Hough's testimony on this point, and as 
discussed in more detail below, the Court does not accept plaintiffs' profit maximization theory in the context of this case.  
Finally, whatever can be said about the 1969 increases, the Court finds it difficult to infer predatory pricing when AT & T shortly 
thereafter proposed still an additional increase.  Indeed, this emphasizes the position that AT & T was in, unlike other 
businesses that can raise and lower their prices on a ""whim"", AT & T always had to receive permission from the appropriate 
regulatory body before they would raise or lower their prices."
1271,120," See, e.g., PX2-0164, which appears to relate to losses to competition, not to the earnings level of Telpak. This October 3, 
1974 letter to Mr. Betteridge from Mr. Parker stated, ""A principal source of concern regarding a delay in filing HiPak is the 
impending significant losses of our Telpak market."" (Emphasis supplied)."
1271,121," See, e.g., PX2-0171 at 20, which for the years 1973 and 1974 shows annual revenues over embedded direct costs of $ 111 
million and $ 122 million respectively."
1271,122," One other claim made by plaintiffs is that materials filed by AT & T in 1980 in connection with the termination of Telpak 
indicated that Telpak would fail the burden test if it were continued in 1981.  As the Court understands it, however, the reason 
that AT & T decided to terminate Telpak was because a change in FCC policy undercut the premises upon which Telpak was 
based (Hough, S-T-1 at 38), and the Court therefore cannot discern how projections under these changed conditions have any 
bearing on the lawfulness of the rates established under the previous FCC policy.  Moreover, in light of the restrictive conditions 
of the injunction requiring AT & T to continue Telpak in effect, it would be understandable if Telpak's revenue-cost relationship 
deteriorated at some point after 1977. "
1272,123," These 1973 and 1974 studies confirmed AT & T's expectations that the costs for its high-density corridors were dropping, and 
thus the data used in the original Hi/Lo FDC study (1969 data updated to 1972) was a conservative measure of actual costs for 
the service (Johnston, S-T-5 at 61, 64). "
1273,124," In response to the question of whether AT & T attempted to influence his work in the Government case, Mr. Morrison 
responded (S-T-20 at Tab B, Tr. 22997), ""They made no attempt to influence our work.  This is our work and independently done 
and represents Peat, Marwick's efforts."" With the Peat name behind this study, the Court is satisfied that there was in fact 
complete independence in performing this study."
1273,125," It must be pointed out that the plaintiffs experts are generally former FCC employees and therefore their independence is 
suspect.  Moreover, they are not subject to the same stringent code of ethics that Mr. Morrison is, as a partner in Peat, Marwick. "
1276,126," The Court is addressing this question of AT & T's rates in the 1960s only because it appeared to the Court to have been a 
major part of plaintiffs' theory of pricing without regard to cost.  AT & T's rates in the 1960s are of so little relevance to the 
question to be decided here that but for plaintiffs' insistence, it would have been omitted entirely from this analysis. "
1277,127," These after-the-fact criticisms were made despite the fact that Dr. Melody and Messrs. Scott and Tucker were former FCC 
employees who were thus in a position to have their positions implemented.  With respect to Dr. Melody, the Court can only 
assume that he presented his position to the staff while at the FCC and was rebuffed.  It is claimed that neither Mr. Scott or Mr. 
Tucker had occasion to work on AT & T tariffs while at the FCC. Yet their criticisms of the AT & T cost studies are conceptual 
and thus applicable (or should be) to all cost studies.  Thus, the Court again assumes that these concepts were brought to the 
FCC's attention and they were rebuffed.  To the extent that these concepts were not brought out at the Commission merely 
evidences ""Monday-morning quarterbacking"" which this Court will not countenance. "
1278,128," Indeed what plaintiffs have failed to account for in its but-for-world is that AT & T would have received approval to institute the 
higher but-for-rate."
1278,129," After more than 21 years, the Commission never made a definitive ruling on the structure of Telpak."
1278,130," Mr. Scott, one of plaintiffs' cost experts testified as follows (Tr. 2017). Q.  In the MPL decision did the Commission ever make a filing (sic) that AT & T failed to adhere to the cost manuals of January 
1977 or August 1977? A.  Not that I can recall. "
1281,131," The record shows that this procedure of estimating certain Bell operating company costs from Long Lines costs was 
explained to the FCC in the early 1960s and that AT & T provided documentation to the FCC staff showing that operating 
company costs per circuit mile were in fact comparable to Long Lines costs per circuit mile for the same type of circuit (PX2-
0021; PX2-0022). "
1282,132," Although Dr. Melody now criticizes the capacity cost concept, and testified that he also did so during conferences with AT & T 
economists in 1969 (Tr. 5571-73), notes of those conferences flatly contradict Dr. Melody's testimony.  Thus, notes of a June 10, 
1969 conference reflect that Mr. Killoch of AT & T made a presentation regarding the capacity cost concept and that Dr. Melody 
reacted quite favorably, stating: ""The model seems to be extremely useful and provides good insight into the problem.  It takes 
into consideration the fact that investment decisions depend on price, and presents the value of 'timing' of investment decisions. 
I am very optimistic about this approach and I must say that the model is good and you are also a good teacher"" (S-1905B at 2).  
These notes confirm the Court's already stated view regarding Dr. Melody's apparent lack of objectivity and credibility."
1282,133," Although plaintiffs attempted to attack Mr. Ankner's actual incremental fill calculation on cross-examination, it is the Court's 
opinion that Mr. Ankner adequately responded to each of the issues raised and was both an extremely convincing and credible 
witness who had devoted a substantial portion of his professional career to cost analysis.  Thus, with respect to the treatment of 
L5 coaxial cable in his analysis, Mr. Ankner testified that the fill of the getting started cost was treated as L5 because these 
systems were being constructed to serve ultimately as L5; that the electronics were included as L4 or L3 where the systems 
were first used as such; and that, most importantly, these systems could have been treated entirely as L4, with later conversion 
to L5, with no effect on the final result (Ankner, Tr. 4679-82).  And when questioned about how the incremental fill on certain 
facilities could be in excess of 100 percent, Mr. Ankner explained that incremental fill is the ratio of the additional revenue 
producing circuit miles over the additional capacity, and therefore an incremental fill of over 100 percent could result from 
additional demand being served without any addition of capacity.  In such a situation, another way of approaching the problem 
would be to treat the existing facilities as having an incremental cost of zero, and when averaged over time the result would be 
the same as the approach used by Mr. Ankner (Ankner, Tr. 4685-88). "
1283,134," To the extent that plaintiffs are also relying on the Scott and Tucker calculations as evidence of Telpak costs, the calculations 
are entitled to even less weight.  Plaintiffs' theory in this respect is apparently based on the fact that the cost of any one 
particular circuit is the same regardless of the tariff under which it is sold.  This simplistic notion, however, fails to account for the 
fact that, overall, the circuits sold under Telpak have had different physical and cost characteristics than the circuits sold under 
the single-channel tariffs. Thus, for example, Telpak circuits as a whole differed from single-channel circuits in terms of route-to-
air ratio, length of haul, and facility mix, all of which result in differences in the service costs of Telpak as compared to the single-
channel offerings (Johnston, Tr. 3860-61; Froggatt, Tr. 3718-19; PX3-0325)."
1283,135," The absurdity of these high cost numbers is apparent to the Court when juxtaposed against SPCC's ""but-for"" weighted 
average prices for private line.  (PX5-0145).  Not until the third quarter of 1984 does AT & T even charge a $ 1.71 in the ""but-for"" 
world and the second quarter of 1986 for the $ 1.77 figure."
1283,136," This is contrary to the testimony of Mr. Morrison of Peat, Marwick who testified that ""the underlying data and procedures were 
available from AT & T to conduct a proper cost study.  (S-T-20 at 10). "
1284,137," In the Court's view, the Scott and Tucker calculations were inconsistent with each other in other critical respects.  Mr. Scott, 
for instance, was not sure why Mr. Tucker's average revenue per mile for the high-density portion of Hi/Lo in his study was $ 
1.33, while Mr. Scott's was $ 1.42 (Scott, Tr. 2025-26).  But then, after asserting that a disparity in revenue figures would 
account for a difference between the two studies, Mr. Scott was unable to explain why, when he and Mr. Tucker used similar 
average revenue for a certain air band, the results were a monthly FDC figure of $ .59 per mile and a monthly LRIC figure of $ 
.91 per mile (Scott, Tr. 2035).  He admitted, however, that this unexplained difference of approximately 50 percent was 
significant (Scott, Tr. 2036-37).  He finally conceded that such inconsistencies mean ""you can do anything with numbers if you 
want to"" (Scott, Tr. 2026). "
1285,138," On cross-examination, plaintiffs also tried to create the impression that Mr. Johnston erred in his calculation of expense 
factors and that he omitted certain costs associated with test board equipment.  As the Court understands it, however, the entire 
point regarding the expense factors is related to the extent of change in the facilities mix between Mr. Tucker's and the original 
AT & T studies, and, as Mr. Johnston explained, the change was so small as to be miniscule (Johnston, Tr. 3855).  And with 
respect to test board equipment, Mr. Johnston testified that in his corrections to Mr. Tucker's adjustments he used exactly the 
same station terminal costs as in the original MPL studies (Johnston, Tr. 3846-47), which studies clearly indicated that test 
boards were included in the station terminal costs (S-176 at 3-56)."
1285,139," The Court previously has addressed the issues of fill and translator development.  With respect to AT & T's use of average 
expense to investment ratios, the Court finds that this was a reasonable procedure based upon studies showing a high 
correlation of expenses to investment over time and sensitivity tests showing that the use of past relationships would continue to 
hold in the future (Eastmond, S-T-11 at 33-35; McCarthy, S-T-7 at 7-9; Ankner, S-T-5 at 23-24; Ankner, S-T-5A at 7-9; Olley, S-
T-29 at 40-42; S-2038 at 31-33, 87-88; S-1905).  With respect to the treatment of inflation, the Court believes that AT & T's 
practice of reflecting only known inflationary increases was consistent with what the Court understands to be traditional 
regulatory practice and was supported by AT & T's long record of productivity gains which historically more than compensated 
for inflationary increases (Eastmond, S-T-11 at 49; Ankner, S-T-10 at 24-25; Ambrose, S-T-17 at 48-50; Olley, S-T-29 at 19-21, 
41).  Moreover, the Court notes that at the time the Hi/Lo tariff was filed, regulations of the Wage and Price Commission 
prohibited public utilities from reflecting anticipated inflation when seeking rate increases (see Price Commission Regulations 
Doc. Sub.)."
1285,140," The principal point brought out by plaintiffs in cross-examination was that for certain aspects of his correction calculations Mr. 
Ankner used a five-year period beginning one year later than the period Mr. Scott used.  As Mr. Ankner explained, however, he 
had actual data available for the period he used, and he believed it was a truer test of the validity of the projections in his original 
1972 study to compare them against actual results than to use indices as Mr. Scott did (Ankner, Tr. 4700-01, 4704).  The Court 
finds Mr. Ankner's approach to be both sensible and persuasive. "
1286,141," Plaintiffs' reliance on American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. v. American Broadcasting -- Paramount Theatres, Inc., 
388 F.2d 272 (2d Cir. 1967), and on Advance Business Sys. & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. 
denied, 397 U.S. 920, 25 L. Ed. 2d 101, 90 S. Ct. 928 (1970), is entirely misplaced.  These cases involved a classic tying 
arrangement where the defendant was accused of using its market power over one product to coerce its customers into 
purchasing other unwanted products.  The Court does not understand any such claim to have been made against Telpak, and 
indeed the record indicates that AT & T's Telpak customers wanted AT & T to maintain Telpak, petitioned the FCC to reject AT & 
T's Telpak termination filing, and were instrumental in obtaining the injunction after AT & T decided to terminate Telpak (Telpak 
Termination Doc. Sub. at 2-3).  Plaintiffs' counsel concede as much (Tr. 2277). Similarly, White & White, Inc. v. American Hospital Supply Co., 540 F. Supp. 951, 1982-1 Trade Cas. P 64,722 (W.D. Mich. 
1982) does not support plaintiffs' claim here.  White & White held unlawful a multi-product rebate plan based on the combined 
purchase of many different types of products sold by defendant (from surgical gowns to food), only some of which were also 
supplied by plaintiffs.  The court's theory was that the combination of multiple products in a single rebate plan made it likely that 
customers would purchase only defendants' products to maximize the available rebate, even though plaintiffs offered some 
products which might be superior (id. at 540 F. Supp. 951). The decision, thus, has nothing to do with bulk discounts of a single 
product, such as Telpak, and the court there specifically noted that if the volume discount terms ""were limited to a single broad 
product submarket category . . . no apparent injury to competition would result"" ( id. at 1005). "
1287,142," As discussed below, the evidence shows in fact that SPCC has been very successful in selling circuits, particularly bulk 
circuits, to AT & T's Telpak customers. "
1288,143," This is the testimony of Roger G. Bruhn of Lockheed Aircraft Co. in 1962 (Docket 14251) wherein he stated (at 13): ""We would undoubtedly look to more widespread use of private microwave if TELPAK did not provide common carrier 
facilities on an economically competitive basis."""
1288,144," This is the testimony of Mr. Norman J. Ream also of Lockheed Aircraft Co. in 1962 (Docket 14251) who buttressed Mr. 
Bruhn's testimony wherein he stated (at 29): ""There is no doubt in my mind whatever that in the absence of a common carrier offering such as TELPAK we would rely 
more and more upon private microwave facilities.  This would be so because under those conditions, and as requirements 
such as bulk data processing increases, the only feasible method for handling these requirements within a realistic 
economic framework would be private microwave."
1288,145," Mr. J. S. Anderson of ARINC testified in Docket 14251 on September 5, 1962, that (at 30-2): ""The principal thing we did was to confront the Telephone Company with the fact that the airline industry could construct 
and operate its own nationwide private microwave communications system at substantially lower costs than that obtainable 
under existing private line tariffs. . . . "
1289,," The ownership, operation and maintenance of radio stations is our main business and our experience with microwave 
stations has been very good.  We have no doubts on the technical capability of private microwave systems to meet the 
airline requirements."
1289,146," In the testimony of John T. Magee of Arthur D. Little Company, Docket 14251 (December 13, 1961), Mr. Magee concluded (at 
33, 34): ""We conclude that TELPAK rates are generally in the competitive cost range with private microwave systems. While one 
alternative or the other may show a cost advantage in particular circumstances and, while cost is only one of the factors 
which must be taken into account in any comparison, the existence of the TELPAK service means that we as systems 
analysts would have to consider both TELPAK and private systems carefully in the light of specific circumstances to decide 
which to use. We could not rule one or the other out of consideration simply on the basis of costs. We forecast a substantial growth in the demand for bulk communications services.  A generally competitively priced 
common carrier service available to the bulk communications users will permit the company carriers to compete for the bulk 
market we forecast.  The absence of this choice will force users to turn away from the common carriers on a price basis. 
The availability of a common carrier service will stimulate development of bulk communications systems in total.  (Emphasis 
supplied)."" Faced with such independent analysis that AT & T would lose a substantial number of its bulk carriers, AT & T had no choice but 
to implement a competitive rate. "
1290,147," These HN42[
] holdings by the Commission that cost justification is not required for a difference in rates are entirely 
consistent with the standards of the Sherman Act discussed above.  See Pacific Engineering & Production Co., supra, 551 F.2d 
at 798; International Air Industries, supra, 517 F.2d 714, 728."
1290,148," In 1962, for instance, Motorola, Inc., a maker of microwave equipment, claimed in an advertising circular that private 
microwave system costs were less than single channel private line rates with only twenty-four channels of service (S-1571B)."
1290,149," The Court notes that a private microwave system would be built with X amount of capacity, though at any given time the 
owner would not be using all of the available capacity.  Thus, any additional circuit needs would in essence be ""free"" and, thus 
decrease the unit cost of all of the circuits in use.  Yet, a company would not build a private system without extra capacity for 
many reasons, i.e., expectant future growth and the minimum capacity of the system."
1290,150," Mr. Hough analogized the situation to one where a customer buys a five pound bag of flour and uses one pound a week.  The 
pounds of flour used in the second, third, fourth and fifth weeks are not ""free"" -- they have already been paid for in the original 
purchase. Similarly, the customer has paid for all 240 circuits in Telpak D, even if he uses only some.  When he uses his 
additional circuits, they are no more ""free"" than the fifth pound of flour in the five pound bag (Hough, S-T-1 at 30).  Thus, SPCC's 
argument that it cost the Government only an additional $ .26 per circuit mile when the Government used its spare Telpak 
channels (see Melody, PX6-0018 at 118-19), fails to consider that the Government had already paid for the channels."
1290,151," This claim is that the physical routing of the circuits priced in a TELPAK section would not necessarily follow the path selected 
by the customer for pricing purposes.  (PX2-0103 at 175; PX2-0024; PX2-0223 at 1955).  That is, the TELPAK charges were 
calculated as if all of the circuits priced in a TELPAK section travelled together over the same route between the same two 
service points.  However, there was no requirement under the tariff that any of the circuits in a TELPAK pricing section actually 
travel along the same geographic route; nor was there any requirement that the circuits priced in a TELPAK section actually 
originate or terminate at the endpoints of the section which the customer designated for pricing purposes.  (Hollis, PX6-0014 at 
11; PX2-0024)."
1290,152," A customer that had bulk communications needs between two areas of the country and decided to make the most efficient 
and economical use of a private microwave system would build such a system over the area where the bulk of his needs lie and 
interconnect with AT & T to reach the final destinations. In others a customer may have a few locations scattered in the New 
York City area as well as the Washington, D.C. area.  Each of the locations needs to be connected with the bulk of the 
telecommunications needs between the Washington, D.C. area and the New York City area. In lieu of building a private microwave system to each plant, the company's system would be built as follows. "
1291,," [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] While it is clear that Springfield, Va., Falls Church, Va., and Wheaton, Md. have communications needs with Long Island, each 
of these cities would not build a separate private microwave system to Long Island, White Plains and to Westchester.  This is 
precisely the kind of flexibility that AT & T attempted to provide.  Rather a company would build a private system over 210 miles 
between New York City and Washington, D.C. and interconnect with AT & T for the remaining portion to the final destinations.  
Without such a system (or some other bulk offering) it is undisputable that at least some of the bulk telecommunications users 
would have built their own systems thereby depriving AT & T of those added revenues (and making it a little less attractive for 
the SCC's)."
1291,153," Plaintiffs also complain that SPCC was unable to lease Telpak circuits from AT & T.  As discussed below, AT & T had no duty 
under the antitrust laws or the Specialized Common Carriers decision to lease SPCC non-essential facilities.  Moreover, AT & T 
could not have leased Telpak channels without amending or abrogating its prohibitions against resale and sharing of Telpak. In 
the context of these long-standing tariff prohibitions, and in the context of the legitimate business reasons that underlay the tariff "
1292,," prohibitions (see Boettinger, S-T-3 at 25-26), the Court finds that AT & T was under no obligation to lease Telpak circuits to the 
specialized common carriers. See Almeda Mall, Inc. v. Houston Power & Light Co., 615 F.2d 343, 352-54 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 
449 U.S. 870, 66 L. Ed. 2d 90, 101 S. Ct. 208 (1980) (the antitrust laws do not require a public utility to permit resale of its 
services). "
1293,154," In 1980, the Defense Commercial Communications Office procured approximately 45,000 of the 90,000 Government private 
line circuits, or about $ 100 million of telecommunications service (Jacobsmeyer, S-T-163 at 3; Tr. 4775). "
1294,155," SPCC also refers the Court to internal AT & T documents showing that in 1971 AT & T began to study alternative rate plans 
which might replace Telpak (PX2-0181; PX2-0051).  But, as SPCC acknowledges, the focus of the examination of alternatives to 
Telpak was to respond to the possibility that Telpak sharing would be required under the FCC's 1971 Telpak Sharing decision.  
These documents in no way indicate that AT & T at this time did not view private microwave as a realistic alternative for 
customers, and AT & T's decision to retain Telpak after the Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's Telpak Sharing 
decision in fact confirms that AT & T still believed that a common carrier alternative to private microwave was necessary."
1294,156," Plaintiffs have contended that AT & T knew that Telpak would injure the specialized carriers because of the evidence that 
plaintiffs insist shows that Telpak injured Western Union. This claim is without substance.  The evidence clearly shows that it 
was not Telpak that injured Western Union, but rather the impact of the FCC's Above 890 decision.  Indeed, in the Above 890 
proceedings, Western Union had recognized this and had taken the position that authorization of private microwave competition 
would cause Western Union to go out of business (Boettinger, S-T-3; S-16; S-1556C; S-1533)."
1294,157," It is not clear from the record how MCI expected to succeed in selling its services on that basis.  Indeed, in apparent 
recognition of this fact, SPCC deviated from the position of MCI and the FCC staff, and in its comments filed with the 
Commission, SPCC took the position that it could have additional and different bulk rates (S-3431; S-3494). "
1295,158," Although SPCC's witnesses, including Mr. Hinchman and Dr. Melody, also suggested that there was something improper 
about the nature of the deaveraging reflected in the Hi/Lo and MPL tariffs, SPCC's counsel conceded that ""we don't have any 
quarrel with that as a concept or principle, or indeed, as a competitive situation that they were confronted that should permit 
deaveraging"" (Tr. 856).  Moreover, in its Hi/Lo decision, the FCC reaffirmed its position, first set forth in the Specialized Common 
Carriers decision, that ""we shall not oppose a departure from nationwide price averaging on the part of existing carriers in 
response to direct competition . . . ."" AT & T, 55 F.C.C.2d 224, 230 (1975). "
1296,159," After argument on defendants' Rule 41(b) motion, plaintiffs conceded ""what now appears to have been an error on our part"" 
with respect to their interpretation of at least one group of AT & T documents -- those concerning a purported claim that ""AT & T 
misrepresented to the Commission in the Hi/Lo proceedings the extent of its projected 1976 losses to SCC competition"" 
(Memorandum of Southern Pacific Communications Co. Regarding Issues Raised at Oral Argument, June 21, 1982, at 12)."
1296,160," The principal basis for plaintiffs' argument appears to be the purported fact that approximately 85 percent of the circuit 
mileage under the Hi/Lo tariff was sold at the high-density rates (see PX3-0310).  Plaintiffs, however, have not shown that this is 
in any respect inconsistent with AT & T's 1971 reprice analysis, particularly since that analysis expressly did not take into 
account market effects.  Moreover, because a substantial percentage of the rate increases reflected in AT & T's analysis were 
for short haul circuits (see S-2871B at 346), it appears to the Court to be potentially misleading to make any judgment on the 
basis of circuit mileage data. "
1297,161," The remaining criteria were that the location have multiplexing equipment by which voice grade circuits are derived from high 
capacity facilities, that the location have access to all other high-density locations over high capacity facilities and that the 
location have local distribution facilities to extend service to a customer's premises (id.). "
1298,162," SPCC also referred the Court to PX3-0904 which purports to be a statement of ""Book Costs Per Circuit Mile -- By States"" for 
the Bell System as of December 1975.  SPCC interprets this document as also supporting its claim that high-density locations 
are more costly than low-density locations (Tr. 2236-38). This document, however, has no apparent relationship to routes or 
density of traffic.  On its face it shows that book cost per circuit mile is directly proportional to the size of the State -- a showing 
that long haul intrastate circuits are less costly than short haul intrastate circuits (Hough, Tr. 3531-33).  Thus, the District of 
Columbia (the smallest jurisdiction) has the highest cost per circuit mile ($ 307) and Rhode Island has the second highest ($ 
167).  California, the most populous state, and one of the largest, has one of the lowest costs ($ 55).  As Mr. Hough testified, 
there is no basis for reading this document as establishing anything with respect to the construction, labor, maintenance or other 
costs of providing service between high-density locations (Hough, Tr. 3531-33).  The Court agrees."
1298,163," Although plaintiffs have suggested that an inference adverse to defendants should be drawn from the fact that AT & T 
considered, but did not implement, a regional deaveraging plan, there was no obligation to engage in regional pricing, Broadway 
Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Service, Inc., supra, 651 F.2d at 131, and the Court is satisfied that there was a reasonable basis 
for not doing so (deButts, Tr. 4106; Olley, Tr. 5387-89). "
1299,164," What is noteworthy is that to the Court's knowledge, no commissioner has come out with such a charge, nor has any 
proceeding been implemented at the FCC concerning such charges.  Equally lacking is any charge of misrepresentation before 
the state commissions.  Rather, the Court is presented with a biased, interested person in the form of Mr. Hinchman. "
1308,165," The Court's conclusion in this respect is confirmed by the position of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division in the appeal 
of the FCC's Docket No. 18128 decision.  Not only did the Department in that appeal support LRIC, but it also advocated what it 
called ""inverse demand elasticity"" pricing -- the equivalent of Ramsey pricing (S-5716 at 36; Melody, Tr. 5642).  As the 
Department of Justice stated (S-5716 at 36 n.34): ""Two key facts underlie this approach, known in the trade as 'inverse demand elasticity' pricing. . . .  First, the industry has 
constantly decreasing costs so that the extra business it picks up at lower prices is in fact the least costly to provide.  
Second, the higher-priced group has low elasticity, that is, it will buy a certain amount of service no matter how the price 
varies over a wide range.  No one has challenged that both key facts are present here."""
1308,166," As one of the many points covered broadly in his rebuttal testimony, Dr. Melody testified that AT & T could not have engaged 
in Ramsey pricing, principally because it had not conducted the LRIC studies for all of its services necessary to implement this 
pricing approach (Melody, Tr. 5593-94).  This unsupported assertion, however, is directly contrary to the testimony of Mr. 
Eastmond that incremental costs, together with demand studies, were used by AT & T in evaluating rate changes for all of its 
services, MTS and WATS services as well as the then more competitive private line services (Eastmond, S-T-11 at 20). "
1309,167," To the extent that plaintiffs can be understood to complain not that the request for permission to file was made, but that it was 
publicized, the Court is likewise convinced that no violation can properly be found.  The Hi/Lo special permission application was 
a public document filed with the FCC as part of a pending proceeding before the Commission.  Once that application was filed, 
the Hi/Lo rates were public.  Publicizing the contents of public records of a pending governmental proceeding is protected by the 
First Amendment and is therefore not actionable under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 
U.S. 469, 491-97, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 95 S. Ct. 1029 (1975); see also Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Service 
Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341, 100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980)."
1309,168," Although the Court addresses plaintiffs' showing with respect to injury in fact resulting from AT & T's challenged pricing 
practices below, there is no evidence in the record from any customer that the so-called ""preannouncement"" of Hi/Lo caused 
that customer to decline to order service from plaintiffs or to delay ordering service from plaintiffs -- evidence which, as the 
Second Circuit held in Berkey Photo (603 F.2d at 289), is essential to any claim such as ""preannouncement"" involving injury 
resulting from the impact of a challenged practice upon a plaintiff's customers. "
1310,169," In addition, Mr. Brodman's conclusion is supported by -- and in fact was predicted by -- two reports prepared for SPCC by 
consulting organizations shortly after the Hi/Lo special permission application was filed, one by Transcomm, Inc. and the other 
by the Stanford Research Institute.  Both those reports accurately projected that the Hi/Lo tariff would have little, if any, 
competitive impact on SPCC (S-2609; S-2625)."
1310,170," SPCC documents recognized that even SPCC's initial full time single-channel rates undercut the high-density rates by some 
16 percent on long-haul routes such as San Francisco to Houston (S-2850 at 5). "
1312,171," The private line revenues from these customers leveled off after 1977, consistent with the testimony of SPCC witnesses 
(Furth, Tr. 390; Grant, Tr. 771, 774) that, when SPCC began marketing SPRINT in 1978, SPCC artificially limited its private line 
circuits to approximately 10,000 and put its marketing emphasis and system expansion in its SPRINT switched service, the 
revenues from which are not included in Mr. Brown's figures (see PX6-0031 at Att. 2)."
1312,172," In these circumstances, it is obvious to the Court that many of SPCC's claimed difficulties with the Telpak structure would 
also have been present if Telpak did not exist and if, instead, SPCC faced competition from private microwave systems (Hough, 
S-T-1 at 31).  For instance, the owner of a private system with excess capacity would, like a similarly situated Telpak customer, 
have access to ""free"" channels until system capacity was reached (Hough, S-T-1 at 28-30; PX2-0017 at 7-8; PX2-0225). "
1313,173," SPCC cites DiGaetano v. Texas Co., 300 F.2d 895, 897 (3d Cir. 1962), for the proposition that the entry of an injunction will 
not shield AT & T from claims about Telpak for the period prior to the injunction.  This is no doubt correct, but the Court has 
found no impact on SPCC from Telpak in this period.  The Court is aware of no case, and SPCC has offered none, that would 
hold AT & T liable for complying with the injunction entered by the Court of Appeals."
1313,174," This evidence also disposes of plaintiffs' reliance on Borden, Inc. v. FTC, 674 F.2d 498, 1982-1 Trade Cas. P 64,558 (6th Cir. 
1982). The Court has substantial doubts about whether Borden correctly states the law applicable in a Section 2 case, but in any 
event that case holds only that a firm cannot use its unique brand loyalty to drive equally efficient competitors with equivalent 
products to sell below the competitors' own average variable costs.  Id. at 674 F.2d 498. There is evidence here that SPCC was 
not as efficient as AT & T, and its product was admittedly inferior.  Yet, the clear and undisputed evidence is that SPCC was 
always selling above its own incremental cost. "
1314,175," It is undisputed that the local distribution facilities (LDF's) are essential facilities as they are essential to SPCC's ability to 
render service to its customers. The Court would point out, however, that this is spurious at best, for it is possible to duplicate the 
LDF's.  For its application before the FCC, Datran stated ""that end-to-end facilities are essential to its switched digital data "
1315,," network and that interconnection with the local telephone exchange systems is not suitable to it."" Specialized Common Carriers, 
29 F.C.C.2d 870 (1971) went on to conclude ""that new carriers should have the option of constructing their own independent 
local facilities to provide end-to-end service.  (footnote omitted) ( id. at 940). Further, the SCC's could make use of by-pass-
facilities which are: ""Alternatives to local telephone company provided distribution. Facilities such as cellular radio, two-way cable TV, short 
haul microwave and direct satellite to roof top antennas are examples of technological developments being employed by 
other common carriers (OCC's) and cable TV, companies which potentially have the capability to circumvent the use of the 
local telephone network."" (AT & T Telecommunications Glossary March, 1982 at 5.) Indeed, by a 6 to 1 vote, the FCC gave Communications Satellite Corp., permission to begin building a revolutionary system to 
broadcast television programs directly to viewers' homes via satellite, bypassing existing local television stations. Washington 
Post, at D8 (September 24, 1982)."
1315,176," Surely the Armory Board would not be required to enter into the same lease arrangement with plaintiff as it had with Hecht 
Pro-Football Inc. that was signed in 1959; only that a fair contract was entered into.  It may well be that with the passage of time 
(and inflation) 12% of the gross revenues would be inadequate and that the 1000 free tickets limitation would be inappropriate.  
However, both parties must abide by the terms of the lease. In this Court's opinion one should not be able to come in over 15 
years or after any significant passage of time after the fact and receive the exact same contract without taking into account the 
surrounding circumstances."
1315,177," In Hecht, for example, the Court of Appeals held that the Washington Redskins could be required to share RFK Stadium with 
another professional football team during times when the stadium was not being used by the Redskins.  The essential facilities 
doctrine, however, could not be construed to require the Redskins to play a game with a competing football team. "

observed (1P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 140 (1978)): ""Antitrust courts can and do consider the particular circumstances of an industry and therefore adjust their usual rules to the 
existence, extent, and nature of regulation."" One example of this adjustment is that a ""specific intent"" must be shown in order to establish a Section 2 violation where a 
regulated public utility is involved.  See City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 931-32 (2d Cir. 1981);

1318,184," Contrary to plaintiffs' position, the Court of Appeals in Phonetele did not establish a ""least restrictive alternative"" test as the 
standard under the Sherman Act. Indeed, on reconsideration, the Ninth Circuit made it clear that an anticompetitive tariff could 
be justified on a showing that it was ""a reasonable, properly focused mechanism, considering other alternatives then available"" 
(Order of March 15, 1982).  In this respect, Phonetele is fully consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals for this Circuit 
in Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 185 U.S. App. D.C. 142, 567 F.2d 9, 40 n.67 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 829, 54 L. Ed.

1319,185," The Court finds Mr. Smith's testimony of particular importance not only of how reasonable businessmen conduct business but 
also the reasonableness in all of plaintiffs' claims of AT & T.  Mr. Smith was asked the following question by SPCC (by Mr. 
Labovitz) to which he responded (Tr. 4818): Q.  Was one of the major reasons that General Electric abandoned the private microwave plan that it had trouble with AT & 
T trying to get interconnections? A.  Certainly not.  We were carrying on -- our operating people were carrying on extensive negotiations with AT & T, and as 
in any negotiations like that you have many gives and takes and up the hill, down the hill, around the hill.  If at any point we 
thought that we were not getting a fair shake out of AT & T or that we had policy questions, we would have gone to John 
deButts or other top executives of AT & T.  That is the way business is done, and I would have had no hesitancy in doing 
that. The Court also notes that Mr. Smith's testimony carries substantial weight as he was negotiating on behalf of one of the top 
three telecommunications users in the country. "
1320,186," The parties seem to agree that the distinction between leasing of intercity facilities and the piecing-out of an intercity service 
is more than semantics.  As the Court understands it, the leasing concept preserves the ability of the carrier providing the 
service to provide that service on an end-to-end basis.  In other words, the customer is provided the entire service by a single 
carrier, even though that carrier utilizes not only its own transmission facilities but also leased transmission facilities in the 
provision of that service, and the customer pays the tariff rate of the serving carrier only (Vasilakos, PX6-0006 at 10).  On the 
other hand, the ""piece-out"" concept involves two carriers each providing a portion of single end-to-end service with neither 
carrier having responsibility for the entire service.  In this situation the customer pays the tariff rate of each carrier (id. at 11)."
1320,187," As noted above, the Court does not believe the antitrust laws required AT & T to assist SPCC by sharing non-essential 
facilities SPCC could have provided for itself.  The Court must also reject plaintiffs' alternative legal theory that defendants' 
piece-out tariff involved an unlawful tie-in under the antitrust laws. HN59[
] A tying arrangement can arise only where the 
""tying"" and ""tied"" items are in fact two separate products or services.  Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S.

By its terms, the tariff restriction on piece-outs did not apply where the customer had a genuine desire for private line service 
along two separate routes; it applied only where the customer attempted to divide a single through service over one route (Tr. 
48-49).  Consequently, the Court finds that defendants' piece-out tariff cannot be properly characterized as a tying arrangement. "
1322,188," The absurdity of the but-for damage model is demonstrated by the fact that the $ 300,000 in revenues that Dr. Berner 
concludes that SPCC could have obtained in the but-for world became $ 2.8 million in damages after being run through the 
damage model (PX5-0364).  Neither Dr. Berner nor any other SPCC witness was able to explain this patently absurd result 
(Berner, Tr. 5886-86; Lim, Tr. 5905-07)."
1322,189," Ironically, not only does the record show that SPCC generally had more business than it could handle, it shows that as early 
as August 1974, SPCC had ""sold out"" its capacity between Phoenix and San Antonio (S-3152) so that it could not have obtained 
any additional revenues from leasing or piece-out in the very Los Angeles-Houston-New Orleans example used by Mr. Vasilakos 
to illustrate how SPCC could allegedly profit from leasing or piece-out. "
1323,190," SPCC argues that AT & T's piece-out policy was designed solely to impede competition, and was not premised on technical 
or economic considerations.  In support of this proposition, plaintiffs introduced documents authored by AT & T personnel.  The 
Court is not convinced that the evidence adduced by plaintiffs supports SPCC's allegations -- in fact some of plaintiffs' exhibits 
clearly support the conclusion that AT & T's piece-out policy was premised on legitimate technical and economic considerations.  
(See e.g., PX4-0076; PX4-0085.) Indeed, a memo from W. E. Albert to Mr. K. D. Howatt on 7-10-72 expressed the valid 
concerns of AT & T wherein he pointed out (PX 4-0085 at LA1D0161-3): ""We have reviewed the totality of problems in attempting to comply with G.E.'s request for joint carrier-customer provision of 
a complex, integrated private communications network. From this we conclude that it is not possible to jointly furnish such a 
network in a manner that will provide proper service without diseconomies and subsidization of GE by the Telephone 
Company's other customers. These would arise from many intangible areas of joint planning, sharing our know-how, and 
changing design, maintenance and administrative disciplines to more expensive operations.  Extending interconnection of 
the type requested by GE to other customers, each with different requirements would produce a vast intermingling of 
ownership and control of elements in the CCSA network, and its connection to the public telecommunications network that 
would be impossible to administer and maintain so as to provide GE and other similar users acceptable service.  Further, 
the provision of such a complex, interconnected system was not envisioned in the tariff changes made with respect to the 
interconnection of customer provided terminal equipment and communications systems. After evaluation of the complexities that developed during the protracted negotiations with GE, it is the Bell System's 
conclusion that joint carrier-customer provision of CCSA networks should not be undertaken. The joint provision of such a network by a common carrier and co-supplier, such as GE, would create an environment of 
direct competition between the two suppliers.  GE would be motivated to suboptimize its portion of the integrated private 
line network. The stated objective of GE to minimize its costs would cause GE to take advantage of the carrier's tariff-cost 
relationship.  The net result would be detrimental to each, and the general public.  The carriers motivation and responsibility 
always is to optimize the total network to achieve minimum cost of the total facilities and equipment in order to best serve 
the entire public."" (Emphasis supplied). "
1326,191," FX (foreign exchange) is a telephone exchange service furnished to a customer through a central office of an exchange other 
than the exchange in which the customer is located.  (AT & T Telecommunications Glossary March, 1982 at 30).  This service 
gives a telephone user in one locality the equivalent of a local telephone in a second distant city.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 5-6; and 
Attachment 2, Grant, Tr. 637).  This is accomplished by extending a private line dedicated solely to the user from its premises in 
City A, called the closed end, to the telephone company local office in the distant City B, called the open end.  (Grant, PX6-0004 
at 5-6 and Attachment 2; Grant, Tr. 637).  When the customer picks up his telephone receiver in City A, the dial tone he receives 
comes from the City B local telephone office.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 5-6 and Attachment 2; Grant Tr. 637).  The customer can 
then dial as a local call any number in the City B local telephone company area.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 5-6 and Attachment 2; 
Grant, Tr. 637).  Conversely, any person in City B can reach the customer in City A by dialing a local number in City B.  (Grant, 
PX6-0004 at 5-6 and Attachment 2; Grant, Tr. 637)."
1326,192," CCSA (common control switching arrangements) is a service provided by established telephone common carriers which 
furnishes an intercity private line switching network for a customer; CCSA service is provided for the exclusive use of the 
customer, or a customer and the customer's authorized users.  However, the switches used to provide CCSA service may be 
used to serve more than one customer. (AT & T Telecommunications Glossary, March, 1982 at 10).  This service gives a large 
company the equivalent of a complete private or dedicated telephone system.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 6-8 and Attachment 3; 
Grant, Tr. 637).  In a CCSA configuration, a customer leases several switches or portions of switches throughout the country 
from the partnership of AT & T Long Lines, the BOC's and the independents.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 6-8 and Attachment 3; Grant, 
Tr. 637).  These switches are connected to long-haul lines known as intermachine trunks (Grant, PX6-0004 at 608 and 
Attachment 3; Grant, Tr. 637). Both the intermachine trunks and the access lines are dedicated, private lines.  (Grant, PX6-0004 
at 6-8 and Attachment 3; Grant, Tr. 637).  Specialized common carriers such as SPCC provide both intermachine trunks and 
access lines, but cannot provide either FX or CCSA service without obtaining local distribution facilities from the BOC's and the 
independents or through the use of by-pass equipment.  (Grant, PX6-0004 at 6-7 and Attachment 3; Grant, Tr. 637). "

1327,195," The Court is of the opinion that the question of whether the Specialized Common Carriers decision did or did not authorize 
the new carriers to provide FX and CCSA is a question of law.  This does not mean, however, that if, contrary to this Court's 
conclusion, the decisions referred to above do resolve the question as a matter of law, that AT & T's conduct violated the 
antitrust laws. As the Court discusses below, even if the Specialized Common Carriers decision did authorize the new carriers to 
provide FX and CCSA services, AT & T's conduct was reasonable under the circumstances and thus fully meets the Rule of 
Reason standard."
1327,196," See Partoll, S-T-149 at 4-17."
1327,197," The Supreme Court has applied the non-retroactivity principle in a variety of situations.  See, e.g., Allen v. State Board of 
Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 572, 22 L. Ed. 2d 1, 89 S. Ct. 817 (1969); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U.S. 701, 23 L. Ed. 2d 647, 
89 S. Ct. 1897 (1969). Thus, in Cipriano, the Supreme Court applied the principle that ""where a decision of an appellate court 
could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively then 'injustice and hardship' should be avoided by a holding 
of non-retroactivity"" (395 U.S. at 706). Similarly, in Bendix Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 471 F.2d 149, 155-58 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. 
denied, 414 U.S. 819, 38 L. Ed. 2d 51, 94 S. Ct. 43 (1973), the Seventh Circuit applied the principle to prevent the recovery of "
1328,," antitrust damages during a period prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 23 L. Ed. 2d 610, 
89 S. Ct. 1902 (1969), because the claim involved depended upon the Lear decision to overrule a prior precedent that would 
have barred recovery."
1328,198," The Commission's proceeding in Docket No. 19896 was not an evidentiary proceeding.  In light of this fact and for reasons 
discussed elsewhere, the Court has given very little weight to this decision.  The Third Circuit's subsequent affirmance has no 
independent evidentiary significance particularly given the limited scope of that Court's review."
1328,199," Whether FX and CCSA are ""private line"" services is not truly relevant because, as the Court discusses below, the key 
question is what services were proposed.  However, the Court is satisfied that FX is not a true private line service and cannot be 
obtained under AT & T's interstate private line tariff (Byers, S-T-133 at 27).  FX is a ""hybrid"" service requiring a ""foreign 
exchange channel,"" i.e., an intercity dedicated channel serving the same purpose as an extension cord, which is provided under 
AT & T's interstate private line tariff and which is then connected to local exchange service provided under the local tariffs of the 
local operating company to form FX service (Byers S-T-133 at 27; Byers S-T-133, U.S. Tr. at 20214; PX4-0735)."
1328,200," In its 1976 Execunet decision ( In re MCI Telecommunications Corp., 603 F.C.C.2d 25, 43 (1976)) the FCC defined these 
terms as follows: ""Point-to-point private line service is a term which denotes a dedicated or private local channel at each end, connecting the 
customer's premises to the carrier's local central office, and an interexchange channel (IXC) which connects the central "
1329,," offices.  At the customer's premises, the local channel is connected with a telephone, private branch exchange (PBX), 
teletypewriter or other terminal equipment.  The local channel at each end is dedicated solely to the private line service."" ""Foreign Exchange (FX) service includes a dedicated local channel, as with point-to-point private line, at one end of the 
service (commonly referred to as the closed end), connected at the carrier's central office with an IXC which terminates in a 
central office in a distant local exchange (the open end).  The customer at the closed end has non-toll access into the local 
exchange served by that distant central office.  A telephone number of the distant local exchange is assigned to the FX 
service so that the FX customer may be accessed in the same manner as if he were situated within that local exchange."" ""Common Control Switching Arrangement (CCSA) service consists of a network of private lines, subscribed to by the 
customer, which are accessed through switches, located at the carrier's central office, via dedicated local lines.  These lines 
terminate on the customer's premises in connections similar to those provided in connection with point-to-point private line 
service."" "
1330,201," ""103.  In light of all the foregoing and the record as a whole, we . . . find that: there is a public need and demand for the 
proposed facilities and services . . ."" (29 F.C.C.2d at 920)."
1330,202," The only applicant proposing any ""switched"" service was Datran and that company made it very clear to the FCC that it did 
not want to interconnect with the Bell System at all, not even for the purpose of obtaining local distribution facilities (Ashley, S-T-
132, App. A at 12-14). "
1333,203," According to defendants, the October 3, 1973 meeting was a key event in the evolution of a plan or scheme developed by Mr. 
Strassburg and MCI -- with SPCC's knowledge -- designed to secure FX/CCSA rights for the specialized carriers without ever 
having the FCC address the issue (Byers, S-T-133 at 41-49 & App. A; Interconnection -- FX/CCSA Doc. Sub. at 2-6).  Although 
not dispositive of the issue, as discussed below, the Court finds substantial support that such a plan did, in fact, exist."
1333,204," Mr. Kelley Griffith of the FCC staff also testified in his deposition that during this time period ""MCI people felt that the 
Commission's decisions [regarding FX/CCSA services] were ambiguous or hazy . . ."" (S-5479 at 104)."
1333,205," The Third Circuit vacated a preliminary injunction requiring AT & T to provide FX and CCSA interconnections to MCI.  
According to defendants, MCI sought and obtained the preliminary injunction as part of the scheme developed by Mr. Strassburg 
discussed earlier.  Once again, the Court finds substantial support for this view of the events of that period."
1333,206," Dean Rostow also testified that the Task Force recommendations did not include or contemplate FX and CCSA or ""anything 
of the sort"" (Rostow, Tr. 3651-52). "
1334,207," The April 1974 decision in Docket No. 19896, however, makes no mention of this ""vague . . . ambiguity."" Instead, while 
acknowledging that the Commission's prior decision ""may not have been perfectly clear"" (46 F.C.C.2d at 436), the opinion is 
quite critical of the Bell System.  In the Court's view, the language used in the April 1974 decision is intellectually dishonest.  The 
Court has had ample opportunity to observe Mr. Hinchman -- he testified in this case on three separate occasions -- and it is an 
understatement to say, as the Court found above, that he lacks credibility.  For this reason and others discussed elsewhere, the 
Court gives no weight to the April 1974 decision with respect to the question of what AT & T knew or should have known prior to 
that date."
1334,208," Throughout 1972, based on its understanding of the Specialized Common Carriers decision, AT & T had refused to provide 
FX or CCSA interconnections to MCI for MCI's Chicago to St. Louis route. Yet, as pointed out above, in the 1972 brief on appeal 
of that decision, the FCC specifically referred to MCI being ""successfully"" interconnected with defendants (S-2427 at 43, n.16).  
Mr. Pettit, who was General Counsel for the FCC at the time the brief was written, testified that the Common Carrier Bureau ""had 
participated in the preparation and review of the brief"" (S-T-134).  The Court shares the view of Mr. Pettit that if the FCC had 
intended the Specialized Common Carriers decision to include FX and CCSA, it certainly would not have made contrary 
representations to the Court of Appeals (Pettit, S-T-134 at 4-5).  The fact that the FCC in April 1974 asked its General Counsel 
to send its decision in Docket No. 19896 to the Court of Appeals ""to dispel any ambiguities the brief may have created"" merely 
confirms the conclusion that the FCC revised its view on FX and CCSA in 1974 (46 F.C.C.2d 413, 425 n.14 (1974) (S-2988)). "
1335,209," The Court has examined carefully a number of AT & T documents put into evidence here by SPCC which SPCC asserts 
show that AT & T knew that its conduct was inconsistent with the FCC's orders.  The court finds, to the contrary, that none of 
these documents support that proposition directly or indirectly.  What they do show is a general concern by Bell System 
employees at various levels about the potentially adverse economic, technical and operational consequences of FCC policy "
1336,," trends and possible future FCC directives.  Typical perhaps is PX4-0436, a memorandum to Mr. Charles Brown, then President 
of Illinois Bell and currently Chairman of the Board of AT & T.  While the document does show, as SPCC asserts, that AT & T 
realized that the size of the market for FX and CCSA services was substantial, it also shows, as SPCC does not point out, that 
the author was advising Mr. Brown that Illinois Bell had refused FX and CCSA connections to MCI because it ""was an attempt by 
MCI to supply a service they were not authorized to provide"" (id. at 3).  No reason occurs to the Court nor has any been 
suggested by SPCC why an Illinois Bell employee would mislead Mr. Brown about MCI's authorization or lack thereof to provide 
FX or CCSA service. "
1337,210," Despite SPCC's initial indications that Mr. Brodman would speak to these issues, Mr. Brodman's testimony did not 
encompass the intrastate FX question.  AT & T, however, submitted the written testimony of Messrs. Allen (S-T-137), Freeman 
(S-T-138), Privett (S-T-143) and Symons (S-T-142), all of whom were personally involved in this issue.  As plaintiffs chose not to 
cross-examine any of these witnesses and none appeared as witnesses in the Government or MCI cases, there can be no doubt 
about their credibility.  On the other hand, the Court has serious doubts about both the knowledge and the credibility of Mr. 
Vasilakos.  At one point, Mr. Vasilakos' testimony in connection with these issues was controverted by Mr. Grant (Compare 
Grant, Tr. 749-50 with Vasilakos, Tr. 898-99)."
1337,211," Indeed, SPCC knew as early as June 22, 1973 that ""if SPCC were to file a tariff specifying points of communication only 
within the state of California, it would be rejected . . ."" (Letter of SPCC's counsel, Mr. Forrest to Mr. Thurmond A. Miller (S-2661 
at 1) It is obvious to the Court that this letter would also have applied to intrastate FX and CCSA, though at the time it is 
debatable whether SPCC even contemplated such service."
1337,212," It is interesting to note how SPCC attempted to circumvent the various state commissions by devising ""schemes"" to make 
intrastate lines interstate. In a June 26, 1973 letter to Mr. Forrest, Mr. Albertson stated, ""hopefully, this makes them appear as 
interstate, although, I wonder if the FCC will add up all the channels going to Los Angeles, etc., as they did when we routed our 
Houston circuits into Los Angeles."" (S-2683 at AE 1194).  SPCC went even further with the use of a rusty-switch approach to 
legalize an intrastate circuit (S-0147) and informed its salesmen to ""never put in writing any reference to or suggestions that a 
customer (uses) a rusty switch to gain interstate service."" (S-2833).  See also, S-3521 (Comments of G. Hurley on the recent 
proposal to standardize on a rusty-switch for the purpose of legalizing interstate sales).  A rusty-switch is a concept whereby one 
customer that has a need for an intrastate network is connected to one out-of-state line on which he has no real service 
requirements.  The use of a rusty-switch was to avoid state public utility commission jurisdiction.  (S-6078) Furthermore, with respect to the interstate/intrastate controversy, Mr. Darling of the FCC stated (S-T-148A, at 2), that ""if one 
company provided the service then intrastate was contaminated."" Thus the intrastate line was classified as interstate. If, 
however, two companies provided the line, then there was no contamination.  (id.) Moreover, Mr. Darling testified that he 
informed Mr. Forrest about the situation.  (id. at 3). "
1338,213," Although Southwestern Bell apparently declined initially to provide such interconnections, the evidence shows that only a few 
weeks later Southwestern Bell met with SPCC representatives and voluntarily offered to provide the requested interconnections. 
(Agreed Fact 4-2-17; S-3138; See also Agreed Fact 4-2-10; S-3133 and S-3139).  Southwestern Bell, however, pointed out that 
the offer could not be taken as a commitment to provide similar facilities in States which had state regulatory bodies (S-3138).  
SPCC refused this offer and sought to press the issue in Texas in the hope of obtaining a favorable ruling from the FCC 
applicable to other States (S-3138).  Several months later, after the FCC took the position that the controversy was moot in light 
of Southwestern Bell's offer, SPCC accepted the offer (S-3231; S-3176; Agreed Fact 4-2-1).  Consequently, it is clear to the 
Court that any injury which resulted from the Texas intrastate FX controversy was attributable primarily if not solely to SPCC's 
decision to delay accepting Southwestern Bell's offer."
1338,214," In California and in Oklahoma, the state regulatory bodies were primarily concerned about creamskimming and the resultant 
harm on their general ratepayers of new entry by specialized carriers. (Privett, S-T-143 at 4-5; Symons, S-T-142 at 4-5)."
1338,215," The Court recognizes that on October 9, 1975, the FCC concluded that ""the Bell System Companies must continue to provide 
the interconnections and facilities to SPCC to interconnect with the facilities . . . located within the state of California and 
Oklahoma, pursuant to the applicable interstate tariffs."" ( PX4-0681, 56 F.C.C.2d at 21). This was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit on 
June 30, 1977, in California v. F.C.C., 185 U.S. App. D.C. 217, 567 F.2d 84 (D.C. Cir. 1977) cert. denied 434 U.S. 1010, 54 L. 
Ed. 2d 753, 98 S. Ct. 721, 98 S. Ct. 722 (1978). However, what is important is that nothing contradicts the notion that the 
actions of the defendants were reasonable.  Indeed, Circuit Judge Robinson, in his dissent in California states his disagreement 
with the Commission actions, not substantively but procedurally. . . . The Commission did not, however, undertake to explain why such a difficulty would arise, nor how close that difficulty is 
to impossibility (FX interconnections).  This unfortunate lack of specificity, is understandable, since the record is devoid of 
any evidentiary basis for the Commission's assertions, and it, is hardly common knowledge.  It is to be noted, moreover, 
that the Commission refused to convene a proceeding in which this factual question could be fleshed out.  Since the 
Commission's findings come up substantively short and even so is unsupported by the evidence, I cannot accept the 
conclusions that flow from it.  (footnote omitted) (id. at 90). "
1339,216," This ruling subsequently was reversed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, but at no time did Southwestern Bell refuse to 
provide the interconnections sought (Privett, S-T-143 at 5; Allen, S-T-137 at 6-8, 14; Agreed Fact 4-2-3)."
1339,217," Indeed, despite the fact that SWB agreed to provide the connections on August 16, 1974, it took almost a month for SPCC to 
respond.  (Agreed Fact 4-2-001) This does not establish to the Court's satisfaction a company desperately wanting or needing to 
provide FX service."
1339,218," While the plaintiffs dispute this, the fact is that they have not shown where they have made any such complaint, except 
among themselves. "
1340,219," Paragraph 9(c) of the Application filed with the California Public Utilities Commission provides: ""This agreement shall be an interim agreement and shall be effective until superseded pursuant to the provisions of Section 
8d above or for a period of one year from the date of its effectiveness, whichever is earlier."""
1340,220," It is the Court's view that SPCC's acceptance of the terms and conditions contained in the 1973 draft facility contract is 
underscored by SPCC's separate negotiations with the independent telephone companies for the provision of local distribution 
facilities.  For example, upon review of a contract proposed in 1973 by the largest independent, General Telephone Company, 
Mr. Albertson of SPCC stated ""my suggestion is to simply reword it along the lines of the present AT & T Local Loop Agreement"" 
(S-2725).  Similarly, on July 9, 1975, Mr. Kopf remarked to Mr. Geier of SPCC, regarding the provision of local loops by the 
independent telephone companies, that ""the terms and conditions of these contracts appear to be more onerous than those 
maintained in the Bell Company tariffs"" (S-3683).  As discussed below, defendants filed tariffs in the fall of 1973 that were 
patterned after the provisions of the draft facilities contract negotiated by SPCC and AT & T.  Those tariffs contained terms that 
SPCC admits were, if anything, more favorable to SPCC than had been the terms of the draft contract (Grant, Tr. 674-75; Cook, 
S-T-57 at 29). "
1341,221," In fact, since the mid-1930s AT & T private line tariffs on file with the FCC have provided that "". . . where a shortage of 
channels or equipment exists at any time either for temporary or protracted periods, the establishment of Long Distance 
Message Telecommunications Service shall take precedence over all other services"" (S-5863C).  Moreover, the Court 
understands this was the practice in the industry in general, as is evident from the fact that independent telephone companies, 
such as General Telephone, had similar provisions in their contracts with SPCC (S-5608D). "
1342,222," The Court finds equally without merit SPCC's charge that an early AT & T proposal to provide local distribution facilities to the 
other carriers under the so-called ""capital contribution"" concept somehow evidences AT & T's bad faith.  The proposal, which 
was never implemented and which was in fact withdrawn early in the parties' contract negotiations, called for the specialized 
carrier to make an up-front payment for a facility that would be dedicated to that carrier's use, with a monthly service charge to 
be paid at a rate lower than would be the case under a lease agreement.  The Court finds that the proposal merely represented 
a reasonable method for AT & T to recoup its capital costs of constructing the required facilities for the specialized carriers and 
that it was not designed to divert capital away from the carrier's network construction program (PX4-0020; Cook, S-T-57 at 8).  
The Court further concludes, based on the evidence presented, that far from being discriminatory, there were substantial 
economic advantages to be gained by SPCC under the ""capital contribution"" approach as evidenced by the widespread 
acceptance of a similar plan by other carriers who desired an alternative to leasing as a means of utilizing AT & T's ocean cable 
facilities (Cook, S-T-57 at 7-8)."
1342,223," Following the FCC's decision in Docket No. 19896, defendants filed revised facility tariffs in May 1974 which contained 
substantially the same terms as had the preceding tariffs, except that they also provided for interconnections to enable SPCC 
and the other specialized carriers to offer FX and CCSA services and for the leasing of defendants' interconnection facilities 
between a specialized carrier's technical operating centers (S-3000B; S-3000D; S-3002)."
1342,224," In its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated September 26, 1974, the Commission held (which was signed by Walter 
Hinchman) (S-3199B): ""2.  We believe that to the extent that it is possible to resolve the issues herein outside the context of formal procedures it 
would be in the public interest to do so where such informal procedures will lead to an accelerated resolution of the issues."" Moreover, it is important to note that the Commission did not end its proceedings, but rather postponed them for six weeks to 
see if the parties were able to reach accord informally (S-3199B at para. 3). "
1343,225," The use of the informal conferences was concurred in by SPCC on October 17, 1974 wherein it wrote (S-3206 at 2): ""SP Communications also agrees with the Bell System that the questions for resolution distributed at the informal 
conference merit early attention, and welcome the offer of the Bell System to work informally with the Commission and the 
interested parties in resolving as many issues as possible expeditiously and without protracted formal proceedings."""
1343,226," This negates SPCC's claim that AT & T's proposal was an ultimatum which SPCC had to accept.  For if SPCC were 
dissatisfied, they could have brought their concerns before the Commission, who unquestionably had the power to resolve the 
issue, one way or another."
1343,227," In its March 13, 1975, joint motions to the Commission seeking approval of the Settlement Agreement of FCC Docket No. 
20099 signed by all the parties, it was stated (S-3469 at 3):"
1343,2," .  ""As a result of these informal settlement discussions, conducted under the aegis of the Commission with the direct 
participation of representatives of the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, the undersigned parties have reached agreement on a 
settlement which is set forth in the Settlement Agreement attached hereto and incorporated as a part hereof."
1343,3," .  The undersigned parties believe that the settlement, as reflected in the attached Settlement Agreement, will serve the public 
interests of the parties, because it affords for an interim period an expeditious and acceptable compromise of differences on 
matters which would otherwise necessitate substantial time, expense and effort to resolve through formal Commission 
processes."
1343,4," .  The separated Trial Staff of the Common Carrier Bureau, a party to this proceeding, believes that the terms of the Settlement 
Agreement represents an acceptable compromise of the respective parties having individual interests in the outcome of the 
proceeding. Because the Settlement Agreement is generally limited in duration to an interim period, the separated Trial Staff 
believes that the public interest would best be served by the Commission action requested of the parties."" (Emphasis supplied)."
1343,228," In its April 23, 1975, Memorandum Opinion and Order the F.C.C. stated (S-3556; 52 F.C.C.2d at 732): ""We believe that the terms of the Settlement, including the responsibilities undertaken by the parties, are in the public 
interest because they expedite and further the implementation of established Commission policy.  Furthermore, as noted by 
the parties, the settlement affords an expeditious and acceptable compromise of differences on matters which would 
otherwise necessitate substantial time, expense and effort to resolve through formal Commission processes.  Therefore, we 
will accept the settlement (without necessarily approving it) as a disposition, without prejudice, of Docket No. 20099."" Recognizing that problems may still exist, the Commission left the door open for any party to air their complaints wherein it 
stated (id.) at 733: ""We will expect all parties to the Settlement Agreement not only to comply with its terms, but also to adhere to its spirit.  We 
expect to closely monitor the implementation of the Settlement Agreement, and to this end we endorse the proposal to 
conduct, as necessary, meetings of the parties under the aegis of the Commission's Common Carrier Bureau to review the 
progress made in implementing the Settlement Agreement.  It is our hope that, through these meetings, the parties will be 
able to informally resolve any differences which may arise.  However, we wish to make clear that no one is, precluded from 
bringing to the Commission's attention any matter which it believes requires Commission action."" (Emphasis supplied). To the Court's knowledge, SPCC did not do this. "
1344,229," Although plaintiffs offered Mr. Sternberg's deposition testimony, the Court finds that Mr. Sternberg did not lend any credible 
support to SPCC's claim that it entered into the Settlement Agreement in Docket No. 20099 under duress. By contrast, in a letter 
to Mr. Miller, SPCC's General Counsel, describing the negotiations, Mr. Sternberg informed Mr. Miller that general agreement 
had been reached on the majority of the unresolved issues (Sternberg, Ex. 9 at 1; Dep. Tr. at 88-90). "
1345,230," This does not mean that SPCC received everything that they wanted, but as the Court sees it, unless they (SPCC) did 
receive everything that they wanted, then they would still be in Court claiming a violation of the antitrust laws. What is very 
interesting to the Court is that SPCC to this date has not raised these problems with the Commission where they could have 
been resolved expeditiously. "
1346,231," The Court agrees with this position.  If defendants had provided facilities to SPCC at the Western Union contract rates, it 
would have meant subsidizing SPCC in the amount of approximately $ 13 million through March 1978 (Cashman, S-T-31, 
Attachment 2).  Since other carriers would have had to be favored with identical subsidies, the loss to the Bell operating 
companies, which ultimately would have been borne by other customers, would have been much greater."
1346,232," The Western Union Contract No. 1 provides (PX4-0614 at 11(b)): ""This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 
five years' written notice to the other party."""
1346,233," As to Western Union, the Commission ultimately held in Docket 19896 that the tariffs did not supercede the contracts and Bell 
had to continue to provide facilities to Western Union pursuant to contracts No. 1 and No. 2 until the fall of 1978 when the five 
year notice of termination given in September, 1973 ran out.  (Agreed Fact 5-2-067). "
1347,234," It is clear to the Court that the local distribution facilities provided Western Union pursuant to the 1970 Contract was based on 
1966 costs.  (Jackson, S-T-158 at 21).  The Court is satisfied with the defendants' explanation of why Western Union LDF's were 
based on 1966 costs.  That is, the rates actually went into effect in September 1968, and were not finally memorialized in a 
contract until January 1, 1970.  (Jackson, S-T-158 at 24)."
1347,235," Collins Radio Company recognized the precarious position that AT & T occupied in a January 15, 1974 memorandum to the 
file, wherein Mr. Erickson noted (S-2892 at 3, 4): ""Bell does find itself in a dilemma on the rate issues, however because of the 'contract' versus tariff approach that it has 
followed with Western Union. The fundamental distinction between a tariff and a contract is that a tariff is subject to change at any time upon a showing 
that it is not reasonable or that it will yield non-compensatory revenues.  A contract on the other hand, is fully valid for a 
specific term irrespective of the compensatory nature of its rates or the reasonableness of its terms.  A common carrier 
such as AT & T normally must conduct all businesses through tariffs. The reason for this is that all of its operations must be 
conducted theoretically at least, in a manner such that all segments of the public derive approximately equal benefits from 
the carrier's services.  In dealing with other carriers, however, AT & T has sometimes entered into contracts rather than 
filing tariffs. This has been understandable, particularly in dealing with Western Union who has been until recently only a 
""record carrier"" conducting a business in which Bell had no great interest.  Now that Western Union has become a 
Specialized Common Carrier, as have many others, competing directly with AT & T for voice as well as record private line 
business, a situation has arisen that was not contemplated when the contract was entered.  The contract, if it is valid, still 
has four years to run.  Where the matter really begins to bind is that the FCC says that Bell must continue furnishing WU 
interconnection services on the basis of the contract.  The Philadelphia court, at the same time, says that there can be no 
discrimination in rates between WU and other SCC's.  Whipsaw."" (Emphasis supplied). "
1348,236," For example the Illinois Commerce Commission exercised jurisdiction over both the 1971 Illinois Bell-MCI contracts and the 
1973 Illinois Bell-MCI contracts, in each case finding that the terms and conditions were reasonable and that it had jurisdiction 
(Marshall, C. Tr. at 4311-14; S-2262D; S-2721D; S-2721E). "
1349,237," The Telerent proceeding was instituted by the FCC on September 7, 1973, ""in order to remove or alleviate the confusion and 
uncertainty"" that then existed over whether the FCC or state regulatory agencies had jurisdiction over the terms and conditions 
of interconnection to the nationwide switched network (45 F.C.C.2d at 213-14, 219-20). In its declaratory ruling, which was not 
released until February 5, 1974, the FCC preempted the exercise of jurisdiction by the States over those matters in the future.  
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, while affirming the Commission's decision, split 2 to 1 on the question 
whether the FCC had the power to preempt state jurisdiction in this manner.  North Carolina Utils. Comm'n v. FCC, 537 F.2d 787 
(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1027, 97 S. Ct. 651, 50 L. Ed. 2d 631, 97 S. Ct. 652 (1976). Moreover, neither the FCC nor the 
Fourth Circuit even suggested that anyone had acted improperly by resorting to state regulatory agencies prior to the FCC's 
issuance of its declaratory ruling governing the future regulation of the industry."
1349,238," In addition, the Court finds that the filing of tariffs with state regulatory agencies constituted petitioning activity protected from 
attack under the Sherman Act by virtue of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine discussed above.  As the Court has shown above, 
there was a very strenuous fight going on during this time period as to who had jurisdiction, the FCC or the states, with AT & T 
caught right in the middle.  Even to this day, the state commissions express concern about the erosion over their powers to 
regulate intrastate service (See, e.g. S-6193 at 13; S-6197 at 13)."
1349,239," In its April 30, 1973, redraft of the proposed agreement between SPCC and the telephone company, SPCC, by Mr. J. M. 
Albertson, made no revisions to the schedule of charges attached as Appendix C.  (PX4-0757 at 37-39). "
1350,240," SPCC offered no credible evidence that the rates that it paid for local facilities were unreasonable.  In an attempt to undercut 
Ms. Cashman's testimony and her studies, Dr. Melody testified during SPCC's rebuttal case that Ms. Cashman had used current 
costs instead of historical or incremental costs, which Dr. Melody asserted would have been lower.  Aside from the fact that Dr. 
Melody had no basis for his assertion other than his unsupported opinion, he did not testify that Ms. Cashman should have used 
something other than current costs or that if she had her ultimate conclusion that the rates were below costs would have been "
1351,," different.  Moreover, Mr. Field testified that under studies conducted using FDC-7 Methodology, which is based on historical 
costs, the rates charged specialized carriers for local distribution facilities in 1977 would have had to be increased 90 percent 
merely to cover costs and earn the authorized rate of return (Field, S-T-32 at 5-6)."
1351,241," During the informal negotiations held in Docket No. 20099, AT & T offered to remove from the Bell System's internal division 
of revenues process the provision of local distribution facilities to Long Lines and thereupon to offer those facilities to the 
specialized common carriers, Western Union and Long Lines at identical rates and on the same terms and conditions (S-3233B; 
Kelley, S-T-59 at 30-33; Weinstein, S-T-201 at 16).  Mr. Weinstein, the FCC's representative at the negotiations, agreed with AT 
& T that its proposal would resolve any alleged claim of discrimination between the rates, terms and conditions applicable to the 
other carriers and to Long Lines (S-T-201 at 16).  Nonetheless, the other carriers, including SPCC, rejected AT & T's proposal 
and instead insisted upon the substantial tariff rate discounts that have now been in effect for seven years (Kelley, S-T-59 at 30-
33; Weinstein, S-T-201 at 15-16). "
1352,242," Still another fact indicating the reasonableness of defendants' local distribution facility charges is that those charges were 
substantially less than what SPCC has agreed to pay to independent telephone companies.  According to SPCC, the 
independent telephone companies charged approximately $ 58 for each local loop compared to approximately $ 35 charged by 
defendants (Lim, Tr. 5937-39). "
1353,243," The Court has already dealt with SPCC's claims regarding intercity facility leasing and, to the extent the LDA claims are the 
same, the Court's earlier findings apply.  The Court, however, assumes -- although it is not entirely clear -- that SPCC's claim 
here is that the LDAs were unreasonably small.  In addition, as also noted above, after May, 1974 SPCC could have served any 
customer located anywhere -- including Ventura, California -- by leasing intercity facilities from AT & T."
1353,244," For example, the Chicago area LDA provided to MCI in 1971 included the entire Chicago Inner-Metropolitan Rate Area -- an 
area covering over 1,000 square miles -- even though the Chicago exchange covers only the city limits of Chicago (Marshall, C., 
Tr. 4310; S-93; Jackson, S-T-58 at n. 7)."
1353,245," The Court's finding is not altered by the evidence, offered by SPCC, that various Pacific Telephone proposals to define LDAs 
were forwarded to that company's marketing department, among others, for comments (PX4-0810; PX4-0811).  The Court finds 
such a practice of interdepartmental review of company proposals to be a normal and reasonable business procedure.  
Furthermore, the Court is persuaded that an operating company should be expected to review its plans for designation of local 
distribution areas, which represent the business community surrounding a city, with its marketing department.  As Mr. Snyder 
testified rhetorically: ""who is better qualified than your marketing department to determine what the business community consists 
of"" (Snyder, Tr. 4588).  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the review of proposals for local distribution areas by Pacific 
Telephone's marketing department does not evidence any anticompetitive intent or practice on the part of defendants. "
1356,246," The Court also found it significant that the draft facilities contract that SPCC and AT & T negotiated in 1973 recognized that 
SPCC would provide the functions performed by the station package (PX4-0758) and that the minor modifications proposed by 
SPCC did not address the station package requirement (Kopf, Tr. 498-99; PX4-0209). "
1359,247," Contrary to SPCC's assertions, the Bell operating companies do not simply sell interconnection facilities or local distribution 
facilities to Long Lines.  Rather, they furnish cables, buildings, microwave stations, switching machines, and other facilities 
required by the partnership for the joint provision of service (Kelley, S-T-59 at 21, 24, 26; PX4-0295)."
1359,248," Even before Docket No. 20099, MCI, the first specialized carrier and the model for SPCC and the industry, made it clear that 
the specialized carriers did not wish to be part of the Bell System interstate enterprise.  Thus, MCI stated in 1973 that 
interconnection with the Bell operating companies would not involve ""the provision of joint service, the division of charges 
therefor, or participation in any other joint or intra-corporate business relations between Long Lines and the telephone operating 
company subsidiaries of AT & T"" (S-2824B at 3; Jackson, S-T-58A at 4). "
1361,249," Mr. Spencer is the principal Illinois Bell Telephone company employee responsible on a daily basis for the provision of 
services and facilities to the OCC's (S-T-81 at 3): ""I use the word 'customers' in referring to the OCC's deliberately because to us that is what they are -- customers to whom 
we must provide the best service we can without delay or discrimination.  That attitude or policy, if you will, has been 
impressed on me by various means ever since I became involved in OCC work."" (Emphasis supplied). "
1362,250," Mr. Christian Schweitzer of Cheasapeake and Potomac Telephone testified that (S-T-80 at 2), ""I am confident that the service 
that the OCC's got was better than that provided to Long Lines."" "
1364,251," See, e.g., PX4-0173; PX4-0174; PX4-0175; PX4-0176; PX4-0177; PX4-0178; PX4-0179; PX4-0180; PX4-0282; PX4-0283; 
PX4-0284; PX4-0285; PX4-0287; PX4-0288; PX4-0289; PX4-0290; S-5165B; S-5167. "
1365,252," As Mr. Hunt testified, the Bell System has for years conducted similar reviews of various aspects of its operations (Hunt, Tr. 
4180-81).  This is a good management technique and the Court draws no adverse inference from its use in the specialized 
carrier area."
1365,253," The Court rejects SPCC's inference of poor performance from the fact that ""re-reviews"" of some operating companies were 
conducted when the original 1975 and 1976 reviews found particular problems.  It is entirely understandable to the Court that 
problems will recur or new problems develop with time. "
1366,254," Mr. Squires was the BPOC with Indiana Bell, whose job it was to ""provide quality, prompt service for the OCC's and their 
customers"" (S-T-82-4).  He further testified (id. at 8): It is my considered opinion that the company and its employees have been responsive in good faith, to such requests and 
further, have cooperated with OCC personnel in instances where problems have arisen between the company and the 
OCC respecting service and facilities."""
1366,255," This January 6, 1976, memorandum from Dennis Gundy to Paul Freels admitted that many of the problems experienced by 
SPCC were created by SPCC.  Mr. Gundy wrote (S-4016): ""Cooperation with this group (Southern California's BPOC) are very good at this time.  The only problem areas exist when 
SPC changes due dates within a short time frame or SPC finds it has ordered facilities wrong and changes the criteria 
requested from Bell without giving ample additional changes in due date requirements."" (Emphasis supplied). Again, in a June 29, 1976 memorandum to Mr. Brodman, Mr. Drew wrote (S-4362): ""We are becoming increasingly concerned about missed due dates caused by internal SPC delays.  We had hoped that 
increasing the manpower in the circuit design groups would reduce these delays. Today, another example of excessive delay was brought to our attention less than 48 hours before the due date."" Despite the admitted internal SPCC problems, the plaintiffs would want this Court to award them damages.  The Court just 
cannot understand how the defendants could be held accountable for these problems. "
1367,256," Mr. Turner of New England Bell testified (S-T-89 at 5): ""Our basic instruction was and is that all efforts must be made to provide OCC circuits on time.  The goal of providing timely 
services, barring unforeseen circumstances which occasionally have caused delays, has been strictly maintained.  The 
results of these efforts have been that the OCC's receive service as good, if not better than, those services provided to 
NET's customers."" "
1368,257," As one example, at the conclusion of the cross-examination of John Snyder, who has functioned as Pacific Telephone's 
coordinator with the specialized carriers for almost a decade, and whom the Court found to be highly credible and 
knowledgeable, Mr. Snyder answered with a simple ""Yes, sir"" to the Court's question whether a short summary of his testimony 
was that he and his organization ""have attempted in every way possible to give SPCC the best possible service"" (Tr. 4588-89)."
1368,258, Mr. William Deemer of C & P testified that (S-T-77 at): 
1369,," ""I vividly recall a Saturday afternoon call from Mr. Pope of Southern Pacific at my home.  My car was loaded, and the family 
was just ready to head for the beach.  The problem was such that I called in special forces to do the work and worked over 
the weekend.  If it had been Long Lines, I would have told them to wait until Monday."""
1369,259," In making the determination, the Court has taken account of the concerns of Mr. Ron Kinter of PT & T who stated (S-T-106 at 
3): ""There were some problems in interfacing with SPCC.  Many of the technicians were ex-Bell employees who seemed to 
have a grudge against Pacific and who really seemed to go out of their way to make things difficult for us."" "
1374,1," The factual statements are taken from the complaints filed by appellants in the district court.  For purposes of reviewing an 
order of dismissal for lack of standing, we must accept as true all material allegations of the complaints and construe them in 
favor of the complaining parties.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343, 95 S. Ct. 2197 (1975). "
1375,2," HN1[
] Section 303 provides: (a) It shall be unlawful, for the purpose of this section only, in an industry or activity affecting commerce, for any labor 
organization to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor 
Relations Act, as amended. (b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason or [of] any violation of subsection (a) may sue therefor in

sustained and the cost of the suit."
1375,29, U.S.C. § 187 (1976).
1375,3," Appellees allegedly violated section 8(b)(4)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(D) (1976), which provides in relevant part: HN2[

therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent,

suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
1376,15, U.S.C. § 15 (Supp. V 1981).
1376,5," Section 303 was proposed and enacted as an alternative to subjecting unions to antitrust liability for secondary activity.  See 93 
Cong. Rec. 4834-4874 (1947) (debates over Senator Ball's proposal for antitrust sanctions and Senator Taft's compromise 
proposal for actual damages); Connell v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 634, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 
1830 (1975); Mead v. Retail Clerks International Ass'n Local No. 839, 523 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1975). While this alternative 
legislation served to reduce the punitive impact of damage awards available under the antitrust laws, section 303, like section 4, 
serves both a compensatory and deterrent function.  See 93 Cong. Rec. 4858 (1947) (Senator Taft commenting on the intended 
deterrent and remedial impact of § 303), reprinted in 2 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Relations Act, 1947, at 1371 
(1948); Jaden Electric v. IBEW, Local 211, 508 F. Supp. 983, 987 (D. N.J. 1981); see generally Comment, Standing To Sue 
Under Section 303 Of The Labor Management Relations Act, 45 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 539, 549-50 (1970). Given the close similarity in 
the terminology employed in section 4 and section 303, the fact that section 303 was enacted in lieu of applying antitrust 
sanctions for secondary activity, and the commonality of functions served by the two statutes, judicial construction of section 4 
may have influenced how Congress viewed the operative effect of section 303.  In the legislative debates leading to section 
303(b)'s inclusion in the Senate version of the Taft-Hartley amendments, Senator Morse criticized the section's apparent breadth 
and challenged its proponents to ""find another statute that has such sweeping power as is given in this bill to bring suits when 
there are secondary injuries and not primary injuries."" 93 Cong. Rec. 4872 (1947), reprinted in 2 NLRB, Legislative History of the 
Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, at 1398 (1948).  Senator Taft, the section's and bill's major sponsor, responded: The Senator asks for a parallel and I can give him one.  Under the Sherman Act the same question of boycott damage is 
subject to a suit for damages and attorneys' fees.  In this case we simply provide for the amount of the actual damages. But 
the parallel is exactly the same, only under the Sherman Act, if a group of businessmen put a small concern out of 
business, they are subject to a suit for damages.  If a labor union does the same thing, why should it not be subject to a suit 
for damages? Id. at 4872-4873. This response indicates that the section's main sponsor anticipated that the courts would fashion standing limitations under 
section 303 comparable to the limitations courts created to limit the broad language governing antitrust standing under section 4. "
1377,6," The principal problem associated with the ""direct/remote injury"" test is that the standard is inherently imprecise and has 
consequently spawned a variety of approaches leading to results which are not easily reconciled.  See United Mine Workers, 
Dist. 19 v. Osborne Mining Co., 279 F.2d 716 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 881, 5 L. Ed. 2d 103, 81 S. Ct. 169 (1960) 
(injuries sustained by a business which dealt with a primary or neutral employer are inherently ""indirect""); Gilchrist v. United Mine 
Workers, 290 F.2d 36 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 875, 7 L. Ed. 2d 76, 82 S. Ct. 120 (1961) (injury to a business contracting 
with primary employer is ""direct"" if a symbiotic economic relationship exists between the two businesses and the contractor's 
tangible property is damaged by the union's actions); Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. National Maritime Union, 206 F. Supp. 797 
(E.D. Pa. 1962) (interpreting Gilchrist to require only a close economic relationship between the plaintiff and the primary or 
neutral employer); Abbott v. Local 142, United Association of Journeymen, 429 F.2d 786 (5th Cir. 1970) (third party plaintiff has 
standing under section 303 where it is the alter ego of the primary or neutral employer); W.J. Milner & Co. v. International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 349, 476 F.2d 8 (5th Cir. 1973) (third party has standing if in ""direct line of fire"" and 
injury ""reasonably foreseeable"" by union); Sapp v. Drivers, Chauffers, and Helpers, Local 639, 542 F.2d 224 (4th Cir. 1976) 
(third party's injury direct where he was an ""object"" of the union's illegal activity)."
1377,7," In addition to the legislative history and case law suggesting that section 4 standing principles should guide our interpretation of 
section 303 standing, the circumstances compelling the Supreme Court to adopt the McCready test are equally present in the 
case before us.  In determining the parameters of standing under section 303 we assume that Congress did not intend to allow 
every person tangentially affected by a section 8(b)(4) violation to maintain an action for damages under section 303.  Cf.  Blue 
Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 102 S. Ct. at 2547-48. As in McCready, we are faced with a claim that an injury is too remote "
1378,," from the violation to warrant standing.  We are also without any direct guidance from Congress as to the point beyond which 
liability should not extend.  Id."
1378,8," Our conclusion that appellants lack standing to sue for damages under section 303 does not leave them without a remedy.  
Section 10 (K) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 160 (K) (1976) authorizes the NLRB to hear and determine 
work jurisdiction disputes upon the filing of an unfair labor practice charge under section 8(b)(4)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(D) 
(1976).  This procedure provides an expedited review and affords substantial protection to employees caught up in such a 
controversy."
1378,9," Section 303 permits recovery for injuries to ""business or property."" Appellees urge us to interpret this phrase to include only 
commercial interests or enterprises and to exclude loss of wages. We have heretofore not been called upon to determine the 
parameters of the ""business or property"" phrase contained in section 303.  The identical phrase appears, however, in section 4 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (Supp. V 1981) and it may be proper for us to look to judicial interpretations of the section 4 
phrase for guidance in construing the phrase in the context of section 303.  In Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 670 F.2d 1378 
(1982), we held that an employee has standing to sue for damages incurred as a result of his discharge for his refusal to 
participate in effectuating an antitrust conspiracy.  Id. at 1385. Although we did not expressly discuss the ""business or property"" 
limitation, it was implicit in our holding that the loss of employment in that context was within the ""business or property"" concept. "
1379,," Contrary results have been reached by other circuits on this issue.  Compare Dailey v. Quality School Plan Inc., 380 F.2d 484 
(5th Cir. 1967) (loss of employment constitutes injury to business or property); Nichols v. Spencer International Press, Inc., 
371 F.2d 332 (7th Cir. 1967) (terminated employee injured in his business or property) with Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 471 
F.2d 727 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 938, 36 L. Ed. 2d 399, 93 S. Ct. 1900 (1973) (termination of employment not injury 
to business or property unless job constitutes commercial enterprise or venture).  We note that recently the Supreme Court has 
implicitly given wide latitude to the business or property limitation in holding that a consumer of services has standing under 
section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue for harm incurred as a result of anticompetitive practices directed at the provider of those 
services.  Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982). Moreover, the Sixth 
Circuit apparently does not view loss of wages as outside the bounds of the section 303 business or property concept.  Wells v. 
International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 181, 303 F.2d 73, 75 (6th Cir. 1962). Nevertheless, we do not find it necessary 
to reach the merits of appellee's ""business or property"" argument since we have concluded that appellants lack standing on 
other grounds.  Appellees also assert that the dismissal of the suit should be affirmed on the grounds that appellants failed to 
exhaust internal union remedies provided by article XX of the AFL -- CIO Constitution, citing Santos v. District Council of 
Carpenters, 547 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1977), after remand, 619 F.2d 963 (2d Cir. 1980). Because we conclude that the suit was 
properly dismissed for lack of standing, we need not reach this argument. "

claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act. Moreover, Sunshine's brief cites this Court's utterance that ""predatory intent can be shown 
by two means: (a) by express evidence; and (b) by inference from 'below-cost' pricing."" O. Hommel Co. v. Ferro Corp., supra, 
659 F.2d at 347 (emphasis added).  However, no record was developed in the district court to support this alternative approach.

] A firm's economic costs may be divided into two categories: ""fixed"" and ""variable."" ""Fixed"" costs do not vary with 
output; they are costs that would continue even if the firm produced nothing at all.  ""Variable"" costs, on the other hand, do vary 
with changes in output. ""Average variable cost"" is the sum of all variable costs divided by output, and "" marginal cost"" represents 
the increment to total cost resulting from the production of an additional increment of output. Areeda & Turner, supra note 3, at 
700. Professors Areeda and Turner conclude that ""marginal-cost pricing is the economically sound division between acceptable, 
competitive behavior and 'below-cost' predation."" Id. at 716.  However, they recognize that a marginal-cost standard inevitably 
clashes with ""the difficulty of ascertaining a firm's marginal cost.  The incremental cost of making and selling the last unit cannot 
readily be inferred from conventional business accounts, which typically go no further than showing observed average variable 
cost."" Id. Consequently, Areeda and Turner acknowledge the need to use average variable cost as a surrogate for, or ""indicator"" 
of marginal cost."

] Predatory pricing generally implicates the Sherman Act's prohibition against attempted monopolization, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1976). This Court has held that ""two essential elements of a § 2 attempt to monopolize violation are a specific intent to 
monopolize the relevant market and sufficient market power to come dangerously close to success."" Harold Friedman, Inc. v. 
Kroger Co., 581 F.2d 1068, 1079 (3d Cir. 1978). Under Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396, 402, 49 L. Ed. 518, 25 
S. Ct. 276 (1905), attempted monopolization, like any other form of criminal ""attempt,"" also requires the existence of an act 
related in some way to the attempt.  Cf.  William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., Inc., 668 F.2d 
1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 1981) (three elements of an attempt claim are specific anti-competitive intent, ""predatory or anti-competitive 
conduct directed to accomplishing the unlawful purpose,"" and dangerous probability of success); Northeastern Telephone Co. v. 
American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, 85 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1438, 71 L. Ed. 
2d 654 (1982) (""Anticompetitive or exclusionary conduct is unquestionably a necessary element of a § 2 attempt.""); Keco 
Industries, Inc. v. Borg-Warner Corp., 334 F. Supp. 1240, 1245 (M.D. Pa. 1971) (attempted monopolization requires ""'dangerous 
probability' of a monopoly . . . together with overt acts committed in furtherance thereof"" with specific intent of achieving unlawful 
goal); 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, para. 820, at 312 (""classic formulation"" of attempted monopolization involves presence of 
intent, conduct, and dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power).  The Areeda-Turner standard comprehends the notion 
that pricing below average variable cost demonstrates the requisite intent and conduct. The most recent Third Circuit formulation of the elements of attempted monopolization, see Friedman, supra, does not expressly 
mention conduct, in contrast to the formulae propounded by Professors Areeda and Turner, supra, and enunciated in Inglis and 
Northeastern Telephone, supra. Although such a requisite would seem to be implicit in the Friedman test, we need not here 
engage in the exercise of reformulation, as the parties and the district court all appear to have assumed that evidence of conduct 
is in fact required. "
1386,10," Professors Areeda and Turner also take the position that prices below average variable cost ""should be conclusively 
presumed unlawful."" Areeda & Turner, supra note 3, at 733 (emphasis added).  Under this approach, Temple would have no 
defense to the claim of predation if Sunshine could show that the Bookstore had priced below average variable cost.  We 
intimate no views on this matter."
1386,11," The Areeda-Turner formulation has been the subject of extensive scholarly commentary. See, e.g., R. Bork, The Antitrust 
Paradox -- A Policy at War with Itself 148-55 (1978); R. Posner, Antitrust Law -- An Economic Perspective 191-93 (1976); L.

1397,2," The process of defining a relevant market is well stated by Professor Areeda: A vast number of firms might have some actual or potential effect on a defendant's behavior.  Many of them, however, will not 
have a significant effect and we attempt to exclude them from the ""relevant market"" for appraising defendant's power.  We try to 
include in the relevant market only those suppliers -- of this same or related product in the same or related geographic area -- 
whose existence significantly restrains defendant's power.  This process of inclusion and exclusion is spoken of as ""market 
definition."" P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Text, Cases P231, at 239-40 (1981). Here, generally speaking, the relevant market is restaurants similar to Waffle House -- those with similar menus, hours, and 
service. "

F.2d 1002, 1016 (5th Cir. 1972). Said another way, plaintiff must show the fact of injury which means that what the defendant did 
impacted in some way on plaintiff's business.  To show injury means that plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that it suffered 
economic damages which are quantifiable.  McClure v. Undersea Industries, 671 F.2d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir. 1982). See also

1404,1," Only AMPI and CMPC remain among the many defendants originally named in this action a decade ago.  Attrition has taken its 
toll.  Pl. Mem. 2 n.*."
1404,2," ""Chicago Regional Marketing Area"" is defined as a dairy market by the United States Department of Agriculture (""USDA"") and 
is subject to minimum price and other regulations under a so-called Federal Market Order.  See Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1180 
n.2."
1404,3," Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1179-80 described the economics of the milk industry in the Midwest.  Those economics need not be 
recounted here. "
1405,4," However, based on the District Court's findings the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of NFO's actual and attempted 
monopolization claims against Mid-Am, AMPI and CMPC.  Id. at 1191. "
1406,5," Alexander began ( id. at 1179) by referring to ""the often fierce competition in the Midwest milk industry during the late 1960's 
and early 1970's."" It pointed out that the vigorous competition really began in 1969 when NFO commenced its direct marketing 
efforts.  Id. at 1180. Mid-Am had just been formed in 1968 and AMPI in 1969.  Id."
1406,6," It is true that findings of fact relevant to the Chicago area in Midwest Milk, 510 F. Supp. at 476-87, cover the 1967-75 period, 
although it is unclear whether some occurrences cited were relevant to determination of the issue of antitrust liability. In any 
case, Oberweis (as it must) calls on Alexander for collateral estoppel effect, so Alexander's time frame would appear to govern.  
After all, the Court of Appeals reversed rather than affirming the District Court on the holding that controls here, and this Court 
must necessarily look to Alexander (not Midwest Milk) to define the scope of the Eighth Circuit's own decision. "
1407,7," AMPI is no stranger to offensive collateral estoppel, having sought to employ the doctrine in Alexander in support of its 
counterclaim against NFO.  See 687 F.2d 1173 at 1189-90."
1407,8," Like Oberweis, GAF asked inaccurately for ""partial summary judgment,"" though it sought only to preclude litigation of certain 
facts and issues.  519 F. Supp. at 1210. Unlike Oberweis, however, it properly understood its substantive burdens. GAF is apparently the only post-Parklane reported case applying collateral estoppel offensively from one private Sherman Act 
action to another.  See 15 Von Kalinowski, § 109.04[5], at 109-29 to 109-32 (1981) and July 1982 Supp. § 109.04[5], at 7 n.19.3. "
1408,9," AMPI and CMPC could also repair to the general law on issue preclusion (see Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 27-29 
(1982) -- and they did that."
1408,10," AMPI at least clearly sensed (Ans. Mem. 6, 13-14, 24-26) the basic misconception in Oberweis' motion, but it was evidently 
not confident enough to contest only the application of collateral estoppel as properly understood.  CMPC never isolated 
Oberweis' mistake. See, e.g., CMPC Ans. Mem. 23 & n.42, discussing AMPI-CMPC liability question as an issue of ""fairness"" 
and as if collateral estoppel might be invoked on the liability issue."
1408,11," AMPI and CMPC moved for and received leave to file over-length briefs on both motions.  More thought and less paper would 
have been in order and more helpful to this Court. "
1409,12," It must be remembered that before Parklane's espousal of offensive collateral estoppel, Section 5(a) had created a special 
advantage for antitrust plaintiffs against defendants who had been the targets of government action.  That had represented a 
congressional policy judgment favoring private antitrust actions. Parklane had then changed the ballgame in 1979 for all parties 
suing previously unsuccessful litigants.  Next Section 5(a)'s 1980 amendment nullified any misguided negative inference that 
formerly-favored antitrust plaintiffs suing governmental-action losers were now at a comparative disadvantage.  It would be 
bizarre indeed to read the amendment as depriving private antitrust plaintiffs of the benefits Parklane had made available to all 
other plaintiffs in every other area of law.  See GAF, 519 F. Supp. at 1210-11."
1409,13," In a related objection AMPI suggests (Ans. Mem. 1) Alexander's ""de novo"" review of the evidence was improper.  ""De novo"" 
misstates the nature of the Court of Appeals' review.  See 687 F.2d at 1191, 1193-94, 1199. But even were it otherwise, that 
would not vitiate Alexander's status as a final determination of liability on the merits. "
1410,14," It was the Eighth Circuit's view that a Sherman Act § 2 conspiracy claim needs no showing of actual attainment or ""dangerous 
probability"" of monopoly power, so long as the conspiracy affected ""some appreciable part of interstate commerce."" Id. at 1181-
82, 1192-93."
1410,15," AMPI was of course a member of CMPC (though that does not necessarily mean CMPC could be tarred with the same brush).  
Incidentally, that relationship is the basis for one last legal point raised by CMPC (Ans. Mem. 16-17) -- that AMPI and CMPC 
could not conspire together.  Apart from the group of cases upholding even parent-subsidiary conspiracies, CMPC runs directly 
counter to specific findings in Alexander about the distinction between AMPI and CMPC and the fact they acted in concert.  See 
e.g., 687 F.2d at 1180, 1194, 1197 n.22, 1207. "
1411,16," As Oberweis notes (Ans. Mem. 5-6), AMPI-CMPC in effect confess their creativity by altering a quotation from Weit v. 
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co., 641 F.2d 457, 464 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 988, 102 S. Ct. 1610, 
71 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1982), so it speaks of partial summary judgment on portions of a complaint.  See AMPI-CMPC Mem. 18. In much the same way AMPI-CMPC argue (Mem. 18 n.7) the action culminating in Illinois Brick began with a partial summary 
judgment motion granted in this District Court.  But that was a true partial summary judgment, entered against all claims by all 
indirect purchasers (not on parts of the claim of one antitrust plaintiff).  Illinois v. Ampress Brick Co., 67 F.R.D. 461, 463, 468 
(N.D. Ill. 1975), rev'd, 536 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1976), rev'd sub. nom.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 
2061 (1977). Similarly, the two other cases cited by AMPI-CMPC (R. Mem. 8 n.17) do not support their procedural posture.  First National 
Bank Co. of Clinton, Ill. v. Insurance Co. of North America, 606 F.2d 760, 763, 765 (7th Cir. 1979) upheld the district court's 
grant of partial summary judgment on plaintiff's full summary judgment motion. Saunders v. National Basketball Ass'n, 348 F. 
Supp. 649 (N.D. Ill. 1972) also involved a full Rule 56 motion. AMPI-CMPC alterations in Weit, coupled with their misuse of precedent, induce a suspicion of intentional dissembling.  More 
charitably, perhaps they were simply incapable of perceiving the distinctions discussed."
1411,17," Oberweis has now dropped its claim based on Class II milk premiums in purchases from AMPI-CMPC.  Ans. Mem. 14 n.5.  As 
to Class II milk, see Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1180."
1411,18," While this Court's ruling on the present motions was pending, Oberweis -- without appearing in court for that purpose -- 
""moved"" to supplement its Interrogatory Answers.  There is a sharp dispute as to the extent to which discovery remains open for 
that purpose, but in any case AMPI-CMPC are evidently furious over Oberweis' continuing discovery tactics.  R. Mem. 1-2, 3-8.  
Again that whole issue speaks to possible sanctions for discovery abuse (AMPI-CMPC have moved for the ultimate sanction of 
dismissal of Oberweis' entire lawsuit) and not to the propriety of a ""partial summary judgment"" on some damages evidence. "
1413,19," Allegedly the uncontrolled Oberweis suppliers would sell at ""a tad under the AMPI price."" Def. Mem. 25.  It remains to be seen, 
of course, whether at trial the difficulties of proof that led in part to rejection of a similar claim in Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. 
Continental Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 583 (3d Cir. 1979), can be overcome."
1413,20, Oberweis tried to shift gears in this regard.  Ans. Mem. 3.  That effort was both untenable and unnecessary. 
1414,21, Hence any possible issue of naming AMPI-CMPC's co-conspirators is irrelevant here. Def. R. Mem. 12-15.
1414,22," Those determinations have minimal utility (at best) in comparison with Oberweis' total claims.  Given the equally fruitless 
motion by AMPI-CMPC and the volume of paperwork generated by the current motions, their mountain of paper labored and 
brought forth a very small mouse indeed.  Horace, Ars Poetica 1. 168.  Both sides would have been better advised to expend the 
same efforts in advancing this decade-old action toward trial.  And this Court would have been spared the writing of an 
inordinately long opinion. "
1417,1," Plaintiff argues that, under the terms of an Order entered by this Court on May 10, 1982, all motions to dismiss or for summary 
judgment were required to be filed by October 12, 1982, and that, since defendant's summary judgment motion was not filed 
until October 13, 1982, the motion was untimely and should be denied.  See Plaintiff's Brief in Response to Defendant Georgia 
Power Company's Motion for Summary Judgment, 1-4 (November 19, 1982).  Since plaintiff claims no prejudice to it resulting 
from the alleged late filing (plaintiff, in fact, admits being served with a copy of defendant's summary judgment motion on 
October 12) and since the Court finds considerable merit in defendant's motion, the Court believes that the purposes of justice 
are better served by considering the merits of defendant's motion than by rigidly enforcing a rather complicated series of filing 
requirements. "

(1980), the Third Circuit gave the following explanation of the nonstatutory exemption: ""The term nonstatutory exemption, 
commonly used in discussing the interface between the often conflicting national antitrust and labor policies, is a shorthand 
description of an interpretation of the Sherman Act, making that statute inapplicable to restraints imposed in the interest of lawful 
union monopoly power in the labor market."" Id. at 513. The Third Circuit also explained that ""the rationale of the exemption is 
protection of the union's power to eliminate competition in the labor market over wages and working conditions.  Restraints "
1420,," operating on that primary market are presumptively outside the scope of the Sherman Act . . . .  But restraints . . . which are 
aimed at controlling a secondary product or service market are suspect, and are presumptively covered by the Sherman Act."" Id. 
at 514. One commentator argues persuasively that subcontracting restraints are properly classified as primary labor-market 
restraints, as long as such restraints are not used to fix prices or allocate product markets a la Allen Bradley Co. v. Local No. 3, 
IBEW, 325 U.S. 797, 89 L. Ed. 1939, 65 S. Ct. 1533 (1945). Leslie, Principles of Labor Antitrust, 66 Va. L. Rev. 1183 (1980)."
1420,4," Although the nonstatutory labor exemption has been most commonly asserted by the labor unions themselves, in this case it is 
the employer who seeks the protection of the exemptions. When an agreement with a union forms the basis of an antitrust claim 
against an employer, the employer may assert the labor exemption if the exemption would have been available to the union.  
The reasoning of the Seventh Circuit on this point is quite persuasive: Although both the statutory and the nonstatutory exemptions are generally phrased as exemptions for union behavior, logic 
dictates that they be applied to all parties when an agreement with a union forms the basis of a complaint.  The exemptions 
would serve little purpose in furthering national labor policy if employers risked liability under the antitrust laws for entering 
into collective bargaining agreements.  Other circuits have concurred in this judgment.  ""To preserve the integrity of the 
negotiating process, employers who bargain in good faith must be entitled to claim the antitrust exemption."" Scooper

1421,5," See Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, 654 F.2d 1301 (9th Cir. 1981), aff'd in 
pertinent part sub nom.  Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 102 S. Ct. 2071, 72 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1982), for a 
very detailed review of the legislative history and judicial development of the construction-industry proviso. "
1422,6," Georgia Power argues that the alleged subcontracting clause should be protected by the construction-industry proviso even if 
no collective-bargaining relationship existed between Georgia Power and the Trades Council.  This argument is based on the 
contention that Connell makes the construction-industry proviso applicable if a collective-bargaining relationship is found or the 
subcontracting agreement is restricted to a single work site. See Connell, supra 421 U.S. at 633, 44 L. Ed. 2d at 432 (proviso 
""extends only to agreements in the context of collective bargaining relationships and . . . possibly to common-situs relationships 
on particular jobsites as well""); see also Pacific Northwest Chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, 654 F.2d 
1301, 1317-1321 (9th Cir. 1981), aff'd in part and vacated in part, Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 102 
S. Ct. 2071, 72 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1982). Since this Court finds that the alleged subcontracting agreement was reached in the context of a collective-bargaining 
relationship and was restricted to a single site, the Court makes no determination as to the validity of Georgia Power's argument 
that the single-site limitation is alone sufficient to invoke the construction-industry proviso."
1422,7," Georgia Power also contends that the prehire agreement matured or ripened into a full-fledged collective-bargaining agreement 
when Georgia Power hired employees through the craft unions to work at Plant Vogtle.  See NLRB v. Local 103, Iron Workers, 
434 U.S. 335, 54 L. Ed. 2d 586, 98 S. Ct. 651 (1978); NLRB v. Haberman Construction Co., 641 F.2d 351, 357 (5th Cir. 1981) 
(en banc); Giordano Construction Co., 256 NLRB No. 10 (May 18, 1981), cited with approval in Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. 
v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645,    , 72 L. Ed. 2d 398, 414, 102 S. Ct. 2071 (1982). Since this Court is prepared to hold that a § 8(f) 
prehire agreement constitutes a collective-bargaining relationship within the meaning of Connell, it is unnecessary to decide 
whether the prehire agreement in question actually matured into a § 9(a) collective-bargaining agreement.  Thus, the Court finds 
the fact that Georgia Power eventually hired employees from only 8 or 9 of the 13 signatory unions to be legally insignificant in 
the present circumstances. "
1424,8," Adams also argues that the Project Agreement was not a collective-bargaining agreement nor a labor agreement of any kind 
because Georgia Power's chief negotiator of the Project Agreement refused to characterize it as a collective-bargaining 
agreement or labor agreement.  Whether parties apply legally correct labels to the agreement is irrelevant.  Whether or not this 
Court should consider the Project Agreement to be part of a collective-bargaining context is a question of law. "

Olsen held that a state may regulate pilotage, even though such regulates commerce, until such time as federal laws should 
override or preempt the area.  The comparison was that in Lowenstein the lower court had held that HN2[
] a state was neither 
a ""person"" nor a ""corporation"" within the meaning of the Act of Congress dealing with monopolies and trusts.  Therefore, the 
South Carolina law regulating the liquor trade was a state monopoly enforced by the governor, secretary of state, and controller.  
The law did not create a monopoly in those individuals; rather, they were mere instrumentalities of the state acting as and for the 
state.  As such, the monopoly was immune from antitrust prosecution as an action of the state as sovereign."

meeting the expenditures of the statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), which includes expenditures for 
capital improvement projects approved by the legislature.  Such charges shall be reasonable and uniform for the same 
class of privilege, service, or thing. The department shall enter into separate contracts with no more than two persons (""contractors"") for the sale and delivery 
of in-bond merchandise at Honolulu International Airport, in the manner provided by law.  Each such contract shall confer 
the right to operate and maintain commercial facilities within the airport for the sale of in-bond merchandise and the right to 
deliver to the airport in-bond merchandise for sale to departing foreign-bound passengers. HN14[
] The department shall grant such contracts pursuant to the laws of this State and may take into consideration: (1) The payments to be made on in-bond merchandise sold at Honolulu International Airport and on in-bond merchandise 
displayed or sold elsewhere in the State and delivered to the airport; (2) The ability of the applicant to comply with all federal and state rules and regulations concerning the sale and delivery of 
in-bond merchandise; and (3) The reputation, experience, and financial capability of the applicant. The department shall actively supervise the operation of the contractors to insure its effectiveness.  The department shall 
develop and implement such guidelines as it may find necessary and proper to actively supervise the operations of such 
contractors, and shall include guidelines relating to the department's review of the reasonableness of contractors' price 
schedules, quality of merchandise, merchandise assortment, operations, and service to customers. Apart from the contracts described above, during the period ending June 30, 1982, the department shall confer no right 
upon any person to offer to sell, sell, or deliver in-bond merchandise at Honolulu International Airport. (b) Under other operation.  HN15[
] The department may, by contract, lease, or other arrangement, upon a consideration 
fixed by it, grant to any qualified person the privilege of operating, as agent of the State or otherwise, any airport owned or 
controlled by the department; provided that no such person shall be granted any authority to operate the airport other than 
as a public airport or to enter into any contracts, leases, or other arrangements in connection with the operation of the 
airport which the department might not have undertaken under subsection (a) of this section. (c) Miscellaneous fees and charges.  The department may fix and regulate, from time to time, reasonable landing fees for 
aircraft and other reasonable charges for the use and enjoyment of the airports and the services and facilities furnished by 
the department in connection therewith, including the establishment of a statewide landing fee which may vary among 
different classes of users such as foreign carriers, domestic carriers, inter-island carriers, air taxi operators and such other 
classes as may be determined by the director of transportation, for the purpose of meeting the expenditures of the 
statewide system of airports set forth in section 261-5(a), which includes expenditures for capital improvement projects 
approved by the legislature. "

facility owned or operated by the department, the department shall have liens on the property, which shall be enforceable 
by it as provided by sections 507-18 to 507-22. (e) Buildings and land areas for general aviation activities; developmental rates. HN16[
] The department may from time 
to time establish developmental rates for buildings and land areas used exclusively for general aviation activities at rates 
not less than fifty per cent of the fair market rentals of the buildings and land areas and may restrict the extent of buildings 
and land areas to be utilized.  [L 1947, c 32, pt of § 1; am L 1949, c 374, § 1; am L 1953, JR 14, § 1; RL 1955, § 15-12; am

system of airports and to comply with section 39-59; provided that as long as sufficient revenues are generated to meet 
such expenditures, the director of transportation may, in his discretion, grant a rebate of the aviation fuel taxes paid into the 
airport revenue fund during a fiscal year pursuant to sections 243-4(a) (2) and 248-8 to any person who has paid airport 
use charges or landing fees during such fiscal year.  Such rebate may be granted during the next succeeding fiscal year but

However, South Carolina exercised direct control and management over the pricing and sale of all liquors. Cf.  Rice v. Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Appeals Bd., 21 Cal. 3d 431, 579 P.2d 476, 146 Cal. Rptr. 585 (1978) in which the prices were established by 
the producers with the state exercising no control or pointed re-examination of those prices to insure that policies of the 
Sherman Act are not unnecessarily subordinated.  21 Cal. 3d at 445, 579 P.2d at 486. While the Court indicates that the 
threshold question is whether the action violates the Sherman Act, Midcal, 445 U.S. at 102, the threshold question in that inquiry 
is the extent of direct control and supervision of the activity by the state, such as to provide Parker immunity. 445 U.S. at 103-
104. It is only after a failure at this hurdle that the Court must continue on to examine the extent of the state's mandate and 
review of the activity. Obviously if the Court had found direct state action and control there is no need for further examination."

as a sovereign under the Constitution. 455 U.S. at 53, 102 S. Ct. at 842. In advancing the Midcal analysis, the High Court merely 
declined to ""automatically"" extend the state sovereign's right to Parker immunity to ""cities, counties, and other organized bodies.""

1445,47," Read in conjunction with the broad powers enunciated in § 261-7, it is clear that the legislature has considered and condones 
the use of exclusive contracts by DOT and its various concessioners. Indeed in one case the legislature experimented in 1981 
(H.B. 1470, Act 243 of the 1981 Session Laws) with specifically requiring the DOT to provide at least two duty-free in-bond 
concessions at the airport and then finding that unacceptable, not only returned the statute to the status quo, but mandated a 
sole source duty-free in-bond concession at the airport. (Act 90, S.B. 2261-82 S.D.2 of the 1982 Session Laws.) This approval of 
exclusive contracts by the legislature emphasizes the already clear mandate by the state that DOT has the power and authority 
to enter such contracts with such parties as will best serve the public's interest and provide adequate funds for the airport 
system.  See also nn. 32, 33 & 35, supra."

] The director of transportation may perform such acts, issue and 
amend such orders, adopt such reasonable general or special rules and procedures, and establish such minimum 
standards, consistent with this chapter, as the director deems necessary to carry out this chapter and to perform the duties 
assigned thereunder, all commensurate with and for the purpose of protecting and insuring the general public interest and 
safety, the safety of persons operating, using, or traveling in aircraft, and the safety of persons and property on land or 
water, and developing and promoting aeronautics in the State.  No rule of the director shall apply to airports or air 
navigation facilities owned or operated by the United States. HN22[
] In furtherance of the duties assigned under this chapter, the director may adopt rules relating to: (1) Safety measures, requirements and practices in or about the airport premises; (2) The licensing and regulation of persons engaged in commercial activities in or about the airport premises; (3) The regulation of equipment and motor vehicles operated in or about the airport operational area; (4) Airport security measures or requirements, and designation of sterile passenger holding areas and operational areas; (5) The regulation of motor vehicles and traffic; (6) Any other matter relating to the health, safety and welfare of the general public and persons operating, using, or 
traveling in aircraft. (b) Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, if not inconsistent with the context: ""Sterile passenger holding area"" means any portion of a public airport designated by the director and identified by 
appropriate signs as an area into which access is conditioned upon the prior inspection of persons and property in 
accordance with the approved Federal Aviation Administration air carrier screening program. ""Operational area"" means any portion of a public airport, from which access by the public is prohibited by fences or 
appropriate signs, and which is not leased or demised to anyone for exclusive use and includes runways, taxiways, all 
ramps, cargo ramps and apron areas, aircraft parking and storage areas, fuel storage areas, maintenance areas, and any 
other area of a public airport used or intended to be used for landing, takeoff or surface maneuvering of aircraft or used for 
embarkation or debarkation of passengers. Notwithstanding the restriction on access by the public into operational areas, entry may be authorized for airport 
operational area related purposes with the prior permission of the director or his duly authorized representative. "

1446,50," Of course when one considers that the DOT is composed of officers and agents of the state, the question becomes facetious.  
But for the sake of argument and in the hopes of exposing exactly why a Midcal analysis is unnecessary in such cases as this 
one, the court will overlook this obvious discontinuity.  Especially since at least one other judge, sitting by designation in this 
district, overlooked this relationship and failed to grant the DOT state-action immunity for a similar exclusive concession contract 
at HIA, this court wishes to spell out quite clearly this symbiosis.  Cf. Lei, Inc. v. Photo Management, Inc., Civ. No. 78-0263 
(Opinion & Order filed February 4, 1980, by Judge Stanley Weigel).  In short, the DOT is but an instrumentality created by the 
state to conduct certain specific state policies.  The DOT exists only because of the state's grant of authority and only to perform 
the specific mandates outlined in its Organic Act.  See nn. 51 & 53, infra, and accompanying text."

commerce among the several States . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."""
1463,4," AT&T also filed a counterclaim against MCI alleging that MCI attempted and conspired to monopolize the relevant market and 
actually monopolized the St. Louis-Chicago segment, conspired to restrain trade in the relevant market, and wrongfully acquired 
stock or share capital of other corporations, which substantially lessened competition.  The district court did not permit any of 
these allegations to go to the jury, and AT&T does not challenge the propriety of that action on appeal."
1463,5," The district court directed a verdict in favor of AT&T on the following seven allegations: (1) inducing Western Union to file a 
tariff which mirrored the St. Louis-Chicago charges of MCI; (2) increasing AT&T's capacity to conduct business in data 
communications for the purpose of destroying competition; (3) introducing experimental service to discourage potential 
customers from dealing with MCI; (4) disparaging MCI; (5) bringing sham proceedings before certain administrative and judicial 
bodies; (6) participating in a massive public propaganda campaign conducted against MCI; and (7) refusing to provide Joint 
Telpak (a special tariff) to MCI.  MCI does not challenge the propriety of the district court's directed verdict on any of these 
issues."
1463,6," The Special Verdict is reprinted in the Appendix.  See infra, p. 1207."

1464,8," Local exchange telephone service is the ordinary service provided in nearly all homes and businesses.  From a technical 
standpoint, it involves a wire connection between the telephone set and a switching machine in a nearby telephone company 
central office which is connected by transmission trunks to the switching machines in other central offices within the exchange 
area.  When the telephone is taken off the hook -- or in the case of multiple telephones behind a private branch exchange, when 
a designated access code such as ""9"" is dialed -- a signal is sent to the central office.  The switching machine in the central 
office responds to this signal by sending a dial tone that enables the calling party to dial any telephone connected to the 
switched network within that exchange area.  See DX 1828."
1464,9," Long distance service operates in a manner similar to local exchange service but typically involves a two-step process in which 
the user first gains access to the local switching machine through a dial tone and then requests access to the long distance toll 
switching machine by dialing an area code plus the number of the telephone the calling party wishes to reach.  If a circuit is 
available to handle the call, it is routed through the calling party's central office to a toll office nearby, over an intercity circuit to a 
toll office in the city that is being called, and finally through the central office that serves the called telephone to that telephone. 
Wade, Tr. 3903-04; Marshall, Tr. 4893; DX 1828, 1833."
1464,10," From a technical standpoint, FX and CCSA services are similar to local exchange service in that they provide a connection 
into a switching machine in a telephone company central office which responds to requests for network access by sending a dial 
tone.  The distinguishing aspect of FX service is that the switching machine to which the telephone is connected is not located in 
the nearby telephone company central office but is in a distant office, as, for example, where a telephone located in Chicago is 
connected to a switching machine in New York City.  Such an arrangement permits the user to make and receive calls in the 
distant city as though they were local calls, i.e., as if the subscriber had a local telephone in the distant city.  For this reason, FX 
service is frequently used by such businesses as airlines and hotel reservation agents. CCSA service offers a similar advantage to large subscribers who wish to link far flung branches or offices to each other via 
private telephone lines connected through switches in the local telephone company office.  In essence, CCSA service allows a 
large subscriber to obtain a personal mini version of the nationwide telephone network.  The FTS line that connects federal 
government offices is one example of a CCSA-type service."
1464,11," In this opinion, Microwave Communications, Inc., as well as its successor corporations, are collectively referred to as MCI. "
1465,12," The general service carriers argued that the entry of specialized common carriers into the telecommunications industry would 
be contrary to the public interest because telecommunications services could be provided more economically by a single 
supplier; because additional microwave systems would be duplicative and wasteful; and because specialized carriers without 
general service responsibilities would ""cream-skim"" the existing averaged rate structure by selectively competing only along the 
most profitable long distance routes, thus imposing a heavier rate burden on low density and local telephone users."

draftsmanship I have ever seen."" Tr. 3785. "

1466,16," Multipoint service involves a situation in which a customer has an AT&T private line between Cities A and B, and an MCI 
private line between Cities B and C.  MCI claimed that it was entitled to an interconnection between its terminal and the AT&T 
terminal in City B so that the customer could obtain direct, MCI-provided service between City A and City C.  Revenues for the 
City A to City B segment would, of course, redound to AT&T.  See infra, pp. 1147-1150. "
1467,17," Before its 1974 clarification, the FCC had taken the position, in a brief filed in the Ninth Circuit, that the Specialized Common 
Carriers decision did not permit the offering of ""switched"" service (such as FX and CCSA service). This apparent contradiction in 
the FCC's position was fully presented at trial. "

1469,20," AT&T had initiated studies to consider a deaveraged rate structure as early as 1970, shortly after the FCC's approval of MCI's 
Chicago-St. Louis line.  The initial proposal resulting from those studies was a so-called ""exception tariff"" which would have 
matched MCI's rate over the Chicago-St. Louis route as soon as MCI commenced operations.  Warned by its economic advisors 
that such an exception tariff could be perceived as violative of the antitrust laws, AT&T decided against this approach and opted, 
instead, for the development of a broadly deaveraged national rate structure.  deButts, Tr. 4038-39."
1469,21," The revenue projections for the ""undamaged"" MCI were adjusted downward to account for some delays and uncertainties that 
MCI officials felt were not fairly attributable to AT&T.  See Uhl, Tr. 3228-37; PX 1203."
1469,22, MCI assumed that the effects of AT&T's allegedly unlawful conduct would be completely eliminated as of 1995. 
1470,23," MCI countered this contention by arguing, inter alia, that AT&T's Telpak rate computations did not include applicable 
termination charges and that they failed to account for the percentage of base capacity actually used by a customer (the ""fill 
factor"").  See infra, pp. 1165-1166."

1484,46," ""Average total cost"" as we use it here refers to average total economic cost, as the term is employed by economists in 
predatory pricing analysis.  See generally Brodley & Hay, Predatory Pricing.  The term ""average total costs"" is also sometimes 
used in utility ratemaking to refer to the revenue required to meet all the accounting costs of an entire utility enterprise.  See 
infra, note 52."
1484,47," No objection has been made in the instant case to the introduction of fully distributed cost evidence.  Thus, nothing in this 
opinion should be construed as reflecting on the admissibility of fully distributed cost evidence.  Under some circumstances -- for 
example, the operation of a single product enterprise in a stable economy -- average balance sheet costs may provide an 
acceptable proxy for LRIC. See R. Posner, supra, at 190.  The use of FDC, as a proxy, in various contexts, is always open to 
examination."
1484,48," Thus, various FDC methods will normally produce quite different calculations of the cost of a product or service.  In one 
electric utility rate case one witness testified to the existence of at least 29 different methods of apportioning costs among 
services.  J. Bonbright, Principles of Public Utility Rates 351 (1961).  The FCC itself has required AT&T to submit at least seven 
different FDC cost studies.  In the instant case, cost studies using these seven different FDC methods were introduced at trial.  
Not surprisingly, each method yielded a significantly different cost profile. A simple example helps to highlight the arbitrariness of FDC methodology.  Imagine a railroad line that simultaneously transports 
three different products: gold, lead and feathers.  If the railroad attempted to calculate, on a fully distributed cost basis, the cost 
of shipping each of these products, it would reach radically different results depending on whether it allocated joint and common 
costs on the basis of the value, weight, or bulk of the respective commodities shipped."

1485,50," This decision path illustrates that LRIC analysis is not, as the dissent suggests, a solely theoretical view of the question, but is, 
in fact, a meaningful representation of the implicit issues considered in the making of business decisions in the real world."
1485,51," MCI has cited no economic authority beyond the testimony of its own expert, Dr. Melody, which supports fully distributed cost 
as a measure of average total cost.  Similarly, MCI has cited no economic authority supporting the use of fully distributed cost in 
an antitrust context.  But cf. Noll & Rivlin, Regulating Prices in Competitive Markets, 82 Yale L.J. 1426 (1973) (use of 
incremental cost methods in setting regulated prices may invite predatory pricing). See generally Melody, Comment, in New 
Dimensions in Public Utility Pricing 205 (H. Trebing ed. 1976) (discussing the problems of marginal cost information in regulatory 
contexts); Melody, The Marginal Utility of Marginal Analysis in Public Policy Formulation, 8 J. Econ. Issues 287 (1974). "
1486,52," Unfortunately the terms ""average total cost"" or ""average total costs"" have been used ambiguously. As we use ""average total 
cost"" in this opinion, we mean average total economic cost, i.e., costs on a forward-looking basis.  See generally 1 A. Kahn, 
supra, at 73-74, 130-33.  For a particular product or service of a multiproduct business ""average total cost"" is defined 
differentially as the average long-run incremental cost of the product or service in question.  The term ""average total costs"" has 
also been used in quite a different sense in a utility ratemaking setting to refer to the revenues required to meet all the 
accounting, historical or embedded costs of the entire utility enterprise.  See Bonbright, supra, at 300.  This latter usage of 
""average total costs"" is not applicable here since we are concerned with the economic cost of a particular service of a 
multiservice business.  Such a cost must be one which is caused by the particular service in question.  Cf., Brodley & Hay, 
Predatory Pricing at 780-86; Cudahy and Malko, Electric Peak-Load Pricing: Madison Gas and Beyond, 1976 Wis. L. Rev. 47, 
62."
1486,53," In Aeronautical Radio, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting a 
form of fully distributed cost methodology for purposes of evaluating proposed telephone rates. Judge Wilkey dissented, arguing 
that FDC was irrational, arbitrary and capricious even as applied to regulatory ratemaking."
1486,54," Judge Wilkey goes on to draw the parallel between this example and AT&T's pricing decisions: The parallel with the AT&T situation is obvious.  The cost for monopoly services is fixed, and will be the same whether the 
competitive services are added by AT&T or not.  The cost for the monopoly services is the equivalent of the $ 125 which 
would have been the hotel charge for Judge X; the cost for the competitive services would be the additional $ 25 which 
would be added if Mrs. X enjoyed the use of the same services.  From the hotel's point of view, the additional cost for Mrs. 
X's presence is only the additional linens and food, and therefore the incremental cost for her presence is a relatively small 
amount compared to the basic cost of providing that one room and facilities for one person.  (The hotel might calculate that 
the presence of Mrs. X would generate sales in the shops on the hotel premises and thus add a small amount to hotel 
revenues, and thus the hotel could encourage her presence by charging even less than the cost of the linens and food and 
still make a profit on the incremental services.  Similar comparisons might be made to AT&T services.) To apply fully distributed costs to the stay of the couple at the hotel is economic nonsense; it is unquestionably true that 
considered ab initio the cost of providing the room and food for the two persons can be divided equally, $ 75 apiece, but 
this bears no relation to the economic logic of the way to conduct a hotel business or to conduct a moot court board's "
1487,," business either.  What the moot court board was faced with from the start was paying the total expenses of Judge X, which 
amounted to $ 125 at the price charged by the hotel.  Similarly, the price charged by the hotel for Judge X individually was 
what it cost to put one person in the room and provide meals and all services, with a reasonable profit. Both the hotel and the moot court board should logically and sensibly run their business on an incremental cost basis, just 
as is advocated by AT&T and the Antitrust Division in our case.  The basic cost of having Judge X come to the moot court 
is going to be $ 125 a day whether Mrs. X comes or not.  The board is logically forced to pay this price.  The advent of Mrs. 
X is something entirely within the control of Judge X; she can come or not, and if she does come, there is no moral or 
economic right of the moot court board to profit by the incremental service the hotel is providing for Mrs. X by reducing the 
cost allocated to Judge X's presence, which logically still remains at $ 125 a day and is not either economically or equitably 
reducible to $ 75. Similarly, the charges which the monopoly customers of AT&T have been paying and which have been previously 
determined as fair, based on the costs of AT&T in providing these services, should not necessarily be reduced simply 
because AT&T can inaugurate other services in the competitive market.  The costs properly allocated to the new 
competitive services of AT&T are incremental costs, not fully distributed costs, because the costs of the monopoly services 
should remain the same irrespective of whether AT&T enters competitive markets or not.  (Actually, as shown by the 
detailed economic exposition above, there is hope that the competitive services of AT&T, with incremental cost pricing, will 
definitely contribute to a lowering of costs for the monopoly service customers.)"
1487,642, F.2d at 1245-47 n.52. 
1488,55," We regard this case as being tried under a stipulation that a form of average total cost would be used to determine predation.  
Thus, we analyze whether LRIC or FDC is the most meaningful economic measure of average total cost.  This analysis should 
not be construed as a rejection of the Areeda-Turner rule using average variable costs.  We affirm our previous holding in 
Chillicothe that pricing below average variable cost is normally one of the most relevant indications of predatory pricing. "
1489,56," The trial court in Hommel, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 
18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 1326 (1967), had allowed the jury to hear evidence of defendant's pricing below total cost.  See 472 
F. Supp. 793, 795-97 (W.D. Pa. 1979). On this evidence the jury found for the plaintiff on a Robinson-Patman violation, but not 
on a section 2 Sherman Act violation. Hence, on appeal, the Third Circuit faced only the issue of the appropriate pricing standard 
in price discrimination cases.  Without ruling on the question whether the standards for predatory pricing were the same for both 
price discrimination and monopolization, the Third Circuit reversed the district court and entered judgment for the defendant, in 
part because of the absence of any evidence that prices were below average variable cost.  659 F.2d at 350-53."
1489,57," An important, but presently theoretical, issue not directly before this court is the propriety of using short-run marginal cost (as 
opposed to some measure of average total cost) in predatory pricing cases involving industries with high entry barriers.  Several 
courts have suggested that exceptions to the Areeda-Turner rules may be appropriate where entry barriers are high -- one of the 
circumstances in which true predatory pricing is more likely to occur.  See, e.g., International Air Industries v. American Excelsior 
Co., 517 F.2d at 724; Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1358 n.5 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 50 L. Ed. 
2d 792, 97 S. Ct. 813 (1977); cf.  Northeastern Telephone, 651 F.2d at 89 (barriers to entry into business telephone equipment 
market ""relatively low""). There is some evidence that barriers to entry may be high in the long distance telecommunications field.  There is also evidence, 
however, that the development of microwave technology has significantly lowered those barriers.  See Note, Recent Federal 
Actions Affecting Long Distance Telecommunications: A Survey of Issues Affecting the Microwave Specialized Common 
Carriers Industry, 43 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 878, 894 (1975). Because both parties here have argued for measures of average total 
cost, we do not reach this question except to note that one of the principal barriers to entry in the telecommunications industry is 
the need for FCC permission to enter the field.  Since the FCC has extensive powers to open up the telecommunications 
industry to new competition and to ""fine tune"" the permissible competitive prices by regulation, any such barriers to entry may 
not be of overriding concern in an antitrust context. "
1490,58," How practically to compute LRIC (including the possible use of proxies, where appropriate, cf. Brodley & Hay, Predatory 
Pricing at 780-86) is a matter which we believe to be quite manageable and capable of development on an ongoing basis."
1490,59," We do not intend to imply that in all cases and in all circumstances we would only examine the price-cost relationship of a 
product or service.  Our test merely suggests that a judge or jury may not infer predatory intent unless price is below long-run 
incremental cost. Thus, we agree, at least in principle, with Judge Wood's advocacy of the use of non-economic (or less rigorous 
economic) evidence in some cases.  Considering, however, among other things, the extent of regulatory control over entry and 
prices in the present case, and the highly ambiguous nature of the non-economic evidence which has been submitted, we think 
the price-cost relationship must be determinative.  But, of course, some future case may admit more scope for ""other factors."" 
Chillicothe, 615 F.2d at 432. In any event a strong presumption of lawfulness must attach when price is shown in a case like this 
one to be above an appropriately derived measure of long-run incremental cost.  MCI has offered no credible direct evidence of 
intent that, in our view, directly rebuts this presumption."
1490,60," The implication of MCI's theory would be that a multiservice firm must earn a rate of return for each service at least equal to its 
overall cost of capital for the firm.  Such a requirement is illogical since a firm's overall cost of capital is based on the level of risk 
in investing in the firm and not in an individual service faced with particularized risks and competitive conditions.  Also, to the "
1491,," extent all the services face competition, a demand that in the aggregate they earn the overall cost of capital suggests that, to the 
degree some services exceed this figure, others will fall short and thus arbitrarily appear ""predatory."" In any event, rate of return 
calculations must be based on a host of arbitrary apportionments of plant and expenses. "
1492,61," We recognize, of course, that under the consent decree approved in United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131, 43 Antitrust & 
Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA) No. 1077 (Spec. Supp. Aug. 12, 1982), Bell's local operating companies will no longer be corporately 
linked to AT&T's long distance telephone service."
1492,62," Of course, quite apart from antitrust pricing standards in this regulated industry, the regulatory agencies can evaluate 
competitive prices by whatever standards they deem economically or socially desirable, including FDC.  See Aeronautical 
Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 206 U.S. App. D.C. 253, 642 F.2d 1221, 1222 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 920, 68 L. Ed. 2d 
311, 101 S. Ct. 1998 (1981). In this connection, although there may be some merit to the courts' fashioning an antitrust rule of liability addressing limit pricing 
(or other ""strategic"" practices) as discussed by the dissent, administration might be difficult.  See infra, pp. 1181-82.  Further, 
Prof. Baumol's proposal of a quasi-permanent pricing approach (and other like proposals) may have promise if apparent 
problems of administration can be solved.  See Baumol, Quasi-Permanence of Price Reductions: A Policy for Prevention of 
Predatory Pricing, 89 Yale L.J. 1 (1979). In any event, no evidence was presented based on such theories in this case."
1492,63," MCI belatedly argues that it was not required to prove that the Hi-D circuits were priced below cost but that Hi-Lo as a whole 
was priced below cost. This argument defies logic as well as MCI's proof.  The Hi-D circuits were the only portion of the long 
distance market in which AT&T lowered its price.  The Lo-D and short haul portions of the market were subject to substantial 
price increases.  Further, Dr. Melody's testimony bolsters the notion that only the price cuts for the Hi-D circuits are relevant for 
purposes of determining predatory pricing. Dr. Melody stated that this decrease in the high density rates was AT&T's competitive 
response to MCI and, therefore, the only relevant price to be examined. Tr. 2617. "
1493,64, These were expressed in the studies as a ratio of net operating earnings to net investment. 
1494,65," Dr. Melody also testified that the ""revenue deficiency"" shown in his chart was ""greater after Hi-Lo went into effect."" Tr. 10477.  
Considered in the context of the other deficiencies in the evidence and the many variables involved, we do not consider this 
observation as evidence that Hi-Lo or Hi-D was ""below cost."""
1494,66," It appears from our review of the record that Dr. Melody used the plant and expense allocations produced by AT&T's FDC 
""Method 1"" as applied to the various years.  See supra, note 47, for a discussion of FDC methodologies.  Thus AT&T's ""net 
operating earnings"" under that method turns out for each of the years (with the possible exception of 1974) to be equal to the 
""revenue available"" in Dr. Melody's chart.  Dr. Melody did not testify that he in fact followed ""Method 1"" or why he selected that 
method if in fact he did. Of course, neither Method 1 nor any other method was espoused, or had its probative value attested to, 
by Mr. Johnston, who merely stated that these FDC studies were required by the FCC."
1494,67," Dr. Melody attempted to address this problem by testifying that ""Mr. Johnson [sic] [in his testimony] indicated that the other 
services were . . . providing a profit."" Tr. 10477. What Mr. Johnston actually said was that the other services ""were making a 
significant contribution to the earnings of the Bell System."" Tr. 6868.  This statement might mean that the other services were 
contributing on an incremental cost basis or earning a positive rate of return on a fully distributed cost basis.  The statement says 
nothing about whether the rate of return of the other services was greater or less than the overall cost of capital of the Bell 
System, which would seem to be the relevant consideration in terms of Dr. Melody's chart."
1494,68," Referring to his exhibit (PX 3915) Dr. Melody said his ""deficiency"" calculations were not intended to be ""exact or precise"" and 
that he was looking for a ""benchmark indicator."" Tr. 10476.  MCI's counsel referred to the numbers as ""ballpark figures."" Tr. 
10477. "
1496,69," AT&T is correct in arguing that the jury instructions in this case failed to reflect this standard.  Judge Grady instructed the jury 
that it could find unlawful pre-announcement if AT&T's February 26, 1973 request for special permission constituted ""the 
announcement of a price reduction by a firm with monopoly power a long time before it intends to put the reduction into effect,"" 
App. at 1205, and if the announcement ""was done not for legitimate reasons, but for the purpose of maintaining a monopoly."" Id. 
These instructions make no mention of deception or misleading conduct. Because we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of unlawful pre-announcement under the proper 
legal standard, we need not remand for a new trial on this issue."
1496,70," At one time, according to these memoranda, AT&T considered requesting an extension of the effective date of the tariff from 
the FCC.  AT&T, however, in fact made no such request and, therefore, the memoranda have little significance."
1496,71," Judge Richey, in Southern Pacific Communications Co. v. AT&T, 556 F. Supp. 825 (D.D.C. 1982), analyzed the identical 
set of circumstances and attributed the entire delay to regulatory requirements.  Slip op. at 274-77. "
1497,72," AT&T contends in its brief that the entire pre-announcement of Hi-Lo is immunized from antitrust scrutiny by the application of 
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, discussed infra pp. 1153-1158.  Inasmuch as we have concluded that the pre-announcement 
cannot be considered a violation of the antitrust laws we do not need to reach the question of immunity."
1497,73," In addition to the fact that the circuits have already been paid for, a Telpak customer wishing to utilize a previously unused 
circuit must pay additional terminal charges."
1497,74," In addition, the bulk marketing of Telpak made it comparable to the user-owned microwave systems against which it was 
designed to compete. "
1498,75," The only difference is that AT&T may physically transmit the signal over whatever circuits are available when the call is 
placed, a matter which is irrelevant to the customer and without competitive significance."
1498,76," In this connection, it is somewhat unclear from MCI's brief exactly what ""fictional"" characteristics of Telpak routing MCI 
complains of.  Our interpretation of MCI's argument differs slightly from that of Judge Richey of the District Court for the District 
of Columbia who considered a similar argument by a different specialized carrier in Southern Pacific Communications Co. v. 
AT&T, 556 F. Supp. 825 (D.D.C. 1982). Judge Richey characterized the complaint before him as alleging a situation where a 
customer having a Telpak bundle between New York City and Washington, D.C. could have calls from New York suburban 
offices to Washington, D.C. suburban points billed under the same Telpak circuit. Judge Richey upheld such an arrangement, 
stating that AT&T had done no more than recreate the same communications system that the customer would have in its own 
hypothetical private microwave system.  To the extent MCI complains of the same or an analogous problem, we think the 
answer is the same as that provided by Judge Richey."
1498,77," A switched network is one in which a customer's telephone is linked to one of the many local AT&T central offices located in 
each exchange area.  When the caller picks up his or her telephone receiver, a switching machine sends a dial tone that permits 
the caller access to switching machines in other central offices in the exchange area.  Long distance service involves this same 
process, except that upon dialing the proper area code and telephone number, the caller is shifted from the local to a long 
distance toll switching machine, which forwards the call.  See supra, at notes 8 and 9."
1498,78," FX (""foreign exchange"") service involves the connection of a subscriber's telephone to a switching machine in a distant, rather 
than a local, telephone company office.  CCSA (""common control switching arrangement"") service is used by large subscribers 
to link far-flung offices to each other by private lines connected through switches in the local telephone company's various 
offices.  See supra, at note 10. To provide both FX and CCSA, MCI would need ""local loop"" interconnections between an MCI terminal and the switch in a 
nearby AT&T central office.  MCI would pick up the local switched call and send it long distance via MCI microwave relays to the 
customer called. "
1501,79," A related argument made by AT&T is that since the Third Circuit concluded that there was room for ""legitimate dispute"" over 
the meaning of the Specialized Common Carriers decision, MCI was collaterally estopped from denying that such a legitimate 
dispute existed, and therefore the district court should have directed a verdict in favor of AT&T on the FX/CCSA issue.  Both 
AT&T and MCI were parties to the suit that gave rise to the Third Circuit's decision, which dealt with the interconnections at issue 
in the trial that spawned this appeal. AT&T's estoppel argument cannot prevail.  The Third Circuit concluded that there was legitimate room for dispute over whether 
or not certain kinds of interconnection were ordered.  The court did not say that the interconnections were not ordered, see Bell 
Tel. Co. v. FCC, 503 F.2d 1250, 1262-63 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1026, 95 S. Ct. 2620, 45 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1975), 
nor did it specifically find that AT&T believed or reasonably could have believed that denial of interconnection was justified under 
the Communications Act or the FCC decision.  The court decided only that Specialized Common Carriers was sufficiently 
unclear to warrant deferral to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.  There is no identity of issues, and thus the 
court's ""finding"" does not bind MCI here.  Of greater significance is the FCC's resolution of the interconnection question against 
AT&T. AT&T alternatively contends that in light of the Third Circuit case, Judge Grady improperly refused to give a proposed 
instruction that MCI's interconnection denial charge arose out of a legitimate dispute.  We note again that the Third Circuit stated 
that there was room for legitimate dispute, not that AT&T in fact relied on that interpretation as a basis for its interconnection 
denials.  Judge Grady properly rejected the instruction, since it was for the jury to determine whether the dispute over the 
meaning of Specialized Common Carriers was legitimate.  This is especially important here, where MCI's case included 
evidence from which it could be inferred that AT&T denied interconnections regardless of the meaning of the Specialized 
Common Carriers decision, and thus, even though the language in that decision could have given rise to a legitimate dispute, in 
this instance, it did not.  AT&T's tendered instruction was potentially misleading as to the significance of the Third Circuit 
decision. "
1502,80," AT&T asserts that the FCC's pre-Execunet opinion in the matter is due special deference because it embodies the view of the 
administrative agency responsible for enforcing the relevant statute.  To begin with, the Execunet decision holds that the FCC's 
view on this issue was inconsistent with the agency's past practice, a situation in which the agency's views are due no special 
deference.  See United States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 84, 77 L. Ed. 175, 53 S. Ct. 42 (1932). See 
generally, W. Hurst, Statutes In Court 161 (1970).  Moreover, Judge Grady permitted AT&T to argue that the FCC's expressions 
of its incorrect views made AT&T's reliance on them proper. This gave AT&T ample opportunity to lay out for the jury the 
historical context and all the facts and circumstances known to the parties at the time, consistent with the district court's 
instructions."
1502,81," This is so notwithstanding AT&T's argument that the court in Execunet recognized that other cases had not foreshadowed its 
decision.  561 F.2d at 377-78 n.59. What the D.C. Circuit meant in this respect was that different arguments had been put before "
1503,," the courts that had previously dealt with the interconnection controversy.  That the result was not foreshadowed does not 
undermine the court's conclusion that the FCC departed from established doctrine when it limited MCI in the manner involved in 
that case. Indeed, as AT&T itself acknowledges, the Execunet court's premise is that there is no limitation on a grant of service 
without a ruling to that effect by the FCC.  The court's holding that the FCC in Specialized Common Carriers did not make an 
affirmative determination that the public interest required such a limitation was clearly foreshadowed by earlier cases and is 
merely the latest application of established principles in this interconnection controversy."
1503,82," See, e.g., Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 30 L. Ed. 2d 296, 92 S. Ct. 349, (1971) (earlier holding on applicability of 
state statute of limitations would eliminate present plaintiff's right to institute suit, even though filed before earlier holding)."
1503,83," The jury was instructed that the period of liability for AT&T's acts extended between 1969 and mid-1975.  The court told the 
jury at the outset of this portion of the instruction that the Execunet decision was rendered in 1977.  Thus, AT&T's contention 
that the district court failed to instruct on the relevant time frame of the case is contradicted by the record. "
1504,84," With respect to the interconnection controversy, AT&T specifically requested an instruction explaining in great detail the 
pertinent regulatory statutes, but the district court rejected it and instead simply instructed that liability could not be found if AT&T 
had acted pursuant to a good faith interpretation of regulatory policy.  In the interconnection controversy, the inquiry focused on 
whether AT&T in fact had acted on the basis of a perceived regulatory policy.  Whether AT&T's purported belief was correct was 
not at issue since the relevant policies actually required the interconnections. Particularly in that instance the district court's more 
general instruction was sufficient. "
1505,85," AT&T challenges the admissibility of one document containing such statements.  That question is dealt with infra, slip op. at 
pp. 102-103."
1505,86," A similar inference of intent could be drawn from tariffs AT&T filed, which by their terms required AT&T to refuse FX and 
CCSA interconnections. When considered in the context of the comments noted above, the tariffs could well give rise to a 
legitimate inference by the jury that AT&T sought every avenue of obstruction to competition, while anticipating that its general 
denial of interconnections would prove unsupportable in the long-run. See infra, at pp. 1153-1158, the discussion of those tariffs. "
1506,87," MCI undercut some of this testimony on cross-examination.  One AT&T witness admitted that his view of the interconnection 
requirements of the Specialized Common Carriers decision was formed without his having read the opinion.  Another witness 
could not articulate precisely what aspects of the decision gave rise to his view that the decision limited MCI to ""point-to-point"" 
service. Other AT&T witnesses were closely examined to expose their biases or lack of knowledge about the specifics of the 
decision.  The jury was entitled to consider all this in according weight to the testimony of these witnesses and those whom MCI 
called to testify to their opposite conclusions about the meaning of the case."
1506,88," That portion of the opinion describes the options approved ""with respect to local loop service,"" 29 F.C.C.2d at 938, as 
including (a) provision of interconnection arrangements on ""reasonable terms and conditions,"" or (b) new carriers' construction of 
""their own independent local facilities to provide end-to-end service"" without the need for interconnection. Id. at 940. There is no 
limiting language about interconnections aside from the reference to ""reasonable terms and conditions."""
1506,89," This is so even acknowledging the Third Circuit's comment that the FCC's 1971 opinion was not a model of clarity.  The 
evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that AT&T seized on whatever ambiguity existed in the opinion to mask the true 
anticompetitive animus that guided its decisions. "
1507,90," Indeed, AT&T never objected on hearsay grounds to the use of the opinion, but rather on the basis that the order was 
irrelevant or else unreliable because it was purportedly obtained by MCI's fraudulent representations to the FCC.  In its Reply 
Brief, AT&T directs our attention to a portion of the transcript where it says it made an objection on hearsay grounds to the 
admission of the 1974 decision. We see nothing remotely resembling such an objection in that or any other relevant section of 
the transcript.  Rather, the cited portion of the transcript contains an objection on relevancy grounds that ""the document has 
nothing to do with the interpretation of"" the Specialized Common Carriers decision."
1507,91," AT&T claims that the opinion is not probative of the FCC's state of mind, saying that only two of the five Commissioners sitting 
at the time joined in the opinion's full reasoning.  Actually three of the five formed the majority as to the relevant portions of the 
opinion.  One of those three dissented from a single paragraph concerning an issue not raised here.  AT&T's citation of Assure 
Competitive Transp., Inc. v. United States, 629 F.2d 467 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1124, 67 L. Ed. 2d 110, 101 S. 
Ct. 941 (1981), is inapposite, since that case involved the validity of agency actions in the absence of a quorum.  Here, by 
contrast, a majority of the FCC Commissioners sitting approved the decision in relevant part, and AT&T raises no issue about 
the validity of that action on the basis that a quorum was lacking.  Cf.  Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260, 
97 S. Ct. 990 (1977) (where no majority, plurality opinion states the holding of a case)."
1507,92," AT&T notes that the 1974 decision was submitted to the jury with the prejudicial portions highlighted.  Since AT&T did not 
object to the highlighting after having an opportunity to inspect the exhibit prior to its submission, and itself highlighted portions of 
its own exhibits, we see no impropriety in the jury's receiving the marked document."
1507,93," Similarly, the district court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the 1973 injunction issued by the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Third Circuit's decision upholding the FCC's 1974 cease and desist order, and 
the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari to review that decision.  All three were probative of the reasonableness of AT&T's 
assertions of innocent motive. "
1509,94," The federal case AT&T cites for a contrary rule is based on local rules of Texas courts, as applied in that diversity action.  
Lasiter v. Washington National Insurance Co., 412 F.2d 594 (5th Cir. 1969)."
1509,95," Thus, AT&T's argument that MCI could not have been harmed because it did not have facilities in service during part of the 
time these obstructive events occurred is not convincing.  The harm was one that would have effect once MCI actually went into 
service, as well as at the time of AT&T's actions. "
1510,96," We express no opinion on the overall relationship between the doctrines of essential facilities and tying and do not mean to 
imply that a tying violation will always flow from any denial of an essential facility by a dominant firm. "
1511,97," Neither party questions the correctness of Judge Grady's instruction that MCI was not entitled to interconnections for 
geographically unlimited local facilities.  MCI contended only that the boundaries as drawn unreasonably restricted MCI's ability 
to serve its customers. For example, MCI claimed it was unreasonable for AT&T to restrict the Washington, D.C. LDA in such a 
way as to preclude necessary interconnections extending to Rockville, Maryland, a densely populated and commercial suburb 
only 13 miles from the city.  AT&T argues that there is no evidence that the LDA designations were unduly restrictive or 
constituted an improper attempt to keep MCI at a competitive disadvantage and to exclude it from the market.  There was 
conflicting evidence as to whether the LDA's were unreasonably restrictive.  This question thus became appropriate for 
resolution by the jury, and in light of the testimony and arguments concerning the restrictiveness of the LDA's, Judge Grady 
adequately instructed the jury to determine the reasonableness of the LDAs. The MCI witness whose testimony AT&T says supports the view that MCI sought geographically unlimited interconnections was 
referring only to his desire for MCI to receive reasonable interconnections for local areas.  His statement that ""there should have 
been no restriction on MCI's ability to serve its customers"" was linked directly to his expressions of concern over unreasonable 
limits on the LDAs.  The witness went on carefully to distinguish between MCI's requests for broader limits on local 
interconnections, and its desire for national ""interexchange"" facilities.  On appeal, AT&T ignores the effective distinction made by 
the witness to its counsel -- and the jury -- at trial."
1511,98," AT&T's argument that the district court failed to provide guidance to the jury on what constituted an ""essential facility"" is 
meritless.  Judge Grady carefully instructed the jury on the elements of the essential facilities doctrine (including the need for the 
jury to find that MCI could not reasonably duplicate the facility) and specifically stated that MCI contended the facilities of AT&T's 
local operating companies were ""essential"", since without them, MCI could not provide service to its customers. Moreover, the 
district court instructed the jury that the essential facilities doctrine is applicable where ""a business holds a monopoly of some 
essential facility that other businesses need in order to compete. . . ."" Since the word ""essential"" is a term of ordinary meaning, 
and since the instruction explained that the facilities involved must be those that a firm needs in order to compete, the jury was 
given adequate guidance.  Cf.  Kocher v. Creston Transfer Co., 166 F.2d 680 (3d Cir. 1948) (where enigmatic term used, jury 
may not be left to speculate on its meaning)."
1511,99," AT&T's Reply Brief on this issue cites an MCI memorandum detailing the construction of MCI facilities in South Chicago and 
Hammond, Indiana.  The memorandum appears to refer to these facilities as part of the long distance portion of MCI's planned 
service between Chicago and Cleveland, making them different in character from the local interconnections MCI sought in the 
LDA controversy. "
1512,100," AT&T argues that the essential facilities concept is not applicable here because there has been no joint refusal to deal.  
Where a monopolist controls essential services, however, its refusal to allow potential competitors to use those services gives 
rise to antitrust liability where the purpose of the denial is to restrain competition, even if the monopolist is the only one that 
controls the facility.  Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973); Official Airline 
Guides, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 630 F.2d 920, 927-28 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 917, 67 L. Ed. 2d 343, 
101 S. Ct. 1362 (1981). Otherwise, a monopolist would be able unreasonably to choke off all competition, yet escape sanctions 
simply because it was the only one in a position to do so.  The thrust of Official Airline Guides and Almeda Mall, Inc. v. Houston 
Lighting & Power Co., 615 F.2d 343 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 66 L. Ed. 2d 90, 101 S. Ct. 208 (1980), is not, as 
AT&T contends, that a joint refusal to deal is necessary in order to establish the applicability of the essential facilities concept.  
Rather, the point made in those cases is that in the absence of competition between a potential seller and a putative buyer, there 
is no room to apply the essential facilities doctrine.  Here, in contrast, AT&T and MCI are in direct competition as providers of 
long distance service.  The interconnections that MCI seeks from AT&T in the area beyond the restrictive LDAs are by definition 
a necessary component for MCI to reach its customers. The jury was entitled to find that absent a greater geographical range 
than AT&T was willing to concede, MCI would be placed at a severe competitive disadvantage.  Since MCI showed that it had 
potential customers outside the restrictive LDAs, the jury had an ample basis to conclude, that AT&T intended to undercut MCI's 
competitive potential.  Indeed, when AT&T provided the temporary interconnections pursuant to the 1973 injunction, several 
went to MCI customers beyond at least one LDA."
1512,101," It should be made clear that multipoint service, as requested by MCI, contemplated that AT&T would be entitled to all revenue 
generated by the use of AT&T lines. "
1513,102," On appeal, MCI argues that the interconnections it sought for multipoint service were ""purely local and do not involve 
provision of interstate facilities by AT&T to MCI."" Appellee's Brief at 83.  We find this argument to be somewhat disingenuous.  
While the interconnections in question involved, in a technical sense, physical facilities that were ""local,"" the purpose of these 
interconnections was to allow MCI to sell a long distance service package which included access to cities to which MCI had, as 
yet, not built its own facilities. "
1514,103," AT&T's theory on appeal is that the jury instruction for the multipoint claim conflicted with the instruction under the LDA claim.  
We find no conflict in these two instructions.  The instruction on the LDA claim, when read in context, tracks the application of 
the essential facilities doctrine to the LDA controversy.  The district court's reference to ""geographically unlimited local facilities"" 
in that instruction applied only to the LDA claim."
1514,104," Instruction 32 reads, in full: MCI claims that AT&T denied it interconnection for multipoint service.  According to the evidence, multipoint interconnection 
involved a situation where a customer ordered an AT&T private line between City A and City B, and an MCI private line 
between City B and City C, and MCI sought an interconnection between its terminal and the AT&T terminal so that the 
customer could obtain service between City A and City C. To prevail upon its claim of denials of multipoint service 
interconnections, MCI must prove that AT&T unreasonably denied those interconnections with the intent of maintaining a 
monopoly in the relevant market rather than for legitimate business reasons. App. 1203."
1514,105," Because MCI failed to request a jury instruction which would have allowed a finding of liability based upon this theory, MCI 
may not now claim as error or be entitled to a remand upon this inadequacy in the instruction actually given.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
51."
1514,106," AT&T, Offer of Facilities for Use by Other Common Carriers, 52 F.C.C.2d 727 (1975). Neither the agreement itself nor any of 
its terms was in evidence."
1514,107," We also reject AT&T's argument that MCI's injury from the inappropriate or inefficient interconnections was never specified at 
trial and so must be de minimis.  For the reasons stated in our discussion of MCI's damages, infra, p. 1168, MCI must be "
1515,," allowed to present its proof of damage without having to tightly compartmentalize its proof and without having to specify an exact 
dollar amount for each unlawful act of AT&T."
1515,108," According to the definition stipulated to by the parties, ""clean interface"" is a demarcation or method of connecting Bell 
services or facilities with non-Bell services or facilities in a manner which clearly delineates the end-to-end responsibilities of the 
carrier providing the services, obviating the necessity for joint installation, maintenance, or testing."
1515,109," As the parties stipulated, signalingis the method of telling the telephone equipment that communication is being made or has 
stopped, such as making the telephone ring or stop ringing.  E & M is one of three possible signaling systems."
1515,110," A connection in a 66-type block is formed by pushing wires down between small pins.  There are two points of connection.  In 
comparison, a 300-type connector is mounted on a frame, has a square pin, and provides 32 points of connection. "
1516,111," MCI's witness on this issue, who testified from personal experience with the reporting procedures, did not join the company 
until 1973."
1516,112," The instruction reads as follows: For plaintiffs to prevail on their claim that they were provided with inefficient or otherwise inappropriate equipment and 
procedures for interconnections, plaintiffs must establish that defendant knowingly furnished inefficient or inappropriate 
services or equipment with the intent of maintaining a monopoly in the relevant market. The basic controversy here 
concerns the equipment used by the Bell operating companies to interconnect with plaintiffs, including such things as "
1517,," connector blocks and equipment interfaces, the various kinds of signaling used by the Bell operating companies, the 
configuration of certain interconnections, such as those for Central Office Centrex Service, the provision of engineering 
information, and the procedures for coordination, installation, testing, and repairs. App. 1203."
1517,113," AT&T also asserts that the instruction permitted the jury to find against AT&T on the theory that it was under an obligation to 
make its best and most up-to-date equipment and procedures available to MCI.  Quoting from Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980), AT&T notes that 
""if a firm that has engaged in the risks and expense of research and development was required in all circumstances to share with 
its rival the benefits of these endeavors, this incentive on which the proper functioning of our competitive economy rests would 
very likely be vitiated."" Id. at 281. We find no hint of the theory to which AT&T objects in the instruction that mentioned only 
efficient and appropriate equipment and procedures, not the ""most"" efficient or appropriate ones.  The only theory contained in 
the instruction is that MCI was entitled to equipment and procedures that did not act as a hindrance.  The cases AT&T relies on 
for the contrary conclusion are inapposite.  MCI did not ask AT&T for advance knowledge of its new products, unlike the plaintiffs 
in Berkey Photo; nor did MCI suggest that AT&T abandon a technical innovation in favor of an already existing alternative as in 
Memorex Corp. v. IBM Corp., 636 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 972, 69 L. Ed. 2d 983, 101 S. Ct. 3126 
(1981). "
1519,114," This discussion of the soundness of the theoretical underpinning for allowing antitrust claims based upon a single sham claim 
or lawsuit may be unnecessary under the facts of this case.  AT&T filed the same tariff for interconnection charges with 49 
individual state commissions.  This may be regarded as a pattern of baseless claims within the language of California Motor 
Transport.  Judge Grady in denying AT&T's motion to dismiss regarded AT&T's filings as constituting just such a series of 
""baseless, repetitive claims."" MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 462 F. Supp. 1072, 1103 (N.D. Ill. 1978). We also note what is at least a theoretical question: whether Noerr-Pennington would apply to each and every filing with state 
regulators. Since Noerr-Pennington is designed to protect the right to petition the government to take some action, Noerr-
Pennington might not apply if a tariff filing is only a pro forma publication perhaps required by law and not an exercise of the right 
to petition the government.  The record does not indicate whether each state regarded the filing of the tariff as an application for 
approval or merely as a notification (formal or otherwise).  We do not reach this issue given our conclusion that these filings, 
even if ""petitions"" to which Noerr-Pennington applied, were, in any event, ""sham."" "
1520,115," At the time Bell filed its interconnection tariffs with the state utility commissions, no court had determined that the FCC had 
exclusive jurisdiction over the tariffs. The tariffs, of course, covered interconnections between interstate long distance carriers 
(regulated by the FCC) and local telephone operating companies (regulated by state agencies).  Filings, such as those involved 
here, could presumably have been made with state commissions for informational purposes, or merely on request of a 
commission, whether or not the FCC had exclusive jurisdiction. It was not until 1977 that a court directly addressed the question: what agency had jurisdiction over FX and CCSA 
interconnections. At that time the District of Columbia Circuit held that the FCC had exclusive jurisdiction over such 
interconnections. California v. FCC, 185 U.S. App. D.C. 217, 567 F.2d 84 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1010, 54 L. 
Ed. 2d 753, 98 S. Ct. 721 (1978). "
1522,116," Bad faith is defined as: The opposite of ""good faith,"" generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive 
another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to 
one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive. Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1968). "
1523,117, The business plan itself was not introduced at trial. 
1527,118," Because of the deficiency of MCI's revenue assumption we do not consider the validity of the assumptions concerning the 
size or financing of MCI's system.  With regard to MCI's assumption that it had a right to receive local interconnections from 
AT&T at the same rate as Western Union, it must be noted that the jury rejected this claim and that, in fact, MCI has paid a 
higher charge than it assumed in its lost profits study. "
1528,119," We also note that since the service terminal charge is a flat fee, the pro rata service charge depends on the length of the 
circuit.  MCI makes its pricing calculation on the basis of a 306 mile circuit.  When a 500 mile circuit is chosen for comparison the 
pro rata service termination charge is reduced and, according to MCI's own figures, Telpak's price drops to $ .82, which is below 
MCI's assumed average revenue rate."
1528,120," Although we recognize that MCI was the victim of certain unlawful acts of AT&T it should be noted that MCI never in fact 
earned anything close to $ .85 per circuit mile prior to the introduction of Execunet.  In 1975 MCI had never earned more than $ 
.63 per circuit mile. While AT&T's unlawful actions undoubtedly had some effect on MCI, it appears unlikely that the impact 
accounts for realized revenues so far below the projected revenue figure. "
1529,121," In its petition for rehearing, AT&T raised an argument that the intent evidence presented on the predatory pricing claims, 
which we reject, was inextricably interrelated with the intent evidence applicable to the findings on the interconnection claims 
which we approve. And, as a result, AT&T contends that the jury's finding on predatory pricing ""necessarily tainted "" its findings 
on the interconnection claims; hence those claims should be remanded for a new trial on liability. But we think this argument 
relies on unfounded speculation about the jury's mental processes. On the face of things, because reductions in price, unlike the 
denial of interconnections, may be pro-competitive as well as anticompetitive, we think the ""intent "" relevant to pricing is not 
necessarily closely linked to the ""intent "" relevant to refusals of interconnection. Further, the jury itself exonerated AT&T on the 
important Telpak pricing claim while finding monopolistic intent in the denials of interconnection. Particularly in the context of this 
unusual case, we believe we should balance the possibility of spillover among claims against the prejudice to the prevailing party 
in the overturning of the jury's findings. The jury's determination that Hi-Lo was predatory did not so clearly taint its ability to 
decide the interconnection claims that justice would be served by overturning the jury verdicts on these interconnection claims."
1529,122," Some have argued that the bifurcation of trials in civil antitrust cases must be approached with trepidation.  Response of 
Carolina, Inc. v. Leasco Response, Inc., 537 F.2d 1307 (5th Cir. 1976). In a private treble damage action impact or ""fact of 
damage"" is a necessary element of proving liability.  However, ""fact of damage"" and ""amount of damage"" are distinct concepts. 
As such, separate trial of these issues is beyond constitutional challenge even when the partial new trial is to be heard by a 
separate jury.  Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U.S. 494, 75 L. Ed. 1188, 51 S. Ct. 513 (1931). "
1530,123," AT&T argued in its petition for rehearing that the jury's answers to special verdict questions numbered 5(a), (c), (f), (h), (j), 
and (k) do not define the conduct found unlawful by the first jury with sufficient clarity to separate the issue of damages from the 
issue of liability so as to permit a new trial limited to the question of damages alone.  Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin 
Refining Co., 283 U.S. 494, 500, 75 L. Ed. 1188, 51 S. Ct. 513 (1931). As indicated, we believe that the district court and 
counsel can, on the basis of the record and in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this opinion, sufficiently identify the 
conduct found unlawful by the first jury to separate the issues relevant to damages for trial."
1530,124," We briefly note an additional issue which relates to the calculation of damages.  At trial, MCI argued that the damages it 
suffered must be adjusted upward to reflect the taxes which the company would pay on the award.  In its original presentation to 
the jury MCI asked for over $ 900 million so that, after taxes, it would receive approximately $ 452 million, its projected lost 
profits. Tax issues received very scant attention in the district court, yet result in an approximate doubling of the recoverable damages if 
MCI is correct in its treatment of tax effects.  It is not possible for this court to review the tax aspects of this case on the record 
before us. Rather than require additional briefs on an issue not fully dealt with below, we simply note the existence of the issue 
and leave its resolution to the proceeding on remand.  In directing the district court's attention to these issues, we particularly 
note MCI's contention that the relevant tax rate was 49.78% as well as the provisions of 26 U.S.C. § 186 (1980), which suggest "
1531,," that a portion of antitrust damages may be subject to an offsetting deduction if they have not been previously deducted as 
unrecovered losses."
1531,125," With these guidelines in mind, we note that the district court might wish to appoint a special master under the terms of Rule 
53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to aid the district court in the resolution of this case.  We leave this entirely to the 
discretion of the district court, with the further knowledge that references to a special master are to be the exception rather than 
the rule, and that the problem here may argue as much for as against such a master.  However, the language of Rule 53 permits 
reference to a master in a jury trial where ""the issues are complicated"" or in a non-jury case involving ""difficult computation of 
damages."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(b).  Reference is particularly appropriate to resolve issues ""so technical or esoteric as to be 
outside ordinary judicial competence."" Comment, Masters and Magistrates in the Federal Courts, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 779, 795 
(1975). Reference on the limited issue of the computation of lost profits seems to be within the standards announced for the use 
of special masters.  See La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 1 L. Ed. 2d 290, 77 S. Ct. 309 (1957). See generally 
Kaufman, Masters in Federal Court: Rule 53, 58 Colum. L. Rev. 452 (1958); Note, Reference of the Big Case Under Federal 
Rule 53(B): A New Meaning for the ""Exceptional Condition"" Standard, 65 Yale L.J. 1057, 1065 (1956). The question of 
appointing a special master is, of course, wholly within the district court's discretion. If the district court chooses to use a master, the reference to the master should be strictly limited to the calculation of lost profits.  
The use of an impartial and knowledgeable master might be helpful in determining the validity of assumptions used in lost profits 
studies as well as the accuracy and reliability of the costs and revenues used in the calculation of damages.  Any evidence of 
actual damages can be presented directly to the fact finder at trial since such evidence does not present the sort of extraordinary 
complexity suggesting reference. The computation of damages in an antitrust case where liability has already been established is the type of issue that has often 
been referred to a master.  District courts within this circuit have utilized this procedure in previous antitrust suits where liability 
has been established.  See, e.g., Locklin v. Day-Glo Color Corp., 429 F.2d 873 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1020, 91 
S. Ct. 582, 27 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1971). In Locklin a special master was used to calculate lost profits following the district court's 
judgment on the issue of liability in an antitrust suit.  See also Arthur Murray, Inc. v. Oliver, 364 F.2d 28 (8th Cir. 1966) (affirming 
reference for analysis of books and records in connection with antitrust award); Connecticut Importing Co. v. Frankfort 
Distilleries, Inc., 42 F. Supp. 225 (D. Conn. 1940) (special master appointed to calculate lost profits relating to an unlawful 
boycott of plaintiff's business); Eastern Fireproofing Co. v. United States Gypsum Co., 50 F.R.D. 140 (D. Mass. 1970). Again, we 
emphasize that any reference is within the discretion of the district court."
1531,126," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 provides in relevant part: In any action, the court may in its discretion direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for a conference to 
consider (1) The simplification of the issues; . . . "
1532,," The court shall make an order which recites the action taken at the conference, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, 
and the agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered and which limits the issues for trial to those 
not disposed of by admissions or agreements of counsel; and such order when entered controls the subsequent course of 
the action, unless modified at the trial to prevent manifest injustice."
1532,127,"  THE COURT: What I have tried to do here by asking you to stipulate and agree is to accomplish the substance of a pretrial 
order.  Those pretrial orders, where you list the things you disagree about -- well, that is nonsense.  I have seen those 
things that go on for pages. MR. HANLEY: You try the case on paper once and then you have to come back and try again. THE COURT: If there is anything in there that we have not covered that could be covered, we ought to do it.  But right 
offhand, I cannot think of it, and I am reluctant to impose upon anybody unnecessary paper work at this point. MR. SAUNDERS: I agree with that. THE COURT: We do not need it either.  Let's forget the pretrial order but go over it -- I have not seen one in a long time.  I 
have forgotten some of the parts of it, but if you see something in there that you think would be helpful, you can get 
together with each other. Tr. 29-30."
1532,128," The following exchange took place: MR. SAUNDERS: Judge are we going to do anything with that pretrial order that I gave to you? THE COURT: I really think there is enough in it that would be controversial that it is not worth trying to reach an agreement 
on.  The answer I think is no."
1532,129," We emphasize the value of a pretrial order, in a proper case, in facilitating the orderly conduct of a lengthy and complex trial.  
We suggest, subject of course to Judge Grady's exercise of discretion, that the full procedures of Fed. R. Civ. P. 16 be utilized 
on remand. "
1533,130," Referring to the list submitted by AT&T, the district court noted: It is almost an understatement to say that defendants' approach to this case is grandiose.  Without intending to pass upon 
any evidence questions at this time, and recognizing that I asked the parties to be very brief in describing the proposed 
subject matter of the testimony, it does appear to me that much of defendants' proposed testimony would be cumulative 
and that some of it would be irrelevant. MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 85 F.R.D. 28, 30 (N.D. Ill. 1979). The record indicates that much of AT&T's proposed 
testimony would in fact have been repetitive.  AT&T's list submitted November 14, 1979, for example, names no fewer than a 
dozen witnesses selected to present testimony on the installation of interconnection services for MCI, seven more who were to 
testify on the subject of repair services for MCI, and at least six more who were to testify concerning provision of other services 
to MCI.  AT&T also predicted that it would require between twenty-two and forty-six days to cross-examine MCI's witnesses who, 
by MCI's estimate, could be directly examined in twenty-six days."
1533,131," AT&T cites Padovani as authority for reversal.  There, the district court issued a preclusion order forbidding the plaintiff to 
introduce evidence of lay witnesses other than the plaintiff and his wife, any expert witnesses, any medical exhibits except three 
named, any evidence of damages with four exceptions, and any evidence on the issue of liability either in negligence or based 
on breach of warranty.  Finding that the order could only result in a judgment for the defendant, the Second Circuit granted 
plaintiff's petition for a writ of mandamus.  The court held that ""in no event at this pretrial stage should witnesses be excluded 
because of mere numbers, without reference to the relevancy of their testimony."" 293 F.2d at 550 (emphasis added).  In the 
case before us, the lists and summaries submitted by the parties referred to the relevancy of the testimony, and the district court 
found that some of AT&T's testimony would be irrelevant as well as needlessly cumulative. "
1534,132," The National Commission for Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures recommended in its report the imposition of time 
limits on the length of trial in extraordinarily complex antitrust litigation.  The Commission wrote: It is desirable to establish time limits for each major phase of a complex case, so that within each fixed period the litigants 
are motivated to exercise self-discipline and creative choices between alternatives. . . . Time limits for length of trial, as imposed recently in a large antitrust case, have been rarely used.  The power of judges to 
cut off cumulative, redundant presentations of proof may provide authority for the use of overall limits on trial presentations.  
As long as the limitations established are realistic and fair, and the judge prevents delaying tactics by hostile witnesses, we 
believe that trial time limits would also be an appropriate means of expediting litigation. National Commission for Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures, Report to the President and the Attorney General, 80 F.R.D. 
509, 535-36 (1979) (footnotes omitted).  See Lacey, Proposed Techniques for Streamlining Trial of Complex Antitrust Cases: 
Pro and Con, 48 Antitrust L.J. 487, 492 (1979); 1 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice, Pt. II.  (Manual For Complex Litigation) § 
4.57 (1982)."
1534,133," In this regard the following comment of AT&T's counsel to the district court is of interest, but not determinative of the issue: We are very pleased with the amount of time we have been given to deal with this kind of defense.  We have no problems 
about that at all, and I am not trying to say that we are cutting it down [on the presentation of the defense] because you are 
leaning on us.  You are not leaning on us. Tr. 6554-55. "
1536,134," In affirming the adequacy of the instructions, we note Judge Grady's remarks during the instructions conference: I hope, incidentally, that anyone who, at a later time, is critical of these instructions, will take a look at what I had to work 
with by way of the original submissions made by the parties a couple of weeks ago, by way of the plaintiffs' submissions 
and the defendants' submissions, and at least I may win somebody's sympathy, if not their approval. "
1537,1," This appeal has generated a record of monstrous proportions.  There are 11,500 pages of transcript, pleadings, motions and 
other record entries, more than 1,000 exhibits, and 45 boxes of sealed evidence and deposition.  The appellate briefs total 
nearly 600 pages, the appendices reach more than a foot in height, and in addition, there is considerable correspondence to this 
court from the parties.  Not only do we note the diverse issues upon which the parties focus, but also obscured in the small print 
of over 600 footnotes in the briefs we find countless additional issues."
1537,2," For the convenience of the reader, we reiterate here brief definitions of the various cost terms used in the majority opinion and 
this dissent.  Each term is more fully elaborated in the majority opinion, supra, at pp. 1114-1118: Marginal cost -- the additional cost of supplying a single, infinitesimally small additional unit. Average Total Cost -- the sum of all costs (fixed and variable) divided by all units of output. Long-Run Incremental Cost -- the average cost (including fixed costs) per unit of adding an entire new product or service 
rather than merely the last unit of output. Fully Distributed Cost -- in the case of a multiproduct firm, the average additional total cost per unit of adding an entire new 
product or service, including an aliquot portion of the entire firm's embedded or historical costs. The majority agrees that fully distributed cost and long-run incremental cost are merely variant definitions of average total cost, 
but argues that fully distributed cost is too ""arbitrary"" a measure of the latter.  Supra, at pp. 1116-1117. "
1538,3," That the relevant jury instruction only permitted but did not compel a finding of liability if Hi-Lo prices were under fully distributed 
cost is clear from the face of its text: ""If [prices fall below FDC], you may infer predatory intent."" App. 1205 (emphasis added). My first impression was that Judge Grady had clearly committed error by permitting the jury to decide for itself a matter which 
was the court's responsibility as a matter of law.  After becoming more involved in this case I became less sure because the 
factual circumstances influence the choice of the test to be applied and fact selection is a jury function.  It was an interesting 
experiment to permit the jury to determine, after the various approaches were explained to them, how best to determine 
predatory pricing in the unique circumstances of this case.  The jury made what I consider to be an appropriate choice.  I would 
not sanction this method generally, but it did no harm here."
1538,4," The majority moderates the harshness of its rule somewhat by holding that, in certain very lmited cases, non-cost evidence 
may be considered.  Supra, at pp. 1123, n.59.  But the majority also states that such evidence may not form the basis for an 
inference of predatory intent unless price is below long-run incremental cost.  Thus, while the majority would in narrow 
circumstances permit direct non-cost proof of predatory intent (e.g. statements by a defendant's managers outlining a strategy to 
inflict damage upon and eliminate a rival through activities other than competition on the merits), a restrictive reading would 
suggest that proof of unlawful intent through indirect evidence (e.g. internal firm cost and revenue patterns) would not be alone 
sufficient to establish liability.  If such a restrictive reading is correct, then I believe the majority's position results in an 
unnecessary and unrealistic limitation upon the predation inquiry.  As a practical matter I believe it will be a difficult rule for the 
district judge to administer with any certainty. "
1539,5," Throughout the trial and on appeal both sides argued that AT&T's liability for predatory pricing depended on whether a 
marginal or average total cost standard was applicable.  As an initial matter, therefore, I question the advisability of an appellate 
court undertaking sua sponte a complicated theoretical redefinition of economic terms, as appears to have been done in this 
case, especially where such a redefinition works to deny recovery to a plaintiff whose cost standard was the only one professed 
at trial to be consistent with the basic measure adopted by the majority, i.e. average total cost."

1541,14," This countervailing role is especially important in an area as vital to our economy as communications.  This nation's law has 
always recognized a policy in commerce that requires existing commitments to yield in favor of creative change. See W. Hurst, 
Law and the Conditions of Freedom 27 (1956). Perhaps the classic application of that policy came in the Charles River Bridge 
case, where the Supreme Court held that a legislative grant to build and operate a toll bridge across the Charles River did not 
preclude the construction and operation of a competing bridge at a later time.  Proprietors of the Charles River Bridge v. 
Proprietors of the Warren Bridge, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 420, 9 L. Ed. 773 (1837). Justice Taney's opinion for the Court is as timely 
applied to the telecommunications technology involved in the case before us as it was to the less advanced modes of 
communication considered in 1837: In a country like ours, free, active, and enterprising, continually advancing in numbers and wealth, new channels of 
communication are daily found necessary, both for travel and trade; and are essential to the comfort, convenience, and 
prosperity of the people.  A State ought never to be presumed to surrender this power [of promoting the happiness and 
prosperity of the community], because, like the taxing power, the whole community have an interest in preserving it 
undiminished. . . .  No one will question that the interest of the great body of the people of the State, would, in this instance, 
be affected by the surrender of this great line of travel to a single corporation, with the right to exact toll, and exclude 
competition for seventy years.  While the rights of private property are sacredly guarded, we must not forget that the 
community also have rights, and that the happiness and well being of every citizen depends on their faithful preservation. Id. at 547-48.  As Professor Hurst has noted, the Charles River Bridge case expresses this country's ""preferences for dynamic 
rather than static property, or for property put to creative new use rather than property content with what it is."" Hurst, supra, at 
28. As our history reveals, it would be unwise to assume that our regulatory agencies, bombarded with demands from multiple 
entrenched constituencies and guided by short-run efficiency concerns, will be as vigilant as the independent judiciary in 
vindicating this preference for ""dynamic property."" See, e.g., Regulation (J. Wilson, ed. 1979); Kolko, The Triumph of 
Conservatism (1967). "
1542,15," A new entrant's inefficiency may only be a short-run phenomenon associated with its recent start in an industry.  If a longer 
view is taken, the new entrant will progress on its ""learning curve"" and may, in fact, ultimately be more efficient than the 
dominant firm.  F. M. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 82, 250-52 (2d ed. 1980)."
1542,16," Indeed, the law of section 2 of the Sherman Act has been sensitive to the abuse of monopoly power in a way that the majority 
discounts.  The case law has even held unlawful actions by monopolists which, while lawful in themselves, evidence a purpose 
sufficient to transform monopoly into the offense of ""monopolization."" United States v. Aluminum Company of America, 148 F.2d 
416 (2d Cir. 1945) (on certifcation from the Supreme Court); United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295 
(D. Mass. 1953), aff'd per curiam, 347 U.S. 521, 74 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 910 (1954). "
1544,17," The Ninth Circuit recently applied Inglis for the first time.  In D & S Redi-Mix v. Sierra Redi-Mix and Contracting Co., 692 F.2d 
1245 (9th Cir. 1982), the court held unlawful predatory action in which a monopolist supported a subsidiary through the generous 
provision of credit, even where the resultant price exceeded average variable cost. "
1546,18," While not necessary or alone sufficient to support the finding of predatory intent here, it should be noted that MCI produced 
evidence illuminating AT&T's background motives, including statements by AT&T and operating company executives to a 1972 
Florida meeting which stressed the need to prevent the effectuation of construction plans of MCI and other competitors by filing 
matching rates immediately and the need to ""act now rather than wait until they have going business which regulators might not 
permit us to dislodge."" I believe that such evidence is at least probative of a defendant's intent to eliminate a market entrant 
through the use of organizational power and monopoly resources rather than through competition on the merits. "
1548,19," As the Supreme Court has recently emphasized: Our willingness to accept a degree of uncertainty in these cases rests in part on the difficulty of ascertaining business 
damages as compared, for example, to damages resulting from a personal injury or from condemnation of a parcel of land.  
The vagaries of the marketplace usually deny us sure knowledge of what plaintiff's situation would have been in the 
absence of the defendant's antitrust violation.  But our willingness also rests on the principle articulated in cases such as 
Bigelow that it does not ""come with very good grace"" for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific and certain proof of the injury 
which it has itself inflicted. J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442, 101 S. Ct. 1923 (1981) (citations 
omitted).  See Terrell, 494 F.2d at 25 (plaintiff's ""expert on damages need not be armed on the right hand with a slide rule, on 
the left hand with a computer.  He is allowed some economic imagination so long as it does not become fantasy"").  The figures 
within the Study, the testimony of MCI's witnesses, and the arguments of MCI's counsel did not create a delusive impression of 
exactness.  See Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 297 F.2d 906, 912 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 865, 8 
L. Ed. 2d 85, 82 S. Ct. 1031 (1962)."
1548,20," We must be mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition in Zenith, 395 U.S. at 123 : Trial and appellate courts alike must also observe the practical limits of the burden of proof which may be demanded of a 
treble-damage plaintiff who seeks recovery for injuries from a partial or total exclusion from a market; damage issues in 
these cases are rarely susceptible of the kind of concrete, detailed proof of injury which is available in other contexts. "
1549,21," As Instruction 55 stated in pertinent part: The law allows a party injured by conduct which violates the Sherman Act to collect damages even if the evidence does not 
reflect mathematical precision in the calculations of damages.  However, estimates and projections must be grounded on 
assumptions that reflect reasoned judgments based on competent evidence. App. 1206-1207. "
1550,22," AT&T developed two computer models to examine the assumptions and other variables within the Lost Profits Study.  The 
model apparently permitted measurement of at least some changes that would occur as various factors in the Study were 
altered.  AT&T, however, employed the computer models at trial on only two issues, one concerning the revenue rate at which 
MCI would show a loss in 1979, and the other dealing with the level at which a revenue loss would occur had local 
interconnection charges been doubled in prior years. AT&T never argued the availability of the models as a reasonable method 
of achieving disaggregation of damages stemming from lawful and unlawful conduct."
1550,23," The district court structured its instructions and special verdict form so that the jury could determine which of AT&T's allegedly 
improper acts offended the antitrust laws and so comprised the unlawful course of conduct.  The jury cannot be said to have 
rejected the single course of conduct viewpoint simply because it found that five of the fifteen acts did not comprise segments of 
that unlawful conduct.  MCI's contention throughout the trial was that AT&T's unlawful acts in combination -- no matter what 
combination -- caused MCI's harm, and it was that question that the jury decided."
1550,24," As the district court correctly noted: ""What is often crucially important under § 2 is a pattern of conduct rather than one discrete 
activity."" MCI Communications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 462 F. Supp. at 1084. See Federal Prescription Serv., Inc. v. 
American Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 484 F. Supp. 1195, 1208-09 (D.D.C. 1980), rev'd in part on other grounds, 214 U.S. App. D.C. 
76, 663 F.2d 253 (D.C. Cir. 1981). "
1551,25," The defendant offered evidence to exhibit how the damage impact of each act was reasonably calculable.  458 F. Supp. at 
434."
1551,26," The plaintiff's damage proof in that case was also fatally defective because it failed to account for adverse factors other than 
the defendant's unlawfulness.  The defendant's evidence, for example, included a substantial showing of the plaintiff's 
mismanagement, adverse comment on plaintiff in the financial community, competition from other companies, and lawful 
competition from the defendant. The court found that given the plaintiff's failure to explain away the effect of any of those factors, 
any jury verdict rendered upon the unadjusted damage evidence would have been speculative.  458 F. Supp. at 435. Here, 
AT&T made similar claims which were explained away by MCI in a manner sufficient to present a jury question without additional 
adjustment of damage proof."
1551,27," In In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices, the court explicitly found that ""particularization of injury is possible."" 481 F. Supp. at 
1013. The district court in that case, after hearing all the evidence, stated that the plaintiff ""could have done better.  Rather than 
showing a general decline in profits and revenues, the damages proof could have been more closely connected to the individual 
acts complained of."" Id."
1551,28," As the Supreme Court stated in reference to proof of antitrust damages: Any other rule would enable the wrongdoer to profit by his wrongdoing at the expense of his victim.  It would be an 
inducement to make wrongdoing so effective and complete in every case as to preclude any recovery by rendering the 
measure of damages uncertain. . . . The most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of uncertainty 
which his wrong has created. Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 264-65, 90 L. Ed. 652, 66 S. Ct. 574 (1946). "
1552,29," The majority asserts that the figure ""lacks a foundation"" in part because the author of the Study failed to provide evidence of 
its validity or reasonableness.  Supra at 1165.  Yet the author, Mr. Uhl, testified that he arrived at it through his assessment of 
market conditions in light of his long-term study of this area of business and listed a number of detailed factors which informed 
that assessment. Tr. 3330, 3334-5.  For the majority to now hold this testimony insufficient is to again usurp the role of the jury in 
weighing credible and substantiated evidence.  The majority also faults MCI for not calling as a witness a consultant who had 
viewed Mr. Uhl's figure and had concurred as to its reasonableness.  Yet, since the author was the actual source of the adjusted 
figure, the fact that another expert later approved of the figures does not mean the second expert must be called to lay a proper 
foundation for the study.  In addition, it should be noted that the district court gave AT&T the option to call the consultant to 
testify, and that AT&T declined to do so after deposing him during a trial recess. "
1554,30," Moreover, at trial AT&T attempted to demonstrate that the $ .50 figure given by MCI was too low, and thus not appropriate in 
considering whether Telpak was predatorily priced.  The jury may have believed AT&T's evidence on that score because it found 
Telpak not to be priced at a predatory level.  If the jury found that AT&T's Telpak revenues were much higher than MCI claimed, 
this would be consistent with the finding that MCI could compete for those customers at the $ .85 level. "

""Coastal."" "
1594,6," One notice entitled ""ANNOUNCEMENT BY NELSON BUNKER HUNT"" was sent to hundreds of crude oil users.  The 
concluding paragraph of this document stated: The attention of all those who may be concerned with these developments, whether as purchasers or sellers of oil, oil 
products, or otherwise, is drawn to the continuance of Hunt's rights.  It is Hunt's intention to assert those rights wherever 
and whenever necessary against those who would infringe them, including anyone dealing in or with oil extracted from the 
Sarir Field, its products or proceeds. This warning applies equally to dealings in or with so-called ""royalty oil"" or ""cost crude 
oil"" of which there is none.  Legal title to all oil from Sarir Field and Concession 65 rests in BP Exploration Company (Libya) 
Ltd. and Nelson Bunker Hunt."

carrying Sarir crude. The Hunts claim that she may have been."
1594,9," At least, the Hunts' ostensible purpose in communicating with the oil users was to notify them of the title dispute.  Coastal 
contends that the communications were intended mainly to intimidate its potential customers. This dispute is addressed in more 
detail in section II(E), infra. "
1595,10," The suit was originally filed against the Hunts, British Petroleum Company Ltd. and its subsidiary, BP Exploration Company 
(Libya) Ltd.  The district court granted the motion to dismiss filed by British Petroleum and BP Exploration on the ground that the 
court lacked jurisdiction over them."
1595,11," The Hunts' motivation in dismissing these suits is disputed.  Nelson Bunker Hunt testified that the litigation was dismissed only 
after foreign counsel advised that, considering the political climate prevailing during the OPEC oil embargo, the likelihood of 
prevailing in the suits was minimal.  Coastal argues that the suits were dismissed after the Hunts' settlement with Libya because 
the litigation was never intended to be more than a means of pressuring Libya."

1595,13," Included in a longer joint pretrial stipulation, the pertinent portions were as follows:"
1595,17," .  Shortly after December 7, 1971, BP instituted an investigation the object of which was to identify persons and entities who 
might be dealing in, or interested in dealing in, Sarir crude or its products.  The purpose of such investigation was to assist BP in 
contacting such persons or entities to give notice of BP's claim to ownership to Sarir crude, and to assist BP in filing and 
prosecuting litigation. Such investigation continued until sometime in 1974."
1595,*, * *
1595,21," .  After December 7, 1971, BP Exploration Company (Libya) Limited filed 29 lawsuits in various parts of the world.  The

1596,33," .  After June 11, 1973, Nelson Bunker Hunt, acting for himself and his two brothers, filed 21 lawsuits in various parts of the 
world.  All such suits were filed jointly with the BP Exploration Company (Libya) Limited.  The object of each such lawsuit was an 
attempt to establish ownership of Sarir crude and its products after the expropriation or nationalization."
1596,14,"  Q: Isn't it true, sir, that in making such warnings or threats it was your purpose to prevent people from dealing in Sarir crude 
or products refined from Sarir crude? A: No, not -- partially, I guess you would say.  Actually we were requested by the State Department to do it, and they were 
anxious to protect the validity of these contracts and so that had something to do with it, with our actions."
1596,15,"  Q: Isn't it true, Mr. Hunt, that whatever Bunker Hunt and the legal counsel did, with your general authority, was done to 
further your desire that nobody buy oil, Sarir oil, from Libya, and nobody be able to buy oil or buy products refined from 
Sarir oil? A: Without our being compensated?  Certainly.  We are not interested in seeing our oil sold without our being compensated, 
as our contract called for, and that was our purpose, that and to protect our interest, whatever it might be under the then 
shaky circumstances of the Libyan government at that time."
1596,16," Noerr involved a suit by a group of trucking companies against a group of railroads for conspiracy to restrain trade and 
monopolize the long-distance freight business.  The trucking companies charged that the railroads had, through a third party, 
conducted a publicity campaign designed to foster the adoption of legislation unfavorable to the truckers and to injure the 
truckers' public reputations and customer relations.  Noting the ""essential dissimilarity"" between this conduct and that "

those activities comprised mere solicitation of governmental action with respect to the passage and enforcement of laws."" 365 
U.S. at 138, 81 S. Ct. at 530, 5 L. Ed. 2d at 471. Although the Court did not mention it, there is support in the legislative history of the Sherman Act for the Noerr decision.  
Senator Sherman stated during debate that the Act ""does not interfere in the slightest degree with voluntary associations made 
to affect the public opinion to advance the interests of a particular trade or association."" 21 Cong.Rec. 2562 (1890). See

U.S. at 132 n. 6, 81 S. Ct. at 526-27 n. 6, 5 L. Ed. 2d at 468 n. 6."
1598,23,"  We conclude that it would be destructive of rights of association and petition to hold that groups with common interests may 
not, without violating the antitrust laws, use the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts to 
advocate their causes and points of view respecting resolution of their business and economic interests vis-a-vis their

Corporate Payments Abroad: An Antitrust Approach, 86 Yale L.J. 215, 290 (1976). Other commentators acknowledge the 
difficulty of applying petitioning immunity to foreign communications as a constitutional matter but advocate its extension for 
other reasons.  See B. Hawk, Common Market and International Antitrust: A Comparative Analysis 144-48 (1979) (consistency 
with act-of-state doctrine; needs of American firms overseas); Fugate, The Department of Justice's Antitrust Guide for

25, at 132 (international comity and good foreign relations). "
1600,28," Other cases that have involved foreign petitions are of little further assistance. In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. 
Co., 513 F. Supp. 1100, 1155-57 (E.D.Pa.1981), the court ruled that petitioning immunity protected the defendants from antitrust 
liability for joint solicitation of the Japanese and United States Governments.  The court, however, did not discuss the 
extraterritorial application of petitioning immunity. Similarly, in United States v. Amax, 1977 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 61,467 (N.D.Ill.), 
the court held that petitioning immunity did not bar an antitrust suit for conduct undertaken with the approval of the Canadian 
Government.  That ruling appears to be based on the fact that the Canadians were not petitioned; instead, they merely 
expressed approval.  The court, however, did not discuss the extent to which petitioning immunity applied.  In Platt Saco Lowell 
Ltd. v. Spindelfabrik Suessen-Schurr, 1978-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 61,898 (N.D.Ill.1977), the court seemed to apply petitioning 
immunity to German litigation.  It did not, however, discuss the issue."
1600,29," Professor Areeda once took the position that petitioning immunity extended only to efforts to influence ""democratic"" 
governments.  P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis para. 192, at 130 (2d ed. 1974).  His most recent writings on the subject, however, 
criticize the Occidental Petroleum decision on this precise ground: ""the court [in Occidental] seems wrong, however, because 
every government, whether representative or not, is privileged to set the terms on which persons within its borders may seek its 
legislation, decrees, or other sovereign action."" 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 239, at 174-75 (1978)."

(6th Cir.1979). Alexander v. National Farmers Org., 687 F.2d 1173, 1200 (8th Cir.1982), is not contrary to our holding.  While the court there 
found certain threats of litigation unprotected, it did so only because it found that the litigation was a ""sham."" The court expressly 
distinguished ""circumstances in which actions against a competitor's customers are in good faith."" Id. at 1200. We decline to follow Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Resources, Inc., 460 F. Supp. 1359, 1386 (D.Haw.1978), to the extent that it 
holds threats of litigation directed to a competitor's customers to be per se unprotected. There is no precedent for that decision. "
1601,31," Mid-Texas Communications Sys. v. AT&T, 615 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 286, 66 L. Ed. 2d 
140 (1980), cited by Coastal on this point, is simply inapposite.  In that case AT&T refused to interconnect a competitor's 
telephone exchanges and claimed the immunity on the ground that its refusal to act was a necessary first step to bringing the 
dispute to a government agency.  The court held that this was not directed toward any government agency and was not an 
attempt to influence government action.  Here, on the contrary, the Hunts did invoke governmental judicial aid.  The question is 
whether the declaration that they would do so and the publicity initiated by them were ancillary to that petition."
1601,32," We also reject Coastal's contention that the Hunts' notices claiming title to Sarir crude were unprotected because they were 
misleading.  Again, the argument was not raised below as defeating the application of petitioning immunity. See discussion at 
slip op. p 1811, supra.  Moreover, the publicity makes clear that it states only the Hunts' claims concerning the Sarir crude. We, 
therefore, reject Coastal's argument that the publicity is misleading because it states without qualification that the Hunts had title 
to the oil."
1601,33," In Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 635 n. 6, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 2889 n. 6, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009, 1019 n.6 (1977), the 
Court stated that California Motor and Otter Tail together ""may be cited for the proposition that repetitive sham litigation . . . may 
constitute an antitrust violation."""
1601,34, See supra note 13. 
1602,35," Accord Sherman v. United States, 462 F.2d 577, 579 (5th Cir.1972); Henry v. Commissioner, 362 F.2d 640, 643 (5th 
Cir.1966)."
1602,36," Accord Donovan v. Hamm's Drive Inn, 661 F.2d 316, 317 (5th Cir. 1981); Loftin & Woodard v. United States, 577 F.2d 1206, 
1232 (5th Cir. 1978); Associated Beverages Co. v. P. Ballantine & Sons, 287 F.2d 261, 263 (5th Cir.1961). Coastal's reliance on 
Wallin v. Fuller, 476 F.2d 1204, 1209-10 (5th Cir.1973), is misplaced.  Wallin involved the modification of a pretrial order to 
reflect an issue that the parties had, by implication, consented to try.  The Hunts cannot be said to have consented to trying the 
issue of intent in this case.  Throughout the trial, the Hunts argued that the stipulations were dispositive of the petitioning 
immunity issue.  The fact that they did not rely solely upon the stipulations after the district court denied their motions for 
summary judgment does not constitute implied consent. "
1603,37," There was some evidence from which a jury might have inferred bad faith on the Hunts' part.  The number of lawsuits filed 
without success is itself circumstantial evidence of sham. See Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mtn. Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 690 
F.2d 1240, 1257 (9th Cir.1982). So is the fact that the suits were dismissed after the Hunts settled with Libya.  See Alexander v. 
National Farmers Org., 687 F.2d 1173, 1202 (8th Cir.1982). In addition there were the two Schuler memoranda, the conduct of 
BP, and the Hunts' testimony.  Nevertheless, after reviewing this evidence along with the entire record we are unconvinced that 
the showing of sham was so substantial as to require a finding that the district court abused its discretion. We do not, of course, hold that absent the stipulations the evidence would have been insufficient to present a jury question as to 
sham. In light of our view that the stipulations preclude a finding of sham, we need not reach that question."
1603,38," In ""Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment,"" filed Sept. 28, 1978, for example, 
Coastal's main argument was that petitioning immunity simply did not apply to the per se violation alleged in this case.  In three 
conclusory sentences, Coastal asserted the sham exception as an alternative argument.  Coastal vigorously opposed the Hunts' 
motion for a hearing to determine the validity of the nationalization of the Sarir under Libyan and international law.  Coastal 
argued that this law was irrelevant because the Hunts could not assert a defense based upon a good-faith belief that they had 
title to the oil. See ""Further Response of Coast States Gas Producing Company and Coastal States Marketing, Inc. to 
Defendants' Motion to Determine Foreign Law,"" filed June 5, 1979, and ""Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Request for a 
Hearing to Determine Foreign and International Law,"" filed November 21, 1980. On December 1, 1980, Coastal filed a memorandum in opposition to the Hunts' renewed motion for summary judgment. The 
document stated that ""The Sherman Act regulates market and price behavior without regard to the purpose or intent of those 
tampering with them."" The sham argument is, somewhat inconsistently, asserted as an alternative argument.  On February 18, 
1981, Coastal's motion in limine asked that the Hunts be ordered not to introduce evidence showing (1) that the nationalization 
of the Sarir was invalid; (2) the Hunts' belief that they had title to the oil; or (3) foreign or international law with respect to title to 
the crude oil. The motion stated ""if the Hunt brothers' action violated the antitrust laws of the United States, those actions cannot 
be justified by good motive . . ."""
1603,39," Thus, in a brief filed March 3, 1981, concerning the admissibility of evidence of the Texas litigation, Coastal argued that it did 
not have to show sham but only that the suits were filed in furtherance of a conspiracy to restrain trade.  Similarly, in Coastal's 
""Plaintiff's Objections to Defendants' Jury Instructions and Requested Interrogatories,"" filed March 12, 1981, its position was: ""In 
sum, the Plaintiffs in this case have no burden to show that lawsuits initiated by the Defendants were without probable cause or 
were filed with a total disregard of the merits.  Plaintiffs need only show (1) that the Defendants had an ulterior purpose in filing 
lawsuits and (2) other activities of the Defendants, apart from those incidental to the lawsuits themselves, support the claim of 
abuse of process."" In their memorandum resisting the Hunts' motion for a directed verdict, filed March 13, 1981, Coastal stated 
that ""all that the plaintiffs must show is that the lawsuits were filed for an ulterior purpose of restraining trade in Sarir oil and that 
they have committed other acts, apart from those incidental to the lawsuits themselves."" "
1604,40," The pretrial order listed as a contested issue of fact whether the Hunts' actions were a sham, presumably reflecting the fact 
that the sham exception had been formally asserted as an alternative argument.  This reference to the exception does not 
convince us that the district court incorrectly perceived Coastal's main theories at trial any more than do the summary assertions 
of the sham exception in the pleadings."
1604,41," It is not entirely clear that Coastal disputes this fact even on appeal.  Coastal's brief asserts only that the evidence below 
reasonably supported a finding that ""the principal purpose of any litigation filed in the United States was to discourage the 
marketing of Sarir crude . . ."" (emphasis added).  Coastal thus seems to claim only that anticompetitive motives predominated.  
Such a finding would not preclude a finding that the Hunts genuinely desired judicial relief."
1604,42," We use the ""sham exception"" in this opinion to refer to the exception to petitioning immunity arising from a lack of a significant 
intent to influence the government.  There are other exceptions to petitioning immunity, also referred to as ""sham"" exceptions, 
which are not relevant here. This is not, for example, an ""overall scheme"" case.  This exception to petitioning immunity dates at least from Kobe, Inc. v. 
Dempsey Pump Co., 198 F.2d 416 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 837, 73 S. Ct. 46, 97 L. Ed. 651 (1952). The theory of 
these cases is that good faith, even successful, litigation brought in furtherance of an ""overall scheme"" to violate the antitrust 
laws is not entitled to immunity. Each of the cases applying the ""overall scheme"" theory involved circumstances unlawful even apart from the litigation.  Thus, in 
Kobe and Dairy Foods Inc. v. Dairy Maid Prods. Corp., 297 F.2d 805 (7th Cir.1961), the litigation was brought against infringers 
of unlawfully pooled patents. Other cases involved unlawful patent licensing agreements, United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 
U.S. 174, 83 S. Ct. 1773, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823 (1963); Clapper v. Original Tractor Cab Co., 270 F.2d 616 (7th Cir.1959), cert. 
denied, 361 U.S. 967, 4 L. Ed. 2d 547, 80 S. Ct. 588 (1960). In one case challenges to tariffs were made in an effort to maintain 
a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate the relevant market among the conspirators, Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mtn. Motor Tariff 
Bur., 690 F.2d 1240, 1263-65 (9th Cir.1982). In another, litigation was used to maintain an unlawful tying arrangement.  Rex 
Chainbelt, Inc. v. Harco Prods., Inc., 512 F.2d 993 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 831, 96 S. Ct. 52, 46 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1975). Overall scheme may have been one of the theories Coastal proceeded upon in the court below. It is not, however, urged on 
appeal.  Moreover, there is no record evidence supporting the existence of any overall scheme to restrain trade apart from the 
litigation and related conduct. Thus, the case does not present us with the necessity of considering the ""overall scheme"" 
exception.  Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 994 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025, 100 S. Ct. 688, 62 L. 
Ed. 2d 659 (1980). Nor is this a Walker Process-type sham case.  In Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 
86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965), the Court held that petitioning immunity is lost when a party bringing anticompetitive 
litigation is involved in unethical conduct such as fraud, bribery, misrepresentation or perjury.  Coastal has never urged this 
theory on appeal or to the district court. "
1605,43," At least one commentator has urged a similar ""primary purpose"" motivation standard.  See Bien, Litigation as an Antitrust 
Violation: Conflict Between the First Amendment and the Sherman Act, 16 U.San.Fran.L.Rev. 41, 92 (1981)."
1605,44," See also Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mtn. Motor Tariff Bur., Inc., 690 F.2d 1240, 1254 (9th Cir.1982) (""Genuine efforts to 
induce governmental action are shielded by Noerr even if their express and sole purpose is to stifle or eliminate competition.""); 
Forro Precision, Inc. v. IBM, 673 F.2d 1045, 1060-61 (9th Cir.1982) (sham exception applies when petition ""is undertaken for 
purely anti-competitive reasons""); Hydro-Tech Corp. v. Sundstrand Corp., 673 F.2d 1171, 1175 (10th Cir.1982) (sham exception 
applicable when suit is ""nothing more"" than attempt to interfere with business relationships of competitor); Landmarks Holding 
Corp. v. Bermant, 664 F.2d 891, 896-97 (2d Cir.1981) (sham exception applicable if litigation brought ""solely to harass and 
hinder a competitor""). In Associated Radio Serv. Co. v. Page Airways, Inc., 624 F.2d 1342, 1358 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 
450 U.S. 1030, 101 S. Ct. 1740-41, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981), we held a complaint within the sham exception which alleged that 
the suit was brought ""not for a proper purpose but for the purpose of achieving an unlawful objective."" Id. at 1358 (emphasis 
added)."
1605,45," The standard we articulate is similar to the initial burden of proof faced by a public employee seeking to show that he was 
discharged because of constitutionally protected conduct.  The employee must show that his conduct was protected and that it 
played a ""substantial"" part in the employer's decision to discharge him.  See Givhan v. Western Line Cons. School Dist., 439 
U.S. 410, 416, 99 S. Ct. 693, 697, 58 L. Ed. 2d 619, 625 (1979); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 285, 97 S. 
Ct. 568, 576, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471, 482 (1977). The same standard applies in some fourteenth amendment cases.  See Village of 
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977). Of course, a 
showing that the defendant was ""substantially"" motivated by impermissible factors is only the beginning of these cases.  The 
burden then shifts to the defendant.  HN13[
] In petitioning immunity cases, showing to the satisfaction of the trier of fact that 
the defendant's conduct was ""substantially"" motivated by a hope of judicial relief will, absent evidence of sham, end the case.  
Nothing more is required to bring the case within the immunity. "
1606,46," There is one procedural irregularity that complicates our assessment of the insufficiency of Coastal's evidence.  In the normal 
case, the defendant would have the burden of producing evidence demonstrating that its conduct fell within the scope of 
petitioning immunity. Only after such a showing would the burden shift back to the plaintiff to show sham. Therefore, since the 
district court directed a verdict in this case before the Hunts' case-in-chief, Coastal's burden to demonstrate sham had not yet 
technically been activated. We are convinced, however, that Coastal was not prejudiced by the procedure followed by the district court.  There is no 
question that the issue of sham was joined in the plaintiffs' case-in-chief.  Indeed, plaintiffs argue vigorously on appeal that the 
issue of the Hunts' intent was extensively addressed during their case. Moreover, Coastal has never asserted that there is 
additional evidence of sham it was unable to introduce. While we think the better course is to reach the issue of sham only after the defendant has made a prima facie showing that its 
conduct falls within the protection of petitioning immunity, we are confident that the issue was fully presented in this case."
1606,47," Because of the views we take on the issues addressed above, we need not reach the Hunts' additional arguments that 
Coastal is estopped from claiming sham and that their own conduct, even if unprotected, did not constitute an unreasonable 
restraint of trade in Sarir crude."
1606,48, See supra note 7.
1606,49," HN16[
] ""The . . . judicial proceedings of any court of any such state . . . shall have the full faith and credit in every court 
within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state."" "
1610,1," At the hearing on the request for preliminary injunction, the appellees' former attorney testified that the appellees 
acknowledged that appellants had a patent pending on the formulas and agreed that the formulas were secret. "
1624,1," In Schwinn, the Court examined territorial and customer restrictions placed on two types of distributors of bicycles.  Under the 
first distribution system, the distributors acted as wholesalers and bought and resold the Schwinn bicycles.  Under the second 
system, Schwinn retained title to the bicycles and the distributors solicited orders."
1624,2," The Court held that the restrictions imposed on the first set of distributors constituted a per se violation of Sherman 1.  388 U.S. 
379, 87 S. Ct. at 1865. Presumably relying on Simpson, in regard to the second distribution method the Court held that: (where) the manufacturer retains title, dominion, and risk with respect to the product and the position and function of the 
dealer in question are, in fact, indistinguishable from those of an agent or salesman of the manufacturer, it is only if the 
impact of the confinement is ""unreasonably"" restrictive of competition that a violation of § 1 results from such confinement, 
unencumbered by culpable price fixing. 388 U.S. at 380, 87 S. Ct. at 1866. The Schwinn Court found that the territorial and customer restrictions were reasonable and cited as the critical facts: (1) that 
other bicycles reasonably interchangeable with the Schwinn bicycles were available in the market place; (2) that Schwinn 
distributors were permitted to deal in the products of Schwinn's competitors; (3) that the restraints were not ""intermixed"" with 
price fixing; and (4) that competition made the challenged program necessary.  388 U.S. 381-82, 87 S. Ct. at 1866-1867."
1624,3," There is an obvious inconsistency between Simpson and Schwinn.  The import of Simpson is that absent the indicia of an 
entrepreneur a manufacturer may validly place restrictions on the sale of his products.  Schwinn, on the other hand, asserts that 
such restraints, in the absence of price fixing, would be tested under the rule of reason.  Yet, it is difficult to imagine a greater 
""intermixing"" of price fixing than the direct price restraints imposed in Simpson. "
1626,4," The scope of Section 3 is limited to tangible goods and does not include services.  See Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 
F.2d 1207, 1214 (9th Cir.1977). Considering that plaintiff's claims concern, for the most part, services (the right to solicit orders 
for Brandt equipment and the right to perform Brandt authorized service work), Section 3 is of limited applicability to plaintiff's 
case. "
1627,5," Beyond bare allegations, Gordon has failed to come forward with evidence establishing the existence of the other three tying 
elements.  For example, no evidence was introduced suggesting repair parts for Brandt equipment were available from sources 
other than Brandt.  If Brandt were the only source of repair parts, that would directly undercut any allegation of coercion."
1627,6," As discussed earlier, Section 3 of HN13[
] the Clayton Act is inapplicable to plaintiff's claims of exclusive dealings in services.  
Even if applicable, plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of proof.  Gordon has made no showing as to what impact the 
restrictions have on the relevant market for the sale and service of money processing equipment. See Tampa Electric Co. v. 
Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 329, 81 S. Ct. 623, 629, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961) (discussing the factors necessary for a 
showing that a restraint could result in a substantial lessening of competition). "
1628,7," It is unclear whether Gordon has alleged that used and reconditioned money processing equipment constitute distinct 
submarkets from new money processing equipment. If such a claim was made, it must be rejected.  The evidence established, 
and plaintiff concedes in the pretrial order, that reconditioned and used money processing equipment are suitable substitutes for 
and compete with new money processing equipment."
1628,8," Neither party effectively demonstrated the scope of the relevant geographic market.  What the evidence did show was that 
plaintiff would rarely service equipment outside the States of Oregon and Washington even though there was no territorial 
restriction placed on his service business. Moreover, there was no evidence proffered indicating that plaintiff could somehow 
solicit sales for equipment on a national level. "
1629,9," Plaintiff offered no evidence supporting his allegation that Brandt monopolized the service industry.  Instead, his argument was 
predicated on a finding that Brandt monopolized the sale of money processing equipment and therefore must have monopolized 
the service industry.  The argument is, however, unfounded.  Nothing has been demonstrated which would suggest that Brandt 
could employ its monopoly in one market, even if it had one, to obtain a monopoly in another market.  Absent proof of monopoly 
power, Gordon's claim is rejected. "
1630,10," The Court rejects plaintiff's assertion that Brandt instituted a discriminatory credit policy once he was terminated as a district 
manager. As soon as Brandt was assured of plaintiff's credit, Gordon received his old credit terms."
1630,11," Even if Brandt had monopoly power, not every refusal to deal would violate the antitrust laws. HN22[
] As a general rule, a 
company has a right to deal with whomever it chooses.  Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 14-15, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 
1421-1422, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945). Section 2 prohibits only those refusals to deal which under the particular circumstances of the 
case are unreasonably anticompetitive.  Mid-Texas Communications Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 615 F.2d 1372, 
1389 (6th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 286, 66 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1980). Plaintiff has not demonstrated 
Brandt's intent to monopolize, see United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 L. Ed. 992 (1919) (discussing 
the intent test), nor that Brandt controls a scarce resource which it is not feasible for excluded competitors to duplicate (and 
therefore must give competitors access to the resource on a reasonable, non-discriminatory basis).  See United States v. 
Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 810 (1912) (example of a ""bottle-neck"" 
monopoly).  See generally Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d 843 (6th Cir.1979). The Court has already determined 
that the particular refusals to deal are not violative of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."
1630,12," Brandt has not and will not enforce the covenant not to compete.  Plaintiff has therefore not been damaged by it.  Moreover, 
covenants not to compete, if limited in time and scope and if ancillary to the entire contract, are reasonable restrictions.  See 
American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 (2nd Cir.1975)."
1630,13," Although Gordon contends that he will not be able to compete in the service industry without Brandt's repair manuals, the 
evidence is to the contrary.  Other district managers have been terminated by Brandt and remain in competition with Brandt.  
Moreover, the relevant product market includes equipment other than Brandt equipment. "
1631,14," Plaintiff realleges his actual monopolization claims in support of his attempt to monopolize claim.  Under its § 1 analysis, the 
Court has found it permissible to require plaintiff to refrain from dealing in used equipment and equipment for resale, to stay in a 
specific territory, and to repair only Brandt equipment.  Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Brandt's refusal to provide him with 
the service manuals or favorable credit terms has adversely impacted competition.  Finally, given the total absence of proof of 
market power and the uncertainty in the proof of the relevant market, plaintiff's failure to prove predatory conduct or a per se 
violation of § 1 precludes his attempt to monopolize claim.  See M.A.P. Co., Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 691 F.2d 1303 (9th Cir.1982); 
Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381 (9th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1979). "
1632,15," Plaintiff was not without means of proving his damages.  He could have offered evidence as to what similarly situated 
salespeople have made in markets free of anticompetitive restraints."
1632,16," The Act requires the franchisor to provide notice of his intent to terminate and to purchase the franchisee's stock in trade.  
RCW § 19.100.180(j)."
1632,17," There is no evidence that plaintiff did not pay fair market value for the items he was required to purchase from Brandt (repair 
parts, service instructions, etc.).  Such payments are exempted from the definition of a franchise fee. See Chisom, State 
Regulation of Franchising: The Washington Experience, 48 Wash.L.Rev. 291, 342 (1974). See generally American Oil Co. v. 
Columbia Oil Co., Inc., 88 Wash.2d 835, 841, 567 P.2d 637 (1977) (approving the Chisom definition). "
1633,18," The distinction is between a condition and bargained for consideration.  HN29[
] A condition creates no right or duty in itself.  
See United States v. Schaeffer, 319 F.2d 907 (9th Cir.1963). A condition ""is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, 
unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due."" Restatement (Second) of 
Contracts, § 224.  Consideration, on the other hand, is something actually bargained for and given in exchange.  See 
Huberdeau v. Desmarais, 79 Wash.2d 432, 486 P.2d 1074 (1971). Whether a provision in a contract is a condition, the 
nonfulfillment of which results in a forfeiture, or bargained for consideration, the breach of which results in a right to damages, 
depends on the intent of the parties as manifested in their agreement.  See Ross v. Harding, 64 Wash.2d 231, 236, 391 P.2d 
526 (1964). HN30[
] Conditions are not favored by the courts, Fischler v. Nicklin, 51 Wash. 2d 518, 523, 319 P.2d 1098 (1958), and if any doubt exists, the term should be construed as consideration.  See Prager's, Inc. v. Bullitt Co., 1 Wash.App. 575, 584, 
463 P.2d 217 (1969). "
1645,1," Plaintiff relies on Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 601 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1979), for the proposition that ""even-handed efforts"" are 
adequate to meet a ""best efforts"" provision of a contract.  To the contrary, the Court in Bloor, supra at 614, stated: While the [contract clause] clearly required Falstaff to treat the Ballantine brands as well as its own, it does not follow that it 
required no more . . . . [It] imposed an added obligation to use ""best efforts to promote and maintain a high volume of sales"" 
. . . . Plaintiff was not obligated to show just what steps Falstaff could reasonably have taken to maintain a high volume for 
Ballantine products.  It was sufficient that Falstaff simply didn't care about Ballentine's volume and was content to allow this 
to plummet so long as that course was best for Falstaff's overall profit [and distribution] picture, an inference which the 
judge permissibly drew. Bloor clearly contradicts plaintiff's argument that even efforts are best efforts."
1645,2," Plaintiff contends that Joyce has been successfully able to promote Seven-Up and Royal Crown colas at the same time and 
that it will thus be able to promote LIKE and Royal Crown at the same time.  This argument has no merit.  The testimony 
demonstrates that the industry practice for promoting colas is to promote one cola at a time because colas constitute a distinct 
segment of the soft drink market.  Thus, it is feasible to promote Royal Crown and Seven-Up simultaneously, but not to promote 
Royal Crown's colas and LIKE simultaneously."
1645,3," See U.C.C. § 1-205 (1964).  (HN2[
] An applicable usage of trade in the place where any part of performance is to occur shall be used in interpreting the agreement as to that part of the performance.); U.C.C. § 2-202.  See also Schubtex, Inc. v. Allen "

supplement the express terms of a contract for the sale of goods)."
1646,4," See American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230, 1250 (3d Cir. 1975). At any event, HN4[
] the Section 1 
rule of reason test is not violated by the contract provision in question as the exclusivity requirement encourages rather than 
forecloses competition."

(1949). In addition to evaluating the foreclosure of competition, it is necessary to consider the economic justification for the 
challenged clause.  Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir.), cert. granted, 379 U.S. 885, 85 S. Ct. 158, 13 L. Ed. 2d 91

where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States . . . and where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination. . . . """
1653,3," Plaintiff contends that business machine cores are the relevant product market.  Sonoco claims that Double H has vacillated in 
its definition of the relevant product because at one point it included cores other than business machine cores.  No prejudice 
appears to have been suffered by Sonoco.  Sonoco has not even presented evidence that the inclusion of other cores would be 
proper.  We therefore accept business machine cores as the relevant product. "
1654,4, Fiber cores are cardboard or paper cores.
