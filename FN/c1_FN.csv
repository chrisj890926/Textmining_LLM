judgment."

24,4," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce . . . is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
24,5," Section 4 of the Clayton Act is a remedial provision that makes available treble damages to ""any person who shall be injured in 
his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 is an equitable 
provision that provides for injunctions ""against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26."
24,6," Under the so-called ""per se"" antitrust doctrine, certain categories of business practices are deemed to be so blatantly 
anticompetitive that it would be inefficient and unwise for courts to examine the effects of such practices in particular cases 
under the alternative ""rule of reason"" analysis. E.g., Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 
2d 545 (1958). Practices which have been held to be per se unlawful include price fixing, see, e.g., United States v. Trenton 
Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397, 47 S. Ct. 377, 71 L. Ed. 700 (1927), and group boycotts, or concerted refusals to deal, see, 
e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 211-12, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). "
25,7," While the scope of the Brunswick decision was limited to cases for treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, Cargill 
extended the application of the antitrust injury requirement to equity actions under section 16. "
26,8," Belcher attempts to distinguish Atlantic Richfield on the ground that it concerned a claim of a vertical maximum price fixing 
conspiracy, whereas the instant case concerns an alleged horizontal maximum price fixing scheme. This distinction is irrelevant 
to the question of antitrust injury. Atlantic Richfield clearly states that ""in the context of pricing practices, only predatory pricing 
has the requisite anticompetitive effect."" 495 U.S. at    , 110 S. Ct. at 1892, 109 L. Ed. 2d at 347. "
31,1," Local Rule 1.051E of the Eastern District of Louisiana provides: In order to promote judicial economy and conserve judicial resources, and to avoid the potential for forum shopping and 
conflicting Court rulings, all [collateral proceedings and refiled cases] shall be transferred to the section to which the matter 
having the lowest docket number has been allotted. . . . "
32,2," Dibidale's reliance on section 1972(1)(D) renders irrelevant the banks' claims that it failed to present evidence of an unusual 
banking practice that falls within the purview of section 1972. The unusual banking practice element is a requirement only of 
complaints lodged under section 1972(1)(C), in which a bank imposes the condition or requirement ""that the customer provide 
some additional credit, property, or service to such bank [the bank providing the loan], other than those related to and usually 
provided in connection with a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service. . . ."" "
33,3," According to Senator Edward Brooke, the premise underlying the bank anti-tying provision was ""'a disturbing trend in the past 
year toward erosion of the traditional separation of powers between the suppliers of money -- the banks -- and the users of 
money -- commerce and industry.'"" 1970 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 5557. (Supplementary Views of Senator Brooke 
(quoting statement of then-President Richard Nixon).) "
34,4," The banks' contention that the parol evidence rule precludes Dibidale from raising these allegations in light of language in the 
loan agreement stating that Dibidale hired Theriot of its own free will is without merit. The terms of the loan agreement 
notwithstanding, the relevant issue is whether Dibidale has provided sufficient evidence that its hiring of Theriot was a condition 
or requirement of the loan so as to survive the banks' motion for summary judgment. "
35,5," Dibidale further asserts that Popich's deposition testimony must be read in light of the fact that immediately after Popich made 
the quoted statement the deposition was recessed for a time to pursue settlement negotiations. "
36,1," The precise statutory language encompasses tying, exclusive dealing and reciprocity arrangements related to the extension of 
credit, leasing or selling of property, furnishing of services, or fixing or varying the consideration for these activities. My 
discussion applies to all of the act's coverage, but I refer to extension of credit throughout this discussion as a shorthand 
reference to the whole."
36,2," The plain meaning of § 1972(1) was clear enough to the Third Circuit which, in ruling against a bank customer's claim under § 
1972(1)(C), held: ""There is no evidence that Tose's ouster in favor of Barness was made a 'condition or requirement' of a loan to 
the Eagles or to Tose. Appellants allege only that Tose's ouster in favor of Barness was the hidden agenda behind the 
conspiracy charged in count one. This does not satisfy the 'condition or requirement' element of § 1972(1)(C)."" Tose v. First 
Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., 648 F.2d 879, 897 (3d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 893, 102 S. Ct. 390, 70 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1981). "

First Federal Sav. and Loan Assoc., 837 F.2d 712, 715-16 (5th Cir.1988); Tic-X-Press, Inc. v. Omni Promotions Co., 815 F.2d

38,4," The majority opinion states that Senator Bennett's purpose was to exclude merely simultaneous banking transactions from the 
scope of § 1972(1). Their quotation from his statement in the Congressional Record goes on to say that, ""The bill as amended 
would require that a condition or requirement imposed by the bank must be demonstrated in order to prove that a violation has 
occurred."" Conf.Rep. (emphasis added) At the very least, this language does not comment on the degree of coercion required 
beyond non-simultaneity. More likely, it emphasizes that the bank must impose a violative tying arrangement on the customer."

49,3," In so holding, the district court cited to, and quoted extensively from, the portion of the Third Circuit's opinion in Weiss that held 
that a hospital could not conspire with its medical staff since they were not competitors. However, the court did not discuss the 
portion of the Weiss opinion in which the court of appeals held that the individual members of a hospital's medical staff could 
conspire with each other when making a staff privileges recommendation. "
50,4," This position is not inconsistent with reported opinions of this court. In Potters, the court found only that the intracorporate 
conspiracy doctrine prevented a finding that a hospital conspired with a member of its medical staff. 800 F.2d at 573. In Smith, 
the court held that there could be no conspiracy among a number of physicians operating in a group practice. The court 
emphasized that the physicians were not independent practitioners competing among themselves but were members of a 
professional corporation operating toward one economic goal.  703 F.2d at 950-51. "
56,1," This standard places a lighter burden on the FTC than that imposed by the traditional equity standard for issuance of a 
preliminary injunction. The FTC does not have to show the traditional equity standards of irreparable injury, probability of 
success on the merits, and that the balance of equities favors the petitioners. FTC v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 665 F.2d 1072, 1081-
82 (D.C. Cir. 1981)."
56,2," The stipulation, signed on October 17, 1990, and filed on October 19, 1990, provides, in part:"
56,1," . For the purposes of determining the motion for preliminary injunction under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act, it is stipulated that plaintiff has offered an adequate prima facie case on all relevant issues except the affirmative defense of 
failing company, and that defendants will not contest that such prima facie showing meets that standards under 13(b) for issuing 
a preliminary injunction except for the issue of the failing company defense."
56,2," . The failing company defense is the only legal and factual matter at issue in this proceeding, and defendants bear the burden 
of proof on that issue. "
57,3," HN4[
] In order to determine an acquisition's likely impact on competition, a Court looks to the relevant product market, 
geographic market, and the transaction's impact on competition. United States v. E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 
593-95 (1957). If the acquisition may substantially lessen competition in any market, it violates the law."
57,4," In Citizen Publishing, 394 U.S. 131 (1969), the Supreme Court, relying on its holding in International Shoe, restated a third 
requirement for a successful invocation of the failing company defense: that the prospects of reorganization through 
receivership, or through Chapter X or Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, would have to be dim or nonexistent to make the failing 
company doctrine applicable.  Id., at 137-138. The viability of this requirement is currently questionable since, in two later 
decisions, the Supreme Court did not include this requirement while discussing the failing company defense. See U.S. v. 
General Dynamics, 415 U.S. at 507; U.S. v. Greater Buffalo Press, Inc., 402 U.S. 549, 555 (1971). The Court need not decide 
whether or not defendants must prove that the prospects of reorganization under the bankruptcy laws are dim or nonexistent, 
since it finds that defendants have failed to show that the merger is the ""only available"" alternative for Meade. Accordingly, the 
Court will not reach the issue of reorganization under the bankruptcy laws. "
58,5," Shortly after the purchase, Harbour Group negotiated with Mr. Diebel for a retroactive $ 1.5 million reduction in the purchase 
price."
58,6," Harbour Group presented no affidavit from the official at the Bank of Boston, did not depose any official from the Bank of 
Boston, and did not file any document from the Bank of Boston which establishes precisely what the Bank of Boston intends to 
do regarding Harbour Group's loan at the present time."
58,7," Likewise the Court finds it unnecessary to decide the viability of a ""failing division"" defense. The FTC has urged the Court to 
hold that Meade is a division of Harbour Group, and that as a division of a healthy company, it is not entitled to protection from 
the antitrust laws under the ""failing company"" defense. The Court will not accept FTC's invitation to construe this unsettled area 
of the law."
58,8," The bank had informed the company that it had to raise an additional $ 200,000 in new capital before it would extend further 
credit. Id., at 101. "
59,9," Indeed, it appears that Harbour Group's efforts to find alternative purchasers were motivated by advice of legal counsel, after 
most of the deal with Diethelm had been completed. Ralph Lobdell, the President of Harbour Group, testified by affidavit that ""in 
early May 1990, we were advised by our counsel that if we were going to rely on the fact that Meade was a failing company to 
protect the contemplated joint venture from any possible antitrust challenge, it would be necessary for us to demonstrate that 
there were no alternative purchasers who would pay a reasonable price to acquire Meade."" Affidavit of Ralph Lobdell at 9."
59,10," Ralph Lobdell testified that in the fall of 1989, Harbour Group ""went out and made inquiries into several businesses . . . to buy 
them."" Plaintiff's Exhibit 170 at 38. However, it appears that these contacts were to explore the possibility of Harbour Group 
purchasing another business. Regardless of the purpose for which Harbour Group approached these businesses, the Court 
finds that the approaches were not matched by the interest and intensity with which Harbour Group approached Celestron."
59,11," Although Harbour Group contacted other brokers, most refused to conduct the search, given Meade's small size. Additionally, 
the Court finds that other brokers contacted by Harbour Group handled the Meade project informally, with a pronounced lack of 
direction and effort. It is not surprising that this half-hearted effort resulted in no interested purchasers for Meade."
59,12," Harbour Group contends that the June 29, 1990, date was chosen to comply with the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period which 
would expire on that date. Defendant Harbour Group's Proposed Findings, at 30. They further imply that Harbour Group's hands 
were tied by Governmental regulation, suggesting that it is impossible to seek out alternative purchasers and obtain FTC 
approval of a proposed merger simultaneously. The FTC's rules require attestation that a contract, agreement in principle or 
letter of intent to merge be executed before the FTC's process of antitrust review commences. Harbour Group misses the point. "
60,," Before it was close to reaching a final agreement with Diethelm, Harbour Group should have conducted the bona fide search for 
an alternative purchaser required by the antitrust laws. Waiting to commence the search until the deal is near completion and 
until the process of governmental review begins will unlikely result in a search that will pass muster under the ""failing company"" 
defense."
60,13," According to the FTC, potential alternative purchasers, knowing of the pending deal between Harbour Group and Diethelm, 
would unlikely take steps toward structuring an alternative purchase, for fear of liability for interference with a preexisting 
agreement, akin to the liability recognized in Texaco v. Pennzoil, 729 S.W. 2d 768 (Tex. Ct. App. 1987). Plaintiff's Answer to 
Defendants' Prehearing Memoranda, at 36-37. "
68,1," The Affidavits of both Jean-Louis Arcand, Director of United States Operations for CBC, and Frank S. Schatz, the only 
professional employee in CBC Enterprises' New York office, state that for the fiscal year April 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986, ""CBC 
had income of $ 1,031.1 million Canadian [dollars]."" Affidavit of Jean Louis-Arcand, September 3, 1987, at paragraph 6; Affidavit 
of Frank S. Schatz, September 2, 1987, at paragraph 17. The affidavits of Messieurs Arcand and Schatz further state that with 
over $ 1 billion Canadian income, during that same fiscal year CBC had $ 2,818,222 Canadian income from sources in the 
United States. Id. at paragraphs 7 and 18, respectively. As CBC points out, its income from United States sources is less than 
three tenths of one percent of its total income. Memorandum in Support of CBC Motion to Dismiss at 9. "
73,1," Plaintiff alleges, among other things, procedural and substantive irregularities in the hearing process. Those questions are not 
before the court at this time. "
75,2," Both parties agree that SEAP members are independent contractors, and not employees of the association. "
81,1," Plaintiffs sought to disqualify the Honorable Louis C. Bechtle pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455 on the grounds that he had appeared 
on the same panel discussion as defense counsel Robert C. Heim during a meeting of the Philadelphia Bar Association. This 
panel discussed several features of multidistrict litigation and in no way touched upon any issues related to this case. Such 
activity benefits both bench and bar and is not the sort of conflict contemplated by § 455. Furthermore, this panel discussion was 
well advertised by the Philadelphia Bar Association in pamphlets and legal newspapers. Any objection by plaintiff's counsel 
should have been raised at that time or it is waived. United States v. Nobel, 696 F.2d 231, 236 (3d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 462 
U.S. 1118 (1983) (party may waive objection under § 455(a)) The fact that plaintiff's counsel was delinquent in his bar 
association dues and did not receive these periodicals is an insufficient excuse to prevent waiver. "
82,2," In a handwritten letter dated October 12, 1979, Stoneback wrote to J.S Rennie, Area Manager of Ford Motor Credit Company,: ""I am happy to submit a file on the subject dealer [Wenner Ford Equipment Company] switching from Private Capital to Dealer 
Development. This has been a high risk account for us. If the corporation did not go DD, it would have gone 'down the tube' at 
some point."" Plaintiff's Exhibit 141. "
84,3," Defendants' claim that the court's failure to instruct the jury that the evidence must have proven a motive to conspire was error 
and requires a new trial. In support, defendants' cite the Supreme court's decision in Matsushita, supra, 475 U.S. 574, a case 
alleging an antitrust violation based on 20 years of predatory pricing. The court gave the standard charge on antitrust conspiracy as set forth in 3 E.Devitt, C. Blackmar & M. Wolff, Federal Jury 
Practice and Instructions, §§ 90.07-10 (1987) & Supp.) and American Bar Association, Sample Jury Instructions in Civil Antitrust 
Cases (1987). These instructions, taken as a whole, are sufficient in instructing the jury on the elements of antitrust conspiracy. 
To the extent they fail to incorporate defendants' requested instruction on motive, their motion for a new trial is denied. "
93,1," The decisions of this court concerning the clear articulation requirement have, in some instances, lacked clarity. Although we 
have repeatedly reiterated the need for a ""two step test,"" different decisions have posited two different ""steps."" Compare Boone, 
841 F.2d at 890 (two step test requires proof that the legislature: 1) authorized the challenged actions and 2) intended to 
displace competition with regulation), with Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 726 F.2d 1430, 1433 (9th Cir. 
1984) (two step test requires: 1) proof of an existence of a state policy to displace competition with regulation and 2) proof that 
the legislature contemplated the kind of actions alleged to be anticompetitive), rev'd on other grounds, 475 U.S. 608, 106 S. Ct. 
1395, 89 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1986). Some cases have asked only one question in determining whether or not state action immunity 
attaches. See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, 800 F.2d 1498, 1505 (9th Cir. 1986) rev'd on other grounds 486 U.S. 94, 108 S. Ct. 1658, 
100 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1988) (plaintiffs must show that ""the legislature contemplated the kind of activity complained of. That is, it must 
be clear that the legislature intended to replace competition with regulation."" (citations omitted)). See also Mercy-Peninsula 
Ambulance v. San Mateo County, 791 F.2d 755, 757 (9th Cir. 1986); Kern-Tulare, 828 F.2d at 520. We follow the two step test set forth in Boone. Analytically all the tests are similar and address the same concerns. However, the 
Boone division between consideration of ""authorization"" and ""intent"" adroitly separates the threshold issue of whether or not the 
City is acting pursuant to any authority at all. "
94,2," Appellants do contend that the statutes involved do not contemplate ""price regulation, much less stabilization at the behest of 
private competitors."" However, it is safe to assume that no statute would explicitly authorize such conduct, and appellants' 
contention that the state did not authorize malicious conduct on the part of the City will be considered under the subject of intent, 
the second prong of the test. "
101,1," Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-611(h) (1988) provides the following: (h) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a dealer from making, or offering or advertising to make, sales at retail which are 
made in good faith to compete with the equally low or lower retail price of a competitor. Provided, however, such sales at 
retail under this provision by a vertically integrated producer shall be made in accordance with subsection (b). "
102,2," This fourth element states HN3[
] the ""standing"" requirement set forth in the TPTPA at § 47-25-611(d)(1): (d)(1) Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by a violation or threatened violation of 
subsection (a) may commence a civil action on his own behalf against any dealer who is alleged to be in violation of this 
section, to recover actual and special damages, for payment of civil penalties, and to enjoin the dealer who has violated, is 
violating or who is otherwise likely to violate this section. No person whose sales were exempt or who acted in good faith 
believing his sales were exempt shall be denied injunctive relief, if appropriate. "
105,3," Defendant has provided transcripts of the debates within the Tennessee General Assembly over enactment of the below-cost 
selling provisions of the TPTPA. The remarks of Representative Kisber, one of the sponsors of the legislation, indicate that the 
legislature was most concerned with predatory pricing. For example, at one point Representative Kisber remarked: ""You have to 
sell below it where the purpose and effect are to drive out competition, predatory pricing. If you are lowering price to meet 
competition, if you're lowering your price for some other purpose, we've talked about short-term promotions and things like that, 
if the effect there is not to drive out competition, you can do so."" See Defendant's Brief, at 12."
105,4," The United States Supreme Court has held that even when a case involves an issue of intent, the party opposing a motion for 
summary judgment must produce evidence which would prevent the issuance of a directed verdict if the case were to proceed to 
trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Ghem has failed to produce "
106,," sufficient evidence on the issue of Mapco's alleged predatory intent to prevent the issuance of a directed verdict for Mapco if the 
case were to proceed to trial. "
110,1," CertainTeed's motion for summary judgment as to Count II of the complaint was granted by Judge Duff prior to the 
reassignment of this case. Reserve Supply Corporation v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, 639 F. Supp. 1457, 1467-68 
(N.D. Ill. 1986). Thus, Owens-Corning is the only remaining defendant named in this count. "
115,2," Reserve also claims that Owens-Corning initiated lower prices to Wickes and 84 Lumber. Reserve, however, does not claim 
any injury from these transactions. "

118,1," Ameron first cites Coal Resources, Inc. v. Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., 865 F.2d 761, 772 n.4 (6th Cir. 1989). In the first 
place, Coal Resources is not even an antitrust case; it involved damages due to fraud. Coal Resources referred to an 
unpublished opinion which in turn cited Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383, 392 (6th Cir. 1962), 
cert. denied, 372 U.S. 907 (1963). Volasco Products is an antitrust damages case, but has been implicitly overruled by 
subsequent Sixth Circuit decisions, the first of which outright rejected the ""reasonable certainty"" test in favor of the ""reasonable 
estimate"" standard.  Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. v. Lorain Journal Co., 358 F.2d 790, 793 (6th Cir. 1966); Bell v. Cherokee

Western Union Telegraph, 797 F.2d 370, 383 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 934 (1987). Finally, Fed. Prescription Serv. v. Am. Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 484 F. Supp. 1195 (D.D.C. 1980), stated both the correct standard, 
id. at 1210, and the incorrect standard, id. at 1211. When the case reached the D.C. Circuit, however, the court of appeals was 
careful to distinguish between the two standards.  Fed. Prescription Serv. v. Am. Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 663 F.2d 253, 268 (D.C. 
Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 928 (1982). See also, Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 593 F.2d 1173, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1978). "
123,1," Meanwhile, in complaints filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, several ""direct purchasers,"" i.e., 
retailers of soft drinks in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, had brought a class action against the same defendants for 
violation of the federal antitrust laws. Those claims resulted in a settlement of approximately $ 4,500,000 adopted by the District 
Court in May of 1989. "
124,2," The parties are in accord that the District of Columbia antitrust act is patterned after the federal parens patriae statute, the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 15c. Whereas that law makes specific provision for court approval 
of any proposed dismissal or compromise of the action, however, the District's antitrust statute has no such provision. 
Nevertheless, by analogy to the federal statute and the requirements for a class action, see Super. Ct. Civ. R. 23 (e) (1990), the 
District proposed that the parties seek court approval of the settlement, and appellees consented. Since no one has opposed 
recourse to the court for approval throughout these proceedings, we need not -- and do not -- decide that judicial approval is 
necessary under the District's antitrust statute. "

125,4," In disputing it, appellants rely substantially on an affidavit by Leonard Goodman in the record below reporting a statement to 
him by an Assistant Corporation Counsel that the documents received from the defendants informally had been ""mostly 
transactional"" and ""not very helpful."" Whatever the former phrase may mean, the trial judge did not err in giving little weight to 
this affidavit in view of the District's contrary representations in court that the settlement had been reached based on adequate 
information and a reasoned evaluation of the District's case. Nor did the District's failure to employ use immunity, see D.C. Code 
§ 28-4505 (g)(7), other than for a single witness cast doubt on the settlement in view of the pre-complaint interviews the District 
had held with some company executives and its access to the records of the Department of Justice's investigation. Appellants further argue that a bill of particulars submitted by federal prosecutors in the criminal antitrust litigation involving 
Edward L. Wynns, a former vice-president of GC-Washington, should have made District investigators realize that the 
conspiracy -- and hence the damages to District of Columbia consumers -- extended over a period of five years and not just the 
two years alleged in the District's parens patriae complaint. Wynns, however, eventually pleaded guilty to one count of perjury, 
not conspiracy, and given the fact that the United States government accepted pleas by the corporate defendants to 
conspiracies covering only eleven months, we will not second-guess the trial judge's conclusion that any evidence the District 
could hope to obtain of a five-year conspiracy was ""speculative."" "
126,5," To like effect, and factually even closer on point, is in In re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, 76 F.R.D. 460 (D. Conn. 1977), aff'd 
mem., 580 F.2d 1045 (2d Cir. 1978). There the defendants settled with plaintiffs representing a class of indirect purchasers 
shortly before the Supreme Court ruled in Illinois Brick that indirect purchasers have no claim for damages under federal 
antitrust law. The defendants then moved to vacate the judgment entered on the basis of their settlement, and the District Court 
denied the motion. The court made clear that its ruling would apply equally to plaintiffs or defendants who might seek similar 
relief from a settlement based on a subsequent change in the law. The pending petition for certiorari in Illinois Brick was a question mark for all parties. These were all contingencies the litigants 
were free to compromise by way of settlement. But for the legal risks of their claims, plaintiffs might well have demanded a far 
greater sum of money before consenting to the dismissal of the actions. If Illinois Brick had been decided in favor of the indirect 
purchasers, plaintiffs could not complain that they settled too cheaply. Defendants are in a similar position. Both sides were at 
risk; they got exactly what they bargained for."
126,76, F.R.D. at 464-65 (footnotes omitted). 
127,6," See In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 556 F. Supp. 806, 807 (N.D. Ill. 1983)."
127,7," In addition, the trial court noted that because the pleas of guilty taken in the criminal antitrust actions covered a conspiracy of 
only eleven months, the District would have to prove about one-half of its claims -- based upon an alleged two-year conspiracy -- 
without the evidentiary benefit of those pleas."
127,8," We are not persuaded, for example, that the District's estimate mistook a one-year damage figure computed in the District 
Court litigation for a two-year figure, thus halving a portion of the actual damages."
127,9," Nor is there any reason to disturb the court's findings with respect to the remaining factors courts have considered in reviewing 
proposed settlements. The court found that the record on March 24, 1989 permitted a conclusion that the settlement was reached as a result of good-faith bargaining at 
arm's length between experienced counsel. Although the antitrust statute is of recent origin, there was no suggestion that 
counsel for the District of Columbia was not qualified to handle substantial litigation. Further, there was no suggestion of 
collusion. Indeed, the governmental nature of the case obviated any concern that counsel may have sought settlement to insure 
a fee. The absence of significant opposition from any source other than [appellants] also mitigated [sic; militated] in favor of 
approving the settlement. "
128,10," HN6[
] Section 28-4507(b)(2)(B) provides that money recovered in an antitrust action and deemed a civil penalty shall be deposited with the District of Columbia, subject to the requirement ""that any distribution procedures adopted shall first afford 
each person a reasonable opportunity to secure each such person's appropriate portion of the net monetary relief."" "
133,1," This circuit has traditionally applied a ""target area"" test that embraces substantially the same factors. In Amey, Inc. v. Gulf 
Abstract & Title, Inc., 758 F.2d 1486, 1496 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1107, 106 S. Ct. 1513, 89 L. Ed. 2d 912 
(1986), we held that our ""target area"" test does not produce materially different results from application of the Associated 
Contractors guidelines. Under either test, the key factors are ""the physical and economic nexus between the alleged violation 
and the harm to the plaintiff, and . . . the relationship of the injury alleged with those forms of injury about which Congress was 
likely to have been concerned in making defendant's conduct unlawful and in providing a private remedy under § 4."" McCready, 
457 U.S. at 478, 102 S. Ct. at 2547-48; Amey, 758 F.2d at 1496-97."
133,2," For purposes of this standing analysis and to separate the standing issue from the merits of the antitrust claims, we will assume 
that a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act has in fact occurred. "
134,3," We need not decide whether those two factors are dispositive, since other Associated General factors also indicate a lack of 
standing. "
135,4," This case was decided prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981, and is binding precedent in this circuit under 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)."
135,5," Even where there is concerted action refusing to deal, an anticompetitive purpose or effect would still be a necessary element 
of a Sherman Act violation. See Malcolm v. Marathon Oil Co., 642 F.2d 845, 860-61 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1125, 102 
S. Ct. 975, 71 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1981) (quoting Aladdin Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 603 F.2d 1107, 1115 (5th Cir. 1979)). "
136,6," As the discussion in the text implies, this lack of an antitrust injury also indicates that Barclays has not violated § 2 at all. See 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) (failure to prove antitrust 
injury prevents recovery of damages). That failure, however, is also indicative of a lack of standing. In Associated Contractors, 
459 U.S. at 538-39, 103 S. Ct. at 908-09, the Supreme Court cited Brunswick for the proposition that, as part of an antitrust 
standing analysis, ""the alleged injury must be analyzed to determine whether it is of the type that the antitrust statute was 
intended to forestall."" The fact that Mr. Furniture's lack of an antitrust injury demonstrates the absence of an antitrust violation 
renders problematic the application of some of the Associated General guidelines for determining standing. For example, it is 
difficult to examine the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the injury (as well as the directness of the injury) 
where there is no antitrust violation. Suffice it to say, however, that Mr. Furniture has failed to demonstrate that its injury was 
caused by Barclays' violation of § 2. Moreover, we do not interpret Associated Contractors to require that all of its guidelines be 
met."
136,7," We find no merit in Mr. Furniture's contention that the district court's failure to permit deliberation on punitive damages may 
have affected the jury's calculation of general damages. "
137,8," Mr. Furniture's contention that the very fact that Stenhouse was involved with the Mr. Furniture account raises an inference that 
he also knew or approved of Strickland's statement is unsupported by the record. Testimony adduced at trial does indicate that 
Stenhouse knew about Mr. Furniture's credit difficulties despite the fact that Strickland had authority to approve credit for Mr. 
Furniture without consulting Stenhouse. However, the testimony also shows that Stenhouse did not learn of Mr. Furniture's 
problem until August or September of 1986, R15-149, some months after the defamatory statement, which was made in June or 
July of 1986. SR2-9. "
144,*," Honorable C. Clyde Atkins, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by designation."
144,1," Home health care coordinators (or nurses) are registered nurses employed by independent companies known as home health 
care agencies. The agencies, through their employee nurses, provide skilled nursing care to patients in the patient's home after 
they are discharged from the hospital. "
145,2," Plaintiff's expert Dr. Blair has considerable expertise in the antitrust economics area. He has published numerous articles and 
has co-authored a text book on the subject. Additionally, he has worked with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and 
has testified in numerous trials as an antitrust expert."
145,3," In a rental market where a firm's share of new referrals is increasing, the figures for current market share based on income will 
be lower than the figures for market share based on new referrals. Once the percentage of new referrals stabilizes and old 
accounts with competitors close out, the income based market share will approach the new referral market share."
145,4," Both the home health care agency and its individual nurses must be granted hospital privileges to work with the patients while 
they are still in Venice Hospital. There are certain documentation requirements and the agency or nurse must submit an 
application. The application is reviewed by the executive committee of the medical staff which makes a recommendation to the 
board of directors. The board makes the final decision. "
148,5," Bowers testified that approximately 50% expressed an affirmative choice; his logs showed that figure to be closer to 40%. It 
seems to us interesting -- and the jury could have noted this as well -- that there was such a large discrepancy between MPAC's 
evidence and the testimony presented by the home health care nurses. "
149,6," In its brief as amicus curiae, Voluntary Hospitals of America, Inc. argues that vertical integration is necessary for hospitals to 
survive in the present day health care industry. This may be the case; however, the health care industry has no blanket immunity 
from the antitrust laws. Jefferson Parish Hosp. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1565 n. 42, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). In Otter 
Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 1031, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973), the Court rejected Otter Tail's "
150,," argument that it needed to exclude possible competitors to survive and concluded that the Sherman ""Act assumes that an 
enterprise will protect itself against loss by operating with superior service, lower costs and improved efficiency."" Our decision 
today does not limit the ability of firms to vertically integrate when that integration does not unnecessarily exclude competition, or 
is not undertaken to monopolize or restrain trade. "
151,7," The district court noted that prices have actually gone down and that the market is less concentrated than it was prior to the 
joint venture. 703 F. Supp. at 1519. Dr. Blair testified that the Herfendall-Hirschman Index -- a measure of market concentration -
- dropped from 5708 when VCA's market share was at its peak to 4780 now. Appellees argue that this shows the joint venture 
has had a procompetitive effect on the market. The Department of Justice Merger Guidelines use this methodology to evaluate 
whether a merger will result in impermissible market concentration. See A. Stickells, Federal Control of Business, 1989 
Cumulative Supplement, Appendix A at 627 (1989). The Department considers a market with an Index over 1800 to be highly 
concentrated. Id. "
155,8," The hospital argues that it simply asked the home health care nurses to use its affiliated DME vendor and that its conduct is no 
different from any competitor hawking its product. During the argument on its motion for a directed verdict, appellees' counsel 
rhetorically asked ""what was the hospital supposed to do?"" Counsel questioned whether the hospital was supposed to 
encourage the home health care nurses to use competing DME vendors. We have set out in this opinion the conduct which may 
be described as anticompetitive. The list includes much more than the simple hawking of wares. "

167,4," This court's November 26, 1990 Memorandum and Order ""noted that exclusivity in the television industry is not strictly

were inadvertently removed from the text following adoption of the Report and Order in Gen. Docket No. 87-24 (53 FR

stations in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, foreign stations or noncommercial educational television or ""public"" television 
stations (either by way of restrictions on their exclusivity or on exclusivity against them)."
167,54," Fed. Reg. 46,901 (to be codified at 47 C.F.R. Section 73.658(m)). With this amendment, Section 73.658(m) appears to limit 
exclusivity as to commercial television stations, but does not limit exclusivity by or against ""educational television or 'public' 
television stations."" "
169,5," ETAMC and Betty Cope's reference to a world market comes from the following testimony of NETO president Torey Southwick, 
taken pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6): Q. Is it NETO's contention any of the other defendants have market power? A. Well, EEN through the Interregional Program Service, through its ability to aggregate stations throughout the country to 
make group purchases, and of very attractive programs, certainly affects the availability of those programs as they might be 
available through individual syndicators. Q. What is the market that you perceive EEN operates in? A. I would -- I guess I would have to suggest it's world market. When you have the ability to aggregate most public 
television stations in the country together in group buys for specific programs, that would certainly give you some power in 
acquiring the rights to those programs for those stations no matter where in the world they might be purchased. Appendix to the Memorandum of Defendants Educational Television Association of Metropolitan Cleveland and Betty Cope in

174,11, This court accordingly makes no determination as to whether or not such a private cause of action exists or not. 
180,1, The Court has not yet certified the class.
180,2," Plaintiffs seek treble damages for violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act and Florida Antitrust Act of 1980, Fla. Stat. § 542.19

Wiring, 5 F.C.C. Rec. 3407 (May 31, 1990) (second further notice of proposed rulemaking)."
181,5," The Court recognizes that standing is jurisdictional and that a defendant may bring a factual attack on plaintiff's standing. In this 
case, however, Defendant clearly brings only a facial challenge to Plaintiffs' antitrust standing. See Defendant's ""Statement of 
Material Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 10.J.2,"" at p. 1. "
182,6," The so-called ""target zone test"" used by the Eleventh Circuit to determine antitrust standing comprises the five factors 
enunciated by the Supreme Court in Associated General Contractors. Austin, 903 F.2d at 1389."
182,7," Stated another way, this aspect of HN6[
] antitrust standing requires that the injury alleged not only be ""of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent [but also] flow from that which makes defendants' act unlawful."" Brunswick Corp. v. 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)."
182,8," Exhibit 9 to the Cresse deposition, filed in opposition to Defendant's motion, is entitled ""Inside Wire Survey."" This survey 
certainly would create an issue as to whether telephone companies using a negative option generally gained a substantially 
greater share of the telephone users market than did the telephone companies that used positive options. (It should be noted, "
183,," however, that the relevant market for measuring whether a particular company has a monopoly has not yet been defined.) 
Although Defendant brings only a facial attack on Plaintiffs' standing to bring the antitrust claims, the additional facts alleged by 
Plaintiffs highlight that the allegations of the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, support an inference of 
antitrust injury."
183,9," Plaintiffs alleged that Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co. monopolized the market for IWMS in violation of § 2 of the 
Sherman Act through negative option contracts for IWMS. 121 F.R.D. at 420-21."
183,10," In footnote 10 to the supplemental brief, Plaintiffs offer to provide an affidavit from an expert witness setting forth the economic 
theory and evidentiary facts supporting Plaintiffs' assertion that competition would have limited the price of IWMS absent 
Southern Bell's practices. Moreover, at oral argument, Plaintiffs stated that Southern Bell intended to exclude Sears, Roebuck 
from the IWMS market. The Court need not consider these facts, as Defendant's challenge to Plaintiffs' standing is on the face of 
the complaint. These are the types of facts that Plaintiffs will ultimately need to prove, but clearly not all of them must be 
included in the complaint."
183,11," It would not be enough, for example, to show that Southern Bell abused its monopoly power by overcharging customers for 
IWMS: the courts have held that exploitative monopoly pricing is not unlawful in and of itself. See Continental Cablevision of 
Ohio v. American Elec. Power Co., 715 F.2d 1115 (6th Cir. 1983); Berkey Photo Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263 (2d 
Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 100 S. Ct. 1061, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1980). Rather, to entitle them to judgment Plaintiffs 
must prove that absent Southern Bell's anticompetitive practices, Southern Bell would not have enjoyed a monopoly in the IWMS 
market and competition would have resulted in lower prices for consumers. The Court need not decide at this juncture whether 
consumers of the IWMS should also be deemed competitors in the IWMS market. See Homeco Dev. v. Markborough Properties 
Ltd., 709 F. Supp. 1137 (S.D. Fla. 1989) (consumers also competitors). "
184,12," Plaintiffs initially requested more time for discovery if the Court were inclined to grant Defendant's motion for summary 
judgment. By affidavit filed June 21, 1990, Plaintiffs' counsel withdrew the request for any additional discovery, and subsequently 
have failed to reinstate the request for additional discovery."
184,13," Plaintiffs rely heavily on Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976), to support their 
position that a ""clearly articulated"" State policy is not present in this case. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' reliance on Cantor is 
misplaced in light of the more recent Southern Motor Carriers opinion. See Metro Mobile CTS, Inc. v. Newvector 
Communications, Inc., 661 F. Supp. 1504, 1513 (D. Ariz. 1987) (reliance on Cantor misplaced), aff'd on other grounds, 892 F.2d 
62 (9th Cir. 1989). "
185,14," The F.C.C. currently intends to preempt the regulation of IWMS to the extent of requiring that such service be unbundled from 
other services. The F.C.C., however, has stated that in light of the Court of Appeals decision in National Ass'n of Regulatory "
186,," Utility Com'rs v. F.C.C., 279 U.S. App. D.C. 99, 880 F.2d 422 (D.C. Cir. 1989), it does not intend to preempt price regulation, 
regulation of terms and conditions of service, or provider's last resort regulation. See In the Matter of Detariffing the Installation 
of Maintenance of Inside Wiring, 5 F.C.C. Rec. 3407 (May 31, 1990) (second further notice of proposed rulemaking)."
186,15," In Newvector, the court noted that footnote 25 of the Supreme Court's opinion in Southern Motor Carriers, supra, could be 
read to preclude antitrust immunity where the PSC could choose competition as a method of fulfilling its legislative mandate. 661 
F. Supp. at 1516. The example the Supreme Court refers to in footnote 25 of a case in which the State failed to clearly articulate 
a policy is Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 102 S. Ct. 835, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982). Boulder, however, 
is completely inapposite upon the facts of the instant case. See Newvector, 661 F. Supp. at 1516 n. 8. In Boulder, the State 
constitution gave municipalities ""home rule"" powers. 102 S. Ct. at 837. Pursuant to the ""home rule"" law, the City of Boulder 
enacted an ordinance prohibiting a local cable company from expanding its business. 102 S. Ct. at 837-38. The cable company 
sued the City of Boulder. The Supreme Court held that the home rule law did not amount to a clearly articulated policy permitting the City of Boulder's 
anticompetitive conduct, stating that ""[a] State that allows its municipalities to do as they please can hardly be said to have 
'contemplated' the specific anticompetitive actions for which municipal liability is sought."" 102 S. Ct. at 843. In contrast, in this 
case, the legislature of the State of Florida gave the PSC broad authority to regulate the entire field of basic telephone service, 
which at the time included IWMS. Thus, unlike Boulder, in which there was absolutely no relation between the ""home rule"" law 
and the City's restriction of cable service, in the instant case the State authorized regulation of a specific field and thus the 
anticompetitive conduct was clearly within the legislature's contemplation. See also Auton v. Dade City, 783 F.2d 1009 (11th Cir. 
1986) (distinguishing Boulder). "
187,16," Plaintiffs do not dispute that the PSC had the authority to decide the manner in which IWMS options would be offered to 
customers."
187,17," Plaintiff present substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue as to whether the Commissioners themselves considered the 
negative option issue. For example, former Commissioner Cresse testified as follows: Q. Did you authorize a negative option. . . .? A. If, I guess you could answer that two ways, if by saying you submit this to the staff and have the staff review and approve 
it, then to that extent yes, we authorized it. But did we [the Commissioners] address specifically this language, the answer 
is no. Cresse deposition, April 12, 1990, at 25.  [**30] "
188,18," The Court notes that this case differs significantly from the case in which the regulated utility misrepresents facts to the 
relevant agency. Southern Bell completely disclosed its intended use of a negative option to the PSC when it submitted the bill 
stuffer to the staff of the PSC for approval. "
189,19," The Court also denies Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' leveraging allegations for failure to state a cause of action 
under § 2 of the Sherman Act because Plaintiffs may be able to prove facts which would entitle them to judgment on the federal 
antitrust claims."
189,20," In light of this Court's ruling on the state action doctrine, the Court finds Defendant's argument regarding the Keogh doctrine 
moot. "
199,1," There is a more recent case, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Hornung, 754 S.W.2d 855 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988), which 
provides a discussion of the development of tortious interference in Kentucky. Berea as well as other cases, are further clarified 
within the text. Berea remains valid law in Kentucky. "
204,1," Indeed, defendants' own actions demonstrate that Remington II was not a final order subject to appeal. Shortly after the Court 
decided Remington II, defendants moved to certify the ruling for immediate interlocutory review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292 
(b), rather than appeal as of right under § 1291 which applies to final orders. "
206,2," As one district court stated: ""The federal antitrust laws impose additional standing requirements beyond those required by 
Article III of the Constitution. The law is clear that a private plaintiff must demonstrate 'antitrust injury' in order to have standing 
under the Clayton Act to challenge a merger."" First and First, Inc. v. Dunkin' Donuts, Inc., 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7432, 256 (E.D. 
Penn. March 27, 1990) (citations omitted). "
207,3," ""Predation involves deliberate seeking of monopoly power by means other than superior efficiency, by means that would not be 
employed in the normal course of competition."" Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 252 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 786 F.2d 424, 427 
(D.C. Cir. 1986). A single definition of predatory pricing is difficult to establish: [In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986),] we 
declined to define precisely the term ""predatory pricing"" but stated instead that ""for purposes of this case it is enough to 
note that respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless petitioners conspired to drive petitioners out of the 
relevant markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some appropriate 
measure of cost."" . . . We have no occasion in the instant case to consider the proper definition of predatory pricing, nor to 
determine whether our dictum in Matsushita that predatory pricing might consist of ""pricing below the level necessary to sell 
[the offender's] products, is an accurate statement of the law."""
207,110," S. Ct. at 1892, n. 10 (quoting 475 U.S. at 585, n. 8). "
208,4," As the Supreme Court has observed, ""actions per se unlawful under the antitrust laws may nonetheless have some 
procompetitive effects, and private parties might suffer losses therefrom."" ARCO, 110 S. Ct. at 1894. "
215,*," Hon. Edward D. Re, Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation. "
216,1," In 1985, Ticor filed suit against the FTC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the 
prosecution of this action solely on grounds that the FTC was unconstitutionally exercising executive branch authority in violation 
of the principle of separation of powers. The district court dismissed the challenge as unripe since the FTC had yet to take final 
action. See Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 625 F. Supp. 747 (D.D.C. 1986), aff'd, 259 U.S. App. D.C. 202, 814 F.2d 731 (D.C. Cir. 
1987). While the court of appeals affirmed the district court's dismissal of the constitutional challenge, the three judges on its 
panel wrote separate opinions, no one of which garnered a majority, concerning whether the district court's dismissal was 
justified by a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, a lack of final agency action or a lack of ripeness. See Ticor, 259 U.S. 
App. D.C. 202, 814 F.2d 731."
216,2," One of the six original respondents, First American Title Insurance Company, settled the charges against it in a consent 
agreement with the FTC. See In re Ticor Title Ins. Co., No. 9190 (July 30, 1987) (LEXIS, Trade library, FTC file). Thus, the FTC's 
final order affected only five title insurance companies, all of whom have joined as petitioners before this Court."
216,3," In the weeks following the FTC's initiation of this action in 1985, thirteen class action suits were filed against the insurance 
companies. The suits were consolidated for pretrial purposes and were settled in a judgment entered in June of 1986. Two state 
court challenges to the settlement judgment are pending, one in Arizona and one in Wisconsin."
216,4," The initial complaint also challenged the insurers' collective formulation and filing of charges for settlement and escrow 
services. The FTC, in its final order, dismissed these portions of the complaint since the FTC's complaint counsel failed to 
develop a record sufficient to sustain the charges. Thus, the final order only affects the insurers' collectively set rates for title 
search and examination services."
216,5," HN1[
] The ""state action"" doctrine protects private price-fixing if such conduct is (1) undertaken pursuant to a clearly 
articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition with regulation and (2) the state itself actively "
217,," supervises the conduct. See California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 
100 S. Ct. 937 (1980). The original complaint challenged joint price-setting in thirteen states. The insurers raised the state action defense with respect 
to twelve of these thirteen states. Following the Supreme Court's decision in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. 
United States, 471 U.S. 48, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 105 S. Ct. 1721 (1985), the FTC's complaint counsel declined to pursue charges 
concerning five of the thirteen states. The issues tried before the ALJ relating to the state action defense were: (1) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, did the states 
authorize joint rate-setting of title search and examination charges for attorney-agents and (2) in Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, 
Montana, Ohio and Wisconsin, was there active state supervision."
217,6," The FTC's full compliment of commissioners is five. Commissioner Machol did not participate in the decision that resulted in the 
final order in this matter. Furthermore, Commission Chairman Steiger did not participate in the decision leading to the final order 
because she took her post after the FTC reached its decision but before the decision was issued. Chairman Steiger's 
predecessor, Chairman Oliver, ""prior to leaving the Commission . . . registered his vote in the affirmative for the Final Order and 
the Opinion of the Commission in this matter."" Joint Appendix (Jt. App.) at 126 n.*."
217,7," Commissioner Calvani dissented as to this conclusion. In its amicus brief filed in support of the insurers, the Pennsylvania 
Insurance Department, which is the state executive branch agency responsible for the execution and enforcement of all 
Pennsylvania insurance laws, also disagrees with this conclusion so far as it construes the law of Pennsylvania."
217,8," Commissioner Azcuenaga partially dissented from this holding, concluding instead that Arizona and Connecticut did actively 
supervise the insurers' rate-setting activities. "
218,9," This proviso, of course, merely restates the requirements of the state action doctrine. See supra note 5."
218,10, This description is based on the excellent survey of this area that the ALJ compiled in his opinion. See Jt. App. at 32-60. 
219,11," While the FTC issued its decision on September 19, 1989, the sixty days within which to petition for review of the decision did 
not begin to run until the FTC served its decision upon the insurers on October 20, 1989. "
220,12," The Court held that a municipality, in order to qualify for state action immunity, need not satisfy the second prong of the Midcal 
test, which requires that the state actively supervise the anticompetitive conduct. See Hallie, 471 U.S. at 46-47; see also "
221,," Hancock Indus. v. Schaeffer, 811 F.2d 225, 235 (3d Cir. 1987) (""In Hallie, the Court concluded that the second element of the 
Midcal analysis did not apply when a municipality was the decisionmaker.""). "
222,13," The word ""them"" in the Act's definition of ""fee"" lacks an antecedent. However, reference to the immediately preceding 
definition, which explains the meaning of the term ""premium,"" sheds light on this problem. HN8[
] Section 17:46B-1(e) states: ""Premium"" for title insurance means that portion of the fee charged by a title insurance company, agent of a title insurance 
company or approved attorney of a title insurance company, or any of them, to an insured or to an applicant for insurance, 
for the assumption by the title insurance company of the risk created by the issuance of the title insurance policy. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 17:46B-1(e). "
223,14," The Act also provides any aggrieved person with the ability to challenge any of the Commissioner's actions. See N.J. Stat. 
Ann. § 17:46B-52. The FTC has failed to bring to our attention any state challenge to the Commissioner's approval of collectively 
set rates that attorney-agents charge for search and examination services. "
227,15," Arizona's rating bureau went out of business for all purposes on December 16, 1981. See Jt. App. at 83. Arizona revoked the 
rating bureau's corporate charter on October 1, 1983. See id. "
229,16, There is no evidence that Ticor ever supplied this supporting data. See Jt. App. at 90. 
230,17," Because we hold that Ticor's setting of collective rates for search and examinations services in all six states is immune from 
antitrust liability under the state action doctrine, it is unnecessary to consider whether the same activity is also exempt from 
antitrust regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act as the business of insurance or is exempt from antitrust regulation as 
protected petitioning of state regulators under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See, e.g., Southern Motor Carriers Rate 
Conference, 471 U.S. at 55 n. 17 (1985) (finding of state action immunity ""makes it unnecessary to consider the applicability of 
[the Noerr-Pennington] doctrine to the petitioners' collective ratemaking activities.""). Furthermore, we decline to address Ticor's separation of powers argument. This is an attack on the administrative state. 
Whatever the merits of such an attack, Ticor has failed to present us with a fully developed argument; its argument that we 
should hold that the FTC operates in violation of the principle of separation of powers since it performs an executive function and 
yet is not subject to executive branch control is cursory at best, taking up less than two pages of its brief. As the Seventh Circuit 
wrote in a similar situation, ""Brevity may be the soul of wit, but seismic constitutional change is not a laughing matter."" See "
231,," Hospital Corp. of Am. v. FTC, 807 F.2d 1381, 1392 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1038, 95 L. Ed. 2d 815, 107 S. Ct. 
1975 (1987). "
237,1," HN4[
] Rule 3.1 of the Idaho Rules of Professional Conduct states: A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that 
is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the 
defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so 
defend the proceedings as to require that every element of the case be established. "
246,1," On January 10, 1991, the plaintiff filed a motion to set this matter for oral argument. Because this opinion had already been 
written on receipt of the motion, we deny it."
246,2," Dr. Triester had originally joined Marrese in the complaint. However, Dr. Triester is no longer a plaintiff and only Marrese 
remains. While Triester was involved in much of the earlier litigation to which we shall refer, we shall omit reference to him. "
247,3," The court of appeals also ordered the appeal consolidated with an appeal from a criminal contempt order issued by the district 
court for failure of the Academy to comply with a discovery order requiring that it produce its membership files. Finally, the court 
of appeals reversed the contempt order as the discovery order was deemed invalid."
247,4," Related suits involving Marrese include Deaconess Hosp. v. Marrese, No. 82-C10-1986 (Vanderburg Sup. Ct., Aug. 27, 1985) 
and Marrese v. St. Mary's Medical Center, No. 9599 (Vanderburg Cir. Ct.) (November 7, 1983) (for subpoena power to compel 
witness appearances at the St. Mary's review proceedings). "
248,5," Marrese objects to this and other submissions on the grounds that they are inadmissible hearsay. We find, however, that such 
information obtained from doctors who have had dealings with Marrese formed the basis for the Academy's action and are 
submitted here not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but to show the effect that the fruit of the Academy's investigations 
had on the Academy's decision to reject Marrese's application. To the extent that they are offered to show this effect, they are 
not hearsay. "
251,6," The Academy also urges us to consider the possibility that Marrese's inclusion of the denial of hospital privileges is barred by 
either res judicata or collateral estoppel because of the grant of summary judgment to the defendants in Marrese v. Deaconess 
Hosp., No. EV-85-204-C, slip op. (S.D. Ind. Dec. 15, 1989). We need not enter that morass as we find that the denial of 
privileges cannot be brought wholesale into the ""conspiracy"" on the slender thread that Marrese spins."
251,7," We might also note that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana reviewed the Deaconess peer 
review proceedings and determined that they were conducted in good faith. Marrese, No. EV 85-204-C, slip op. (S.D. Ind. Dec. 
15, 1989). "
253,8," Clearly Marrese now intends to concentrate his market power analysis on the Evansville area because of the denial of hospital 
privileges. We cannot accept Marrese's argument that discovery has been inadequate. It has been exhaustive and exhausting in 
this case over the many years since it was filed. Much effort has been expended by the courts to afford Marrese as much 
information as possible, much of it under protective orders. Both this court and Judge Brooks in Evansville have accommodated 
Marrese at every juncture. Marrese has repeatedly requested extensions of cut-off dates and they have been granted. Therefore 
we shall not entertain a complaint at this late date that discovery has been inadequate. While we are on the subject of discovery, the Academy has filed a motion to strike several affidavits filed by Marrese by experts 
whom Marrese had not previously identified. We deny the motion. We have read the material and we find that most of it bears on 
the denials of hospital privileges. The Skoog affidavit speaks to market power and definition issues but reaches only ""tentative 
conclusions"" without supporting data. Skoog's analysis is based on the Glandon affidavit. Both affidavits are inconclusive 
because of allegedly inadequate data from the hospitals, but it is clear that both Glandon and Skoog concern themselves only 
with the Evansville area. "
254,9," Indeed, Marrese does not feel that he need expend much effort in producing material to counter a motion for summary 
judgment. Later in his response, he states that he is entitled to trial and that ""there is no basis for requiring plaintiff to come 
forward now with the detailed evidence that reveals defendant's actions (not to admit, and, locally, to exclude from hospitals) to 
be groundless and that puts in question defendant's good faith."" Response at 43. We feel that Marrese may have misconstrued 
his burden as respondent to a motion for summary judgment. "
255,10, We file a synopsis of the substance of the Academy membership file as a sealed Appendix to this opinion.

259,4," Heavy-duty truck maintenance was cheaper through Volvo GM authorized dealers because Volvo GM offered its franchisees

(doc. 43). "

281,4," In an order dated February 28, 1990, the Court sanctioned Lightwave for its second attempt to introduce evidence on Corning's 
prior antitrust violations. The Court has not yet fixed a dollar amount for the sanction. Corning also moves for sanctions in

296,1," Plaintiffs state that the Court relied ""fulsomely"" on Business Electronics. Plaintiffs' Brief at 9. The current meaning of ""fulsome,"" 
according to Webster's, is ""offensive""; its former sense of ""abundant"" is archaic. The Court trusts that plaintiffs intended the 
archaic meaning. "
297,2," The Court notes that, due to the jurisdictional import of the 10-day filing deadline for Rule 59(e) motions to reconsider, the 
Court may only consider this notice issue with respect to Count IV. "
300,3," The Court of Appeals described the marked in J.F. Feeser -- but apparently the market at the wholesale rather than the supply 
level -- as both ""highly competitive,"" 909 F.2d at 1527, ""intense,"" id. at 1542, and ""limited."" Id. These apparently contradictory 
characterizations may mean that the market power of the suppliers is such that competition at the wholesale level is quite fierce.

338,1," Dr. Todorov has his office at The Neurology Clinic, P.C., a corporation of which he is the sole shareholder. He brought this suit 
in behalf of himself and the corporation. Though the district court did not reach the issue, we conclude that the corporation has 
no standing to sue in this matter. It is Dr. Todorov, not his corporation, who is seeking privileges at DCH and, thus, the relief 
prayed for in this case. Accordingly, in this opinion, we treat Dr. Todorov as the only appellant and the party plaintiff below."
338,2, CT stands for computerized tomograph; a CAT scan (computerized axial tomograph) is a subcategory of this general area.
338,3," On occasion, the radiologist merely consults the referring physician's written prescription for the CT scan."
338,4," Some patients have negative reactions to contrast, causing medical problems. To ensure that such problems are handled 
properly, the radiologist closely monitors the use of contrast during a scan. "
339,5," Sometimes additional information can be obtained by manipulating the data already received by the CT scan computer and 
generating a new film. This reduces the need to administer additional CT scans."
339,6," DCH also is required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH), as a condition of accreditation, to maintain 
adequate medical records on each patient. Joint Comm. on Accreditation of Hospitals, Accreditation Manual for Hospitals 79 
(1984). The JCAH requires that reports of radiological interpretations be included in a patient's medical record and that 
radiological procedures be documented and authenticated in the patient's record within 24 hours of the completion of the 
procedure. Id. at 82, 155. "
340,7," The medical staff bylaws, which contain this provision, do not indicate to whom the board may ""refer the matter for further 
review."" "
341,8," Count four of Dr. Todorov's complaint presented a pendent state law claim against all of the defendants. This count is no longer 
in the case. Count five, which did not allege a cause of action, sought injunctive relief to remedy the violations of law asserted in 
counts one through four."
341,9," For the text of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, see infra part II.B.1."
341,10," These sections of the Clayton Act authorize private actions for violations of the antitrust laws. Section 4 HN1[
] authorizes a 
private action for treble damages and provides, in pertinent part: ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (1988). Section 16 HN2[
] authorizes a 
private action for injunctive relief, and provides, in pertinent part: ""any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to 
sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or 
damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" Id. § 26."
341,11," For the text of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, see infra part II.B.2."
341,12," 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides, in pertinent part: HN3[
] Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or 
the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the 
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be 
liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. "
342,13," As noted above, the district court held that the radiologists were acting as employees of DCH and thus shared its immunity. 
This holding does not comport with our holding in Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Medical Center, 891 F.2d 810, 819 (11th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 495 U.S. 924, 110 S. Ct. 1960, 109 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1990), which came down after the district court granted summary 
judgment. In Bolt, we held that members of a hospital's medical staff should be considered independent legal entities for antitrust 
purposes if they are not employed by the hospital and are acting as separate economic actors. Id. The physicians in Bolt were 
members of the defendant hospitals' medical staffs who practiced medicine in their individual capacities; we held that the joint 
action of the physicians and the hospitals -- in denying Bolt privileges -- was not a unilateral act and that such action subjected 
them to scrutiny under section 1 of the Sherman Act. The facts of Bolt are strikingly similar to those in the present case. Here, 
the physicians are separate economic actors; thus, their actions are legally distinct from the hospital's actions. Accordingly, the 
district court could not properly base its summary judgment on the ground that the radiologists and DCH were a single legal 
entity. "
343,14," The district court held that the radiologists were insulated from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. We have 
serious doubts about the application of that doctrine to this case. HN4[
] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes from 
antitrust liability anticompetitive activity that consists of petitioning a governmental agency to obtain favorable legislation. This 
doctrine is premised on the need to protect the first amendment right to petition the government from censure by the antitrust 
laws and the belief that the Sherman Act is concerned with economics and not with politics. See 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 204b, at 46 (1978). The present case does not clearly involve the type of lobbying activity or political 
discourse generally protected by the first amendment. Rather, it involves activity that is more economic than political in nature. 
Thus, we decline to rely on this doctrine to affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the radiologists. "
344,15," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
345,16," This struggle has been compared with ""the struggle of common-law judges to articulate a precise definition of the concept of 
'proximate cause.'"" Associated General, 459 U.S. at 535-36, 103 S. Ct. at 907."
345,17," Section 7 of the Clayton Act proscribes mergers whose effect on competition ""may be substantially to lessen competition, or to 
tend to create a monopoly."" 15 U.S.C. § 18 (1988)."
345,18," The plaintiffs in Brunswick also sought ""a divestiture order, an injunction against future acquisitions, and such 'other further 
and different relief' as might be appropriate under § 16 of the [Clayton] Act."" 429 U.S. at 481, 97 S. Ct. at 693. "
346,19," The Supreme Court specifically rejected the ""target area"" test that had previously been used in this circuit.  Associated 
General, 459 U.S. at 536 n. 33, 103 S. Ct. at 907 n. 33 (rejecting test as described by Pan-Islamic Trade Corp., 632 F.2d at 546-
47; Jeffrey, 518 F.2d at 1131). But see Amey, 758 F.2d at 1496 (continuing to use the ""target area"" test)."
346,20," The Court's approach in Associated General has bred much confusion in the lower federal courts. See M. Fordadas, Private 
Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws (Practising Law Institute No. B4-6829 1988); see also Amey, 758 F.2d at 1495 n. 4 
(presenting the various approaches of the circuit courts of appeals). In Associated General, the antitrust injury issue was 
dispositive of the case; that the Court went on to discuss other factors suggested that antitrust injury was not a separate 
threshold question, but was, instead, one of several factors to be balanced when determining antitrust standing. As stated 
earlier, however, Cargill has clarified that antitrust injury is a necessary component of antitrust standing. Thus, the discussion of 
factors beyond antitrust injury in Associated General is best viewed as dicta. This dicta was adopted by the Court in Cargill as 
the second part of antitrust standing analysis. "
347,21," For the text of section 16 of the Clayton Act, see supra note 10."
347,22," As the Court explained, ""one injunction is as effective as 100, and, concomitantly, . . . 100 injunctions are no more effective 
than one."" Cargill, 479 U.S. at 111 n. 6, 107 S. Ct. at 490 n. 6 (quoting Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. at 261, 92 S. Ct. at 891). "
348,23," We recognize that all markets for physicians' services are somewhat restricted because of licensing requirements and that the 
prices charged in these markets are higher than they might be if these requirements did not exist. When we discuss 
supercompetitive profits we mean the profits earned in comparison to what would be earned if the market for providing CT scans 
operated without illegal restrictions to entry imposed on qualified physicians; competitive profits are those profits that would be 
earned when all qualified physicians competed freely."
348,24," Dr. Todorov's practice is very successful. He testified that he works well over 40 hours a week in his neurology practice, 
sometimes up to 14 hours a day."
348,25," This travel would create additional costs for Dr. Todorov beyond the obvious costs associated with the time required for travel. 
Each procedure performed on a CT scan machine at DCH must be scheduled in advance. Many times this schedule is 
unexpectedly disrupted; this occurs because of delays associated with performing a particular CT scan or emergencies that 
require the use of a CT scan machine. Thus, on occasion, Dr. Todorov would travel to the hospital to perform a scheduled CT 
scan and be forced to wait for the machine to become available. This waiting time would add to his cost of performing a CT 
scan. Furthermore, since Dr. Todorov would not be at his office, he would be unable to use this waiting period to perform other, 
profitable work. "
349,26," If Dr. Todorov entered into such an agreement, he would have to ensure that every other physician who was granted radiology 
privileges also joined in the agreement. Once one physician decided to cut prices and competition ensued, Dr. Todorov would be 
driven from the market."
349,27," It is possible that Dr. Todorov would be a more efficient provider of CT scan services for his patients than the radiologists and 
that he would be able to make a profit if he charged them a competitive price for this service. This would mean that a portion of 
Dr. Todorov's damages equalled the competitive profits he lost because he was unable to provide CT scan services to his 
patients. Dr. Todorov, however, has not limited his damages claim to this small sliver of potential lost profits; nor does he present 
his argument in this way. Furthermore, it is doubtful that his proof of such limited damages could ever amount to more than mere 
speculation. "
350,28," In cases where the per se rule applies, such as horizontal price-fixing cases, the only inquiry is whether there was an 
agreement to restrain trade, since the unreasonableness of the restraint is presumed. See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Medical Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 47 
S. Ct. 377, 71 L. Ed. 700 (1927)."
350,29," The defendants in Bolt were hospitals and members of their medical staffs. The medical staff members were not employees of 
the hospitals but were physicians who practiced medicine in their individual capacities; each was a ""separate economic entity 
potentially in competition with other physicians."" Bolt, 891 F.2d at 819. "
351,30," For example, we have recognized the theory of conscious parallelism. Conscious parallelism is uniform business conduct by 
competitors that permits a court to infer the existence of a conspiracy between these competitors. See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, 
Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 221, 59 S. Ct. 467, 472, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939). The idea behind this theory is that 
competitors' parallel business decisions are probative of the existence of a conspiracy between these competitors. The evidence 
used to support this theory is circumstantial. To ensure that we do not punish unilateral conduct, however, we require more than 
mere evidence of parallel conduct by competitors to support an inference of a conspiracy; an agreement is properly inferred from 
conscious parallelism only when ""plus factors"" exist. See id. at 222-23, 59 S. Ct. at 472-73. For example, it is well settled in this 
circuit that evidence of conscious parallelism does not permit an inference of conspiracy unless the plaintiff establishes that, 
assuming there is no conspiracy, each defendant engaging in the parallel action acted contrary to its economic self-interest. See 
Pan-Islamic Trade Corp., 632 F.2d at 559. Furthermore, these ""plus factors"" only create a rebuttable presumption of a 
conspiracy which the defendant may defeat with his own evidence; this further ensures that unilateral or procompetitive conduct 
is not punished or deterred. See Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 225-26, 59 S. Ct. at 474. This theory is unavailable to Dr. Todorov 
because DCH and the radiologists are not competitors in any market and both DCH and the radiologists acted in favor of their 
own economic interests in this case."
351,31," If the number of physicians permitted to perform these services -- and the competition among them -- increased, the fees they 
could obtain for these services would decrease (a straightforward application of the law of supply and demand). "
352,32," Dr. Todorov presented evidence that DCH once offered the radiologists a contract for the exclusive rights to perform and 
interpret radiological procedures at DCH. This evidence is not helpful to his cause. First, it does not reveal DCH's interests at the 
time of the denial of his application for privileges. Clearly, such a contract between DCH and the radiologists would give DCH a 
reason to help the radiologists further their goals; the terms of the contract would presumably benefit DCH and make it rational 
for DCH to deny privileges to other qualified radiologists. We, however, address a situation devoid of any contractual obligations 
and benefits resulting from the exclusion of qualified radiologists. Furthermore, the analysis is different in a case involving an exclusive contract between a hospital and the hospital's medical 
staff, because in that situation there is explicit evidence of an agreement between the defendants and there is, possibly, another 
relevant market (the market for employment by physicians). See, e.g., Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 
29-31, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1567-68, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984); Oltz v. St. Peter's Community Hosp., 861 F.2d 1440, 1446-48 (9th 
Cir.1988). In the present case, with no exclusive contract between DCH and the radiologists, we must analyze the facts more 
carefully to determine first whether any agreement exists; only if we find an agreement do we consider the effects on competition 
and consumers. "
353,33, To engage in a conspiracy in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act is to commit a felony. See 15 U.S.C. § 1.
353,34," Dr. Todorov, although conceding that the hospital's board of directors makes the final decision on applications for privileges, 
argues that the board merely ""rubber stamps"" the recommendation of the medical staff. As proof of this contention, he points to 
the deposition testimony of the hospital administrator, James H. Ford, that he did not recall any applicant for privileges who, after 
securing a favorable recommendation from the credentials or executive committees of the medical staff, had been turned down 
by the board. Dr. Todorov has, however, ignored that part of Mr. Ford's testimony where he states that ""there has [sic] been a 
number of times that the board has reviewed privilege recommendations and have [sic] sent them back for reconsideration. . . . 
The board has not accepted every recommendation made by the credentials committee."" Thus, the hospital's board does more "
354,," than simply ""rubber stamp"" the recommendations of the medical staff. That the board is likely to follow the recommendations of 
the medical staff does not establish, or even reasonably suggest, the existence of a conspiracy. The plaintiff's argument 
eviscerates the agreement requirement of section 1."
354,35," In addition to the section 2 monopolization claim, Dr. Todorov alleges in count two of his complaint that DCH and the 
radiologists conspired to monopolize the market ""for CT scans of the head"" and that they denied his application for privileges to 
further this conspiracy. HN21[
] To establish a conspiracy to monopolize, a plaintiff is required to prove: (1) concerted action 
deliberately entered into with the specific intent of achieving a monopoly; and (2) the commission of at least one overt act in 
furtherance of the conspiracy. See American Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 762 F.2d 1569, 1579 n. 8 (11th Cir.1985); see also L. 
Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 132-34 (1977). Thus, a section 1 claim and a section 2 conspiracy to monopolize 
claim require the same threshold showing -- the existence of an agreement to restrain trade. See R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An 
Economic Perspective 216 (1976) (""As for conspiracy to monopolize, any such conspiracy is also a conspiracy in restraint of 
trade, which violates section 1.""). After this showing is made, then the plaintiff is required, under section 2, to show that the 
conspiracy was formed with the specific intent to obtain or maintain a monopoly. Here, however, as shown above in part II.B.1., 
Dr. Todorov has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a conspiracy between DCH and the 
radiologists. Because of this failure, Dr. Todorov cannot maintain his section 2 conspiracy claim; it is unnecessary to conduct the 
specific intent analysis that is peculiar to a section 2 conspiracy claim. "
355,36," Immunity is also available to private parties under the progeny of Parker if they are actively supervised by the state.  California 
Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). When the defendant 
is a local governmental entity, however, there is no requirement that the defendant be actively supervised by the state in order to 
enjoy the protection of Parker. Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 47, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. "
356,37," It would be incorrect to argue that DCH, as a political subdivision of the state, is also an agent of the state and, thus, is 
protected directly by Parker. A political subdivision is not the same as an agency. For example, in title 4 of the Alabama Code, a 
political subdivision is defined, for purposes of that chapter, as ""any municipality, city, town, or county."" Ala.Code § 4-6-2 (1981). 
None of these entities is an agent of the state, at least not for Parker purposes. Additionally, title 22, chapter 21 of the Alabama 
Code, defines ""person"" as including a political subdivision of the state and any state agency, indicating a distinction between the 
two entities. See Ala.Code § 22-21-260(8) (1990). Thus, DCH must rely on Town of Hallie to be immunized from the antitrust 
laws. "
357,38," This requirement is applicable to both substantive and procedural due process claims. See Nolin v. Douglas County, 903 F.2d 
1546, 1554 (11th Cir.1990); Thompson v. Bass, 616 F.2d 1259, 1264 (5th Cir.1980) (citing Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 350, 
96 S. Ct. 2074, 2080, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976); Megill v. Board of Regents, 541 F.2d 1073, 1081 (5th Cir.1976)). "
358,39," It might be argued that Dr. Todorov has a property interest right in the standards themselves. This would mean that the 
decision not to use the established standards could occur only if due process was afforded. We first note that this is not the 
claim in this case. Further, it appears this argument must fail. The Supreme Court has, in effect, addressed Dr. Todorov's argument in a line of cases addressing state prisoners' claims that 
they have a protected ""liberty"" interest by virtue of procedural provisions in the state parole release statute and regulations. In 
Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51, 103 S. Ct. 1741, 1748, 75 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1983), the Court stated that process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a 
legitimate claim of entitlement. . . . The State may choose to require procedures for reasons other than protection against 
deprivation of substantive rights, of course, but in making that choice the State does not create an independent substantive 
right. (Citations and footnote omitted.) In Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471, 103 S. Ct. 864, 871, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983), the Court held that the creation of procedural guidelines to channel the decisionmaking of prison officials is . . . a salutary development. . . . 
The adoption of such procedural guidelines, without more, suggests that it is these restrictions alone, and not those federal 
courts might also impose under the Fourteenth Amendment, that the State chose to require. Other courts have held that only when the procedural requirements are intended to impose significant substantive restrictions on 
the decisionmakers' discretion would the individual acquire a protected interest. See Skeets v. Johnson, 816 F.2d 1213 (8th 
Cir.1987) (en banc); Weinstein v. University of Illinois, 811 F.2d 1091, 1097-98 & n. 5 (7th Cir.1987) (""procedural protections are 
not themselves property""); Hogue v. Clinton, 791 F.2d 1318, 1324 (8th Cir.1986); Goodisman v. Lytle, 724 F.2d 818, 820-21 (9th 
Cir.1984). Notable is the observation of the Seventh Circuit that constitutionalizing every state procedural right would stand any due process analysis on its head. Instead of identifying the 
substantive interest at stake and then ascertaining what process is due to the individual before he can be deprived of that 
interest, the process is viewed as a substantive end in itself. The purpose of a procedural safeguard, however, is the 
protection of a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.  Shango v. Jurich, 681 F.2d 1091, 1101 (7th Cir.1982). In the present case, Dr. Todorov's claim is equivalent to the prisoners' claims in Olim and Hewitt. The procedures at DCH are 
designed to put some order into the application process to ensure that the hospital's board receives thoughtful and fair 
recommendations from the medical staff. This, in turn, helps the hospital's board make proper decisions. This does not, 
however, convert the additional privileges Dr. Todorov seeks into protected property interests."
358,40," For example, in Leis v. Flynt, 439 U.S. 438, 99 S. Ct. 698, 58 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1979) (per curiam), the Supreme Court held that 
lawyers licensed to practice law in one state do not have a liberty or property interest in appearing pro hac vice in another state 
and, thus, declined to inquire as to whether a state trial judge had made an arbitrary decision in refusing to accept the attorneys' 
pro hac vice applications. "
359,41," The denial of Dr. Todorov's application for privileges is not, in and of itself, a stigma. Indeed, Dr. Todorov alleges that he was 
found by the medical staff's credentials committee to be competent but that he was denied staff privileges for some other reason. 
We cannot presume stigmatization; Dr. Todorov has failed to present evidence showing that he was stigmatized. "
364,1," Under a ""unit"" agreement a rail company agrees to devote an entire train to the transportation of a given product, rather than 
individual box cars."
364,2, It is pointed out that these events occurred over a five-year period beginning in 1982. 
379,1," Although the relevant product market described in Ashkanazy's complaint does not explicitly distinguish between retail and 
institutional sales, (see Complaint para. 10 (""The relevant product market is the manufacture and sale of Kosher for Passover 
food products, sold by the parties to both retail stores and institutions and hence to the ultimate consuming public"")), the 
complaint does divide the market into these two components when asserting Rokeach's market share, claiming that Rokeach 
has 75 to 80 percent of the institutional markets and 40 percent of the retail market (id. para. 15). In his response to Rokeach's 
summary judgment motion, moreover, Ashkanazy speaks more directly of the institutional market as distinct from the retail one 
(Plaintiff's Memorandum at 2). "
380,2," Although Ashkanazy makes several references in his filings to a completed monopoly, his complaint states a cause of action 
only with respect to attempted monopolization, and the argumentation in his memorandum is geared exclusively toward 
establishing the offense of attempt. "
381,3," Professors Areeda and Turner criticize this difference, arguing that proof of intent beyond intent to perform the anticompetitive 
act ""is not part of the completed offense [and] . . . should play no role in an attempt offense."" That a defendant may be of pure 
heart and soul, they continue, ""tells us little about whether the consequences, actual or prospective, are the kind society need 
fear."" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra p. 7, para. 822, at 316. But both Seventh Circuit and Supreme Court precedent recognize 
a difference between intent for attempt purposes and intent for monopolization purposes. This distinction, moreover, is 
justifiable: intention to do wrong can more readily be inferred from the performance of bad acts when a firm has actual monopoly 
power than when it does not. Alternatively, a ""strict liability"" standard is more appropriate when monopoly status has already 
been reached, for the effects on competition are less speculative (dangerous probability is not tantamount to certainty)."
381,4," Ashkanazy proffers evidence of specific intent in both the institutional market and the retail market and additionally provides 
some evidence that applies equally to both markets. Where necessary, we take care to note precisely which market is implicated 
when discussing each piece of evidence in light of Ashkanazy's claim (and Rokeach's concession for purposes of this motion) 
that these two markets are separate."
381,5," Because Ashkanazy only supplied this court with selective portions of Rabbi Tarkieltaub's deposition, the identity of the other 
parties engaged in these conversations is not clear. It appears from the context, however, that Kralstein was speaking with other 
officers of Rokeach and/or Central Kosher, and that Rabbi Tarkieltaub was present but did not actively participate."
381,6," The redacted version of Schiff's deposition that Ashkanazy offers this court prevents us from ascertaining the exact position 
that Schiff held with Central Kosher. It appears, however, that he was some sort of sales representative. [**15] "
382,7," Schiff asserts in his deposition that Ashkanazy did not have leukemia (Schiff Dep. at 167), but this statement is not sufficient to 
raise a material issue on this point. Ashkanazy, the actual patient, testified that he had been told he had ""lymphoma, leukemia 
and [possibly] Hodgkin's disease"" (Ashkanazy Dep. at 165), and, given the charge of deceptive representation on the part of 
Rokeach, it would not be in Ashkanazy's interest to claim an illness that was not believed to exist. No rational jury could credit 
Schiff's testimony. Even if Schiff's statement were considered to raise a material issue and Rokeach's zealous efforts to disseminate the news of 
Ashkanazy's ill health were exclusionary acts, moreover, these statements had no effect whatever on the vigor of competition in 
the Kosher-for-Passover market; Ashkanazy admits that neither Horowitz-Margareten nor Seasons Products were induced to 
drop Ash as a result of Rokeach's revelations (see Ashkanazy Dep. at 163, 167). These statements did not, therefore, contribute 
to any dangerous probability of successful monopolization. See infra p. 20. "
383,8," Tarkieltaub actually spoke of ""suppliers"" in the plural, but his answer to the question ""what else"" (what other suppliers) was not 
supplied by Ashkanazy. We therefore only consider this evidence with respect to Horowitz-Margareten. "
384,9," Rokeach asks this court to strike para. 10 of Ashkanazy's affidavit on the grounds that it lacks a proper foundation and 
constitutes hearsay.  Because we find Ashkanazy's claim of bribes and secret dealings to be nonmeritorious, however, we 
decline to rule on this motion."
384,10," Gluck is certainly the principal with respect to his company, Econocare, and we do not consider the possibility that Gluck and 
Econocare are fiduciaries of the nursing homes that Econocare serves, for Ashkanazy never raises this argument. Even if we 
were to find a fiduciary relationship in this respect, however, there is no showing that Rokeach supplied the free goods in an 
attempt to influence Econocare's conduct, a necessary element of the bribery offense. Moreover, the record is devoid of "
385,," evidence indicating that these gifts to Gluck in fact influenced his behavior, and therefore the link between the arguably 
anticompetitive act and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power is lacking. See infra [slip op.] p. 20."
385,11," Tarkieltaub's response to the question of what products other than matzo were supplied to Ash by Horowitz-Margareten was 
not provided to this court: Q: I don't understand the last part. They attempted to get Mr. Ash to raise his prices? A: No, Mr. Ash's suppliers. Q: And who were those suppliers? A: Horowitz Margareten. Q: Is that on matzohs? A: That's on matzoh products. Q: What else? [next seven pages omitted] (Tarkieltaub Dep. at 61). We assume, then, that Rokeach's cost-raising scheme affects only Horowitz-Margareten's matzo products. "
386,12," In an affidavit and report compiled in connection with the Mrs.  Adler's litigation, Professor Mueller of the University of 
Wisconsin economics department defines gefilte fish as an independent market. This representation has no bearing on the 
current litigation, however, in which no specific submarket has been identified."
386,13," In American Academic Suppliers, the Seventh Circuit announced that recoupment is not possible unless the defendant has 
monopoly power, which the court defined as ""the power to charge a price higher than the competitive price without inducing so 
rapid and great an expansion of output from competing firms as to make the supracompetitive price untenable."" At 1319. The 
context and subsequent discussion make clear, however, that the court envisions an inquiry not only into whether the predator 
can keep rivals out during the period of supracompetitive pricing but also into whether the predator's below-cost pricing will 
eliminate rivals from the market."
386,14," A second interrogatory, Number 11, touches on the subject of the predatory pricing scheme alleged in para. 19(a) of 
Ashkanazy's complaint, but Ashkanazy's response to that interrogatory is limited to the institutional context. See infra p. 32 & 
n.19. Ashkanazy's answer to Interrogatory Number 9, then, represents the extent of the alleged predatory pricing with respect to 
the retail independent market.  [**35] "
388,15," Professor Mueller identifies three potential suppliers for Kosher-for-Passover food other than Rokeach and Manischewitz: Mrs. 
Adler's, Streit's, and Horowitz-Margareten (Mueller Rep. at 8). Although the latter was acquired by Manischewitz in 1986, 
Ashkanazy indicates that he continues to buy Horowitz-Margareten products from Manischewitz (Ashkanazy Aff. at para. 3(a))."
388,16," Although Rokeach's calculations of Ashkanazy's pre-1983 net profit level encompass all Kosher foods, not only the Kosher-
for-Passover foods at issue here, Ashkanazy's estimation in his affidavit documenting decreasing unit sales appears to take all 
of his sales into consideration, which would include ""sundry items"" (see Ashkanazy Dep. at 12). Both figures are therefore 
imperfect for the purposes of this action, but the affidavit data is even more overinclusive. "
389,17," Ashkanazy originally stated that 2/3 of his 1980 profits were attributable to Kosher sales, but he backed away from this figure 
upon further questioning (Ashkanazy Dep. at 519-21)."
389,18," This deposition testimony is contradicted by a statement in Ashkanazy's affidavit claiming that he had the ""ability and the 
interest to expand in the Kosher for Passover market and still keep up reasonable profit margins"" (Ashkanazy Aff. para. 6). 
Because Ashkanazy has not shown that he was confused when he made the deposition statement or that he has uncovered 
new evidence that accounts for the change in position, we must disregard the contradicting affidavit. See Rubin v. Rudolf Wolff 
Commodity Brokers, Inc., 636 F. Supp. 258, 262 (N.D. Ill. 1986)."
389,19," Rokeach's Interrogatory Number 9 also seeks information about the predatory pricing scheme alleged in para. 19 of the 
complaint, but Ashkanazy's response there refers only to Rokeach's pricing policies in the retail market. See supra [slip op.] p. 
24 & n.14. The response to Interrogatory Number 11, therefore, defines the limits of the alleged predatory pricing scheme in the 
institutional market. "
391,20," The term ""commerce,"" for the purposes of the Robinson-Patman Act, connotes interstate commerce. See Borden Co. v. 
Federal Trade Comm'n, 339 F.2d 953, 955 (7th Cir. 1964)."
391,21," By contrast, if the victim is a disfavored buyer of the defendant's goods, alleging a secondary-line injury, the ""in commerce"" 
inquiry is limited to an examination of ""the defendant's sales to the victim and the victim's competitors."" 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
supra p. 36, para. 233c, at 248-49."
391,22," In his memorandum in opposition to Rokeach's motion, Ashkanazy offers New Jersey as the point of origin of Rokeach's 
goods but does not refer to any evidence directly supporting this assertion. Nevertheless, we accept this representation, for 
Rokeach does not claim that the point of origin of its goods is in dispute and indeed admits that its products are sold in interstate 
commerce (Answer to Complaint para. 12) and that its principal place of business is in New Jersey (Halpert Affidavit para. 3)."
391,23," The goods at issue in Standard Oil were stored in anticipation of ultimate demand in Michigan, which was fairly constant and 
could be accurately estimated; there is some indication that this correlation between goods stored and future orders was a factor 
in the Court's conclusion that the flow of commerce was not interrupted. But even if storage for general inventory purposes 
defeats a claim of an interstate transaction, Rokeach has not clearly asserted that its goods were stored for general inventory 
purposes in Illinois and certainly has adduced no evidence supporting such an assertion. "
392,24," Until July, 1989, when Rokeach gained control of all of Central Kosher's outstanding stock, Rokeach owned 60% of the voting 
stock of Central Kosher and 50% of the ownership stock."
392,25," Rabbi Tarkieltaub testified that Rokeach bought Central Kosher so that it could do its ""own distributions as opposed to having 
somebody else independent of them distribute their products"" and that he had no authority over pricing decisions, which were 
made by Irwin Kralstein (Tarkieltaub Dep. at 26-27, 29). Central Kosher, Tarkieltaub continued, did what Rokeach decided it 
should do; indeed, officers of Rokeach visited Central Kosher's headquarters on average twice monthly to set prices and ""to tell 
us what to do"" (id. at 30). "
393,26," Direct evidence of predatory intent comprises ""smoking gun""-type proof, such as statements and letters that expressly 
document malevolent purpose. See Henry, 809 F.2d at 1344. Predatory intent may also be proved indirectly from the 
defendant's conduct (extended unprofitable pricing) and the surrounding circumstances (high concentration and entry barriers). 
See id.; W.H. Brady, 659 F. Supp. at 1377."
393,27," A.A. Poultry clearly does hold that the primary-line liability standard for predatory pricing under the Robinson-Patman Act is 
broader than the Sherman Act standard, without attempting precisely to delineate the difference. This court expressed a contrary 
view in Jays Foods, Inc. v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 843 (N.D. Ill. 1987), which opinion was affirmed and adopted by the 
Seventh Circuit in an unpublished order.  860 F.2d 1082 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1014, 103 L. Ed. 2d 188, 109 S. 
Ct. 1125 (1989). We do not know whether ""adoption"" of a published district court opinion by an unpublished order puts it on a 
special footing or whether it carries no more weight than a lower court decision that, for whatever reason, has been affirmed. 
See Estate of Warner v. United States, 743 F. Supp. 551, 556 (N.D. Ill. 1990). We do know it was not cited in A.A.  Poultry, and 
the A.A. Poultry opinion was not circulated pursuant to Circuit Rule 40(f).  [**63] "
397,28," In his answer to this interrogatory, Ashkanazy claims that three nursing homes were the victims of Rokeach's illegal tie-in. One 
of those homes, Wilton House Nursing Home, was not mentioned by Ashkanazy in his deposition, and the possibility of lost 
sales to that home remains. "
398,29," Ashkanazy supplements this answer in his memorandum in opposition to Rokeach's motions, arguing that Rokeach also 
interfered with Ash's exclusive distributorship arrangement with Horowitz-Margareten. This added allegation, however, goes 
beyond the scope of Ashkanazy's answer to the interrogatory, and we do not consider it. "
399,30," Rokeach argues that it did not interfere with Ash's prospective advantage because Ash lost the four nursing homes when they 
joined Econocare. But because member homes can continue to purchase from independent suppliers after joining Econocare, 
Rokeach selling through Econocare is still competing with Ash; any improper means used by Rokeach to secure a position with 
Econocare or to win customers through Econocare therefore may constitute interference."
399,31," Although Ashkanazy's tying claim remains in the suit as well, the alleged tie-in was limited to three homes: Wilton House 
Nursing Home, Glenview Terrace Nursing Home, and Sherwin Manor Nursing Home (Ashkanazy Ans. to Int. No. 22). 
Ashkanazy asserts interference with prospective advantage with respect to three different homes (Ashkanazy Ans. to Int. No. 
23)."
399,32," Ashkanazy's complaint also cites para. 312 of chapter 121 1/2, which is part of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. To 
the extent that Ashkanazy intended to state a cause of action under that Act, the claim is dismissed, for the Deceptive Trade 
Practices Act provides only for injunctive relief, plus costs and attorneys' fees, see Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 313 (1989); 
Jays Foods, Inc. v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 664 F. Supp. 364, 367 (N.D. Ill. 1987), aff'd, 860 F.2d 1082 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 
1014, 103 L. Ed. 2d 188, 109 S. Ct. 1125 (1989), and Ashkanazy's complaint seeks monetary damages. "
400,33," The alleged disparaging remarks made regarding Mrs. Adler's line of gefilte fish, Rokeach claims, represented merely an 
opinion rather than a misrepresentation and as such are not actionable under the Consumer Fraud Act. Because we find that 
Ashkanazy has failed to assert that this remark injured consumers generally, however, we do not reach that argument. "

designation."

414,*," Honorable Jesse E. Eschbach, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation. "
415,1," LJS' food sales to its franchisees account for only a small percentage of LJS' total yearly profits; LJS makes most of its money 
from sales to the public by the shoppes it owns and from franchise royalties, which amount to a percentage of the franchisees' 
gross sales. For example, the district court found that from 1981-1986, sales to the public accounted for approximately 82% of 
LJS' gross profits and franchise royalties accounted for 13%. In comparison, sales of food supplies to franchisees comprised 
only 4% of LJS' gross profits during this time; frozen cod sales accounted for only 0.58% of LJS' profits."
415,2," The franchise agreements provide that LJS can terminate a franchise if the franchisee serves a brand of food that is not on the 
approved list. "
416,3," In servicing its other accounts, M-B usually takes title to the food it stores and resells it to the restaurants for its own profit. M-B, 
however, prides itself on its willingness to customize its services to the needs of its clients. For LJS, M-B was willing to act as a 
bailee; LJS purchases, finances, insures, and collects money for the food it sells to the franchisees."
416,4," M-B estimates its total costs and the number of cases of food it will deliver by projecting the previous year's figures into the next 
year. Total cost includes the cost of investments in capital necessary to service LJS' account."
416,5, The record is unclear as to when LJS pays M-B.
416,6," For example, if in the previous year M-B actually garnered less revenue than it negotiated to receive, the pay schedule for the 
next year would overvalue the fee per case so that M-B could recoup the revenue it lost. The parties also would make downward 
adjustments in the fee for each case of food delivered if M-B earned greater revenue than LJS and M-B had anticipated."
416,7," Indeed, the record shows that, price and quality of the cod supplied being equal, franchisees preferred the weekly delivery 
service M-B provided for LJS products over the service of other suppliers. LJS' competitors, who were providing less supplies to 
the shoppes, could only afford to offer monthly delivery service. This aggravated storage and ordering problems for those 
franchisees who purchased their cod from these suppliers; it also required large investments in inventory. See infra, slip opinion 
pp. 2314-2316. Thus, M-B's weekly delivery service was valuable to LJS and was envied by LJS' competitors. "
417,8," Indeed, the plaintiffs have alleged that it was impossible for them to employ a delivery service that was as reliable as M-B. M-B 
targeted a measured service level of 99.2%, meaning that on the average 992 out of 1000 cases would be delivered properly 
(i.e., no damage, correct supplies). According to M-B's expert, the industry average was a measured service level of 90-95%."
417,9," The record demonstrates that only one of the plaintiffs in this action, Seagood, asked M-B, in October 1982, to provide weekly 
delivery service for its cod to the shoppes, and that this was an isolated event. In 1980 and 1981, the president of Quality Cod 
Products (QCP), a wholesale competitor of LJS, also requested that M-B provide weekly delivery service for its products to the 
franchised shoppes. QCP is not a party to this action."
417,10," In 1980, QCP's cod cost 30 to 40 cents per pound less than LJS'."
417,11," LJS offered Caribou 20 cents more per pound of cod than QCP had previously paid. This still made the Caribou cod cheaper 
than the Scandinavian cod for LJS. "
418,12," M-B's president, Herb Heller, stated in an affidavit that prior to 1980 there was an 80-case minimum requirement imposed by 
M-B on each franchisee for deliveries of LJS products. This was done so that M-B could keep its trucks full and thus reduce the 
cost of delivering each case. No surcharge was developed to enforce this requirement, and, in fact, it was seldom enforced."
418,13," Surcharges ranged from $ 20 to $ 40 per delivery. For example, a small order of under 50 cases would garner a total 
surcharge of $ 40."
418,14," The Seagood Trading Corporation and its parent, Seagood Seafood, Inc., are both plaintiffs in this action. We refer to them 
collectively as Seagood."
418,15," According to the plaintiffs' complaint, all activity performed by LJS was also performed by its parent company, Jerrico, Inc., 
also named as a defendant in this case. For ease of discussion, we attribute Jerrico's actions to LJS throughout this opinion; our 
analysis of the claims involving LJS is equally applicable to the claims against Jerrico, unless specifically noted."
418,16," In 1984, Caribou merged with Fishery Products, Inc. (Fishery), a Canadian business that sells fish, including cod, that is 
packed by its parent company. The plaintiffs alleged that Fishery, before this merger, was a participant in the alleged 
anticompetitive conspiracy; they did not, however, make Fishery a party defendant."
418,17," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, that HN1[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, that HN2[
] ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" Id. § 2."
418,18," These sections of the Clayton Act authorize private actions for violations of the antitrust laws. Section 4 authorizes a private 
action for treble damages and provides, in pertinent part, that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by "
419,," reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor."" Id. § 15(a). Section 16 authorizes a private action for 
injunctive relief, and provides, in pertinent part, that ""any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and 
have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by 
a violation of the antitrust laws."" Id. § 26."
419,19, All references to the plaintiffs' complaint are actually to the plaintiffs' amended complaint.
419,20," For purposes of discussion, we treat cod fillets as the only food supply at issue in this case. Cod storage, delivery, and sales 
represent the bulk of the business at issue. The legal analysis, and the disposition, of counts two and six supplies equally to cod 
and the other food supplies involved."
419,21," The remaining counts did not allege antitrust violations. Counts seven through twelve, brought under the district court's 
pendent jurisdiction, alleged state-law violations. Counts seven through nine, involving S & S's rejection of the Caribou cod it 
purchased from Seagood (as alleged in count five, see infra, slip opinion pp. 2307-2308), contained causes of action against 
LJS, Caribou, and S & S for interference with contractual relations or prospective advantage, breach of contract, and injurious 
falsehood. In counts ten and eleven, the plaintiffs alleged that LJS either induced or coerced M-B and the suppliers of cod on 
LJS' list of approved products not to do business with the plaintiffs and thus committed the tort of interference with prospective 
advantage. Count twelve alleged that UMF breached its contract with Seagood for the sale of cod. Counts thirteen and fourteen contained causes of action under federal and state Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Acts, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)-(d) (1988) and Fla. Stat. § 895.03(3)-(4) (1989), respectively. Count fifteen alleged that 
LJS sold shrimp to the franchisees that did not meet its standards in violation of statutory fair competition, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) 
(1988). Count sixteen alleged that the actions taken by LJS as described in counts thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen constituted 
unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade in violation of Fla. Stat. § 501.204 
(1989)."
419,22," Beginning in March 1982, LJS informed franchisees that they would be guaranteed cod deliveries only if they were buying 
from LJS or had given 30 days notice of an intention to do so. LJS claimed that this plan, recommended by M-B, was necessary "
420,," to ensure that cod would be fairly allocated to LJS' customers in times of shortage. The plaintiffs allege that this explanation is a 
mere pretext."
420,23," Count three also alleged that, in furtherance of this conspiracy, UMF breached its contract with Seagood for the sale of cod."
420,24," According to the plaintiffs, the approved cod supply equals approximately 50% of the total cod supply."
420,25," Several of the defendants also filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs. Caribou filed a counterclaim alleging trademark 
infringement and unfair competition. These claims arose from Seagood's and Falcon's sale of cod packed under the Caribou 
label to several franchisees in Florida in 1982 -- the same transaction outlined in count five of the plaintiffs' complaint. According 
to Caribou, the plaintiffs repacked Caribou's low quality cod (1-3 cod) in boxes marked with counterfeit Caribou labels so that 
they could pass it off as Caribou's high quality cod (1-2 cod); LJS had approved the use of 1-2 cod in the shoppes but not 1-3 
cod. The plaintiffs then sold this mislabeled cod to several franchisees. UMF also filed a counterclaim against the plaintiffs, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract. 
These claims also sprung from repacking schemes allegedly perpetrated by the plaintiffs and from Seagood's refusal to pay for 
46,000 pounds of cod that it purchased from UMF."
420,26," For example, M-B claimed that it turned down the requests LJS' competitors made to have it deliver their food to the shoppes 
because those competitors were not the type of clientele that fit into M-B's successful business formula. M-B's president 
characterized these requests as ""posing the question of whether we wanted to provide essentially a public warehousing and 
common carrier trucking service for a single product sold by a wholesaler that neither owned nor franchised restaurants."" He 
concluded that providing this service would mean a departure from M-B's established business formula. "
421,," The defendants also asserted that some of the plaintiffs' claims were barred by the statute of limitations, that the equitable 
doctrine of ""unclean hands"" barred the plaintiffs' right to injunctive relief and treble damages, and that the plaintiffs had no 
standing to bring the claims alleged in the complaint."
421,27," In early 1985, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the antitrust claims. The district court denied these motions. 
After extensive discovery had been conducted and new Supreme Court cases clarifying the application of summary judgment to 
antitrust cases had been decided, the district court authorized another round of summary judgment motions. By the time these 
new summary judgment motions were filed, Caribou had merged with Fishery, had settled with the plaintiffs, and had been 
dismissed from the action."
421,28," Fed.R. Civ. P. 54(b) states, in pertinent part: HN3[
] When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, . . . or when multiple parties are involved, the court 
may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express 
determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence 
of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision . . . which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or 
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and . . . 
is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment. . . . The plaintiffs argued that it might waste judicial resources to delay their appeal of the dismissal of these claims until after the 
remaining claims were litigated. If the claims against M-B were reinstated on appeal, then a second trial involving essentially the 
same operative facts would be necessary. The district court, finding ""no just reason for delay,"" granted this motion and directed 
the entry of final judgment in favor of M-B."
421,29," The district court adopted, without modification, the report and recommendation of the magistrate, to whom it had referred the 
motions for summary judgment, as its final order. All references herein to the conclusions of law of the district court are therefore 
to the conclusions of the magistrate. "
422,30," As previously noted, sales of supplies to franchisees made up a small part of LJS' total gross profit. See supra note 1. In 
addition, the district court found that LJS' average gross profit margin for the sale of supplies to franchisees decreased from 
5.5% in 1978 to 2.5% in 1986. The average gross profit margin for such sales from 1978 to 1986 was 4%; the average gross 
profit margin for sales of cod to franchisees during this time was 2.81%. This convinced the district court that it was implausible 
that LJS sacrificed higher royalties resulting from sales to the public by franchised shoppes in order to reap higher profits from 
sales of supplies to franchisees."
422,31," The plaintiffs were granted summary judgment with respect to count five of UMF's counterclaim alleging common-law unfair 
competition. "
423,32," As the Supreme Court has explained, ""per HN5[
] se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the 
social utility of particular commercial practices."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50 n. 16, 97 S. Ct.

423,33," To date, HN6[
] the rule of per se illegality has been applied to four categories of restraints: horizontal and vertical price 
fixing, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940); Dr. Miles Medical Co.

424,35," Most of these citations come from the discussion in Construction Aggregate Transp., 710 F.2d at 773-74. "
425,36," See H. Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law 280 (1985) (""The courts' general refusal to apply the per se rule to 
concerted refusals by noncompetitors is wise: agreements between firms that do not compete are far less likely to be 
anticompetitive than agreements of competitors."")."
425,37," HN12[
] In applying the rule of reason, the factfinder takes into account the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; 
[and] the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the 
reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.  Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918)."
425,38," There is evidence in the record to support this assumption. As the district court observed, the record contains evidence 
indicating that: high-level officials at M-B and LJS had continual contact; M-B, on more than one occasion, conferred with LJS 
before deciding to reject competitors of LJS as clients; and M-B performed services for LJS that it did not perform for all of its 
clients and these services could be used to further anticompetitive goals. As noted in the text supra, the district court rejected the 
plaintiffs' count two claim on the ground that M-B's refusal to deal, even if pursuant to an agreement with LJS, constituted 
procompetitive conduct immune from the antitrust laws."
425,39," The district court analyzed the anticompetitive impact of the agreement between LJS and M-B by looking at the market for 
restaurant delivery services. The plaintiffs contend that this is the wrong relevant market; as stated above, they urge us to 
examine this issue in the market for sales of supplies to LJS franchisees. Without passing on the validity of the district court's 
ruling, we will use the plaintiffs' definition of the relevant market."
425,40," As noted earlier, cod is the staple of the shoppes' menu, and the ability to sell cod to the franchised shoppes is the principal 
issue in this action. See supra note 20. "
426,41," The distributors may pass on other costs to the franchisees as well, such as advertising and promotional expenses. "
427,42," The plaintiffs also described their position as follows: ""Martin-Brower provided LJS with a competitive advantage not shared by 
its wholesale competitors."" "
428,43," According to M-B's expert, M-B's share of the market for restaurant delivery services was merely 2.4% in 1984. This gave M-B 
the second largest share of this market; the largest firm had only a 3.2% share of the market."
428,44," Not only do the plaintiffs seek the benefits of LJS' capital outlays, they seek these benefits for free. The plaintiffs are not 
offering to pay LJS for its investment; instead, they want to use M-B's services at the same price LJS pays for them. This would 
result in a windfall for the plaintiffs at LJS' expense -- the plaintiffs would get all of the benefit without any of the cost."
428,45," As Judge Easterbrook eloquently put it: ""Who says that competition is supposed to be fair, that we judge the behavior of the 
marketplace by the ethics of the courtroom?  Real competition is bruising rivalry, in which people go out of business under 
intense pressure . . . . Competition is a 'gale of creative destruction.'"" Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 577 (7th Cir. 
1986) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). "
429,46," According to the plaintiffs, M-B also knew that some of LJS' franchisees, namely S & S, had joined the LJS/cod suppliers 
scheme. This inference cannot reasonably be drawn from the record before us. "
437,1," Plaintiffs are citizens of New Jersey and defendant Merrill Lynch is a Delaware corporation having its principal place of 
business in New York. "
439,2," Because this Court assumes jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, it does not reach the question of 
whether the allegations of the complaint assert a claim arising under the laws of the United States such as would give rise to 
federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331."
439,3," The first cause of action is brought under CPLR 7511(c)(1) and seeks ""correction of judgment by modification."" Complaint

440,4," Pertinent portions of the arbitrators' decision dated December 11, 1989, are provided below: CASE SUMMARY Claimants William T. Hough and Norma P. Hough alleged an improper execution of an order and lack of communication by 
Respondent Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. in the sale of certain bonds from their account. Claimants also alleged, 
inter alia, that Respondent violated the unfair competition and antitrust laws. Respondent maintained, inter alia, that it acted 
properly, that Claimants were contributorily at fault, and that Claimants failed to mitigate damages. RELIEF REQUESTED Claimants requested actual damages of approximately $ 51,103 which amount included their costs and expenses, arbitration 
deposit and attorney's fees. In addition, Claimants requested punitive and treble damages, for a total damage claim of 
approximately $ 3,000,000. Claimants also requested injunctive relief. Respondent requested dismissal of the Statement of 
Claim and its costs and expenses. AWARD On November 2, and 3, 1989, in New York City, the undersigned arbitrators heard the controversy between the parties set forth 
in submissions to the arbitrators signed by Claimants on February 18, 1989 (filed with the MSRB on March 27, 1989) and by 
Respondent on May 19, 1989. The arbitration panel, having considered the pleadings, the testimony and the evidence presented 
at the hearing, has determined in full and final resolution of the issue submitted for determination as follows: Respondent shall pay to Claimants actual damages of $ 17,500. No punitive or treble damages are awarded and no injunctive 
relief is awarded. Each of the parties shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorney's fees. With respect to Claimants 
costs, this shall include all reasonable costs incurred in connection with the appearance of Richard Frangipane at the hearing, 
pursuant to section 22 of MSRB rule G-35. Pursuant to section 2 of MSRB rule A-16, Claimants' $ 1,000 arbitration deposit shall 
be retained by the MSRB as forum fees and, Respondent shall pay to the MSRB $ 1,000 as forum fees. "
441,5," Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that CPLR 7511 is ""analogous to and consistent with corrections and/or modifications available 
under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(a) and for clerical mistakes and/or (b) for mistakes, inadvertence, surprise or 
excusable neglect, fraud, void judgment."" Complaint para. 10. While their complaint asserts that ""plaintiffs bring this Action to 
have the Arbitrator's Decision-judgment modified and thereafter affirmed under New York Statutory grounds as set-forth in and 
under NYS CPL Sec. 7511(c)(1),"" plaintiffs', in their memorandum of law in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, also 
argue for modification pursuant to the Court's powers under Rule 60. Complaint para. 10; Plaintiffs' Memo at 22-25. "
442,6," Complaint paras. 17-18 incorporate Exhibit A by reference. Complaint para. 18 incorporates Exhibit B by reference. Complaint 
para. 23 incorporates Exhibit C by reference. Complaint para. 43 incorporates Exhibit D by reference. Complaint para. 1 
incorporates Exhibit E by reference. Complaint para. 2 incorporates Exhibits F and G by reference."
442,7," These issues having been tendered to them for decision, the panel was obligated to determine them. Whether the arbitrators 
considered themselves authorized to pass upon the antitrust question is neither questioned nor is it clear. It is clear, however, 
that the arbitrators did decide the issue when they determined that they would award neither injunctive relief nor punitive or 
treble damages. Moreover, the arbitration decision in stating that: The arbitration panel, having considered the pleadings, the testimony and the evidence presented at the hearing has 
determined in full and final resolution of the issue submitted for determination as follows . . . . leads this Court to conclude that the arbitration award was a ruling on all claims which were submitted to the arbitrators 
(emphasis provided). See Pallante v. PaineWebber, Jackson & Curtis, Inc., 1985Fed.Sec.L.Rep. para. 92,219 at 91,613, 91,615 
(S.D.N.Y. May 14, 1985) (an arbitration decision which explicitly states that ""all claims are hereby denied"" gives rise to ""a heavy 
presumption that the arbitrators in fact did address all the claims presented in [plaintiff's] statement of claims.""). See also Albin 
Stevedore Co. v. Central Rigging and Contracting Corp., 308 F.2d 347 (9th Cir. 1962) (where subject matter of complaint 
was presented to arbitrators, their award in ""full settlement of all claims submitted"" disposed of the complaint). "
443,," Plaintiffs do not argue against the arbitration of their antitrust claims and would be in no position to do so when, far from wanting 
to reserve such claims for judicial determination, they asked the arbitrators to decide them and award them treble damages. 
 [**23]"
443,8," Plaintiffs have made no claim of denial of due process nor have they alleged that the arbitrators refused to consider their 
claims. In fact, plaintiffs themselves state, ""Arbitrated by the MSRB was the . . . stated federal statutory law of the Fair Trade 
Commission Act."" Plaintiffs' Memo at 15. "
454,1," The Wisconsin Supreme Court explained the rationale for this requirement as follows: HN5[
] The requirement that the conduct be extreme and outrageous reflects our concern with the difficulties surrounding 
proof of the existence of severe emotional harm, and proof of a causal relationship between the injury and the defendant's 
conduct. If the conduct is gross and extreme it is more probable that the plaintiff did, in fact, suffer the emotional distress 
alleged. Moreover, the requirement of extreme and outrageous conduct as a condition of recovery will avoid litigation ""in the 
field of bad manners, where relatively minor annoyances had better be dealt with by instruments of social control other than 
law.""  Alsteen, 21 Wis. 2d at 360, 124 N.W. 2d at 318 (quoting Magruder, Mental and Emotional Disturbance in the Law of Torts, 49 
Harv. L. Rev. 1033, 1035 (1936)). "
455,2," There is some debate between the parties concerning whether plaintiffs' complaint contains a claim for negligent infliction of 
emotional distress. It is true that the heading of the emotional distress count of plaintiffs' complaint is ""CAUSE OF ACTION 
NUMBER ONE: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress."" However, throughout the body of the count, plaintiffs allege both 
intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. See, e.g. paras. 41, 45. "
456,3," At a late stage of this litigation in the district court, plaintiffs indicated that they sought relief as well under Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18. Defendant argues that this claim was not raised in a timely fashion below and that we are 
consequently precluded from considering it on appeal. This issue is mooted by this court's decision in United States v. Rockford 
Memorial Hosp., 898 F.2d 1278 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920, 111 S. Ct. 295, 112 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1990). In that case, we 
observed that, as applied to mergers, the judicial interpretations of § 1 of the Sherman Act (which plaintiffs pleaded and 
preserved for appeal), and § 7 of the Clayton Act (which defendant argues was not raised below), ""have, after three quarters of a 
century, converged."" See id. at 1281-82. "
458,4," Nelson and Bowman have supported their allegation that defendant now possesses inordinate market power with evidence 
presented by an expert witness suggesting that the effect of the merger in the relevant market they propose has been to 
substantially lessen competition through the elimination of a small but significant competitor. See Affidavit of Harold S. Luft at 24-
25 (merger caused Herfindahl indices of competition in market for physician visits in three zip-code area including Monroe to 
increase by over 1,100 to 4,472); compare Department of Justice Merger Guidelines § 3.11(c), reprinted, 4Trade Reg. Rep. 
(CCH) P. 13,103 at 20,561 (Department of Justice is likely to challenge mergers resulting in post-merger Herfindahl index of 
over 1,800 where merger increases Herfindahl index by more than 50). Defendants, as one might expect, describe the relevant market as encompassing a larger area and justify their acquisition by 
pointing to the low barriers to entry into the medical care market and the presence of larger chains of clinics in urban centers 
near Monroe such as Madison, Janesville-Beloit, and Rockford. We do not reach the merits of this aspect of the dispute, which 
the parties are invited to address in the district court through renewed motions for summary judgment."
458,5," Alternatively, one could view the Clinic's refusal to treat Nelson and Bowman as an infinite increase in the price it charges them 
for treatment. This characterization may be particularly relevant in the market for health care, where the price set for treatment is 
often negotiated not between patient and physician but between patient's insurer and physician. The Clinic may thus have been 
unable to charge Nelson and Bowman a higher price for the treatment it provided them to reflect the heightened risk 
(demonstrated by their past behavior) that it would later have to pay to litigate a malpractice case. Unable to bargain for 
compensation for this increased risk in the form of higher fees, the Clinic chose not to treat Bowman and Nelson at all. In a 
competitive market this would not be wrongful, at least absent a concerted refusal by unaffiliated doctors to deal with a past "
459,," malpractice plaintiff. See Williams v. St. Joseph Hosp., 629 F.2d 448, 452 (7th Cir. 1980). In a market made non-competitive by 
a merger, it is the kind of ""price increase"" that is a central concern of the Sherman Act."
459,6," The Supreme Court has indicated that it may soon resolve this conflict. See Pinhas v. Summit Health, 894 F.2d 1024, 1031-32 
(9th Cir. 1989), cert. granted, 496 U.S. 935, 110 S. Ct. 3212, 110 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1990). "
461,7," This does not mean that we will not impose on HN26[
] antitrust plaintiffs the duty to plead all facts likely to be in their 
possession at the time they initiate litigation or subsequently amend their complaint that show the nexus between the 
defendant's challenged conduct and interstate commerce. See Seglin, 769 F.2d at 1283 n.11. Rather, as we anticipated in 
Seglin, ""there may be cases in which all facts supporting the requirement of a nexus with interstate commerce are within the 
defendant's exclusive knowledge."" Id. In those cases, complaints like the one in this case, which do not contain a welter of 
factual detail but do set out a plausible theory as to how defendant's anti-competitive conduct impacted interstate commerce, 
may survive a motion to dismiss. "
477,1," Plaintiff's original application for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction included a claim based on Section 8 of 
the Clayton Act. Plaintiff, however, chose not to pursue that claim at the evidentiary hearing. To the extent an injunction is still 
sought on that claim, it is denied. "
484,1," This matter was originally assigned to the Honorable Alfred J. Lechner, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of New 
Jersey. Judge Lechner handled all preliminary motions and began the hearing on plaintiff's application for a permanent 
injunction on November 13, 1990. Judge Lechner also held proceedings on November 15 and November 19, 1990. On 
November 19, 1990, the Honorable John F. Gerry, Chief Judge of the District of New Jersey reassigned this action from Judge 
Lechner to me. The case had proceeded on the basis of sworn statements which constituted the direct testimony of the parties 
and with live cross examination of certain witnesses. The hearing continued before me on December 3, 1990. Counsel for the 
defendants wished to recall plaintiff's expert witness Dr. David D. Smith for further cross examination. That being done, all 
parties agreed they had no objections to my proceeding to complete the trial and determining the credibility of the witnesses as 
to all issues before the Court. "
485,2," Also known by industry sources as the ""three-outlet channel of distribution""."
485,3," The five top condom brands sold in this market, see infra, include Carter-Wallace's Trojans, Schmid's Ramses and Shiek, 
Ansell's Lifestyles and Allercare/NSL's Protex brand whose acquisition by Schmid is the subject of this dispute. "
489,4," The Guidelines explain: assuming that buyers could respond to an increase in price for a tentatively identified product group only by shifting to other 
products, what would happen? If readily available alternatives were, in the aggregate, sufficiently attractive to enough 
buyers, an attempt to raise price would not prove profitable and the tentatively identified product group would prove too 
narrow. DOJ Merger Guidelines § 2.11 "
492,5," Because we have no occasion to decide the potential illegality of this acquisition under Section 7, there is no need to address 
defendants' claims that NSL was a ""Failing Firm"" or plaintiff's claims that defendants' had failed to satisfy the requirements of 
that defense. "
493,6," Section 16 states in part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, including 
sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity . . . ."
493,15, U.S.C. § 26. (Emphasis supplied).
493,7," As Judge Politan recognized, the analysis for a private plaintiff differs from that which the Court would undertake when the 
United States is the plaintiff and a general public right of action is asserted. Id. (citing Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. 294, 8 L. Ed. 2d 
510, 82 S. Ct. 1502). "
494,8," It is important to note that plaintiff's economic expert, Dr. David Smith, did not address the issue of antitrust injury. The following 
testimony was received at trial: Q: Let me show you your declaration Dr. Smith. Now its true, is it not, sir, that in your declaration, you don't deal with the 
competitive effects of the transaction? Isn't that right? A: No, that's not true. "
495,," Q: But you do not deal with the matter of injury to Ansell, isn't that right? A: I deal with the anticompetitive effects in terms of the increase in concentration and entry difficulties, but I have not dealt with 
the issue of injury to Ansell. . . . . Q: You haven't addressed injury at all in any of your submissions to the Court, isn't that correct? A: I was not asked to address the issue of injury. In the course of doing my analysis, I have seen various documents on the 
subject, but I have not written anything for the corresponding subject. Q: You weren't asked by Ansell to discuss injury, right? A: That's right. Q: And in fact, you didn't discuss injury with Ansell, isn't that right? A: That's right. Q: Now that's pretty revealing, isn't it? I mean, when you were at the Department of Justice, that's what you did, isn't it? You 
analyzed harms, injuries, competitive effects of all kinds of business practices, didn't you? A: When I was at the Department of Justice, I did a lot more than that, and there have been a lot of things that I've done in the 
past that I was not asked to do here. Q: Well, my question wasn't what you did more than that. My question was whether you dealt with that particular matter, the 
matter of injury, of competitive effect or mergers, for example? A: At the Department of Justice, I dealt with the issue of anticompetitive effects for emergents [sic], just as I have here. Q: That's what you do now in your business, isn't that right? A: Often it is, yes. Q: And you consider injuries that arise from mergers, for example? A: I address the issue of anticompetitive effects, not necessarily the injury to any particular firm. Q: You have never, in the work that you're doing now, considered the injuries that may arise out of a transaction, is that right? Is 
that what you're saying? A: Well, when you say injuries, I'm saying, I am saying that I deal with the issue of anticompetitive effect. And as for your legal 
concept of injury, that isn't something that I ordinarily deal with. Trial Transcript, Dec. 3, 1990, at 12-14. "
496,9," It has been stipulated by the parties that Ansell has not in the past been denied retail space because its promotional 
allowances were not attractive or because it could not come up with sufficient rebates to retailers. Additionally, it has been 
stipulated that there is no necessary correlation between the giving of rebates and the quantity of extra shelf space to the 
rebater's products. Rebates are not attractive to retailers unless the products for which the rebates are given are purchased by 
consumers in sufficient quantities to enable the retailers to make additional purchases and receive additional rebates. 
Accordingly, the issue of promotional practices as a form of antitrust injury suffered by Ansell will not be addressed. "
521,1," The Fifth Circuit added two caveats, which the Third Circuit cited in a footnote. First, the action must be brought within four 
years of the injurious act if ""the violation is final at its impact,"" such as ""where the plaintiff's business is immediately and 
permanently destroyed, or where an actionable wrong is by its nature permanent at initiation without further acts."" Imperial Point, 
549 F.2d at 1035 (quoting Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service Corp., 517 F.2d 117, 126-27 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. 
denied, 423 U.S. 1054, 46 L. Ed. 2d 643, 96 S. Ct. 784 (1976)). Second, ""a cause of action will not lie for damages that occur 
within the four years preceding suit, if those damages result solely from acts committed by the defendant outside the four-year 
period."" Id. at 1037 (emphasis added). I note that neither caveat applies here. This is not a case in which defendant's violation 
was a final act nor can it be said that plaintiffs' damages arose solely from prelimitations period acts."
521,2," Indeed, had plaintiffs brought suit earlier defendant certainly would have argued that their future damages were unduly 
speculative. "
535,1," HN3[
] Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 provides, in relevant part: Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes 
to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any 
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, 
suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."
535,42, U.S.C. § 1983 (1988).
535,2," In Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287, 90 S. Ct. 1011 (1970), for example, financial aid recipients whose benefits 
had been terminated without a hearing were found to possess a legitimate claim of entitlement worthy of due process protection. 
Even though the recipients had not demonstrated they were within the terms of statutory eligibility, the Court reasoned that the 
existence of concrete rules to establish entitlement was sufficient to confer upon the applicants a right to a hearing. "
536,3," Those factors are: (1) The character of the neighborhood; (2) the zoning and uses of properties nearby; (3) the suitability of the subject property for the uses to which it has been restricted; (4) the extent to which removal of the restrictions will detrimentally affect nearby property; (5) the length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned; and (6) the relative gain to the public health, safety, and welfare by the destruction of the value of plaintiff's property as 
compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual landowner. Golden, 584 P.2d at 136. "
537,4," Appellants' citation to Littlefield v. Afton, 785 F.2d 596, 602 (8th Cir. 1986), to support its argument that the quasi-judicial 
character of the proceeding significantly and substantially restricts the discretion of the decisionmaker is misplaced. There, the 
court held that an applicant had a protected property interest in a building permit. It based its conclusion, however, on an 
ordinance that required issuance of a permit upon the applicant's compliance with certain conditions. It did not rest its holding on 
the quasi-judicial character of the application process. We also note the following remarks of Justice Stevens: The fact that codes regularly provide a procedure for granting individual exceptions or changes, the fact that such changes 
are granted in individual cases with great frequency, and the fact that the particular code in the record before us 
contemplates that changes consistent with the basic plan will be allowed, all support my opinion that the opportunity to 
apply for an amendment is an aspect of property ownership protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment.  City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enter., Inc., 426 U.S. 668, 682-83, 49 L. Ed. 2d 132, 96 S. Ct. 2358 (1976) (Stevens & Brennan, 
JJ., dissenting). This passage may demonstrate the belief of at least two Justices that the availability of a mechanism to change the zoning of 
property confers upon the landowner a property interest. Even there, however, Justice Stevens recognized that the 
decisionmaker under the ordinance before the Court was required to grant rezoning requests consistent with the common plan. 
No such requirement exists here. As we have already concluded, the city commission's action need only be reasonable. The 
application process does not therefore impose significant substantive restrictions on the commission's action. See Parks v. 
Watson, 716 F.2d 646, 656-57 (9th Cir. 1983). "
538,5," Compare Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, 92 S. Ct. 1983 (1972) (possessory interest of appellants to 
household goods purchased on installment contract sufficient to invoke due process safeguards); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 
593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570, 92 S. Ct. 2694 (1972) (school's de facto tenure policy, arising from rules and understandings officially 
promulgated and fostered, provided the respondent with a sufficient expectancy to confer upon him a right to a requested 
hearing). "
539,6," Appellants ask this court to engage in what they assert to be an exacting rational basis standard set forth by the Supreme 
Court in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313, 105 S. Ct. 3249 (1985). There, the Court 
analyzed a city's regulation of group homes for the mentally retarded. Although the Court in Cleburne declined to recognize the 
mentally retarded as a suspect class, it admonished the city that a desire to harm a politically unpopular group was not a 
legitimate state interest.  Id. at 446-47. Even if we were to read Cleburne to require that laws discriminating against historically 
unpopular groups meet an exacting rational basis standard, however, we do not believe the class in which appellants assert they 
are a member merits such scrutiny."
539,7," The courts are not uniform in their application of the arbitrary and capricious standard in zoning ordinance cases.  RRI Realty, 
870 F.2d at 914 n.1. If the application process is determined to be quasi-judicial, courts require that the articulated basis for the 
decision have a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. See, e.g., Shelton, 780 F.2d at 489 (Burn, Politz, Johnson, 
Williams, JJ., and Tate, C.J., dissenting). If the process is characterized as quasi-legislative, however, the court need only find a 
rational reason upon which the decision could have been based. See, e.g., Spence, 873 F.2d at 261; RRI Realty, 870 F.2d at 
914. We need not determine here which standard should apply to the City of Lawrence rezoning process for the purpose of 
analyzing appellants' substantive due process claim. Nor need we determine whether federal courts should give deference to 
the designation of a procedure as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative by a state court in the face of a constitutional challenge. 
Under either standard, appellants have established neither facts nor argument upon which relief could be granted. "

such city and any unincorporated territory lying outside of the city but within the county in which such city is located, which 
in the opinion of the commission forms the total community of which the city is a part. . . . Such plan or part thereof shall constitute the basis or guide for public action to insure a coordinated and harmonious 
development or redevelopment which will best promote the health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and 
general welfare as well as wise and efficient expenditure of public funds. "
541,, Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 12-704 (1982).
541,12," Because we find the city council's refusal of appellants' request to rezone the subject property shielded by the state action 
immunity doctrine, we do not address the district court's determination that the actions of the appellees are protected under the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965); 
Eastern R.R. Pres. Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961). We note that 
appellants do not allege a conspiracy between the city commission and a private citizen to whom Parker immunity does not 
apply. "
544,1," Section one of the Robinson-Patman is the exception since it expressly amends section two of the Clayton Act. The Clayton 
Act, of course, is included as one of ""the antitrust laws"" in section one of the Clayton Act. See 355 U.S. at 376, citing 49 Stat. 
1526, 15 U.S.C. 13(a). "

585,1," Section § 11344(b)(1) provides: ""HN2[
] In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by 
the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following: ""(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public. ""(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed 
transaction. ""(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction. ""(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction. ""(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region."" "
587,2," On September 9, 1989, the Commission also filed a petition for rehearing, and requested the court to refrain from ruling on the 
petition until the Commission could issue a comprehensive decision on remand addressing issues that the Court of Appeals left "
588,," open for resolution.  On September 29, 1989, the Court of Appeals issued an order stating that the Commission's petition for 
rehearing would be ""deferred pending release of the ICC's decision on remand."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 89-1027, p. 54a. On January 4, 1990, the Commission reopened proceedings in the case remanded to it.  On May 21, 1990, two months after we 
granted the carriers' petitions for certiorari, the Commission issued its remand decision.  CSX Corp. -- Control -- Chessie 
System, Inc. and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., 6 I. C. C. 2d 715 (1990). In its decision, the Commission adhered to the 
Court of Appeals' ruling that § 11341(a) did not authorize it to override provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement.  The 
Commission held, however, that § 11341(a) authorized it to foreclose resort to RLA remedies for modification and enforcement 
of collective-bargaining agreements ""at least to the extent of [its] authority"" to impose labor-protective conditions under § 11347.  
Id., at 754. The Commission explained that the § 11347 limit on its § 11341(a) authority ""reflects the consistency of the overall 
statutory scheme for dealing with CBA modifications required to implement Commission-approved mergers and consolidations."" 
Id., at 722. The Commission remanded its decision to the parties for further negotiation or arbitration. On December 4, 1990, the union respondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of the Commission's remand decision.  
The petition raises three issues: (1) whether § 11341(a) authorizes the ICC to foreclose employee resort to the RLA; (2) whether 
§ 11347 authorizes the ICC to compel employees to arbitrate changes in collective-bargaining agreements; and (3) whether 
abrogation of employee contract rights effected a taking in violation of the Due Process and Just Compensation clauses of the 
Fifth Amendment."
588,3," LEdHN[2B][
] [2B] On May 23, 1990, and again on September 19, 1990, the union respondents filed motions to dismiss the case as moot.  They 
argued that in light of the alternative ground for decision offered by the ICC on remand from the Court of Appeals, see n. 2, 
supra, the meaning and scope of § 11341(a) was no longer material to the dispute.  The union respondents reassert their 
mootness argument in their brief on the merits.  Brief for Respondent Unions 18. We disagree.  The Commission predicated the analysis in its remand order on the correctness of the Court of Appeals' 
interpretation of § 11341(a).  Thus, our definitive interpretation of § 11341(a) may affect the Commission's remand order.  
Agency compliance with the Court of Appeals' mandate does not moot the issue of the correctness of the court's decision.  See, 
e. g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 791, n. 1 (1985); Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 
453 U.S. 34, 42, n. 12 (1981); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 468-469, n. 4 (1977). In addition, the alternative basis offered by the 
Commission on remand does not end the controversy between the parties.  The parties retain an interest in the validity of the "
589,," ICC's original order because the Court of Appeals may again disagree with the Commission's interpretation of the Act in its 
review of the remand order. "
590,4," Section 5(11) of the Transportation Act of 1940 provided: ""Any carriers or other corporations, and their officers and employees and any other persons, participating in a transaction

antitrust laws and all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, Federal, State, or municipal, insofar as may be 
necessary to enable them to carry into effect the transaction so approved or provided for in accordance with the terms and 
conditions, if any, imposed by the Commission. . . ."" The recodification of this language in § 11341(a) effected no substantive change.  See H. R. Rep. No. 95-1395, pp. 158-160 
(1978).  See also ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 299, n. 12 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). "

U.S. 87 (1913)."
592,2," Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. § 365, allows a trustee to assume or reject a debtor's executory contracts and 
unexpired leases subject to the subsequent approval of the bankruptcy court.  Collective-bargaining agreements can be rejected 
only if the additional requirements of 11 U. S. C. § 1113 are met."
592,3," As Judge D. H. Ginsburg, writing for the Court of Appeals, noted: ""We cannot sustain the ICC's position that this provision empowers it to override a [collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)].  
First, and most important, the ICC's position finds no support in the language of the statute.  By its terms, § 11341(a) "
593,," contemplates exemption only from 'the antitrust laws and from all other law' to the extent necessary to carry out the transaction.  
Nowhere does it say that the ICC may also override contracts, nor has it ever, in any of the various iterations since its initial 
enactment in 1920, included even a general reference to 'contracts,' much less any specific reference to CBAs.  Nor has the ICC 
explained how we can read the term 'other law,' as it has done, to mean 'all legal obstacles.' Dispatchers, J. A. 207.  None of the 
Supreme Court decisions, discussed below, authorizing the ICC to abrogate an 'other law' even suggests that the term means 
'all legal obstacles.' The ICC itself, prior to its 1983 decision in DRGW, recognized as much.  See Gulf, Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co. -
- Abandonment, 282 I. C. C. 311, 335 (1952) ('None of the decisions in the [Supreme Court] cases . . . relates to private

593,4," All but two of the cases that the Court cited in the Philadelphia decision to support the rule against implicit repeals of the 
antitrust statutes arose under a regulatory framework in which there was no mention of exemption. United States v. Philadelphia 
Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 350, n. 28 (1963). See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S., at 314-315; United 
States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U.S. 505 (1898); Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S., at 343, 374-376 (plurality 
and dissenting opinions); United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U.S., at 105, 107; Keogh v. Chicago & 
Northwestern R. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 161-162 (1922); Central Transfer Co. v. Terminal Railway Assn. of St. Louis, 288 U.S. 469, 
474-475 (1933); Terminal Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 297 U.S. 500, 513-515 (1936); United States v. Borden Co., 
308 U.S. 188, 197-206 (1939); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 226-228 (1940); Georgia v. 
Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 456-457 (1945); United States Alkali Export Assn., Inc. v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 205-
206 (1945); Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U.S. 797, 809-810 (1945); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 9 (1958); United States v. Radio Corp. of America, 358 U.S. 334 (1959); California v. FPC, 369 U.S. 482 (1962); Silver v. 
New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341 (1963). The other two cases involve regulations with explicit exemptions from the 
antitrust laws, but do not support the position taken by the Court in this case.  In Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn., Inc. 
v. United States, 362 U.S. 458 (1960), this Court held that § 6 of the Clayton Act's exemption of agricultural cooperatives from 
the antitrust law only protected the formation of those associations; once formed they could not engage in any further conduct 
that would violate the antitrust laws. In Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296 (1963), the Court held 
that the exemption relieving airlines from the operation of the antitrust laws when certain transactions were approved by the Civil 
Aeronautics Board did not exempt the airlines from all antitrust violations, but only exempted them from violations stemming from 
activity explicitly governed by the regulatory scheme."
593,5," Again Judge Ginsburg's observation is pertinent: ""Moreover, the ICC's proposed insertion of 'all legal obstacles' into the statutory language would lead to most bizarre results.  
Under the ICC's reading, it could set to naught, in order to facilitate a merger, a carrier's solemn undertaking, in a bond indenture 
or a bank loan, to refrain from entering into any such transaction without the consent of its creditors.  Cf.  Gulf, Mobile & Ohio, 
282 I. C. C. at 331-35 (declaring itself without power, in an abandonment context, to relieve a carrier from its 'contractual 
obligations for the payment of rent').  We do not think it likely that Congress would grant the ICC a power with so much potential 
to destabilize the railroad industry; we are confident, however, that it would not do so without so much as a word to that effect in 
the statute itself.  Never, either in its decisions here under review or in prior cases, has the ICC offered any justification for this 
most unlikely reading of the Act."" 279 U.S. App. D. C., at 244-245, 880 F. 2d, at 567-568. "
594,6," ""No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts. . . ."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 1."
594,7," After reviewing the legislative history, Judge Ginsburg concluded: ""From our review of this history, we are confident that Congress did not intend, when it enacted the immunity provision, to 
override contracts.  First, Congress focused nearly exclusively, in the hearings and debates on the 1920 Act, on specific types of 
laws it intended to eliminate -- all of which were positive enactments, not common law rules of liability, as on a contract.  Cf.  
Association of Flight Attendants v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 879 F. 2d 906, 917 (D. C. Cir. 1989). Indeed, Commissioner Clark, who 
presented the immunity idea to the House and Senate Commerce Committees in the hearings cited above, did not once 
suggest, over the course of several days and several hundred pages, that the proposed immunity might relieve a carrier of its 
obligations under negotiated agreements with third parties."" 279 U.S. App. D. C., at 247, 880 F. 2d, at 570. "
595,8," In the ICC order approving the merger of Chessie System, Inc., and Seaboard Coastline Industries, Inc., the ICC discussed 
how the coordination of facilities would generate significant cost reductions and improved economic efficiency.  CSX Corp. -- 
Control -- Chessie System, Inc., and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., 363 I. C. C. 521, 556 (1980). The ICC noted: ""These savings will spring from common-point coordination projects, mechanical and engineering department coordinations, 
locomotive and car utilization improvements, and internal rerouting efficiencies.  Each of these projects is discussed separately 
below."" Ibid. In the discussion that followed, the ICC did discuss plans to expand the car production facilities at Raceland, Kentucky, in order 
to make cars for a member line that had been buying its cars from an independent manufacturer.  The ICC found that the 
applicants had failed to show that the public would derive any benefit from this plan.  There was no discussion of the 
consolidation of that facility by closing Seaboard's car repair shop in Waycross, Georgia.  Nor did the ICC discuss the 
consolidation of locomotive works in Norfolk Southern Corp. -- Control -- Norfolk & W. R. Co. and Southern R. Co., 366 I. C. C. 
173 (1982). "
611,1," Defendants California Society of Anesthesiologists, California League of Anesthesiologists, and Yong Suk have been 
dismissed from the case. The remaining defendants are: NME Hospitals, Inc., owner and operator of Manteca Hospital; National 
Medical Enterprises, Inc., the parent company of NME; and John Menaugh, the hospital administrator. "
612,2," See Bhan, 669 F. Supp. at 1007. Bhan appears to have earned eighty percent of his income as an anesthetist from Manteca 
Hospital and twenty percent from these other sources. See Appellant's Opening Brief at 11. "
614,3," The classic formulation appears in the Chicago Board of Trade opinion: HN7[
] ""The true test of legality is whether the 
restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress 
or even destroy competition."" Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 
(1918) (Brandeis, J.)"
614,4," Areeda describes the test in the following manner: HN10[
] First, what harm to competition results or may result from the collaborators' activities? Second, what is the object 
they are trying to achieve, and is it a legitimate and significant one; that is, what are the nature and magnitude of the 
""redeeming virtues"" of the challenged collaboration? Third, is the restraint reasonably necessary for the achievement of any 
such legitimate objectives? That is, are there other and better ways - so-called less restrictive alternatives - by which the 
collaborators can achieve their legitimate objectives with fewer harms to competition?"
614,7," P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1502, at 371 (1986). "
615,5," For a detailed analysis of Manteca's share of the market in which area hospitals competed for patients, see Bhan, 669 F. Supp. 
at 1018-20. "
616,6," The hospital will still consider the individual merits of each physician applicant in granting staff privileges. It has simply decided 
that only physician providers may apply."
616,7," Only one case in this circuit concerns a situation similar to Bhan's. See Hahn v. Oregon Physicians' Serv., 868 F.2d 1022 (9th 
Cir. 1988) (summary judgment denied in case in which podiatrists sued a health plan for discrimination against their class of 
providers in favor of orthopedists). Although the opinion is unclear, the Hahn court appears to have applied the rule of reason. 
The court there explicitly followed the logic of Barry, a case in which this circuit applied rule of reason analysis to a group boycott 
case. See id. at 1031 (discussing Barry v. Blue Cross, 805 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1986). In addition, Hahn differs from the case at hand in that 1) Hahn involved a health plan rather than a hospital, perhaps not a 
material difference, however, and 2) the Hahn defendant went out of its way to state that quality of care could not possibly be an 
issue in the case, clearly a material difference."
616,8," We are not suggesting the defendants' justification that the doctors are better than the nurses is always true. We are merely 
saying that HN15[
] before deciding to create a new per se category, we must ask whether there are cases within that category 
in which a comparison of the harms and benefits to competition would find a balance in favor of benefits. If we see the possibility 
of a significant body of such cases, the category is inappropriate for per se treatment. See P. Areeda, supra, para. 1510c, at 
421-24 (explaining why a court must consider potential justifications in defining a new per se category); see also Northwest 
Stationers, 472 U.S. at 289 (""per se approach permits categorical judgments with respect to certain business practices that have 
proved to be predominantly anti-competitive""). Under a rule of reason inquiry, the plaintiff can always present evidence that the 
defendants' assertions of competitive benefits are untrue and disingenuous. "
617,9," To survive a summary judgment motion by a defendant on this point, a plaintiff must demonstrate that there are disputed 
material facts on this question. P. Areeda, supra, para. 1502, at 371-72."
617,10," In other words, HN19[
] one aspect of the market power inquiry is to ask whether the defendant has the power to do what it 
allegedly wanted to do -- that is, whether the defendant can actually influence the market. In Indiana Dentists, the plaintiffs did 
not need to present an elaborate market analysis to show that the federation dentists had enough power to produce an effect in 
the market. The dentists had already done it. The plaintiff there showed that the dentists were actually able to produce the effect 
they wanted by completely preventing insurers from obtaining x-rays in at least two localities in a case in which the markets were 
essentially local. Thus, the dentists must have had market power in at least two relevant markets, and their actions clearly met 
the test of ""likely to affect competition."""
617,11," Some of the Hahn language could be read to suggest a different allocation of the burdens in a rule of reason case. See Hahn, 
868 F.2d at 1026, 1031 (discussing burdens under Barnes v. Arden Mayfair, Inc., 759 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1985)). That language, 
however, refers to the allocation of burdens for determining whether a conspiracy exists. See Hahn 868 F.2d at 1026 (citing the 
following line of conspiracy cases: Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 574; Barnes, 759 F.2d at 680; ALW, Inc. v. United Air Lines, Inc., 510 
F.2d 52, 55 (9th Cir. 1975)). While the existence of a conspiracy was at issue in the Hahn appeal, it is not at issue in this appeal."
617,12," Even this condition is suspect as evidence of the geographic market given that 1) when Bhan worked at Manteca Hospital, he 
also worked at hospitals in other towns; and 2) doctors at Manteca hospital used doctors based in other towns to cover for them. "
618,13," HN21[
] The Supreme Court also has suggested that elaborate market analysis may not be necessary in a rule of reason 
case where there is a ""naked"" agreement not to compete in terms of price or output. In such a case, the defendant must present 
some justification based on pro-competitive effects even if the plaintiff has failed to provide adequate market analysis. National 
Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 109-10, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984) (concerning 
restrictions on the output and price of televised college football games); see Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 
U.S. 717, 729-30, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988) (describing naked restraints); Indiana Dentists, 476 U.S. at 460 
(same). No such agreement exists in this case. "
631,1," See attachments to supplemental affidavit of Anthony M. Radice, including: Exhibit 1 at 45-48 (Christianson's brief before the 
Seventh Circuit); Exhibit 2 at 9-10 (Christianson's supplemental brief before the Seventh Circuit); and Exhibit 3 (transcript of the 
argument before the Seventh Circuit at 44). "

653,1," Section 1 provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U. S. C. § 1. "
654,," Section 2 provides in pertinent part: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U. S. C. § 2."
654,2," The monetary damages in this case were assessed entirely against COA, the District Court having ruled that the city was 
immunized by the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2750, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 34-36, which exempts 
local governments from paying damages for violations of the federal antitrust laws. Although enacted in 1984, after the events at 
issue in this case, the Act specifically provides that it may be applied retroactively if ""the defendant establishes and the court 
determines, in light of all the circumstances . . . that it would be inequitable not to apply this subsection to a pending case."" 15 U. 
S. C. § 35(b).  The District Court determined that it would be, and the Court of Appeals refused to disturb that judgment.  
Respondent has not challenged that determination in this Court, and we express no view on the matter."
654,3," S. C. Code Ann. § 5-23-10 (1976) (""Building and zoning regulations authorized"") provides that ""for the purpose of promoting 
health, safety, morals or the general welfare of the community, the legislative body of cities and incorporated towns may by 
ordinance regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures."" Section 5-23-20 (""Division of municipality into districts"") provides that ""for any or all of such purposes the local legislative body 
may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the 
purposes of this article.  Within such districts it may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, 
repair or use of buildings, structures or land."" "
655,," Section 6-7-710 (""Grant of power for zoning"") provides that ""for the purposes of guiding development in accordance with existing 
and future needs and in order to protect, promote and improve the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, 
appearance, prosperity, and general welfare, the governing authorities of municipalities and counties may, in accordance with 
the conditions and procedures specified in this chapter, regulate the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of 
buildings and other structures. . . .  The regulations shall . . . be designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety 
from fire, panic, and other dangers, to promote the public health and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air; to 
prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to protect scenic areas; to facilitate the adequate 
provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, and other public requirements."""
655,4," The dissent contends that, in order successfully to delegate its Parker immunity to a municipality, a State must expressly 
authorize the municipality to engage (1) in specifically ""economic regulation,"" post, at 388, (2) of a specific industry, post, at 391.  
These dual specificities are without support in our precedents, for the good reason that they defy rational implementation. "
656,," If, by authority to engage in specifically ""economic"" regulation, the dissent means authority specifically to regulate competition, 
we squarely rejected that in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34 (1985), as discussed in text.  Seemingly, however, the dissent 
means only that the State authorization must specify that sort of regulation whereunder ""decisions about prices and output are 
made not by individual firms, but rather by a public body."" Post, at 387.  But why is not the restriction of billboards in a city a 
restriction on the ""output"" of the local billboard industry?  It assuredly is -- and that is indeed the very gravamen of Omni's 
complaint.  It seems to us that the dissent's concession that ""it is often difficult to differentiate economic regulation from 
municipal regulation of health, safety, and welfare,"" post, at 393, is a gross understatement.  Loose talk about a ""regulated 
industry"" may suffice for what the dissent calls ""antitrust parlance,"" post, at 387, but it is not a definition upon which the criminal 
liability of public officials ought to depend. LEdHN[6B][
] [6B] Under the dissent's second requirement for a valid delegation of Parker immunity -- that the authorization to regulate pertain to a 
specific industry -- the problem with the South Carolina statute is that it used the generic term ""structures,"" instead of conferring 
its regulatory authority industry-by-industry (presumably ""billboards,"" ""movie houses,"" ""mobile homes,"" ""TV antennas,"" and every 
other conceivable object of zoning regulation that can be the subject of a relevant ""market"" for purposes of antitrust analysis).  
To describe this is to refute it.  Our precedents not only fail to suggest, but positively reject, such an approach.  ""The municipality 
need not 'be able to point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization' in order to assert a successful Parker defense to an 
antitrust suit."" Hallie, 471 U.S., at 39 (quoting Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 415 (1978))."
656,5," The dissent is confident that a jury composed of citizens of the vicinage will be able to tell the difference between ""independent 
municipal action and action taken for the sole purpose of carrying out an anticompetitive agreement for the private party."" Post, 
at 395-396.  No doubt.  But those are merely the polar extremes, which like the geographic poles will rarely be seen by jurors of "
657,," the vicinage.  Ordinarily the allegation will merely be (and the dissent says this is enough) that the municipal action was not 
prompted ""exclusively by a concern for the general public interest,"" post, at 387 (emphasis added).  Thus, the real question is 
whether a jury can tell the difference -- whether Solomon can tell the difference -- between municipal-action-not-entirely-
independent-because-based-partly-on-agreement-with-private-parties 
that 
is 
lawful 
and 
municipal-action-not-entirely-
independent-because-based-partly-on-agreement-with-private-parties that is unlawful.  The dissent does not tell us how to put 
this question coherently, much less how to answer it intelligently.  ""Independent municipal action"" is unobjectionable, ""action 
taken for the sole purpose of carrying out an anticompetitive agreement for the private party"" is unlawful, and everything else 
(that is, the known world between the two poles) is un-addressed. The dissent contends, moreover, that ""the instructions in this case, fairly read, told the jury that the plaintiff should not prevail 
unless the ordinance was enacted for the sole purpose of interfering with access to the market."" Post, at 396, n. 9 (emphasis 
added).  That is not so.  The sum and substance of the jury's instructions here was that anticompetitive municipal action is not 
lawful when taken as part of a conspiracy, and that a conspiracy is ""an agreement between two or more persons to violate the 
law, or to accomplish an otherwise lawful result in an unlawful manner."" App. 79.  Although the District Court explained that ""it is 
perfectly lawful for any and all persons to petition their government,"" the court immediately added, ""but they may not do so as a 
part or as the object of a conspiracy."" Ibid. These instructions, then, are entirely circular: An anticompetitive agreement becomes 
unlawful if it is part of a conspiracy, and a conspiracy is an agreement to do something unlawful.  The District Court's 
observation, upon which the dissent places so much weight, that ""if by the evidence you find that [COA] procured and brought 
about the passage of ordinances solely for the purpose of hindering, delaying or otherwise interfering with the access of [Omni] 
to the marketing area involved in this case . . . and thereby conspired, then, of course, their conduct would not be excused under 
the antitrust laws,"" id., at 81, see post, at 387, n. 2, is in no way tantamount to an instruction that this was the only theory upon 
which the jury could find an immunity-destroying ""conspiracy."""
657,6," LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] "
658,," We have proceeded otherwise only in the ""very limited and well-defined class of cases where the very nature of the 
constitutional question requires [this] inquiry."" United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383, n. 30 (1968) (bill of attainder).  See 
also Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 268, n. 18 (1977) (race-based motivation). "
661,1," Construing the statute in the light of the common law concerning contracts in restraint of trade, we have concluded that only 
unreasonable restraints are prohibited. ""One problem presented by the language of § 1 of the Sherman Act is that it cannot mean what it says.  The statute says that 
'every' contract that restrains trade is unlawful.  But, as Mr. Justice Brandeis perceptively noted, restraint is the very essence of 
every contract; read literally, § 1 would outlaw the entire body of private contract law.  Yet it is that body of law that establishes 
the enforceability of commercial agreements and enables competitive markets -- indeed, a competitive economy -- to function 
effectively. ""Congress, however, did not intend the text of the Sherman Act to delineate the full meaning of the statute or its application in 
concrete situations.  The legislative history makes it perfectly clear that it expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad 
mandate by drawing on common-law tradition.  The Rule of Reason, with its origins in common-law precedents long antedating 
the Sherman Act, has served that purpose. . . .  [The Rule of Reason] focuses directly on the challenged restraint's impact on 
competitive conditions."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-688 (1978) (footnotes 
omitted). We have also confined the Sherman Act's mandate by holding that the independent actions of the sovereign States and their 
officials are not covered by the language of the Act.  Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). "
662,2," The jury returned its verdict pursuant to the following instructions given by the District Court: ""So if by the evidence you find that that person involved in this case procured and brought about the passage of ordinances 
solely for the purpose of hindering, delaying or otherwise interfering with the access of the Plaintiff to the marketing area 
involved in this case . . . and thereby conspired, then, of course, their conduct would not be excused under the antitrust laws. ""So once again an entity may engage in . . . legitimate lobbying . . . to procure legislation even if the motive behind the lobbying 
is anticompetitive. ""If you find Defendants conspired together with the intent to foreclose the Plaintiff from meaningful access to a legitimate 
decision making process with regard to the ordinances in question, then your verdict would be for the Plaintiff on that issue."" 
App. 81."
662,3," ""The Sherman Act reflects a legislative judgment that ultimately competition will produce not only lower prices, but also better 
goods and services.  'The heart of our national economic policy long has been faith in the value of competition.' Standard Oil Co. 
v. FTC, 340 U.S. 231, 248 [(1951)].  The assumption that competition is the best method of allocating resources in a free market 
recognizes that all elements of a bargain -- quality, service, safety, and durability -- and not just the immediate cost, are 
favorably affected by the free opportunity to select among alternative offers.  Even assuming occasional exceptions to the 
presumed consequences of competition, the statutory policy precludes inquiry into the question whether competition is good or 
bad."" National Society of Professional Engineers, 435 U.S., at 695. "
663,4," In Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622 (1980), this Court recognized that ""notwithstanding [42 U. S. C.] § 1983's 
expansive language and the absence of any express incorporation of common-law immunities, we have, on several occasions, 
found that a tradition of immunity was so firmly rooted in the common law and was supported by such strong policy reasons that 
'Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.' Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555 (1967)."" 
Id., at 637. Nevertheless, the Court refused to find a firmly established immunity enjoyed by municipal corporations at common 
law for the torts of their agents.  ""Where the immunity claimed by the defendant was well established at common law at the time 
[42 U. S. C.] § 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have 
construed the statute to incorporate that immunity. But there is no tradition of immunity for municipal corporations, and neither 
history nor policy supports a construction of § 1983 that would justify"" according them such immunity. Id., at 638. See also Will v. 
Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 70 (1989) (""States are protected by the Eleventh Amendment while municipalities 
are not . . .""). "
664,5," Contrary to the Court's reading of Hallie, our opinion in that case emphasized the industry-specific character of the Wisconsin 
legislation in explaining why the delegation satisfied the 'clear articulation' requirement.  At issue in Hallie was the town's 
independent decision to refuse to provide sewage treatment services to nearby towns -- a decision that had been expressly 
authorized by the Wisconsin legislation.  471 U.S., at 41. We wrote: ""Applying the analysis of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389 (1978), it is sufficient that the statutes 
authorized the City to provide sewage services and also to determine the areas to be served."" Id., at 42. ""Nor do we agree with the Towns' contention that the statutes at issue here are neutral on state policy. The Towns attempt to 
liken the Wisconsin statutes to the Home Rule Amendment involved in Boulder, arguing that the Wisconsin statutes are neutral 
because they leave the City free to pursue either anticompetitive conduct or free-market competition in the field of sewage 
services.  The analogy to the Home Rule Amendment involved in Boulder is inapposite.  That Amendment to the Colorado 
Constitution allocated only the most general authority to municipalities to govern local affairs.  We held that it was neutral and did 
not satisfy the 'clear articulation' component of the state action test.  The Amendment simply did not address the regulation of 
cable television.  Under home rule the municipality was to be free to decide every aspect of policy relating to cable television, as 
well as policy relating to any other field of regulation of local concern.  Here, in contrast, the State has specifically authorized 
Wisconsin cities to provide sewage services and has delegated to the cities the express authority to take action that foreseeably 
will result in anticompetitive effects.  No reasonable argument can be made that these statutes are neutral in the same way that 
Colorado's Home Rule Amendment was."" Id., at 43. We rejected the argument that the delegation was insufficient because it did not expressly mention the foreseeable 
anticompetitive consequences of the city of Eau Claire's conduct, but we surely did not hold that the mere fact that incidental 
anticompetitive consequences are foreseeable is sufficient to immunize otherwise unauthorized restrictive agreements between 
cities and private parties."

371, n. 3 (citation omitted), may of course have an indirect effect on the total output in the billboard industry, see ante, at 373-
374, n. 4, as well as on a number of other industries, but the Court surely misreads our cases when it implies that a general 
grant of zoning power represents a clearly articulated decision to authorize municipalities to enter into agreements to displace 
competition in every industry that is affected by zoning regulation. "
665,7," A number of Courts of Appeals have held that a municipality which exercises its zoning power to further a private agreement to 
restrain trade is not entitled to state-action immunity. See, e. g., Westborough Mall, Inc. v. Cape Girardeau, 693 F. 2d 733, 746 
(CA8 1982) (""Even if zoning in general can be characterized as 'state action,' . . . a conspiracy to thwart normal zoning 
procedures and to directly injure the plaintiffs by illegally depriving them of their property is not in furtherance of any clearly 
articulated state policy""); Whitworth v. Perkins, 559 F. 2d 378, 379 (CA5 1977) (""The mere presence of the zoning ordinance 
does not necessarily insulate the defendants from antitrust liability where, as here, the plaintiff asserts that the enactment of the 
ordinance was itself a part of the alleged conspiracy to restrain trade"")."
665,8," No such agreement was involved in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34 (1985). In that case the plaintiffs challenged independent 
action -- the determination of the service area of the city's sewage system -- that had been expressly authorized by Wisconsin 
legislation.  The absence of any such agreement provided the basis for our decision in Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 266-
267 (1986) (""The distinction between unilateral and concerted action is critical here. . . .  Thus, if the Berkeley Ordinance 
stabilizes rents without this element of concerted action, the program it establishes cannot run afoul of § 1""). "
666,9," The instructions in this case, fairly read, told the jury that the plaintiff should not prevail unless the ordinance was enacted for 
the sole purpose of interfering with access to the market.  See n. 2, supra.  Thus, this case is an example of one of the ""polar 
extremes,"" see ante, at 375, n. 5, that juries -- as well as Solomon -- can readily identify.  The mixed motive cases that concern 
the Court should present no problem if juries are given instructions comparable to those given below.  When the Court describes 
my position as assuming that municipal action that was not prompted ""exclusively by a concern for the general public interest"" is 
enough to create antitrust liability, ibid., it simply ignores the requirement that the plaintiff must prove that the municipal action is 
the product of an anticompetitive agreement with private parties. Contrary to our square holding in Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S. 
260 (1986), today the Court seems to assume that municipal action which is not entirely immune from antitrust scrutiny will 
automatically violate the antitrust laws."
666,10," ""There are many obstacles to discovering conspiracies, but the most frequent difficulties are three.  First, price-fixers and 
similar miscreants seldom admit their conspiracy or agree in the open.  Often, we can infer the agreement only from their 
behavior.  Second, behavior can sometimes be coordinated without any communication or other observable and reprehensible 
behavior.  Third, the causal connection between an observable, controllable act -- such as a solicitation or meeting -- and 
subsequent parallel action may be obscure."" 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1400, at 3-4 (1986). See also Turner, The Definition of Agreement under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. 
Rev. 655 (1962)(discussing difficulties of condemning parallel anticompetitive action absent explicit agreement among the 
parties)."
666,11, As the Court previously has noted: 
667,," ""In 1972, there were 62,437 different units of local government in this country.  Of this number 23,885 were special districts 
which had a defined goal or goals for the provision of one or several services, while the remaining 38,552 represented the 
number of counties, municipalities, and townships, most of which have broad authority for general governance subject to 
limitations in one way or another imposed by the State.  These units may, and do, participate in and affect the economic life of 
this Nation in a great number and variety of ways.  When these bodies act as owners and providers of services, they are fully 
capable of aggrandizing other economic units with which they interrelate, with the potential of serious distortion of the rational 
and efficient allocation of resources, and the efficiency of free markets which the regime of competition embodied in the antitrust 
laws is thought to engender."" Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 407-408 (1978) (footnotes omitted). "
684,1, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1988). 
685,2," The Court voiced this suggestion on two occasions in its opinion: ""This [antitrust] immunity does not necessarily obtain where 
the State acts not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market."" ""We reiterate that, with the 
possible market participant exception, any action that qualifies as state action is 'ipso facto'. . . 'exempt from the operation of the 
antitrust laws.'"" (Citation omitted)."
685,3, The relevant statutes provide:
685,14," -199-601. Authority of municipalities generally -- Nonliable. (a) Any first-class city, second-class city, and incorporated town may own, construct, acquire, purchase, maintain, and 
operate a television signal distribution system for the purpose of receiving, transmitting, and distributing television impulses 
and television energy, including audio signals and transient visual images, to the inhabitants of the city or town and to the 
inhabitants of an area not to exceed two (2) miles outside the boundaries of the city or town. (b) In no case shall a city or town be held liable for damages for failure to furnish or provide the service. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 14-199-601 (Supp. 1989)."
685,14," -199-602.  Appliances, fixtures, and equipment authorized. The city or town may erect, construct, operate, repair, and maintain in, upon, along, over, across, through, and under its 
streets, alleys, highways, and public grounds, poles, cross-arms, cables, wires, guywires, stubs, anchors, towers, antennas, 
pipes, connections, and other appliances, fixtures, and equipment necessary, expedient, or useful in connection with a 
television signal distribution system. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 14-199-602 (Supp. 1989). See also, Ark. Stat. Ann. §§ 14-199-303 & 309 (1987), which authorize municipalities 
to issue capital improvement bonds. "
686,4," The Supreme Court's recent decision to grant municipalities immunity against being sued when they award local monopolies to 
private businesses also supports our holding. "
692,1, Some parts of the record refer to six listed items. The exact number is irrelevant to any pending motion.
692,2," Williams and Honeywell both took their dispute to the Air Force, which eventually decided that if Williams did not agree to 
Honeywell's conditions, it would be in breach of its contract with the Air Force. Before bringing this suit, Williams appealed this "
693,," decision to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA). The ASBCA appeals were settled on January 28, 1988. 
Under the terms of the settlement, the government paid Williams $ 365,211.75."

695,9," Honeywell responds, also at length, by arguing that the ATC ""Policy Letter No. 4"" represented such a ""policy."" Because I 
conclude that the existence of a ""policy"" is not a prerequisite, I need not decide this issue."
695,10," See, e.g., Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76, 82 (2d Cir. 1981) (unless a regulatory scheme is ""so 
pervasive that Congress must be assumed"" to have intended antitrust immunity, immunity exists only when ""an agency, acting 
pursuant to a specific Congressional directive, actively regulates the particular conduct challenged"") (emphasis added). "
699,11," Honeywell argues that a finding of antitrust immunity would compel summary judgment on the remaining state law claims as 
well. The cases it cites are inapposite, however. They either extend to state law claims (1) the Noerr-Pennington ""first 
amendment"" antitrust immunity (for petitioning the government for anticompetitive ends), or (2) the immunity of governmental 
employees. I have found no case addressing the question of whether the immunity of private parties acting at the direction of 
federal governmental agencies also extends to related state (non-antitrust) law claims."
699,12," It is clear from this list of allegations that Williams brings these tortious interference claims for more than just Honeywell's 
conditional refusal to subcontract for the listed Section 13A items. Therefore, Honeywell's very brief argument that a business "
700,," may refuse to contract with a party for any reason sufficient to itself cannot dispose of the tortious interference counts. See doc. 
184, at 55 n.88."

708,1," Although in plaintiffs' amended complaint they also allege violations of the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, those claims are not 
at issue on appeal. "

] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any "
710,," of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them . . . ."""
710,15, U.S.C. § 13(a).
710,5," On appeal, plaintiffs also argue that the examples listed in the statute were necessary to the jury instructions because without 
those examples ""the instruction did not differentiate between the products involved in the price discrimination or make it clear 
that the defense could only justify price reductions after the alleged change occurred."" Plaintiffs' Br. at 36. However, plaintiffs 
failed to object below to the jury instruction on these grounds and therefore we do not consider them. "
711,6," The district court held a jury instruction conference during which proposed instructions could be submitted by counsel and 
objections to jury instructions could be made. During that conference, plaintiffs made the following objections to the changing 
conditions defense instruction. ""THE COURT: All right. The next proposed instructions are the changing conditions defense, which I will number Plaintiffs' 
proposal as 15G. . . . . MR. GIFFIN [plaintiffs' counsel]: Yes, sir, Your Honor. This -- the changing conditions defense is -- even as outlined in the 
ABA proposed jury instructions, talks about eminent deterioration of the perishable goods. I mean, we don't have that in this 
case. Obsolescence, distress sales, sales in good faith upon discontinuance of business and the goods sold. None of those provisions is in Defendants' proposal. They took those out of the ABA proposal. I mean, we would be 
satisfied to use the ABA with those conditions in it. I don't think the -- well, that's another matter, but I don't think -- THE COURT: Your point is that the ABA shows really the inapplicability of this defense to this case? MR. GIFFIN: I believe I'm right on that, Your Honor. Let me -- changing conditions defense is page E35. Yes. I mean, it's -- 
it talks about imminent deterioration of perishable goods. All the points that we have in our -- in our proposed instructions 
are in the ABA proposed instruction. And although that's another issue, frankly, I mean, this -- this defense -- there's been 
no evidence on it. But if such an instruction is given, I think the jury should be clearly told about what the changing 
conditions are and that it relates to these perishable goods, things like that."" R. Vol. XIV at 2315-16. After the instructions were given to the jury, the district court allowed counsel to make any additional 
objections to the instructions. Plaintiffs' counsel made no further objection to the changing conditions jury instruction. Plaintiffs 
raised the issue of whether declining prices constitute a changing condition when they renewed their motion for a directed 
verdict after the jury had returned a verdict against plaintiffs. However, this was not a timely objection. Fed. R. Civ. P. 51."
711,7," ""[A] new trial should be ordered in the absence of an objection below if an error in the instructions resulted in a miscarriage of 
justice, and we review instructions to which proper objection was not made only if they are patently plainly erroneous and 
prejudicial."" Aspen Highlands, 738 F.2d at 1516 (quotations and footnotes omitted); see Zimmerman v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan 
Ass'n, 848 F.2d 1047, 1054 (10th Cir. 1988). Even assuming that declining prices cannot constitute a changing condition, we 
cannot conclude that the instruction was ""patently plainly erroneous and prejudicial,"" Aspen Highlands, 738 F.2d at 1516 
(quotation omitted), because we do not read the instruction as necessarily suggesting that declining prices alone constitute a 
changing condition. "
712,8," The legislative history indicates that the purpose of the provision was to facilitate the ""ready disposition of goods characterized 
by fluid market conditions,"" H.R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 12 (1936), reprinted in 4 Kintner, The Legislative 
History: Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes 3190 (1980) [hereinafter ""Leg. History""], and to ""take care of recognized 
changes in market conditions, as well as to take care of seasonal and perishable goods."" 80 Cong. Rec. 6426 (1936), reprinted 
in Leg. History, supra, at 3138 (statement by Senator Austin who proposed the Senate's amendment to § 2(a) which constitutes 
the changing conditions defense); see also F. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 328 (1962)."
712,9," A United States Attorney General Report explains that: Because we view the 'changing conditions' proviso as designed to promote competitors' freedom to react realistically to the 
spontaneous movements of a dynamic market, a broad interpretation of this provision would, in our opinion, comport best 
with the Congressional intent as well as broader antitrust objectives. We believe, therefore, that an independent significant 
meaning might be accorded to the statutory phrase 'changing conditions affecting the market' to which a competitor might 
respond by revising his price -- wholly apart from the 'marketability of the goods concerned,' the second statutory factor 
which the enumerated examples in the proviso illustrate. In any event, we view the significant common denominator in 
these far from homogeneous examples not as a deterioration of the seller's goods or business position, but as a 
spontaneous shift in market conditions beyond the seller's control. . . . Report of the Attorney General's National Commission to Study the Antitrust Laws 178-179 (1955) (emphasis in original). "
713,10," Thus, we need not consider whether defendant's retroactive offer of volume discounts to plaintiffs may have cured the original 
discrepancy between prices offered to SWBT and plaintiffs."
713,11," Plaintiffs also challenge the jury's verdict in favor of defendants on the issue of intentional interference with prospective 
economic relations. Plaintiffs argue that because the jury instruction on the changing conditions defense was in error, it tainted 
the jury's view of the intentional interference claim as well. They additionally argue that there was insufficient evidence to support 
the jury's verdict. This challenge fails in two respects. First, because we hold that the jury instruction on changing conditions was 
not in error, it cannot provide a basis for undermining the jury's verdict on the intentional interference claim. In addition, failure to 
move for a directed verdict precludes later appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence. See Koch v. City of Hutchinson, 
814 F.2d 1489, 1496 (10th Cir. 1987), reh'g in part, on other grounds, 847 F.2d 1436 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909, 109 
S. Ct. 262, 102 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1988). Since plaintiffs failed to demonstrate where in the record they moved for a directed verdict 
on the issue of intentional interference with prospective business relations, they cannot challenge on appeal the sufficiency of 
the evidence supporting the jury's verdict on the intentional interference claim. 10th Cir. R. 28.2(d). "
714,12," Plaintiffs preserved this issue for appeal because they adequately objected to this jury instruction at the district court level on 
these grounds. R. Vol. XIV at 2299-01. "
715,13," Plaintiffs' proposed instruction provides in relevant part:$ ""VOLUME DISCOUNTS -- AVAILABILITY Volume discounts can also constitute price discriminations under the Robinson-Patman Act even if the same range of 
discounts were offered to all purchasers from defendants. Thus, a single schedule containing a range of discounts based 
upon volume of purchases could constitute price discrimination under the act if the maximum discount level is not 
functionally available to all purchasers. To be functionally available to all purchasers means that the level of discounts offered by defendants were equally available 
to all purchasers. If only large purchasers from defendants could, as a practical matter, qualify for the highest level of 
discount, then defendants' discounts were not functionally available to plaintiffs and therefore the price discrimination 
element of section 2(a) has been satisfied."" R. Doc. 285. "
717,14," Defendants argue that plaintiffs have waived any challenge to $ 3,813.51 of the sanctions which go to the travel and 
transcription costs of the depositions. Defendants' Br. at 21. However, because we affirm the award of sanctions in its entirety, 
we do not address the waiver issue. "
727,1," The court notes that the claims raised by MTI against CIS in the state action were counterclaims, and that plaintiffs also may 
have been required to assert these claims under the Kansas pleading rules. HN8[
] Kansas statutory law for the pleading of 
compulsory counterclaims provides: A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any 
opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim . . . . K.S.A. § 60-213(a) (1983 & Supp. 1991) (emphasis added). See also Mohr v. State Bank of Stanley, 241 Kan. 42, 50-51, 734 
P.2d 1071 (1987). The Kansas rules further allow for the pleading of a counterclaim that ""either matured or was acquired"" after 
the pleading was served, § 60-213(e), or when the failure to plead the counterclaim was due to ""oversight, inadvertence, or 
excusable neglect, . . . ."" § 60-213(f). Although the present defendants were not parties in the state action, plaintiffs arguably had 
the obligation to join defendants as ""contingently necessary persons"" in whose absence complete relief could not be accorded 
among those already parties to the state action. See §§ 60-213(h), -219(a)(1). "
729,2," Paragraph 14 of the complaint identifies Tameran as ""the manufacturer of microfilm readers for defendant McGraw-Hill [who] 
supplies virtually all of the microfilm readers for the McGraw-Hill microfilm customers in the construction market controlled by 
them."" "
731,3," Plaintiffs' brief in response to the motions to dismiss makes the oblique suggestion that the competitors McGraw-Hill and CIS 
have engaged in a ""vertical conspiracy."" This undeveloped suggestion misconstrues the nature of vertical restrictions, which 
involve arrangements between suppliers and sellers. See Cayman Exploration Corp. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 873 F.2d 
1357, 1360 (10th Cir. 1989)."
731,4," Even assuming that the acquisition of CIS assets by McGraw-Hill had an anticompetitive effect within the meaning of § 7 of the 
Clayton Act, the ""failing company defense"" might be applicable to the facts of this case. See H. Hovencamp, Economics and 
Federal Antitrust Law § 11.8 (1985). "
732,5," Unlike defendants, the court does not read Comet to create any blanket prohibition against private antitrust suits by suppliers, 
as opposed competitors or buyers. Although the Tenth Circuit has held that indirect suppliers have no standing to challenge the 
anticompetitive agreements of their purchasers, Zinser v. Continental Grain Co., 660 F.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 
U.S. 941 (1982), it appears to have left open the question of whether direct suppliers such as MTI might have standing in the 
appropriate case. "
737,*," Honorable Robert R. Merhige, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting by designation."
737,1," The cases before us have been consolidated on appeal. The Taffet case arises from the Middle District of Alabama, and the 
Carr case arises from the Southern District of Georgia. "
738,2," In 1986, Georgia Power may have had on hand as much as $ 117,903,014.58 worth of spare parts which had already been 
expensed but had not been used."
738,3," See Arkansas Elec. Coop. Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 375, 377, 103 S. Ct. 1905, 1908, 76 L. Ed. 2d 1 
(1983) (""The regulation of utilities is one of the most important of the functions traditionally associated with the police power of 
the States.""). "
740,4," As a preliminary issue, plaintiffs argue that Burford cannot apply because the district courts are not here sitting in equity. 
Though abstention rulings premised upon principles of comity and federalism were originally developed in the context of actions 
seeking equitable relief, those principles have also been applied to actions seeking monetary damages. See, e.g., Fair 
Assessment In Real Estate Ass'n, Inc. v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100, 107-116, 102 S. Ct. 177, 181-86, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1981) 
(holding that comity barred taxpayers' action under § 1983 for damages against state tax officials). This argument, consequently, 
is meritless."
740,5," The defendants do not refute the plaintiffs' assertion that the PSCs cannot award damages. The PSCs function prospectively 
rather than retroactively. See Ala.Code § 37-1-97 (1975); Ga.Code Ann. § 46-2-25 (1982). In spite of this fact, the defendants 
argue that the district courts should not hear this matter because the plaintiffs have not complained to the PSCs and therefore 
have not exhausted their administrative remedies. At oral argument, the defendants asserted that even though the state PSCs 
could not award damages, if complained to they might be able to concoct some civil remedy to redress the plaintiffs' injuries. The 
defendants, however, have not articulated what this remedy might be. Under this Court's precedent, HN5[
] exhaustion is not 
required ""when the administrative remedy is inadequate . . . or would not provide relief commensurate with the claim."" Panola 
Land Buyers Ass'n v. Shuman, 762 F.2d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1985). Because the PSCs can provide no retroactive relief or 
damages commensurate with the plaintiffs' claims, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not necessary. "
741,6," The determination of damages in this case is a complex task. ""Although 'speculation and guesswork' should not be the basis 
for ascertaining damages, . . . damages need not be calculated by mathematical precision. . . . 'Any other rule would allow a 
wrongdoer to profit by his wrongdoing at the expense of his victim.'"" United States v. Killough, 848 F.2d 1523, 1531 (11th 
Cir.1988) (quoting Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 264-65, 66 S. Ct. 574, 579-80, 90 L. Ed. 652 (1946)) (citation 
omitted). Consequently, the assertion that the case should be barred because the district courts' calculations may not be 
mathematically precise has no merit. "
742,7," In Maislin Indus., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 110 S. Ct. 2759, 111 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1990), the Supreme Court 
reviewed the origins of the doctrine, explaining that the doctrine's rigid approach was necessary to eradicate the practices of 
shipping clerks in the early twentieth century who intentionally misquoted rates to favored customers as a means of offering 
special rebates or discounts.  Id. 110 S. Ct. at 2766. "
743,8," The only reported case which addresses the filed rate doctrine specifically in the RICO context is H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell 
Tel. Co., 734 F. Supp. 879 (D.Minn.1990). This case went to the Supreme Court on the issue of what constitutes a ""pattern"" of 
racketeering for RICO purposes. The Supreme Court did not reach the filed rate issue.  H.J., Inc., 109 S. Ct. at 2898 n. 1. On 
remand, the district court found the suit barred by the filed rate doctrine. The state PSC had prior to remand by the Supreme 
Court recalculated the rate in question for purposes of a pending state investigation. This recalculation eradicated the need for 
the federal court to become involved in the complex calculations required to arrive at a figure for damages. The district court, 
however, feared that even the availability of RICO treble damages might impermissibly influence the manner in which the state 
PSC set rates.  H.J., Inc., 734 F. Supp. at 886. Thus, relying on the district court opinion in LILCO (since disagreed with by the 
Second Circuit) and the district court opinion in Carr (here under review), the H.J. district court on remand dismissed the case. "

individualized to the plaintiff's situation, etc.]. (emphasis in the original) (usually followed by shame-on-you gestures and giggling). "
752,2," As will be explained more fully in the following pages, the court believes that summary judgment should be entered on all of the 
plaintiff's federal causes of action. As a result, the court believes that it would more than justified in leaving the state causes of 
action to be resolved in state court. Nevertheless, the court does have pendent jurisdiction to consider the state causes of action 
despite its disposal of the federal causes of action, and by exercising that pendent jurisdiction, the court believes that better use 
will be made of scarce judicial resources. For this reason, the court, in the following pages, will address not only the plaintiff's 
federal causes of action, but also the plaintiff's state causes of action in light of the defendants' motions."
752,3," The court has varied the order in which the plaintiff's various causes of action will be addressed in light of the defendants' 
motions from the order that they are presented in the complaint. This change was made only to facilitate the court's analysis and, 
since all of the plaintiff's various causes of action are considered, should not in any way disturb the result that the court believes 
is mandated by the relevant statutes and case law. "
753,4," Another grounds suggested by the defendants for granting their motions for summary judgment on the plaintiff's RICO cause of 
action is their alleged good faith in stating that the plaintiff was a ""convicted felon."" See United States v. Casperson, 773 F.2d 
216 (8th Cir. 1985); United States v. Hopkins, 744 F.2d 716 (10th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1004 (1985); United States 
v. Townley, 665 F.2d 579 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1010 (1982) (stating that, in order to commit mail or wire fraud, a 
person must intend to deceive others). The defendants assert that the record in this case reveals that they honestly believed that 
the defendant was a convicted felon and that, despite careful checking, they were unable to discover the existence of the 
plaintiff's plea agreement. As a result, the defendants assert that their good faith is a complete bar to the court's finding the 
presence of mail or wire fraud in the instant case. As indicated in the main text of this section, the court reaches its conclusion 
that summary judgment should be granted on the plaintiff's RICO claim for different reasons, but notes that the defendant's 
good-faith argument is also quite compelling. See Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F.2d 1179, 1188 (4th Cir. 1988) (holding that 
merely negligent acts will not give rise to civil RICO liability)."
753,5," The Fourth Circuit's discussion of the materiality of the misrepresentation in the Brandenburg opinion was focused at the issue 
of proximate cause. In other words, the Fourth Circuit held that, among other requirements, it is necessary for a 
misrepresentation to be material before it can be properly regarded as the proximate cause of injury compensable by the civil 
RICO Act. Despite the factual and legal differences between the Brandenburg case and the present case, the reasoning is, 
nonetheless, transferable. "
754,6," As stated earlier in this memorandum opinion, the plaintiff's objection to the label ""convicted felon"" seems to be grounded in the 
fact that, in the Texas criminal proceeding, he pled guilty to the aggravated-promotion-of-prostitution charge under a plea 
agreement whereby a final ""adjudication of his guilt would be deferred"" as long as he completed his probation period without 
further criminal incident. Therefore, in some hyper-technical sense, the statement that the plaintiff is a ""convicted felon,"" when he 
is only a ""confessed felon,"" may not fully incorporate all of the subtleties of the plea agreement into which he entered with the 
prosecution, but in any event, there is nothing substantially inaccurate about the statement and, as a matter of law, cannot 
subject the defendants to any type of liability for defamation. "
756,7," In his pleadings in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff cites as one instance of the conspiratorial 
conduct that the defendants have taken in an effort maliciously to injure the plaintiff's business, their alleged efforts to induce the 
relevant licensing agency within the Commonwealth of Virginia to revoke the plaintiff's real estate license and thereby terminate 
his career as a real estate broker. Even if these allegations are true, the court would like to remind the plaintiff that ""whistle-
blowing"" is generally something that the law likes to encourage, not punish. If the present case involved attorneys instead of 
real-estate brokers, even counsel for the plaintiff would probably agree that disclosing a rival attorney's criminal past to the 
Virginia State Bar would be not only legal and proper, but also a practitioner's ethical obligation. Unquestionably, the legal 
profession imposes and expects higher standards from its members than those to which real-estate brokers are supposed to be 
held, but at minimum, putting a state licensing agency on notice of a licensee's possible violation of licensing requirements is not 
improper even when dealing with real-estate brokers and is not conduct that will subject the informer to liability pursuant to the 
Virginia Conspiracy Act. "
765,1, The Scott Fetzer company was formerly known as the Scott & Fetzer Company. 
766,2," Marshall R. Herron is Director, Sales Administration for Kirby."
766,3," Beginning sometime around the middle of 1980, Scott Fetzer formed the Kirby Sales Company to conduct business in the State 
of Texas. Rather than selling Kirby products to distributors who then sold those products to dealers or customers, the Kirby 
Sales Company distributed products by consignment. Each Kirby distributor in Texas signed a Consignment Agreement with the 
Kirby Sales Company and the Kirby Sales Company would be the sole source of new Kirby products, accessories and parts for 
the distributor. (Herron at para. 12-13)."
766,4," Adrian E. Budlong, Jr. was a Kirby distributor, National Sales Manager, Vice President-Sales and, ultimately, President of 
Kirby. He was President of Kirby from 1972 to 1979. He is currently under contract with Kirby as a Divisional Supervisor. 
(Budlong at para. 1)."
766,5," Peter B. Menke has been under contract as a Divisional Supervisor and was employed as Assistant to the President of Kirby 
and as Vice President-Sales from 1975 to 1981. (Menke at para. 1). "
767,6," Plaintiffs alleged $ 38.00 would be returned, but Jerry Cranfill has since amended that allegation, and agrees $ 30.00 is the 
correct amount. (Affidavit of Jerry Cranfill (""Cranfill"") at para. 13). "
769,7," As discussed below, the lack of significant probative evidence required to avoid summary judgment is particularly telling in view 
of the independent grounds, admitted by Jerry Cranfill, to support termination of the parties' relationship. See Paul Kadair, Inc. v. 
Sony Corp. of America, 694 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir. 1983) (no facts to support conspiracy claims put forth after defendants showed 
independent business reasons for refusal to deal); see also Landmark Development Corp. v. Chambers Corp., 752 F.2d 369, 
371 (9th Cir. 1985) (defendant terminated distributor for fraudulent purchase practices; ""the undisputed proof of this legitimate 
business reason was sufficient to preclude an inference of a vertical price-maintenance conspiracy from the refusal to sell to 
Landmark alone, and to impose upon plaintiffs the burden of advancing additional specific evidence of such a conspiracy""); 
Program Engineering, Inc. v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 634 F.2d 1188, 1195 (9th Cir. 1980) (once defendant shows legitimate 
business reasons for its conduct, ""plaintiff must come forward with specific factual support for its allegations""). "
770,8," The statute reaches only conspiracies; unilateral action, regardless of its effect, does not violate Section 1. See Monsanto Co. 
v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). Consequently, to the extent plaintiffs' 
claims deal with Kirby's unilateral action (see Am. Compl. para. XII (unilateral refusal to deal); Am. Compl. XXVIII; Cranfill Depo. 
at 81 (ISA fee ""imposed"" on distributors)), such claims are dismissed as a matter of law."
770,9," Plaintiffs assert in a general way that Kirby engaged in a per se group boycott, apparently to fix resale prices. (Am. Compl. 
para. XVII) Group boycotts, however, are only per se illegal if they involve an agreement among two or more traders at the same 
level in the market place. Davis-Watkins Co. v. Service Merchandise, 686 F.2d 1190, 1198-99 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 466 
U.S. 931, 80 L. Ed. 2d 190, 104 S. Ct. 1718 (1984). Here, there is no specific allegation and no evidence to support such a 
horizontal claim. See note 14 infra."
770,10," In her deposition, plaintiff Jerry Cranfill was actually asked about Count II o the plaintiff's original complaint. That Count, 
however, is merely repeated in Count I of the plaintiff's second amended complaint. "
771,11," Cf. AAA Liquors, Inc. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 705 F.2d 1203, 1207 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 919, 77 L. 
Ed. 2d 290, 103 S. Ct. 1903 (1983) (no claim for vertical price fixing where dealers maintained control)."
771,12," Because there was no such agreement, plaintiffs cannot support a per se claim merely because of their alleged termination 
and any alleged retaliation thereafter. Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics, Inc., 485 U.S. 717, 735-36, 99 L. Ed. 2d 
808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988) (""a vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels""). "
772,13," Although plaintiffs have alleged that some of Kirby's conduct involved a ""horizontal conspiracy"" (Am. Compl. para. XXI), 
alleged conspiracies between a manufacturer and its distributors are only treated as a horizontal when the source of the alleged 
conspiracy is a combination of the distributors. Red Diamond Supply, Inc. v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., 637 F.2d 1001, 1004 (5th 
Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Red Diamond Supply, Inc. v. Acme Welding & Supply Inc., 454 U.S. 827, 70 L. Ed. 2d 102, 102 
S. Ct. 119 (1981) (quoting H&B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 1978)); Muenster 
Butane, Inc. v. Stewart Co., 651 F.2d 292, 297 (5th Cir. 1981). On the other hand, ""when the manufacturer is the source, the 
conspiracy is vertical."" Red Diamond Supply, supra, 637 F.2d at 1004 (citing United States v. Arnold Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 
365, 372, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 1862, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249 (1967)). Here, there is no evidence of any contact between distributors or dealers to support a conspiracy claim. According to Jerry 
Cranfill, it was Kirby that forced distributors not to deal with her. See generally Parsons v. Ford Motor Co., 669 F.2d 308 (5th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 832, 74 L. Ed. 2d 72, 103 S. Ct. 73 (1982) (Ford had policy prohibiting dealers from selling to non-
franchised dealers called bootleggers; plaintiff was terminated because he fraudulently asserted he was a fleet purchaser and 
not a bootlegger, and summary judgment dismissing his antitrust claim was upheld where Ford and its dealers took steps 
against him)."

782,1," While the Court will refer to racing events only, in some jurisdictions pari-mutuel wagering also includes other types of contests, 
including betting on jai alai events. "
783,2," Until 1990, wagering pools were only combined on a intrastate basis because it was commonly thought that federal law 
precluded the commingling of wagering pools across state lines. In the spring of 1990, however, the racing industry reached an 
understanding with the Department of Justice as to the legality of interstate commingling. Since then, interstate commingling of 
wagering pools has increased dramatically. Tr. at 245-47, 638-39. "
784,3," The ""handle"" of a racetrack or jai alai fronton is the total amount bet on a pari-mutuel event or events. At a racetrack, the 
""average daily handle"" is the mean amount bet daily during a racing season. D.I. 105, para. 10. "
785,4," Section 7 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the

the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly."

785,5," These companies consist of Trac-Tote, Ace Totalisator, Colorado Data Systems, Burt Blackhurst and Microtote of Ohio. "
786,6," HHI is a measure of market concentration calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in the market and then 
summing the squares. The HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market. The HHI approaches 
zero when the market consists of a large number of firms of relatively equal size and reaches a maximum when a market is a 
monopoly. The Department of Justice's Merger Guidelines characterize a market as unconcentrated if its HHI is between 1000 
and 1800. A market is highly concentrated if its HHI is above 1800. United States Department of Justice Merger Guidelines § 3.1 
(1984), reprinted in 4Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) P13,103 at 20,561."
786,7," The Court notes that the primary reason for the Government's reliance upon total market revenues rather than segmented 
market revenues is that both parties stipulated to it. While the Court will address United Tote's contentions, it does appear "
787,," somewhat disingenuous for United to stipulate to a set of facts, unilaterally change its position during trial and then in post-trial 
briefs argue that the previous stipulation is misleading."
787,8," The middle segment of the market was the only part of the totalisator market about which the two parties disagreed and then 
only to a small extent. United Tote's proposed market shares would be 17.4% for United, 43.4% for Autotote and 39.2% for 
AmTote. See D.I. 138 at 10, D.I. 135 at 30-31. "
789,9," There are forty different types of wagers, five different ways of calculating exacta and quintella payoffs, fourteen different ways 
of calculating double daily payoffs, sixteen different ways of calculating trifecta payoffs, five different ways of calculating simple 
win pools and eleven different ways to calculate the state's share of the pari-mutuel handle. Tr. at 708."
789,10," This testimony was buttressed by the sworn statements of James Baker, a former ATL employee. In his deposition, Mr. Baker 
testified that: Autotote developed their own system in the early '80s -- late '70s early '80s, which is known as the J-25 system. They had a 
lot of difficulties with that. And they came to Australia at the time and purchased [a cash/sell] system design from ATL. Of 
course they have taken [it] since and refined it quite a bit to suit American conditions. But that's the genesis of that system. PX 151c. "
791,11," At trial, Lloyd Shelhamer testified that his 1987 estimate referred only to the effort level required for a potential entrant with no 
racetrack or computer experience. Tr. at 560. John Shelhamer testified that he believed that a totalisator system equivalent to 
the original United System 1000 could be developed today in the same time frame and at the same cost as the original - 
approximately twelve to thirteen months and 1.5 million dollars. Tr. at 598. While John Shelhamer's estimate may indeed be 
possible, the record demonstrates that the United System 1000 was developed by a company with twenty years of racing 
experience for use primarily in the small track segment, the system lacked any multi-track capabilities and that to date, no other 
totalisator supplier has been able to develop a system as quickly or as cheaply as United Tote originally did. Tr. at 599, 709, 
712. "
792,12," Similarly, racetracks face certain ""switching costs"" whenever they decide to go with a new vendor of totalisator services. For 
example, when Rockingham Park switched vendors just prior to the start of the racing season, it was forced to accept a higher 
price, had to rewire the track and build a new computer room. Tr. at 66-71. In addition, all of the pari-mutuel clerks would have 
had to have been retrained on the new system. This retraining period likely resulted in a net cost to the track in terms of 
downtime and errors. PX 1 at 16; Tr. at 331. "
795,13," When a film is first released by a film distributor for public exhibition, it is in its first run. Once the initial demand for the film has 
somewhat subsided, the film is shipped to a second run theater in the same area which shows it for a lower ticket price. Syufy, 
903 F.2d at 665 n. 7. "
796,14," The Court notes that Mr. Walter's belief that he could deliver a fully operational system within seven months is somewhat at 
odds with his earlier estimate that it would take five to ten man-years and cost 1 to 2 million dollars to modify his system for use 
in the North American market. In addition, even if ITS was able to rush a system into the market, it would face potentially 
insurmountable reputational problems if that system were to experience operational difficulties."
796,15," In 1987, Lloyd Shelhamer declared that ""ITS withdrew from the North American market with a very bad reputation. Were ITS 
to decide to reenter, I believe it would take many years of successfully operating at very small tracks before its negative 
reputation could be overcome."" PX 1 at 17-18. At trial, Lloyd Shelhamer revised his earlier opinion on grounds that in the 
intervening three to four years ITS had licensed software from the Hong Kong Jockey Club for use with its equipment, ""matured"" 
as a company, had a good reputation where they were operating and while it was possible that they might go into small 
racetracks, it was most likely that they would go into statewide networks, which Mr. Shelhamer described as their ""forte."" TR. at 
558. The record demonstrates, however, that despite having a license to sell the Hong Kong software since 1985, the only 
installation where ITS equipment is being used in conjunction with the licensed software, other than the Hong Kong Jockey Club 
itself, is at the Macau Jockey Club in Taiwan. DX 23. "
797,16," United Tote also claims that the introduction of AmTote's new Spectrum system will also erode and ultimately jeopardize 
United's competitive position. In particular, United Tote asserts that Spectrum's enhanced networking capabilities will 
substantially increase dominance at the large tracks and also result in a flood of fully depreciated equipment into the small track 
market once the older systems at the large tracks are replaced. Tr. 623-24, 648-49, 1113. The Court finds this argument 
unpersuasive given its highly speculative nature as to whether Spectrum will be a success or failure and as to what quantities 
the system will be available. "
798,17," The Court also finds that United Tote's argument that, without the merger, it could not effectively compete in the ever 
increasingly complicated totalisator system market due to research and development requirements, is somewhat undercut by its 
own 1988 10K form, where it stated that: Since incurring the costs to develop the United Tote System 1000 in 1979 and 1980, the Company has not spent significant 
amounts on research and development. Expenditures for research and development are anticipated to increase in the 
future as the Company continues the development of self-service and portable terminals and begins to adapt the United 
Tote System 1000 for other uses. The Company believes that the funds necessary for such development will be generated 
from operations. PX 16 at 8-9. Even if United Tote was unable to fund increased research and development costs from operations, United has failed to 
demonstrate that it would be unable to easily acquire such funds from alternate sources, such as merging with companies 
outside the market that would not have the same anti-competitive effects as the United/Autotote merger. "
814,1," If one accepts the percentage calculation that includes Verd-a-Ray and Lustra then the distortion of the market by the exclusion 
of Duro Test is even more obvious. Verd-a-Ray and Lustra essentially performed the same function that Duro Test did -- namely 
selling the manufacturers product through in-house distributors. "
815,2," In Judge Kram's opinion of March 12, 1987, she ruled that the Areeda-Turner presumptions should not apply in this case 
because the defendant was both a competitor of Energex and supplied Energex with fluorescent bulbs. Plaintiffs, however, in 
their pretrial papers have failed to provide an alternative analysis. In light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Atlantic and previous 
development of the law of predatory pricing, some analysis of whether the price defendant is charging is profit making is 
essential. Even if a strict Areeda-Turner analysis is not applied, plaintiff has failed to substantiate its claim. "
816,3," The exact date of the signing of these contracts is uncertain, although they are dated October 16, 1979. "
818,4," Although, this court will not enforce Phillips' agreement to adhere to its published price list on the ground that it is illegal, the 
court finds it highly unlikely that such an agreement ever existed. Mr. Caravetta, himself, testified that he told Mr. Tumminello 
that ""I am not going to tie you to anything. I understand you may have to float your line of discounts up and down. All I want to 
make sure is that we have a clear understanding that we float up and down with the same 5 percent differential from your top 
discount that you give to the level 2 distributors."" (Tr. 1728-1729). Thus Mr. Caravetta's own testimony demonstrates that any 
agreement was principally concerned with the 5% differential. In fact it would be illogical to have an agreement that combined 
both a contract to adhere to published prices and an agreement that Energex's discount would fluctuate if prices changed. "
819,5," Furthermore in the Kelly case, the contract, itself, did not violate the Sherman Act. It was the reason that the contract was 
entered into in the first place that violated the Sherman Act. "

834,*," Even so, I might note, it is improper for the Court to dispense with the necessary allegations to that effect. See McLain v. Real

841,1," Named plaintiffs include Antony Brown, James Bishop, John Buddenberg, Gary Couch, Graig Davis, Matthew J. Jaworski, 
Ricky Andrews, and Wesley Pritchert. "
843,2," The status of plaintiffs in this case is not affected by a decision issued by a United States District Court in Minnesota which 
held that the NFLPA was no longer involved in a collective bargaining relationship with the NFL. Powell v. NFL, No. 4-87-917 (D. 
Minn. filed May 29, 1991). The negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA in the present case and the NFL's implementation of 
the developmental squad concept preceded the actions in Powell upon which the District Court in Minnesota based its present 
holding. The Minnesota District Court's holding suggested that the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining 
representative ended on December 5, 1989 -- after all communications between the NFL and NFLPA on the developmental 
squad issue had ended and after the NFL implemented the developmental squad concept. Both parties agreed that the issue of 
the NFLPA's renunciation of its bargaining rights is not material to this case because all conduct material to this case occurred 
prior to the NFLPA's renunciation. Plaintiffs' Statement Of Material Facts Not In Genuine Dispute at P 4; Defendants' Response 
to Plaintiffs' Statement Of Material Facts Not In Genuine Dispute at P 4. "
844,3," Under the NLRA, mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include ""wage, hours, and other terms and conditions of 
employment . . . ."" 29 U.S.C. § 158(d) (1973); NLRB v. Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U.S. 342 (1958)."
844,4," It is important to note that the American Federation case cited by the Supreme Court involved a labor dispute in which there 
was a collective bargaining agreement in effect and that the employer sought to change mandatory subjects already "
845,," encompassed in that existing agreement. The present case involves an expired collective bargaining agreement where the 
employer seeks the shelter of the nonstatutory exemption for new terms involving mandatory subjects that were never part of the 
expired agreement. "
846,5," Ethan Lock, who has written in depth on the issue before the court, has noted that: simultaneous expiration of the agreement and the labor exemption undoubtedly would have had an impact on the parties' 
relative leverage in collective bargaining. At a minimum, such a result would have forced the parties to engage in 
meaningful negotiations at an earlier time and, in the absence of agreement, precipitated a quicker resolution of the merits 
of the pending lawsuit[s]. Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 Duke L.J. 339, 400 [hereafter referred to as ""Lock, The 
Scope of the Labor Exemption""]."
846,6," As will be discussed more fully below, the Supreme Court has described impasse as a recurring feature of collective 
bargaining which is often broken when either party brings various economic forces to bear in order to break the impasse. As 
such, when presented with an impasse claim, the NLRB or the courts would not only have to determine whether impasse 
occurred, but whether, if so, court or NLRB intervention at this point is premature given the parties respective economic forces 
which can help the parties break the impasse and resolve their own differences. Lock has noted that ""Congress designed the 
procedural framework of the NLRA to ensure that employers and employee representatives will make an honest effort to resolve 
their differences at the bargaining table. Congress clearly intended the parties involved in a collective bargaining relationship to 
resolve their own disputes."" Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption 1989 Duke L.J. at 382 (citations omitted). One court has added a new level of uncertainty to application of the nonstatutory exemption beyond expiration by holding that an 
employer can impose a restraint after expiration only if the employer ""reasonably believes that the [restraint] or a close variant of 
it will be incorporated in the next collective bargaining agreement."" Bridgeman v. NBA, 675 F. Supp. 960, 967 (D.N.J. 1987). Not 
only does this disregard the fact that the union has not agreed to the restraint, it requires courts to make the determination of 
whether the employer believed the restraint would be incorporated in a subsequent agreement, and whether such belief was 
""reasonable."" Again, different courts, given the same facts, will reach different conclusions. "
848,7," This court believes that the decision to extend any labor exemption beyond expiration of collective bargaining agreements is 
an issue properly left to Congress to resolve. "
849,8," While such extension can be justified by virtue of the fact that the union assented to the restraint at one point (when it 
executed the collective bargaining agreement), this assent, one might argue, can justifiably be regarded as continuing so long as 
there is no post-expiration objection to the restraint. This court believes that a better rule of law requires the parties to expressly 
agree to extend the terms in the collective bargaining agreement after expiration in order for the nonstatutory labor exemption to 
continue to shield the restraints from antitrust liability. Such a rule would obviate the fiction of assumed continued assent until 
impasse and would remove the issue of the applicability of the nonstatutory labor exemption from the indefinite twilight zone it is 
now in. Courts should not hold unions and employers to indefinite fictional contracts by treating the parties as if a collective 
bargaining agreement exists when in fact none exists. Furthermore, there is little incentive for the parties to execute a new 
collective bargaining agreement when the parties know that courts will continue indefinitely to honor the terms of an expired 
collective bargaining agreement without the parties even having to expressly agree to extend application of the terms in that 
agreement. "
850,9," This court's finding that the nonstatutory labor exemption does not extend beyond impasse is consistent with Supreme Court 
precedent. The Supreme Court and this Circuit have acknowledged that employers do not violate the labor laws by unilaterally 
changing employment terms after impasse as long as these changes have been offered as good faith proposals in bargaining. 
Laborers Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co., 484 U.S. at 483-84 n.5; Charles D. Bonanno 
Linen Service v. NLRB, 454 U.S. at 415-16 n.9; Southwestern Steel & Supply, Inc. v. NLRB, 806 F.2d at 1113; NLRB v. 
Cauthorne, 691 F.2d at 1025 (same); but see Powell v. NFL, 888 F.2d at 568 (nonstatutory labor exemption extends beyond 
impasse).  However, those rulings do not stand for the proposition that such unilateral changes or restraints are exempt from the 
antitrust laws. "
851,10," The fact that the principal issue in this case involves salary provisions, a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, does not 
trigger protection of the nonstatutory labor exemption simply by virtue of the fact that the expired collective bargaining agreement 
had salary provisions. That common thread is not enough. As discussed above, the developmental squad salary provision "
852,," involved a wholly new concept involving the creation of a new category of football player which was never negotiated by the NFL 
and NFLPA and had never been included in the expired collective bargaining agreement. The NFL acknowledged as much when 
it proposed a modification of the expired 1982 Collective Bargaining Agreement, not to change the salary provision but to make it 
inapplicable to developmental squad players who would be covered by a ""special services contract"" of $ 1,000 per week. 
Plaintiffs' Exhibits at 9."
852,11," The Supreme Court also noted that allowing an adjudicator to ""compel agreement when the parties themselves are unable to 
agree would violate the fundamental premise on which the [NLRA] is based -- private bargaining under governmental 
supervision of procedure alone, without any official compulsion over the actual terms of the contract."" H.K. Porter Co. v. NLRB,

Mr. Burris's name for Mr. Hartigan's. See Fed. R. App. Pro. 43(c)(1). "
858,1," We have limited our exposition of the facts to those that are essential to an understanding of the issues raised on appeal. For 
the complete story, the reader is referred to the district court's comprehensive opinion at 730 F. Supp. 826. "
859,2," ""A take-or-pay clause allocates part of the volume risk to the purchaser -- the pipeline company -- by obligating the purchaser 
to pay for a specified quantity of gas whether or not the purchaser actually takes delivery of that gas."" Pierce, supra, at 355."
859,3," Panhandle's gas purchases during this period have thus far survived regulatory and judicial review. See Office of Consumers' 
Counsel v. FERC, 286 U.S. App. D.C. 234, 914 F.2d 290 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (upholding FERC determination that Panhandle's 
purchases from gas producers were not abusive; remanding for further fact-finding on issue of whether Panhandle's purchases 
from Trunkline were prudent)."
859,4, Section 1.9 of the General Terms and Conditions applicable to Panhandle's G-2 tariff reads:
859,1," .9 General Service Buyer. General Service Buyer is any buyer which does not purchase gas from any other natural-gas 
company, as defined in the Natural Gas Act [NGA], for distribution in areas served with Seller's gas; provided, however, a "
860,," Buyer under the General Service Rate Schedule which seeks from Seller an increase in contract demand and Seller is 
unable to supply the increase in contract demand, then such Buyer may purchase natural gas from other natural-gas 
companies but shall remain a General Service Buyer under this Tariff. See Appellant's Supplemental Appendix at 347 (emphasis added). The meaning of the phrase ""as defined in the Natural Gas Act"" is a bone of contention between the parties, one that could affect 
the outcome of the case. The state maintains that Panhandle's characterization of the G tariff as a ""sole supplier"" contract is 
erroneous, and asserts therefore that the existence of the G tariff was no justification for Panhandle's refusal to transport gas 
during the early 1980s. The state maintains that the G tariff did not restrict G tariff customers from purchasing ""new gas,"" that is, 
gas not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce as of November 8, 1978, see 15 U.S.C. § 3431(a)(1)(A) and (B), directly 
from producers because producers are not ""natural gas companies"" under the NGPA. The NGPA didn't change the definition of ""natural-gas company"" under the NGA, however; it merely rendered the sale of ""new 
gas"" an event over which the FERC is not entitled to exercise jurisdiction.  Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., 38 FERC para. 
63,009 at 65,052-53 (1987). Moreover, the state concedes that producers who sell natural gas for resale in interstate commerce 
were, before enactment of the NGPA in 1978, natural gas companies under the NGA (15 U.S.C. § 717 (a)). Appellant's Brief at 
34. That is the only definition relevant to the interpretation of the G tariff as that is the definition incorporated by the tariff. It is 
true that in 1951, when the G tariff was first approved, gas producers were not considered to be ""natural-gas companies."" But 
producers sold almost exclusively to pipelines, so the omission of producers in the 1951 tariff was hardly significant. Moreover, the industry understanding changed with the Supreme Court's decision in Phillips Petroleum v. State of Wisconsin, 
347 U.S. 672, 98 L. Ed. 1035, 74 S. Ct. 794 (1954), which held that producers were subject to regulation as natural-gas 
companies under the NGA.  Id. at 677. Customers who contracted to purchase gas under the G tariff after Phillips were on 
notice that the tariff precluded purchases from gas producers as well as from other pipelines. CILCO last renewed its G tariff with 
Panhandle in 1970, well after Phillips, and well before enactment of the NGPA. It is possible, we suppose, to read the reference to the NGA definition in the G tariff as an attempt to incorporate all future 
manifestations of the definition, but that is not the interpretation adopted by the parties to the contract. Panhandle's customers 
also read the G tariff to require them to buy all their gas from Panhandle; CILCO took that position when it challenged the 
provision in its FERC complaint, after the NGPA modified the NGA definition of ""natural-gas company."" See Panhandle Eastern 
Pipe Line Co. v. FERC (Panhandle I), 881 F.2d 1101, 1105, 279 U.S. App. D.C. 386 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (per curiam). The 
administrative law judge who first ruled in the case, the FERC, and the D.C. Circuit each treated § 1.9 as requiring G tariff 
customers to purchase all of their requirements from Panhandle. See Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 32 FERC para. 63,085 
at 65,321-26 (1985) (the CILCO Complaint case); Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 38 FERC para. 61,164 at 61,465 (1987) 
(Opinion 265); Panhandle I, 881 F.2d at 1107. Absent language affirmatively contemplating and adopting future changes in that 
definition, we agree that Panhandle's interpretation of § 1.9 as a sole supplier provision was reasonable. The state cites evidence suggesting that Panhandle did not really interpret § 1.9 to bar its customers from purchasing gas 
directly from producers, but the district court found that Panhandle maintained the position that the G tariff was a sole supplier 
tariff and that finding is not clearly erroneous. At any rate, whether Panhandle subjectively believed that the tariff was a sole 
supplier provision is largely irrelevant because the state concedes that concern about take-or-pay liability animated Panhandle's 
refusal to transport ""new gas"" for its customers. The question in this case is simply whether that motivation was anticompetitive 
within the meaning of the antitrust laws. "
862,5," The subsequent history of FERC's efforts to resolve the take-or-pay problem are not directly relevant to our case because all of 
Panhandle's challenged conduct took place before Order 436 was vacated. Nevertheless, the years spent by FERC and the 
courts grappling with the issue are instructive, for they provide compelling evidence of the intractable nature of the problem. After 
Order 436 was vacated, FERC next issued Order 500, an interim rule, to temporarily address the take-or-pay problem while 
FERC conducted rulemaking proceedings to comply with the concerns raised in AGD. That order, too, was remanded.

provisions). With Order 500-H, however, FERC finally resolved the take-or-pay problem satisfactorily (with one minor exception). 
See American Gas Ass'n v. FERC, 286 U.S. App. D.C. 142; 912 F.2d 1496 (D.C. Cir. 1990)."
862,6," The state's complaint alleges that the tie was an unlawful restraint of trade violating of § 1 of the Sherman Act, rather than an 
exclusionary practice violating § 2. In its brief on appeal, however, the state describes the tie as an exclusionary practice 
relevant to its § 2 monopolization claim, and, accordingly, that is how we treat it. "
864,7," We do not address the issue of whether Utilicorp bars the state's claims for injunctive relief, as we agree with Panhandle that 
such relief is unavailable because Panhandle now makes its transportation services available to its LDC customers. "
866,8," Alternatively, in the words of FERC: Purchasers of natural gas, seeing the availability of supplies in the field at prices below the rolled-in average cost of all gas, 
are seeking to purchase gas directly in the field and have it transported to the city-gate or burner-tip in competition with the 
system supplies which the pipeline retains under certain uneconomic long-term contracts.  FERC Order 436, 48 Fed. Reg. at 42421."
866,9, The state does not claim that the G tariff was originally violative of the antitrust laws.
866,10," Panhandle disputes these findings, but our agreement with the district court's finding that Panhandle lacked anticompetitive 
intent makes it unnecessary to address them."
866,11," By contrast, the district court did find that Panhandle's adoption of its ""Transportation Guidelines"" for industrial end-users was 
anticompetitive. Id. at 891-94, 921. The district court concluded, however, that Panhandle did not have monopoly power over 
those users, saving it from antitrust liability on that score as well.  Id. at 888, 922."
866,12," United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (""Alcoa""), 148 F.2d 416, 432 (2d Cir. 1945). "
868,13," The district court rejected, however, Panhandle's view that its concern about take-or-pay liability was sufficient to constitute a 
defense, adopting a more narrow view of the type of business justification that constitutes a defense. In the district court's view, 
""it is not a legitimate business justification for antitrust purposes that the defendant sought to protect itself from added costs or 
lost profits."" 730 F. Supp. at 932-33. We do not believe that the distinction among types of business justifications drawn by the district court is a viable one. The 
district court cited Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 380-81, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973), for the 
proposition that only measures that produce ""superior service, lower costs, and improved efficiency"" support a business 
justification defense, without considering that measures designed to avoid higher costs are essentially measures designed to 
lower costs. Whether the lack of business justification is viewed as an element of the offense or the presence of a business 
justification constitutes an affirmative defense goes to the allocation of burdens of proof. It says nothing about the type or quality 
of justification required, and we can see no reason for imposing a more demanding test in one case than the other. "
869,14," The state's claim that Panhandle's status as a utility is irrelevant since it was not required by regulation to enforce its G tariff is 
misleading. Panhandle was required by the FERC, pursuant to the FERC's authority under § 7(a) of the NGA, to extend service 
to many of its customers. Order 436, 50 Fed. Reg. at 42440. To serve all of its customers, Panhandle was required by 
regulation to anticipate their future requirements for natural gas. See, e.g., 18 C.F.R. § 2.61 (generally requiring pipelines to 
demonstrate ability to meet projected demand for next twelve years). Moreover, as the district court observed, ""once a pipeline 
has commenced service . . . it may not abandon or terminate that service unless it first obtains a certificate of abandonment from 
the FERC. A pipeline is required by FERC to continue providing service to an LDC customer even after the expiration of the 
service agreement with the customer."" 730 F. Supp. at 877. In any event, the state exaggerates the significance of a regulatory 
imperative. Whether Panhandle's efforts to enforce the G tariff were required by regulation is not, as the state seems to suggest, 
dispositive of Panhandle's liability. The existence of affirmative regulatory obligations is merely a factor to be considered in 
determining whether a utility's conduct was intentionally anticompetitive. "
870,15," Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel., 700 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1073, 79 L. Ed. 2d 220, 104 
S. Ct. 984 (1984), is distinguishable for the same reason. In Litton, AT&T had filed a tariff with the FCC (which the Commission 
ultimately rejected) that required customers that had purchased equipment from its competitors to purchase an unnecessary 
""interface"" device in order to access AT&T's telephone system. The jury found that AT&T's tariff evidenced its intent to create 
barriers to entry in the telephone equipment market and held it (along with AT&T's efforts to convince the FCC to approve the 
tariff) to be anticompetitive and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Panhandle's tariff, by contrast, had been approved since 1951, 
and Panhandle had assumed long-term contractual obligations in reliance on the tariff. "
877,1," See, e.g., National Farmers' Org., Inc. v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 850 F.2d 1286, 1312 (8th Cir. 1988) (approving 
district court's delay in the determination of costs and attorney's fees pending appeal)."
877,2," Plaintiffs also brought claims against General Motors Acceptance Corporation but its motion for directed verdict was granted at 
the close of all evidence."
877,3," Specifically, the complaint asserted violations of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and the Minnesota Antitrust Act, § 325D.49, 
et seq.; the federal Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1221 et seq.; the Minnesota Motor Vehicle Sale and 
Distribution Regulations Act, Minn. Stat. § 80E.01 et seq.; the Minnesota Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. § 
325D.43 et seq.; common law fraud, promissory estoppel, tortious interference with business relationships, breach of the dealer 
sales and service agreements and violations of the Robinson-Patman and RICO Acts."
877,4," General Motors argued that Donald John Peterson as an individual had no standing to bring the antitrust action. HN1[
] 
Courts generally hold that individuals have no antitrust standing because ""other parties that have been more directly harmed"" 
are available to sue. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n. 6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986); Associated 
General Contractors, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 534-35 & n. 31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 
897 (1983); Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 466-67, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982). At the hearing, "
878,," the court ruled that Donald John Peterson lacked standing to bring the alleged antitrust claim, and thus General Motors' motion 
regarding Donald John Peterson as an individual was granted and judgment will be entered against him on the antitrust claims 
notwithstanding the verdict."
878,5," Plaintiffs introduced another Pirtle memorandum, dated the following day, from which a reasonable jury could also conclude 
that members of the Twin Cities Dealers' Association were acting in concert. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 211). This memorandum also "
879,," indicates that Walser, acting on behalf of the association, requested a meeting with Pirtle but that Pirtle refused to discuss JPMI 
in a meeting with the association."
879,6," Abraham's letter alleges that JPMI's advertising was ""deceptive"" because it compared Pontiac sticker prices with Buick dealer 
prices (although the ad did disclose that the Buick prices were $ 49 over invoice while the Pontiac prices were ""MSRP"", an 
abbreviation for Manufacturers Suggested Retail Prices). The letter suggested that ""the reason for this 'deception' is that [JPMI 
did] not have many Pontiacs for sale, but [did] have Buicks."" "
880,7," Walser also conceded, prior to a memory lapse, that he may have discussed JPMI's marketing program with the ""big brass"" 
from Buick's Motor Division when they came to town. (Walser Deposition pp. 86-87). "
881,8," Some of the ""strategies"" included: limiting the allocations to the discount dealers ""based on some measure of market potential 
in [the] dealer's Area of Primary Responsibility""; limiting allocations based on ""dealer's facilities""; limiting sales to the dealer's 
""Area of Primary Responsibility""; or ""do nothing and let market forces solve problem by allowing survival of fittest."""
881,9," The memo noted that subjects to be discussed during upcoming conference calls included: (A) Any matters relating to pricing are most sensitive and involve anti-trust [sic] problems. (B) Zones are to distribute cars in keeping with the established distribution procedures and are to be very careful, namely, 
do not restrict distribution to Dealers or provide extra cars beyond the earned rate."
881,10," At about the same time, Walser informed Pirtle that because of the decrease in automobile prices resulting from JPMI's 
marketing program, his dealership was forced to resign from the Twin City Buick Dealers' Advertising Association. (Plaintiffs' 
Exhibit No. 213). "
882,11," Plaintiffs introduced evidence that communications between Pirtle and Peterson in early February 1984 did not indicate the 
possibility of any reduction in JPMI's allocation of Buicks. Plaintiffs contended that reductions began almost immediately after 
Pirtle received the Picker memorandum of February 8, 1984, which detailed the increasing number of dealer complaints. 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 212). Donald John Peterson did not receive actual notice of the reduction until several weeks later. "
883,12," In Sharp, Business Electronics was one of two Sharp dealers in Houston. Sharp provided dealers with published lists of 
minimum retail prices but did not require dealers to charge those minimum prices or any other specific price. Business 
Electronics' prices were often below Sharp's suggested retail prices and also below those of Hartwell, the other Sharp dealer in 
Houston. Hartwell complained about Business Electronics' prices, and ultimately advised Sharp that it would terminate its dealer 
agreement if Sharp did not terminate Business Electronics' dealership. Sharp subsequently terminated Business Electronics' 
dealership and Business Electronics brought an antitrust action. The Supreme Court applied the rule of reason standard to the 
facts in Sharp because the agreement between the manufacturer and one dealer to terminate a price cutter constituted a vertical 
nonprice restraint. The Court held that such an arrangement would not per se illegal unless the surviving dealer surrendered its 
pricing discretion and agreed to set prices at some level. Id. at 726-27."
883,13," The Eighth Circuit explained that ""although General Motors involved dual conspiracies, retailer-retailer and retailer-
manufacturer, the [Supreme] Court's application of the per se rule points to the importance of the underlying horizontal nature of 
the arrangement. Substance should be more important than form."" Battle v. Lubrizol Corp., 673 F.2d 984, 989 (8th Cir. 1982) 
(citation omitted) (district court's subsequent grant of summary judgment for defendant was affirmed on other grounds by an 
equally divided court in Battle v. Watson, 712 F.2d 1238 (8th Cir. 1983) (en banc))."
883,14," The Supreme Court noted that the ""discount sales undercut the prices at which franchise dealers were able to, or chose to, 
compete""; that ""dealers and their salesmen complained to General Motors about sales lost through inability to meet the 
discounters' prices""; and that customers chose to do business with the discounters not only because of lower prices but also to 
avoid the necessity of ""haggling over price."" Id. 384 U.S. at 132 n. 7. "
884,15," GM bases its contention on the jury's negative response to the special verdict questions which asked: did General Motors Corporation fail to act in good faith in performing any of the terms of the Dealer's Sales and Service 
Agreements with John Peterson Motors, Inc., such actions amounting to ""coercion, intimidation, or threats of coercion or 
intimidation"" toward the plaintiffs?"
884,16," The commentator specifically relied on: Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 
(1980) (per curiam) (agreement among wholesalers to terminate their practice of extending credit); National Soc'y of 
Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978) (involving an agreement among 
competitors to use specific methods of quoting prices which operated as a complete ban on competitive bidding); United States 
v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (agreement among competitors to buy surplus "
885,," gasoline in order to prevent prices from falling); Sugar Inst. v. United States, 297 U.S. 553, 80 L. Ed. 859, 56 S. Ct. 629 (1936) 
(agreement to adhere to previously announced prices in terms of sales)."
885,17," GM also argues that ""today both horizontal and vertical agreements that directly and indirectly affect (but do not fix) prices are 
judged under the rules of reason."" GM cites various cases to support its argument that even horizontal restraints are now judged 
by the rule of reason. See, e.g., Broadcast Music v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 441 U.S. 1, 23-24, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 
1551 (1979). After Broadcast Music, however, the Supreme Court held that a similar agreement was illegal per se, concluding 
that ""since price-fixing agreements . . . lack any 'redeeming virtue,' it is conclusively presumed [to be] illegal without further 
examination under the rule of reason."" Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 650, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 
(1980) (per curiam). Recent antitrust cases are difficult to reconcile. As one commentator observes: the confusion among the cases has been aggravated by the Court's failure to develop a clear theoretical basis for its new 
approach. The Supreme Court decisions of the late 1970's and 1980's represent a broad philosophical turn in favor of the 
rights of defendants in antitrust cases. However, each of those cases was decided on its own narrow facts. Few rules of 
general application emerge from the Court's case-by-case approach.  Although in several situations the Court deemed it 
appropriate to eschew a traditional per se approach in favor of a consideration of the substantive competitive effects of 
defendants' actions, it never clearly defined which situations require a substantive competitive analysis. It is therefore 
difficult to distinguish the cases in which the Court has applied a [per se] approach from those in which it has engaged in a 
more detailed factual inquiry. Piraino, Reconciling the Per Se and Rule of Reason Approaches to Antitrust Analysis, 64 S. Cal. L. Rev. 685, 705-06 (1991). In analyzing the present case, the court relied on Sharp, which explicitly rejects the notion that horizontal and vertical restraints 
are treated in the same manner: petitioner contends that since certain horizontal agreements have been held to constitute price fixing (and thus to be per se 
illegal) though they did not set prices or price levels, see, e.g., Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647-50, 
64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 (1980) (per curiam), it is improper to require that a vertical agreement set prices or price 
levels before it can suffer the same fate. This notion of equivalence between the scope of horizontal per se illegality and 
that of vertical per se illegality was explicitly rejected in [Continental T.V., Inc., v.] GTE Sylvania, [97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 
2d 568 (1977)], n.27, 433 U.S. at [36] 57 -- as it had to be, since a horizontal agreement to divide territories is per se illegal, 
see United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, [31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126] (1972), while GTE 
Sylvania held that a vertical agreement to do so is not."
885,485," U.S. at 733-34; see also Piraino, Sharp Dealing, 38 Emory L.J. at 330 (noting that ""in cases involving agreements among 
competitors, the [Supreme] Court has consistently held that even an indirect effect on prices is sufficient to invoke the per se 
rule"" (footnote omitted))."
885,18," On the facts of the present case, the key inquiry is not whether a price restraint is involved but rather whether the agreement is 
horizontal or vertical because Sharp affirms the fact that historically the per se rule has been applied to horizontal nonprice and 
price restraints. 485 U.S. at 734-35 (stating that the Court has applied the per se rule to: horizontal agreements that are deemed 
price fixing without setting prices or price levels, such as Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647-50, 64 L. Ed. 2d 
580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 (1980) (per curiam); horizontal price fixing cases involving explicit agreements, including United States v. 
Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960); horizontal agreements to divide territories, such as 
United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972); and horizontal boycotts of a 
price cutter, including United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 140, 143-45, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 1321 
(1966)). The Court noted with approval that all of those cases applied the per se rule because they involved horizontal rather 
than vertical restraints. "
886,19," But see Piraino, Sharp Dealing: The Horizontal/Vertical Dichotomy in Distributor Termination Cases, 38 Emory L.J. 311 (1989) 
(arguing that the Supreme Court should abandon the price/nonprice dichotomy and apply the per se rule when a manufacturer 
terminates a dealer as a result of pressure by its other dealers)."
886,20," In analyzing hybrid restraints, that is restraints with both horizontal and vertical components resulting from an agreement 
between dealers and also an agreement between dealers and a manufacturer, the Supreme Court stated that ""a facially vertical 
restraint imposed by a manufacturer only because it has been coerced by a 'horizontal cartel' agreement among . . . distributors 
is in reality a horizontal restraint."" Id. (citing R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288 (1978)); see also Piraino, Distributor 
Terminations Pursuant to Conspiracies Among a Supplier and Complaining Distributors: A Suggested Antitrust Analysis, 67 
Cornell L. Rev. 297, 298 (1982) (stating that ""although the form of such a 'mixed termination' conspiracy may be vertical, the 
competitive purpose and effect of the conspiracy is more similar to horizontal conspiracies that exclude competitors of the 
conspirators from a market"")."
886,21," Using the per se rule comports with the economic justification for the distinction between horizontal and vertical restraints. 
HN7[
] As one commentator stated: when a manufacturer is not acting for his own competitive purposes in terminating a distributor, but is merely acceding to 
the desires of one or more of his dealers that a competitor be terminated, it is appropriate to apply the per se rule. Such a 
termination amounts to a naked restraint of trade with no purpose except stifling competition. In such a case, the Sylvania 
rationale in favor of the rule of reason does not apply. Instead of acting to enhance his interbrand competitiveness, the 
manufacturer is merely aiding his distributors in a horizontal scheme to limit competition.  The dealers initiating the restraint 
must enlist the manufacturer to participate in the conspiracy in order to effect the elimination of their competitor from the 
market. The manufacturer's participation lends a superficial vertical appearance to the termination, but the substantive 
competitive purpose and effect of the termination is horizontal because it has been instigated by the dealers. Piraino, Sharp Dealing, 38 Emory L.J. at 344-45 (footnotes omitted); HN8[
] see also 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1453c (1986), which states that: a restraint can be vertical in form without being the product of the manufacturer's free choice. He may adopt it in order to 
retain a particular dealer or group of dealers who demand such restraints on their competitors as a condition of continuing 
to deal with the manufacturer. If so, a court would be entirely correct to characterize the agreement that appears to be vertical in form as a restraint on 
'horizontal competition.' Id. (citation omitted).HN9[
] Courts have recognized that ""the coerced exclusion of discount rivals from the market place solely because of their pricing 
policies"" impairs competition as much as price fixing agreements. See, e.g., Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse v. Belk Bros. 
Co., 621 F. Supp. 224, 233 n.18 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). GM's actions also may have warned other dealers that the use of marketing 
programs like JPMI's would not be tolerated. For example: "
887,," under Monsanto, such a signal could be evidence of the manufacturer's attempt to police a general resale price-fixing 
scheme. The verdict against Monsanto was upheld by the Court partially on the basis of a newsletter to distributors 
indicating that Monsanto would terminate distributors who did not comply with its policy on resale pricing. Piraino, Sharp Dealing, 38 Emory L.J. at 330 n. 90 (citing Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 765-66, 79 L. 
Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)). GM never terminated JPMI's dealership. The jury found, however, that GM restricted JPMI's allocation of vehicles. Plaintiffs 
contended that this restriction operated in much the same way as an outright dealer termination because the reduction forced 
JPMI to either abandon its marketing program, in which case plaintiffs presented evidence to show that it was unlikely that JPMI 
would be profitable because in the past when it had operated as a conventional dealer it lost money because its area of primary 
responsibility was too small and economically depressed to sustain a conventional dealer, or JPMI could choose to continue with 
its marketing program, and eventually go out of business because it would not be able to generate sufficient volume to turn a 
profit at the $ 49 over invoice prices."
887,22," GM further argues that the jury questions so worded that it was impossible to produce answers that could support a finding of 
antitrust liability. The court rejects this contention because the jury instructions followed the Supreme Court's analysis in Sharp 
regarding the distinctions between horizontal and vertical conspiracies and its explanation of why the General Motors case 
involved a horizontal restraint."
887,23," Plaintiffs introduced evidence that demonstrated that JPMI's marketing program operated to decrease automobile prices in the 
Twin Cities' area and that as a result, the other dealers became very concerned. Arthur Cobb, one of GM's experts, documented 
the effect that the $ 49 and over advertising had on the Twin Cities' market and conceded that the program had a downward 
impact on the price of new General Motor vehicles in the Twin Cities. (Defendant's Exhibit nos. 810-815). Jack Walser, president 
of the Twin City Buick Dealers' Advertising Association, complained to Pirtle about the fact that JPMI's advertising was forcing 
other dealers to decrease their prices. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 211). Later, Walser threatened to resign from the Buick Dealers' 
Advertising Association because his ""grosses"" were being hurt by $ 200 to $ 300. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 213). Mark Picker, 
district manager for Buick, further noted that JPMI's activities resulted in dealer complaints and had a negative impact on sales 
people and dealers as well as precipitating a decrease in sales at Twin City General Motors' dealers. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 212). 
The Cadillac Dealers' Council organization also pressured General Motors to do something to stop ""over invoice"" pricing. 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 215)."
887,24," GM reduced JPMI's allocations to be ""somewhat in line with planning potential"". (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 511). Planning potential, 
however, was a factor never before used by General Motors for allocating vehicles and plaintiffs contend that the planning 
potential program was adopted in order to confine JPMI sales activities to its area of primary responsibility and minimize the 
effects of the $ 49 and over program on prices charged by other Twin City area dealers. "
888,25," GM also argues that causation was not established because the jury found that GM complied with its contractual obligations. 
The jury, however, only found that GM's actions did not rise to the level of ""coercion, intimidation, or threats of coercion or 
intimidation."" This analysis is also flawed because the contract and antitrust claims are not parallel: GM could comply with the 
letter of its contractual obligations and still be guilty of using its allocation system for an improper antitrust purpose, for example, 
to fix or stabilize prices. General Motors further contends that earlier orders of the bankruptcy court are dispositive regarding the reason for JPMI's 
failure. See In re John Peterson Motors, Inc., 47 Bankr. 551 (D. Minn. 1985). The court, however, determined that those 
bankruptcy orders did not conclusively establish the reason for JPMI's failure. First, the orders did not purport to determine the 
cause of the failure, although the bankruptcy court stated that either ""fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement"" 
was involved. Id. at 552. The parties also did not have the opportunity to fully litigate the causation issue before the bankruptcy 
court. During trial, both sides presented extensive evidence and had a full opportunity to litigate the cause of JPMI's failure. GM 
presented extensive evidence regarding the various explanations that were listed by the bankruptcy court. The jury nonetheless 
determined that GM's actions were a substantial cause of JPMI's failure."
888,26," Moreover, even if other causes contributed to JPMI's failure, damages attributable to GM's antitrust violation are recoverable 
even though factors other than the antitrust injury may have contributed to the damages. Cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n. 9, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969) (analyzing damages under § 4 of the Clayton 
Act). A plaintiff is not required to exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in order to recover damages; it is sufficient that 
the antitrust violation be a material cause of the injury. Id. Jury Instruction No. 22 adequately summarized this standard for the 
jury. "
890,27," The court further notes that Minnesota federal courts commonly ask the jury to determine a dollar amount of damages 
resulting from a given event without regard to whether a defendant was liable for the event to minimize the risk of retrial after 
appeal. "

assuming a fiduciary duty exists, the issue here is not whether some term of the distribution agreement purports to release 
Panasonic from liability for some prior breach, but instead whether Panasonic's terminating this particular agreement without 
cause could itself legally constitute a breach."

909,*," Honorable Robert F. Peckham, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation. "
910,1, Tidmore has not appealed the adverse judgment on the claim under the PMPA. 
911,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in pertinent part, provides that HN6[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
912,3," Although a simple refusal to deal fails to state a claim under section 1, such an act could be relevant to a claim under section 2, 
the monopoly provision.  Mr. Furniture Warehouse, Inc. v. Barclays American/Commercial Inc., 919 F.2d 1517, 1522 (11th Cir. 
1990). Section 2 proscribes a unilateral refusal to deal ""when accompanied by the intent to monopolize and the requisite degree 
of monopoly power."" Id. at 1522. Plaintiff, however, has not alleged a section 2 claim, nor, on these facts, does it appear that 
such a claim could be made. "
913,4," In light of our holding that no agreement existed, we need not resolve whether an agreement between Tidmore and BP should 
be analyzed as a horizontal restraint because BP acts as a dual distributor. It is doubtful, however, that the mere fact that BP 
acts as both a supplier and a dealer would convert a vertical restraint into a horizontal one. See, e.g., Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. 
Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 720-21 (11th Cir. 1984) (noting trend of courts to view dual distributor and independent 
franchisee as vertical relationship). See also Department of Justice, Vertical Restraint Guidelines, 50 Fed. Reg. 6263, 6265 
(1985) (announcing Department policy). "
914,5," Although Tidmore is correct in noting that BP stipulated that it ""has never said that the decision was based upon density,"" it 
would be misleading not to point out that this stipulation referred only to the rejection of Tidmore's proposed site in 1986, not to 
the rejection in 1988. (Joint Statement of Generally Undisputed Facts, R2-56- para. 15). "
915,6," Tidmore has, in addition, appealed the district court's denial of leave to amend its complaint. This decision is reviewable only 
for abuse of discretion.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). We 
find that the district court correctly denied the motions on the grounds of futility and undue delay.  Local 472 of United Ass'n of 
Journeymen and Apprentices v. Georgia Power Co., 684 F.2d 721, 724 (11th Cir. 1982). "
927,1," The NOGA agreement specifically states the purpose of the agreement, as follows: ""[Roxborough] desires to assure the availability of community based obstetrics and gynecological services to patients in [its] 
service area and to that end has established a business and organizational framework to enable several physicians to offer such 
services at several offices owned and operated by [Roxborough] under the name. . .NOGA."" This purpose is not improper."
927,2," The Third Circuit in Cromar discussed how a court should determine when a plaintiff suing under § 4 of the Clayton Act has 
standing to sue. It stated: Courts must look to among other factors, the nature of the industry in which the alleged antitrust violation exists, the relationship 
of the plaintiff to the alleged violator, and the alleged effect of the antitrust violation upon plaintiff. Then, while recognizing that 
breaches of the antitrust laws have effects throughout society, a court must decide whether this plaintiff is one 'whose protection 
is the fundamental purpose of the antitrust laws'."" "
928,3, In light of this ruling the court need not reach the question of standing to sue raised by defendants. 
934,1," Companhia Fabricadora de Pecas and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cofap of America, Inc., are herein referred to collectively 
as Cofap."
934,2," ITC's Complaint alleges that Suspa is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Suspa Germany. Suspa asserts in its Brief in Support of its 
Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 10) that, while there is some commonality of ownership between Suspa and Suspa Germany, Suspa 
is not a subsidiary of Suspa Germany. "
935,3, A schematic outlining the relationship between the parties is attached to this opinion as Exhibit A.
935,4," ITC's federal antitrust action is brought pursuant to § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, to recover treble damages for injury 
to its business by reason of Defendants' alleged violations of §§ 1 and 2 of of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2. Since § 4 
of the Clayton Act provides the vehicle by which private parties may bring suit for violations of the antitrust laws, including the 
Sherman Act, ""standing"" refers to standing under § 4 of the Clayton Act. See P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 331 
(1978). In other words, a party which lacks standing under § 4 of the Clayton Act has no private antitrust remedy for violations of 
the Sherman Act. "
936,5," The fact that ITC is not a market participant does not necessarily preclude standing. In a line of case beginning with Southaven 
Land Co. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079 (6th Cir. 1983), the Sixth Circuit has recognized that a plaintiff who is neither a "
937,," consumer nor a competitor may still have standing if his injury is ""inextricably intertwined"" with the injury sought to be inflicted on 
the relevant market. ""An inextricably intertwined injury is one that results from the manipulation of the injured party as a means to 
carry out the restraint of trade in the product market."" Province, 787 F.2d at 1052. In this case, ITC has not alleged that its injury is inextricably intertwined with the injury that Defendants sought to inflict upon the 
market. In fact, since the Complaint states that ITC refused to cooperate in Defendants' price-fixing and market allocating 
activities, it has not been manipulated as a means of carrying out a restraint of trade. Moreover, even if Defendants utilized ITC 
as the economic fulcrum to inflict harm upon the market, the alleged injury to ITC was a result of such activity, not a means. "
938,6," In fact, the Court notes that, even prior to filing its Complaint in the captioned case, ITC commenced a breach of contract action 
against Cofap in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. That action has been removed to this Court and docketed 
as Case No. C-3-90-147. "
962,*," The Honorable James K. Singleton, United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation. "
975,1," Because Dale and George Chinnici did not file their Countermotion to Dismiss State Claims until after answering the Amended 
Complaint, their cross-motion will be treated as one for judgment on the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c); see 2A Moore's 
Federal Practice para. 12.15, at 12-104 to 12-105 (2d ed. 1990). The Court will not consider matters outside the pleadings which 
were submitted by the parties. Therefore, the cross-motion of Dale and George Chinnici will not be treated as one for summary 
judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)."
975,2," Abramowitz also worked in Camden, New Jersey, as an Industrial Specialist with the Defense Contract Administration Service 
and was responsible for contract management, quality assurance, and financial management of contracts awarded by DPSC. "
976,3," There is no dispute that under Pennsylvania law, plaintiff's common law claims of intentional interference with prospective 
business relations, fraud, and conspiracy would be governed by a two-year statute of limitations. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 
5524(7). It is also undisputed that under New York law, plaintiff's fraud and conspiracy claims would be governed by a six-year 
statute of limitations, N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. 213(8), and that the tortious interference claim would be governed by a three-year 
limitations period, N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. 214(4). "
977,4," Dale and George Chinnici argue that the antitrust claim should be governed by the two-year limitations period which applies to 
""an action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property,"" 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5524(3), and to ""any other action or 
proceeding to recover damages for injury to . . . property which is founded on negligent, intentional, or otherwise tortious conduct 
or any other action or proceeding sounding in trespass, including deceit or fraud, except an action or proceeding subject to 
another limitation specified in this subchapter,"" id. § 5524(7)."
977,5," See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 130, at 1013-14 (5th ed. 1984) (noting 
overlap in the purposes of the tort of interference with business prospects and antitrust law)."
977,6," The Donnelly Act includes a four-year statute of limitations. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340(5). To the extent Pennsylvania's 
borrowing statute would require the application of New York's shorter limitations period, plaintiff's Donnelly Act claim is not time-
barred. The final bribe allegedly paid by Dale and George Chinnici was in January 1987, and the original complaint was filed a 
little more than two years later on May 4, 1989."
977,7," The bald assertion by Dale and George Chinnici that discovery of the requested financial documents is unnecessary because 
plaintiff has already received FBI and DCIS statements and all documents relating to the guilty pleas of various defendants is 
insufficient to satisfy their burden of establishing that plaintiff can obtain the information sought through alternative sources. "
978,8," Under controlling Pennsylvania choice of law principles, the Court must determine which jurisdiction has the greatest ""interest 
in the problem and . . . is the most intimately concerned with the outcome."" See In re Complaint of Bankers Trust Co., 752 
F.2d 874, 882 (3d Cir. 1984). This determination is made by evaluating the nature of the contacts that the relevant states have 
with respect to the controversy and making a qualitative appraisal of the relevant states' policies in regard to the controversy. 
Melville v. American Home Assurance Co., 584 F.2d 1306, 1311 (3d Cir. 1978). Punitive damages serve to punish a defendant and to deter future misconduct. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(1) (1979). 
Accordingly, in addressing a choice of laws question on the issue of punitive damages, the Court must consider where the 
alleged misconduct occurred and, if dealing with a corporate defendant, the state of incorporation and its principal place of 
business. See Serbin Dev. Corp. v. North River Ins. Co., No. 85-4273 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 8, 1986) (O'Neill, J.) (predicting that 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court will adopt such a test based on choice of law analyses in other jurisdictions that relied on choice of 
law principles similar to those of Pennsylvania). Plaintiff contends that New York law should be applied because the effects of defendants' alleged criminal and fraudulent 
behavior, including bankruptcy, were felt in New York by a New York corporation. However, the Amended Complaint contains no 
specific allegation of misconduct that occurred in New York; moreover, none of the defendants is a citizen of New York. Thus, 
New York's interest in having its laws applied to the issue of punitive damages is not particularly strong. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have a much greater interest in having their state's laws applied. All eleven defendants, are 
citizens of either New Jersey or Pennsylvania. Moreover, the defendants allegedly met in these states to plan payment of bribes 
and paid bribes in these states. As between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Court finds that Pennsylvania has the most 
significant interest in having its laws applied because DPSC, which is responsible for awarding military clothing contracts and 
employed the officials who were allegedly bribed by the defendant clothing manufacturers, is located in Philadelphia. "

987,1," There was some testimony that the City had for some time operated a remote parking lot which was used as an overflow lot at 
peak times."
987,2," Those roads are public rights-of-way. See City and County of Denver v. Publix Cab Co., 135 Colo. 132, 308 P.2d 1016 (1957)."
987,3," The district court found that ""there's a doubling back which both affects the time, the convenience of the passengers, and the 
costs to the plaintiffs of running those shuttles."" Transcript of Ruling of the Court at 9. "
988,4," Plaintiffs' expert, Dean C. Coddington, prepared a ""Market Analysis and Impact Assessment of Shuttle Bus Parking, Stapleton 
International Airport."" Plaintiffs' Exhibit 100, Addendum Tab 100. The district court incorporated by reference the relevant 
portions of that Exhibit. That Exhibit showed that, in 1984, plaintiff Allright had 62.1% of the off-site parking market, plaintiff 
Monaco had 37.4% of that market, and SMART and plaintiffs Premier and Continental had 0%. By 1989, SMART's share had 
increased to 45%, whereas Allright's had declined to 24.1%, Monaco's had declined to 18.3% and Premier and Continental had 
market shares of 4.9% and 7.7% respectively. Mr. Coddington projected that by 1994, SMART would have more than 50% of 
that market, whereas the four plaintiffs would have less than 50%. The Exhibit also included an analysis of the impact of SMART 
on plaintiffs' revenues, and an analysis of the marketing efforts of SMART and plaintiffs."
988,5," They initially also alleged a violation of Colorado state antitrust laws, but voluntarily dismissed that claim before trial."
988,6," Simultaneously with their complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which resulted in a hearing, 
converted by agreement of the parties to a hearing for a preliminary injunction. The hearing was, however, continued because 
the parties reached an interim agreement to not require payment of the new fees or require plaintiffs to sign the permit 
agreement until January 1, 1990. The fees are nonetheless accruing. "
989,7," The court ruled from the bench and did not reduce its ruling to writing. The court's reasoning for rejecting plaintiffs' 
monopolization claim is not completely clear. The court stated: Now, the evidence does not establish that Denver is a monopolist here and in this aspect of the analysis, it is important, I 
think, to bring in the limitations on what Denver can do as a government, so in this sense there is a necessity, I think, to 
overlap the principles and recognize that Denver can't be a monopolist and, as I said in colloquy with plaintiffs' counsel, 
Denver doesn't claim and certainly doesn't have the power to simply preclude the plaintiffs from accessing this airport by 
saying, ""We are going to be the exclusive shuttle parking services provider for Stapleton International Airport."" It can't do 
that because of other limitations on it as a government, which, of course, involves the concepts in these other claims. So in a very real sense, here I have to accept the plaintiffs' view that there is a confluence of principles because they can't 
become a monopoly in that way, and additionally, as we'll see in a moment, they can't use their ability to extract charges as 
conditions for the entry here to an extent that is unreasonable; in other words, there are limits to the rates that they can 
charge, the fees for access and they're the very limits that are being claimed in the other claims for relief, and that's another 
reason why the city can't be in the position of a monopolist with respect to this service in this market. Therefore, plaintiffs 
have failed to prove a Section II, a Sherman II violation in this case. Transcript of Ruling of the Court at 11-12."
989,8," Oberndorf was the first opinion in this circuit to frame the municipal immunity question in terms of two parts. We there noted 
that ""we must consider two prerequisites to proper application of the state action exception to municipal action."" 900 F.2d at 
1438. Because in that case the Colorado Urban Renewal Law manifestly evidenced a clearly articulated and expressly stated "
990,," policy to displace competition, we focused our inquiry on whether the City's actions were authorized by that law. In Jacobs, 
Visconsi & Jacobs Co., we called the inquiry a ""two-part test."" 927 F.2d at 1120. In practice, of course, the two parts will not 
always have equal prominence. See Oberndorf, 900 F.2d at 1438-39. In City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 
U.S. 365, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991), the Supreme Court recently stated that the inquiry into municipal ""authority 
to regulate"" will not be an exacting one: In order to prevent Parker from undermining the very interests of federalism it is designed to protect, it is necessary to 
adopt a concept of authority broader than what is applied to determine the legality of the municipality's action under state 
law. . . . It suffices for the present to conclude that here no more is needed to establish, for Parker purposes, the city's 
authority to regulate than its unquestioned zoning power over the size, location, and spacing of billboards. "
990,111," S. Ct. at 1350. The two parts of the inquiry are designed to answer the central question--whether there is a ""clearly 
articulated and affirmatively expressed policy"" to displace competition.  Hallie, 471 U.S. at 44. "
991,9," We reject plaintiffs' argument that Denver is authorized to own and operate Stapleton by Article XX of the Colorado constitution, 
the ""home rule"" provision, instead of by other statutory provisions more specifically relating to airports. In Sterling Beef Co. v. 
City of Fort Morgan, 810 F.2d 961 (10th Cir. 1987), this court noted that the home rule provision in the constitution ""round[s] out 
the basic authority"" contained in the particular statute conferring upon the city of Fort Morgan, a home rule city, the authority to 
engage in the allegedly anticompetitive acts challenged there. The primary focus of our opinion in Sterling Beef was on the 
particular statutes, not the home rule provision. Under Boulder, it is clear that the grant of home rule authority by itself is an 
insufficient expression of state policy to displace competition."
991,10," It appears that the city and county of Denver is considered a ""county"" under the Public Airport Authority Law, Colo. Rev. Stat. 
§§ 41-3-101 to 108. "
993,11," Defendants also rely on our opinion in Pueblo Aircraft Serv. v. City of Pueblo, 679 F.2d 805 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 
U.S. 1126, 74 L. Ed. 2d 977, 103 S. Ct. 762 (1983), in which we held that the city of Pueblo, Colorado was immune from antitrust 
liability in its dealings with fixed base operators at its municipal airport. We did so in reliance upon Colo. Rev. Stat. § 41-4-101, 
upon which defendants in this case also rely, and which, as indicated above, states that the maintenance and operation of 
airports are ""public governmental functions, exercised for a public purpose, and matters of public necessity."" While noting that 
typically a municipal airport is properly viewed as a ""proprietary"" activity, in the face of an explicit statute such as section 41-4-
101, we felt compelled in Pueblo Aircraft to recognize immunity for the operation of the Pueblo airport as a ""public governmental 
function."" We do not base our finding of immunity in this case on that statute or on the rationale of Pueblo Aircraft. The distinction between 
proprietary activities and governmental functions upon which our Pueblo Aircraft opinion was based has at times formed the 
basis for determinations of immunity. See, e.g., City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 
98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978) (Burger, C.J., concurring) (state authorization necessary for immunity because defendant municipalities in 
that case were engaged in ""proprietary"" activities); Padgett v. Louisville and Jefferson County Air Board, 492 F.2d 1258 (6th Cir. 
1974) (Air Board's award of contract to one taxicab company immune from antitrust challenge because Board ""was exercising a 
valid governmental function to which the antitrust laws do not apply""); E.W. Wiggins Airways, Inc. v. Mass. Port Auth., 362 F.2d 
52 (1st Cir.) (decision by Port Authority to enter into exclusive lease with fixed base operator was immune from antitrust 
challenge as ""the exercise of a valid governmental function""), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 947, 87 S. Ct. 320, 17 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1966). 
It appears to us that the distinction between proprietary and governmental functions has not been pursued in recent Supreme 
Court opinions. In Hallie, for example, the Court simply considered whether the relevant statutes contained the requisite clear 
and express authorization. It did not consider whether the city's actions were proprietary or governmental. See also P. Areeda & 
H. Hovencamp, Antitrust Law, para. 212.2e (Supp. 1990) (in criticizing Chief Justice Burger's position in his Lafayette 
concurrence, the authors noted that ""decisions since Lafayette have essentially ignored any distinction between proprietary and 
other functions""); In Re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 521 F. Supp. 568, 583 (N.D. Cal. 1981) (""municipal antitrust 
liability does not turn on the distinction between commercial/proprietary and governmental activities. . . . If the opinions in 
Lafayette make anything clear, it is that this distinction was unacceptable to eight of the nine members of the Court.""), aff'd, 693 
F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1133, 103 S. Ct. 3114, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1368 (1983). Cf.  City of Columbia v. Omni 
Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 1351 (1991) (no conspiracy exception to state 
action immunity, with possible exception of when state acts ""not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a 
given market"")."
993,12," Plaintiffs' shuttle buses and the City's SMART buses do not, however, perform identical services. As the district court found, 
SMART buses perform the additional job of transporting passengers between concourses, and not just to remote parking lots. "
995,13," For example, the court noted that the Airport Authority could rationally conclude that hotel and motel operators would 
discontinue service if they were charged any higher fee, since the airport courtesy vehicle service is not an indispensible part of 
their business."
995,14," As a further explanation for why it concluded that plaintiffs derive a greater benefit from the Airport, the district court noted that 
""the plaintiffs clearly wouldn't be in business at all but for this airport, and their whole business is to provide the parking services "
996,," for people enplaning at this airport."" Transcript of Ruling of the Court at 19-20. Shuttle bus services to hotels, resorts and ski 
resorts, by contrast, would still be in business even if the Airport, for example, banned all private shuttle bus services from the 
premises. Although they could not pick up passengers at the Airport, they could still provide a service to people travelling to 
hotels, motels or ski resorts, albeit from a different pick-up location."
996,15," Additionally, as airport officials testified, defendants believed that it would be illogical to charge SMART buses the user fee 
because there would be no net gain of funds. Rather, the fee would be paid out from one part of the City's operations and paid 
into another. Exempting SMART buses from the fee is therefore consistent with the legitimate governmental objective of raising 
revenue. "
1002,1," The landowners (Block 173 Associates and Oberndorf) filed separate state and federal claims. The court of appeals, however, 
held that all Oberndorf claims were disposed of by the federal court decision, and, because no cross-petition for certiorari was 
filed, that decision is not before us. The issue before us, then, involves only the two Block 173 Associates' claims preserved by 
the court of appeals."
1002,2," HN2[
] Section 31-25-103(2) provides: "
1003,," (2) ""Blighted area"" means an area which, by reason of the presence of a substantial number of slum, deteriorated, or 
deteriorating structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street layout, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, 
accessibility, or usefulness, unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or other improvements, unusual topography, 
defective or unusual conditions of title rendering the title nonmarketable, or the existence of conditions which endanger life or 
property by fire and other causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the 
municipality, retards the provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic or social liability, and is a menace to 
the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition and use."
1003,3," Shortly after the two cases were filed, and after discovery in the federal case commenced, the Denver district court ordered a 
stay of the state case. On a motion for reconsideration, the landowner argued that the stay should remain in effect because the 
issues and claims in both cases were identical. See transcript of November 26, 1986, hearing (R. III). Over the defendants' 
objections, the district court preserved the stay. The landowner now argues that, while a federal district court decision actually resolving this case on the merits would have 
barred the state claims, the federal resolution by means of summary judgment does not."
1003,4," The fact that the three blocks dedicated to Centerstone were not blighted did not prevent those blocks from being included in 
the urban renewal plan. See Rabinoff v. District Court, 145 Colo. 225, 237-38, 360 P.2d 114, 121 (1961). "
1004,5," In its brief before this court, the landowner admits the ""defendants were certainly clever enough to follow the procedural 
requirements of the statute they chose to achieve their purposes."" "
1005,6," Exhibit A is the urban renewal plan dated May 13, 1986; Exhibit B is the underlying ordinance adopted by the city authorizing 
the plan. "
1006,7," All parties concede the constitutional claims brought in both the state and federal action have been disposed of by the federal 
court."
1006,8," We are not presented with the issue of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning the presence of bad faith in 
absence of the applicability of collateral estoppel. The state trial court ruling was predicated solely on collateral estoppel and res 
judicata."
1006,9," Eastern R.R. President's Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523 , 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United 
Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585 , 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
1008,10," HN14[
] The United States Supreme Court has recently refused to recognize a conspiracy or bribery exception to the Noerr-
Pennington and Parker doctrines, reasoning that public entities are entitled to greater immunity than private when taking 
anticompetitive action for a public purpose. City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising,    U.S.   , 59 U.S.L.W. 4262-64. The 
Court did not go so far as to eliminate this exception for private entities or for a public entity acting as a ""market participant."" Id. 
at 4263. Furthermore, that holding does not in any way undermine the findings of the federal district court that, if such an 
exception existed, it would not be satisfied in this case."
1008,11," The Matsushita standard differs from the standard applied to summary judgment motions in federal and Colorado state court: 
HN15[
] the entry of summary judgment against a party is mandated when all pleadings, affidavits, and admissions are 
construed in that party's favor, but the party fails to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case on which 
that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548 , 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(1986). "
1015,1," In a letter dated May 7, 1991, Dr. Brown sought a continuance of his trial date due to certain personal circumstances. As the 
matters before the court have already been fully briefed and argued, this request for a continuance does not affect the court's 
consideration of the instant motions in any manner."
1015,2," Plaintiff failed to provide the court with a transcript of the hearings before the Magistrate Judge from which he appeals as 
required by General Rule 40(D)(4)(a). Nonetheless, the court will consider his motions on the merits. "
1017,3," Many of the documents plaintiff submitted to the court have unnumbered pages. Where page numbers are available, the court 
will cite to a specific page. Otherwise, page references will be omitted. "
1022,4," Dr. Brown points to the Supreme Court's decision in Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 108 S. Ct. 1658, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1988) in 
support of the proposition that medical peer review proceedings are not exempt from federal antitrust laws. This court fully 
accepts that proposition; however, Patrick does not lift the burden remaining with plaintiff to come forward with evidence at this 
time tending to establish a violation of the federal antitrust laws in order to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment. "
1023,5," The court will address plaintiff's failure to come forward with evidence of the relevant geographic market and defendants' ability 
to exert market dominance in that market in conjunction with its discussion of plaintiff's claim pursuant to § 2 of the Sherman Act. 
Nevertheless, the court's holdings concerning those topics apply with equal force as to plaintiff's claim pursuant to § 1, see 
Doctors Steuer & Latham, P.A., 672 F. Supp. at 1503-04, and constitute additional grounds upon which the court grants 
summary judgment to defendants as to plaintiff's claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1024,6," Plaintiff claims that his failure to present such evidence ""is, in part, a consequence of the thwarted discovery, 'walk out' 
depositions."" Affidavit by Plaintiff in Response to Motion for Summary Judgment. It does not appear, however, that plaintiff ever 
sought market dominance information during discovery. "
1025,7," Dr. Brown did submit a letter from Verner S. Waite, M.D., F.A.C.S., the Executive Secretary of the Senmelweis Society which 
Dr. Brown calls an expert report. In that letter, Dr. Waite makes general comments on medical peer review procedures in the 
United States. He does not comment on the procedures utilized by defendants, nor does he provide any information concerning 
the relevant geographic market or defendants' ability to exert market dominance. This letter does not raise a genuine issue of 
material fact."
1025,8," Plaintiff cites Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 108 S. Ct. 1658, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1988) for the proposition that state action is 
implicated in a medical peer review proceeding. Plaintiff misunderstands the importance of Patrick as it dealt with state antitrust 
immunity, not whether there was state action pursuant to § 1983. "
1032,1," While Metro is owned by the DeKalb Board of Realtors, Thompson and most of the members of the Empire Real Estate Board 
would be under the jurisdiction of the Atlanta Board of Realtors if they joined the Realtors."
1032,2," Because the plaintiffs have not specifically appealed the district court's disposition of the Fair Housing Act claims, the plaintiffs 
have waived any objection to summary judgment on this issue. "
1034,3," It is important to recognize that Thompson and Empire are not alleging that they are either actual competitors or potential 
competitors in the market for multilist services. Therefore, they are not alleging that Metro has harmed them by excluding them 
from the market. They are alleging harm because Metro has raised its prices and because Metro forces its users to join the 
Realtors."
1034,4," As will be discussed below, see section II C 1, infra, the parties do dispute whether there is a second product market, the 
market for professional affiliation. "
1035,5," This case is an example of how the process of defining the parameters of the product markets and the geographic markets can 
be viewed as somewhat interchangeable. See Landes & Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv.L.Rev. 937, 981 
(1981). We could, for example, refer to the product market as those multilist services specializing in the south Atlanta real estate 
market or we could define the product market as multilist services and the geographic market as the south side of Atlanta. In the 
end, it makes little difference how one approaches the problem as long as the end result, the definition of the market, is correct. "
1037,6," Metro raises a second argument which is virtually indistinguishable from the first argument. Metro initially argues that a multilist 
service would be useless without the support services provided by the Realtors. Metro argues in the alternative that multilist 
services and the Realtors' other services are in fact one product because they function as one product. Such an argument, if it 
actually is distinct from the first argument, is nonetheless equally irrelevant to the question of whether the markets are in fact 
separate. Moreover, the Jefferson Parish Hospital Court explicitly found that such a functional analysis is irrelevant to the 
question of whether there are, or are not, separate markets.  Id. 466 U.S. at 19 n. 30, 104 S. Ct. at 1562 n. 30."
1037,7," This assertion may come as a surprise to the members of the Realtors who pay several hundred dollars a year for membership 
and to the DeKalb Board of Realtors official who, in an interrogatory, listed 27 services provided by the Realtors."
1037,8," The Court in Tic-X-Press required the plaintiffs to prove both tying and coercion to satisfy this element and to prove market 
power and coercion to satisfy the third element of tying analysis. We have chosen to reformulate the test to simplify the analysis. 
Under this reformulation, plaintiffs must prove that the products were tied and then, for the third element, plaintiffs must prove 
that the defendants have sufficient market power to coerce buyers. Therefore, a plaintiff must prove coercion only once. This 
reformulation has no substantive effect other than bringing some analytical clarity to an otherwise murky area. "
1039,9," Metro dismisses Empire's affidavit about lost members as ""conclusory, self-serving and factually unsupported."" As for Metro's 
claim that the affidavit is self-serving, we would be surprised if any party ever submitted an affidavit that was not self-serving. 
Moreover, this attack on the credibility of the witness is inappropriate during a motion for summary judgment. See Anderson v. 
Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). As for Metro's claim that the affidavit was 
factually unsupported, the affiant was an officer of Empire who spoke about her personal knowledge of the membership."
1039,10," The plaintiffs also claim that the dollar amounts are substantial because there is support in the record that Thompson and 
others have lost thousands of dollars in lost sales due to their lack of access to a multilisting service. However this loss is not a 
loss within the tied market because the tied market is the market for professional affiliation. "
1040,11," The plaintiffs could also prove a not insubstantial effect on the tying market by determining how much money the Realtors 
make from brokers who join the Realtors solely in order to use the multilisting service."
1040,12," Arguably, though, the economic interest prong has already been implicitly limited to franchise cases since the economic 
interest prong has been ignored in nonfranchise cases. See Tic-X-Press, supra. This prong has also been criticized by other 
courts. See Gonzalez v. St. Margaret's House Housing Development Fund Corp., 880 F.2d 1514 (2d Cir. 1989). "
1042,13," Of course, the Realtors are free on remand to raise other justifications for the realtor membership requirements. "
1043,14," In their complaint, the plaintiffs also bring a conspiracy claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act. Despite the fact that section 
1 claims are usually easier to prove, see Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. 
Ed. 2d 628 (1984), the plaintiffs have abandoned their section 1 claims."
1043,15," Following a Department of Justice lawsuit and a consent decree, First Multiple is now an open service."
1043,16," The district court, however, applied an erroneous summary judgment standard. The district court granted summary judgment 
on the basis that the ""plaintiffs have produced no evidence that the defendants specifically intended to . . . monopolize [the 
multilist market.]"" The district court however made no specific finding that the defendants first came forward with any evidence 
suggesting that summary judgment was warranted. As we recently held, HN18[
] ""the moving party bears the initial burden to 
show the district court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided 
at trial. Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a 
material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment."" Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). The 
district court did not examine whether the moving party had any evidence on the issue of whether Metro had the requisite intent 
to monopolize. The district court simply, and incorrectly, put the plaintiffs to their burdens of proof. "
1044,," Rather than return this case to the district court and waste precious judicial resources, we have consulted the briefs and 
reviewed the record de novo, and we find that while the district court utilized the wrong procedure it arrived at the right result. "
1047,1," The complaint also contained state-law antitrust claims as well as state tort claims. Although the court granted Antelope's 
motion for summary judgment on these claims, Lancaster's appeal only concerns the federal antitrust claims."
1047,2," Antelope is owned and operated by the District. The District is a not-for-profit hospital district organized under California's Local 
Hospital District Law, Cal. Health & Safety Code § 32000. Although the district court's initial grant of summary judgment was 
directed in favor of Antelope, the court in a later order specified that ""in its previous order, the Court found that the District was "
1048,," clothed with immunity from plaintiff's antitrust claims under the state action doctrine."" (ER at 146) None of the parties on appeal 
contends that a meaningful distinction between Antelope and the District can be made for purposes of state action immunity."
1048,3," The district court refused to grant the Group's motion for summary judgment, concluding that since the Group is a private entity 
the test announced in Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83, 108 S. Ct. 1658 (1988), would have to apply for the 
Group to qualify for state action immunity. The court was unprepared to state at the time of the motion whether the Group would 
qualify for such immunity. This ruling is not before us on appeal."
1048,4," We often say that this issue requires a two-step analysis: First, whether the activity complained of is authorized; second, 
whether the state intends to displace competition with regulation. See, e.g., Traweek v. San Francisco, 920 F.2d 589, 591-92 
(9th Cir. 1990); Boone v. Redevelopment Agency, 841 F.2d 886, 890 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 488 U.S. 965, 102 L. Ed. 2d 526, 
109 S. Ct. 489 (1988). In this case there is no question but that defendants were authorized to enter into contracts. We thus turn 
to the question whether the state has displaced competition with regulation."
1048,5," Since we find that Antelope and District are not authorized to act anti-competitively, we need not go on to decide whether 
Lancaster's competitors have such influence over Antelope and District that active state supervision is required to validate their 
anti-competitive conduct under Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83, 108 S. Ct. 1658 (1988). "
1049,6," The entire thrust of Town of Hallie is to caution against parsing state statutes in an attempt to find a specific authorization for a 
particular activity, since ""no legislature can be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects of a statute. . . ."" 471 U.S. at 43. It 
is in this light that the Court's caution against too close an ""examination of a state legislature's intent"" must be read.  Id. at 44. 
Clearly the Court did not mean to foreclose such examination as is necessary to understand the state's delegation in light of the 
state's general policy. "
1050,7," Contrary to Antelope's contentions, Traweek is wholly consistent with our approach in the instant case. The Traweek court 
considered the statutes that were relevant to the case before it, and concluded that the state had displaced competition with 
regulation. Traweek, 920 F.2d at 593. Although we too focus on the question of whether the state's policy is to suppress or 
support competition, we deal with different statutes here."
1050,8," Perhaps a better explanation of why electric utilities, water works, and cable television are generally highly regulated is that 
these industries are paradigmatic examples of natural monopolies. The unifying characteristic of natural monopoly industries is the ability of a single firm to provide the most economical 
service to a given area. Within the area reached by the physical facilities of the firm, the introduction of additional suppliers 
requires a wasteful duplication of plant and a significant increase in cost not normally justified by any benefits to users of 
the service. Under such circumstances, monopoly is accepted as the most appropriate industry structure and the industry is 
subjected to regulation as a ""public utility.""  Jones, Government Price Controls and Inflation: A Prognosis Based on the Impact of Controls in the Regulated Industries, 65 
Cornell L. Rev. 303, 304 (1980). See generally, M. Handler, H. Blake, R. Pitofsky & H. Goldschmid, Cases and Materials on 
Trade Regulation App. B (2d ed. 1983)."
1050,9," This ground for distinguishing the instant case from these other cases in no way contradicts Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. 
Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 83 L. Ed. 2d 1016, 105 S. Ct. 1005 (1985). In Garcia the Supreme Court repudiated the unworkable 
distinction between ""integral"" and ""proprietary"" government functions in the context of state sovereign immunity analysis. In the 
instant case we do not attempt to revive this discredited approach for use in the field of state-action immunity. Rather, we explain 
the different approaches that this court has taken when attempting to divine a state's view towards competition. This court, in 
considering whether a state has intended to displace competition with regulation, seems to have considered whether competition 
is generally thought to be a viable alternative to regulation in the relevant sphere of economic activity. In cases involving 
paradigmatic natural monopolies, we have more readily found that the legislature has intended to displace competition with 
regulation. "
1051,10," The answer is a resounding ""no."" See Traweek, 920 F.2d at 592-93 (city does not lose antitrust exemption because it 
exercised zoning authority maliciously); Boone v. Redevelopment Agency of San Jose, 841 F.2d 886, 890 (9th Cir.), cert. 
denied 488 U.S. 965, 102 L. Ed. 2d 526, 109 S. Ct. 489 (1988) (redevelopment agency with power to zone, rezone, and grant 
exceptions from building regulations does not lose antitrust immunity because it may have exercised its regulatory power 
corruptly); Llewellyn v. Crothers, 765 F.2d 769 (9th Cir. 1985) (directors of state agency authorized to set rates do not lose state-
action exemption if they act corruptly)."
1051,11," Local hospital districts have been granted the powers needed to engage in the hospital business by the state of California. A 
hospital district's board of directors shall be responsible for the operation of all hospitals owned or leased by the district, according to the best interests of the

1052,12," California has passed a number of amendments to the local hospital district law over the years, and these amendments 
contemplate that the districts operate in a competitive environment. These amendments 1) allow hospital districts to transfer 
assets to private nonprofit corporations (§ 32121 (p) (West Supp. 1989)) and 2) exempt from disclosure to the public ""records of 
a local hospital district . . . which relate to any contract with an insurer or nonprofit hospital service plan for inpatient or outpatient 
services or alternative rates"" for one year after execution of the contract. Cal. Gov't Code § 6254(t) (West Supp. 1987). Moreover, California has affirmatively acted to deregulate hospital and other health care services. These provisions 1) permit 
public and private third party payors to contract for inpatient hospital services (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 14081); 2) do away with 
older legislation requiring health care providers to obtain certificates of need to construct or add to health care facilities (Cal. 
Health & Safety Code § 439.7 (West Supp. 1989); and 3) permit ""California purchasers, providers, and payors to form efficient-
sized bargaining units for the purpose of contracting for the delivery of health care services."" (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16770 (b) 
(West Supp. 1989))."
1052,13," A third type of case may arise. A state's general policy may be to promote competition, but the state might nevertheless 
authorize a particular anti-competitive activity. We are not faced with such a case at present. Nevertheless, we speak of it to 
emphasize the narrowness of our holding. Since the question in all cases under Town of Hallie turns on the state's policy, it 
seems clear that a particular authorization to act in an anti-competitive manner makes the state action exemption applicable. 
Further, it should not ordinarily take a great many such specific authorizations to show that the state's policy is to displace 
competition with regulation."
1052,14," We note that there is no support for defendants' assertion that Lancaster cannot be awarded attorney's fees if Lancaster's 
antitrust action for injunctive relief is successful. Defendants cite in support of their position the Local Government Antitrust Act 
of 1984 (""LGAA""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36. The LGAA precludes the recovery of damages, costs, or attorneys fees, on the basis of 
15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 15a, or 15c, from local government entities. 15 U.S.C. § 35(a). However, the provision that mandates that costs 
and attorneys fees be awarded to plaintiffs who ""substantially prevail"" in actions for injunctive relief is 15 U.S.C. § 26. Section 
35(a), by its clear terms, has no effect on § 26. See also Palm Springs Medical Clinic, Inc. v. Desert Hospital, 628 F. Supp. 454 
(C.D. Cal. 1986). "
1054,15," McNally has now been superseded by statute. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 1346 (1990). However McNally continues to provide the rule 
of decision for conduct that occurred prior to the statute's enactment on November 18, 1988. See United States v. Soriano, 880 
F.2d 192 (9th Cir. 1989); United States v. Kato, 878 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1989). Congress, of course, cannot criminalize conduct 
that has already occurred, U.S. Const., Art. I § 9 cl. 3, and mail fraud is a criminal offense."
1054,16," Subsequently, in Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275, 108 S. Ct. 316 (1987) the Supreme Court held 
that § 1341 encompasses intangible property rights. Carpenter involved the Wall Street Journal's right to the exclusive 
prepublication use of its ""heard on the street"" columns. The Court noted that newsmatter ""'is stock in trade . . . to be distributed 
and sold to those who will pay money for it, as for any other merchandise.'"" 484 U.S. at 26 (quoting International News Service 
v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 236, 63 L. Ed. 211, 39 S. Ct. 68 (1918)). "

Accordingly, we construe Utah's Antitrust Act as applying the same standards and as forbidding the same actions as the 
Sherman Act. "
1059,2," ""Realtor"" is a federally registered collective membership mark. Brief of Appellees at 4 n.5."
1059,3," During plaintiff's deposition, she indicated that Penton took credit for the cancellation of Mountain View Title's advertisement. 
See Addendum to Brief of Appellant, Ex. 9 at 280. This version of accounts is corroborated by Penton's own deposition. See id., 
Ex. 8 at 65 (""I told her that I was the one that got him to drop the ad.""). In plaintiff's affidavit, however, she states that Penton 
said, ""My broker and I"" caused the cancellation. Id., Ex. 3 at 4. In her brief on appeal, plaintiff reverts back to her original version 
and states that ""The vice-president-elect of the OBR . . . , Penton, told Searl he had caused FSBO advertiser Mt. View Title to 
cancel its advertising contract . . . ."" Brief of Appellant at 27 (emphasis added). Finally, in her reply brief, plaintiff repeatedly 
states that Penton got Mountain View Title to cancel the advertisement. Reply Brief of Appellant at 3, 12-13, 21-23, 25. Because 
the confusion on this issue was created by plaintiff, and because she repeatedly argues in her briefs before this court that "
1060,," Penton alone caused the cancellation of the advertisement, we have assumed that Penton, and not his broker, is alleged to have 
caused the cancellation of the Mountain View contract. "
1064,1," Count 1 alleges violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Count 2 alleges violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and 
Count 3 alleges violation of the Cartwright Act. "
1065,2," The ""target area"" approach adopted by Judge Lucas has since been rejected by the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit. (See 
discussion following this footnote). This rejection was based on the intention to narrow the standing rules for antitrust violations, 
not expand them. Dick Geothermal, 890 F.2d at 146. Thus the determination that Jacobson was not a producer or manufacturer 
and therefore lacked. standing retains some persuasiveness."
1065,3," As the Court finds that Jacobson does not have standing as a potential manufacturer, it does not address the issue of the 
statute of limitations bar to this action which is also apparent. "
1066,4," Plaintiff contends that the Ninth Circuit's decision in Helix Milling Co. v. Terminal Flour Mills Co., 523 F.2d 1317 (9th Cir. 1975), 
cert den., 423 U.S. 1053, 96 S.Ct. 782 (1976) (""Helix""), mandates a different result. Helix is distinguishable. Helix Milling 
Company was a competitor in the flour market whose mill was destroyed by fire. Helix alleged that its only way of continuing in 
the milling and sales business was to acquire the assets of an existing mill. Terminal Flour Mills Company bought the mill Helix 
had attempted to obtain. Helix then brought an antitrust claim to enjoin Terminal's acquisition of the mill. Helix varies in significant respects from the instant action. Helix was an existing competitor in the market, temporarily prevented 
from competing, seeking reentry into the market. Helix had made an actual offer to acquire the mill and it appeared to have the 
financial capacity to purchase the mill. As shown above, there are questions as to Mr. Jacobson's preparedness to enter the 
personal watercraft market, and his ability and intent to do so. As noted previously, Mr. Jacobson proffered no evidence of any 
contracts to build engines, evidence of seeking to buy and outfit his own factory, nor any evidence of the ability to do so finance 
production of personal watercraft. "
1067,5," This argument is in line with that articulated by Judge Posner in Grip-Pak, 694 F.2d at 474. There Judge Posner reasoned that 
the tort doctrine preventing actions by parties remote to the actual damages applies to the tort created by the antitrust laws. He 
stated, ""the patent license case is an even stronger illustration of the reasons behind the doctrine of remoteness of damage. The patent 
licensor may have suffered no net diminution in his royalties at all. The contraction in the business of the licensee who was the 
target of an anticompetitive scheme may have led to an expansion in the business other licensees and hence to an increase in 
the royalties paid by them to the licensor that offset the decrease in the royalties paid by the first licensee. And if the licensor 
were allowed to sue, why not everyone else whose fortunes are linked to the victimized licensee--or, if not, everyone, at least he 
licensee's employees, his (other) suppliers, and the merchants who sell to his employees? None of these is more remote from 
the antitrust violation than the licensor."" "
1068,6," The plaintiff heavily relies on the reasoning of Judge Posner in Grip-Pak, 694 F.2d 466. In Grip-Pak Judge Posner admitted in 
dicta that a patent licensor may be too remote from the manipulation of the market to have standing, but held that it does not "
1069,," follow that a patent licensor may never have standing. As Judge Posner stated, it is not her status as a licensor but her 
relationship to the violation that must determine her right to bring a cause of action. If she is the defendant's target she is the one 
suffering from the restraint of the market and thus must be allowed to bring the cause of action. Furthermore, Judge Posner 
stated, if the licensor could not bring the antitrust action, the anticompetitive behavior may go undeterred by the threat of other a 
private cause of action. This argument has some application to the action. Mr. Jacobson has alleged that he is the intended 
target of the defendants' anticompetitive acts. Nonetheless, this analysis, for the reasons previously stated, is not determinative. Finally, the Seventh Circuit in Grip-Pak, merely remanded the action so that the district court could make findings as to whether 
the plaintiff/licensor had standing to bring an antitrust action. The district court determined that the plaintiff did not have standing 
as it was not prepared to enter the market as a potential competitor. Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 651 F.Supp. 1482 
(N.D. Ill. 1986) (the district court applied the factors outlined by the Ninth Circuit in and found that the plaintiff had not taken 
substantial, demonstrable steps to enter the relevant market). "

1084,2," The Supreme Court again summarily affirmed this Court's subsequent approval of the AT & T Plan of Reorganization which 
was drafted under the auspices of the decree. United States v. Western Electric Co., 569 F. Supp. 1057 (D.D.C. 1983), aff'd,

1084,3," From the very outset, this Court has eschewed alphabetical abbreviations which might be incomprehensible to those not 
directly involved in this litigation, and accordingly it has used the term Regional Companies rather than RBOCs, it has made 
reference to the decree rather than the MFJ, and the like. The Court will continue to avoid bureaucratic and technical 
terminology to the extent that it is possible to do so. "
1085,4," ""After completion of the reorganization . . . no BOC shall . . . provide interexchange or information services . . . ."" Section

modification of any of the provisions hereof, for the enforcement of compliance herewith, and for the punishment of any 
violation hereof."

1086,552," F. Supp. at 231. This section was drafted by the Court and its adoption as part of the decree was made a condition of the 
Court's approval. See 552 F. Supp. at 225."

denials and delays in service, poor quality service, and delays in necessary repairs as ""a familiar litany."" Id. at para. 22. If 
Hausman is suggesting that, because these concerns are familiar they have no basis in reality, his reaction is like that of the 
French police inspector in the motion picture Casablanca who was ""shocked -- shocked"" when he was told that gambling was 
going on in Humphrey Bogart's cafe. The litany may be familiar, but the facts behind it are nonetheless real. These facts were 
proved during the AT & T trial by many witnesses in testimony consuming many weeks. With respect to their control over the 
local exchange, the Regional Companies are of course now largely positioned as was AT & T before 1984. "
1088,18," Carlton and Stigler Affidavit at para. 40 (Exhibit 4 to Regional Companies Reply). Any economic disadvantage due to the loss 
of exchange revenues from independent information providers would of course be more than made up through Regional

1088,19," This is so even though the Court had invited all the parties to structure their submissions in the manner of summary judgment 
motions."
1088,20," The Department did make frequent reference to the report of its consultant Peter Huber which had been before this Court in

1088,21," However, the Department does not agree with these companies with regard to the issue of the relevant market. While 
Professor Hausman on behalf of the Regional Companies posits a broad information market which includes computer 
manufacturers, financial service companies, airlines, retailers, and the like (Hausman Affidavit at 4; Regional Companies Brief at 
28-31), the Department states that ""information services do not comprise a single market; they vary with respect to 
concentration, ease of entry, and dependence on local telephone facilities"" (Brief for Appellant United States at 9-10 (Docket 87-
5388) (filed April 17, 1989))."

will be efficient and innovative in information services. The Department does not acknowledge that there exists at least the 
possibility that the companies will gain profits or market share as a result of other factors, i.e., anticompetitive activities. "

1089,29," It has long been established that HN1[
] essential facilities, that is, facilities which cannot feasibly be duplicated but which 
are critical to competitors, are a type of entry barrier. Whoever controls such an essential facility has the power to exclude 
competition, and such control indicates market or monopoly power. See Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366,

1089,30," For the reasons discussed in the body of this Part of the Opinion, the Court finds as a fact that the ability to exercise market 
power is fully present. The incentive to exercise such power may be deduced from the expectation of increased profits and the 
acquisition by Regional Company managers of the ability to direct increasingly diversified, increasingly powerful conglomerates. 
In fact, since they were established, the companies have made many efforts to enter markets in which their bottleneck 
monopolies give them an advantage over possible competitors. See Part IV, infra. "

prices to deny profits to their competitors. The issues surrounding that circumstance are discussed in Part V, infra.  [**23]"

1092,47," Of course, unless and until they are allowed fully into the information services market, the companies as a general matter lack

1095,57," The Regional Companies are almost never penalized for engaging in anticompetitive behavior even if ultimately they lose 
before the regulators. See Affidavit of Nina Cornell at 30 (Exhibit 2 to MCI Opposition). In voice messaging, for example, 
BellSouth delayed making available to its competitors a special feature until it was ready to compete in the market. Id. at 14-15. 
BellSouth also provided a call forwarding feature to its competitors under a tariff which raised these competitors' costs by as 
much as 900%. Cornell Affidavit at 12. The company withdrew the tariff from operation in Florida, but that same tariff is still in 
effect in other states. Id. at 12."
1095,58," To be sure, unlike its most recent predecessors, the current Federal Communications Commission does not appear to be 
viscerally opposed to the very regulation it is charged with administering. However, the problems with regulation in the 
telecommunications market are primarily the systemic ones described above; they do not depend, except at the margin, on the 
abilities and good intentions of the regulators. In the 1960s and 1970s, the FCC appears to have been committed to making 
regulation work, but as the AT & T trial record shows, the Commission was incapable of neutralizing the Bell System's 
anticompetitive activities."
1095,59," If the Department's belief in the Regional Companies' good intentions is intended to extend also to the record of the 
companies when they were still a part of the Bell System, it is of course contradicted by almost every paper the Department filed

1099,84," The Department of Justice professes not to know whether cost shifting opportunities will raise or lower prices in an information 
services market. Department Reply Brief at 64. But it is perfectly obvious that, while such strategies will in the short run lower 
price -- as, for example, also does ""dumping"" by foreign firms -- in the long run they permit the extraction of much higher prices 
and profits following the elimination of competitors from the market."

1100,88," Some factors have been determined by the Court of Appeals as being plainly without that rubric (e.g., the welfare of local 
ratepayers) and others are clearly appropriate antitrust considerations (e.g., the power to raise price). With respect to still other 
subjects (e.g., provision of better services and other benefits to the public) the answer is not certain."
1100,89, Regional Companies Reply Brief at 2.
1100,90," After the independents have been eliminated from the market, the American consumer is likely to be faced with sharply 
reduced choices in information services: the Regional Companies will have no incentive to inaugurate new or innovative services 
(just as their predecessor AT & T had no incentive to provide and was slow in providing new services and products when it had 
monopoly control over the local exchanges and was thereby enabled to keep out competitors in long distance and 
manufacturing). This problem will in the present instance be exacerbated by the fact that because information services are 
expensive to develop and relatively cheap to disseminate, the Regional Companies will have little incentive to develop new 
services once competitors have been forced out of the market. Noll Affidavit at 14. "
1101,91," Some of the Regional Companies have been quite ready since the beginning of the decree construction and waiver process to 
make claims that were repudiated as soon as they had served their purposes. For example, in response to this Court's September 10, 1987 opinion on information services, the assertion was made that all 
the companies needed in order to facilitate the provision to the American people of the most advanced information services was 
a relaxation of the restriction on the transmission of such services. See, e.g., Proposed Order and Explanatory Memorandum of 
U S West filed October 15, 1987. However, immediately upon the achievement of that goal, a drumbeat of arguments was heard 
that there was also an absolute necessity for the companies' entry into information content. The claim was made and endlessly 
repeated that, unless they were also permitted to generate information, they had not received all that was their due, and the 
American public was being shortchanged with respect to information services. The prediction made now that the entry of the 
Regional Companies into information services will yield vast benefits to the American public must be evaluated in the light of that 
experience and others of a similar nature."

1102,95," In addition to its legal duty to follow that course, this judge is also mindful of the several district judges in various Southern 
states who, in the years following Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954), and other 
Supreme Court and Court of Appeals rulings on civil rights issues, stubbornly refused to follow these rulings. These were entirely 
inappropriate courses of action, and this judge has no desire to emulate them."
1102,96," Regional Companies Reply at 1. The same theme is repeated again and again. See, e.g., Reply Brief at 3 (""In light of the 
complex, multi-factored, judgmental character of the Department's policy determination, and the impressive array of support that 
determination has received, no one could reasonably conclude that removal of the information services restriction is 'certain to 
lessen competition,'""). "

1103,100, 900 F.2d at 295.
1103,101," The Court of Appeals stated in this connection that District Courts were to decide only whether the settlement is within the 
reaches of the public interest. 900 F.2d at 309."
1103,102," In this respect, the Court of Appeals relied in part upon the assumption that this Court required the Department to report to 
the Court every three years concerning the need for the restriction. 900 F.2d at 297. That assumption is mistaken. The 
Department of Justice volunteered to provide such reports; they were never required. 552 F. Supp. at 195."
1103,103," Elsewhere, the Court of Appeals again emphasized that on the issue of the efficacy of the FCC regulations the Department of 
Justice's assessment is entitled to significant weight, and it went on to affirm various conclusions reached by this Court on the 
basis that the Department agreed with this Court and there was no reason to doubt the assessments made thereon by the 
Department of Justice. 900 F.2d at 309. Similarly in postponing judgment on the efficacy of FCC regulations, the Court of 
Appeals said that it thought it ""more prudent to await the DOJ's assessment in subsequent Triennial Reviews."" 900 F.2d at 298 
(emphasis added)."
1103,104," The Court of Appeals further relied on the conclusion that it was an ""institutional anomaly"" for a District Court to evaluate the 
effectiveness of an agency's regulatory program, but that there was no such anomaly when the Department of Justice conducts 
such an evaluation. 900 F.2d at 298. Courts pass on and otherwise evaluate federal agency programs in a great variety of 
situations; indeed a substantial proportion of the docket of the Court of Appeals consists of such cases, and they likewise appear "
1104,," with some frequency in the district courts, both here and elsewhere. However, such an evaluation by another Executive 
department in the course of litigation, particularly litigation concerning a judicial decree, is unusual."
1104,105," While a party to litigation may not infrequently be more familiar with the intricacies of particular facts and law than a court, it 
has never been suggested that this circumstance requires a court to give deference to the conclusions reached by such a party. 
Even where an agency is charged with the administration of a particular statute, its interpretations and litigating positions are not 
entitled to judicial deference if such positions, as here, are ""unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice,"" 
Georgetown University Hospital v. Sullivan, 934 F.2d 1280, 1283 n. 3 (D.C. Cir., 1991). Here, of course, we are dealing with the 
interpretation of a judicial decree -- not a subject under Department of Justice administration. Moreover, while that Department 
may have greater expertise than the courts on antitrust matters in general, this is not likely to be true of the law and the facts 
governing this particular case which has been under the Court's continuous jurisdiction for over a decade."

1104,110," Motion at 15, 30. On the other hand, the Department has concluded that the risk of anticompetitive discrimination against 
information service providers is not substantial, because these providers could reach their customers through various types of 
indirect connections -- a conclusion that seems to be at odds with one noted in note 109, supra."

1105,115," As the Court has previously noted, when the decree was drafted, adopted, and implemented, and for several years thereafter, 
the Department expressed and urged upon the Court views that were precisely the opposite of its current stance on virtually 
every issue. Nothing occurred at the time of the Department's change in position other than a change in personnel."
1105,116," In fact, the Court of Appeals itself speaks of ""anticompetitive risks associated with lifting the restriction,"" 900 F.2d at 309 n. 29 
(emphasis added), a concept that would appear to be antagonistic to the certainty standard. Moreover, although the burden of persuasion is normally on the proponent of a motion, and that proponent must make his case 
by a preponderance of the evidence, the appellate mandate places the burden on those opposing the Regional Company 
motion, and requires them to prove their position by a standard that exceeds even the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard 
applicable to criminal cases."
1105,117," While Brown Shoe involved section 7 of the Clayton Act, the Regional Companies themselves have stressed that contains a 
""closely analogous standard."" Joint Brief for Regional Company Appellants at 54 (filed April 17, 1989), No. 87-5388 (D.C. Cir. 
1990). See also, II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 304a (1990)."
1105,118," See also, the reference in the Regional Companies' Reply Brief to the ""field of economic prediction and inexact science,"" 
quoted at p. 329 supra. Even the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Federal Reserve Board, and individuals and organizations that invest in 
the stock market have frequently discovered to their dismay that they are wrong: whatever they may hope for, they surely cannot 
be certain. "
1106,119," Similarly, the appellate court contrasted removals under Section VII of the decree (which, it said, deals with public interest 
""today"") with Section VIII(C) (which concern the question whether the ability to impede competition had changed from the time 
""when the decree was approved""). 900 F.2d at 307."
1106,120," The Court of Appeals said that there was ""no record to speak of"" in the AT & T trial regarding information services, and from 
this premise it concluded that this Court lacked a factual basis in 1982 for the imposition of the information services restriction 
(absent the parties' agreement). 900 F.2d at 307. However, this Court noted when it approved that restriction at the Department 
of Justice's request that this restriction ""is necessary for reasons similar to those justifying the restriction on interexchange 
services . . . ."" 552 F. Supp. at 189. And there can be no question but that (1) insofar as the potential for anticompetitive conduct 
is concerned, the two types of services parallel each other, and (2) there was ample evidence of such conduct with respect to 
the interexchange market."
1106,121," Although a decision today regarding the removal of the information services restriction must be made on the basis of present 
conditions, it is difficult to do so while ignoring what occurred when the local telephone operating companies last had the 
opportunity to act in a discriminatory fashion on a significant scale because their bottlenecks on local exchange service gave 
them an unfair advantage. One way to take account of these events so as to bring them up to date is to inquire whether any 
material change occurred between then and now."
1106,122, Justice Department Reply Brief at 3-4.
1106,123," The Court of Appeals recognized that problem, stating that ""it may be difficult to decide whether the BOCs would have 
[market] power if they were allowed to enter a market."" 900 F.2d at 296."
1106,124," It is somewhat ironic that the Department of Justice complains that its opponents are relying ""on economic theory alone,"" and 
that it counsels against the use of ""economic theory divorced from the facts."" Reply Brief at 15. The truth is that it is the 
Department that wishes to escape from concrete facts -- those that emerged during the AT & T trial and in the Tunney Act 
proceeding -- and to rely instead primarily on predictions."
1106,125," The Department's judgments would obviously have less weight in the context of tangible evidence such as that of Regional 
Company anticompetitive conduct prior to 1982. "
1107,126," The Court has rejected the alternative of construing the appellate opinion in such a way as to permit it to order the retention of 
the restriction. See, e.g., Part VIII, infra. The Court feels obligated to interpret the opinion of the Court of Appeals as that tribunal 
most plausibly intended it to be interpreted."
1107,127," Said the court, ""because we cannot be certain that these findings were not infected by the court's legal error. . . ."" 900 F.2d at 
308 (emphasis added). On the other hand, elsewhere the appellate court's discussion of the certainty concept appears to have 
broader scope than a reference to appellate duties (""the appropriate question under section VII is whether the proposed 
modification would be certain to lessen competition,"" 900 F.2d at 308). See also, United States v. Western Electric Co., 285 U.S. 
App. D.C. 199, 907 F.2d 1205, 1209 n. 7 (D.C. Cir. 1990)."

1114,1," Section 13(b) of the FTCA provides, in pertinent part: HN1[
] Whenever the [FTC] has reason to believe -- (1) that any person, partnership, or corporation is violating, or is about to violate, any provision of law enforced by the 
[FTC], and (2) that the enjoining thereof pending the issuance of a complaint by the [FTC] and until such complaint is dismissed by the 
[FTC] or set aside by the court on review, or until the order of the [FTC] made thereon has become final, would be in the 
interest of the public -- the [FTC] . . . may bring suit in a district court of the United States to enjoin any such act or practice. Upon a proper showing 
that, weighing the equities and considering the [FTC]'s likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest, 
and after notice to the defendant, a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction may be granted without bond. . . ."
1114,2," Section 7 of the Clayton Act provides, in pertinent part: HN2[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or 
any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the [FTC] shall acquire the whole or any 
part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce, where in any line of 
commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially 
to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. "
1115,3," UHI is a nonprofit Georgia corporation based in Augusta, Georgia. UHI is the parent company of UHS and UHR: UHS operates 
University Hospital; UHR is a for-profit corporation owned by UHS."
1115,4," HCC owns St. Joseph through a holding company, St. Joseph Center for Life, Inc. (Center for Life). HCC, St. Joseph, and 
Center for Life are all appellees."
1115,5," In addition, UHI would acquire 50% interests in a retirement community and a social services agency from St. Joseph and the 
Center for Life (UHS already owns the other half-interests). St. Joseph Ventures, Inc., a for-profit subsidiary of Center for Life, 
would also transfer to UHR its 5% interest in a medical office building under construction on the St. Joseph campus, various 
medical office leases, and contracts to provide pharmaceuticals valued at less than $ 10,000."
1115,6, Center for Life owns the other 50%.
1115,7, HCC and Center for Life would retain the home care and hospice operations of St. Joseph.
1115,8," The FTC also moved for a temporary restraining order, to prevent University from acquiring St. Joseph's assets before the 
district court could decide whether to issue the preliminary injunction. The court did not issue the temporary restraining order, 
however, because the appellees agreed not to consummate the transaction until after the court ruled on the FTC's motion for an 
injunction."
1115,9," Prior to this hearing, the appellees moved to dismiss this action on the ground that the FTC lacked jurisdiction to challenge 
asset acquisitions by nonprofit hospitals, like University Hospital, under section 7 of the Clayton Act. The court denied the 
motion. For a discussion of this issue, see infra part II."
1115,10," The district court, on April 4, entered, from the bench, findings of fact and conclusions of law, denying the FTC's request for a 
preliminary injunction. The facts presented in our opinion are based on this oral order, as well as the court's supplemental written 
order, entered on April 11, 1991, in which the court summarized the reasons for its April 4 ruling. When necessary, however, we 
augment the district court's findings with uncontested facts that the parties established at the hearing. "
1116,11," The court noted, in both its initial oral order and its supplemental written order, that University Hospital and St. Joseph do not 
compete in every acute-care service. Rather, there are approximately 19 major diagnostic categories in which these hospitals 
compete. It does not appear that the district court intended to limit its market definition solely to these 19 categories. 
Furthermore, as the FTC points out in its brief to us, such a redefinition of the relevant product market would be of no moment 
for our purposes; it would only strengthen the FTC's case by, in effect, overvaluing St. Joseph's strength. For ease of discussion, 
we will treat the provision of acute-care services in general as the relevant product market."
1116,12," The most prominent method of measuring market concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI). The Justice 
Department and the FTC rely on the HHI in evaluating proposed horizontal mergers (such as the asset acquisition in this case). 
See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Merger Guidelines §§ 3.1, 3.11(c), 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) para. 13,103, at 20,560-61 (1988) 
[hereinafter Merger Guidelines]. The HHI is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of every firm in the relevant 
market. For example, in a market with six firms with market shares of 25%, 20%, 20%, 15%, 10%, and 10%, the HHI is 1850 
(25<2> + 20<2> + 20<2> + 15<2> + 10<2> + 10<2> = 1850). Under this test, a market in which the premerger HHI is above 
1800 is considered ""highly concentrated,"" and a merger in such a market, which increases the HHI by over 50, raises significant 
antitrust concerns because it presents a substantial opportunity for anticompetitive collusion. Furthermore, any merger that 
increases a market's HHI by over 100, to a post-merger level over 1000, raises antitrust concerns. In the present case, the 
proposed merger would increase the HHI by over 630 to approximately 3200. Another method used to evaluate market concentration is the four-firm concentration ratio (CR4), which sums the market shares 
of the four largest firms in the relevant market. (Some economists prefer an eight-firm concentration ratio.) The Department of 
Justice used the CR4 prior to 1982, when it replaced it with the HHI. (The HHI, unlike the CR4 or CR8, reflects a higher market 
concentration as the disparity in the size of firms increases and as the number of firms outside the largest four or eight 
decreases.) Generally, a market with a CR4 greater than 75 is conducive to collusion and, hence, mergers in such markets 
deserve careful scrutiny. In this case, the post-merger CR4 would equal 100 since only four hospitals would exist. "
1117,13," The appellees make two additional arguments, which we dispose of here. First, they argue that the acquisition in question is 
immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state-action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 
(1943), and its progeny. See Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985). The 
appellees claim that Georgia's certificate of need law, which regulates the creation of new hospitals and the expansion of 
existing hospitals based on the health-care needs of local communities, evinces a state policy favoring the displacement of 
unfettered competition among hospitals for health-care services. According to them, the clearly foreseeable result of this state 
law is the suppression of all competition in the hospital industry. Furthermore, since the state's policy is exercised by local 
governmental authorities, here the Richmond County Hospital Authority, which has delegated its power to University, active 
supervision by the state is not required. Cf.  id. at 47, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. Alternatively, if active supervision is required, see 
California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 943, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980), 
the appellees argue that the existence of judicial review is sufficient to establish state supervision. (In support of their alternative 
argument, the appellees cite our vacated opinion in Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Medical Center, 851 F.2d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.), 
vacated, reh'g granted, 861 F.2d 1233 (11th Cir. 1988) (en banc), reinstated, in part, 874 F.2d 755 (11th Cir. 1989) (en banc), 
vacated and rev'd., 891 F.2d 810 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 924, 110 S. Ct. 1960, 109 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1990), despite our "
1118,," clear direction that the state-action discussion in that opinion ""remains vacated and without precedential value,"" Bolt, 874 F.2d at 
756 (emphasis added).) In our judgment, this argument is meritless. Georgia has not clearly articulated a policy to displace all competition by hospitals. 
HN3[
] Georgia's certificate of need statute specifically exempts most acquisitions by existing hospitals, including the 
acquisition here, from prior regulatory approval. Ga. Code. Ann. § 31-6-47 (Supp. 1990). While the appellees conclude that this 
exemption ""can only be the result of a legislative determination that exempt transactions are consistent with the general . . . 
purpose [of the certificate of need statute],"" it is at least equally plausible, if not more so, that Georgia intended that the 
transactions exempt from its regulatory review be subject to antitrust scrutiny. Cf.  National Gerimedical Hosp. & Gerontology 
Center v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 389, 101 S. Ct. 2415, 2422, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1981) (""Even when an industry is regulated 
substantially, this does not necessarily evidence an intent to repeal the antitrust laws with respect to every action taken within 
the industry. . . . Intent to repeal the antitrust laws is much clearer when a regulatory agency has been empowered to authorize 
or require the type of conduct under antitrust challenge.""). Thus, we cannot conclude that Georgia's policy clearly favors asset 
acquisitions by hospitals regardless of their competitive effects. Accordingly, the appellees' acquisition is not entitled to immunity 
from the antitrust laws. Second, the appellees argue that since the consumers in the relevant market are largely sophisticated insurers with significant 
bargaining power, rather than individuals, it is unlikely that the hospitals that remain in the market after the acquisition is 
consummated would be able to lessen competition. We agree that ""concentration on the buying side of a market does inhibit 
collusion."" Hospital Corp. of Am. v. FTC, 807 F.2d 1381, 1391 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1038, 107 S. Ct. 1975, 95 
L. Ed. 2d 815 (1987). The insurance companies in this market, however, are not truly large buyers; rather, they are third-party 
payors acting on behalf of individuals, the ultimate consumers. These insurance companies, as a practical matter, could not 
refuse to reimburse their subscribers because the prices in the relevant market were too high; rather, they would, as always, 
reimburse their subscribers for necessary medical services and, if the prices remained high, they would pass these increased 
costs on to the individual consumers. Thus, if the hospitals in the relevant market tacitly colluded, so as not to alert these 
insurers of their anticompetitive plan, their behavior would likely go unchecked. Id. Moreover, given the FTC's strong showing 
that the proposed acquisition is likely to lessen competition substantially, see infra [Slip Op.] pp. 18-19, we think that the 
existence of these sophisticated purchasers in the relevant market, which may inhibit collusion, is insufficient to overcome the 
FTC's case."
1118,14," Section 7 also applies to stock or share capital acquisitions. See supra note 2. Many nonprofit entities, like St. Joseph's 
Hospital, however, have no stock or share capital to acquire. This part of section 7, then, is inapplicable to many acquisitions of 
nonprofit enterprises, such as the one at issue here. See United States v. Rockford Memorial Corp., 898 F.2d 1278, 1280 (7th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920, 111 S. Ct. 295, 112 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1990). But see United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 
U.S. 321, 335-49, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 1726-34, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963) (merger between banks is subject to stock-acquisition 
clause of section 7, even though in corporate law such merger is asset acquisition). Of course, if a nonprofit corporation acquired 
the stock or share capital of another entity, this transaction would fall within section 7's ambit. "
1119,15," Section 1 of the Clayton Act defines ""persons"" as all corporations, including nonprofit corporations. See National Collegiate 
Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100 n.22, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 2960 n.22, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984)."
1119,16, The remainder of section 11 prescribes the procedures these agencies must use in enforcing the Clayton Act.
1119,17," Section 7 provides limited exceptions for certain transactions, including those ""duly consummated pursuant to the authority 
given by the Secretary of Transportation, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Power Commission, Interstate 
Commerce Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission . . ., the United States Maritime Commission, or the 
Secretary of Agriculture. . . . "" "
1120,18," The loophole the Court spoke of referred to the absence of the asset-acquisition provision in the original version of the Clayton 
Act. As originally enacted, section 7 only applied to stock acquisitions. To avoid the constraints of section 7, corporations used 
asset acquisitions to achieve the same result as stock acquisitions. The Court ""uncovered"" this loophole when it held that the 
Clayton Act did not apply to such transactions. See Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Elec. Co. v. FTC, 291 U.S. 587, 54 S. Ct. 532, 78 L. 
Ed. 1007 (1934); FTC v. Western Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554, 47 S. Ct. 175, 71 L. Ed. 405 (1926). In 1950, Congress closed this 
loophole by amending sections 7 and 11 to allow the FTC to prevent asset acquisitions that tend substantially to lessen 
competition."
1120,19," Ten years later, Congress reiterated that the FTC's jurisdiction in enforcing the Clayton Act is defined by reference to section 
11 of that act. In 1960, Congress debated whether to amend section 7 to include asset acquisitions by banks, which were 
understood at that time to be excepted from section 7. The Senate explained the reason for this exception as follows: Acquisitions of assets were included [in 1950] within [section 7 of the Clayton Act], but only in the case of corporations 
subject to the jurisdiction of the [FTC] (banks, being subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Board for purposes of 
the Clayton Act by virtue of section 11 of that act, were not affected). S. Rep. No. 196, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1959) (emphasis added) (final report on Bank Merger Act of 1960). Subsequently, 
Congress, in lieu of amending the Clayton Act, enacted the Bank Merger Act of 1960, 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c) (1988)."
1120,20," Neither Rockford Memorial Corp. nor Carilion Health System has much precedential value on this issue. The discussion in 
Rockford Memorial Corp. is dicta; the government failed to raise and, therefore, waived, the section 11 argument in that case.  
Rockford Memorial Corp., 898 F.2d at 1280-81. In Carilion Health System, the Fourth Circuit, on appeal, declined, in an 
unpublished opinion, to decide whether section 7 of the Clayton Act applies to nonprofit hospitals; it simply affirmed the district 
court on other grounds.  Carilion Health Sys., 892 F.2d 1042, 1989-2 Trade Cas. P. 68,859, at 62,513, 62,516 (4th Cir. Nov. 
29, 1989). "
1121,21," As noted above, section 11 provides that the ""authority to enforce compliance with sections [2, 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act] 
by the persons respectively subject thereto is vested . . . in the [FTC] where applicable to all . . . character of commerce"" not 
regulated by other specified federal agencies.  15 U.S.C. § 21(a) (emphasis added). The appellees argue that the emphasized 
language demonstrates that the jurisdiction of the FTC is defined outside of section 11; thus, they argue, reliance on section 11 
is illogical. We disagree. As the FTC points out, at the time Congress amended section 11, the enumerated sections of the 
Clayton Act applied to different kinds of entities: sections 2 and 3 applied to all entities; section 7 only applied to corporations; 
and section 8 applied to natural persons. Thus, the emphasized language only clarifies that the agencies listed in section 11, 
including the FTC, may only enforce the different sections of the Clayton Act against the entities subject to them; in other words, 
Congress did not intend to expand, through section 11, the kinds of entities subject to sections 2, 3, 7, and 8, respectively."
1121,22," Thus, despite the fact that the Federal Reserve Board had no authority to enforce the Clayton Act against bank mergers, see 
Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 344 n.22, 83 S. Ct. at 1731 n.22, the Court declined to categorize banks as an ""other 
character of commerce,"" thereby subjecting them to the FTC's jurisdiction to enforce the asset-acquisition clause of the Clayton 
Act, id. at 336 n.11, 83 S. Ct. at 1726 n.11. "
1122,23," The appellees also argue that even if the FTC has jurisdiction to enforce section 7 against nonprofit corporations, it cannot 
enjoin this acquisition under section 13(b) of the FTCA. This argument is based, once again, on the fact that the FTC has no 
jurisdiction under the FTCA to regulate nonprofit corporations.  15 U.S.C. § 44. We do not accept this limited reading of section 
13(b). Section 13(b) authorizes the FTC to seek injunctive relief against violations of ""any provision of law enforced by [it]."" To 
exempt the present acquisition, which the FTC may regulate under section 7 of the Clayton Act, from section 13(b) of the FTCA, 
would frustrate Congress' clear intent to provide the FTC with a means of effectively enforcing the laws it administers, FTC v. 
Exxon Corp., 205 U.S. App. D.C. 208, 636 F.2d 1336, 1342-43 (D.C. Cir. 1980); indeed, once an anticompetitive acquisition is 
consummated, it is difficult to ""unscramble the egg."" In our judgment, section 13(b) applies to the FTC's enforcement power 
under all statutes, not just those contained in the FTCA. Accordingly, we hold that the FTC, to ensure compliance with section 7 
of the Clayton Act in this case, properly brought an action for a preliminary injunction under section 13(b) of the FTCA."
1122,24," Significant market concentration makes it ""easier for firms in the market to collude, expressly or tacitly, and thereby force price 
above or farther above the competitive level."" Rockford Memorial Corp., 898 F.2d at 1282-83 (quoting Hospital Corp. of Am., 807 
F.2d at 1386); see also FTC v. PPG Indus., 798 F.2d 1500, 1503 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (""where rivals are few, firms will be able to "
1123,," coordinate their behavior, either by overt collusion or implicit understanding, in order to restrict output and achieve profits above 
competitive levels"")."
1123,25," Conceptually, this shifting of the burdens of production, with the ultimate burden of persuasion remaining always with the 
government, conjures up images of a tennis match, where the government serves up its prima facie case, the defendant returns 
with evidence undermining the government's case, and then the government must respond to win the point. In practice, 
however, the government usually introduces all of its evidence at one time, and the defendant responds in kind. This is 
particularly true when the government seeks a temporary restraining order or, as here, a preliminary injunction and, thus, time is 
of the essence."
1123,26," The threat of outsiders' entry into a market may deter existing competitors from colluding if entry barriers are low. See United 
States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 532-33, 93 S. Ct. 1096, 1100-01, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1973); FTC v. Procter & "
1124,," Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 581, 87 S. Ct. 1224, 1231, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967) (Clorox) (""It is clear that the existence of Procter 
at the edge of the industry exerted considerable influence on the market. . . . [The] industry was influenced by each firm's 
predictions of the market behavior of its competitors, actual and potential.""). In this case, however, there would not even be a 
legitimate threat of entry restraining the hospitals because of the restrictions that Georgia's certificate of need law imposes."
1124,27," Moreover, the FTC introduced evidence showing that the appellees, by their own admissions, intend to eliminate competition 
through the proposed acquisition. For example, the appellees, in a report prepared by a joint University Hospital/St. Joseph task 
force, stated that:"
1124,1," .  Due to reduced usage rates . . . competition will get keener in the Augusta market, even with an increasing population. . . . ."
1124,6," .  In order to be successful, University Hospital feels that an outright merger with St. Joseph Hospital is most desirable. A 
merger would accomplish the following: a.  Reduce competition. Similarly, University's counsel, in a report submitted in support of University's premerger notification, stated: ""The transaction will 
. . . produce substantial welfare-enhancing benefits to consumers. . . . First, there will be a reduction in cost increasing non-price 
competition. . . ."" The district court discounted this language as casual references ""to a reduction in wasteful and unnecessary duplication of 
resources rather than . . . [confessions of an] unlawful tendency toward the creation of monopoly or a substantial lessening of 
competitive factors that would exist in the market place."" We need not decide whether the court's characterization of these 
statements is clearly erroneous because we conclude that even without this evidence, the FTC is entitled to a preliminary 
injunction."
1124,28," The parties agree, as the district court found, that St. Joseph is not a ""failing company,"" and that the appellees are not 
asserting a ""failing company"" defense. HN11[
] Under the ""failing company"" defense, an acquisition that otherwise would "
1125,," violate section 7 is allowed if: (1) the firm being acquired faces a ""grave probability of business failure"" (i.e., bankruptcy) and (2) 
there is no less anticompetitive means of avoiding the failure, such as merger with some other firm. See Citizen Publishing Co. 
v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 136-39, 89 S. Ct. 927, 930-31, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1969); International Shoe Co. v. FTC, 280 U.S. 
291, 302, 50 S. Ct. 89, 93, 74 L. Ed. 431 (1930). "
1126,29," Of course, once it is determined that a merger would substantially lessen competition, expected economies, however great, 
will not insulate the merger from a section 7 challenge. See Clorox, 386 U.S. at 579, 87 S. Ct. at 1231 (""Congress was aware 
[when it enacted section 7] that some mergers which lessen competition may also result in economies but it struck the balance 
in favor of protecting competition.""); Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 371, 83 S. Ct. at 1745-46 (""Congress determined to 
preserve our traditionally competitive economy. It therefore proscribed anticompetitive mergers, the benign and the malignant 
alike, fully aware, we must assume, that some price might have to be paid."")."
1126,30," It is unnecessary for us to define the parameters of this defense now; as we explain infra, the appellees failed to demonstrate 
that the proposed acquisition would generate significant efficiencies. We note, however, that it may further the goals of antitrust 
law to limit the availability of an efficiency defense, even when a defendant can demonstrate that its proposed acquisition would 
produce significant efficiencies. For example, it might be proper to require proof that the efficiencies to be gained by the 
acquisition cannot be secured by means that inflict less damage to competition, such as internal expansion or merger with 
smaller firms. For various suggestions on the proper scope of an efficiency defense, see Murris, supra p. 26, 426-31 (advocating 
absolute efficiency defense); P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra p. 1221, paras. 939-62 (advocating partial defense limited to types of "
1127,," efficiencies); L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 204, at 631 (1977) (advocating partial defense limited only by 
evidentiary standard); Rogers, The Limited Case for an Efficiency Defense in Horizontal Mergers, 58 Tul. L. Rev. 503, 521-25, 
528 (1983) (advocating partial defense for merger between two small firms in market dominated by large firms). Some scholars 
advocate placing the efficiency issue before enforcement agencies rather than courts. See, e.g., Williamson, Economies as an 
Antitrust Defense Revisited, 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 699, 729-31 (1977) (proposing that the Justice Department and the FTC 
consider efficiencies but not the courts). Others have suggested that enforcement agencies simply take efficiencies into account 
by increasing the level of market concentration at which a merger is challenged, rather than engaging in case-by-case weighing 
of efficiencies. Fisher & Lande, supra p. 1222, at 1670-77; R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself 129 (1978); 
R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 112-13 (1976)."
1127,31," The Department of Justice and the FTC, in deciding whether to challenge a merger, require the same threshold showing. See 
Merger Guidelines, supra note 12, § 3.5 para. 13,103, at 20,564."
1127,32," Nor did the appellees compare the benefits they expect to realize from the alleged efficiencies with the costs the intended 
acquisition may exact on competition. It is difficult, then, to conclude with any reliability that the acquisition ultimately would aid, 
rather than hinder, competition and consumers. "
1133,1," Defendant also raises as bases for dismissal a statute of limitations issue and plaintiff's failure to state a claim. Because of our 
disposition of this case, we will not address the above issues."
1133,2," Section 2 provides: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade or 
commerce in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in any section thereof, is hereby declared to be illegal and every person 
who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor."
1133,10, L.P.R.A. § 258.
1133,3," Section 7(a) states: HN2[
] (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different 
purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption or resale in 
Puerto Rico, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce in Puerto Rico, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either 
grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them."
1133,10, L.P.R.A. § 263(a). [**5] 
1134,4," HN4[
] Article 2(c) defines a ""Public service company"" as any public carrier, conduit conveyance enterprise, gas enterprise, electric power enterprise, telecommunications enterprise, 
dry dock enterprise, travel bureau, transportation broker, dock operator, warehouser, toll bridge enterprise, nuclear power 
enterprise, community television antenna enterprise, and moving enterprise and moving enterprise offering to render or 
rendering their services or offering to deliver or delivering products for pay, to the public in general or to a part thereof in 
Puerto Rico. It does not include persons rendering services for their exclusive use or that of their tenants."
1134,27, L.P.R.A. § 1002(c) (1976 and Supp. 1988) (emphasis added). 
1136,5," Were we to have subject matter jurisdiction, the facts of this case might call for application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. In 
the local court action Liquilux argued that the PSC, and not the court, had exclusive jurisdiction. Here, plaintiff presents the 
opposing argument, that both the court and the PSC have jurisdiction over claims by LPG companies. These contradictory 
positions with respect to the same issue, the PSC jurisdiction of LPG companies, argued in different judicial forums, seem to call 
for this estoppel doctrine. ""In broad outline, the doctrine [of judicial estoppel] precludes a party from asserting a position in one legal proceeding which is 
contrary to a position it has already asserted in another."" Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st 
Cir. 1987). In Patriot Cinemas, the court noted that the purpose or goal behind the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the 
judicial system. ""If parties feel free to select contradictory positions before different tribunals to suit their ends, the integrity and 
efficacy of the courts will suffer."" 834 F.2d at 214. However, because of our disposition of the case, we do not reach the issue of whether judicial estoppel would apply to the facts 
of this case. "
1140,1," In addition, Inglis brought two conspiracy claims against Continental; Inglis eventually dropped one and the district court 
awarded summary judgment to Continental on the second. Inglis' original Complaint also named two other defendants, American 
Bakeries Company and Campbell-Taggart Incorporated. At trial, the jury found American not liable. Campbell-Taggart settled the 
Inglis claims as part of a transaction in which Campbell-Taggart purchased Inglis' assets. As a result of its sale to Campbell-
Taggart, Inglis ceased production and withdrew from the bread market.  William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental 
Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1023-24 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61, 103 S. Ct. 57 (1982) 
(hereinafter ""Inglis I"")."
1140,2, See note 1 supra. 
1141,3," To prevail on this claim, Inglis needed to prove, in addition, that Continental engaged in anticompetitive conduct to accomplish 
its unlawful end, and that there was a dangerous probability that Continental would succeed in acquiring a monopoly. See 
Thurman at 1378; Inglis I, 668 F.2d at 1027."
1141,4," We mean ""production costs"" to include expenses for distribution and marketing and any other expenses required to bring the 
bread to market."
1141,5," Inglis and E&W referred to this measure as the ""average variable cost"" of Continental's private label bread."
1141,6," To constitute sufficient evidence of intent, a price/cost comparison must employ a measure of cost that limits includable 
expenses to those that not only are ""uniquely incurred,"" but also ""vary with output"" of the product alleged to have been sold at a 
predatory price. See Inglis I, 668 F.2d at 1037. Step (ii) in Inglis' cost methodology shows that Inglis attempted to meet this 
second requirement. Because the cost computation was otherwise flawed, we do not reach the issue of whether the study 
correctly determined which expenses were variable. "
1142,7," Inglis argues that the district court erred in excluding as inadmissible a report, prepared for Continental by McKinsey & Co., that 
advised Continental to ""maintain prices to hasten wholesaler exit pace."" Inglis argues that the court also erred by redacting 
Continental's own reports to remove references to ""[eliminating competitors]"" and ""gear[ing] efforts toward market dominance."" 
We express no opinion as to whether the district judge abused his discretion in ruling these items inadmissible because we find 
that even if admitted they would not have been sufficient evidence of specific intent. Without any evidence of Continental's 
reaction to McKinsey's recommendation, the report, while possibly relevant to the issue, could not establish Continental's intent. 
The sales reports were equally inadequate because they contained no indication that Continental did, or should, seek to achieve 
its objectives by means of anticompetitive strategies. Even in the aggregate, this evidence was insufficient to prove specific 
intent to monopolize."
1142,8," Inglis argues that it was also entitled to demonstrate the necessary effect by showing a substantial possibility of injury to 
competition through market analysis. Our circuit has not yet accepted or rejected this alternative means of proving 
anticompetitive effect. See Inglis I, 668 F.2d at 1042 & n. 49. We decline to reach the question here because we find that Inglis' 
market analysis failed to show the substantial possibility of injury to competition. "
1143,9," What Continental characterizes as Inglis' ""admission"" occurred during an extended argument over the significance of a 
damages exhibit. Both Inglis' expert witness and counsel stated that the intensity of market competition would have compelled 
Continental to price its private label bread below its average total cost. Inglis now argues that these statements were intended as 
part of the damages case only, and should have no relevance to liability. We do not reach this issue because we conclude that 
the alleged admission is irrelevant to the evidentiary burdens established by the California statute."
1143,10," The rationality or wisdom of § 17071 as applied to ""normal"" market conditions, in which sellers are able to sell at or above total 
cost, is not at issue here. We accept, for purposes of this appeal, the soundness of § 17071's evidentiary presumption under 
those circumstances, and concern ourselves only with whether the particular market condition identified by Continental renders 
the presumption irrational in that application."
1143,11," With respect to the fourth quarter of 1970, for example, Inglis alleged that Continental's average total cost was 22 cents, that 
the market would have allowed sales at a price somewhere between 18.2 cents and 22 cents, and that Continental sold at 18 
cents. See Plaintiff's Exhibit 501 and Transcript at 1852-54."
1143,12," Continental also argues that § 17071 conflicts with federal law by allowing a jury to condemn a price below average total cost 
where it was not possible to obtain a higher price. We need not reach this issue, however, because this case does not present 
that scenario. Inglis admitted only that the market would not have permitted Continental to sell at or above average total cost; it 
did not admit - and expressly denied - that the market would not have allowed Continental to sell at a price higher than the price 
Continental actually charged. "
1144,13," Continental bases its argument here entirely on federal law. This fact may indicate that Continental does not intend to 
challenge the causation element of the state law claim, in which case there is no need for us to consider it. Alternatively, 
Continental may intend for this argument to apply to the state claim, thus impliedly contending that state standards on causation 
are identical to federal standards. Granting Continental the benefit of the doubt, we construe the argument in the second way. 
We thus assume arguendo that the federal standard applies, and reject Continental's challenge because Inglis satisfied the 
federal standard for causation."
1144,14," Continental intimated at trial, for example, that during particular periods between 1970 and 1976 Inglis may have suffered a 
loss in profits regardless of Continental's pricing. See Transcript at 1912-13."
1144,15," McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1988), does not support Continental's theory on causation. In 
McGlinchy, we upheld the district court's decision to exclude the plaintiff's evidence on damages because it failed to meet the 
standard for competent evidence as to any of the claimed injury. Among the several serious flaws in the McGlinchy evidence 
that distinguish it from Inglis' evidence in this case are the following: failure to relate asserted lost profits to any specific acts by 
the defendants; concession that the decline in sales, which was responsible for lost profits, could have been caused by 
""anything""; failure to state which particular lines of plaintiff's business had suffered declining sales, even though plaintiff's theory 
was that defendant's unlawful conduct had affected particular lines.  845 F.2d at 806-07. "
1145,16," E&W used the measure it called ""average variable cost"". See note 4 and accompanying text supra."
1145,17," Continental claims that it was wrong to include the entire period from late 1970 to early 1976 in this calculation, arguing that 
not every price charged by Continental through this period was unlawful, and citing E&W's own data showing that there were 
occasions when Continental priced above cost. However, the particular data to which Continental refers involves only what E&W 
called ""average variable cost."" With respect to liability on the state claim, only average total cost is relevant; and E&W's study 
showed that Continental's prices were below that measure throughout the entire period involved."
1145,18," Continental also introduced evidence that federal price controls were implemented during the liability period, but Inglis 
countered with evidence that Continental could have sought relief from price controls. The jury could have accepted Inglis' theory 
that price controls were not a substantial factor in pricing during the liability period."
1145,19," Our conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to support use of the base period figures makes it unnecessary to address 
two further arguments Continental offers against Inglis' calculation of lost profits: (1) that it was improper to assume that, if 
Continental had increased its price, others would have followed, and (2) that it was improper to assume that, if prices had been 
increased, the quantity sold would not have declined. "
1146,20," With respect to the state claim, the district court and we sit in diversity and must base decisions affecting postjudgment 
interest on state law. See Michael-Regan Co., Inc. v. Lindell, 527 F.2d 653, 659 (9th Cir. 1975). "
1147,21, See note 1 supra.
1147,22," Inglis' cross-appeal challenges the amount of the deduction resulting from the Campbell-Taggart settlement. We deal with that 
question in Section III, C, infra. We are concerned here only with the question whether the deduction should be made before or 
after trebling of the damages. "
1148,23, See section I supra.
1148,24," Inglis bases its argument here entirely on federal law. This fact may indicate that Inglis does not intend to challenge the 
causation element of the state law claim, in which case we need not consider the issue. Alternatively, Inglis may intend for this 
argument to apply to the state claim, thus impliedly contending that the state approach to interest accrual is identical to the 
federal approach. Granting Inglis the benefit of the doubt, we construe the argument in the second way. We therefore assume 
arguendo that the federal approach applies, and reject Inglis' challenge because the court acted consistently with federal law by 
awarding interest only from the date of judgment on the second trial's verdicts. "
1172,1," Motions to dismiss were filed by defendants Akzo N.V., Pharmaceutical Basics, Inc., Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Quad 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., American Therapeutics, Inc., Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raj Matkari, Ashok Patel, Dilip Shah, Raju 
Vegesna, American Home Products Corporation, Quantum Pharmics, Ltd., Walter Kletch, Jan Sturm, and Stephen Colton. 
Mohammed Azeem, Charles Chang, David Brancato, and Jin-Shung Chang, none of whom are represented by counsel in this 
matter, did not file motions. "
1173,2," Mylan also alleges the existence of additional unnamed conspirators whose existence and identity is not relevant to the present 
motion."
1173,3," Most, if not all, of Mylan's factual allegations have been gleaned from the records of the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives which investigated the FDA generic 
drug scandal. The information obtained in the course of this investigation was submitted to the United States Attorney for the 
District of Maryland, who proceeded to file criminal charges against certain of the defendants in this case. To date, all 
defendants charged, both corporate and individual, have pled guilty. "
1176,4," Quantum produced FDA records which indicated the order of approval. Mylan does not argue that this Court may not take 
notice of the official public records of the FDA; however, Mylan urges the Court not to rely on these records in deciding this 
preliminary motion as the records alone do not tell the complete story and Mylan should have the opportunity to develop its facts 
through discovery. The Court does not need to rely on the records produced by Quantum given its disposition of Mylan's antitrust 
claims below."
1176,5," Courts have recognized price fixing, bid rigging, horizontal market division, (certain) tying arrangements, and (certain) boycotts 
as per se violations of the Sherman Act."
1176,6," In response to defendants' motion, Mylan states that the relevant geographic market is the United States and that the relevant 
product market is whatever drug is named in the specific count. Mylan's global antitrust count relates to all of the drugs allegedly 
produced in competition with Mylan's and the 36 restricted antitrust counts relate to various specific drugs, in some instances, 
dosages. Defendants continue to argue that Mylan's product market designation is insufficient because it does not state where 
and how competition occurred: in drug development, approval, or marketing."
1176,7," See infra Part V (D), re Implausible Conspiracy."
1176,8," Defendants argue that the actions of which Mylan complains may give rise to an unfair competition claim, but that unfair 
competition is still competition as required by the Sherman Act. See Merkle Press, Inc. v. Merkle, 519 F. Supp. 50 (D.Md. 1981) 
(Courts must be circumspect in converting ordinary business torts into antitrust violations); Seaboard Supply Co. v. Congoleum 
Corp., 770 F.2d 367 (3d Cir. 1985) (Commercial bribery not within scope of antitrust laws). Defendants argue that the 
accelerated approvals merely increased the options offered the consumer whether the drug was the first generic on the market 
(thus providing a lower cost alternative to an innovator) or a later entrant (providing more generic alternatives). Mylan itself characterized competition in the generic drug industry as intense. Mylan alleges that HN7[
] the first generic 
approved by the FDA wins a disproportionate share of the market. This phenomenon is inherent in the regulatory structure 
mandated by Congress, however, and is not itself grounds for an antitrust suit. See U.S. v. Rock Royal Co-op., 307 U.S. 533, 
560, 83 L. Ed. 1446, 59 S. Ct. 993 (1939), discussed infra note 11. As alleged, defendants' actions did not change the nature of "
1177,," competition in the generic drug industry, they only affected the composition of the class of competitors. Thus, there is no 
anticompetitive effect compensable by the antitrust laws. See infra note 9."
1177,9," Defendants argue that Mylan was not injured by a lack of competition in the generic drug industry but by an overabundance of 
it. This distinction is critical to Mylan's right to bring an antitrust suit: HN8[
] to bring a private suit under the Sherman Act, the 
plaintiff must have suffered an ""antitrust injury,"" that is, an injury resulting from the restraint on and reduction of competition. 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977) The law requires more than 
an injury ""causally linked to an illegal presence in the market."" Id. Instead, ""Plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that 
flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the 
violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. This rule stems from the Court's recognition that HN9[
] the antitrust laws exist to prevent a lessening of competition, not to 
protect individual competitors from the effects of competition, id. at 488, and has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 109-10, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986), and most recently in 
Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990), a case in which the Court 
required a showing of antitrust injury even in cases involving per se violations of the antitrust laws. 110 S. Ct. at 1893-5. HN10[
] ""Conduct in violation of the antitrust laws may have three effects, often interwoven: in some respects the conduct 
may reduce competition, in other respects it may increase competition, and in still other respects effects may be neutral as 
to competition. The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from an [sic] 
competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior. The need for this showing is at least as great under the 
per se rule as under the rule of reason."" Id. at 1894. In this case, the injury of which Mylan complains basically resulted from the uncompetitive aspects of the regulatory system 
mandated by Congress rather than any uncompetitive actions by defendants. Although defendants are alleged to have abused 
this system, their taking advantage does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Mylan suffered an antitrust injury. Obviously, the analysis under this head is somewhat duplicative of the analysis on the restraint of competition issue. Supra note 
8. Having held that Mylan has not sufficiently alleged an anticompetitive effect, this Court cannot now hold that Mylan has 
suffered an antitrust injury. HN11[
] ""Tortious activities in the form, for example, of unfair competition, do not contravene the antitrust laws unless accompanied 
by the requisite anticompetitive effect. Losing business to a competitor is an inevitable consequence of the economic 
system that the Sherman Act was designed to protect; some enterprises will prevail and others will not, but it is the function 
of section 1 to compensate the unfortunate only when their demise is accompanied by a generalized injury to the market."" Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1109 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. den. 470 U.S. 1054, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. 
Ct. 1758 (1985)."
1177,10," See infra Part V (C), re Noerr-Pennington Immunity. "
1178,11," HN14[
] Noerr-Pennington immunity does apply to attempts to influence agency action even where individualized decision-
making (versus regulation of broader application) is involved, unless the attempts come within the ""sham"" exception, as Mylan 
argues here. See California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972) 
(Plaintiffs alleged conspiracy ""to institute state and federal proceedings to resist and defeat applications by respondents to 
acquire operating rights or to transfer or register those rights."" 404 U.S. at 509. Court held that attempts to influence 
administrative agencies ""creatures of the legislature, and arms of the executive,"" id. at 510, were protected by Noerr-Pennington 
unless the attempts were ""a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the 
business relationships of a competitor."" Id. at 511 (quoting Noerr, 365 U.S. at 144). This may be demonstrated by a pattern of 
baseless, repetitive claims by the conspirators which effectively bar respondents from access to the agencies. Id. at 513.) "
1179,12," Mylan has argued that the Omni decision does not shield the FDA defendants from antitrust liability: as governmental actors, 
they are not entitled to Noerr immunity; and as federal governmental actors, they are not entitled to the state action immunity 
established in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). See Mylan's Post-hearing letter to the Court 
at 1-2. HN18[
] State action immunity was established in Parker in recognition of the ""role of sovereign States in a federal system."" Omni, 111 S. Ct. at 1349. ""The rationale of Parker was that, in light of our national commitment to federalism, the general language of the Sherman 
Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign 
regulators."" Id. at 1351; see Parker, 317 U.S. at 351, 352. As Mylan says, HN19[
] state action immunity has never been used to shield the 
actions of the federal government: as supreme sovereign within our federal system, the United States has no need to borrow the 
sovereign immunity of its constituent states. See U.S. v. Rock Royal Co-op., 307 U.S. 533, 560, 83 L. Ed. 1446, 59 S. Ct. 993 
(1939) (""If the [Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937] and the [Secretary of Agriculture's Order No. 27, issued "
1180,," thereunder] are otherwise valid, the fact that their effect would be to give cooperatives a monopoly of the market would not 
violate the Sherman Act[.]""); U.S. v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. Ct. 742 (1941) (The United States 
held not to be a ""person"" as the term was used in the Sherman Act; hence, could neither bring suit or be sued. ""Since, in 
common usage, the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to 
exclude it.""); Rex Systems, Inc. v. Holiday, 814 F.2d 994, 997 (4th Cir. 1987) (Though Congress reacted to the Cooper decision 
by amending the anti-trust laws to permit the United States to bring suit, ""the rationale of Cooper relating to the federal 
government's role as an anti-trust defendant remains unaffected. [. . .] Since defendants Holiday and Lehman were sued in their 
official capacities, this reasoning applies to them also. Therefore, we hold that all the federal defendants are not 'persons' under 
the Sherman Act and so subject to suit against them.""); Strickland v. Flue-Cured Tobacco Co-op., 643 F. Supp. 310, 321 (D.S.C. 
1986) (""It is well-settled, however, that HN20[
] the federal government and its agencies are immune from antitrust liability. [. . 
.] In addition, private parties with whom the Government and its agencies deal are not subject to the antitrust laws."" (citations 
omitted)). Though the FDA employees named as defendants are alleged to have acted in an improper and unauthorized manner, this does 
not affect their entitlement to immunity. See Omni, 111 S. Ct. at 1349 (discussing municipality's authority to regulate: ""It could be 
argued, however, that a municipality acts beyond its delegated authority, for Parker purposes, whenever the nature of its 
regulation is substantively or even procedurally defective. [. . .] Such an expansive interpretation of the Parker-defense 
authorization requirement would have unacceptable consequences.""); Rex Systems, 814 F.2d at 995-6 (Government defendants 
alleged to have violated their own procurement laws held not subject to the antitrust laws)."
1180,13," Despite this Court's conclusion that the Noerr-Pennington analysis requires dismissal of Mylan's antitrust claims, the 
conspiracy issue shall also be examined. Not only does it implicate the viability of Mylan's antitrust claims, but it is also critical to 
the survival of Mylan's § 1962(d) RICO conspiracy claim. See infra Part VI."
1180,14," On June 18, 1991 the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's dismissal of this case and remanded it for further proceedings. 
The Court did not address the District Court's conspiracy analysis. 938 F.2d 919, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 12336."
1180,15," Defendants have also attacked Mylan's individual antitrust conspiracy counts. In each of these counts, 5 through 40, Mylan 
alleges a conspiracy between the corporate manufacturer, the individual agents, and the FDA defendants. It is established that 
HN22[
] a corporation is legally incapable of conspiring with its subsidiary in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984); Advanced Health-Care 
Services v. Radford Community Hospital, 910 F.2d 139, 146 (4th Cir. 1990) (Following Copperweld, the Fourth Circuit concludes 
""that two subsidiaries wholly owned by the same parent corporation are legally incapable of conspiring with one another for 
purposes of § 1 of the Sherman Act.""). Similarly, a corporation cannot conspire with its agents. Marmott v. Maryland Lumber Co., 
807 F.2d 1180, 1184 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. den. 482 U.S. 929, 96 L. Ed. 2d 700, 107 S. Ct. 3214 (1987). Thus, only the alleged 
agreements between the individual manufacturer defendants and the specific FDA defendants with whom they were dealing is of 
any relevance to Mylan's individual antitrust conspiracy counts. The corporate defendants argue that there were no cognizable 
conspiracies between them and the FDA defendants as the FDA defendants were mere ""pawns"" rather than co-conspirators. 
See In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 560 F. Supp. 760, 777 (D.Md. 1983) (re defendants as mere pawns of the 
conspiracy rather than coconspirators); Harold Friedman, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 581 F.2d 1068, 1072-6 (3d Cir. 1978) (""Pawn"" 
defined in terms of knowledge of the anticompetitive intent and scheme). For the purposes of discussion of the global conspiracy 
issues, the Court is willing to assume that such individual conspiracies have been alleged. See infra note 16. This does not 
affect the dismissal of counts 5 through 40, however, which is proper for the other reasons discussed above. "
1181,16," See supra note 15. Certain manufacturer defendants assert that the allegations of gratuities paid do not support the inference 
of an agreement with the FDA defendants because the manufacturer defendants did not, in fact, receive any prompter approval 
than would have been granted absent the gratuity. They have produced FDA records to demonstrate that the order of approval 
was in line with the order of submission of the ANDA. For the purposes of the motions to dismiss, however, the Court shall 
accept Mylan's allegations of quid pro quo as true notwithstanding the records produced by defendants."
1181,17," Mylan cites this case as authority for the proposition that rimless conspiracy is recognized in antitrust law. The case does not 
so hold. In fact, the court analyzes in detail the allegations and evidence regarding the existence of agreement between the 
dealers, i.e. the rim, before considering whether the organizer of this horizontal conspiracy can also be held as a coconspirator. 
The court first notes that ""consciously parallel business behavior without more does not entitle plaintiff to directed verdict in his 
favor,"" 560 F. Supp. at 772, and then goes on to consider the various ""plus factors"", such as evidence of dealer meetings, which 
permit the inference of conspiracy. 560 F. Supp. at 772-5."
1181,18," Defendants in Tillett were both convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana in violation of RICO and both argued that the 
evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The Fourth Circuit considered the issue whether one or two conspiracies had 
been established by the evidence and held that the jury reasonably concluded that by agreeing to captain boats for the central 
figure Holland on two separate occasions and by participating in the off-load of drugs, defendants understood that they were 
participating in an ongoing business. 763 F.2d at 632-3. "
1182,19," Rastelli and Griffin are cases dealing with a RICO associated-in-fact enterprise. See infra Part V. Both cases, however, 
support the distinction between agreement as to the essential elements of the conspiracy (necessary) and knowledge of the 
details of the conspiracy (not necessary)."
1182,20," Monsanto was tried to a jury which had found that the termination of the plaintiff-distributor was pursuant to a conspiracy 
between Monsanto and one or more of its distributors to set resale prices. 465 U.S. at 757-8."
1182,21," The Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether there was other evidence ""sufficiently 
unambiguous to permit a trier of fact to find that petitioners conspired to price predatorily for two decades despite the absence of 
any apparent motive to do so."" 475 U.S. at 597. "
1183,22," Mylan argues that the fact that the manufacturer defendants all dealt with the same FDA officials permits the inference of 
concerted action. Mylan has alleged, however, that ANDA approval responsibility was concentrated in these few people; thus the 
coincidence alleged does not lead to the inference argued. "
1184,23, See infra note 43. 
1185,24," This distinction is not required by § 1962(a). Busby v. Crown Supply, Inc., 896 F.2d 833, 841 (4th Cir. 1990)."
1185,25," The Court also questioned whether the employee's acts could truly have been said to have been within the scope of his 
employment. ""An employee violating RICO without his employer's knowledge is highly unlikely to be acting for his employer's 
benefit."" 838 F.2d at 967."
1185,26," Mylan may not be able to prove that the acts of the various corporate employees were not isolated unauthorized sprees, as 
the corporate defendants contend that they were. For the purposes of this 12(b) motion, however, the Court will assume that ""an 
officer or director had knowledge of, or was recklessly indifferent toward, the unlawful activity."" Gruber, 679 F. Supp. at 181. The 
Court does recognize, however, that the doctrine of respondeat superior may be more limited in RICO cases than in other cases 
so that the authority cited by Mylan is less compelling than it would appear. Compare U.S. v. Automated Medical Laboratories, 
Inc., 770 F.2d 399, 406-7 (4th Cir. 1985) (Corporation charged with conspiracy to submit false documents to the United States 
may be held criminally liable for unlawful practices if agents were acting within the scope of their employment: performing acts of 
the kind authorized to and motivated at least in part by an intent to benefit the corporation; this despite the corporation's 
protestations that the agents' falsification of the logs was unauthorized and against company rules.); and D & S Auto Parts, 838 
F.2d at 968 (The rule of respondeat superior as applied in antitrust cases is not applicable to RICO which does ""indicate 
Congressional intent to create an exception to the general rule of respondeat superior.""). "
1186,27," On November 18, 1988, Congress added 18 U.S.C. § 1346 to the mail fraud chapter in order to overturn the effect of the 
McNally decision and reinstate the pre-McNally law that deprivation of honest services was covered by the mail fraud statute. 
The acts alleged in the complaint appear to have occurred prior to the effective date of § 1346, and no party has briefed the 
potential applicability of the section. Accordingly, the Court has restricted its consideration of this issue to the cases discussed 
below and is of the opinion, having reviewed the cases, that the section does not apply to this case -- factually or legally. "
1187,28," In Martinez the Third Circuit relied in part on two Eastern District of New York cases, U.S. v. Turoff, 701 F. Supp. 981 
(E.D.N.Y. 1988), and U.S. v. Berg, 710 F. Supp. 438 (E.D.N.Y. 1989), aff'd in part; rev'd in part U.S. v. Schwartz, 924 F.2d 410 
(2nd Cir. 1991), which are no longer good law given the Second Circuit's most recent pronouncement on the issue. In U.S. v. 
Schwartz, 924 F.2d 410 (2nd Cir. 1991), the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment in Berg and held that the arms 
export licenses were not property within the meaning of the fraud statutes."
1187,29," See Medical Inc. v. Angicor Ltd., 677 F. Supp. 1000, 1005 (D.Minn. 1988) (""The FDA's interest in approving exports is more 
similar to the intangible right of the citizenry to good government than the intangible property right a business has in its 
confidential business information. [. . .] The purpose of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is to protect the consuming public. [. . 
.] The process of obtaining export approval is simply a method used by the FDA to protect the consuming public abroad.  While 
export approval likely has a definite and measurable value to the recipient, there is no indication that the FDA has any financial 
interest, tangible or intangible, in issuing or not issuing export approval. Consequently, the FDA does not have a cognizable 
property interest under the mail fraud statute in granting export approval""). "
1188,30," Evans was not actually decided on this issue. Instead, the Second Circuit ruled on the license-as-property issue discussed 
above. Similarly, in Corcoran, supra, the court discussed the issue of identity of the deceived and the injured, on which issue the 
district court had followed the dicta of Corcoran, 886 F.2d at 19-20, but held that the government as a regulator was not 
protected by the mail fraud statute.  Id. at 21."
1188,31, See supra note 30.
1188,32," Interestingly, the court in Shaw cited the Fourth Circuit case of Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F.2d 1179 (4th Cir. 1988) for the 
proposition that in a suit for mail fraud the intended victim need not show detrimental reliance on the mailed misrepresentations, "
1189,," but refused to follow the Brandenburg holding that under RICO, § 1964(c), the private plaintiff must have relied on and been 
injured by the misrepresentations."
1189,33," See infra note 32. In Brandenburg the Court construed 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which provides for a private civil action, as 
requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate an injury caused by the predicate acts of the defendant. 859 F.2d at 1187. The Court affirmed 
the district court's dismissal of the RICO counts for lack of such a demonstration. ""The Amended Complaint contains no specific allegation that the named or class plaintiffs acted in reliance on any 
misrepresentations directly made by the MSSIC defendants when they decided to deposit their money in First National."" Id. at 1188. The Fourth Circuit did note that it is not necessary to establish detrimental reliance by the victim in order to make 
out a violation of the mail fraud statute, Id. n. 10; however, its holding with regard to RICO injury suggests some concern with the 
convergence issue. Mylan has produced the Fourth Circuit's slip opinion in Wolf v. Klein, 907 F.2d 1141, 16 Fed. Rules Serv. 3d 1222 (4th Cir. 
1990); however, the part cited as relevant by Mylan has not been published (hence the need for the slip opinion) and the 
language quoted does not actually address the issue as the Court was concerned with other matters. Accordingly, this Court 
does not regard Wolf as authority for the proposition for which it was cited."
1189,34," HN34[
] Federal Rule 9(b): Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind. ""In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. 
Malice, intent, knowledge and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally."" "
1190,35, Obstruction of justice.
1190,36," Tampering with a witness, victim or informant."
1190,37, Apparently not defendant Ashok Patel.
1190,38," For instance, Vegesna is alleged to have falsified still more ATI records after receiving a Congressional subpoena; R. Patel 
sent the wrong batch sample in response to an FDA query. "
1191,39," The difficulty led the concurrence to note ""That the highest Court in the land has been unable to derive from this statute 
anything more than today's meager guidance bodes ill for the day when that [constitutionally void for vagueness] challenge is 
presented."" 492 U.S. at 256 (Scalia, J., concurring). Although defendants have presented that challenge here, this Court 
declines to hold the statute unconstitutional in this civil application."
1191,40," This reflected the Fourth Circuit's earlier statement in Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F.2d 1179, 1185 (4th Cir. 1988), that the 
issue of pattern requires a ""carefully considered judgment taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case -- with special attention to the context in which the predicate acts occur."" "
1192,41," Matkari is actually alleged to have been the employee of PBI not Akzo. Akzo is only named in Mylan's suit because it is the 
parent company of PBI; unlike Par, it is not alleged to have had any agents busily undermining the raison d'etre of the FDA. The 
propriety of piercing the corporate veil to hold Akzo in this litigation has been raised in Akzo's motion to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction, and will be considered in ruling on that motion. For the limited purpose of this discussion, the Court 
assumes Akzo is responsible but expresses no opinion on the issue. "
1193,42," This holding is not a little affected by Mylan's allegations regarding PBI's alleged corporate predecessor My-K, which through 
its agent Bae, is alleged to have had an extensive history of improper payments made to FDA officials. Akzo/PBI argues that this 
conduct is not properly attributable to it under the general rule that a corporation that acquires the assets of another corporation 
is not ordinarily liable for the liabilities of that predecessor corporation. Smith v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 737 F. Supp. 1446, 
1448 (D.Md. 1988). This general rule is subject to exceptions, of course, so that liability will be imposed on a successor 
corporation where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger. Id. Mylan argues that this exception applies in this 
case. The facts surrounding the transferral of My-K's assets to PBI are obviously in conflict and not susceptible to resolution on a 
motion to dismiss. The Court will not consider the extra-pleading references included by defendants at this stage. The tactical 
decisions of the United States Attorney in determining who to charge with what criminal conduct may have little to do with the 
legal standards for imposing civil liability."
1193,43," See U.S. v. Biaggi, 909 F.2d 662, 686 (2nd Cir. 1990), cert. den. 499 U.S. 904, 111 S. Ct. 1102, 113 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1991). ""Neglia contends that the bribe and the false denial of it, though obviously bearing the requisite 'relationship' to each other, 
[. . .] lack the requisite 'continuity' to establish a 'pattern.' That may well be so, but the more basic objection is that 
aggregating the bribe and its denial into a 'pattern' perverts the meaning of that word, at least as it is used in the RICO 
statute. The 'pattern' element guards against permitting RICO to be used against sporadic criminal activity. Neglia's bribe 
does not cease to be a sporadic offense simply because he later falsely denied committing it. If the commission of an 
offense and its false denial count establish a 'pattern,' then every offense related to a criminal enterprise would be eligible 
for inclusion in a pattern whenever the offender falsely denied its commission. That is not what Congress intended."""
1193,44," Defendants cite Benard v. Hoff, 727 F. Supp. 211, 215 (D.Md. 1989), in which this Court said, with no analysis, ""corporations 
cannot under RICO associate in fact to constitute an enterprise."" This statement was actually at odds with the decisions of a "
1194,," number of Courts of Appeals which have held that corporations can associate in fact to constitute an enterprise.  United States 
v. Huber, 603 F.2d 387, 394 (2nd Cir. 1979), cert. den. 445 U.S. 927, 63 L. Ed. 2d 759, 100 S. Ct. 1312 (1980); United States v. 
Perholtz, 268 U.S. App. D.C. 347, 842 F.2d 343, 352-3 (D.C.Cir. 1988), cert. den. 488 U.S. 821, 102 L. Ed. 2d 42, 109 S. Ct. 65 
(1988) (authorities listed therein). The Fourth Circuit has not yet held on the issue. See Entre Computer Centers v. FMG of 
Kansas City, 819 F.2d 1279, 1287 (4th Cir. 1987)."
1194,45," HN42[
] A distinction between the ""person"" and the ""enterprise"" is necessary for a § 1962(c) claim but is not required for a §"
1194,1962," (a) claim. Busby v. Crown Supply, Inc., 896 F.2d 833, 841 (4th Cir. 1990). "
1196,46," In fact, HN47[
] public entities such as the FDA have been recognized as enterprises within the meaning of the statute. See U.S. v. Baker, 617 F.2d 1060, 1061 (4th Cir. 1980) (Fourth Circuit held that county sheriff's office was an enterprise within the 
meaning of RICO). "
1197,47," The Fourth Circuit cited Welch in United States v. Webster, 669 F.2d 185 (4th Cir. 1982), cert. den. 456 U.S. 935, 72 L. Ed. 2d 
455, 102 S. Ct. 1991 (1982), when disavowing some poorly chosen language in the original Webster opinion, 639 F.2d 174 (4th 
Cir. 1981). In Webster I, the Court had referred to ""conducted"" the affairs of the enterprise as synonymous with ""benefitted"" the 
enterprise. The Court recanted this approach after the Fifth Circuit's Welch decision, which criticized the Webster opinion. As the 
Court said in Webster II, ""The problem with the approach we took immediately surfaces in cases where the enterprise is governmental in nature, and 
almost universally not organized for profit. See United States v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039, 1061 (5th Cir. 1981)."""
1197,669, F.2d at 186.
1197,48," More recently the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have adopted a three-part test for determining when there is an adequate nexus 
between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise alleged. U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. den. 
465 U.S. 1005, 79 L. Ed. 2d 229, 104 S. Ct. 996 (1984); Overnite Transport Co. v. Truck Drivers, etc. Local No. 705, 904 F.2d 
391 (7th Cir. 1990) (Three part test for analyzing alleged nexus: 1. The defendant must have committed racketeering acts; 2. 
The defendant's position in or relation to the enterprise facilitated those acts; 3. The racketeering acts affected the enterprise, 
though the effect need not be beneficial.) These courts have not disavowed their earlier specific findings of nexus, however; in 
fact, the Fifth Circuit in Cauble cited U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 915, 102 S. Ct. 1767, 
72 L. Ed. 2d 173, 102 S. Ct. 1768 (1982), a law enforcement bribery case which followed Bright closely. 706 F.2d at 1332 n. 22. "
1198,49," The proceeds of racketeering activities are alleged to be the profits from the sales of generic drugs on which defendants got 
improper FDA approval because of the alleged bribery. Mylan has listed the particular drugs in its complaint. Several defendants 
assert that they did not receive any improper approval of the listed ANDAs, that despite any payments made to FDA officials, 
they did not receive the swift approval alleged by Mylan. This is, of course, irrelevant to the sufficiency of Mylan's allegations. "
1199,50," Defendants also argue that with regard to Mylan's § 1962(a) claim, Mylan must show injury by reason of the investment of the 
racketeering income and not merely injury by reason of the acts themselves. This argument has been foreclosed, of course, by 
the Fourth Circuit's holding in Busby v. Crown Supply, Inc., 896 F.2d 833 (4th Cir. 1990), that ""the 'investment use' rule is 
flawed,"" 896 F.2d at 837, and rejected it. Instead, the Court referred to its holding in Brandenburg, and reiterated that HN53[
] 
""a traditional causation analysis [must be employed] in determining whether a RICO plaintiff has been injured 'by reason of' a 
section 1962 violation."" 896 F.2d at 839."

1199,52," The relationship between Viterine's predicate acts, obstruction of justice, and Mylan's alleged injury may be more problematic. 
As Viterine has not raised the issue of causation, however, this Court declines to address it. "
1203,1," Minnesota antitrust law is interpreted consistently with federal case law developed under the Sherman Act. See Campbell v. 
Motion Picture Machine Operators' Union of Minneapolis, Local 219, 151 Minn. 220, 186 N.W. 781 (1922). "
1215,1," The third-party complaint states that as of 1983 -- that is, prior to deregulation of pay telephone services -- NYTel controlled 
100% of the pay telephones in the same geographic area. "
1216,2, Which in NAI's case has totalled more than $ 1 million. 
1219,3," The statute has recently been revised to state, inter alia:"
1219,3," . (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision or section ninety-two-c of this article, a reseller of telephone service 
by means of a customer owned or leased currency operated telephone (COCOT) shall be exempt from the requirements of 
this chapter. (2) The commission shall have power to establish by rule or regulation minimum service, rate, interconnection and location 
requirements for COCOTs upon a determination that such requirements are in the public interest. (McKinney's Supp. 1991) I do not find the changes relevant to the state action analysis. "
1220,4," Although this claim seems largely duplicative of NAI's antitrust claim, in that NAI has no obligation to pay these charges 
because the fraud could have been avoided but for NYTel's monopolistic behavior, NAI's Answer holds out the possibility that 
there is in addition some contract defense to these claims: if the calls are not ""valid,"" then NAI has no obligation under its 
agreement with AT & T to pay for them. "
1231,1," Honorable Rodney S. Webb, United States District Judge for the District of North Dakota. "
1249,1," Demonstrating that an alleged agreement would affect interstate commerce has been treated as a jurisdictional prerequisite to 
bringing a section one claim that must be satisfied before the other two elements of such a claim are addressed. See Summit 
Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S 322, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 59 U.S.L.W. 4493 (1991). Oksanen notes that the 
hospital and its staff purchase supplies and receive insurance payments from out-of-state sources and that they treat non-
Virginia residents. Oksanen further alleges that the peer review process was used as a vehicle to punish him for sending 
patients to other area hospitals, which were engaged in interstate commerce. Finally, Oksanen argues that the peer review 
process serves a gate-keeping function so that an unfavorable review from Page Memorial could affect his ability to obtain staff 
privileges at other hospitals. Based on the similarity between Oksanen's allegations and those allegations considered by the 
Pinhas Court to affect interstate commerce, we believe that the jurisdictional requirement for an antitrust action is met in this 
case. "
1250,2," In the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Congress specifically found that ""the threat of . . . treble damage liability 
under Federal anti-trust law unreasonably discourages physicians from participating in effective professional peer review."" 
Congress further noted that ""there is an overriding national need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in 
effective professional peer review."" 42 U.S.C. § 11101(4) & (5). This legislation, however, is not controlling in this litigation which 
concerns events occurring before the Act's effective date. "
1257,1," The majority's cite to Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 102 L. Ed. 2d 
110, 109 S. Ct. 137 (1988), is inapposite. In Collins, discovery had been completed prior to summary judgment and the court 
noted that the district judge ""painstakingly examined the voluminous discovery material . . . ."" Id. at 475. "
1258,2," For example, in part C, the majority declares that ""there is no evidence that the staff attempted to usurp the Board's power . . ."" 
At 706. It adds, ""Nor is there any evidence that the staff illicitly agreed to exclude Oksanen from the market or engaged in 
anticompetitive activity outside the official meeting and hearing process."" Id. And it guesses as to the motivation of two doctors' 
refusal to provide on-call coverage for him: ""Quite likely, the medical staff members made independent decisions not to provide 
assistance to Oksanen when they could not expect much cooperation in return."" At 707. "

1266,2," After the first trial, the district court refused to rule on Roboserve's promissory estoppel claim until the second trial. R3-142-1. 
Our review of the record has not revealed any preliminary or final disposition of this claim. "
1269,3," These documents are identified by exhibit number from the second trial as follows: (1) Plaintiff's Exhibit (""PX"") 92, dated 
September 7, 1984 (Tom's internal memorandum); (2) PX 94, dated October 30, 1984 (Tom's Monthly Operations Report); (3) 
PX 102-00138, dated December 3, 1984 (Tom's internal correspondence); (4) PX 100, dated December 4, 1984 (Tom's internal 
memorandum); (5) PX 102, dated December 20, 1984 (Tom's internal memorandum); (6) Defendant's Exhibit (""DX"") 258, dated 
January 3, 1985 (Tom's Purchase Order for 260 machines); (7) PX 115, undated (Tom's Draft Agreement with Roboserve); (8) 
PX 117, dated September 4, 1985 (Tom's internal correspondence); (9) PX 260, undated (Tom's Management Clearance 
Change Authorization); (10) PX 137, undated (Minutes of Tom's Board of Directors meeting on 1/15/86); (11) PX 135, dated 
January 9, 1986 (Tom's Purchase Requisition for 1000 machines); and (12) DX 259, dated February 12, 1986 (Tom's Purchase 
Order for 1000 machines). "
1270,4," Tom's purchase price was to be 8.25 cents per cup for the first 20 million cups per year, 7.75 cents for each cup over 20 million 
and up to 50 million per year, and 7.25 cents for each cup over 50 million per year."
1270,5," Reply and Response of the Plaintiff-Appellee-Cross Appellant Roboserve, Ltd. at 21. "
1272,6," Roboserve's damage exhibits were admitted into evidence as D-1 through D-116, so we will identify those exhibits as PX D-1 
through PX D-116."
1272,7," The jury awarded Roboserve $ 3,645,500 in compensatory damages for Count VI. If the entire award was attributable to lost 
sales of machines, and Tom's purchased the minimum number of machines required by the contract, then the present value of "
1273,," the average profit per machine sold would be approximately $ 260. Roboserve's average profit per machine sold in 1986 was 
substantially less than $ 260. See PX D-79 through PX D-82, PX D-93 through PX D-109. Therefore, we must assume that lost 
cup sales accounted for part of the jury's award of future profits. "
1274,8," Roboserve holds patents on discrete parts of the Stax machine, but raises no claim of patent infringement in this case. The 
Stax machine contains a combination of patented and unpatented parts; however, the machine itself is not protected by federal 
patent law. "
1280,1," This case involves vertical non-price restraints for which the per se test is inapplicable. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE 
Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 58-59 (1977)."
1280,2," Even under a pro se analysis, an antitrust injury is required. Atlantic Richfield Co. V. U.S.A. Petroleum Co.,    U.S.   , 110 S. Ct. 
1884, 1889 (1990)."
1280,3," It is also unclear what counterclaimants contend is the anticompetitive conspiracy or contract. The allegedly illegal procedures 
were undertaken pursuant to franchise agreements to which counterclaimants were parties. "
1281,4," Significantly, this is something counterclaimants never alleged in their pleadings. "
1286,1," Originally, all four plaintiffs in this case brought antitrust claims against these and several other defendants, but plaintiffs have 
consented to the dismissal of all antitrust claims except as described in the text. See Plaintiffs' Br. at 48."
1286,2," Forest Medical also asserts analogous claims under New Jersey's antitrust laws. See Complaint, Counts III and IV. However, 
New Jersey's antitrust laws are to be interpreted consistently with federal antitrust law. See N.J.S.A. 56:9-18. Consequently, as 
plaintiffs concede, to the extent the federal antitrust claims are dismissed the state antitrust claims should be dismissed as well. 
See Plaintiffs' Br. at 73."
1286,3," Because these issues alone warrant dismissal of all antitrust claims, I need not consider defendants' several additional 
arguments for granting summary judgment. "
1287,4," As already explained, dismissal of plaintiffs' federal antitrust claims necessarily requires dismissal of their state law antitrust 
claims as well; therefore, Counts III and IV of the complaint are dismissed in their entirety. See supra note 2. Plaintiffs also 
consent to the dismissal of Count II of the complaint, which claims that plaintiff Thomas Bellavia, M.D., was improperly denied 
reappointment as an attending physician in HMC's emergency room. "
1288,5," In defendants' view, the primary medical concern raised by Mr. Groover's transfer was that, even though Dr. Renner had only 
rarely treated patients with leaking thoracic aneurysms, see Deposition of Carl J. Renner, M.D., at 93-94 (June 9, 1988) 
(Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 1) (""Renner Dep.""), Dr. Renner made the decision to transfer Mr. Groover without making any 
attempt to seek a cardiac thoracic consultation with John Hutchinson, III, M.D., the chief of cardiac thoracic surgery at HMC. 
Renner Dep. at 89. This was so, defendants argue, even though Dr. Renner had been advised by Frank Nichols, M.D., a 
surgeon on the HMC medical staff, to consult with Dr. Hutchinson. Renner Dep. at 76."
1288,6," Plaintiffs allege that the error in treatment for Mr. Groover occurred prior to transfer, as a result of the alleged failure of Robert 
Krugman, M.D., a radiologist on the HMC medical staff, to make a timely diagnosis of Mr. Groover's condition. See Affidavit of 
Carl J. Renner, M.D., at P 4 (June 26, 1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. II, Ex. 1) (""Renner Aff.""); Renner Dep. at 65, 67 (Plaintiffs' 
Exhibits, Vol. III, Ex. 9). Plaintiffs further allege that Dr. Renner made the decision to transfer Mr. Groover to St. Michael's for several reasons: (1) Dr. 
Renner was upset about the delay in diagnosis; (2) the only person available, if at all, to perform the surgery at HMC was Dr. 
Hutchinson, and Dr. Renner had no knowledge of Dr. Hutchinson's qualifications because he was a recent addition to the 
hospital staff; (3) further, it was not even certain that Dr. Hutchinson was available to perform the surgery that day; (4) on the 
other hand, Dr. Renner had first hand knowledge of the skill of the cardio-thoracic surgeon at St. Michael's; and (5) Dr. Renner 
doubted whether HMC could provide appropriate follow up care. See Renner Aff., at PP 7-9; Renner Dep. at 77, 85, 89, 96-97 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. III, Exs. 13-14, 16-17). Finally, plaintiffs allege that no complications developed during the transfer, and that upon arrival at St. Michael's Mr. Groover's 
condition was unchanged and he was stable. Plaintiffs claim that Mr. Groover died as a result of his response to anesthesia, 
which was being administered prior to surgery. Renner Aff., at P 10. Despite the foregoing, however, plaintiffs do not appear to dispute the defendants' primary contention, to wit, that Dr. Renner 
transferred Mr. Groover without making any attempt to consult with Dr. Hutchinson, HMC's chief of cardiac surgery, even though 
Dr. Renner had been advised to do so by another physician. See Renner Dep. at 76, 89. "
1289,7," When Mr. Napolitano initially called Dr. Penner he was unavailable, but Dr. Bellavia, the senior physician at Heights Medical 
where Dr. Penner worked, returned the call, and stated that as the senior member of the group he would be happy to answer 
questions about the case. Napolitano Aff., at P 6."
1289,8," Plaintiffs also cite an affidavit from Dr. Charles Riccobono, a former member of Forest Medical, but in his affidavit Dr. 
Riccobono says nothing about why the Ad Hoc Board was created, but merely shares his speculation that ""such a committee 
could easily degenerate into a witchhunt."" Affidavit of Charles Riccobono, M.D., at P 12 (July 2, 1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. II, 
Ex. 6) (""Riccobono Aff.""). "
1290,9," In her most recent affidavit, Ms. Schneider apparently asserts that an affidavit previously sworn to by her was false or 
misleading (she does not explain exactly how), and that she was forced to sign this false affidavit at the behest of Deputy 
Attorney General Sandra Y. Dick, and Ms. Schneider's supervisor at BOME, Karl Koehler. See Schneider Aff., at P 24; see also 
Affidavit of Darleen Schneider (May 1, 1987) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Ex. 1). Needless to say, Ms. Dick and Mr. Koehler 
deny this accusation. See Affidavit of Sandra Y. Dick, at P 3 (July 11, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Ex. 3) (""Dick Aff.""); 
Affidavit of Karl Koehler, at P 6 (July 10, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Ex. 4) (""Koehler Aff.""). Much of Ms. Schneider's affidavit is spent not on the allegations of this lawsuit, but rather attacking the integrity of the BOME. 
Whatever merit these allegations may have, they appear to bear little relevance to the concerns of this case."
1290,10," Plaintiffs also contend that HMC's handling of a related issue was designed to manipulate the BOME inquiry to justify the 
""sham"" investigation by the Ad Hoc Board. According to Mr. Napolitano, in the course of the informal inquiry Drs. Gross and 
Weiner had concluded that there was no undue delay in making the diagnosis in the Groover case, and Dr. Gross embodied this 
conclusion in a letter to the BOME dated September 9, 1986. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 14. However, Mr. Napolitano 
advised Dr. Gross that this preliminary conclusion should not be communicated immediately to the BOME, until a complete 
investigation had occurred, in light of the other information Mr. Napolitano had gathered and his ongoing discussions with 
Deputy Attorney General Gelber. See Napolitano Aff., P 18. Plaintiffs assert that the sending of the letter to the BOME was 
delayed for six weeks, although I am unable to ascertain the basis for this conclusion. Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Gross believed that, having found no delay in diagnosis, ""they were finished,"" i.e., the matter was 
closed. Despite this, plaintiffs argue, HMC proceeded with its investigation. From this, plaintiffs reason as follows: The September 9, 1986 letter was withheld so that the Ad Hoc Advisory Board on Quality of Referrals could be created and not 
questioned with regard to a quality of care issue that no longer existed given the hospital's determination that there was no delay 
in diagnosis. The letter was withheld so that the Ad Hoc Advisory Board could be created and later assert the peer review 
privilege based on a quality of care issue that they felt never existed. Plaintiffs' Br., at 14. There are at least two problems with this argument. First, plaintiffs' contentions notwithstanding, Dr. Gross' deposition testimony, 
affidavit and testimony before the Ad Hoc Board consistently indicate his belief that while there was no delay in diagnosis, 
questions remained regarding the medical appropriateness of Mr. Groover's transfer and, in particular, whether the transfer was "
1291,," motivated by improper financial considerations. See Deposition of Peter Gross, M.D., at 59-60 (June 16, 1988) (Plaintiffs' 
Exhibits, Vol. III, Exs. 24-25); Affidavit of Peter R. Gross, M.D., at PP 7-8 (Mar. 11, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 2, Ex. 4>; 
Transcript of the Ad Hoc Board, at 4-5, 8 (Oct. 14, 1986) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 3). Second, plaintiffs' assertion that Dr. Gross' letter to the BOME was delayed in order to keep alive a phony reason for further 
investigation is pure speculation and finds no support in the record. In fact, in Mr. Napolitano's memorandum recommending 
further investigation he explicitly stated his belief that the diagnosis was ""prudent and appropriate,"" and instead urges 
investigation into Mr. Groover's transfer and potentially improper financial arrangements regarding patient referrals. See 
Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 4. It is difficult to understand why Mr. Napolitano would call the diagnosis prudent and 
appropriate if he was trying to manufacture an excuse for further inquiry. "
1292,11," Plaintiffs argue that the Ad Hoc Board was part of a broader effort by the HMC Board of Governors to encroach upon the 
medical prerogatives of the Medical Board, and that the Ad Hoc Board was a ""travesty"" of hospital procedures. For this 
proposition, plaintiffs apparently rely on the deposition testimony of one Dr. Kerdasha who, so far as one can tell, was an HMC 
staff member during the period in question, but is not otherwise identified by plaintiffs. Dr. Kerdasha apparently purports to speak 
for the entire Medical Board. See Deposition of Dr. Kerdasha, at 3, 6-7, 18, 106 (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. III, Exs. 32, 36, 38, 67) 
(""Kerdasha Dep.""). On cross-examination, Dr. Kerdasha conceded that the Board of Governors was responsible for the quality of 
medical care, and that it had access to the medical expertise necessary to make judgments about the quality of medical care. 
See Kerdasha Dep. at 3. It is unclear whether plaintiffs believe that the ""encroachment"" of which Dr. Kerdasha complains 
constitutes an actionable tort."
1292,12," As noted, Dr. Petriella asserts that somehow ""due process"" was denied when the Ad Hoc Board's report was sent to the 
BOME without first being reviewed by the Medical Board, but he does not identify what provisions of the Staff Bylaws were thus 
violated."
1292,13," The Ad Hoc Board's hearings were recorded and the witnesses who appeared were allowed to bring their attorneys, an 
opportunity used by both individual plaintiffs as well as several other physicians. Plaintiffs never say what, if any, additional 
procedures they were entitled to under the Staff Bylaws. "
1293,14," When asked by plaintiffs' counsel whether he considered the definition of multi-specialty group practice a complicated issue, 
Dr. Weiner said: A. Depends what you consider complicated. It is not a one-sentence definition. Q. Do you feel today competent to address it or 
to define it? A. I don't feel that I'm an expert on the subject. Q. Did any member of the committee, if you know, have any expertise in multi-specialty group practice? MR. MC BRIDE [Defendants' counsel]: If you have knowledge of that prior to the Ad Hoc Committee you can answer it. A. No. No knowledge prior to the Ad Hoc Committee. See Deposition of Milton Weiner, M.D., at 21 (Jan. 25, 1988) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. III, Ex. 55) (emphasis added). Although 
perhaps not free from doubt, this testimony suggests that Dr. Weiner does not know whether the other Board members had any 
expertise or not."
1293,15," In fact, as explained below, the Ad Hoc Board's conclusions regarding the criteria for multi-specialty group practice closely 
matched those of the BOME. "
1296,16," There appears to be no real dispute that this one-sentence description of Forest Medical's structure is accurate. See 
Defendants' Request for Admissions and Plaintiffs' Responses, Exhibits 1, 2, 6 (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 5); Transcript, at 92, 
96 (Oct. 6, 1986)."
1296,17," In fact, as set out in painstaking detail in the affidavit of Marvin Goldstein, Esq., a member of the Ad Hoc Board, the Board's 
hearings revealed considerable evidence that Forest Medical failed to meet these criteria, and a review of the underlying hearing 
transcripts demonstrates that Mr. Goldstein has not misrepresented the record before the Board. See Affidavit of Marvin M. 
Goldstein, Esq., at PP 11-20 (Mar. 13, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 2, Ex. 10) (""Goldstein Aff.""). Plaintiffs have pointed to no 
evidence in the record which contradicts these findings. "
1297,18, This refers to Dr. DeMauro. 
1298,19," It is unclear whether Dr. Bellavia meant that this study was used by both parties when the fee arrangements were negotiated 
or only that he was aware of this study when he negotiated the fee arrangements. Plaintiffs have not provided the court with a copy of this study, nor does it appear that they provided a copy to the Ad Hoc Board."
1298,20," According to Dr. Bellavia, Forest Medical is a professional corporation of which he is the sole stockholder.  Transcript, at 90 
(Oct. 6, 1986). A limited partnership called New Jersey Health Care Associates I was organized to provide the various goods 
and services (e.g., clerical services, advertising, medical supplies) for Forest Medical, and T.S.B. Health Management Corp. (a 
management company which is a general partner of New Jersey Health Care Associates I) managed Forest Medical. Id. at 119-
21, 141-42. Forest Medical was supposed to pay a fee for these services. However, according to Dr. Bellavia's testimony, at the 
time of the Ad Hoc Board's hearing in October 1986 Forest Medical had not paid anything. Id. at 140. "
1301,21," Plaintiffs direct much of their criticism at Dr. Bitsack, as opposed to his letter to the American College of Surgeons. Plaintiffs 
contend Dr. Bitsack: (1) did not know if the fee retained included use of the facility; (2) had no idea that Forest Medical was a 
multispecialty group practice; (3) acknowledged that there were other groups at HMC which broke down their bills in a similar 
fashion; and (4) had never functioned in a group practice. Actually, except for the last claim, the record support for these 
contentions is doubtful at best. More importantly, these criticisms are irrelevant to the merits of Dr. Bitsack's letter."
1301,22," On the other hand, Mr. Engleman decided against disclosing the report to the public, in view of the serious allegations 
contained therein, and with the (as it turns out futile) hope that he would thereby avoid inviting a defamation suit by plaintiffs. His 
concern with a possible defamation suit was not an idle one. Dr. Bellavia's attorney had already threatened Dr. Gardner with a 
lawsuit, apparently because Dr. Gardner had raised concerns about fee splitting by members of HMC's Department of Surgery. 
See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 34. Plaintiffs' response to Mr. Engleman's decision to not disclose the report (other than sending it to the BOME) is curious. On the 
one hand, plaintiffs have sued HMC for defamation based on the Ad Hoc Board's report, and presumably they would seek 
further damages for this claim had Mr. Engleman disseminated the report more broadly. On the other hand, plaintiffs appear to 
criticize Mr. Engleman for not distributing the report to the Medical Board, pointing out that on December 5, 1986 the Medical 
Board voted to disassociate itself from Mr. Engleman's decision to send the report to the BOME without first providing it to the 
Medical Board. See Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. I, Ex. 16. (Plaintiffs fail to mention that on December 9th, the Medical Board, acting 
on the advice of counsel, accepted the recommendation not to see the report at that time, and voted to desist pursuing the 
matter further. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 25.) "
1302,23," Ms. Dick denies this. She states that she never advised Mr. Napolitano or anyone else at HMC that the Ad Hoc Board should 
stop its investigation. In fact, Ms. Dick's recollection is that the Board had already issued its report by the time she was assigned 
to the case. Dick Aff., P 5."
1302,24," Based on testimony by Dr. Riccobono before the Ad Hoc Board and certain flyers allegedly posted in HMC's corridors, 
plaintiffs assert that ""hostility and [a] threatening atmosphere"" were present at HMC. See Plaintiffs' Br., at 30. Assuming 
arguendo that this assertion is true, plaintiffs have provided no evidence -- not even a conclusory allegation -- showing that the 
defendants contributed to this ""threatening atmosphere"" in any way. In fact, immediately after Dr. Riccobono complained of 
""threats"" to the Ad Hoc Board, he said that he accepted Dr. Jacobs' opinion that ""no innuendos, no accusations, no threats have 
come out of the workings of this Committee, nor are they attributed to anybody who's sitting in this room."" Transcript, at 211 
(Oct. 28, 1986). Indeed, Dr. Bellavia himself agreed that the Ad Hoc Board had not contributed to the harassment he felt he was "
1303,," experiencing, saying ""I know it's not your fault or the administration's fault or the hospital's fault."" Transcript, at 126 (Oct. 6, 
1986). "
1304,25," Dr. Bellavia does not even say who applied this ""pressure"" nor when these physicians resigned. "
1306,26," The BOME indicated that Dr. Bellavia had testified that he always told patients referred to Forest Medical that he was a part of 
Forest Medical. The BOME did not indicate whether it found that physicians affiliated with Forest Medical regularly saw patients 
there, or simply used it as a billing mechanism. Otherwise, the BOME indicated that Forest Medical Substantially failed to satisfy 
all the other criteria for a legitimate group practice."
1306,27," Prior to Mr. Napolitano's inquiry, in January 1986 Dr. Gardner, director of HMC's Department of General Surgery, sent to Dr. 
Gross a memo asking him to review Mr. Groover's case. The memo stated that when Mr. Groover's diagnosis was made, he 
was transferred to St. Michael's Medical Center, where he died. The memo added that ""no attempt was made to consult our 
cardiac team."" Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 12. See also Transcript, at 10 (Oct. 14, 1986). In response, because Mr. Groover 
was a patient of Heights Medical, Dr. Gross spoke with Dr. Robert Manzi, a physician associated with Heights Medical, the 
medical practice group which included Drs. Bellavia and Renner. Id. at 10-11. In February 1986 Dr. Gross sent Dr. Manzi a 
memo asking him to speak to Dr. Gardner about the case. Dr. Gross heard nothing further about the case from Dr. Gardner. Id. 
at 11. See also Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 13; Affidavit of Peter R. Gross, P 4 (Mar. 11, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 
2, Ex. 4). "
1307,28," Dr. Renner was (and is) a member of the Department of Internal Medicine at HMC. See Renner Aff., P 1."
1307,29," Aside from Dr. Gross and the persons called before the ARC as witnesses, six other physicians attended one or both of these 
meetings as members of the ARC. None of these six physicians is named as an antitrust defendant. "
1310,30," Dr. Charles Moss was among the physicians Dr. Gardner apparently spoke to during this time, although it appears from Dr. 
Gardner's contemporaneous memorandum to his file that they discussed other physicians, and not Dr. Moss' relation with Forest 
Medical. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 32. Dr. Moss, it will be recalled, is one of the physicians plaintiffs claim resigned 
from Forest Medical under ""pressure."" See supra at 44. In an affidavit submitted with this Court, Dr. Moss claims that sometime 
in 1985 (he does not specify the date) Dr. Gardner threatened him with a loss of privileges if he did not resign from Forest 
Medical. However, before the Ad Hoc Board Dr. Moss stated that he had resigned from Forest Medical in early February 1985 
after seeing only one patient, partly because Dr. Gardner was pressuring him to resign, ""but even more importantly"" because ""I 
was having real questions in my own mind as to the ethics of the relationship."" Transcript, at 72-75 (Oct. 16, 1986). "
1312,31," As previously noted, see supra at 44, in an affidavit submitted to this Court Dr. Cimmino contends that it was the October 7th 
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Department of Surgery, specifically, ""the pressure from the Department of Surgery, 
their decision to attempt to sanction me for unethical conduct and the innuendos propagated within the hospital environment,"" 
which caused him to resign from Forest Medical. Cimmino Aff., P 8. However, when he appeared before the Ad Hoc Board on 
October 2nd, he testified that he had already resigned from Forest Medical because if there was a ""cloud over what's been going 
on"" then ""I can't have that associated with my name."" Transcript, at 65 (Oct. 2, 1986). Dr. Cimmino gave essentially the same 
testimony when he appeared before the Executive Committee of the Department of Surgery. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, 
Ex. 58. "
1313,32," Dr. Cimmino apparently admits that he knowingly failed to disclose his affiliation with Forest Medical as required by the 
Department of Surgery's rule. See Cimmino Aff., P 4."
1313,33," Plaintiffs raised four other examples of what they claim is ""anti-competitive conduct."" First, they claim that in 1984 Dr. Bellavia 
was wrongfully denied reappointment as an attending physician in HMC's emergency room. This originally formed a separate 
claim in this action (Count II of the complaint); however, plaintiffs now concede that this claim should be dismissed. Second, 
plaintiffs allege that Dr. Bellavia has faced difficulty in getting credentials at HMC for physicians affiliated with him. Two 
physicians are identified, although it appears from plaintiffs' own admissions that each physician in fact received credentials at 
HMC. See Admissions, 59, 60. Third, plaintiffs allege that Dr. Nelson Walker convened an unprecedented hearing regarding a 
patient who died in the emergency room and that this was done to harass Dr. Bellavia, who was ultimately cleared. Finally, 
plaintiffs allege that Dr. Bellavia had difficulty getting routine procedures performed at HMC, such as OB/GYN consults. It is unnecessary to evaluate the merits of any of these allegations, however, for the simple reason that while plaintiffs describe 
this as ""anti-competitive conduct,"" they do not actually identify any of the antitrust defendants (other than HMC itself) as being 
responsible for any of the conduct of which they complain. Although plaintiffs' brief appears to suggest that Dr. Milton Weiner, 
who is an antitrust defendant, was somehow responsible for wrongfully denying Dr. Bellavia reappointment as an attending 
physician at HMC's emergency room, in fact, this appears to be a typographical error, because plaintiffs' own statement of 
undisputed facts and Dr. Bellavia's affidavit place the blame on Dr. Nelson Walker, who is not an antitrust defendant. Compare 
Plaintiffs' Br. at 40 with Plaintiffs' Undisputed Facts, P 76; Bellavia Aff., P 28."
1313,34," To make out a claim under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, plaintiffs must show (1) a substantive antitrust violation, (2) the fact of 
damage or injury, and (3) measurable damages. See American Bearing Co. v. Litton Industries, Inc., 729 F.2d 943, 948 (3d Cir.), 
cert. denied, 469 U.S. 854 (1984). Defendants contend that there is no substantive antitrust violation under either Section 1 or 2 
of the Sherman Act, that plaintiffs have not established antitrust injury, proximate cause or antitrust standing, and that plaintiffs' 
proof of damages is speculative. Defendants also contend that their conduct is entitled to immunity. Because I agree that 
plaintiffs cannot show a substantive antitrust violation under either Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, it is unnecessary to 
consider defendants' other contentions. "
1314,35," Although no longer a claim in this case, see supra note 4, to the extent plaintiffs contend that the emergency room contract 
which forms the basis for Count II of the complaint also constituted unfair competition, such contracts are also reviewed under 
the rule of reason standard. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 28-29 (1984); Collins v. 
Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 479-80 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852 (1988); Drs. Steuer & Latham, P.A. v. 
National Medical Enterprises, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 1489, 1503-04 (D.S.C. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 70 (4th Cir. 1988). "
1317,36," In his affidavit, plaintiffs' expert attempts to set forth certain allegations to support plaintiffs' theory of conspiracy. See Affidavit 
of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 20-25 (June 20, 1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. V). But in deposition plaintiffs' expert admitted he had no 
knowledge of any facts relevant to plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations. See Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 157-58 
(Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). "
1318,37," In an affidavit, Dr. Daniel Goodman also alleges that sometime in October 1986 Dr. Fioretti approached him to discuss Forest 
Medical, and he advised Dr. Goodman to be ""careful"" because there was an ongoing investigation of Forest Medical with regard 
to possible fee splitting. See Goodman Aff., P 4. Dr. Goodman has never suggested that he resigned from Forest Medical as a 
result of this conversation, or due to any other pressure from Dr. Fioretti. See supra at 42-43. In any case, this conversation 
does not appear to be part of the anticompetitive conduct of which plaintiffs complain. "
1319,38," In an attempt to cite some specific anticompetitive behavior by Dr. Fioretti, Dr. Bellavia alleged that Dr. Fioretti had spoken 
with Drs. DeMauro and Goodman about Forest Medical, and expressed the view that Forest Medical's fee arrangements were 
unethical. See Bellavia Dep., at 68. However, when pressed, Dr. Bellavia admitted that he did not think Dr. Fioretti was having 
these conversations for anticompetitive purposes, but instead ""he was giving them the benefit of his knowledge of what was 
going on,"" and ""was trying to be a good guy, say 'Look, Tom is in bad trouble.'"" Bellavia Dep., at 69; see also id. at 69-70."
1319,39," In an attempt to locate some kind of independent economic interest, plaintiffs allege that Dr. Weiner and Dr. Gardner gain 
some private benefit from the volume of cardiac surgery cases in which pump supervision is provided. Although plaintiffs' 
allegations in this respect are rather vague, apparently they refer to the Hackensack Cardiac Support Services, Inc. (""HCSS""). In 
addition to being an alleged source of private gain for Drs. Weiner and Gardner, plaintiffs contend that financial arrangements 
with the HCSS were somehow unethical. In each respect, plaintiffs' allegations are wholly unsupported and misguided. According to the records and documents submitted by both plaintiffs and defendants, HCSS is a non-profit New Jersey 
corporation created to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes. It appears that during 
certain types of heart surgery a ""pump,"" or heart-lung machine, is used, which is operated by specialists known as perfusionists. 
The perfusionists at HMC are not licensed in New Jersey, and therefore must be supervised by a licensed physician. With the 
HCSS, this supervising physician is paid a fee, which is then paid over into a fund managed by the HCSS for scientific, 
educational and charitable purposes. No individual receives any of these funds. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Exs. 7, 8; 
Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 31. Plaintiffs' contention that the operation of HCSS is somehow unethical finds no support in the record. In fact, plaintiffs' own 
submissions reveal that the proposal for the HCSS was investigated by the Medical Board and found to be ethical and legal. See 
Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Exs. 32-35; see also Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Ex. 9. More importantly, all evidence submitted demonstrates conclusively that no individual, let alone any named defendant, 
personally profits from the funds received and administered by the HCSS, and plaintiffs have submitted nothing to the contrary. 
Thus, plaintiffs' claim that pump supervision is a source of private economic gain for Dr. Weiner or Dr. Gardner is utterly 
baseless. As a final matter, plaintiffs contend that Dr. Weiner received fees from an HMC ""reading group"" which allegedly competed with 
Forest Medical for services such as EKG's. Aside from the fact that plaintiffs have made no showing of whether or to what extent 
Dr. Weiner competed with Forest Medical in this regard, this very argument was rejected by the court in Potters, supra, 800 F.2d 
at 573. The court in Potters reasoned that because a physician received fees from the hospital's use of EKG equipment did not 
give him a personal stake, because his interest lay solely in the overall success of the hospital. "
1321,40," Other efforts to probe Dr. Bellavia's knowledge of any evidence which would support the existence of a conspiracy similarly 
produced no results. For example, Dr. Bellavia alleged that Mr. Napolitano, the general counsel, warned him that ""the Hospital 
hierarchy was out to get me,"" but Mr. Napolitano did not actually identify any individual, let alone any named antitrust defendant. 
Bellavia Dep. (Vol. I), at 230, 232. Likewise, when this conversation allegedly took place, Dr. Bellavia denied that Mr. Napolitano 
said anything about Forest Medical or the other plaintiffs competing with HMC. Id. at 232-33. Dr. Bellavia likewise denied that 
Mr. Napolitano suggested that this alleged animosity had anything to do with the creation of the Ad Hoc Board. Id. at 234-35. Dr. Renner was similarly an unhelpful source of information about any alleged conspiracy. Thus, while he contended that the 
defendants made it ""extremely difficult"" for him to join the staff at HMC, Deposition of Carl J. Renner, at 45 (Mar. 8, 1988) 
(Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 6, Ex. 16) (""Renner Dep.""), he conceded that he could not identify whether any defendant participated 
in a conspiracy to keep him off the staff, he could not even identify a single person who asked an inappropriate question in 
connection with his application, and he ultimately agreed that he had no idea whether there was any such conspiracy at all. As 
for the Department of Internal Medicine investigation, Dr. Renner conceded that Dr. Gross as director of the Department had the 
authority to conduct the investigation and to recommend sanctions. Id. at 91. He also agreed that ""in part"" Dr. Gross acted in 
good faith and consistently with his role as director of the Department. While he further believed that Dr. Gross was getting 
""pressure"" to impose sanctions from ""different upper echelons of the institution,"" he conceded that he did not actually know 
whether any specific person was putting pressure on Dr. Gross. Id. at 95. Finally, plaintiffs apparently place great weight on the affidavit of former BOME investigator Darleen Schneider, but her 
allegations based on personal knowledge (as opposed to her speculations or conclusory allegations) actually amount to very 
little. For example, at one point she claims to have met with Drs. Gross, Weiner and Gardner who, she alleges, urged their belief 
that Forest Medical was engaged in fee splitting and unfair competition. See Affidavit of Darleen Schneider, P 11 (June 27, 
1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. II, Ex. 3). This hardly supports an inference that these physicians were engaged in an unlawful 
antitrust conspiracy, but rather suggests only that they believed that the Forest Medical fee arrangements were unethical. "
1323,41," Indeed, one of the logical obstacles to plaintiffs' case is that, on the one hand, they want to argue that individual defendants 
were competing with Forest Medical through their private practices, and thus had an independent economic interest sufficient to 
create an antitrust conspiracy, but on the other hand, they wish to contend that only Forest Medical and HMC competed in the 
MSGP market. "
1324,42," As explained below, plaintiffs' latest submission to the Court can only be interpreted as a complete abandonment of their 
expert's report. See infra at 116-17. There now appears to be no real dispute between the parties regarding the data for the 
cardiac surgery market; the only significant dispute is whether, as plaintiffs contend, that market should be limited to Bergen 
County residents."
1324,43," Dr. Seplaki has argued that HMC and Forest Medical were the only competitors in the cardiac surgery market, see Affidavit of 
Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 60-62, 66-67 (June 20, 1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. V), but this assertion is simply absurd (unless one "
1325,," resorts to tautology by excluding from the market any Bergen County resident who obtains surgery via any location other than 
HMC and Forest Medical). Every data source, including those upon which Dr. Seplaki allegedly relied, shows that Bergen 
County residents regularly obtain cardiac surgery at hospitals outside Bergen County. Indeed, the contention that only HMC and 
Forest Medical compete for cardiac surgery patients is flatly illogical. Plaintiffs' entire case hinges on their belief that Forest 
Medical competed with HMC in the cardiac surgery market. Yet, no cardiac surgery was ever performed at Forest Medical. 
Instead, Forest Medical referred patients for cardiac surgery to be performed elsewhere, i.e., at hospitals outside Bergen 
County, such as St. Michael's. It is incomprehensible to argue, as Dr. Seplaki does, that Forest Medical competes with HMC 
when it refers a Bergen County resident for surgery at St. Michael's, but that St. Michael's does not compete with HMC if the 
same Bergen County resident goes to St. Michael's without the aid of a Forest Medical referral."
1325,44," Dr. Seplaki has made a multi-volume submission to this Court, but for our purposes it is largely immaterial. First, Dr. Seplaki 
has submitted a lengthy affidavit. See Affidavit of Les Seplaki, Ph.D. (June 20, 1991) (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. V) (""Seplaki Aff.""). 
However, Dr. Seplaki's affidavit is largely spent on two irrelevant subjects: (1) damages, a question I need not reach, because I 
find there is no valid antitrust claim, and (2) a vituperative, ad hominem attack on defendants' expert, which neither undermines 
defendants' expert's analysis, nor bolsters Dr. Seplaki's analysis. With respect to the latter aspect of Dr. Seplaki's affidavit, for 
example, he contends at length that defendants' expert somehow used inappropriate methods for gathering data for his market 
analysis. However, Dr. Seplaki never actually alleges that the data used by defendants' expert are in any way defective. In fact, 
as described more fully below, the market analysis produces substantially similar results if one uses the data upon which Dr. 
Seplaki allegedly relied. Also submitted with Dr. Seplaki's affidavit are several exhibits. Again, however, they largely pertain to damages. Of the relevant 
exhibits, there is a brief market analysis which is only fourteen pages long, and which includes no analysis, gives no explanation 
of its methodology, and cites no data sources. See Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. VI, Ex. 2. Finally, ten exhibits consist of tables which 
purportedly present HMC's market share for various localities in New Jersey. Again, Dr. Seplaki provides no data source and no 
explanation of how he derived these market shares. See Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. VI, Exs. 8-17. The numbers derived in these 
tables do not correspond to the numbers presented in Dr. Seplaki's market share report."
1325,45," At a deposition, Dr. Seplaki conceded that his product definition of the cardiac surgery market matched the product line for 
cardiac cases listed in the market share reports of the New Jersey Hospital Association. See Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 
113 (Dec. 10, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). According to the NJHA reports, this product line for cardiac surgery is 
defined by the diagnostic related groups (""DRGs""), numbers 103 through 109. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 91, at 9. For 
a definition of these DRGs, see Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 100. "
1326,46," This method of averaging the unweighted shares is apparent from the set of tables included with Dr. Seplaki's affidavit. See 
Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. VI, Exs. 8-17."
1326,47," Dr. Seplaki also erred in substantially overestimating the number of cardiac surgery patients referred by Forest Medical during 
its existence. While he conceded he was unsure of the precise number, he guessed that it ranged from 70 to 100. See 
Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 95-96 (June 26, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). In fact, from the discovery 
obtained by defendants, during the relevant period the cardiac surgery group handled about 32 cardiac patients referred from 
Forest Medical or Heights Medical, 16 of whom were cardiac surgery patients. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 114, at 2 
n.4; see also Admissions, 28; Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 106. This is similar to the figure cited by Dr. Syracuse during the 
Ad Hoc Board hearings. See Transcript, at 41 (Oct. 1, 1986). "
1327,48," The following critique of Dr. Seplaki's manipulation of the New Jersey data is derived from a comparison (on a town by town 
basis) of the NJHA market share reports, upon which Dr. Seplaki allegedly relied, and the tables Dr. Seplaki prepared which are 
supposed to show HMC's market share in each of the towns in the relevant markets. Compare Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Exs. 
91-92, with Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. VI, Exs. 8-17."
1327,49," For 1986, this error inflated Dr. Seplaki's calculation of HMC's market shares in: (1) the towns of Garfield, Little Ferry, Lodi, 
Maywood, Moonachie, Rochelle Park, Saddle Brook and Woodridge, in the so-called primary market; (2) the towns of Palisade's 
Park and Ridgefield, in the so-called secondary market; and (3) the towns of Harrington Park, Hillsdale, Northvale, Ramsey, 
Saddle River and Waldwick, in the so-called tertiary market. For 1987, this inflated his calculation of HMC's market shares in: (1) 
Hackensack, Hasbrouck Heights, Maywood, Moonachie, Ridgefield Park, Rochelle Park, Saddle Brook and Woodridge, in the 
so-called primary market; (2) Cliffside Park, Dumont, Elmwood Park, Englewood, Fairview, Fort Lee, Leonia, and Ridgefield, in 
the so-called secondary market; and (3) Closter, Creskill, Emerson, Glen Rock, Haworth, Hillsdale, Hohokus, Mahwah, Midland 
Park, Montvale, Northvale, Norwood, Oakland, Ramsey, Ridgewood, Rivervale, Tenafly, Upper Saddle River and Washington in 
the so-called tertiary market."
1327,50," As already explained, the market for cardiac surgery, as defined by Dr. Seplaki, included DRGs 103 through 109. For DRGs 
104 to 108, the procedure involves a ""pump"" or heart-lung machine, which a hospital must be licensed to use. Dr. Seplaki 
apparently assumed that a hospital not so licensed could not perform cardiac surgery. However, DRG 109 does not involve a 
""pump"" and therefore does not require such a license. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 114, at 16-17 & nn. 34-35; see also 
Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 100."
1327,51," For 1986, this error inflated Dr. Seplaki's calculation of HMC's market share in: (1) Garfield, Lodi, Oradell and Paramus, in the 
so-called primary market; (2) Cliffside Park, Elmwood Park, Fairview and Palisade's Park, in the so-called secondary market; 
and (3) Englewood Cliffs, Northvale, Parkridge, Ridgewood, Saddle River, Tenafly and Westwood, in the so-called tertiary 
market. For 1987, this error inflated Dr. Seplaki's estimate of HMC's market share in: (1) Bogota, Lodi, New Milford, Ridgefield 
Park and Saddle Brook, for the so-called primary market; (2) Cliffside Park, Dumont, Fair Lawn, and Fort Lee, in the so-called 
secondary market; and (3) Creskill, Emerson, Ramsey and Westwood in the so-called tertiary market. "
1328,52," For Moonachie in 1986, after manipulating the data by dropping the figure for ""other"" New Jersey hospitals, Dr. Seplaki 
mistakenly used the figure for the General Hospital at Passiac to calculate HMC's market share, with the end result that HMC's 
share leapt from 25% (as reported by NJHA) to 67% (as given by Dr. Seplaki). Dr. Seplaki likewise used the ""other"" figure for 
Allendale in 1987 to calculate HMC's share, thus increasing its share from 0% to 100%. He achieved the same result in 
Englewood Cliffs in 1987, by giving HMC the figure for Englewood Hospital. After manipulating the data to eliminate the figure for 
""other"" hospitals for Oakland in 1987, Dr. Seplaki made an arithmatic error, thus increasing HMC's share from the 23% NJHA 
value to Dr. Seplaki's 33% share."
1328,53," I should note that HMC's alleged market shares in its so-called primary, secondary and tertiary markets, as set forth in 
conclusory fashion in Dr. Seplaki's expert report, do not correspond in any way to the market shares he presents in exhibits 8-17 
to his affidavit, either with or without the putative New York ""double dip."" Compare Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. VI, Ex. 2, with Exs. 8-
17. For a normal expert, one would expect this discrepancy to engender some kind of explanation, but with Dr. Seplaki it comes 
as no surprise that he ignores it entirely. Dr. Seplaki has never provided either the method of determining the market shares 
presented in his report, nor has he presented the underlying data, so we are left to guess at how he arrived at these figures. 
(Like the numbers set forth in Exhibits 8-17, Dr. Seplaki's expert report only provides market shares for 1986 and 1987, and not 
for any other year.) In any case, to the extent we can determine how Dr. Seplaki made his calculations, as from his exhibits 8-17, 
his study is completely flawed. "
1329,54," The discrepancy between the two analyses appears to turn on the data used. Starting with 1986, for cardiac surgeries 
performed in New Jersey, both analyses purport to use the same NJHA data, but defendants found slightly more cardiac 
surgeries overall, and thus found a slightly lower market share for HMC. Compare Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 94, with 
Plaintiffs' Letter Br., Ex. A. My own review actually indicates that defendants' data match perfectly with the NJHA data, see 
Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 91 (final table showing all surgeries for Bergen County residents), but I assume arguendo that 
plaintiffs' data are more accurate. In any case, the more significant discrepancy concerns the New York data. Specifically, 
defendants claim to have found 160 additional Bergen County residents who obtained cardiac surgery in New York, thus 
lowering their calculation of HMC's market share. Again, I assume arguendo that plaintiffs are correct when they say their data 
are more accurate. See Plaintiffs' Letter Br., at 2. As for 1987, there is a larger discrepancy in the underlying data used. This time plaintiffs' data appear to reflect accurately the 
NJHA data, while defendants have used a different data source for New Jersey, which they deem to be more accurate. The 
parties also diverge again on their New York data. Despite these discrepancies, the result (that is, HMC's market share) is nearly 
identical in each case, because while plaintiffs' data state a lower number of cardiac surgeries overall, they also give a lower 
number of surgeries performed by HMC. Again, I assume arguendo that plaintiffs' data are more accurate."
1329,55," As discussed at length above, plaintiffs cannot as a matter of law show that any conspiracy to restrain or monopolize trade 
existed. See supra at 79-96. Thus, the failure to present a viable market analysis presents a second reason for rejecting 
plaintiffs' Section 1 claim. "
1330,56," Moreover, plaintiffs' own expert conceded during deposition that an increase in HMC's market share would not necessarily be 
attributable to the demise of Forest Medical. See Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 67-68 (June 26, 1990) (Defendants' 
Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3)."
1330,57," In fact, plaintiffs have admitted that there is no reason why patients and physicians in Bergen County could not continue to 
obtain cardiac surgery from the same group of surgeons who were affiliated with Forest Medical, and who continued their 
practice despite Forest Medical's demise. See Admissions, 11, 12. Indeed, when he appeared before the Ad Hoc Board, Dr. 
Bellavia stated that he continued to refer patients to this group of cardiac surgeons, despite the fact that they had terminated 
their relation with Forest Medical. See Transcript, at 147 (Oct. 6, 1986); see also Deposition of Thomas S. Bellavia, M.D. (Vol. 
V), at 147-49 (Feb. 1, 1991) (Defendants' Letter Br., Ex. C). Similarly, plaintiffs' expert admitted during deposition that if referrals 
continued to be made to the surgical group after Forest Medical's demise there would be no lessening of competition, and he 
conceded that he had no idea whether or not referrals were disrupted by Forest Medical's absence. See Deposition of Les 
Seplaki, Ph.D., at 163, 174-75, 177 (June 25, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). Part of this problem derived from the 
fact that plaintiffs' expert had no idea what portion of the cardiac referrals came from Forest Medical, and what portion came 
from Heights Medical, which continues to operate. See Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 95-97 (June 26, 1990) (Defendants' 
Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). In fact, plaintiffs have apparently admitted that most cardiac referrals during the relevant period came 
from Heights Medical, not Forest Medical. See Admissions, 26-29."
1330,58," Although not mentioned in their most recent submission, on occasion plaintiffs have also alleged barriers to entry in the 
cardiac surgery market, as a justification for submitting their monopolization claim without a sufficient showing of market power. 
But plaintiffs have submitted no evidence to support their contention that such barriers to entry exist. In his expert report, Dr. Seplaki asserted (albeit without citing any support) that these barriers to entry consisted of ""regulatory 
constraints"" and ""major financial obstacles."" Plaintiffs Exhibits, Vol. VI, Ex. 2, at 9. Plaintiffs have only identified two ""regulatory 
constraints."" First, in deposition Dr. Seplaki contended that the necessity of becoming licensed to practice medicine was ""the 
main regulatory barrier."" Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 153 (June 26, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). But Dr. 
Seplaki acknowledged that he knew of no instance where a physician sought to join Forest Medical prior to having his own 
license, and he admitted that this so-called ""barrier"" was no different than the requirement faced by all physicians. Id. Plaintiffs 
also contend that the requirement of obtaining a certificate-of-need (""CON"") to provide cardiac surgery placed a major barrier to 
entry in the cardiac surgery market. However, as defendants' expert has pointed out, CON regulations apply only to licensed 
health care facilities (like HMC), and a private practice like Forest Medical is not subject to CON requirements. See Affidavit of 
David M. Eisenstadt, Ph.D., at 16-17 (May 29, 1991) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 2, Ex. 16) (""Eisenstadt Aff.""). As for financial barriers to entry, Dr. Seplaki alleged that the start-up costs of a practice like Forest Medical were ""in the vicinity 
of a million bucks."" Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 154 (June 26, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). However, at 
another point in his deposition, Dr. Seplaki admitted that his information about the start-up costs came from Dr. Bellavia, and Dr. 
Seplaki had no independent knowledge of this. Id. at 79-80. In fact, in his affidavit, Dr. Bellavia only provided the conclusory 
allegation that equipment for Forest Medical cost approximately one-tenth of Dr. Seplaki's estimate ($ 100,000), and did not 
otherwise specify any start-up costs. Moreover, as defendants' expert has pointed out, given Dr. Seplaki's profit projections for 
Forest Medical, ""physicians would line up to invest in similar such ventures, and therefore the alleged capital barriers cannot be 
significant."" Eisenstadt Aff., at 17-18. "
1331,59," As explained previously, because only 16 cardiac surgery cases were referred during Forest Medical's existence (often by 
Heights Medical), the elimination of Forest Medical could at most return only 1% of the cardiac surgery market to HMC. See 
supra at 118."
1331,60," In his deposition, Dr. Seplaki explained that the sole basis for his definition of the geographic market for cardiac surgery was 
that evidence indicated that a majority of all hospital admissions to HMC (most of which were not for cardiac surgery) originated 
in Bergen County. See Deposition of Les Seplaki, Ph.D., at 179-81 (June 25, 1990) (Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 4, Ex. 3). When 
pressed to identify the source of this information, he could only name a study prepared for HMC by the firm of Deloitte Haskins & 
Sells, which analyzed HMC's service demand for all medical care (not just cardiac surgery), and unspecified certificate-of-need 
applications HMC had filed. See id. at 117, 171. See also Seplaki Aff., at 58-59. The Deloitte, Haskins & Sells study indicates 
that roughly 75% of all hospital admissions to HMC come from a service area in Bergen County. See Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 
1, Ex. 102, at 12. Similarly, a certificate-of-need application prepared by HMC in March 1985 defined HMC's service area for all 
hospital admissions to include Bergen County and eight counties in Passaic and Hudson Counties. The application went on to 
define a ""primary"" service area in Bergen County where, it said, 70% of all of HMC's hospital admissions originated. See 
Defendants' Exhibits, Vol. 1, Ex. 90."
1331,61," In fact, HMC's President John Ferguson testified in deposition that HMC was actively competing for cardiac surgery patients 
not only in New York and New Jersey, but in other states as well, and even internationally. See Deposition of John P. Ferguson, 
at 2-4 (Plaintiffs' Exhibits, Vol. III, Ex. 84). "
1332,62," As described above, see supra at 109, based on Dr. Seplaki's view that Forest Medical was a ""significant"" competitor for 
HMC, 15 other hospitals in New York and New Jersey would also provide ""significant"" competition in the cardiac surgery market."
1332,63," I should emphasize that with respect to the foregoing I do not adopt any view regarding the appropriate geographic definition 
of the market for cardiac surgery. Rather, it is plaintiffs' burden to come forward with evidence supporting an appropriate market 
definition, and this plaintiffs have failed to do, because they have erroneously relied on the scope of the service area for all 
hospital admissions to HMC, to define the market for cardiac surgery in which HMC competes. The foregoing examples are 
simply used to illustrate that when one selects a geographic area in which HMC plausibly competes (i.e., residents would 
consider HMC and other hospitals as representing reasonable competitive alternatives for cardiac surgery), HMC's market share 
consistently falls below 20%. Plaintiffs simply have submitted no market analysis whatsoever to counter this conclusion. "
1339,1," Actually, plaintiff purports to appeal from the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and an order granting 
defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(1). Neither of these orders is 
appealable; appeal must be taken from the ensuing order (judgment) of dismissal. ( Code Civ. Proc., §§ 581d, 904.1; Yancey v. "
1340,," Fink (1991) 226 Cal. App.3d 1334, 1342 [277 Cal.Rptr. 415]; Adohr Milk Farms, Inc. v. Love (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 366, 369 [63 
Cal.Rptr. 123].) A judgment of dismissal was entered before the notice of appeal was filed. Construing the notice of appeal 
liberally in favor of its sufficiency (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1(a)), we interpret it to apply to the appealable judgment rather than 
the nonappealable orders. (See Vibert v. Berger (1966) 64 Cal.2d 65, 67-68 [48 Cal.Rptr. 886, 410 P.2d 390]; Luz v. Lopes 
(1960) 55 Cal.2d 54, 59-60 [10 Cal.Rptr. 161, 358 P.2d 289].) "
1341,2," Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction was denied. In this court plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate directing 
respondent court to grant the motion or for writ of supersedeas enjoining real parties in interest from enforcing Plan B against 
plaintiff during the 1990 football season. The petition was denied. "
1343,3," HN6[
] California Constitution, article I, section 1 reads: ""All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property and pursuing and 
obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy."" The right to work, either in employment or independent business, is protected by this 
provision. ( Bautista v. Jones (1944) 25 Cal.2d 746, 749 [155 P.2d 343].) HN7[
]  Business and Professions Code section 16600 provides: ""Except as provided in this chapter [chapter 1, Contracts 
in Restraint of Trade], every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of 
any kind is to that extent void."""
1343,4," Plaintiff argues that the state laws sought to be enforced in this action, and challenged as unconstitutional, embody not mere 
economic regulation but rather the fundamental right to work guaranteed by California to its residents; accordingly, the result of 
the balancing test performed by the court in Partee is inapplicable here. We do not agree. This action does not advance the "
1344,," compelling state interest of promoting the health or safety of its citizens. (See Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 
supra, 434 U.S. 429, 443 [54 L.Ed.2d 664, 676].) Under the facts alleged plaintiff seeks to advance his economic interest by 
obtaining ""a competitive market value"" for his services. While that interest may be legitimate, it is less compelling than 
California's interest in enforcing its antitrust laws. ( City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 414, 421-422 [220 
Cal.Rptr. 153].) "
1353,1," The sale of telecommunications services by Mobile Communications is regulated by the FCC and by some states; however, 
the sale of products by Mobile Communications is not regulated. P 13."
1353,2," The individual defendants named in the complaint are: Delbert C. Staley, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief 
Executive Officer of NYNEX until June 1, 1989 (P 17); William C. Ferguson, Chief Executive Officer of NYNEX since June 1, 
1989, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of NYNEX since October 1, 1989 (P 18); William G. Burns, Vice Chairman of the 
Board of Directors of NYNEX until December 31, 1989 (P 19); Peter L. Haynes, president of MECO (P 20); Paul C. O'Brien, 
President of NETel (P 21); Frederick Salerno, President of NYTel (P 22); Paul D. Covill, President of NYNEX Service (P 23). The 
complaint also refers to ""other persons currently unknown to plaintiffs, including other executives, managers and members of 
NYNEX's and its subsidiaries' boards of directors"" who may be named as defendants once their identities become known to 
plaintiffs (P 24)."
1353,3," The ""State Public Utilities Agencies"" refers to the Public Utilities Commissions of the States of Maine, New Hampshire and 
Rhode Island, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities and Public Utilities Commission, the Vermont Public Service 
Board, the Connecticut Department of Public Utilities Control, and the New York Public Service Commission. P 25. "
1354,4," Reference will be made infra to LILCO I, a prior case entitled County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting, Co., which is reported 
at 728 F.2d 52 (2d Cir. 1984). "
1360,5," Wire fraud allegations must meet the same pleading requirements as mail fraud allegations. The Limited, Inc. v. McCrory 
Corp., 645 F.Supp. 1038, 1047 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). See Shaw v. Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc., 726 F.Supp. 969, 971 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 
1989). "
1362,6," While the complaint thus alleges three enterprises under Section 1962(c) in P 67, it can be read to allege, at the same time, a 
single enterprise. For example, P 64 of the complaint realleges and incorporates by reference PP 1-63. At P 56 of the complaint, 
where plaintiffs allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), the enterprise is defined as ""the combination of NYNEX and its 
regulated and unregulated Subsidiaries which are and have been involved in overcharging NYTel and NETel and, as a result, 
intentionally overbilling customers of NYTel and NETel, including plaintiffs and the Class."" At P 56(a), the complaint specifies 
that ""the enterprise consists of NYNEX, NYTel, NETel, BISC, Information Solutions, NYNEX Credit, NYNEX International, 
MECO, Mobile, NYNEX Properties, NYNEX service and NSM."" In either event, the complaint meets the enterprise requirement 
of the RICO statute. See Connors v. Lexington Ins. Co., 666 F.Supp. 434, 448-449 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). "
1365,7," Plaintiffs do not dispute defendants' claim that, under IVY Broadcasting Co. Inc. v. AT&T, 391 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1968) and 
Nordlicht v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 799 F.2d 859 (2d Cir. 1986), this claim must be limited to allegations concerning the PSC and cannot 
extend to claims involving the FCC. "
1366,8," a plaintiffs rely, for their common law claims, on the law of New York. See plaintiffs' Consolidated Memorandum of Law in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at pp. 76-77. "
1370,1," Bartholemew v. CNG Producing Co., 832 F.2d 326, 330 (5th cir. 1987). "
1376,1," Two salons indicated in the chart are outside the metropolitan area and are included in these figures because they cannot be 
separated. They both overlap into the metropolitan market and charge $ 8.00. "
1378,2," Further, if Penco could demonstrate that prices are being fixed, it still may not be entitled to relief. Penco would need to 
demonstrate an injury by showing that it was forced to lower its prices to $ 8.00. Raising its prices to $ 9.00 from the present $ 
8.95 would not create an injury but a benefit, thus precluding, at least, monetary relief. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum 
Co., 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990). "
1379,3," Penco's argument that price-fixing is evident by the number of Great Clips franchises in the Twin Cities market which charge 
the same price is without adequate support. While such evidence may raise the possibility of diminished intrabrand competition, 
""more than a showing that the [franchisee] conformed to the suggested price"" is required. Monsanto Corp. v. Spray-rite Serv. 
Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764 n.9 (1984)."
1379,4," The issue of the relevant market is not seriously contested as to geography, however, the parties dispute the relative market 
as far as which types of salons comprise the competition. Even accepting Penco's assertion that the relevant market is limited to 
discount hair care providers, which the Court does not, Great Clips would not have a market share approaching 50-60%. "
1380,5," Some commentators have argued that purely vertical restrictions on intrabrand competition, both non-price and price, should 
be illegal per se. Posner, The Next Step in the Antitrust Treatment of Restricted Distribution: Per Se Legality, 48 U.Chic.L.Rev. 
6, 25 (1981); Bork, Vertical Restraints: Schwinn Overruled, 1977 Sup.Ct.Rev. 171, 190-92. Such is not the law now, however. "
1388,1," Defendant Colombi was employed by Plaintiff from June of 1983 to November of 1985. Defendant Colombi began as a 
secretary and was promoted to general manager. In October or November of 1990, Defendant Colombi left Plaintiff's employ and 
began working at Soltron. "
1389,2," Apparently Defendant Colombi kept a file at her home of telexes that were not addressed to her, including communications 
between Plaintiff's attorney and Plaintiff's vice president. These telexes related to Defendant JK's activities. "
1392,3," Defendant JK contends that McAngus's testimony is hearsay and, thus, inadmissible. Udo Sommerkamp is a resident of 
Germany and has not yet been deposed. Magistrate Judge P. Michael Mahoney has ordered that Defendant JK produce 
Sommerkamp for deposition thirty days before trial in this matter. As such, the court does not find it to be improper to consider 
McAngus's testimony in this regard for purposes of this motion for summary judgment. McAngus's testimony, at the very least, 
raises a genuine issue of material fact, thereby, precluding summary judgment. "
1393,4," Illinois courts have stated that ""malice"", in this context, means only an intent to interfere without sufficient justification. Malice, 
in this context, does not require a showing of ill will, hostility or an intent to injure. Getschow v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 444 
N.E.2d 579, 584, (1st Dist. 1982). "
1395,5," Furthermore, in Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 547 n.21 (7th Cir. 1986), the Seventh Circuit held that the boycott 
activity of the defendants in that case was in violation of the antitrust law and, therefore, eliminated the competitors' privilege for 
purposes of ruling on the plaintiff's State law claim of interference with prospective business advantage. Because this court has 
ruled that Plaintiff's Sherman Act claims survive summary judgment, the court must also rule, in line with Fishman, that any 
alleged competitors' privilege on the part of Defendant JK must be eliminated from the determination as to summary judgment in 
regard to Count III of the amended complaint. "
1397,1," Jurisdiction is also properly invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Plaintiff is a New York corporation with its principal place of 
business in New York City. Defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Akron, Ohio. Compl. 
paras. 5, 7, 8. "
1398,2, See e.g. Plaintiff's Exh. on Opposition.
1398,3," Sometime in the early 1980's procurement responsibility for the BSU-49 was assigned to the Army Armament Munitions and 
Chemical Command. For ease of reference, we refer to this governmental unit as ""the Army"" for the remainder of our discussion."
1398,4," The other two ballute subcontractors were Raven Industries, Inc. and Carolina Parachute Corporation. "
1399,5," To qualify as a contractor for the BSU-49 a company must be designated as a ""mobilization base"" producer by the 
Government, see 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(16)(1984), and pass stringent site survey requirements and environmental and flight 
tests. See Compl. paras. 14-16."
1399,6," Irvin Industries v. United States of America, et al. (Civ. Action No. 85-0206) (filed January 18, 1985). The complaint in this 
action alleged, inter alia, that the Government unlawfully exercised the option in GAC's 1984 contract by failing to evaluate 
alternative competitive sources in the procurement of the BSU-49, in violation of 10 U.S.C. § 2340(g)(1984). See Compl. para. 
53."
1399,7," In 1984 Congress passed the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, 10 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq., which superseded provisions 
of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, formerly codified at 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(16)(1984). The new law requires that 
government contract procurements be submitted to ""full and open competition"" -- whether by sealed bidding or other competitive 
procedures -- except under six enumerated circumstances. The new law, however, does not cover the BSU-49 contracts, as 
mobilization base programs are included in one of the enumerated exceptions. See 10 U.S.C. § 2304(c)(3)(1990)."
1399,8," Evidence of these allegedly defamatory statements comes from the deposition testimony of a government contracting officer, 
Mr. Bronson, taken by plaintiff in its suit Irvin Industries v. United States of America, et al. (Civ. Action No. 85-0206), see supra n. 
6. Plaintiff advises us that Mr. Bronson died before he could be deposed in this action. See Pl. Mem. at 28. As defendant was 
not a party to that litigation, it is doubtful whether this deposition testimony would here be admissible. However, for present 
purposes we assume it to be true. "
1400,9," Although Lanson's quote to plaintiff was for a lower number of units, namely 18,000 tailcones as compared with its proposed 
contract with defendant for 62,628 tailcones, for purposes of this motion we assume the contracts were identical."
1400,10," The Army's solicitation informed that it sought a contract to supply 62,628 ballutes in 1987, with an option to supply 125,256 
units in 1988 and 1989. Regardless of the amount of the 1988-89 option bid, according to the terms of the solicitation the Army 
was required to accept the lowest single year bid. Compl. para. 79."
1400,11," Although not material to our discussion, a brief explanation of the relevant pricing terminology may be helpful here. ""Variable 
costs"" are those which fluctuate with a firm's output, and typically include such costs as materials, fuel, and labor. In contrast, 
""fixed costs"" are those which are independent of output, e.g. management expenses, irreducible overhead. An estimate of ""total 
costs"" represents the sum of both fixed and variable costs. The sum of all variable costs divided by output yields average 
variable costs. Prices below average variable costs are presumed to be predatory and in violation of the antitrust laws. See 
Northeastern Tel. Co. v. A.T.&T. (2d Cir. 1981) 651 F.2d 76, 86."
1400,12," In July 1987 plaintiff filed a separate action against this defendant, alleging, inter alia, that the information which defendant 
submitted to the Army concerning its costs for the BSU-49 in the years 1982 through 1985 was false. United States of America, 
ex rel. Irvin Industries, Inc. v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp. 87 Civ. 4444. This False Claims Act suit is still pending. "
1401,13," See Pl. Mem. at 52, 124."
1401,14," Both parties in their briefs speculate as to whether plaintiff's bid was premised on ""greed"" or only a desire to make a 
reasonable profit. Such speculation is wholly immaterial. If, on the one hand, plaintiff's bid was greedily arrived at or, on the other 
hand, was the lowest possible bid it could have made without itself becoming predatory, the fact remains that the predatory 
quality of defendant's bid had absolutely no causal relation to the rejection of plaintiff's. "
1402,15, The record is also devoid of any evidence that any company refused to do business with plaintiff. 
1404,16," In its brief in opposition, plaintiff informs that it no longer relies on its claim of prima facie tort. "
