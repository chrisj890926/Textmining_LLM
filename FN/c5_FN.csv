25,1," As Earl Kintner has explained: Coercion is the use of market leverage to force upon consumers items they would not otherwise have purchased. Since it is this 
exploitation of economic power that concerns the courts, coercion is an implicit requirement for an unlawful tie-in agreement. 
Traditionally, coercion has been inferred from the seller's economic power in the tying market. However, some courts, especially 
in private treble-damage suits, will not find an illegal tie-in unless the buyer is shown to have actually been compelled to 
purchase the tied product. A growing trend is to require a strict individual demonstration of coercion."

26,2," Since the dismissal of plaintiff's antitrust count as to defendants is based solely on the insufficiency of plaintiff's allegations of 
an antitrust violation, I make no determination about the other arguments raised in defendants' motion. See, e.g., Motion of

34,1," Under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051 et seq., once a trademarks' comes incontestable, the registration is ""conclusive 
evidence of the .. . exclusive rights to use the registered mark . . . in connection with [specified] goods or services"" subject to 
seven enumerated defenses.  15 U.S.C. § 1115(b). Among the defenses that an alleged infringer may raise are violation of the 
antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(7), see infra at 7-9, or that the trademark is generic or a common descriptive name. See infra 
at 9-10. Proof of a defense to inconstestability extinguishes the presumption of exclusivity to use the registered mark. See 
generally Park ' N Fly Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc.,     U.S.    , 105 S.Ct. 658 (1985). ""The registration is merely downgraded 
from 'conclusive' to ""prima facie evidence."" J. Gilson, Trademark Protect & Practice § 4.03[3] at 4-24.8. That is, there is a

36,2," The gist of Kar-Rite's §§ 1 and 2 claims against the patent are contained in § § 49 and 65 of Counterclaim Two. Paragraph 49 
of Counterclaim One, realleged in § 64 of Counterclaim Two, alleges the plaintiff has ""unclean hands"" because it is ""enforcing 
what it knows to be an invalid patent, [and] is in violation of the Anti Trust sic laws of the United States and the Anti Trust [sic] 
laws of the State of Illinois."" In § 65, Kar-Rite states that its air current deflector does not infringe plaintiffs patent and that: plaintiff's accusations of alleged infringement have been recklessly made, and plaintiff's demands that defendant cease and 
desist from making and selling its air current deflector shield under the threat of litigation and enforcement of [plaintiff's patent] 
was, and is, an overt act of unfair competition and an intentional attempt to unreasonably restrain trade in interstate commerce 
and unlawfully injure a competitor by wrongfully asserting a patent that is invalid, unenforceable and non-infringed."
36,3," In its memorandum Kar-Rite raises a new allegation regarding its contention that plaintiff's enforcement of its trademark rights 
violates § 2 of the Sherman Act. Kar-Rite argues that, because plaintiff has sued three of eight ""competitors"" for trademark 
infringement, this is evidence of its attempt to monopolize ""the market."" See Defendant's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs

Cir. 1976) and Lehigh v. The Pittston Co., 456 A. 2d 355 (Me. 1983). Notwithstanding that the court in Niswonger denied a 
motion to dismiss a claim made under § 1349(a), that case is not strong support for Interface's position because the district court 
simply ruled that a complaint for a declaration voiding a lease which allegedly violated § 1349 stated a cognizable claim, not that 
Congress intended to create a private right of action under § 1349. Moreover, the district court's opinion was rendered before the 
Supreme Court's decision in Cort v. Ash.  Lehigh is also inapposite because, like the district court in Niswonger, the Supreme 
Court of Maine did not address the question whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action under § 1349. "

80,1," Both parties engage in a lengthy discussion about the applicability of Garcia v. San Antonio Municipal Transit Authority, 469 
U.S. 528, 83 L. Ed. 2d 1016, 105 S. Ct. 1005 (1985) to this case. There, the Supreme Court held that the overtime and minimum 
wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Acts (""FLSA"") applied to employees of a municipally-owned transportation 
system. The court reasoned that applying the FLSA to municipal employees contravened no affirmative limit on Congress' power 
under the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. In so holding, the court discarded the concept of ""governmental"" 
versus ""proprietary"" function as a criterion for characterizing actions of a local public agency for purposes of applying the FLSA. Plaintiff argues that because state action immunity is not based on constitutional interpretation, the Garcia case does not apply 
to it. ""The 'proprietary/governmental' distinction remains viable when applying the antitrust laws to the cities."" Plaintiff's response, 
page 15. Thus, plaintiff's argument goes, defendant's activities were ""proprietary"" rather than ""governmental"" and not subject to 
immunity from the antitrust laws. Defendant, on the other hand, contends that Garcia is applicable as reflecting the intent of Congress in enacting the Sherman 
Act under the Commerce Clause. See Defendant's Reply Brief, page 9. In other words, the Supreme Court in Garcia expressed 
a rationale as to when any legislation enacted under the Commerce Clause is constitutionally applicable to a municipality. 
Because Congress enacted the Sherman Act pursuant to its power to regulate interstate commerce, Garcia applies here, and 
eliminates any distinction between proprietary and governmental function regarding the state action immunity doctrine. The court believes that Garcia simply does not affect this case. The test for establishing state action immunity is thoroughly laid 
out in Hallie and the above-cited authority. None of the cases uses the governmental/proprietary distinction as a basis for 
decision. Chief Justice Burger in his concurring opinion in Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 55 L. Ed. 2d at 386-391, did 
utilize this distinction in deciding that the city could not involve state action immunity. But neither the plurality opinion in that case 
or the majority opinion in Town of Hallie v. City of Eau-Claire incorporated that reasoning. Accordingly, whether defendant's conduct was proprietary or governmental is not the relevant consideration. Rather, whether 
state action immunity applies turns upon the analysis in the text. "

] Section 100 of the California Water Code provides that the state's water resources be put to beneficial use ""to the fullest extent of which they are capable"" and that conservation is to be exercised ""with a view to the reasonable and beneficial 
use thereof in the interest of the people and for the public welfare."" Cal. Water Code § 100 (West, 1971). HN7[
] Section 102 of the California Water Code declares that ""all water within the state is the property of the people of the state,"" but provides for the acquisition of rights to use water.HN8[

public use. "
83,3," HN10[
] Sections 43601-43602 of the California Government Code authorizes municipalities to incur indebtedness for water 
works and water rights subject to a two-thirds vote of the people. Additionally, HN11[
] section 38742(c) of the water code authorizes use of general obligation bonds to finance such acquisitions. Although authorization for public financing is not 
sufficient alone to express a ""clearly articulated"" state policy to displace competition, it is certainly evidence of such expression. 
Cf.  Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, Ohio, 742 F.2d at 962."
83,4," Defendant points to section 382 of the water code as authorization for its actions. That section provides: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, every local or regional public agency authorized by law to serve water to the 
inhabitants of the agency may sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise transfer water that is surplus to the needs of the agency's 
water uses for use outside of the agency. The authority granted to local and regional public agencies by this chapter shall 
not be construed as prohibiting or restricting the transfer of water or water rights pursuant to authority granted such 
agencies by provisions of law other than this chapter. Cal. Water Code § 382 (West Supp. 1985). But defendant's reliance is misplaced, for that section applies only to water rights 
held pursuant to an appropriation made after 1914. The water rights at issue here, however, are pre-1914 rights because they 
were acquired by the seller Tenneco West, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to 1914. See Declaration of Stanley C.  Hutch. "
88,5," The court also doubts whether the court's decision under the LGAA is to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, as 
plaintiff contends. When the standard of review is abuse of discretion, interlocutory appeal may not be appropriate primarily 
because of a low probability of reversal. In any case, the court does not think the issue controlling inasmuch as the Ninth Circuit 
has rarely hesitated to accept interlocutory appeals for cases reviewable only for abuse of discretion or for application of 
impermissible legal criteria. See, e.g., In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings, Etc., 691 F.2d 1335 (9th Cir. 1982). The distinction 
between ""discretionary"" and ""nondiscretionary"" cases is certainly questionable, as stated by the Third Circuit with these apt 
words: The key consideration is not whether the order involves the exercise of discretion, but whether it truly implicates the policies 
favoring interlocutory appeal. The determination of what orders are properly reviewable under § 1292(b) must be made by a 
practical application of those policies, not by a mechanical application of labels such as 'discretionary' or 'nondiscretionary.' 
Those policies, both before and since the enactment of § 1292(b) have included the avoidance of harm to a party pendente 
lite from a possibly erroneous interlocutory order and the avoidance of possibly wasted trial time and litigation expense. In 
this case, as subsequent discussion will disclose, there exists by virtue of the order appealed from both the possibility of 
prejudice to a party pendente lite and the possibility of considerable avoidable wasted trial time and litigation expense. Katz v. Carte Blanche Corporation, 496 F.2d 747, 756 (3d Cir. 1974). "
96,1," On April 12, 1985, the parties filed a stipulation and order re: Amendment Of Pleadings and to Clarify Identification of Party. 
Pursuant to said stipulation and order, the third amended complaint and all other previous pleadings were amended to the extent 
that the designation of defendant ""Mammoth Hospital District, Inc."" was changed to ""Southern Mono Hospital District, dba 
Mammoth Hospital District, Inc.""."
96,2," Two weeks prior to the scheduled oral argument on defendants' motions for summary judgment, the court was besieged with 
an ""opposition"" from plaintiff which contained approximately 1000 frequently unnumbered pages, comprised within four volumes. 
The opposition was written in narrative form with incomplete and/or missing citations and authority, various exhibits mismarked 
and unauthenticated, and a worthless index. While recognizing that a party may not prevail in opposition to a motion for 
summary judgment by simply overwhelming the district court with a ""miscellany of unorganized documentation,"" Zoslaw v. MCA 
Distributing Corp., 693 F.2d 870, 883 (9th Cir. 1982), the court has nonetheless gone through painstaking measures to insure 
that every proposition set forth by plaintiff has in some way, shape, or form been considered. Any error of the court in misstating 
or misconstruing a pertinent fact, argument or authority should fall upon plaintiff who had more than ample time to prepare an 
opposition and who has demonstrated no eagerness to comply with F.R.Civ.P. 56(e) much less to assist the court in its 
deliberations. For the ease of the reader, plaintiff's complaint has been broken down into two main parts, to wit, ""Civil Rights Violations"" and 
""Antitrust Violations."" The breakdown of plaintiff's allegations are not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive -- only to be used as a 
mechanism to assist in the court's analysis. "
98,3," At the present time, there are no witnesses to the altercation, independent or otherwise. In September, 1982, Dr. Matthews was 
killed in a single aircraft collision. On July 9, 1983, Dr. Stehlik committed suicide. "
99,4," On December 8, 1983, the court issued an order which granted plaintiff's motion for substitution of Renee Wright as special 
administratrix of the estate of Jan Jaroslav Stehlik."
99,5," On October 23, 1984, this court filed an order granting with prejudice defendants' motions to dismiss all claims under 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1985(3) for failure of plaintiff to plead class-based animus. Since a cause of action under § 1986 is dependent upon a valid 
claim under § 1985, this court will sua sponte dismiss plaintiff's § 1986 claim with prejudice.  Kaylor v. Fields, 661 F.2d 1177, 
1184 (8th Cir. 1981)."
99,6," See Plaintiff's Vol. I, p. 14, wherein the plaintiff requests that in order to remove redundancy from the second cause of action, 
the court strike all references except to section one of the Sherman Act. "
105,7," The letters, as indicated supra ironically enough came from the other combatant (Matthews) and four medical staff members 
(Tierney, Vawter, Lovell, and Paulson), who in turn were the same persons who voted for the imposition of a probationary term. 
From these conflicting minutes, the court again finds the following genuine issues of material fact, to wit: whether Stehlik was 
placed on probation for the May 22, 1982 incident or for receiving five corrective action letters from the same medical staff that 
voted for his probation? "
107,8," See also a letter dated May 30, 1983 from Dr. Tierney to Stehlik which, according to plaintiff, amounts to an unlawful residency 
requirement. The letter is set forth herein: Dear Dr. Stehlik, This letter is in request of information regarding your present status on Mammoth Hospital's active staff. According to our by-
laws, you must practice full time in Mammoth Lakes to be eligible for active staff privileges. Whereas you have expressed your intention to resign from Mammoth Hospital Staff due to practice relocation, you will no longer 
be eligible for active staff privileges at that time. I have received several communications that have indicated this situation to be 
true at the present time. Please notify me by letter within 10 days to formally document your present practice situation. . . . "
120,9," It is undisputed that throughout 1982, while Dr. Stehlik was on probation, he was the only orthopedic surgeon servicing the 
immediate area. See Plaintiff's Response to Interrogatory No. 179. Indeed, in pure pecuniary terms, the decedent's level of 
charges from May 1982 to the date of his departure from Mammoth Lakes in March 1983, remained undiminished save for 
October 1982 and in fact showed an increase in monthly terms for every month save June and October 1982. "
131,1, The plaintiff does not appeal the dismissal of the Hill-Burton Act claim.
131,2," Doe apparently did not appeal the Executive Committee's recommendation within ten days as required by the hospital's by-
laws. She claims, however, that the letter notifying her of the Executive Committee's recommendation failed to note the deadline 
for filing an appeal, and also failed to include a copy of the by-laws dealing with appeals, as required by the by-laws. Further, 
she argues that an appeal must be requested within ten days following the receipt of the recommendation, and that the letter of 
February 10, 1983, was not in the form of a recommendation. She also alleges that she sought review by the Board of Directors 
after the ten-day period and that counsel for the hospital later informed her orally that the summary suspension would not be 
revoked."
131,3," The district court's order incorrectly stated that the defendants had made a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon 
which relief could be granted and that the plaintiff had responded to this motion."
131,4," As of the time of the dismissal of this action, Doe did not have full staff privileges at any of the hospitals in Fort Wayne. She did, 
however, have applications pending at two hospitals. "
132,5," In this case the opportunity to amend the complaint would have been especially valuable with respect to plaintiff's section 1981 
claim. The case relied upon by the district court,  Anooya v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 733 F.2d 48 (7th Cir. 1984), was decided after 
the pleadings were filed in this case. "
133,6," We note that the Delaware district court has disagreed with our analysis in Marrese.  See  Quinn v. Kent Gen. Hosp., Inc., 617 
F. Supp. 1226, 1238-40 (D. Del. 1985)."
133,7," Plaintiff argues that even if Indiana ""actively supervises"" the medical peer process as it relates to quality of care, there is no 
reason to believe that Indiana ""actively supervises"" the medical peer review process as it relates to complaints unrelated to 
patient care. We see no reason why the state's active supervision of the peer review process, discussed thoroughly in Marrese, 
see  748 F.2d at 389-91, would not extend to this case. Further, it is not clear from the record that the reasons for plaintiff's dismissal are entirely unrelated to the quality of patient care. 
The letter of suspension referred to ""previous incidents of unprofessional behavior,"" which may be related to quality of care. 
Further, the specific incident complained of occurred in the presence of a patient who was facing serious surgery the next day. 
Doe's comments may have upset the patient, and thus adversely affected the quality of care she received. Finally, we note that 
the Executive Committee required Doe to complete a certified Physician Re-training Program before reapplying for staff 
privileges. This is not required by the hospital by-laws. One may well infer from this requirement some concern with the quality of 
Doe's patient care."
133,8," Plaintiff also argues that Marrese should be distinguished because in that case the plaintiff alleged that the defendants were 
acting within the Indiana peer review process, whereas Doe has not made a similar allegation. We do not think that this omission 
should distinguish this case from Marrese, for such a distinction would exalt form over substance and permit counsel to evade 
Marrese merely by careful drafting of their pleadings."
133,9," The Indiana legislature amended § 16-10-1-6.5, effective April 22, 1983, to require that: HN6[
] The governing board shall report, in writing, to the Indiana medical licensing board the results and circumstances 
of any final, substantive, and adverse disciplinary action taken by the governing board regarding a physician on the medical 
staff, or an applicant for the medical staff, if the action results in voluntary or involuntary resignation, termination, 
nonappointment, revocation or significant reduction of clinical privileges or staff membership. Ind. Code § 16-10-1-6.5(b) (1983). "
134,10," Antitrust claims like Doe's may border on the frivolous. See  Seglin v. Esau, 769 F.2d 1274, 1279 n.4 (7th Cir. 1985). "
135,11," Hereafter the entire class of intended beneficiaries, applicants and participants will be referred to as ""intended beneficiaries."""
135,12," As the district court notes, this position is consistent with 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-3, which in effect is a specific application of the 
intended beneficiary rule to employment practices. Section 2000d-3 provides: HN12[
] Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to authorize action under this subchapter by any

intervention into every aspect of the operations of recipients of federal financial assistance, Representative Celler stated: This title simply provides that, where Federal money is used to support any program or activity . . . the program must be 
used for the benefit of both races, without discrimination."

remand she believes that she can make this allegation, the district court should decide whether she should be allowed to amend 
her complaint."
137,17," The regulations to which plaintiff refers provide: (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not, directly 
or through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or national origin:"
137,*," * * (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any 
service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program; (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, 
eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford 
him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to 
participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section)."
137,*," * * (c) Employment practices. (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this 
regulation applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not (directly or through contractual arrangements) subject an 
individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program. . 
. ."
137,42," C.F.R. § 80.3. Section 80.4 sets forth the assurances that an applicant for federal financial assistance must make: The assurance required with respect to [a] . . . hospital, . . . insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices 
with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as . . . patients . . . of the institution or to the opportunity to 
participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution unless 
the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the institution's practices in 
designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which 
Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such programs. If in any such case the 
assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire 
facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith."
137,45," C.F.R. § 80.4(d)(2) (emphasis supplied). Section 80.5 of the regulations provides some examples of the application of the 
regulations. It provides, in part: In case of hospital construction grants the assurance will apply to patients, to interns, residents, student nurses, and other 
trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the hospital, 
and will apply to the entire facility for which, or for a part of which, the grant is made, and to facilities operated in connection 
therewith."
137,45, C.F.R. § 80.5(e) (emphasis supplied). 
138,18," We note that even if a private cause of action may arise under section 80.3(c)(3) of the regulations, plaintiff must establish 
that, under the general principles of third-party standing, she ought to be allowed to assert the rights of her patients. Plaintiff's 
complaint stated: ""Because of the doctor/patient relationship and the obstacle to the patient raising their own rights (including 
their lack of resources and the uncertainty as to whether and when they might need hospitalization), the plaintiff is asserting both 
her own rights and those of her patients."" However, plaintiff did not argue on appeal why she should be allowed to assert the 
rights of her patients and it is far from certain that she should be able to do so in this case."
138,19," Plaintiff does not argue that she should be permitted to amend her complaint in order to state a claim under Title VI. We leave 
this question to the district court to resolve on remand, should the question arise. "
139,20," HN16[
] Title VII defines ""employee"" as ""an individual employed by an employer,"" with certain exceptions.  42 U.S.C. §"
139,2000, e(f).
139,21," The appellant had filed a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and received a ""Notice of Right to 
Sue."""
139,22," Further, ""the Act, in providing for the filing of complaints with EEOC and of eventual actions in the District Court, does not use 
the term 'employee.' The phrase is, rather, the 'person aggrieved;' and that term can certainly be taken as comprehending 
individuals who do not stand in a direct employment relationship with an employer. . . .  It seems unlikely that Congress would 
confer standing to bring a suit under the Act upon persons without rights under the Act because they are not employees.""  
Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341. "
140,23," Doe alleged that she ""has suffered damage to her profession, her medical practice, her reputation and has been subjected to 
mental distress and suffering. She is suffering irreparable harm in that her medical practice is being irreparably damaged by her 
ability to care for patients in a hospital, thereby requiring patients and potential patients to seek medical care elsewhere."""
140,24," Appellees also assert that Sibley should be distinguished because the plaintiff in Sibley was an employee of the hospital. 
Appellees' Brief at 13. We have been unable to find support in the case for this assertion. Indeed, the court said that ""there 
seems to be no question that appellant and appellee did not contemplate any immediate or future relationship of direct 
employment in the sense of the usual indicia of such employment.""  Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1342; see  Martin v. Delaware Law 
School of Widener Univ., 625 F. Supp. 1288 (D. Del. 1985) (available on LEXIS) (""The hospital [in Sibley] did not actually employ 
the nurses.""). Appellees would also distinguish Sibley because in that case the hospital maintained the character of an employment agency. 
Once again, counsel misunderstands Sibley. The hospital did not discriminate in referring patients' offers of employment to 
nurses. Rather, the hospital discriminated by not permitting the referred nurse access to the patient. When the hospital denied 
the plaintiff access it was not acting in its role as ""employment agency."" The court in Sibley held that the hospital was similar to 
labor unions and employment agencies because it had a ""highly visible nexus with the creation and continuance of direct 
employment relationships between third parties."" Id. We think that Doe should be allowed to show both on summary judgment 
and, if appropriate, at trial that St. Joseph's has such a nexus. "
141,25," For example, in  Gomez v. Alexian Bros. Hosp., 698 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983), the plaintiff was a Hispanic physician who 
practiced medicine as an employee of the professional corporation AES. Plaintiff alleged a Title VII violation when the contract 
proposal that AES submitted to the hospital for the operation of the emergency room was rejected, allegedly because many of 
AES' employees were Hispanic. Under the proposal the plaintiff was to serve as the director of the hospital's emergency room. 
The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants because there was no present or potential employment 
relationship between plaintiff and defendant; the plaintiff would in any case remain an employee of AES. The Ninth Circuit 
reversed, holding that ""the fact that plaintiff continues as an employee of AES does not mean the employment relationship 
between AES and plaintiff has not been interfered with. The conditions of plaintiff's employment are different than they would 
have been had he not been discriminated against.""  Id. at 1021."
141,26," The plaintiff alleged that his practice was injured because the defendant hospital was the most convenient, had special 
equipment and because he had lost patients because he did not have staff privileges there."
141,27," The court held that whether or not the plaintiff had access to other hospital facilities was not relevant to Title VII.   Pao, 547 F. 
Supp. at 494. "
142,28," In Pao the court placed the word ""employers"" within quotation marks, thus indicating that a common law employment 
relationship is not required between the physician and her patients. Indeed we note that the common law independent 
contractor/employee test is often not applied to antidiscrimination legislation, because ""it is considered inconsistent with the 
remedial purposes behind such legislation.""  Mares v. Marsh, 777 F.2d 1066, 1067 n.1 (5th Cir. 1985) (citing cases). Instead, 
other, less restrictive tests such as the ""economic realities"" test or a hybrid of that test are used. See id. (citing cases using these 
other tests); see also  EEOC v. Dowd & Dowd, Ltd., 736 F.2d 1177 (7th Cir. 1984) (recognizing the ""economic realities"" test). We note that a later case involving a motion for summary judgment and decided in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,  Amro v. 
St. Luke's Hosp., 39 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1574 (E.D. Penn. 1986), apparently disagreed, on the basis of the ""hybrid"" 
test, with the conclusion in Pao. The court in Amro, however, based its decision upon the relationship between the physician and 
the hospital. Amro does not discuss what relationship was required between the physician and her patients. The court assumed 
that there must be an employment relationship between the physician and the hospital without even discussing Sibley. The Amro 
court held that under the ""hybrid"" test there was no employment relationship between the physician and the hospital and thus the 
physician could not bring a Title VII action."
142,29," Further, the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies raises certain factual issues that we cannot properly decide. See 
supra note 2."
142,30," We recognize, of course, that a charge must be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission before proceeding 
in court under Title VII. Plaintiff filed a timely charge with the EEOC and received a ""Notice of Right to Sue"" dated September 30, 
1983."
142,31," We note that appellees concede that the by-laws of St. Joseph Hospital, under which they claim plaintiff should have pursued 
her administrative remedies, are considered a contract between the hospital and the physician granted staff privileges. See 
Appellees' Brief at 21 (citing authority). "
144,1," Dr. Doe alleged in her complaint that she has applied for ""staff privileges"" at other Ft. Wayne hospitals but that she had not as 
yet been granted those privileges. However, the fact that no other hospital has accorded her privileges does not require St. 
Joseph's to keep her on staff."
144,2," This analysis applies with equal force to  Gomez v. Alexian Bros. Hosp., 698 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983). In Gomez, the plaintiff 
was a Hispanic physician who practiced medicine as a professional corporation under the name American Emergency Services 
Professional Corporation Medical Group (AES). In 1978, AES submitted a bid to run the defendant's emergency room. Plaintiff 
was to act as director of the emergency room, and five of the twelve participating physicians were to be Hispanic. The hospital 
rejected the bid. The court found that Dr. Gomez stated a cause of action under Title VII because he alleged that the hospital's 
refusal, purportedly on racial grounds, ""denied him the opportunity to be employed by AES as director of defendant's emergency 
room.""  Id. at 1021. The employment opportunity sought by Gomez was to handle emergency patient care on a full-time basis. Patients in need of 
such emergency care seek it from health care facilities not individual physicians. By refusing the AES bid, the hospital effectively 
precluded Gomez from any access to emergency medical patients. Again, Dr. Doe has not been so hampered."
144,3," A subsequent decision from the same district has substantially undercut the rationale of Pao.  In  Amro v. St. Luke's Hosp., 39 
Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1574 (E.D. Pa. 1986), the court held that ""even though the defendant hospital may exercise 
economic control over the plaintiff's future to earn income, this is not sufficient to counterbalance all the other factors which tend 
to classify the doctor as an independent contractor.""  Id. at 1577. "
153,1," To date, discovery has consisted of one deposition conducted by defendants of plaintiff Welch. The Court stayed further 
discovery, including additional depositions already noticed, by oral order on July 1, 1985, pending decision on this motion. "
155,2," The ""rule of reason"" analysis, as opposed to the ""per se illegal"" analysis, would eventually apply to this case."
155,3," The court's requirement that the Society in National Society should rescind and state the fact of recission of an unlawful rule as 
a remedy for violation of antitrust law is much like the factual case herein, despite the APA's argument to the contrary. Plaintiffs 
here do not contend that the APA's expression of opinion as to the need for a psychiatric residency is unlawful in itself, but rather 
that the psychiatric residency requirement may be only an insignificant part of the justification for the allegedly unlawful restraint 
of trade. Plaintiffs do not attack the ""opinion or belief"" of the defendants as unlawful, but rather challenge the asserted violation 
acted upon via admissions criteria, which they feel is commercially, rather than intellectually motivated. "
156,4," In Associated General, the Court stated that: [h]arm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court must 
make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. "
157,459," U.S. at 536, n.31 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs herein properly allege harm ""sufficient to satisfy"" the injury in fact predicate of 
antitrust standing. For the reasons discussed in the text above, plaintiffs are determined, at this time, to be proper parties to 
bring the instant action. "
161,1," Mitsubishi is explicitly limited to an international context involving multinational agreements calling for international arbitration. 
In that context, the Court held, considerations of international comity require special deference to the expressed desire of the 
parties to avoid the unpredictability that might result from international forum shopping.  Here, however, no such special 
considerations apply: The agreement at issue was executed in New York and concerns only United States distribution. The only 
international component in what is otherwise a routine New York agreement is the citizenship of one of the parties. Thus, the 
Second Circuit's reasoning that in the antitrust area, public policy requires public judicial elucidation of these important public law 
norms and that it is inappropriate to rely on market mechanisms to determine the forum for adjudication of statutes designed to 
remedy market failures, clearly applies."
161,2," Plaintiff cites Sprinzen v. Nomberg, 46 N.Y.2d 623, 415 N.Y.S.2d 974, 389 N.E.2d 456 (1979) and Riccardi v. Modern Silver 
Linen Supply Co., 36 N.Y.2d 945, 373 N.Y.S.2d 551, 335 N.E.2d 856 (1975) for the proposition that non-competition provisions 
are arbitrable. But those cases concern an employee's covenant not to compete with his employer, and are subject to a different 
set of considerations entirely. Indeed, I note that even under New York law, which does not apply here, claimed antitrust 
violations are not arbitrable. Sprinzen, 415 N.Y.S.2d at 977; Aimcee Wholesale Corp. v. Tomar Products, 21 N.Y.2d 621, 289 
N.Y.S. 2d 968, 237 N.E.2d 223 (1968). "
162,3," Even had plaintiff clearly moved to enjoin competition pendente lite, which it has not, such a motion probably would have to be 
denied.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, a preliminary injunction may issue only if -- in the first instance -- plaintiff can show that in the 
absence of an injunction it will suffer some irreparable injury, such as total destruction of its business. See Semmes Motors, Inc. 
v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197 (2d Cir. 1970). Mere loss of business is considered compensable by damages and does not 
suffice. Here, plaintiff alleges that 30 % of its business was related to defendant's products. However, it does not contend that it 
has any right to continue on as distributor of those products, so I must consider not whether plaintiff can remain in business 
without the distributorship, but rather only the marginal, incremental difficulty it will have if it not only doesn't have the 
distributorship but also has the additional competition of B & B selling in the U.S. a product line that plaintiff no longer may sell. 
This increment seems unlikely to meet the tests set out in Semmes, 429 F.2d 1197, and Roso-lino Beverage Distributors, Inc. v. 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 749 F.2d 124 (2d Cir.1984). "
165,*, It should be noted that the complaints are substantially identical. 
173,1," This opinion will assume familiarity with the Opinion and its terminology. It will not repeat either the Opinion's factual statement 
(including most of its defined terms) or its substantive analysis, except to the extent required for current discussion."
173,2," As this opinion later reflects, that dismissal did not terminate the entire action, because Teleflora had filed a counterclaim 
against AFS."
173,3," As the only relevant Rules are 56 and 59, no confusion should be engendered by pressing the word ""Rule"" into double service, 
applying it to FTD's Membership Rule 18(b) as well."
173,4," Because the opinion was not a final order (see n.2) and there was thus no judgment entered in the case, Rule 59 does not of 
course apply.  This seems to be a simple mistake, rather than another example of the general disinclination of AFS' counsel to 
play by the Rules (a predilection that shows up in far more serious instances, discussed later in this opinion). Moreover, the 
motion's mislabeling does no harm. Accordingly this opinion will address the merits of the motion to vacate rather than its 
incorrect label. "
175,5," AFS R. Mem. 3 suggests FTD's market share is really 70%. That scarcely qualifies as grounds for reconsideration. Opinion slip 
op. at 51-52 & n.29 discussed AFS' claims in that respect (showing a decline in FTD's asserted position from 74% in 1980 to 68-
1/2% in 1984). Thus any current claim of a 70% figure would represent a minor and immaterial differential, but even that is not 
the critical issue. As this opinion's later discussion shows, that new figure -- even if accepted as true -- does not alter the 
Opinion's result."
175,6," One of AFS' claims (echoed by Hausman Aff. para. 32) is that FTD's not-for-profit status gives it a tax advantage over AFS 
(and Teleflora too, of course)."
175,7," It is not clear just how large the Blues' market share was. Though more than 80% of some Indiana hospitals' patients were 
covered by the Blues, and throughout that state some 50% of all hospitals' revenues came through the Blues, the Blues argued 
they insured only about 27% of Indiana patients. But as Ball Memorial goes on to say (725 F.2d 1325, slip op. at 4): Just how ""large"" the Blues are turns out not to matter, so we do not pursue the question. "
176,," And that statement clearly refers to Ball Memorial's later analysis ( id. 725 F.2d 1325, slip op. at 14-15): Still, the Hospitals say the conclusion [that there are no entry barriers] is legally irrelevant. Ease of entry and the absence of 
barriers do not matter if the defendant has a large market share. The Hospitals are wrong. Market share is just a way of 
estimating market power, which is the ultimate consideration. When there are better ways to estimate market power, the 
court should use them."
176,*," * * * The inquiry in each case is the ability to control output and prices, an ability that depends largely on the ability of other firms 
to increase their own output in response to a contracting by the defendants. Indeed it is usually best to derive market share 
from ability to exclude other sources of supply . . . . If the definition of the market builds in a conclusion that there are no 
significant additional sources of supply and no substitutes from the consumer's perspective, then market share indicates 
power over price. Here AFS has tendered not a shred of evidence even hinting it (or Teleflora or Carik or Redbook or any and all other 
clearinghouses, either singly or in the aggregate) could not readily step in to fill any gap left by a constriction in FTD's output or 
that FTD has any means of preventing them from doing so. Indeed all the evidence before this Court on the Rule 56 motions 
pointed in exactly the opposite direction: AFS was both anxious and able to do just that."
176,8," Hausman Aff. para. 14 correctly observes the Opinion ""displays some hesitation in accepting the rebate as a 'discount.'"" 
Certainly the rebate is not a direct discount to customers unless passed along to them when AFS is used instead of FTD -- and it 
is not. Opinion at 221 n.28 did recognize the possible long-term benefit to a florist whose total operation is made more profitable 
by collecting AFS rebates. But aside from the question whether that benefit is readily translatable into a consumer benefit (the 
only kind relevant for antitrust analysis), that sort of benefit is no different from the long-term benefit florists derive from national 
advertising and product development, which also may make a florist more profitable. AFS' rebate is entitled to no special 
antitrust deference. To repeat: Rebates and FTD's product/service package are economically fungible. "
177,9," It must also be remembered the Opinion's market-power analysis was explicitly premised on a ""worst-case"" analysis of Rule 
18(b)(see Opinion at 221 n.30). Because Rule 18(b) provides Sending Florists may use other clearinghouses if they obtain the 
Customer's express permission, florists are free to make extensive use of AFS. FTD's market share is thus even more tenuously 
related to any power it assertedly has over the clearings market than would be required to fail the Ball Memorial test."
177,10," Again reflecting a total disregard for the time-and-place aspects of the litigative process, AFS seeks to invoke discovery 
measures (requests to admit or depositions) now to cure its own lack-of-authentication problems. But FTD and Teleflora raised 
those flaws during the Rule 56 process. AFS had the opportunity to do something about the matter then. It didn't. Once more the 
analogy to pre-trial (permissible) and post-trial (impermissible) establishment of a proper trial record compels rejection of AFS' 
current efforts. "
178,11," Tenacious to the death (or in this instance even post-mortem), counsel for AFS have just asked leave to file an unbidden reply 
memorandum on their current motion, (1) purporting to explain how Ball Memorial should be read and (2) offering still another 
set of documents. Counsel's efforts induce a sense of deja vu. They are the same law firm that represented another litigant -- 
Car Carriers, Inc. -- before this Court in a case in which they likewise presented a wrongheaded view of the antitrust laws and 
tried unsuccessfully to cure the fatal flaws in their position by belated attempts to beef up the record. See Car Carriers, Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 561 F. Supp. 885 (N.D. Ill. 1983), aff'd, 745 F.2d 1101 (7th Cir. 1984), cert.  denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 
1758, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1985). Counsel were unsuccessful in Car Carriers, and they deserve no better fate here. Leave to file 
the memorandum is granted (simply because this Court has read it), but leave to file the new evidence is denied for the reasons 
previously stated. "
194,1," Defendants have argued to the Court that their proposed sale of real estate to Toys ""R"" Us does not result in a breach of the 
Lease, given their procurement of an opinion from special counsel to the effect that Section 43(A) is unlawful under the federal 
antitrust laws. Defendants' theory, unfortunately, is one whose time has not yet come. Even if Defendants' special counsel had 
unequivocally stated that Section 43(A) was illegal as applied to the specific facts of the case, which does not appear from the 
record to have been the case, Section 43(A) of the lease provides for certain covenants to be observed by Landlord and Tenant 
""except insofar as [such covenants] shall be unlawful."" The determination of whether an agreement of this nature is unlawful 
must come from a court of law, not from special counsel, no matter how experienced. Defendants' determination of the 
unlawfulness of the restrictive covenant contained in Section 43(A), no matter how reasonable, is not a defense to their breach 
of the Lease."
194,2," The Court does not consider Defendants' challenge to Section 43(A) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as 
the federal courts have held that no private right of action exists under the Act.  Baum v. Great Western Cities, Inc. of New "
195,," Mexico, 703 F.2d 1197, 1209 (10th Cir. 1983); Dreisbach v. Murphy, 658 F.2d 720, 730 (9th Cir. 1981); Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v. 
Interstate Cigar Company, Inc., 499 F.2d 232, 237 (2d Cir. 1974). "
196,3," Even were this Court to conclude that the requisite nexus with interstate commerce was lacking in this case, Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act would remain relevant to this Court's analysis. Subject matter jurisdiction herein is based upon diversity of 
citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and Defendants have invoked Ohio's Valentine Act as an additional ground for the illegality of 
Section 43(A). Decisions under the Sherman Act, after which the Valentine Act was modeled, are used as guidelines in the 
resolution of issues under the Valentine Act. C.K. & J.K., Inc. v. Fairview Shopping Center Corp., 63 Ohio St.2d 201, 204, 407 
N.E2d 507, 509 (Ohio 1980). "
198,4," Lektro-Vend Corp. involved non-competition agreements signed by a company and its founder after the sale of the company's 
assets to Vendo, a competitor. Shortly after the execution of these agreements, the company and its founder gave financial and 
other assistance to individuals engaged in the development of a product in direct competition with the assets which had been 
purchased by Vendo. This assistance occurred in the very community where the company bound by the covenant not to 
compete had been based.  Although the restrictive covenants binding the company and its founder were of national and 
international scope, the Seventh Circuit enforced them to the extent necessary to prohibit the conduct described supra.  660 
F.2d at 264-269."
198,5," The parties have stipulated that the site of the proposed Toys ""R"" Us store, on a parcel sold by Defendants to Toys ""R"" Us, is 
one-half mile from Plaintiff's Children's Palace store. As a practical matter, the proposed Toys ""R"" Us store may be slightly more 
or slightly less than one-half mile from the Children's Palace store in question. By accepting the stipulations of the parties, the 
Court's intent and purpose is to enforce Section 43(A) to cover the one-half mile distance between Plaintiff's Children's Palace 
store and the proposed Toys ""R"" Us store, plus or minus whatever geographic increment is necessary to fully embrace the 
actual distance separating the locations of these establishments. "
199,6," The six-mile scope of Section 43(A) is, as Defendants have pointed out, a geographic restriction of considerable magnitude. 
The Court has not been presented with any decisions upholding a modern shopping center lease exclusivity clause of this 
breadth. Nor can the Court take judicial notice of the reasonableness of such a restriction in the Miami Township environs.  The 
Court believes, accordingly, that a hearing would be required before the reasonableness of Section 43(A), on its face, could be 
determined.  Obviously, this belief as to the necessity of a hearing on the validity of a six-mile restriction, as opposed to 
enforcement of a one-half mile restriction without a hearing, poses the question of the proper judicial treatment of a restriction 
falling between these two poles in geographic scope. Given the facts in this case, the Court needs not reach the questions 
posed by restrictive covenants falling within this intermediate group. "
200,7," The Court notes that, after upholding the restrictive covenant under the Valentine Act, the C.K. & J.K., Inc. court summarily held 
that the covenants were not contrary to Ohio public policy.  63 Ohio St.2d at 206, 407 N.E.2d at 510. "

215,6," Blue Shield considers this to be the relevant market for purposes of this case. "". . . [A] Blue Shield plan's status as a buyer and providers' status as sellers of services is basic to the application of the

218,10," Blue Shield intimates that the dentists sought to retain certain advantages of Blue Shield's presence in the market without 
doing business with Blue Shield. This is misleading. Blue Shield's practice, the record indicates, is to pay benefits to the patient 
when the dentist is not a participating dentist. Thus, the dentist's relationship to his patient is largely unaffected by Blue Shield's 
presence in the background as a third-party payor. To the extent that patients, because of insurance coverage, purchase 
services they would otherwise forego, that is merely a neutral factor arising naturally from the existence of this sort of insurance 
and nothing the dentists are responsible for. Furthermore, even if Blue Shield did pay non-participating dentists directly, thereby 
benefiting them by virtue of certainty of payment, that too would merely be a neutral factor arising from the existence of 
insurance coverage in the market. "
220,11," The UCR reimbursement mechanism, as we observed, discounts some dentists' usual fees, in exchange for which the dentist 
realizes certainty of payment.  574 F. Supp. at 469. The fact that some dentists' fees are discounted does not reasonably 
support the inference that the dentists' objections to the participating dentist mechanism had the purpose or effect of stabilizing 
or fixing prices for dental services or that the dentists' unwillingness to participate had an anticompetitive effect. "
221,12," Another market might briefly be considered -- the market in which various dental insurers sell various forms of prepaid dental 
insurance.  Blue Shield can not reasonably claim any antitrust injury in that market as the result of the dentists' conduct. Blue 
Shield has 32 to 35% of all dental prepayment plans in this market. See, App. to dentists' brief in opposition to motion for 
summary judgment, Doc. 879, pages 52-53. The dentists, in support of their summary judgment motion, have presented very 
persuasive evidence that Blue Shield has not suffered antitrust injury in that market. While Blue Shield does not have a 
monopoly in that market, 574 F. Supp. at 472, it is beyond any question the dominant seller in that market. Blue Shield's position that the dentists' departicipation has an anticompetitive effect in that market may be seen to be premised 
upon its contention that, but for the dentists' departicipation, it could sell for lower prices in that market and in that sense make 
that market more competitive. As we have seen, however, that contention is premised upon the unsupported speculation that 
Blue Shield's program ""discounts"" the cost of dental services. As we have said, we do not find the evidence to show this to be 
true and we found to the contrary in the earlier decision. If Blue Shield's objective is in fact to gain ""control"" of the dentists so as 
to discount the price of dental services, (1) we erred in our earlier decision, and (2) the dentists' concerted conduct, to the extent 
that it was motivated by economic factors, was pro-competitive because it sought merely to maintain a free market in Market I; 
that is, a market in which economic power is dispensed, competition is high, and a competitor stands to prosper upon his or her 
merits. Since the dentists are not in the insurance market in any sense, that market is not a relevant market for purposes of this 
case."
221,13," Blue Shield cites, as an example of the boycott against it, the PDA's refusal to print an advertisement in the PDA's publication 
by which Blue Shield would have sought to solicit additional participating dentists in central Pennsylvania. There is no doubt, of 
course, that PDA was and apparently remains opposed to the participating dentist concept. The rejection of Blue Shield's 
advertisement is but one of many manifestations of that opposition. The resolutions of the dentists who agreed that they would 
not participate is another. But the fact that many of the dentists and PDA opposed the concept of participation with Blue Shield 
and acted consistent with that philosophy in their affairs certainly does not of itself warrant the conclusion that their actions were 
anticompetitive. If that were so, protected speech and associational activities would be seriously jeopardized. "

243,1," During the course of oral argument on this motion, the NFL contended that the exemption is absolute with respect to the sale of 
broadcast rights only.  The NFL concedes that the exemption does not apply to aspects of contracts that contain terms 
extending beyond the sale of such rights.  See Transcript of Proceedings at 40 (April 11, 1986)."
243,2," The apparent reason for the label ""single network plan"" used by the NFL owners was that the legislation allowed the NFL, for 
the first time, to sell the telecast rights of the individual member clubs' to one seller.  Deposition of Alvin R. Rozelle at 302.  ""The 
objective of this legislation is to give us the right to go on a single network."" Telecasting of Professional Sports Contests: 
Hearings on H.R. 8757 before the Antitrust Subcomm. (Subcomm. No. 5) of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 87 Cong., 1st 
Sess. 35 (1961) (statement if Hamilton Carothers, NFL counsel) (emphasis added). This position has to be contrasted with the situation at the time the first CBS pooled rights contract was made.  In 1960, nine 
teams had contracts with CBS, two teams had contracts withe NBC, and two teams, Washington and Cleveland, had contracts 
with sponsors.  United States v. NFL, Transcript of Proceedings, at 69-71 (E.D. Pa. July 27, 1961).  The games of a popular 
team, such as the New York Giants, therefore would be telecast frequently and over a broad area, while the games of a less 
popular team would be aired less frequently, if at all, and to smaller audiences.  Id. at 67.  The resultant disparity in television 
income would upset the league's competitive balance.  Id. Only by selling the telecast rights of the individual clubs in a package "
244,," to a network could the league ""insure that [the] clubs will continue to have the income to enable them to be competitive on the 
field."" Id. Judge Grim's decision prohibited the clubs from entering into such a contract.  United States v. NFL, 196 F. Supp. 445 (E.D. Pa. 
1961). Therefore, the apparent significance to the NFL of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 was that the league would be able 
to sell the clubs' telecasting rights as a package to a network, not that the league would be limited to one network. "
250,1," The USFL also cites the Congressional testimony of Ed Garvey, former Director of the National Football League Players 
Association, in support of its allegation that the NFL violated the antitrust laws in causing the demise of the WFL. See Transcript 
of Proceedings at 76 (April 11, 1986).  According to Mr. Garvey, because the [NFL] can negotiate with all three networks, it is difficult for any potential competitor such as the World Football 
League to survive. One might well trace the downfall of the World Football League to the fact that all three networks carry 
NFL football and that can be traced to the 1961 exemption. Inquiry into Professional Sports: Hearings Before the House Select Comm.  on Professional Sports, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 219 
(1976). This testimony does nothing more, however, than to highlight, as the court observed in Mid-South Grizzlies v. NFL, 720

competitors, result in antitrust liability.  But the issue of competition by another league is not presented here . . . ."" Id. at 785 n.7. "
253,4," The USFL argues that Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 73, 570 F.2d 982 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 
956, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1121, 98 S. Ct. 3069 (1978), which involved a challenge to certain exclusive lease provisions, should also be 
considered an adverse result to the NFL. But, the NFL was dismissed from this case, and the decision reversing a jury verdict in 
favor of the Redskins ruled that certain jury instructions were erroneous.  570 F.2d at 998-99. The court did not hold that the 
exclusive lease provisions violated the antitrust laws. "
260,1," Plaintiffs in this action are the United States Football League and certain of its member clubs (hereinafter collectively referred 
to as the ""USFL""). Defendants are the National Football League, its commissioner and certain of its member clubs (hereinafter 
collectively referred to as the ""NFL""). The USFL has sued the NFL for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, for 
alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 & 2. Plaintiffs also seek similar relief under two 
pendent common law claims for interference with existing and prospective contractual relations."
260,2," The nature of each of these ""claims"" is detailed at the beginning of Parts I, II, and III of this opinion."
260,3," The amended complaint sets forth four causes of action. Count I seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as damages, 
for alleged violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Amended Complaint (""AC"") PP 14-75. Count II (which incorporates the 
allegations in Count I) seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as damages, for alleged violations of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. AC PP 76-86. Count III seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as damages, under the common law 
principles of intentional interference with contract. AC PP 87-92. Count IV seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as 
damages, under the common law principles of intentional interference with (prospective) business and contractual relations. AC 
PP 93-99. "
261,4," Specifically, the USFL alleges that certain NFL teams have obtained ""unlawful exclusivity provisions and other illegal restrictive 
provisions"" in their respective stadium agreements that have effectively prevented the USFL teams in the same territories from 
using those stadia in the fall, or (in some instances) at any time. See AC P 67. Plaintiffs further allege that defendants have 
obtained and enforced such restrictive provisions in stadium leases ""in order to foreclose potential competition by the [USFL]."" 
AC P 68. Plaintiffs elsewhere allege that defendants violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by ""attempting to monopolize, conspiring to 
monopolize and monopolizing the market for essential stadium facilities in which to play major league professional football in 
major metropolitan areas throughout the United States."" AC P 71(d). The NFL has pointed out that this allegation rests, in part, 
upon the dubious assumption that the only stadium facilities suitable to major league football are those in which an NFL team is 
already playing. See NFL Stadium Memorandum at 33-35 (arguing that a Section 2 claim based on stadia interference must fail 
because the relevant geographic market is nationwide and the USFL has undisputed access to stadia throughout the country)."
261,5," These are: Jack Murphy Stadium (leased by the NFL's San Diego Chargers); Cleveland Stadium (leased by the NFL's 
Cleveland Browns); Candlestick Park (leased by the NFL's San Francisco 49ers); New Orleans Superdome (leased by the NFL's 
New Orleans Saints); Mile High Stadium (leased by the NFL's Denver Broncos); Pontiac Silverdome (leased by the NFL's Detroit 
Lions); Memorial Stadium (leased in 1983 by the NFL's Baltimore Colts); Veterans Stadium (leased by the NFL's Philadelphia 
Eagles); and Alamo Stadium in San Antonio. In addition, the USFL has alleged improper conduct by defendants with respect to Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, where the 
NFL's Minnnesota Vikings have been granted an exclusive lease to play pro football, a lease the Metropolitan Sports Facilities 
Commission (as a state authority) is authorized to grant under the Sports Facilities Act, Minn. Stat. Ann. § 473.551 et seq. (West 
1977 and Supp. 1985). "
262,6," Plaintiffs have alleged that the USFL was unlawfully denied access to Cleveland Stadium, which is operated by the Cleveland 
Browns (an NFL club and a party-defendant in this action), rather than by the City of Cleveland or any other local governmental 
authority. However, for reasons set forth infra at n.11, the Court concludes that no evidence exists in the record to support the 
conclusion that defendants violated the antitrust laws by denying plaintiffs access to Cleveland Stadium."
262,7," See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961); 
United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965). "
263,8," It is generally recognized that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine serves two necessary functions: First, it preserves ""the open 
communication between the polity and its lawmakers which is vital to the functioning of a representative democracy."" City of 
Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 399, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978). Second, it protects the 
first amendment right to petition government for the redress of grievances. Id.; In re Airport Car Rental, 693 F.2d at 86."
263,9," Although plaintiffs might have argued that the policies served by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would not be served by 
protecting the particular conduct at issue in this case, the USFL has never made this specific argument. Absent an affirmative 
showing that the antitrust laws should apply, the Court should assume that commercial activity is not exempted from Noerr-
Pennington protection. See In re Airport Car Rental, 693 F.2d at 88. Similarly, there is no reason to consider whether the ""sham 
exception"" to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies in this case, since plaintiffs have never even raised this issue See Miracle 
Mile, 617 F.2d at 21 (addressing only those instances of sham petition claimed by appellants); see also Independent Taxicab 
Drivers' Employees, 760 F.2d at 612 n.9 (although existence of ""sham-ful"" conduct is generally a question of fact for the jury, 
plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence to survive motion for summary judgment)."
263,10," In arguing that defendants' stadium-related conduct is immune from antitrust attack, the NFL has also relied on the Local 
Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36 (Supp. II 1984) (""LGAA"") as well as the doctrine of state action immunity. Such reliance appears misplaced. Although the LGAA bars recovery of damages under the antitrust laws ""in any claim against a 
person based on any official action directed by a local government, or official or employee thereof acting in an official capacity,"" 
15 U.S.C. § 36, it is questionable whether defendants were ever ""directed"" by local governmental authorities within the meaning "
264,," of the LGAA. In addition, it should be noted that the LGAA does not apply to claims for injunctive relief under the Sherman Act. 
Montauk-Carribean Airways, Inc. v. Hope, 784 F.2d 91, 95 (2d Cir. 1986). Similarly, the doctrine of state action immunity, first set forth in the Supreme Court's decision in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 
87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), does not clearly apply to the present action, in which all defendants are private parties, but 
in which the NFL has offered only minimal evidence to show that any of its clubs acted ""pursuant to a [state's] anticompetitive 
regulatory program."" See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 1730-31, 85 
L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985) (private party may rely on state action immunity provided it can point to the legislature's clear intent, 
evidenced by statute, to displace competition). In any event, it would invite confusion to evaluate defendants' stadium-related 
conduct under both the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and the state action doctrine, since these doctrines, although related, are 
based on analytically distinct policy considerations. See City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 399-
400, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978). Indeed, the independent application of the two doctrines may not always yield 
uniform results. See In re Airport Car Rental, 693 F.2d at 87 (""It would be inapt to require symmetry.""); but see Independent 
Taxicab Drivers' Employees, 760 F.2d at 613 (""There is no such case as Parker v. Noerr-Pennington."")."
264,11," As noted earlier, supra at 6, plaintiffs' allegations regarding denial of access to Cleveland Stadium are not subject to Noerr-
Pennington analysis, since Cleveland Stadium's operations are controlled by the Cleveland Browns, an NFL club. Plaintiffs allege that two prospective USFL franchisees, Carl Hirsch and Milton Maltz, were unlawfully denied access to 
Cleveland Stadium. The evidence submitted to the Court regarding Cleveland Stadium is contained in plaintiff's deposition of 
Arthur B. Modell (hereinafter ""Modell Dep.""), the principal owner of the Cleveland Browns. In his deposition, Modell testified that he had met in his office with Hirsch and Maltz, who asked whether Cleveland Stadium 
would be available for use by a Cleveland USFL franchise. Modell Dep. at 77-78. Modell replied that the stadium was available, 
though subject to the approval of the Cleveland Indians (the major league baseball team that leases Cleveland Stadium during 
the spring, the same season during which the proposed USFL club would have played). Id. Modell also recalled some discussion 
of a minimum guarantee by a leasing USFL club of $ 100,000 a year, to be applied against a ten percent rental. Id. at 80. At a subsequent meeting, Hirsch and Maltz told Modell that they had decided not to apply for a USFL franchise in Cleveland, 
and had chosen instead to purchase an interest in the USFL Washington Federals. Modell Dep. at 79. There is no evidence in 
the record, however, that Hirsch or Maltz or anyone involved with the USFL ever approached the Cleveland Indians to discuss 
the possibility of a USFL franchise playing in Cleveland Stadium. Based on Modell's deposition testimony, the USFL argues that Hirsch and Maltz (and thus the USFL) were denied access to 
Cleveland Stadium because Modell imposed ""conditions"" so onerous that the prospect of leasing was effectively foreclosed. This 
allegation, however, is nothing more than a conclusory statement unsupported by specific facts in the record, and thus cannot be 
used by a party opposing summary judgment to establish the existence of a triable issue of fact. See JSP Agency, Inc. v. 
American Sugar Refining Co., 752 F.2d 56, 59 (2d Cir. 1985). Finally, plaintiffs seek to add a conspiratorial gloss to Modell's negotiations with Hirsch and Maltz by producing evidence that 
Modell received legal advice on the matter from Hamilton Carothers, a member of Covington & Burling, the NFL's general 
counsel. Significantly, however, no evidence has been offered regarding the nature of Carothers' advice or even as to whether 
Modell ever applied counsel's advice. Thus, plaintiffs are essentially arguing that the consultation of a lawyer can, with nothing 
more, constitute anticompetitive conduct in violation of the Sherman Act. This remarkable argument must be rejected of its own 
weight. In sum, there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that any of the defendants herein ever violated the antitrust 
laws (or any other laws) by denying the USFL or any of its representatives access to Cleveland Stadium for the staging of USFL 
games."
264,12," Thus, the general principle that ""otherwise innocent or ambiguous behavior may violate the Sherman Act when considered 
together with the remainder of the conduct,"" United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 524 F. Supp. 1336, 1344 (D. D.C. 1981) 
(citing Supreme Court cases), does not apply when the behavior at issue is protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. "
265,13," Not the least of these evidentiary concerns is the overwhelmingly hearsay character of the evidence offered by the USFL to 
support its allegations of stadia interference, see supra at 7."
265,14," In moving for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' stadium-related ""claims,"" the NFL alternatively moved to sever the trial of 
such claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), which permits a district court to order a separate trial of ""any claim . . . or of any "
266,," separate issue"" for purposes such as judicial convenience or the avoidance of prejudice. Although it has not been necessary to 
rule on defendants' Rule 42(b) motion, it is worth noting that the application is not without merit. In Reading Industries, Inc. v. Kennecott Copper Corp., 61 F.R.D. 662 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), the Court applied Rule 42(b) to sever one 
of three counts in a complex antitrust lawsuit in which plaintiffs had sued defendants under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, 
and the Robinson-Patman Act. In so ruling, the Court noted certain factors to be considered in ordering a severance, including, 
inter alia, the presence of significant differences in the issues to be separately tried, and the likelihood that ""the separate issues 
[would] require the testimony of different witnesses and documentary proof."" Id. at 664. Thus, although Reading Industries is 
dissimilar from the present action in numerous respects, the analysis applied in that case is certainly relevant to the concerns 
this Court has already expressed with regard to the USFL's stadium-related allegations."
266,15," As part of their pendent common law claims, plaintiffs assert that defendants, by means of encouraging disparaging public 
comment and disseminating press reports, have unlawfully interfered with the present and prospective business and contractual 
relations of the USFL. See AC P 89(d)(ii) (defendants encouraged ""disparaging public comments by ABC as to the USFL quality 
of play and future prospects"") and AC P 95(g) (defendants ""disseminate[ed] press reports that reflect negatively on the USFL to 
media and press around the country, to prevent or weaken public support for the USFL""). "
267,16," It is not clear whether the USFL's use of the word ""disparagement"" in its complaint was intended to reflect that term's narrow 
legal meaning, or whether the USFL was merely using the word as it is commonly used, to refer to ""the expression of a low 
opinion of something."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 653 (1981)."
267,17," In denying the NFL's statement that ""plaintiffs have identified no specific misrepresentation of fact made by any defendant,"" 
NFL Rule 3(g) Statement in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment Dismissing Disparagement Claims P 3, the USFL sets 
forth several examples of NFL ""disparagement."" These examples include aggressive public relations (mailing packets of news 
articles containing criticism of the USFL to members of the media) to ""dirty tricks"" (a scheme to plant embarrassing questions at 
a public forum of college coaches for the purpose of discrediting the USFL). Notwithstanding plaintiffs' tireless recounting of 
""sharp practices"" by defendants, the USFL has presented no evidence, admissible or not, of any specific misstatement of fact by 
defendants concerning the USFL. Clearly, defendants have at times expressed unflattering opinions about the USFL and may 
have even encouraged third parties to do the same. See Segall Affidavit in Opposition to NFL Motion for Summary Judgment on 
Disparagement Claims (""Segall Affidavit""), Exhibits 8 & 9 (ABC's Roone Arledge comparing the network's coverage of USFL 
games to its coverage of the pro bowling tour). But an unkind comparison is not a misrepresentation or a false statement. Other evidence submitted by the USFL on the issue of disparagement is simply besides the point. For instance, the USFL has 
presented evidence to show that an NFL employee, in a league meeting, expressed a willingness to mislead potential pro-
football players about their chances of success in the NFL (in order to discourage them from signing with the USFL). See Segall 
Affidavit, Exhibits 2 & 3. Such a tactic, if carried out, might be regarded as anticompetitive; but it obviously is immaterial to the 
question of whether the NFL has ever made false statements about the USFL."
267,18," This ruling is based, in part, upon the principle that courts should not casually permit antitrust plaintiffs to attack practices 
such as the active solicitation of customers by product comparison, since such practices ""bear a striking similarity to the way a 
competitive firm would ordinarily behave."" General Communications Engineering, Inc. v. Motorola Communications and 
Electronics, Inc., 421 F. Supp. 274, 287 (N.D. Cal. 1976). "
268,19," The NFL has argued at some length that the USFL's allegations regarding the NFL's dissemination of unflattering information 
and opinion cannot state a claim for product disparagement at common law. See NFL Disparagement Memorandum at 16-27. 
Defendants are certainly correct that common law disparagement requires proof of falsity. See, e.g., Sims v. Mack Truck Corp., 
488 F. Supp. 592, 606 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (elementary that disparagement must be false to be actionable); National Dynamics 
Corp. v. Petersen Publishing Co., 185 F. Supp. 573, 575 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (under New York law, declaration that product is not as 
good as a competitor's is actionable only if statement is false). The USFL, however, has not asserted an independent claim for 
common law disparagement."
268,20," In order to evaluate the USFL's allegations concerning game officials in the context of the NFL's motion, it is necessary to 
""ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith 
controverted."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Certainly the manner in which the NFL employs its game officials and the terms of those 
officials' contracts are material to plaintiffs' allegations. These details are set forth in the affidavit of Arthur I. McNally, who has 
been employed by the NFL as its Supervisor of Officials since 1968. McNally Aff. P 1. Except as noted, the USFL has not 
challenged the substance of the McNally affidavit. "
269,21," The USFL has never challenged the substance of this statement, although it has objected to the NFL's characterization of its 
investment in recruiting and training as ""substantial."" See USFL Rule 3(g) Statement in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for 
Partial Summary Judgment at 19."
269,22," According to McNally, the NFL felt that lending its officials to the USFL could have negatively affected the quality and 
reputation of NFL officials in several respects. First, the officials' ability to make split-second decisions in NFL games might 
suffer as a result of being exposed to two sets of game rules. McNally Aff. P 24. Second, an official working with the six-man 
crew used in USFL might develop habits of field-positioning different than those developed by an official working with the seven-
man NFL crew. See id. PP 25-26. Third, the poor performance of non-NFL officials in the USFL might reflect badly on those 
NFL-trained officials working in the same crew, thereby harming the overall reputation of NFL officials. Id. P 27. In addition, the NFL simply did not feel that lending its officials to the USFL was a ""fair"" arrangement, given the NFL's investment 
of time and money in the recruitment and training of its officials. See id. P 28."
269,23," In 1982, at McNally's recommendation, the USFL hired Cal Lepore, then employed as an NFL ""observer,"" as its Supervisor of 
Officials. McNally Aff. P 17. After Lepore had been hired by the USFL, McNally spoke with him at great length about the NFL's 
officiating program. Id. P 18. In addition, the NFL has authorized the USFL to use the NFL's official game rules and officiating 
manual, both of which are authorized. Id. P 19. "
270,24," The USFL rationalizes its token opposition to this part of the NFL's Rule 3(g) statement by denying that plaintiffs have 
separately alleged that the NFL controls any market for ""qualified game officials."" See USFL Rule 3(g) Statement in Opposition 
at 18. Yet even a cursory review of the amended complaint reveals the inaccuracy of such a statement. See AC P 71(c). 
Although this Court has already determined that the USFL has not asserted a distinct claim for the monopolization of the game 
official market, it is quite obvious that the plaintiffs' complaint contains allegations to that effect."
270,25," If such a market definition were accepted, it would lead inexorably to the conclusion that the NFL, as the only professional 
football league in existence immediately prior to the USFL's formation, possessed monopoly power in the qualified game officials 
market. "
271,26," McNally has estimated that, in 1983, there were over 1,400 college officials throughout the United States who satisfied the 
five-and-ten standard. See McNally Aff. P 6. The USFL has never challenged this estimate, and its own supervisor of officials 
has testified that he received somewhere between 1,000 to 2,000 applications for 39 open positions in 1983. See Lepore Dep. at 
131. "
272,27," Assuming that a rule of reason analysis applies to the NFL's refusal to lend,"" the appropriate inquiry is whether the restraint at 
issue is one that promotes competition or one that suppresses competition. See National Society of Professional Engineers v. 
United States, 435 U.S. 679, 691, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978). In forming a judgment about the competitive 
significance of a given restraint, the court must analyze ""the facts peculiar to the business, the history of the restraint, and the 
reasons why it was imposed."" Id. at 692. Although defendants have offered several business reasons for refusing to lend its officials to the USFL, perhaps their most 
basic explanation has been that they simply did not regard such an arrangement to be ""fair,"" given the NFL's investment of time 
and money in the recruitment and training of its officials. See McNally Aff. P 28. In other words, the NFL did not feel obligated to 
accomodate the USFL in the latter's capacity as a ""free-rider."" Significantly, the NFL's position does not appear inconsistent with 
the law of this Circuit. See Konik v. Champlain Valley Physicians Hosp. Med'l Center, 733 F.2d 1007, 1014 (2d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 469 U.S. 884, 105 S. Ct. 253, 83 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1984) (antitrust analysis takes into account that some arrangements 
may be necessary to remedy market imperfections such as the ""free rider"" effect) (citation omitted); see also Berkey Photo, 603 
F.2d at 281 (""If a firm that has engaged in the risks and expenses of research and development were required in all 
circumstances to share with its rivals the benefits of those endeavors, this incentive would very likely be vitiated.""). In this lawsuit, the USFL has alleged certain acts and practices which, if proven, may well require a finding that the NFL has 
violated the antitrust laws. The so-called game officials claim, however, is not of such caliber."
272,28," The USFL has cited the Supreme Court's recent decision in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 
105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985) for the proposition that ""the absence of an unqualified duty to cooperate does not mean 
that every time a firm declines to participate in a particular cooperative venture, that decision may not have evidentiary 
significance, or that it may not give rise to liability under certain circumstances."" Id. at 2856 (emphasis added). The appropriate 
time for the USFL to test the ""evidentiary significance"" language of Aspen Skiing by offering evidence related to game officials 
will be at trial, subject to defendants' possible objections on grounds, inter alia, of relevance and undue prejudice. See Fed. R. 
Evid. 402, 403. "
273,29," With respect to plaintiffs' common law claims, the parties have consistently relied on New York case law. Under these 
circumstances, there is no need to challenge the parties' conviction that New York law applies. See Lehman v. Dow Jones & 
Co., 783 F.2d 285, 294 (2d Cir. 1986)."
273,30," The application of the federal antitrust laws to plaintiffs' allegations regarding game officials has already been discussed. In 
addition, although the parties have not briefed the issue, it seems beyond doubt that a one-year covenant not to compete during 
the employee's term of employment would withstand scrutiny under common law. Cf. Reed, Roberts Associates, Inc. v. 
Strauman, 40 N.Y.2d 303, 353 N.E.2d 590, 386 N.Y.S.2d 677 (1976). "
277,1," We do not feel that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 
(1986), undermines these precedents. As the Supreme Court expressly noted, the Matsushita litigation does not raise issues as 
to the relation between cost and price that justifies an inference of conduct designed to secure monopoly power. Id. at 1355 n.8. 
The Supreme Court's opinion discusses only the amount of evidence required to allow a factfinder to infer the existence of a 
conspiracy punishable under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. This case, of course, arises under section 2, 15 
U.S.C. § 2. "
278,2," The following example illustrates that the ""product"" can be a portion of the total output of production of identical units. Assume 
a seller manufactures widgets, each of which is identical to every other. The selling price is $1.25. Dividing total costs by the 
number of widgets manufactured and sold yields a $1 cost per widget. If production declines because of reduced demand and 
costs remain substantially the same, two things occur: the total cost of each widget increases; and surplus capacity comes into 
existence. To use this capacity the seller-manufacturer may reduce his selling price to all customers in the hope that demand will 
increase and his excess capacity will again become productive. Alternatively, the seller-manufacturer may engage in differential 
pricing, as Brammall has done in this case. That is, it may maintain the $1.25 price to all existing customers but offer widgets at 
50 cents to X, Y, and Z, potentially new customers. Should X, Y, and Z agree to buy widgets at 50 cents, at least a portion of the 
excess capacity will be put back into use. Also it is likely that some costs not related to the then existing surplus capacity will be 
incurred in servicing those three customers. These costs are a portion of the variable costs of the widgets sold to X, Y, and Z. 
Another portion will consist of the difference between the cost of ""using"" the surplus capacity and the cost of permitting that 
capacity to remain idle. But the costs, whatever their nature, incurred in servicing all customers other than X, Y, and Z are not a 
portion of these variable costs. This sort of differential pricing can lead to charges of predatory pricing. To make the charge stick the accuser may assert that the 
price of 50 cents is below the seller-manufacturer's total cost. In our example this would be true. The 50 cents price, however, 
would not be presumptively reprehensible under the antitrust laws, provided it covers the seller's average variable costs. "
279,3," In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), the 
Supreme Court expressly refused to consider whether proof of below-cost pricing is necessary for antitrust liability on a 
predatory-pricing theory. Id. at 1355 n.9. "
280,1," A dispute about what cost categories should be considered variable presents a factual question, which must be decided by the 
jury. See Inglis, 668 F.2d at 1038. "
291,1," The motion for summary adjudication of defendants Wells Fargo Bank and William Van Zile (""Van Zile""), which had been 
noticed for hearing at the same time as the motions to dismiss, was ordered off calendar by the Court."
291,2," The actions of the first three plaintiffs were transferred here from the Northern District of California by the Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation and bear individual docket numbers CV 85-5493 AWT, CV 85-5494 AWT and CV 85-5495 AWT, 
respectively, in this Court. B of A's action, No.  CV 85-1415 AWT, was originally commenced in this Court."
291,3," The Investor Institutions that assigned their claims to Bank of America are: The Seamen's Bank for Savings, Liberty Federal 
Savings and Loan Association, Whitestone Savings and Loan, First Federal Savings of Philadelphia, Irving Savings and Loan 
Association, Columbia Federal Savings Bank, Provident Savings and Loan, Oneonta Federal Savings and Loan Association, 
United Federal Savings Bank of Iowa, Beacon Federal Savings and Loan Association, Bay Ridge Federal Savings, Riverhead "
292,," Savings and Loan, Missouri Savings Association, City Federal Savings and Loan Association, Citizens Federal Savings and 
Loan Association of Cleveland, Anchor Savings Bank FSB, South Weymouth Savings Bank, Richmond Hill Savings Bank and 
Fidelity Savings Association."
292,4," Each of the four complaints which is the subject of a motion to dismiss alleges substantially the same facts as the others. Any 
material differences between the allegations in these complaints will be noted in the course of this recitation."
292,5," NMEC and Feldman are named as defendants in all four complaints, as are Lord, Bissell and Brook, and Leslie W. Michael."
292,6," Advance is the successor in interest to Advance Mortgage Company, Ltd. Neither Advance nor Wells Fargo is named as a 
defendant in B of A's complaint."
292,7," Among the pools for which Wells Fargo acted as trustee are the pools that form the basis of Riverhead's, Missouri's and First 
Federal's complaints."
292,8," Riverhead's, Missouri's and First Federal's complaints also allege representations and omissions on the part of Wells Fargo, 
Advance, and Van Zile (an officer of Wells Fargo). "
293,9," West Pac and Rogers are named as defendants in B of A's complaint.  The Bank alleges that West Pac was the mortgagor on 
a large number of the loans NMEC selected for the mortgage pools. Energy Resources and Weiss are named as third-party and 
crossclaim defendants by Wells Fargo and Van Zile."
293,10," B of A's complaint alleges: Bank of America is the assignee of all claims that exist on behalf of the Investor Institutions, and each of them, against the 
Defendants, and each of them, by reason of certain written agreements entered into between the Bank and the Investor 
Institutions. Plaintiff has succeeded to the claims of the Investor Institutions by operation of law. Comp., para. 6. It is also alleged that in exchange for the Bank's repurchasing of the Certificates or replacing the mortgages 
represented by the Certificates, ""the Investor Institutions assigned to the Bank all interest they had in any properties or mortgage 
insurance securing the NMEC-originated loans."" Comp., para. 55. "
294,11," Because Lord Bissell and Michael are not named as defendants in the breach of contract claim, their motion is not directed 
against that claim.  Therefore, assignment of the contract claim is unchallenged and the Court need not address that issue."
294,12," All further references to the Restatement (Second) of Torts will be cited as the ""Restatement."" Restatement § 885(3) provides: HN2[
] A payment by any person made in compensation of a claim for a harm for which others are liable as tortfeasors 
diminishes the claim against the tortfeasors, at least to the extent of the payment made, whether or not the person making 
the payment is liable to the injured person and whether or not it is so agreed at the time of payment or the payment is made 
before or after judgment."
294,13," Section 900(1)(b) provides that HN3[
] a cause of action for a tort may be discharged by a ""satisfaction."" Comment b, in turn, 
states, ""A satisfaction is the payment made by the tortfeasor or by one acting in behalf of him of an amount that is accepted by 
the injured party as payment in full for his injury. The cause of action is thus discharged, not only for him but for any tortfeasor 
who is liable for same injury."""
294,14," Such a claim clearly is one that arises under state law. HN4[
] Since complete diversity is absent, subject matter jurisdiction 
exists only under this Court's discretionary pendent jurisdiction.  UMW v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 
(1966). By granting leave to amend, I intimate no view on the issue of whether the exercise of pendent jurisdiction would be 
proper here.  Id. at 726. "
295,15," Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 877 states in pertinent part: HN7[
] Where a release . . . or a covenant not to sue . . . is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more 
of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort -- (a) . . . it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release . . . or the covenant. . . ."
295,16," It does not appear that B of A would be entitled to equitable subrogation in this case. Although the Bank's complaint (para. 6] 
states that the Bank has ""succeeded to the claims of the Investor Institutions by operation of law,"" the Bank has not seriously 
pursued that argument. The argument must fail in any event, because HN9[
] under basic subrogation principles, subrogation 
applies only where ""one person is required to pay a debt for which another is primarily responsible."" American Sur., 133 F.2d at 
162 (emphasis added); Restatement of Restitution § 162 (1937). Here, although the Bank contends that defendants are the "
296,," primary wrongdoers, the Bank's own complaint recognizes that it paid off its Investor Institutions in recognition of its own 
responsibilities towards them."
296,17," It is hornbook law that HN12[
] an assignee can acquire no greater right, title or interest than that enjoyed by its assignor. E.g., 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Assignments, § 119; 1 Witkin, Summary of Calif. Law, Contracts § 750, p.627 (8th ed. 1973)."
296,18," This argument fails to recognize that, for obvious reasons, the prohibition against double recovery applies as much to 
assignees of a claimant, as well as to the claimant itself. "
297,19," The Court expresses no opinion at this time as to which claims the Bank would be entitled to seek contribution or indemnity. 
Those questions must await the filing of the amended complaint. "
300,20," B of A has conceded that under California law it cannot pursue punitive damages under the assigned common law fraud 
claims."
300,21," Lord Bissell also argues that antitrust principles should not be applied to RICO because, while RICO is ""penal"" in nature, and 
has ""criminal enforcement goals,"" the antitrust laws are ""regulatory"" in nature, with the ""goals of regulating competition."" This 
argument is derived from a portion of RICO's legislative history referred to in this Court's opinion in Harper v. New Japan Sec. 
Int'l, Inc., 545 F. Supp. 1002, 1005 (C.D. Cal. 1982). However, the antitrust laws, like RICO, provide for criminal penalties.  15 
U.S.C. §§ 3, 24. And RICO, like the antitrust laws, was designed at least partially to promote competition, in RICO's case 
through stemming the infiltration into legitimate businesses by organized crime and by outlawing certain predatory business 
practices. In promulgating RICO, Congress explicitly found that ""organized crime activities . . . weaken the stability of the nation's 
economic system, harm innocent investors and competing organizations [and] interfere with free competition."" 84 Stat. 922-23. 
Thus, the distinction Lord Bissell seeks to draw is illusory. "
301,22," The vitality of this argument has been severely undercut by the Supreme Court's later holding in Sedima that there is no prior 
conviction requirement in bringing a civil RICO claim and its rejection of any organized crime nexus as a requirement.  105 S. Ct. 
at 3282-84. "
302,23," Moreover, even in those circuits which hold that antitrust treble damages are penal, and therefore survive only for actual, not 
treble damages, treble damage claims still are considered assignable. E.g., Second Circuit: compare Vandervelde v. Put & Call 
Brokers & Dealers Ass'n, 344 F. Supp. 118, 156-57 (S.D.N.Y. 1972) (treble damages are a penalty and do not survive for more 
than actual damages), with D'Ippolito v. Cities Serv. Co., 374 F.2d 643, 647 (2d Cir. 1967) (antitrust treble damage claim is 
assignable); Third Circuit: compare Haskell v. Perkins, 28 F.2d 222, 224 (D.N.J. 1928) (treble damages are a penalty and do not 
survive for more than actual damages), with In re Fine Paper Litig., 632 F.2d 1081, 1090 (3d Cir. 1980) (antitrust treble damage 
claim is assignable); Fifth Circuit: compare Rogers v. Douglas Tobacco Bd. of Trade, 244 F.2d 471, 483 (5th Cir. 1957) (treble 
damages are a penalty and action does not survive for more than actual damages), with Jefferson County Pharm. Ass'n, 656 
F.2d at 98 (antitrust treble damage claim is assignable)."
302,24," RICO originally was proposed as an amendment to the Sherman Act, prohibiting the investment or business use of unreported 
income. S. 2048, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) reprinted in part in Techniques at 72-73. The Antitrust Section of the American 
Bar Association urged that RICO be separated from the antitrust laws, in part because the antitrust laws could create obstacles 
to injured persons seeking treble damages. In particular, private litigants would need to contend with antitrust precedents 
creating strict standing and proximate cause requirements. House Hearings on S. 30, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 149 (1970) reprinted 
in part in Techniques at 78-79. See Harper, 545 F. Supp. at 1005, for a brief synopsis."
302,25," The extent and nature of the Bank's participation in the alleged RICO violations may be relevant, assuming it turns out that 
defendants are entitled to raise the defense of ""complete involvement."" See Thi-Hawaii, Inc. v. First Commerce Fin. Corp., 627 
F.2d 991, 995 (9th Cir. 1980). Whether, if defendants can show that the Bank's conduct amounted to ""truly complete 
involvement and participation"" in the alleged RICO violations, the Bank's treble damage claim should be barred, is an issue not 
presently before the Court. "
303,26," As an alternative argument against permitting the Bank to proceed with its RICO claim, Lord Bissell asserts that even if the 
Bank's role in the fraud is discounted and the Bank is considered to be a mere ""unwitting tool"" of a RICO enterprise, the Bank's 
claim still is barred by Cenco, Inc.  v. Seidman & Seidman, 686 F.2d 449, 457 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 880, 74 L. Ed. 2d 
145, 103 S. Ct. 177 (1982). This argument is unavailing. Cenco is a standing case. It holds that the auditor of a criminal 
enterprise lacks standing to bring a cross-claim for damages under RICO against its client, the enterprise. Whether the Bank's 
conduct was witting or unwitting, it cannot be said that as a matter of law it is such a peripheral party that it only ""suffered 
indirectly from the violation."" Id.  Moreover, this argument has no application to the assigned RICO claims."
303,27," It is elemental that HN26[
] dismissal is improper ""unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts 
in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 78 S. Ct. 99 
(1957). "
304,28," Miscellaneous Serv. Workers Local #427 v. Philco-Ford Corp., 661 F.2d 776, 782 (9th Cir. 1981), states that Rule 9(b) 
requires a pleader to set forth the ""time, place and specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the 
parties to the misrepresentation."" However, I do not believe Miscellaneous Serv. Workers states the law of the Circuit. That case 
relied on Gottreich v. San Francisco Inv. Corp., 552 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1977), which in turn, cited the Walling standard. At best, 
therefore, the precise Rule 9(b) standard in this Circuit is unclear. I conclude that the Walling standard is more consistent with 
the theory of the Federal Rules. "

331,7," In Walker Process Justice Harlan stated: It is well also to recognize the rationale underlying this decision, aimed of course at achieving a suitable accommodation in 
this area between the differing policies of the patent and antitrust laws. To hold, as we do, that private suits may be 
instituted under § 4 of the Clayton Act to recover damages for Sherman Act monopolization knowingly practiced under the 
guise of a patent"
331,*, [382 U.S. 172 at 180]
331,*," procured by deliberate fraud, cannot well be thought to impinge upon the policy of the patent laws to encourage inventions 
and their disclosure. Walker Process, supra, at 253. "
332,8," In Walker Process, Justice Harlan stated in his concurring opinion: We hold today that HN6[
] a treble-damage action for monopolization which, but for the existence of a patent, would be violative of § 2 of the Sherman Act may be maintained under § 4 of the Clayton Act if two conditions are satisfied: (1) the 
relevant patent is shown to have been procured by knowing and willful fraud practiced by the defendant on the Patent 
Office or, if the defendant was not the original patent applicant, he had been enforcing the patent with knowledge of the 
fraudulent manner in which it was obtained; and (2) all the elements otherwise necessary to establish a § 2 monopolization 
charge are proved. Walker Process, supra at 253. "
333,9," Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc. was not a Walker Process case.  Plaintiff Handgards did not contend that Ethicon sought to 
enforce a fraudulently procured patent. Instead, Handgards asserts that Ethicon prosecuted infringement actions in bad faith, 
that is, with knowledge that the patents, though lawfully obtained, were invalid. "
334,10," The American Hoist Court ruled: Although an unfortunate choice of words, the Supreme Court in Walker Process, supra, stated that an 'honest mistake' as 
to the effect on patentability of withheld information was merely 'technical' fraud. Several years later, the CCPA erred in its 
use of that term, labeling as 'technical fraud' the proof of all elements of a common law action for fraud.  Norton v. Curtiss, 
433 F.2d 779, 57 CCPA 1384, 167 USPQ 532 (1970). We here endorse the meaning utilized by the Supreme Court, 
although we will attempt to couch future discussion of such claims simply in terms of 'fraud' and 'no fraud.' See American Hoist supra, at 1367."
334,11," The Federal Circuit ruled: It cannot be said that these misrepresentations to the PTO were the result of an honest mistake. See Rohm and Haas v. Crystal Chemical Co., 722 F.2d at 1571. "
335,12," The Federal Circuit Court held: It cannot be said that these misrepresentations to the PTO were the result of an honest mistake. Cf.  Norton v. Curtiss, 57 
C.C.P.A. 1384, 433 F.2d 779, 794, 167 USPQ 532, 544 (CCPA 1970). While direct proof of intent to mislead is normally 
absent, such submissions usually will support the conclusion that the affidavit in which they were contained was the chosen 
instrument of an intentional scheme to deceive the PTO. In any event, proof of the actual state of mind of the applicant or 
persons associated with or representing an applicant is not required. 'The intent element * * * may be proven by a showing 
of acts the natural consequences of which are presumably intended by the actor.' Kansas Jack, Inc. v. Kuhn, 719 F.2d 1144 
at 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Thus, the trial court's assertion that 'what is important' to the fraud inquiry was affiant-inventor 
McRae's actual state of mind was legal error. Question ""1"" must be answered in the affirmative. Rohm and Haas v. Crystal Chemical Company, 722 F.2d at 1571."

352,3," Its predecessor, the Housing Finance Agency, one of several agencies created under the Private Housing Finance Law, N.Y. 
Priv. Hous. Fin. L. §§ 40-61 (McKinney 1976 & Supp. 1986), had powers that were too limited to undertake the high-risk social 
engineering projects envisioned for the UDC. In order to strike directly at physical deterioration, economic stagnation, 
unemployment, and shortages of housing and civic facilities -- which are the roots of urban decay -- the State Legislature 
devised a variation of the public authority theme and built into the UDC nearly absolute operational autonomy. Osborn, New 
York's UDC at 238 n.5 (1977). "
353,4," The district court placed great significance on the legislature's decision to leave to the UDC the decision of whether or not to 
employ competitive bidding. Competitive bidding only dictates that the leases be awarded to the competitor who best meets the 
scoring criteria. Usually price is a pivotal factor. The competitive nature of the bidding is only in regard to the project and does 
not generally contemplate considerations of market competitiveness unless specifically contained in the contest's guidelines. So 
by itself the use of competitive bidding does not mean that antitrust compliance was contemplated. Rather, one can as easily 
argue that in giving the UDC the authority to determine the criteria by which the leases were to be awarded, whether pursuant to 
competitive bidding or not, the legislature clearly envisioned that the UDC could choose to place other values ahead of antitrust 
compliance and award the leases in an anticompetitive manner. For example the UDC could base the award solely on price and 
the highest bidder would win even if that lessee already possessed a large market share. Or the UDC could decide that cultural 
or political considerations mandate selecting a lessee who otherwise might be precluded from winning by the applicable antitrust 
statutes. By itself then the use of competitive bidding is not significant; what is, is the legislature's decision to allow the UDC to 
dictate the criteria for the bidding. Similarly, the legislature's decision to allow the UDC to award leases without any public notice 
or bidding reasonably contemplates that the leases will be awarded in an anticompetitive manner. "

antitrust scrutiny. See California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 513 (1972). As the Second Circuit has

eventually stop providing services (or provide fewer of them) and the automobile manufacturer's desire for point-of-sale 
services will be frustrated.  [Posner, ""Antitrust Policy and the Supreme Court: An Analysis of the Restricted Distribution,

the defendants accepted a bifurcated definition of the market, and therefore defendants are stuck with such a definition. We "

409,6," Indiana law of course is determinative here. The Restatement, however, also suggests that the facts before us cannot support 
a claim of tortious interference with prospective business relations. First, interference with prospective relations requires that 
more blameworthy means be used than does the tort of interference with contractual relations. Thus, ""when the means adopted 
is not innately wrongful . . . the interference is more likely to be found to be not improper."" Restatement of Torts § 766B 
Comment e. The Restatement defines innately wrongful means as those that are tortious themselves. Second, the Restatement 
requires especially egregious means to be employed when a competitor is seeking to expand its business. Thus section 768 
provides: Competition as Proper or Improper Interference (1) One who intentionally causes a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with another who is his 
competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other's relation if (a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and (b) the actor does not employ wrongful means and (c) his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and (d) his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other. "
410,," (2) The fact that one is a competitor of another for the business of a third person does not prevent his causing a breach of 
an existing contract with the other from being an improper interference if the contract is not terminable at will. Although Adelsperger may not be a ""competitor"" of Great Escape in the strictest sense, we think that his position on World 
Wide's advisory board gave him a legitimate interest in promoting its business and thus the general principles applicable to 
competitors should control. "

477,1," Defendants Laborers Local 96 and DuPage County Building Trades do appear to object to the addition of Cleveland as an 
additional plaintiff, see brief in opposition at 9, but offer no reason why that change in any way prejudices them and this court 
sees none. "
478,2," Plaintiff also seems to think its delay is explained by its efforts to settle this case. No timetable of those settlement discussions 
is given, but they could not in any event provide an excuse for a delay this long. "
484,1," Plaintiff's complaint originally charged nine defendants with violating § 1 of the Sherman Act.  15 U.S.C. § 1. These defendants 
included Power Dry, Inc.; Power Dry Patent, Inc.; Drywood Corporation; Compton & Cloer Lumber Co.; General Wood 
Processors, Inc.; European Banking Company, Ltd. (Bank); K. N. Hronopoulos; Delano Compton; and Arthur J. Crowley. Of 
these nine defendants, Drywood and Hronopoulos did not appear in the action in South Carolina and they did not appeal the 
judgments that were entered against them. The seven remaining defendants appealed to this court. While the appeals were 
pending, defendant Bank and defendant Crowley settled all aspects of their litigation with International Wood Processors."
484,2," We should note at this point that the defendants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the state contract claim 
for lost profits. Since this contention rests essentially on the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the antitrust 
damage award, we will consider the contract claim in the context of the broader antitrust conspiracy claim."
484,3," International originally filed this action as a co-plaintiff with John C. Olsen but the district court ruled that Olsen lacked standing 
and directed a verdict against him on all claims. "
485,4," Drywood sublicensees included Inter-Fair Lumber Co., Delano Compton, Frequency Drying International, Ltd. (referred to as 
the Lang license), International Wood Processors, and Mark H. Lazarus (license #1 and #2). "
487,5," International's amended nonexclusive sublicense contained a limitation in the grant clause which conditioned its rights under 
the license. It was required to acquire, own, and operate one RFV kiln within 12 months of the date Drywood either: (a) informs Sublicensee that it, Drywood, stands ready (which must be verifiable) to construct, or contract for the 
construction of [RFV kilns], (b) inform Sublicensee that it, Drywood, is unable for any reason to construct or to contract for 
construction of [RFV kilns], or (c) from the date that Drywood delivers, or notifies Sublicensee that it stands ready to deliver, 
all necessary documents and know-how to Sublicensee so as to allow Sublicensee to construct or contract for the 
construction of [RFV kilns], whichever date first occurs. When Drywood sent plaintiff the letter notifying it that Drywood stood ready to deliver RFV kilns, plaintiff was required by the 
sublicense to submit to Drywood within 60 days of the notification ""suitable documentation to Drywood's satisfaction irrevocably 
guaranteeing financing for the construction of one unit."""
487,6, Plaintiff's sublicense specifically provided:
487,7," .  TRADE SECRETS & KNOW-HOW A.  Drywood shall make available, for the use of Sublicensee, all trade secrets and know-how that Drywood has relating to 
the construction and operation of the Facility and the apparatus and process encompassed within said patent insofar as 
they relate solely to the drying, seasoning and treating of lumber. "
488,," B.  Sublicensee shall forthwith give full information of, and convey to Drywood, any and all trade secrets and know-how 
acquired by Sublicensee relating to the construction and operation of the Facility and the apparatus and process 
encompassed within said patent."
488,7," Of the $4,000,000 financed by the Bank, $3,000,000 was an outright loan ($500,000 of which was designated as a loan to 
Drywood for payment of Crowley Professional legal fees) and the remaining $1,000,000 went toward the purchase of Power Dry 
equity. "
491,8," The jury found that Drywood and Power Dry, as assignee, breached the amended nonexclusive sublicensing agreement by 
failing to provide plaintiff technical information and, additionally, found that the seven other defendants induced the breach. The 
jury also specifically found that the Bank, Compton, and Crowley acted with malice in inducing the breach of the sublicensing 
agreement. On appeal, the defendants do not challenge the jury's findings regarding the validity of plaintiff's sublicense and the 
breach or the inducement of breach of that sublicense by the defendants. Instead, they challenge the jury's determination that 
plaintiff had actual damages in the amount of $200,000 that resulted from the breach of contract. "
493,9," Apparently, between October 1979 and April 1984, General/Venture and its successor Power Dry attempted to sell or lease 
RFV kilns and managed to make only 11 sales during that time period. Eight of the 11 units sold were purchased by one buyer 
and one of the 11 units was sold outside of the United States. Since the parties do not dispute that the relevant geographic 
market for determining the anticompetitive effects is the United States, we will refer only to those 10 units that were sold in the 
United States. "

502,1," A presentation made in 1974 by Dr. David McClure, an Association official and later one of the founders of respondent Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, is revealing as to the motives underlying the dentists' resistance to the provision of x rays for use by 
insurers in making alternative benefits determinations: ""The problems associated with third party programs are many, but I believe the 'Indiana Plan' [i. e., the policy of refusing to 
submit x rays] to be sound and if we work together, we can win this battle.  We are fighting an economic war where the very 
survival of our profession is at stake. ""How long can some of the leaders of dentistry in other states be so complacent and willing to fall into the trap that is being set 
for us.  If only they would take the time, to see from whence come the arrows that are heading in our direction.  The Delta Dental 
Plans have bedded down with the unions and have been a party to setting up the greatest controls that any profession has ever 
known in a free society. . . . ""The name of the game is money.  The government and labor are determined to reduce the cost of the dental health dollar at the 
expense of the dentist. There is no way a dental service can be rendered cheaper when the third party has to have its share of 
the dollar. ""Already we are locked into a fee freeze that could completely control the quality of dental care, if left on long enough."" FTC 
Complaint Counsel's Trial Exhibit CX 372A, F, App. 104."
502,2, Respondent no longer makes any pretense of arguing that it is immune from antitrust liability as a labor organization. 
506,3," Because we find that the Commission's findings can be sustained on this basis, we do not address the Commission's 
contention that the Federation's activities can be condemned regardless of market power or actual effect merely because they 
constitute a continuation of the restraints formerly imposed by the Indiana Dental Association, which allegedly had market power 
throughout the State of Indiana. "
508,4," It is undisputed that lay claims examiners employed by insurance companies have no authority to deny claims on the basis of 
examination of x rays; rather, initial screening of x rays serves only as a means of identifying cases that merit further scrutiny by 
the licensed dentists serving as consultants to the insurers. Any recommendation that benefits be denied or a less expensive 
course of treatment be pursued is based on the professional judgment of a licensed dentist that the materials available to him -- 
x rays, claim forms, and whatever further diagnostic aids he chooses to consult -- are sufficient to indicate that the treating 
dentist's recommendation is not necessary to the health of the patient. There is little basis for concluding that, where such a 
divergence of professional judgment exists, the treatment recommendation made by the patient's dentist should be assumed to 
be the one that in fact represents the best interests of the patient. "
519,1," The truth of this may be easily demonstrated.  When a law firm refuses to hire an applicant there is a concerted refusal to deal 
since the lawyers in the firm are separate legal entities and capable of practicing law independently.  It is also a boycott if the Ivy 
League refuses to admit a new college to membership or the American League refuses to admit a baseball team.  It is no less a 
boycott if any of these groups refuses to deal because the applicant's grades are too low, or its football program has standards "
520,," unacceptable to the Ivy League, or the would-be baseball franchise is currently a slow-pitch softball team in an industrial league.  
A ruling that concerted refusals to deal are per se illegal would mean that Atlas not only must retain carrier agents that compete 
with it but must admit as an agent any trucker who applied regardless of the need for an additional agent, the trucker's financial 
condition, its safety record, or its ability to serve customers. That is what a per se rule means: no group may impose a standard 
of any kind as a condition of dealing.  That nonsensical requirement would destroy all of the groups concerned or force them into 
one ownership in order to claim the immunity of the Copperweld rule."
520,2," Accord Brenner v. World Boxing Council, 675 F.2d 445, 455 (2d Cir.) (suspension of a fight promoter from promoting World 
Boxing Council fights for ""failure to comply with his commitments"") (applying the rule of reason unless the restraint at issue can

precedent concerning the per se rule, see, e.g., Realty Multi-List, 629 F.2d at 1367; see also Part V-C infra at pp. 33-41, some 
relying upon the dicta in Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 348-49, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 (1963), to 
the effect that a group boycott may be justified by reference to the policies of another federal statute ""or otherwise,"" see, e.g., 
Brenner, 675 F.2d at 454, and some relying upon both rationales, see, e.g., Phil Tolkan Datsun, 672 F.2d at 1284-87. The 
proposition that not all concerted refusals to deal are to be treated as per se illegal has found considerable support among 
commentators as well.  See, e.g., L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 89, at 253-56 (1977); 2 J. Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade 
Regulation § 6C.02[2], at 6C-25 to 6C-27 & n.68 (1986); Bauer, Per Se Illegality of Concerted Refusals to Deal: A Rule Ripe for 
Reexamination, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 685 (1979). "
521,3," The interstate household goods industry consists of 1100 to 1300 interstate carriers, of which the 15 largest constitute 70% of 
the market.  These carriers employ roughly 8,000 agents.  Based on data compiled for 1981, Atlas was the sixth largest 
interstate carrier, with a 5.86% market share. The market share tapered gradually, from the largest firm's 13.3% share to Atlas' 
position, after which shares dropped precipitously to 3.19% and 1.99% for the seventh and eighth largest firms. See Plaintiffs' 
Statement of Genuine Issues para. 69, at 97 (""PSGI"").  Thus, the market cannot be said to be heavily concentrated and Atlas is 
by no means a dominant force in the market. "
522,4," HN14[
] The first group of indicia mentioned in Brown Shoe relates to the ability of the consumer to obtain substitutes for a 
product and, therefore, goes directly to the economic criteria that make one market distinct from another.  One factor is ""unique 
production facilities."" If a product requires unique production facilities, and the producer raises the price above the competitive 
level, the ability of other producers to shift resources to make the product would be limited, and the market definition should be 
likewise limited.  ""Distinct prices"" and ""sensitivity to price changes"" also relate directly to the economic definition of a market.  
The first suggests that cross-elasticity of demand is low, the second that it is high. HN15[
] The second set of indicia bear less directly upon the economic definition of a market, representing observations about 
what one ordinarily observes when a market is distinct.  The ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate 
economic"" unit matters because we assume that economic actors usually have accurate perceptions of economic realities.  The 
""product's peculiar characteristics"" refers to the general truth that substitutes in a market often have a strong physical and 
functional relationship.  Both ""distinct customers"" and ""specialized vendors"" may indicate unique product attributes, which refers 
again to the fact that products with distinct physical and functional attributes tend to be priced differently.  These factors may be 
helpful where the other indicia are ambiguous.  See generally 3 J. Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 
8.02[2], at 8-27 (1986) (stating that Brown Shoe does not provide ""a new test"" for determining the relevant market, but merely 
provides ""several new factors"" in discovering ""interchangeability between different products""). "
523,5," Indeed, other statements by plaintiffs demonstrate that there could hardly be such an industry recognition since plaintiffs as a 
group had no common recognition of submarkets. Thus, in support of its claim of a nationwide market, the defendant cited, 
among other things, the deposition of the owner of one of the plaintiff carrier agents.  See Defendant's Statement of Material 
Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute para. 69, at 60; see also Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of 
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment at 62.  This plaintiff testified that the carrier agent is licensed to operate throughout 
the United States, that is trucks will go wherever there is a ""good shipment coming back,"" and that shorter hauls are preferred 
but ""it doesn't work out that way."" Deposition of ""Z"" at 34.  That plaintiff further stated: By geography[,] [a] great part of our business is generated in the local marketplace.  My sales market area is the whole 
world, however.  Id. at 120."
523,6," Though we do not rely upon this observation in reaching our decision, it seems apparent why plaintiffs did not offer evidence of 
real submarkets and why they barely mentioned the point and then in their reply brief only.  In an industry in which the supply of 
the product, space in truck trailers, is among the most mobile factors of production imaginable, and the nature of the business 
causes these factors of production to be constantly moving throughout the country, it is inconceivable that any showing of 
submarkets could be made.  Any attempt in one city to raise prices above competitive levels would be met by other van lines 
sending in trucks and trailers at a lower price.  This view is supported by a plaintiff's deposition testimony.  See supra note 5."

share of every firm in the industry, it is only the marginal or ""fringe"" firms for which we lack data, and the Guidelines explicitly and 
correctly state that ""lack of information about small fringe firms is not critical because such firms do not affect the HHI 
significantly."" Merger Guidelines at 14 n.14."
525,8," The Supreme Court has shown that interbrand competition, which is intense in the van line industry, can prevent the 
manifestation of anticompetitive effects from a firm's internal restraints.  In Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 
36, 52 n. 19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), the Court stated: HN17[
] Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product . . . and is the 
primary concern of antitrust law.  The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where there 
is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors -- wholesale or 
retail -- of the product of a particular manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the 
manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive 
industry.  But when interbrand competition exists, . . . it provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market 
power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product. "
526,9," Rothery's brief has substantially mischaracterized para. V-C of its Statement of Material Undisputed Facts below.  Rothery cites 
this paragraph for the proposition that ""when a carrier agent makes a shipment on its own authority, it uses its own trucks, 
employees, packing materials, and other needed facilities."" Brief for Rothery at 29-30.  In fact, the paragraph cited by Rothery 
does not support this sweeping assertion.  It concedes that the carrier agents pay only ""the bulk . . . costs associated with their 
operations,"" and it admits that Atlas made contributions covering some of the costs of operation.  Nowhere does the cited 
paragraph suggest that contributions made by Atlas to the carrier agents benefited only Atlas shipments and not those 
undertaken for the carrier agents' own accounts.  Indeed, the only part of the cited paragraph that even resembles anything for 
which Rothery cites it is a quotation from the Atlas rules stating that Atlas' operations were to be ""conducted primarily with the 
facilities, drivers, and equipment of the agents of the Company."" See Statement of Material Undisputed Facts in Support of 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Liability para. V-C, at 15.  This amounts to no more than a non-sequitur.  It 
describes the manner by which shipments on Atlas' interstate authority are to be made, and in no way precludes the conclusion 
that Atlas contributes to the carrier agents' business facilities and that those contributions benefit the carrier agents in carriage 
on their own authority and for their own accounts.  It goes beyond acceptable advocacy for Rothery to cite para. V-C for the 
proposition that appears in its brief. "
528,10," A hypothetical was posed as oral argument which seems instructive.  If there were a number of law firms in a given location of 
a size distribution like that of the van lines in this case, the extraction of a promise by each partnership that its members and 
associates not compete with the firm could, by no one's estimation, be construed as running afoul of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Indeed, it is with respect to the legal profession that the law has properly distinguished between lawful ancillary and unlawful 
naked restraints.  Although literally price fixing among competitors, fee schedules imposed by a law partnership are accepted, 
even taken for granted.  Yet in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 (1975), the 
Supreme Court held that a minimum fee schedule applicable to the entire bar of a state violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. Thus, in 
its actual operation, the law has recognized the propriety of horizontal restraints ancillary to an efficiency-producing economic 
integration as distinct from the imposition of such restraints by competitors who have integrated none of their productive 
endeavors. "
533,11," Two additional points should be made.  First, we do not think it significant to the outcome that Atlas' policy allowed agents to 
exercise their own interstate authority through separate corporations.  HN20[
] Once it is clear that restraints can only be 
intended to enhance efficiency rather than to restrict output, the degree of restraint is a matter of business rather than legal 
judgment.  Second, HN21[
] though it is sometimes said that, in the case of restraints like these, it is necessary to weigh 
procompetitive effects against anticompetitive effects, we do not think that a usable formula if it implies an ability to quantify the 
two effects and compare the values found.  Here, there are no anticompetitive effects and so there is nothing to place on that 
side of the scale.  If the underlying contract integration is lawful, i.e., not of such size as to violate the Sherman Act, restraints 
ancillary to the integration, in the sense we have described, should be lawful.  Weighing effects in any direct sense will usually 
be beyond judicial capabilities but predictions about effects may be reflected in rules about allowable size.  The concurrence 
appears to suggest that the district court conducted a balancing of effects in some fashion other than by drawing inferences from 
market share and structure.  If so, the district court did not explain its alternative method and made no findings on the subject.  
Nor does the concurrence articulate an alternative means of weighing procompetitive and anticompetitive effects.  HN22[
] 
Antitrust adjudication has always proceeded through inferences about market power drawn from market shares. See, e.g., 
Consultants & Designers, Inc. v. Butler Service Group, Inc., 720 F.2d 1553, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding under § 1 that 
when a defendant has ""a relatively small portion of the . . . [relevant] market,"" imposition of a restraint cannot be construed 
""impermissibly [to] hurt either . . . competitors or competition""); Smith v. Pro-Football, Inc., 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 
1173, 1185-86 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (applying § 1 and finding the ""predictable effect"" of a restraint imposed by 100% of the teams 
was ""significantly anticompetitive""); United States v. Aluminum Company of America, 148 F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945) (L. Hand, 
J.) (a § 2 case holding that ""[ninety] percent [] is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four 
percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three percent is not""). "
534,1," In Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 
(1985), the Court held that the per se rule of illegality did not apply absent an allegation that the ""cooperative possesses market 
power or unique access to a business element necessary for effective competition."" 105 S. Ct. at 2613. Since the plaintiffs had 
not alleged any such market advantage, the Court remanded for rule of reason analysis. According to the panel's analysis, 
plaintiff's failure to allege market power should have been determinative of the rule of reason injury as well.  Nothing in BMI, 
NCAA, or Pacific Stationery supports the panel's new per se rule of legality."
534,2," Compare Bork, The Antitrust Paradox (1978) (only goal is to increase economic efficiency); R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An 
Economic Perspective (1976) (efficiency is not only important goal, it is the only goal of antitrust law) with Pitofsky, The Political 
Content of Antitrust, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1051 (1979) (antitrust laws promote political values including fear of excessive 
concentration of economic power and a desire to enhance individual and business freedom); Schwartz, ""Justice"" and Other Non-
Economic Goals of Antitrust, 127 Pa. L. Rev. 1076, 1076 (1979) (""putative economic gains should not be the exclusive or 
decisive factors in resolving antitrust controversies""); Lande, Wealth Transfers as the Original and Primary Concern of Antitrust: 
The Efficiency Interpretation Challenged, 32 Hastings L.J. 65, 68 (1983) (""Congress passed the antitrust laws to further 
economic objectives, but primarily objectives of a distributive rather than of an efficiency nature""); see generally Symposium: The 
Goals of Antitrust: A Dialogue on Policy, 65 Colum. L. Rev. 33 (1965)."
534,3," I do not think that Reiter v. Sonotone, 442 U.S. 330, 343, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979), answers the question.  
There, the Court was asked to decide whether consumers who purchase goods for their own use have standing to sue under 
section 4 of the Clayton Act.  It is thus hardly surprising that the Court answered the question by saying that the floor debates 
suggest that Congress designed the Sherman Act as a ""consumer welfare prescription."" Id. Moreover, even if one thinks that the 
Court intended to exclude all other considerations, the phrase ""consumer welfare"" surely includes far more than simple 
economic efficiency."
534,4," I am also somewhat troubled by the panel's statement that ""once it is clear that restraints can only be intended to enhance 
efficiency rather than to restrict output, the degree of restraint is a matter of business rather than legal judgment."" Pan. op. at 
229 n.11.  I understand the panel's position to be that the breadth of the restraint is a matter to be analyzed in determining 
whether the restraint is ancillary in the first place.  See Pan. op. slip op. at 29-30.  If the restraint is not ancillary, it is a naked 
restraint, subject to the per se rule of illegality. "
535,5," Although both of these examples involve the Court's balancing of potential procompetitive virtues against a market power 
presumption of anticompetitiveness, the panel's argument that genuine balancing is technically impossible would seem to apply 
there as well."
535,6," In addition to my doctrinal difficulties with the panel's approach, I am also concerned about its heavy reliance on the 6% figure 
representing Atlas' share of the national market for intercity transport of used household goods.  Although the panel concludes 
that the national market was not sufficiently contested as the only relevant market to establish a genuine issue of fact, the fact 
remains that the exclusivity of that market was indeed contested before the District Court and the District Court made no findings 
on the issue.  Conceding that the national market was a relevant market, plaintiffs went on to explain that within the national market, there are product submarkets of new and used household goods shipments and submarkets 
divided according to the type of shipment, including national account, government and c.o.d. shipments, and including long-
haul and short-haul shipments. Geographically, markets are national, regional and local. Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [hereinafter ""Plaintiffs' Opposition""] at 53-
60.  Plaintiffs produced affidavits and other evidence, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), for the proposition that these were separate

30% and 40%, and in one large geographic market, 60%.  Deposition of ""Y"" at 68; see generally Plaintiffs' Opposition at 53-60. The panel today holds that such affidavits and evidence are not sufficient to establish that the existence of submarkets is a 
genuine issue.  It fails to explain just how detailed the evidence of submarkets must be to withstand a defendant's motion for 
summary judgment, but creates the distinct impression that plaintiffs' proof of such markets must be substantial and 
comprehensive indeed. "

555,1," Although Plaintiff alleges in its Memorandum that Defendant engaged in price-fixing, it nowhere mentions price-fixing in the 
remaining antitrust counts. Plaintiff alleged price-fixing in Count I, which it has subsequently withdrawn. Plaintiff's arguments 
concerning price-fixing and the cases cited therein are therefore relevant only as evidence that Defendant's refusal to deal 
carried an unlawful intent."

556,3," In fact, this Court doubts whether an unwilling co-conspirator can ever exist in a refusal to deal case. While a distributor may 
sometimes be placed in in the awkward position of agreeing to fix prices in order to obtain a manufacturer's business, it is 
extremely difficult, if not totally impossible, to acquire business by agreeing not to deal with oneself."

violations of Section 1."
557,6," Intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular 
manufacturer; interbrand competition is competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product, and is the primary 
concern of antitrust law."
557,7," In fact, scholars in the field have argued that vertical restrictions should be per se legal. See Bork, ""Vertical Restraints: Schwinn 
Overruled,"" 1977 Supreme Court Rev. 171, 181; Posner, ""The Next Step in the Antitrust Treatment of Restricted Distribution:

585,1," Because the two views of the verdict ultimately lead to a divergence with respect to the amount of the Raiders' benefits that 
should be offset against their damages, it is necessary to decide which interpretation of the liability verdict is correct. See infra at 
slip op. p. 26. However, we discuss both alternatives in order to more clearly illustrate the parameters of the two offset theories 
at issue in this case."

82). "
589,7," In footnote 1 of her dissenting opinion, Judge Nelson suggests that our offset analysis is dependent upon an assumption that 
the NFL would have charged the Raiders for the excess value represented by the Los Angeles opportunity. However, this 
assumption is raised only as an alternative to our primary holding, that the relief awarded the Raiders is beyond the scope of the 
adjudicated antitrust liability, and for that reason should be offset. "
590,8," Judge Nelson asserts that our calculation of damages improperly omits the ""residual"" value of the difference in worth between 
the Los Angeles and Oakland opportunities (the ""b"" value from Hanover Shoe). To the extent that our decision is based on the 
hypothetical ""outlay"" of the Raiders to obtain the benefits of moving to Los Angeles (see footnote 7), there is simply no ""residual"" 
value present in this case which is analogous to the ""b"" value in Hanover Shoe. In Hanover Shoe, it was appropriate to reduce ""a"", the expenditures the plaintiff was able to avoid because of defendant's 
insistence on leasing the shoe machinery, by the portion of ""a"" which remained in plaintiff's hands at the conclusion of the 
damage period (i.e., ""b"", the residual value of the machines). This was because ""a"" by itself did not accurately reflect the 
plaintiff's actual outlay to purchase equipment; plaintiff's net outlay was the initial purchase price less the value of the machinery 
remaining in plaintiff's hands at the conclusion of the damage period. We can see no similar residual value remaining in the 
Raiders' hands as of 1982. The ""residual value"" identified by Judge Nelson, the difference between the 1982 values of the Los 
Angeles and Oakland opportunities, does not represent any value retained by the Raiders from their hypothetical outlay to 
acquire the Los Angeles opportunity. There is thus no reason to subtract that value from ""a"" to arrive at the Raiders' net outlay. 
To the extent that the 1982 value of the Los Angeles opportunity is relevant at all, it pertains to the question of the increase in 
value of that opportunity from 1980-82. That issue is dealt with in the following paragraph. Judge Nelson also suggests that our analysis fails to take into account the extent to which the value of the Los Angeles 
opportunity increased from 1980 to 1982, relative to the value of the Oakland opportunity. On the contrary, this value is 
encompassed in the injunction awarded by the district court, which provided the Raiders with the full value of the Los Angeles 
opportunity as of 1982. Note that the increase in value of that opportunity from 1980 to 1982 is awarded by way of the jury's 
calculations of lost profits for those years. "
591,1," The majority's assessment of damages rests upon an assumption, neither pleaded nor proved by the NFL, that the League 
actually would have charged the Raiders the difference between the 1980 values of the Los Angeles and Oakland opportunities. 
I base much of my dissent on the same assumption, but note that I would require the NFL to plead and prove that fact on 
remand. In this connection, I am puzzled by the majority's contention that its so-called ""primary"" holding does not assume that the NFL 
would have charged the Raiders for the move. See ante at n. 7. If the NFL would not have charged the Raiders for this move, I 
see no way that the relief awarded could have been considered beyond the scope of the adjudicated antitrust liability. "
592,2," For the sake of clarity, I have taken what the district court in Hanover Shoe called ""S"", and incorporated it into ""a""."
592,3," In its footnote 8, the majority offers no support for the contention that the difference in worth between the Los Angeles and 
Oakland opportunities has no ""residual"" value in 1982. Indeed, by deducting the 1980 value of the Oakland opportunity from the 
1980 value of the Los Angeles opportunity before offsetting, the majority implicitly acknowledges that the Oakland opportunity 
had a ""residual"" value in 1980. Following the majority's reasoning, I find it inexplicable that the Los Angeles opportunity would 
not similarly possess a ""residual"" value in 1982. In the majority's own words: Unquestionably, when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, they appropriated for themselves the expansion value that had 
accumulated in Los Angeles. Although by moving out of Oakland the Raiders ""gave back"" an expansion opportunity [i.e., a 
residual value] to the NFL, the uncontradicted testimony at trial showed the Los Angeles market to be a significantly more 
lucrative franchise opportunity. Ante at slip op. p. 30. In short, the majority's footnote 8 is inconsistent with its own offset calculation in the body of the opinion. "
593,4," That is to say, the majority overestimates the net outlay (a-b) the Raiders would have had to make in securing the financial 
advantages of the Los Angeles opportunity from 1980 to 1982."
593,5," Here, I am referring to all lost financial advantages other than the increase in the value of the opportunities as reflected in the 
calculation of ""a"" and ""b""."
593,6," Contrary to the majority's assertion in footnote 8 of its opinion, it is not at all apparent that the jury's award included both 
elements of damages."
593,7," In arriving at its assessment of pre-trebled damages, the court actually calculated the net value of the business as of the time of 
trial, added the monies distributed to the conspirator's stockholders during the violation period, and then subtracted the monies 
expended by its stockholders during that time.  594 F. Supp. at 861. Because the difference between monies expended and 
distributed accounts for both the price the plaintiff would have paid for the franchise when it was sold to the conspirator, and its 
net profit or loss during the violation period, the court's calculation of damages was exactly as I propose here. "
594,8," Even were we to find Rule 4.3 illegal per se, I question the majority's dicta that Perma-Life supports offsetting the value of a 
remedy before trebling. The majority's view seems to be a significant extension, unsupported by any authority of which I am 
aware, of the offhandedly expressed Perma-Life principle. Indeed, Perma-Life is most often cited in support of vigorous private 
enforcement of the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 745, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 
(1977). The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that an antitrust plaintiff may recover only for ""antitrust injury, which is to 
say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts 
unlawful."" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977) (emphasis 
added). In other words, only detriments and benefits which flow from the antitrust violation itself should enter into the calculation 
of antitrust damages. Since it appears that any ""benefits"" derived by the Raiders flowed directly from the remedy, and not from 
the NFL's antitrust scheme, it seems inappropriate to apply a Perma-Life offset before trebling the damages."
594,9," One can appreciate the fairness of offsetting after trebling in the present case by examining the implications of a slight variation 
of the facts. What if the Raiders had not sought injunctive relief? In that case, there would be no question of offsetting the value 
of an equitable remedy. First, the Raiders would receive three times their actual antitrust damages (i.e., three times the lost 
financial advantages between 1980 and 1982). Only afterwards would the court prevent the ongoing antitrust violation by 
prohibiting the restraint of the move, but permitting the NFL to charge the Raiders for the value of the move. In a sense, the mistake the majority commits can be characterized as one of blurring together the distinct benefits conferred by 
the injunction. First, the injunction prevented an ongoing antitrust violation. Second, it effectively conferred upon the Raiders the 
value of the 1982 difference in worth between the Los Angeles and Oakland opportunities, for which the Raiders might have 
otherwise been charged. The remedy in this case should have been the trebled value of the lost financial advantages plus the 
right to purchase the opportunity to play football in Los Angeles. The amount to which the NFL was entitled incident to the move, 
improperly conferred upon the Raiders, can be returned; but to return this amount, the Raiders need only return it once, after 
trebling. Offsetting before trebling would result in a treble return for an improper remedy that was only once received."

(1972), the offset flowed from the violation. "
595,11," Obviously, this rule applies only when all of the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the antitrust damages."

a competitor statute; and North Carolina's version of the Robinson-Patman Act."
610,3," By stipulation of the parties, the following causes of action asserted by the plaintiff are dismissed with the same force and effect 
as if dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: a. common law claim of defamation; b. claim predicated on N.C.Gen.Stat. § 75-5(b)(2); c. claim predicated on N.C.Gen.Stat. § 75-5(b)(4); and d. claim predicated on N.C.Gen.Stat. § 75-5(b)(5). Furthermore, plaintiff has abandoned its claims under N.C.Gen.Stat. §§ 75-1.1 and 75-5(b)(3) as they relate to conduct 
surrounding plaintiff's Casa Grande batt insulation products. Therefore, these claims, with respect to the Casa Grande operation, 
are also dismissed with the same force and effect as if dismissed with prejudice."
610,4," Defendant's counterclaim is predicated upon Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act -- false advertising of one's own product and the 
common law claim of unfair competition. "
613,5," These quality problems continued to plague the company for at least another four years. In 1983, in an attempt to improve the 
efficiency and operation of his plants, Gould hired a retired executive from United States Gypsum, a competing manufacturer of 
rockwool, to serve as a consultant."
613,6," In mid-1979, Rockwool Industries, a competitor of Spring Hope, had begun selling its rockwool loosefill to manufactured 
housing customers primarily on the west coast. "
618,7," Plaintiff does not contend that § 75-1.1 or any other North Carolina law applies to the ""site built housing"" portion of the case, 
which is based on conduct directed toward insulation contractors in the Western United States at a time when Casa Grande 
Rockwool was an Arizona corporation.  Plaintiff's case in that regard is predicated upon the Lanham Act, and the common law of 
disparagement and unfair competition. Hence the court's discussion of the applicability of the North Carolina General statutes to 
plaintiff's cause of action is pertinent only to the ""manufactured housing"" portion of the case. "
621,8," Where plaintiff's injury occurred, in a legal sense, is not at all self-evident. On the one hand, defendant's alleged conduct 
caused plaintiff to lose the business of customers in many different states. On the other hand, all those lost sales injured plaintiff 
at its place of business in North Carolina, where it experienced reduced profits. Courts disagree as to whether injury occurs 
where business is lost or at the plaintiff's business where profits are lost. Compare American Eutectic Welding Alloys Sales Co.  
v. Dytron Alloys Corp., 439 F.2d 428, 435 (2d Cir. 1971) (injury occurs where business lost) with Engine Specialties, Inc. v. 
Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 983, 100 S. Ct. 2964, 64 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1980); 449 U.S. 
890, 101 S. Ct. 248, 66 L. Ed. 2d 116 (""the place of injury is where plaintiff suffered the harm, i.e., at its place of business . . . .""). The North Carolina law of where injury occurs for choice of law purposes is unclear. In applying lex loci in Santana, the Fourth 
Circuit concluded that the Missouri plaintiff's injury had occurred in California where the defendant's last act of misconduct had 
taken place.  674 F.2d at 273. More recently, however, in applying the North Carolina lex loci rule, the Fourth Circuit has stated Manifestly, the injuries sustained by [plaintiff], a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in North 
Carolina, were sustained in the state of North Carolina. Itco Corp., 722 F.2d at 49-50 n.11 (citation omitted). Moreover, HN11[
] in applying the North Carolina long-arm statute, N.C.Gen.Stat. § 1-75.4(4), which applies to conduct occurring outside the state that causes injury in the state, federal courts 
have held that multistate tortious conduct injures a plaintiff at its principal place of business where it loses profits. See Vishay 
Intertechnology, Inc. v. Delta International Corp., 696 F.2d 1062, 1067-68 (4th Cir. 1982); Munchak Corp. v. Riko Enterprises, 
Inc., 368 F. Supp. 1366, 1371 (M.D.N.C. 1973). Although, as herein found, lex loci does not govern this case, the place of 
plaintiff's injury is nonetheless relevant to the choice of law. See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 145(2)(a). "
622,9," In a footnote in Itco Corp., 722 F.2d at 49-50 n.11, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals followed Lloyd v. Carnation Co. in 
applying lex loci to an unfair trade practices claim. Apparently, at the time of its decision in Itco the court was not yet aware of 
the North Carolina Court of Appeals' decision two months previously in Michael v. Greene; Andrew Jackson had not yet been 
decided. No reference was made to the Fourth Circuit's lengthy discussion in Santana of the possible application by the North 
Carolina Supreme Court of a ""most significant relationship test"" in the unfair trade practices context. Given the North Carolina 
Court of Appeals' abandonment of the lex loci rule applied in Lloyd, the Itco footnote would not appear to be controlling. "

consumers into believing that Body on Tap was competitively superior."" 661 F.2d at 278. Finally, in U-Haul International, Inc., certain descriptions by defendant Jartran about its services in comparison to those of U-

634,16," Compare Devitt and Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, §§ 80.18, 80.19, § 90.31. "
636,17," In its brief in support of the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff accurately set forth a brief review of the terms and concepts 
involved in thermal insulation testing and labeling: The thermal performance of insulation products is typically advertised in terms of R-value, or resistance to heat flow. R-
value is a mathematical function of the thickness (T) and thermal conductivity (K) of the material.  Specifically, R-value is 
directly related to thickness and inversely related to thermal conductivity: as thickness increases, so does R-value; as "
637,," thermal conductivity decreases, R-value increases. Thermal conductivity is measured using equipment and procedures 
specified in the American Society for Testing and Materials' (""ASTM"") Annual Book of Standards and varies with the density 
of the material. (In the ranges relevant to the issues herein thermal conductivity and R-value improve as the density of the 
material increases.) To label a loosefill insulation product, the manufacturer must determine a density at which the product can realistically be 
installed (""label density""). After determining (through testing) the thermal conductivity of the material at that density, the 
manufacturer can calculate the thickness of material needed to provide various R-values. The manufacturer can then 
calculate how many bags of loosefill material are necessary to insulate a given area to various thicknesses and R-values. Like other insulation manufacturers, American Rockwool provides customers with labels, coverage charts and other 
literature which indicate, among other things, the minimum thicknesses and the number of bags of material required to 
achieve various R-values for a given area. It is this product literature disseminated by American Rockwool which Owens-
Corning contends is false or misleading. Plaintiff's Memorandum at 5. (citations omitted)."
637,18," A coverage test is designed to determine if a product will cover a specified area of a ceiling at the thickness and density 
represented on the bag label."
637,19, A thermal test is designed to determine the thermal performance capability of a given insulation product.
637,20," 16 C.F.R. § 460.12 HN43[
] requires manufacturers of insulation to label their products with respect to R-value (thermal performance) and other characteristics. Section 460.8 HN44[
] requires that the R-value of any insulation sold by 
manufacturers and other industry members not be more than ten percent below the R-value shown on the manufacturer's label 
or other promotional material."
637,21," As previously indicated, defendant's counterclaim also asserts a claim for unfair competition under the common law. The 
factual basis for this claim is identical to the Lanham Act claim: i.e., defendant contends that plaintiff's labels and advertising 
contained material false statements that deceived or tended to deceive certain manufactured housing accounts, and that such 
deception caused these customers to purchase plaintiff's insulation for ceilings as opposed to defendant's insulation. Therefore, 
as stated by the defendant in its response to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Owens-Corning's unfair competition claim 
duplicates the Lanham Act claim and it rises or falls on the same grounds. "
638,22," Defendant maintains that in order to conduct the tests as to the density and thermal performance of plaintiff's loosefill 
products, defendant obtained 16 lots of plaintiff's loosefill insulation through purchases by field personnel. These purchases 
allegedly occurred over a period from October, 1983 to October, 1985. Eight lots were produced at plaintiff's facility in Spring 
Hope, North Carolina; and eight lots were produced at plaintiff's facility in Casa Grande, Arizona. These lots in turn were shipped 
to Owens-Corning's Technical Center in Granville, Ohio, for the thermal and coverage testing. "

664,3," In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 351 (1974), this Court summarized who will be considered to be a public figure to 
whom the New York Times standards will apply: HN2[
] ""[The public figure] designation may rest on either of two alternative bases.  In some instances an individual may 
achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.  More commonly, 
an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a 
limited range of issues.  In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions."" The District Court found that respondents, as political lobbyists, are the second type of political figure described by the Gertz 
court -- a limited-purpose public figure. See also Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., 201 U. S. App. D. C. 301, 306, 627 
F.2d 1287, 1292, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 898 (1980). "
666,4," Our analysis here does not address the question of the initial burden of production of evidence placed by Rule 56 on the party 
moving for summary judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, post, p. 317.  Respondents have not raised this issue here, and for 
the purposes of our discussion we assume that the moving party has met initially the requisite evidentiary burden."
666,5," This requirement in turn is qualified by Rule 56(f)'s provision that summary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party 
has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition.  In our analysis here, we assume that both 
parties have had ample opportunity for discovery."
666,6," In many cases, however, findings are extremely helpful to a reviewing court. "
669,7," Our statement in Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 120, n. 9 (1979), that proof of actual malice ""does not readily lend itself 
to summary disposition"" was simply an acknowledgment of our general reluctance ""to grant special procedural protections to 
defendants in libel and defamation actions in addition to the constitutional protections embodied in the substantive laws."" Calder 
v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 790-791 (1984). "
670,1," The Court's holding today is not, of course, confined in its application to First Amendment cases.  Although this case arises in 
the context of litigation involving libel and the press, the Court's holding is that ""in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the 
judge must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden."" Ante, at 254.  Accordingly, I 
simply do not understand why JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting, feels it appropriate to cite Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 
(1984), and to remind the Court that we have consistently refused to extend special procedural protections to defendants in libel 
and defamation suits.  The Court today does nothing of the kind.  It changes summary judgment procedure for all litigants, 
regardless of the substantive nature of the underlying litigation. Moreover, the Court's holding is not limited to those cases in which the evidentiary standard is ""heightened,"" i. e., those in which 
a plaintiff must prove his case by more than a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Presumably, if a district court ruling on a 
motion for summary judgment in a libel case is to consider the ""quantum and quality"" of proof necessary to support liability under 
New York Times, ante, at 254, and then ask whether the evidence presented is of ""sufficient caliber or quantity"" to support that 
quantum and quality, the court must ask the same questions in a garden-variety action where the plaintiff need prevail only by a 
mere preponderance of the evidence.  In other words, today's decision by its terms applies to all summary judgment motions, 
irrespective of the burden of proof required and the subject matter of the suit. "
671,2," Writing in dissent in Matsushita, JUSTICE WHITE stated that he agreed with the summary judgment test employed by the 
Court, namely, that ""'[where] the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, 
there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'"" 475 U.S., at 599. Whether the shift, announced today, from looking to a ""reasonable"" rather 
than a ""rational"" jury is intended to be of any significance, there are other aspects of the Matsushita dissent which I find difficult 
to square with the Court's holding in the present case.  The Matsushita dissenters argued: "". . . [The] Court summarizes Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., supra, as holding that 'courts should not permit 
factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible. . . .' Ante, at 593.  Such language suggests that a judge 
hearing a defendant's motion for summary judgment in an antitrust case should go beyond the traditional summary judgment 
inquiry and decide for himself whether the weight of the evidence favors the plaintiff.  Cities Service and Monsanto do not stand 
for any such proposition.  Each of those cases simply held that a particular piece of evidence standing alone was insufficiently 
probative to justify sending a case to the jury.  These holdings in no way undermine the doctrine that all evidence must be 
construed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. ""If the Court intends to give every judge hearing a motion for summary judgment in an antitrust case the job of determining if the 
evidence makes the inference of conspiracy more probable than not, it is overturning settled law.  If the Court does not intend 
such a pronouncement, it should refrain from using unnecessarily broad and confusing language."" Id., at 600-601 (footnote 
omitted). In my view, these words are as applicable and relevant to the Court's opinion today as they were to the opinion of the Court in 
Matsushita. "
672,3," I am also baffled by the other cases cited by the majority to support its holding.  For example, the Court asserts that ""[if] . . . 
evidence is merely colorable, Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U.S. 82 (1967) (per curiam), . . . summary judgment may be 
granted."" Ante, at 249-250.  In Dombrowski, we reversed a judgment granting summary judgment to the counsel to the Internal 
Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate because there was ""controverted evidence in the 
record . . . which affords more than merely colorable substance"" to the petitioners' allegations.  387 U.S., at 84. Dombrowski 
simply cannot be read to mean that summary judgment may be granted if evidence is merely colorable; what the case actually "
673,," says is that summary judgment will be denied if evidence is ""controverted,"" because when evidence is controverted, assertions 
become colorable for purposes of motions for summary judgment law. "
684,1," ""Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees with the Employer that the provisions of this paragraph 10 are fair and 
reasonable; that the same are reasonably necessary to provide Employee with greater responsibility, greater trust and an 
opportunity for increasing Employee's knowledge and experience, as part of the employment relationship between Employee

684,2," Mascari did not contest his termination beyond testifying that he received no remuneration for helping set up the

that savings could be effectuated, but that this had been rejected by Ciruli. "

690,6," While some courts have moved away from the blue-pencil rule, some of the reasons for doing so seem debatable.  See 
Raimonde v. Van Vlerah, 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 325 N.E.2d 544 (1975). Professor Blake appears to take the view that the blue-
pencil rule encourages covenants of ""truly ominous"" in terrorem effect, 73 Harv.L. Rev. at 682-683, but it would seem that the 
rule requires an employer's counsel to focus upon a bottom line of post-serverance validity and that the burden is placed upon 
counsel rather than the court to fashion a legitimate restriction.  A covenant exacted other than in good faith would be subject to 
attack on that basis alone.  See Lassen v. Benton, supra at 86 Ariz. 328, 346 P.2d at 140."

706,5," In addition, the dissent would require a trial over the purpose of a subcontracting clause even though the issue is not 
specifically raised by the defendant, or if raised, no proof of impermissible purpose is submitted in response to a motion for 
summary judgment. Such a requirement would needlessly encourage litigation, and would tend to thwart the apparent intent of 
Congress in enacting the section 8(e) proviso."
706,6," The dissent contends that the argument presented by Sun-Land is not that ""the contract language is sufficient to create liability; 
it merely urges that the contract language is not sufficient to insulate the defendants from liability."" Infra at 1120. [Dissent 6-7] 
We disagree. The issue on appeal was clearly stated by Sun-Land itself in its opening brief: ""Whether the challenged 'particular 
union' subcontracting restrictions violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act irrespective of whether or not they are valid under 
section 8(e) of the Labor Act."" "
709,1, The district court first held that it had jurisdiction over Sun-Land's claims. The defendants do not appeal that ruling.
709,2," The ""Joint Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Issues of Law Re Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment"" misstates this 
issue as ""Whether or not the subcontracting clauses . . . are violative of Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act."" (ER 55, 6:14-16) 
Thus stated, the issue would be a sloppy repetition of the Sherman Act issue stated immediately thereafter (ER 55, 6:17-20). "

consideration may have had different reasons for voting to rehear the case. We have no formal mechanism for granting 
rehearing on specific issues. At most, we may request parties to brief specific issues, and we made no such request in this case. 
On the contrary, we have denied the appellant leave to brief this very issue, on which the majority bases its decision. See infra."
711,5," The issue was raised below in Sun-Land's cross-motion for summary judgment. Sun-Land in effect argued that the contract 
language created a rebuttable presumption of antitrust liability as a matter of law, regardless of whether the language was valid 
under the construction proviso. Because the defendants had failed to present any evidence that the disputed clause was the 
least restrictive means of accomplishing the defendants' legitimate objectives, Sun-Land argued, Sun-Land was entitled to 
summary judgment. The district court denied Sun-Land's motion, and that denial is not appealed from. "

713,8," For example, Sun-Land points out that its wages, hours, and working conditions were the same for the new union as they had 
been when its employees were represented by the Teamsters, suggesting that the subcontracting clause was not related to the

and to dismiss the RICO claim for failure to plead the underlying fraud with particularity. The exchange defendants move to dismiss all claims asserted against them on the ground that the complaint fails to allege bad 
faith sufficiently.  They also move to dismiss all claims asserted against the clearinghouses on the ground that the complaint fails 
to state any claim upon which relief may be granted. Specifically, the exchange defendants move to dismiss the CEA claims 
asserted against them as barred by the applicable statute of limitations, for failure to state a claim against exchanges and 
clearinghouses on or through which plaintiff did not trade, for failure to plead the elements of either a CEA Section 4b or 4c 
violation, and for failure to plead fraud with particularity. The same defendants also move to dismiss the antitrust claims on 
grounds of plaintiff's lack of ""antitrust standing,"" the exchanges' ""antitrust immunity,"" and the failure of the amended complaint 
sufficiently to allege the exchange defendants' participation in a conspiracy. MACE moves to dismiss the CEA and antitrust claims asserted against it for lack of personal jurisdiction and for improper venue. 
MACE moves specifically to dismiss the CEA claims as barred by the applicable statute of limitations, for failure to sufficiently 
allege bad faith, for failure to plead the elements of either a CEA Section 4b or 4c violation, and for failure to plead fraud with the

and RICO claims asserted against him for failure to state a claim and plead fraud with particularity. "
755,5," The 1982 amendment creating in CEA § 22 an express right of action with a two-year statute of limitations included the caveat 
that ""the enactment of [the amendment] shall not affect any right of any parties which may exist with respect to causes of action 
accruing prior to [January 11, 1983]."" CEA § 22(d), 7 U.S.C. § 25(d). Even in the face of this non-retroactivity provision, it is 
proper under certain circumstances for a court to consider the 1982 statute in ascertaining Congress' intent as to earlier 
provisions of the CEA. See de Atucha v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 608 F.2d 510 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (citing Sam Wong & Son, 
Inc. v. New York Mercantile Exchange, 735 F.2d 653, 676 n.30 (2d Cir. 1984)). "
756,6," The same considerations would apply to determine the place where plaintiff's causes of action under CEA §§ 5(d), 5a(8) and 
9(b) accrued, even though fraud is not an ingredient of those violations of the commodities laws. See Sack v. Low, 478 F.2d at 
366 n.2 (violation of Regulation T of federal securities laws). "
757,7," Plaintiff does not suggest other New Jersey and Illinois rules of limitation which would more appropriately govern her CEA 
claims. We note in this regard that although several decisions by federal district courts sitting in Illinois have employed the Illinois 
blue sky limitations period to govern CEA claims, neither party has referred us to any decisions in which courts selected an 
analogous New Jersey statute of limitations. There are, however, decisions by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the 
federal district court in New Jersey that have considered the question of which New Jersey rule of limitation should be applied to 
claims brought under the federal securities laws. In Roberts v. Magnetic Metals Co., 611 F.2d 450 (3d Cir. 1979), Judge Gibbons writing for the court held that New Jersey's six-
year statute of limitations for common law fraud should be applied in preference to the two-year blue sky limitations period to a 
federal securities claim that could not have been brought under the state's blue sky law.  Id. at 451-56. Judge Sloviter, although 
concurring in the result, stated separately that the concurrent operation of federal and state securities laws would in ordinary circumstances lead us to the application of the statute of limitations provisions in the state securities act, 
i.e. the two-year limitation period in the New Jersey blue sky law. That would seemingly supply the provision most 
consonant with and complementary to that of the federal scheme. Id. at 459. Judge Seitz, dissenting, stated that a federal ""court should look to the state statute that addresses the same 
regulatory area. If the state as part of that regulatory scheme, enacts a statute of limitations, then that statute should govern 
federal claims."" Id. at 461. The only New Jersey federal district court apparently to have addressed this issue in a published 
opinion, see Corson v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., 537 F. Supp. 1263 (D.N.J. 1982), leaned toward the middle ground of the 
Roberts concurrence: The more appropriate inquiry concerns whether the plaintiff is a member of the group protected by the remedy provisions of 
the state statute and whether the conduct of the defendant complained of under § 10(b) is of a type generally proscribed by 
the state statute and actionable thereunder."
757,*," * * To hold otherwise, to differentiate among potential causes of actions by buyers under 10(b), runs the risk of unduly 
complicating the determination of the limitation issue. "
758,537," F. Supp. at 1266-67. It is not clear from these decisions how a federal court sitting in New Jersey would determine the limitations issue presented in 
the instant case.  The issue of which New Jersey limitations period properly applies to claims brought under the federal 
commodities laws has never been considered by either the New Jersey district court or the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and 
we decline at this time to embark on an involved construction of the New Jersey blue sky law in relation to plaintiff's CEA claims. 
Instead, we adopt the approach of federal courts elsewhere which have considered the question and determine that the most 
appropriate New Jersey limitations period is that provided by the state's blue sky law. "
759,8," There is support for the proposition that under the ""place of injury"" rule a cause of action can be said to have accrued in more 
than one state. See Sack v. Low, 478 F.2d at 368. "
760,9," The Electronic Relays opinion indicated that an earlier unpublished decision in the district had also chosen the two-year period 
to govern civil RICO actions. Id. at 653 (citing Traylor v. Central States, South East and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Nos. 
83-2206, 83-6283, slip op. at 5-6 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 6, 1984)). "
761,10," The parties agree that since the CEA does not provide for nationwide service of process in a private civil action, compare CEA 
§ 6c, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (governing injunctive actions by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission), whether personal 
jurisdiction exists over MACE as to the CEA claims asserted against it must be determined by reference to state laws governing 
the assertion of personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliaries. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e). "
762,11," Affidavit of Mary Ann Andersen, Vice President and Secretary of MACE (May 18, 1984). "
763,12," To plaintiff's suggestion that trading is done interchangeably on any of the three domestic commodity exchanges, MACE 
responds: In 1979 and 1980 MACE had a 1,000 ounce silver futures contract whereas the COMEX silver futures contract was for 
5,000 ounces. At that time because of brokerage and clearing fees it would not have been economically prudent to fill an 
order for 5,000 ounces silver futures with five MACE mini-silver contracts. At that time an order for a MACE size contract 
could not have been filled on another exchange. Furthermore, at that time a MACE silver futures contract was not 
deliverable on the COMEX, and a COMEX silver futures contract was not deliverable on MACE. Supplemental Affidavit of Mary Ann Andersen at para. 2 (Oct. 31, 1984). In light of our general conclusions below regarding the 
validity of plaintiff's ""unitary market"" theory, we do not discuss the specific factual issue of the fungibility of MACE and other 
futures contracts. "
764,13," We note in passing whimsey that the sale of onions for future delivery on United States contract markets is strictly prohibited. 
See 7 U.S.C. § 13-1 (1982)."
764,14," Plaintiff's citation of Bulova Watch Co. v. K. Hattori & Co., 508 F. Supp. 1322 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), in which Chief Judge Weinstein 
asserted long-arm jurisdiction over a Japanese corporation based on a finding that it transacted business in New York through 
its agent, a subsidiary, id. at 1345-47, is simply too different in fact as well as legal theory to provide guidance in the instant 
case."
764,15," HN14[
] Where antitrust violations are alleged, defendants' acts are properly characterized as tortious for the purpose of 
assessing personal jurisdiction. Rios v. Marshall, 530 F. Supp. 351, 367 n.16 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). "
766,16," The Supreme Court recently described the general problem of distinguishing concerted from unilateral action in ruling on a 
challenge to the evidence after trial in a case involving a claimed vertical price-fixing conspiracy: The economic effect of . . . the conduct described above -- unilateral and concerted vertical price setting . . . -- is in many, 
but not all, cases similar or identical. And judged from a distance, the conduct of the parties in the various situations can be 
indistinguishable. For example, the fact that a manufacturer and its distributors are in constant communication about prices "
767,," and marketing strategy does not alone show that the distributors are not making independent pricing decisions. A 
manufacturer and its distributors have legitimate reasons to exchange information about the prices and the reception of 
their products in the market."
767,*," * * The correct standard is that there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the 
manufacturer and distributor. That is, there must be direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the 
manufacturer and others had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 762, 768, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984) (citations omitted). 
Although the Court was writing in a different legal context about the proper standard of proof, not a pleading standard, its 
analysis is nevertheless instructive. See also Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 
1348, 1353, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (considering ""whether it was as plausible to conclude that [defendant's] price-cutting 
behavior was independent and not conspiratorial""). "
768,17," The Clayton Act's general venue section, Section 4, 15 U.S.C. § 15, which is applicable to individual as well as corporate 
defendants, may in theory be read in conjunction with Section 12 and the general venue statute in determining whether venue is 
proper as to a given defendant; however, the courts have read Section 12 as broader in scope than Section 4, so this is not 
necessary. See Pocahontas Supreme Coal Co. v. National Mines Corp., 90 F.R.D. 67, 69 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); Wood v. Santa 
Barbara Chamber of Commerce, 507 F. Supp. 1128, 1141 (D.Nev. 1980). "
772,18," Although in their memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss the exchange defendants challenged the antitrust claims 
based on the amended complaint's failure adequately to allege participation in and intent to further only the long conspiracy, in 
their presentation at oral argument the exchange defendants directly challenged the sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations with 
respect to the short conspiracy as well. See Transcript of Oral Argument at 23-25 (Dec. 20, 1985). "
796,1," Per se unlawful conduct is generally associated with pricing practices, such as price fixing. For example, price fixing by 
competitors is one of the practices which the courts have deemed to be unlawful with or without any explanation or justification 
for the practice.  Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1957). However, 
the courts are reluctant to find ""non-price"" restrictions per se unlawful because of the redeeming effects of certain non-price 
conduct.  GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 51, n. 18, 97 S. Ct. at 2558, n. 18. "
797,2," The Court also takes judicial notice of the dominance of the Oklahoma Sooners over all other collegiate football teams on the 
field as well as on the television telecast. "
798,3," Both Section One and Section Two of the Sherman Act require the Plaintiff to establish an adverse impact upon competition in 
the relevant product and geographic markets. "
805,1," Although defendants cite more recent authority from two other circuits which arguably conflicts with Anchor Serum, see 
Alexander v. National Farmers Organization, 687 F.2d 1173, 1208-09 (8th Cir. 1982), cert.  denied, 461 U.S. 937, 77 L. Ed. 2d 
313, 103 S. Ct. 2108; Nassau County Association of Insurance Agents, Inc. v. Aetna Life & Casualty Co., 497 F.2d 1151, 1153 
(2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 968, 95 S. Ct. 232, 42 L. Ed. 2d 184, they have not cited, and the court has not found, any 
authority from this circuit undermining its principles."
805,2," Owens-Corning maintains that because Reserve has suffered no injury under the antitrust laws, it has also failed to show 
""damage"" in Count III, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121-1/2 § 270(a). Owens-Corning's argument on Count III falls within its 
arguments on the antitrust claims in Counts I and II."
805,3," HN4[
] Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act provides: "
806,," That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or 
resale within the United States . . ., and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition 
or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who 
either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. . . ."
806,15, U.S.C. § 13(a).
806,4," Reserve identifies only BMA, LMC, and HWI as receiving discounts from CertainTeed, and fails to point to any evidence 
supporting its claim of price discrimination in favor of HWI. CertainTeed comes to Reserve's aid in its own motion for summary 
judgment, however. Not only does CertainTeed supply evidence of price discrimination against Reserve in favor of HWI, but it 
also produces evidence establishing price discrimination in favor of CBS and Ace. See CertainTeed's Statement of Undisputed 
Material Facts at 140; CertainTeed's Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact at A.7-A.9; deposition of Robert S. Mobley at 
102-06; affidavit of Robert S. Mobley at para. 15. Because this evidence would be admissible at trial, the court considers it as if it 
had been produced in support of Reserve's motion for summary judgment. "
807,5," Even if the court were to consider the depositions of Sharken and Hamrick and Reserve's Exhibit G, and to determine that they 
are sufficient to complete Reserve's prima facie showing of a Robinson-Patman violation, the court would still have to deny 
Reserve's motion for partial summary judgment because of CertainTeed's valid ""good faith meeting competition"" defense, 
discussed in part IIB of this opinion, infra. "
808,6," CertainTeed also seeks summary judgment on the ground that Reserve has suffered no antitrust injury and therefore lacks 
standing to maintain this action. The court addressed that argument in part I of this opinion. "
809,7," Prices in the industry are ordinarily measured in terms of percentages off a standard dealer list price, which is uniform among 
different manufacturers. Because the specific numerical percentages are not material to this discussion and CertainTeed has 
requested that they not be disclosed, the expressions ""X"" and ""Y"" are employed in lieu of the actual percentages throughout this 
opinion. "
820,1," In an earlier order, Judge Decker denied plaintiffs' motion to certify the class. Plaintiffs have subsequently filed a motion with 
this court for reconsideration of that order or alternatively to permit the joinder of individual cab drivers as additional plaintiffs. In 
light of the order the court enters today it is unnecessary to address these pending motions."
820,2," The particular ordinance has been amended, often with minor changes, eighteen times since its passage in 1963. See 
Appendix Yellow and Checker's Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment. "
821,3," In Metro Cable Co. v. CATV of Rockford, Inc., 516 F.2d 220 (7th Cir. 1975), the Seventh Circuit considered section 11-42-11 of 
the Municipal Code, worded almost identically to the provision in question here. Compare § 11-42-11 (granting corporate 
authorities to the power to license, franchise and tax the ""business of operating a community antenna television system"") with § 
11-42-6 (same authority over cabmen and other, similar occupations). The court found the legislative provision granted the 
authority to the City of Rockford to create a monopoly of cable television in Rockford in favor of a single private company. The 
court had no occasion to discuss the City of Lafayette foreseeability test, because Metro Cable was decided three years before 
City of Lafayette. "
822,4," The parties dispute whether there was an actual ""agreement"" or ""contract"" between representatives of Yellow and Checker and 
the City. See 12(e) Statement of Undisputed Facts paras. 21-26; City of Chicago's 12(f) Statement of Genuine Issues para. 21-
29. The City contends that Yellow and Checker agreed to drop their damage claims if the City enacted an ordinance, drafted by 
Yellow and Checker and admittedly giving Yellow and Checker 80% of all the licenses. Plaintiffs claim that the three parties 
reached an agreement, a contract which gave enforceable rights to Yellow and Checker and which Yellow and Checker are 
suing to enforce. For the reasons discussed later with reference to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, this dispute over the 
conclusions to be drawn from essentially admitted facts does not raise a genuine issue precluding the grant of summary 
judgment. It is undisputed that as part of settlement negotiations, Yellow and Checker submitted a proposed ordinance, which 
was debated by the City Council, and enacted shortly thereafter. The claims for damages were subsequently dismissed. "
823,5," The powers to tax, license, and regulate necessarily imply limitations on a free market economy. See Easterbrook, Antitrust 
and the Economics of Federalism 26 J. Law & Econ. 23, 23, 27-29 (1983) (""Regulation displaces competition. . . . Sometimes 
legislation may be justified as necessary to correct 'imperfections' in the market, but in most cases legislation is designed to 
defeat the market altogether."") Limitations on the number of taxicabs that may operate at any one time, prescribing the rate of 
compensation, setting qualifications for drivers, fixing the level of profits, fares, and passenger occupancy have the clear effect 
of eliminating certain, weaker competitors and favoring others while altering the demand for taxi service and curtailing the 
available supply of taxis. While there is little contemporary legislative history of the passage of the authorizing statute, one commentator has identified 
several of the original city purposes in enacting the earliest restrictions on carriers.  The regulations had the objectives of 1) 
raising revenue through license fees; 2) limiting contracting terms to prevent extortionate rates; 3) organizing the flow of cabs in 
traffic; 4) imposing minimum standards on conditions and appearances of vehicles; 5) ensuring responsible and law abiding 
drivers; and 6) ensuring financial responsibility of drivers and companies. See Kitch, Isaacson & Kasper, The Regulation of 
Taxicabs in Chicago, 14 J. Law & Econ. 285, 302-16 (1971). These police power concerns, each of which would implicate 
restrictions on the free market, were apparent to the state legislature when it enacted § 11-42-6, expressly permitting the City the 
authority to regulate the taxi industry to carry out these local concerns."
823,6," Two other purposes, to ensure adequate profits for taxi owners and adequate earnings for drivers, were advanced to justify the 
most restrictive entry controls during the 1920's. Kitch, Isaacson & Kasper, supra note 5, at 302, 316-17. In 1937, the taxi drivers 
struck. As part of that settlement, the drivers were given greater commissions and a five cent increase in the flag pull charge.  Id. 
at 326. HN11[
] The City's power, given by statute to ""prescribe the compensation"" drivers were to receive, supported the 
creation of entry controls. The limitations on the number of licenses operating at any one time, and the fixing of fares resulted in 
anticompetitive effects and are a foreseeable consequence of the power to set the compensation of drivers. "
824,7," HN14[
] While it is the best indication of expected anticompetitive results, compulsion by the legislature is not necessary to 
satisfy the state action defense.  Town of Hallie, 105 S. Ct. at 1710."
824,8," See LaSalle Nat'l Bank, 777 F.2d at 382 (economic competition is ""one of the chief obstacles to pollution control""); Wellwoods 
Development, 631 F. Supp. at 226 (safety is ""both literally and figuratively placed first"" in Illinois aeronautics; safety would be 
""adversely affected by the unrestrained play of market forces."") In neither case was competition considered the preeminent or 
exclusive goal of the state authorization to regulate."
824,9," It is clear that the regulation of taxi service is a matter of local concern implicating the protection and safety of the public, 
Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 726 F.2d 1430, 1434 (9th Cir. 1984), cert.  denied, 471 U.S. 1003, 105 S. Ct. 
1865, 85 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1985); Yellow Cab Co., 396 Ill. at 397, 71 N.E. at 657, and in such areas, the tension caused by the 
national interference with local regulation is greatest.  Town of Hallie, 105 S. Ct. at 1719 n. 7; see generally Easterbrook, supra, 
note 5, at 22-25. "
825,10," Plaintiffs argue these provisions may not be used to bar this action because they were enacted after the filing of the complaint. 
The ordinance was enacted in 1963, but the effects of that conduct, allegedly constituting violations of the antitrust laws, 
continue to the present (as does the ordinance). The court need not decide the question of retroactivity today, however, because 
the Illinois act is not used to bar any part of this claim. The court only cites these provisions, in the absence of any contemporary 
legislative history, as revealing what the legislature foresees in empowering municipalities to regulate in certain areas. Present-
day enactments, worded almost identically to those enacted in 1881, are thought to have logically foreseeable anticompetitive 
effects as is § 11-42-6. While such anticipated results alone are insufficient to authorize the conduct in question, the court thinks 
it useful and relevant in understanding the legislative meaning of the authorizing provision. "
826,11," See generally Kitch, Isaacson & Kasper, supra note 5, at 286-89, 316-35 (reciting the long history of intensive regulations of 
the taxi industry in Chicago from the turn of the century to the enactment of the 1963 ordinance). These authors criticize the 
courts for playing an ""important and continuing role in legitimizing the regulation."" Id. at 344.  Nonetheless, they recognize the 
Illinois courts have consistently upheld anticompetitive schemes concluding that the City was authorized by the state statute to 
engage in such regulation. Again, while the Illinois courts' opinions do not decide the question facing this court, they are 
""instructive on the question of the state legislature's intent in enacting the statutes relating to the municipal [regulation of the taxi 
industry]."" Town of Hallie, 105 S.Ct at 1719 n. 8. "
827,12," Plaintiffs contend that the hearings on the ordinance before the Committee on Local Transportation and the subsequent 
enactment of the ordinance by the City Council are insignificant for purposes of this case because the agreement had already 
been made. Yet plaintiffs fail to note the hearings contained significant discussion of the ordinance, even though it was ultimately 
adopted largely unchanged. The City Council's enactment of the ordinance is not insignificant either. Despite agreements 
reached by any aldermen, the mayor, the corporation counsel or anyone else, they do not become the law of the City until and 
unless the City Council passes an ordinance though its regular legislative process. It is this undeniable fact, identified by Areeda 
& Turner as an impossibility of proof of causation of an antitrust injury, that encourages them to argue convincingly that all 
successful petitioning should be immune. P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, at para. 204e. "
828,13," Principally supporting plaintiffs' argument is its conclusion that the 1963 ordinance provisions grant a perpetual right to 80% of 
the licenses to Yellow and Checker. The court does not so read the provisions.  HN21[
] Section 28-33 of the ordinance 
prohibited amendment of the ordinance for five years. This provision was added to ensure stability to the new regulatory 
scheme. In 1968, this provision was extended for another five years. In 1973, the provision was not renewed. Thus the City 
remains free to amend the provisions of the ordinance. Plaintiffs also identify sections 28.22.1 and 28-31.1 regarding the 
issuance of new licenses to only be granted on a pro rata basis in accordance to the 80% monopoly currently held by Yellow and 
Checker. Plaintiffs argue that upon expiration of the broad prohibition against amendment of any aspect of the ordinance, the 
specific limitation on the issuance of new licenses contained in § 28-31.1 took over. It seems clear, however, that HN22[
] if the 
City has the power to do away with the general ordinance, it has the power to do away with any particular provision. See 
Chirikos v. Yellow Cab Co., 87 Ill. App. 3d 569, 410 N.E.2d 61, 65, 43 Ill. Dec. 61 (1980) (council has right ""to repeal the then 
existing ordinance or amend it as it saw fit."") In any event, the City cannot mephistophelian-like sell its police powers to a private 
company or anyone else. It maintains legislative authority to enact, amend, or repeal any statute consistent with the constitution. 
See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Jenkins, 297 U.S. 629, 80 L. Ed. 943, 56 S. Ct. 611 (1936); City of Chicago v. O'Connell, 278 Ill. 
591, 116 N.E. 210 (1917)."
828,14," There is little question that Yellow and Checker, as holders of an overwhelming majority of the available licenses prior to the 
enactment of the 1963 ordinance, had considerable power to influence the enactment of an ordinance in its favor. Outside of its 
own market share, its greatest strength (and impediment to competition depending on the view) was its control of the flow of 
information regarding the operation of taxis. Most of the data demonstrating the need for limits on the number of cabs to favor 
stability, the need for financial integrity, or the need for fare increases or other operational limits was provided by the cab 
companies.  The City, to a large extent, was forced to rely on Yellow & Checker's own assessment and calculation of the needs 
of the taxicab market in making its policy decisions. See generally Kitch, Isaacson & Kasper, supra note 5, at 342-47. Thus, the 
City naturally (if not wisely) accepted much of the economic justification that underlay the proposed ordinance. "
845,1," On July 24, 1986, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order which indicates that on June 18, 1986, Clayton again 
accepted the Committee's recommendation to deny accreditation to St.  George's. This ruling makes it unnecessary for the court 
to consider that motion. "
870,1," By stipulation, plaintiff conceded that its ""remaining and State law based claims"" brought about no ""economic damages"" 
beyond the ""inception of litigation by the defendant[s],"" which is the subject matter of the appeal. "
871,2," The conduct in Noerr concerned an alleged conspiracy to monopolize and restrain trade in the long-distance freight business in 
violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The truckers alleged that the railroads sought to achieve their illegal goals by 
conducting a publicity campaign against truckers designed to destroy them.  365 U.S. at 129. "
872,3," The Court noted that although unethical conduct was insufficient to satisfy the sham exception in Noerr when the conspiracy 
concerned lobbying activities, it can be sufficient when the conspiracy concerns use of adjudicatory processes.  404 U.S. at 512. 
The Court gave as an example of unethical conduct such activities as perjury, fraud, conspiracy, bribery, misrepresentations, a 
pattern of baseless, repetitive claims, or other kinds of abuse of process. Id. at 512-13."
872,4," Plaintiff urges this court to resolve the question whether the sham exception requires more than one baseless suit. See 
Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., 734 F.2d 1157, 1162-63 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 884, 105 S. Ct. 253, 
83 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1984). But in view of our agreement with the district court's determination that defendant's state suit was not 
baseless, the issue is not before the court."
872,5, One example of grave abuse is litigation that is an integral part of a larger antitrust conspiracy. 739 F.2d at 1415.
872,6," The court emphasized that the judgment resulting from defendant's suit, not the mere filing of the suit, was the cause of 
plaintiff's harm.  739 F.2d at 1414. "
873,7," Some language in Razorback arguably suggests that a party's motive in bringing a suit is never relevant. See 761 F.2d at 488 
(""Defendants' motive may have been selfish or altruistic or mixed; that is immaterial. Regardless of motive, defendants' actions 
are clearly within the ambit of First Amendment protection . . . .""). But see California Motor Transport, 404 U.S. at 511-12. "
874,8," Razorback's facts are in many ways analogous to those in this case. A group of competitors in Razorback opposed the bond 
issue for a competitor. When the county judge approved the bond issue, they challenged this action in court, alleging that the 
bond issue violated the Arkansas constitution. They lost in the trial court and appealed."
874,9," It defies common sense to suggest defendants did not seek a favorable judgment. A favorable judgment declaring the state law 
unconstitutional would have prevented the sale of the bonds, which was defendants' allegedly anticompetitive purpose. The 
record on appeal does not suggest that this is a case in which "". . . the stakes, discounted by the probability of winning, would be 
too low to repay the investment in litigation."" Grip-Pak, 694 F.2d at 472 (Judge Posner discussing examples of when the stakes 
would suggest defendant's purpose was not to obtain a favorable judgment). Other circumstances indicate that the state court action was not a sham or in any way an abuse of the judicial process. 
Defendants promptly stipulated that plaintiff might intervene. There was also a further agreement providing that the Michigan 
court give expedited consideration to the defendants' suit challenging the constitutionality of the Michigan law authorizing the 
EDC. These arrangements indicate that the defendants' state suit was not an effort to defeat plaintiff's EDC petition by delay, 
harassment, or any kind of ""reprehensible practice."" "
875,10," We do not consider the conversation between plaintiff's president and Bowles, a former member of the Mid-Michigan Farm 
and Grain Association, that upon certain conditions the latter ""believed"" or ""felt"" that he might get the group to drop its appeal 
and effect a settlement to be a material circumstance precluding a grant of summary judgment. In granting summary judgment 
the district court gave plaintiff's contentions the benefit of the doubt. It assumed an ""attempt to influence official decision making"" 
and ""anti-competitive purpose"" on the part of defendants, but it held this behavior to be protected and exempted from antitrust 
claims because defendants' actions, particularly in bringing about the constitutional challenge in court, were not an ""abuse of 
governmental processes,"" nor ""unlawful lobbying activities,"" nor ""sham"" litigation. The district court held that to come within the 
sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which protects the important first amendment right of petition, the legal action 
must be shown to be ""baseless, initiated without probable cause, or tainted by fraud, perjury, bribery, or other practices 
constituting a corruption of the judicial process."""
875,11," We acknowledge, however, plaintiff's contention that evidence which ""supports"" its sham theory was not before the state 
judge, but the contention was considered by the district court, which concluded: ""plaintiffs in the present case present no facts to 
support an inference that the defendants abused the judicial process . . . ."""
875,12," The dissent implies that by creating the presumption in the present case we are immunizing from government regulation the 
challenged conduct, which concededly may have an anticompetitive effect. But we have not ""immunized"" defendants' conduct in 
the present case because we have afforded the plaintiff an opportunity to demonstrate that defendants' state court suit was 
something other than a serious challenge to the validity of the state law relied upon by plaintiff to obtain a special tax benefit. 
The dissent asserts that we should determine whether the defendants' action and motivation in bringing the state court challenge 
amounted to an ""abuse of process."" See Grip-Pak, 694 F.2d at 471-72. We do not disagree that if plaintiff could establish that 
defendants' actions constitute the tort of abuse of process, in the sense that defendants' suit corrupted or improperly interfered 
with the judicial process, that the sham exception does not apply. See Razorback, 761 F.2d at 487; Assoc. Container Transp., 
705 F.2d at 59 (states that ""abuses of the governmental process"" such as ""misrepresentation"" or ""a pattern of baseless repetitive 
claims may induce antitrust liability""). We merely are creating an evidentiary presumption to facilitate the applicability of the sham 
exception. We would also agree with the dissent's acknowledgement that defendants probably would admit that they filed their 
state court action with an intent to impede or damage plaintiff's effort to construct a competing grain elevator aided by special 
statutory benefits, and that such intent is insufficient as a matter of law to take this action out of the protection of the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. See dissent at n.4. "
876,1," This analysis was criticized by Handler & De Sevo, The Noerr Doctrine and its Sham Exception, 6 Cardozo L. Rev. 1, 33-40 
(1984), but the result it reached was accepted by Kintner & Bauer, Antitrust Exemptions for Private Requests for Governmental 
Action: A Critical Analysis of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 17 U.C.D. L. Rev. 549, 575-76 (1984). "
877,2," Although this section of the Restatement does not expressly require an improper affirmative act in furtherance of the illegitimate 
purpose (as does Dean Prosser), the comments and illustrations make clear that such an act is required: A is a dangerously insane person. B, her son, instigates lunacy proceedings against her, seeking to have her confined for 
the protection of herself and others. His motive in doing so is to succeed to the control of her property after she is 
committed. This is not abuse of process. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682 illustration 4."
877,3, See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682 comment b. 
878,4," Plaintiff's briefs assert that defendants filed their action with the intent to damage plaintiff's efforts to construct a grain elevator 
that would compete with defendants' elevators. Indeed, defendants would probably admit that this was their intent. However, as 
discussed by Judge Wellford above, this intent does not (contrary to plaintiff's position) make a sham out of defendant's lawsuit. 
Nevertheless, even though plaintiff was laboring under a mistaken view of the sham exception, plaintiff managed to bring 
forward enough facts to rebut the panel's presumption. "

statements has been conceded. See Long Defendants' Statement Pursuant to Rule 3(g), para. 79."" Apex mem. at 157 n.6. That 
3(g) statement, however, simply summarizes Apex's contentions concerning the statements. It does not concede the existence 
of the statements. "

943,7," The opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 
(1918), is sometimes referred to as the classic statement of the rule of reason: HN4[
] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the 
court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts.  Id. at 238."
943,8," The distinction between a vertical nonprice restraint and a vertical price restriction is an important one. HN6[
] The Supreme 
Court has made it clear that price restrictions are per se illegal while nonprice restraints are evaluated under the rule of reason. 
Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 51 n.18. We are concerned here only with vertical nonprice restraints."
943,9," Horizontal restraints, on the other hand, are agreements among competitors that restrain competition among persons or firms 
at the same level of distribution. Horizontal restraints are ordinarily illegal per se. See, e.g., United States v. Topco Associates, 
Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972); United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 357-58, 87 S. Ct. 
1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967)."
943,10," The White Motor Court stated that: We do not know enough of the economic and business stuff out of which these arrangements emerge to be certain. * * * 
We need to know more than we do about the actual impact of these arrangements on competition to decide whether they 
have such a ""pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue"" ( Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 
supra, p.5 [of 356 U.S.]) and therefore should be classified as per se violations of the Sherman Act."

at 52 n.19."
944,12," Some commentators have since gone so far as to suggest that purely vertical restrictions on intrabrand competition, both price 
and nonprice, should be legal per se. Posner, The Next Step in the Antitrust Treatment of Restricted Distribution: Per Se 
Legality, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 6, 25 (1981); see also Bork, Vertical Restraints: Schwinn Overruled, 1977 Sup. Ct. Rev. 171, 190-92. 
At least one of these commentators has referred to the market power approach, which we adopt today, as only a ""sound interim 
measure"" preceding the adoption of per se legality. Posner, supra, at 25."
944,13," The Sylvania Court did not apply the rule of reason to the facts of that case, and its explanation of the rule was limited to 
repeating the statement of the rule in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 
(1918), which we have quoted supra at note 7.  433 U.S. at 49 n.15. We are not the first to note the lack of guidance provided by 
the rule of reason. See, e.g., Graphic Products Distributors, Inc. v. Itek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1983); Posner, 
supra note 12, at 7, 14-15; Pitofsky, The Sylvania Case: Antitrust Analysis of Non-Price Vertical Restrictions, 78 Colum. L. Rev. 
1, 11 (1978). "
945,14," Nothing in this court's decision in National Reporting Co. v. Alderson Reporting Co., 763 F.2d 1020 (8th Cir. 1985), is contrary 
to our decision here. The National Reporting court stated in dicta, discussing a statement from Hiland Dairy, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 
402 F.2d 968 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 961, 89 S. Ct. 2096, 23 L. Ed. 2d 748 (1969), that itself is ""probably dictum,"" 
763 F.2d at 1024, that ""of course a violation of section 1 may occur whether or not market dominance or monopoly power is 
actually attained."" 763 F.2d at 1024-25. Both National Reporting and Hiland Dairy were monopolization cases and the language 
from them that is brought to our attention here was directed in both cases at per se violations. Furthermore, no case cited to us by the plaintiffs squarely considers and rejects the market power approach. Although Eiberger 
v. Sony Corp., 622 F.2d 1068 (2d Cir. 1980), could be characterized as having negative implications for the market power 
approach, see id. at 1080-81, another Second Circuit case, Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir. 1978) (en 
banc), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1979), reads more positively toward the approach. Neither 
case, however, addresses the approach directly.  Harold Friedman Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., 587 F.2d 127 (3d Cir. 1978), a 
case concerning a restrictive covenant in a shopping center lease, stated that ""no single aspect is dispositive,"" id. at 143, but the 
court explicitly distinguished the claim before it from claims concerning territorial restrictions on resale imposed on distributors by 
manufacturers. Id. And again, the market power approach was not directly considered by the court in Harold Friedman."
945,15," In reaching this conclusion we are mindful of the continuing concern over the role of economic analysis in the antitrust field. 
This court itself has not been immune from the debate. See Paschall v. Kansas City Star Co., 727 F.2d 692, 706 (8th Cir.) (en 
banc) (Heaney, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 872, 105 S. Ct. 222, 83 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1984). However, as the Supreme 
Court stated in Sylvania, ""an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective benchmarks."" 433 
U.S. at 53 n.21. Moreover, economic reasoning is widely employed in antitrust, particularly in the formation of per se rules. See 
Bork, supra note 12, at 178. "
946,16," In this section and the next we refer to Assam and Downtown collectively as ""Assam."" "
947,17," According to the Bodie affidavit, Miller's market share was 19.6% in eastern South Dakota, 17.7% in eastern South Dakota 
and adjoining areas in Minnesota and Iowa, and 19.1% in the entire state of South Dakota. The market share figures in the 
Bodie affidavit were derived from shipment figures reported by brewers to state agencies and from records of sales by Miller 
distributors. The figures are for the period from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985."
947,18," The district court concluded that Miller's 19.1% market share did not constitute market power under the circumstances of this 
case. Assam has not provided any basis for an argument, given a market share of 19.1%, that Miller does have market power. 
The district court conclusion is consistent with numerous similar determinations in other cases. See, e.g., Graphic Products 
Distributors, Inc. v. Itek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1568-71 (11th Cir. 1983) (70-75% market share constitutes market power); 
Donald B. Rice Tire Co. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 483 F. Supp. 750 (D. Md. 1980) (20-25% market share does not constitute 
market power), aff'd, 638 F.2d 15 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 864, 102 S. Ct. 324, 70 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1981); O.S.C. Corp. v. 
Apple Computer, Inc., 601 F. Supp. 1274 (C.D. Cal. 1985) (up to 20% market share does not constitute market power where 
substantial competition exists), aff'd, 792 F.2d 1464 (9th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, Miller's market share had been declining since 
well before the date of the distributor agreement at issue here and two competing brewers had larger market shares than Miller."
947,19," Plaintiffs rely on these statements by Fred Assam: Q: How do you decide what beers to put on promotion at Assam Drug? A: Well, depending on, number one, what we can -- let's say over the last four or five years, five, six years Millers has been 
our favorite because it's the biggest selling brand in the country. Windsor has been our favorite promotional item for liquor 
because it's the biggest. It's sixty thousand cases versus ten thousand for the second best. So we'd rather kick Miller than 
anything else. Obviously it's the best brand to promote. I forgot what you asked me. Q: Is it the case now in -- A: Same thing now. Let's say Schmidt comes along and they have a dollar, two dollars a case off and you can buy a case 
for four and a half. We might sell that case for $4.99. That's a hell of a price for a case of good beer. We'll put something in 
like that. If we go back to what our druthers are, just even-Steven, we'll take Millers first because it's the biggest brands. Q: You say Miller is the biggest brand in the country today? A: Yes. Right now they've lost some ground in the last year or so. Budweiser has kind of caught up. I guess it's 50-50 
today, I would say. Q: Competition between those two brands is pretty fierce, though? A: It always has been. Deposition of Fred Assam at 134-35."
947,20," Assam also argues that product differentiation in the beer industry creates an issue of fact here. Although it is true that market 
power may stem from product differentiation, Graphic Products Distributors, 717 F.2d at 1570, Assam's only support for its "
948,," argument is in some excerpts from 1982 congressional hearing testimony on the Malt Beverage Interbrand Competition Act. The 
general testimony cited by Assam does not address the South Dakota beer market or the market power approach. Miller has 
presented expert affidavits asserting that product differentiation is not a significant force in the brewing industry and that brewing 
is a highly competitive industry. We do not believe that Assam has raised a genuine issue of fact as to product differentiation."
948,21," Assam's claim that it now has to pay a higher price for Miller beer is irrelevant to our considerations here. It may well be that 
because of advantageous pricing policies at Brewster Assam got a good deal on Miller beer there, but loss of that good deal 
does not establish an antitrust violation without proof of Miller's market power and a showing that the anticompetitive effects of 
the distributor agreement outweigh its procompetitive effects. Because we agree with the district court that Miller had no market 
power, we find no need to go further and balance the competitive effects of the agreement. We note that Brewster is not before 
this court complaining that it has been restrained. Assam, of course, is not precluded from buying Miller beer from its local 
distributor and from seeking prices from that distributor similar to those it paid to Brewster, to the extent that such activity is 
consistent with state regulations. "

conclusion. In this connection, we note that the RFP terms are directed toward providing the widest array of programing at the 
lowest cost, and do not seek to prohibit the communication of any message. Thus, the RFP deals primarily with rates, quality 
and geographic breadth of service and states: The City is establishing few requirements as it desires that all applicants have maximum freedom to develop their own 
innovative proposals. * * * The City is interested in receiving proposals for a system with the capacity of delivering at least 
50 channels to subscribers and with * * * technical standards which exceed current FCC requirements. * * * The City is not 
interested in proposed capacity which will not be used or which will necessitate unreasonably high subscriber rates. The 
City is interested in a flexible system which can best accommodate the present and future needs of institutional users 
without unduly burdening the average subscriber."

977,, 
978,10," TCI proposed the following Noerr-Pennington instructions: NOERR-PENNINGTON -- GENERAL The Constitution ensures the right of all persons and corporations, whether acting individually or in concert, to petition 
government for political action, recognizing that persons in the exercise of these constitutional rights naturally will petition 
government for political action that is favorable to their particular interests and unfavorable to the interests of others. The 
Supreme Court has declared that this right to petition government for political action is paramount, and that the concerted effort 
of various parties genuinely to influence public officials does not in any way violate the law regardless of intent or purpose. Joint 
efforts truly intended to influence public officials to take official action do not violate antitrust laws even though the efforts are 
intended to eliminate competition. Similarly, the Constitution protects a person's right of access to the courts for resolution of disputed issues. The antitrust laws 
are not violated when a person files a suit, even if he hopes and intends that the judge or jury will enter verdicts which will injure 
his competitors. In short, activity which is intended to influence or cause official governmental action -- whether by an individual such as a mayor, 
by a legislative body such as a City Council, or by judges and juries -- does not violate the law, regardless of the intentions of the 
persons engaging in such activity. NOERR-PENNINGTON -- APPLICATION TO THIS CASE To the extent that you find that defendants engaged in legitimate efforts to influence governmental action or to seek redress for 
its grievances through the courts, you are directed that you cannot find the defendants liable for any of the claims asserted by 
plaintiff based upon such activity. For example, if you were to find that all of defendants' actions about which plaintiff complains 
fit into this category of legitimate attempts to influence official action or to vindicate rights through the courts, then you could not 
find defendants liable for any of the offenses charged. That is, if you should conclude from a review of the evidence that 
defendants did nothing more in this case than take actions for the purpose of persuading the City to award them a cable 
television franchise on some basis, then you may not find that defendants committed any of the offenses charged, even if you 
believe that the purpose or necessary effect of such actions was to exclude plaintiff from obtaining a franchise. On the other 
hand, if you were to find that none of defendants' actions fit into that category, then you would simply assess those actions under "
979,," the standards we have already discussed and without regard to this instruction. Finally, if you find that some of defendants' 
actions were legitimate attempts to influence governmental action but that some were not, then when you decide whether the 
evidence establishes that defendants committed any of the charged offenses, you must exclude from your consideration those 
actions which you find did in fact fall into that category, for they may not form the basis -- in whole or in part -- for any liability. NOERR-PENNINGTON -- EXCEPTIONS However, the activity we are discussing must consist of genuine efforts to influence governmental action or to vindicate rights 
through the courts. Protection does not extend to purported petitioning that is a mere sham to cover what actually is nothing 
more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business of a competitor. That is, protection does not extend to activities that 
are merely a pretext for inflicting on plaintiff an injury not caused by any government action. Thus, you must consider whether 
defendants' activities were not really an attempt to influence an official to take official action, but instead were an attempt to 
interfere directly with the business of plaintiff. When deciding this question, you must consider the intent of defendants in taking 
such actions. If you find that their intent was to obtain some governmental action, no matter what the action was, then these 
activities were genuine. The success of defendants' efforts is evidence of their genuineness. In the context of defendants' lawsuit against the City, about which you have heard some evidence, you must decide whether 
defendants filed the suit with the hope of obtaining a judicial ruling in their favor, or whether the suit was only intended to directly 
injure plaintiff in some manner. The extent to which a lawsuit involves legitimately disputed issues is circumstantial evidence of 
the genuineness of the suit. The knowledge that defense of the litigation might impose burdensome costs upon the City would 
not be sufficient to establish that defendants brought the suit in bad faith, in an attempt to injure plaintiff. Finally, the Constitution does not protect attempts to influence governmental action by methods which are illegal in and of 
themselves; for example, by bribery of government officials. Such actions are not legitimate attempts to petition the government. In sum, you must decide whether all or some of defendants' activities were legitimate and genuine efforts to obtain a franchise 
from the City. All such efforts must be excluded from your consideration of this case because they cannot -- as a matter of law -- 
form the basis of liability for any of the offenses charged."
979,11," The Noerr Court noted, however, that the defendants' activities -- even though they included misrepresentations and unethical 
conduct -- were not covered by the Sherman Act at least insofar as those activities comprised mere solicitation of governmental "
980,," action with respect to the passage and enforcement of laws.  365 U.S. at 140-42. The unethical conduct referred to involved the 
defendants' use of the so-called ""third-party technique"" -- a misrepresentation through which the railroad defendants' attempts to 
gain passage of laws favorable to railroads and unfavorable to the plaintiff trucking companies were made to appear as 
originating from independent parties. However, even though the use of this third-party technique involved misrepresentation as 
to the source of the petitioning, the position advanced by the defendants -- essentially that trucks were harmful to the state's 
highways and interfered with motorists' rights -- was a legitimate one, ""conducted along lines normally accepted in our political 
system,"" id. at 145, even though anti-competitive. The case before us is distinguishable in that the jury could properly have 
found, based on the facts and the court's instructions, that TCI's activities, more than being simply anti-competitive, were not 
genuine lobbying activities at all but instead were heavy-handed attempts to directly interfere with the business relationships of a 
competitor, to disturb the political process and to coerce the City into extending TCI's monopoly position, even though Central 
offered a superior cable system at lower cost. Much of TCI's ""lobbying"" made no attempt to provide the City with information on 
which to base a reasonable choice but, instead, sought to subvert the franchising process. "
981,12," The plaintiff in Mark Aero was an air taxi operator who wanted to reopen the Kansas City Municipal Airport for commercial 
flights. Two of the plaintiff's competitors opposed the reopening by conducting a publicity campaign and by exerting pressure on 
public officials. No illegal activities were alleged, as in the case before us, although Mark Aero did allege that the defendants 
""induced others to make false and misleading statements"" and used ""economic coercion"" on City officials. We hold that the 
defendants' activities were protected by Noerr-Pennington because ""none of the defendants' alleged wrongful acts constitute 
more than joint efforts to influence the City officials' decision in the airport controversy."" 580 F.2d at 296."
981,13," TCI alleges that the defendants in Westborough Mall attempted to bribe public officials. However, our reading of that case 
reveals that it did not invoke the sham exception on grounds of bribery but on the ground that the plaintiffs might be able to 
prove an illegal conspiracy between defendants and the City which included illegal private negotiations such as those at issue in 
the case before us. "
982,14," TCI also alleges that the trial court's conspiracy instruction ""essentially negated"" the Noerr-Pennington defense. We reject this 
argument. First of all, TCI did not specifically raise this objection below, and thus we could order a new trial on this basis only if 
the alleged error is ""plain error."" In any event, we find TCI's oblique argument to be completely without merit. We find nothing in 
the conspiracy instruction which negates the Noerr-Pennington instruction. The jury was informed that ""each * * * instruction is 
equally binding upon you."" Conspiracy Instruction Number 11, read along with Instructions Number 21 and Number 14 (Noerr-
Pennington) fully informed the jury that before any antitrust liability could be imposed, it had to find that TCI ""knowingly entered 
into a combination or conspiracy"" and that in determining liability, it could not consider TCI's ""legitimate lobbying efforts."""
982,15," Central raises several other reasons why TCI's conduct was not protected under Noerr-Pennington. Although some of these 
arguments may have merit, we need not reach them here. Central argues that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable 
here because this case involves a municipality acting in an essentially commercial rather than in an executive, legislative or "
983,," adjudicatory capacity. See, e.g., Sacramento, 440 F.2d at 1099; Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 144 U.S. App. D.C. 56, 444 F.2d 
931, 941-42 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972); George R. Whitten, Jr. v.

also argues that TCI's conduct cannot be described as merely ""political"" in nature because the ultimate act it sought from the 
City, the award of a cable television franchise, is not protected ""state action"" because there is no clearly and affirmatively 
expressed policy in Missouri authorizing cities to displace competition in the cable television industry. See, e.g., Community 
Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982). Finally, Central argues that the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable because the jury found that there was an illegal conspiracy between TCI and certain 
City officials, including Utterback and the mayor. See, e.g., Affiliated Capital Corp. v. City of Houston, 735 F.2d 1555, 1566-67

question of whether the plaintiff, as a condition of maintaining a treble-damage action, must prove that he made a demand for 
the excluded product or service, the Court stated: ""The issue is whether, once the embargo was lifted, Zenith wanted to enter, 
had the capacity to do so, and was prevented from entering by its inability to secure a patent license and by other operations of 
the English patent pool. Section 4 of the Clayton Act required that Zenith show an injury to its 'business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.' If Zenith's failure to enter the English market was attributable to its lack of desire, its 
limited production capabilities, or to other factors independent of HRI's unlawful conduct, Zenith would not have met its burden 
under §§ 4."" (Footnote omitted.) "
988,19," TCI contends, in an argument not raised before the jury, that Central's damage estimate failed to adequately account for 
Central's start-up costs. However, our review of the damages study reveals that start-up costs of $1.6 million were accounted 
for. If TCI believed this figure understated start-up costs, it should have introduced evidence on this. Given that TCI failed to 
raise this argument before the jury, and that there is no evidence to suggest that Central's estimate is unreasonable, we assume 
that $1.6 million in estimated start-up costs is reasonable. TCI also suggests in passing that Central's damages theory erroneously uses its third year of operations as the base for 
determining fair market value. However, TCI failed to object to this method at trial. Moreover, the third year coincided with the 
date of trial, and thus had a reasonable basis. "
997,1," A motion to set aside this judgment was subsequently denied by both the district court and the court of appeals. D.L. Auld Co. 
v. Chroma Graphics Corp., 753 F.2d 1029 (Fed.Cir.) cert. denied, 474 U.S. 825, 106 S. Ct. 83, 88 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1985). "
999,2," Invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Park Electrochemical argues that Auld should not be allowed, in supporting this 
motion, to deny the financial interdependence of Park Electrochemical and Park Nameplate.  The Court finds that doctrine 
inapplicable for several reasons. First, ""it is less than clear whether the doctrine has vitality in the Second Circuit."" United States 
v. Starrett City Associates, 605 F. Supp. 262, 263 (E.D.N.Y.1985). Second, an essential prerequisite of the doctrine, that the 
party to be estopped must have been successful in espousing a prior inconsistent position, is not present. Auld failed to convince 
the Court that the corporate veil between Park Nameplate and Park Electrochemical should be pierced. Auld's second theory, on 
which it was successful in avoiding summary judgment, is not relevant to this motion. Finally, to apply the doctrine in this 
circumstance would clash with the doctrine of law of the case. It has previously been determined in this litigation that Park 
Nameplate's corporate identity should not be disregarded. Park Electrochemical has offered no justification for now reaching a 
contrary conclusion. "
1000,3," In discussing its first counterclaim, Park Electrochemical suggests that it may move for attorneys' fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C.A. 
§ 285. Brief for Park Electrochemical at 4 n. 1. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of such a motion, the Court finds 
that Park Electrochemical's right to bring that motion is not linked to the maintenance of this counterclaim and thus should not 
prevent its dismissal. "
1001,4," A statement in Park Electrochemical's brief which tracks the language of Zenith, see id. at 4 n. 1 (""Auld's patent obstructed the 
efforts of Park [Electrochemical] and others to develop and market a similar emblem product.""), cannot remedy the deficiency of 
its allegations."
1001,5," While this action was sub judice, the parties briefed and argued an appeal by Park Electrochemical from a discovery ruling by 
Magistrate John L. Caden. In view of the result on this motion, the Court finds that that dispute is now moot. "

1041,2," According to the prefatory note to MARA, the act is based largely on the Uniform State Antitrust Act (USAA): The Michigan Antitrust Reform Act (""MARA"") is based largely on the Uniform State Antitrust Act promulgated by the 
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1973, and approved by the American Bar Association in 
1974.  Slight modifications were made to the USAA in 1979 although the Conference of Commissioners concluded that 
major revisions are not appropriate.  These comments indicated the source of each provision and the intent of the Council 
of the Antitrust Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan and the legislature in drafting MARA. "
1043,3,"  If state antitrust legislation is to form an integral part of our overall antitrust policy, the burden of compliance with the 
antitrust laws of the several states must be abated by the adoption of a uniform state antitrust act.  Existing state antitrust 
legislation is similar in many respects, but hardly can be called uniform.  This lack of uniformity coupled with the many 
drafting defects and substantive inadequacies found in some of the state legislation motivated the formulation of this 
proposed Uniform State Antitrust Act to mitigate the burdens of compliance. "
1048,1," LP&L was joined by other power plant plaintiffs, New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (including the City of New Orleans and a 
class of NOPSI electric ratepayers) and Gulf States Utilities Company, in a consolidated action which alleged breach of contract 
by United. These latter plaintiffs, however, made no antitrust claim, rather, only contract claims. The Gulf States Utilities 
Company case was settled during the trial, and, on August 24, 1984, the trial court found in favor of LP&L, and of NOPSI, on 
their contract claims against United. Damages were awarded in the LP&L case in the amount of $40,403,106 and in the NOPSI 
case in the amount of $44,403,106, both plus interest from the date of judicial demand. United has appealed the breach of 
contract findings and the amount of the damages, and the matter is currently pending before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal. "
1049,2," To prevent acts considered monopolistic (""forestalling,"" ""regrating,"" ""engrossing""), medieval lawmakers established regulations. 
And, as early as the fifteenth century, English courts enforced the rule that a person who sold his business with a non-
competitive agreement was not bound by the contract. Royal monopolies were attacked in the Case of the Monopolies in 1602 
and the Statute of Monopolies in 1623, and a common law rule emerged in the eighteenth century which allowed injured parties "

capacity to conspire in some courts. Other courts limited the reach of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine if the concerted 
action was aimed at subsidiaries or affiliates themselves as opposed to outsiders. Another judicial limitation on the doctrine 
occurred where the affiliated corporations had not held themselves out as competitors. Finally, applying an ""all the facts and 
circumstances"" test to determine whether a parent and its affiliated corporations were a single economic entity, some lower 
courts concluded, despite the doctrine, that a particular parent and its subsidiary were not independent entities capable of 
conspiring. Handler and Smart, The Present Status of the Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine, 3 Cardozo L. Rev. 23, 46-61

1054,18," Areeda, supra at 453. In dissent to Copperweld, Justice Stevens points to an economic justification of the rule of Yellow Cab. 
He notes that it permits anticompetitive agreements between affiliated corporations to be reached by § 1 in the case where the 
corporations have sufficient market power to restrain marketwide competition but not sufficient power to be considered 
monopolists in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. 102 S. Ct. at 2752."

1055,20," The Court did acknowledge, however, that initial acquisition of control of a subsidiary by a corporation would continue to be 
subject to scrutiny under § 1 of the Sherman Act."
1055,21," It has been suggested that the alternative statutory provisions proposed by the Court are not adequate. Since the required 
proof of § 2 monopoly power is based on a particular concentration-ratio within an industry and the ""attempt"" provision requires a 
showing of specific intent and a dangerous probability of success, § 2 of the Sherman Act does not reach restraints of trade by 
single firms which possess a lesser degree of monopoly power. Furthermore, the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) lacks the 
deterrent power of § 1 since private actions and treble damage awards are not permitted under that statute. And, entire 
industries are exempt from this Act, which is further said to be subject to political manipulation. Finally, the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15 (1973), is much more specialized than the more comprehensive Sherman Act. Note, The Demise of the Intra-

1055,22," This conclusion has been questioned. In addition to the difficulties in prosecuting and proving violations under the alternative 
theories, it was pointed out that in one case, Kiefer-Stewart v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 
L. Ed. 219 (1951), the alternative conspiracy theory suggested was not available at the time. Note, the Demise of the Intra-
Enterprise Conspiracy Doctrine: Flexible Antitrust Enforcement Policy Abandoned in a Maze of Economic Certainty - 
Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984), 60 Wash. L. Rev. 757, 
765 (1985). It was also pointed out by the dissent in Copperweld that while the majority attempted to explain the result in Yellow Cab as 
required by an unlawful acquisition of subsidiaries, the acquisitions were an additional consideration in that case. The majority's 
analogous treatment of United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 65 S. Ct. 254, 89 L. Ed. 160 (1944), 
furthermore, could not be squared with that decision's statement that such unlawful conduct was in addition to the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Thus, the dissenting opinion noted that the majority's observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same 
result . . . disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between 
affiliated entities, nor that today's holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. "
1056,23," In concluding that Tooke & Reynolds v. Bastrop Ice Co., Inc. was not relevant to the case at hand, the court of appeal 
asserted, erroneously in our view, that it ""stands only for the proposition that Louisiana law recognizes a cause of action based 
on allegations of conspiracy between a corporation and its shareholders, members, and managers to violate antitrust law."" 478

1056,24, See footnote 15 supra and accompanying text. 
1057,25," We note, however, that the application of a duty-risk analysis to antitrust litigation could be helpful in both minimizing 
inconsistent results and revealing the policies upon which the duty is based for legislative review. Flynn, Rethinking Sherman Act 
Section 1 Analysis: Three Proposals for Reducing the Chaos, 49 Antitrust L.J. 1593, 1619-33 (1980). As suggested by Flynn, the 
following analytical framework could be applied to antitrust litigation:"
1057,1, - Is there a factual connection between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant?
1057,2," - Do the policies of the antitrust laws and their system of protection extend to the interest that the plaintiff seeks to 
vindicate; and if some protection is afforded what standard of care does the legal system impose on the defendant?"
1057,3, - Was that standard of care breached by the defendant?
1057,4," - What are the damages? Although the factual connection issue is seldom litigated and the damage issue is simply one of proof, a specific judicial 
determination of the duty imposed by the antitrust laws (and the standard of proof of its breach), based on legislative purposes, 
precedents, insights from relevant disciplines such as economics, as well as circumstances of the case and fairness to the 
parties, would expose the antitrust issues involved to debate and add a greater predictability to a flexible approach, according to 
Flynn."
1057,26," A parent's control over its partially owned subsidiaries is in some measure limited by its fiduciary duty to other stockholders,

stockholders. Comment, The Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Doctrine After Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 86 
Colum. L. Rev. 198, 204 (1986). Furthermore, the parent with potential control may not exercise it legally if doing so would

externally imposed restraints such as contracts, consent decrees, regulations, laws, and foreign governments.  Id. at 205."

1058,28," The contract did, however, limit UGPL's obligation to provide natural gas to a maximum of 125,000,000 cubic feet in any one

1058,29," United Gas Corporation and Pennzoil merged in April of 1968, and this contract was signed on May 6, 1968. "
1059,30," Plaintiffs allege that defendants misled customers concerning the abundance of their supplies of gas through advertisements 
and otherwise; that defendants misled the Federal Power Commission through the use of false or deceptive statistics on Form 
15 reports; that defendants failed to inform regulators or customers of the illegal injection of interstate gas into the Louisiana 
intrastate system; and that the defendants continued to engage new sales obligations in the absence of a reliable gas supply."

] Monopoly power is defined as the ability to control prices or to exclude competition from the market.  United States v. E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391-92, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). It is strong evidence that 
monopoly power exists if prices are raised above competitive levels or if competitors are excluded from the market. Hjelmfelt, 
supra at 102. However, the jurisprudence has developed a shortcut formula. When the evidence is less than clear, control over 
the predominant share of the market has been found to infer the existence of monopoly power. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 
384 U.S. at 571."
1059,32," HN12[
] A relevant market is the ""area of effective competition,"" and it encompasses a product market as well as a 
geographic market.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 324, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). The 
geographic market is a section of the country, the area in which sellers of a particular product or service operate and to which 
buyers turn to purchase the product or service.  Tampa Elec. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 
(1961). The product market component of the relevant market, however, does not as readily lend itself to precise boundaries. 
Since cross-elasticity of demand, a measure of the willingness of purchasers to substitute one product for another is critical to a 
determination of the parameters of a product market, it is necessary to consider the differences among various commodities and 
the willingness of buyers to substitute one product for another. Hjelmfelt, supra at 108; United States v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours 
& Co., 351 U.S. at 394. With regard to their monopoly claim, LP&L defined a general geographic market as well as a geographic submarket. (The 
product market component of the relevant market was not specifically addressed by the plaintiff, no doubt because product 
substitution was not a viable alternative.) It was asserted that the general geographic market targeted by defendants' scheme 
was the entire State of Louisiana and that the submarket was the Baton Rouge - New Orleans industrial corridor where LP&L's 
Ninemile Point station is situated. LP&L's focus then is at and near the power plant site, and the statistics gathered by Mr. C. E. 
Collins, LP&L's engineering expert, involved natural gas sales in a 50 mile radius of the Ninemile Point station. The defendants dispute the appropriateness of LP&L's choice of the relevant market. Although there may be merit to some of 
their contentions, which would warrant our attention if the plaintiff had proved monopoly power in an inappropriate market, such 
is not the case here. Thus, in accord with the determination of the Court of Appeal, we need not address the correctness of 
LP&L's choice of relevant market. "
1060,33," In the usual situation, the ability to control prices indicates an ability to raise prices above a competitive level. In Tooke & 
Reynolds, the alleged monopolists lowered prices, but their control over price was used to drive a competitor out of the ice 
business, so that, without competition, they would then possess the power to raise prices above competitive levels."
1060,34," There exist significant barriers to entry in the natural gas industry: the existence of long term contracts that must expire, large 
capital expenditures, the acquisition of long term gas supplies, and even regulatory approval. And, from 1952 until 1968, UGPL 
was the only pipe line serving the generator at Ninemile Point."
1060,35," Donald Aswell, LP&L's vice-president for power production, testified that he was aware that in 1965 LP&L had threatened not 
to locate the proposed additional generation station at Ninemile Point unless United lowered its rates."
1060,36," During the 1960's, primarily before the Pennzoil takeover, UGPL released gas reserves, which had been secured earlier, while 
simultaneously expanding sales. When the nationwide gas shortage occurred, UGPL was not able to secure adequate supplies 
to meet its commitments. Defendants, United Gas and Pennzoil, point out, however, that they embarked on a major effort to 
acquire gas in the offshore Gulf of Mexico area (the Sea Robin Pipeline project) in 1967. "
1061,37," As stated by Justice Holmes in the federal jurisprudence, HN16[
] Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law seeks to prevent, - for instance, the 
monopoly, - but require further acts in addition to the mere forces of nature to bring that result to pass, an intent to bring it to 
pass is necessary in order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen.  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 
375, 396, [25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518] (1905). "
1062,38," It was at the close of LP&L's case that the trial judge, on defendants' motions for dismissal, dismissed plaintiff's causes of 
action insofar as violations of Louisiana's antitrust laws were alleged. Accordingly, upon reconsideration, if the Court of Appeal 
decides that plaintiff's evidence establishes a prima facie case of a violation of § 51:122, it will be necessary that the Court of 
Appeal remand the case to the district case for resumption of trial, with defendants being allowed to present their evidence."
1062,39," In accordance with 1983 La. Acts. No. 534 § 8, La. Code Civ. Pro. Art. 1810, directed verdicts, was amended to remove that 
portion of the article which did not deal with jury trials. Thus, it is Code Civ. Pro. art. 1672 which now governs involuntary 
dismissals in an action tried by a court without a jury, such as occurred in this case. "
1075,1," At the same time, the court denied a separate preliminary injunction motion brought by McCaw Communications of San 
Francisco, Inc. and McCaw Communications of San Jose, Inc., entities related to the plaintiff herein, based upon the impact of 
Pacific's acquisition of CI on the cellular telephone business in San Francisco and San Jose. McCaw Communications of San 
Francisco, Inc. v. The Pacific Telesis Group, C 85-4004 SW, Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, 
February 27, 1986."
1075,2," Paging is a one-way communications service in which customers are provided with small, portable radio units that typically emit 
a ""beep"" when signaled, alerting the user to call and receive a telephone message."
1075,3," There is no dispute between the parties that the appropriate product market is paging services, and that three distinct 
geographic markets, San Francisco, San Diego and Fresno are at issue in the case. "
1076,4," McCaw Communications Companies, Inc., an affiliate of plaintiff herein, does possess FCC paging licenses in these markets. 
However, plaintiff does not principally rely upon these licenses to support its claim of antitrust standing."
1076,5," Although Solinger was a Section 4 case, and thus arguably more restrictive than necessary for Section 16 purposes, it is 
nevertheless instructive on the standards to be applied when a prospective purchaser asserts standing to seek injunctive relief. "
1077,6," Plaintiff initially contends that the antitrust injury requirement is applicable only to claims for damages. However, the court sees 
no basis for limiting the Brunswick principle in such a manner."
1077,7," McCaw asserts that Pacific's ability to price at predatory levels would be enhanced by the possibility of cross-subsidization of 
its paging operations from its cellular business. This possibility, although not yet proven, lends further support to McCaw's claim 
of threatened antitrust injury."
1077,8, PUC decisions may be appealed to the California Supreme Court pursuant to Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 1756. 
1078,9," Indeed, the agency's conclusion of law on this subject states merely that ""the proposed acquisition is in the public interest and 
should be approved."" "
1086,1," Plaintiffs also challenge several evidentiary and interlocutory rulings made by the district court during and before trial.  Plaintiffs 
also challenge the district court's denial of class certification. "
1087,2," The provision states that the International President may: enter into, or authorize an I.V.P., representative or assistant to enter into, agreements with any national or international 
labor organization or association of employers, or with any company, corporation or firm doing an inter-state, or inter-
provincial business in electrical work, to cover the entire jurisdiction of the I.B.E.W."
1087,3," The section provides as follows: TThe [International President] or his representatives shall not enter into agreements affecting wages, hours and conditions 
of employment where local union agreement, covering such employment already exists, without first notifying at least thirty 
(30) days in advance of such agreements, the local unions so concerned or affected, in a district, and then only by 
procuring consent of a majority of the local unions in the district or the individual local union affected by this agreement. Article IV, section 3(13) was enacted by the 1962 IBEW convention and has not been formally amended, although in 1978, after 
this dispute arose, the IBEW Law Committee inserted the following annotation to section 3(13): When negotiating agreements with any national or international labor organization, or association of employers, or with any 
company, corporation or firm doing an inter-state, or inter-provincial business in electrical work, it is imperative that the I.P. 
have the authority to negotiate and enter into these agreements, or withdraw from these agreements, as circumstances so 
require."
1087,4," Paragraph 8.3 of the construction contract provides: In the event Bechtel or any of its subcontractors is or becomes a party to a collective bargaining agreement which pertains 
to the Work, Bechtel, after consultation with APS, shall negotiate and enter into a Project Labor Agreement with the union 
or unions involved in form and substance satisfactory to APS, which shall prevail over any such collective bargaining 
agreement. Such Project Labor Agreement shall incorporate such terms and conditions as are necessary or desirable to 
eliminate delays or work stoppages and excessive labor costs, including without limitation, featherbedding, makework, 
production limiting, inefficient or uneconomic work practices, slowdowns, strikes, picketing, handbilling, jurisdictional 
disputes, or any other labor difficulties which would impede the progress of the Work or increase the cost thereof, so as to 
enable Bechtel and its subcontractors to efficiently and economically utilize labor forces for the duration of the Work."
1087,5," BPC is a subsidiary of Bechtel and both will be referred to hereafter as ""Bechtel."" "
1088,6," As noted in Bhan v. NME Hospitals, Inc., 772 F.2d 1467, 1469-70 n.2 (9th Cir. 1985), ""What courts have referred to as antitrust 
standing is, however, subsumed within the inquiry into whether a plaintiff is a proper party to bring an antitrust action"" (citing 
Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n. 31, 74 L. Ed. 
2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983)). "
1089,7," Lucas' and Bigbey's claims actually involve loss of travel and subsistence allowances as well as loss of wages. For purposes of 
simplicity, we use only the term ""wages"" in this opinion. "
1090,8," For example, if Bechtel had not successfully negotiated the Stabilization Agreement and one of its competitors had been 
awarded the Palo Verde project, the competitor presumably would have paid its electricians at wage rates lower than those that 
Lucas and Bigbey would have received without the operation of the Stabilization Agreement.  In all probability, that would have 
been necessary for the competitor to secure the award.  Whether the electricians wages would have been higher than those 
under the Stabilization Agreement is conjectural.  To the extent that the competitor would pay higher wages, its profits (i.e. its 
damages) would be reduced.  Thus, in a sense, Lucas' and Bigbey's claim to higher wages is in conflict with a hypothetical 
competitor's claim to loss of profits.  We need not resolve this hypothetical problem, however, for we find that where Lucas' and 
Bigbey's injury is not the type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall, where their injury is so indirect and their harm so 
speculative, there can be no question that permitting their claim would severely strain the goal of keeping complex antitrust suits 
within judicially manageable limits. "
1091,9," They also argue that Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982), supports 
their position.  In McCready, the Supreme Court granted standing to a health insurance purchaser who alleged that her 
insurance carrier had conspired with psychiatrists to exclude psychologists from participating in the policy's coverage.  As a 
result, McCready had to pay for her psychologist's services separately.  Although McCready was not the ""target"" of the 
anticompetitive scheme, the Court found that she was within that area of the economy endangered by the anticompetitive 
conduct, and that her injury was ""inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists . . . . "" 
Id. at 484. In Associated General Contractors, the Court stressed that McCready was a consumer of psychotherapeutic services, that she 
had been injured by defendants' conspiracy to restrain competition in the market for such services, and that her injury was of a 
type Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws. 459 U.S. at 538. Thus, 
McCready does not lend much support, especially in light of the later-decided Associated General Contractors. "
1092,10," In their Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Lucas and 
Bigbey cite a ""review"" undertaken by the BCTD that indicates the Stabilization Agreement alters certain contractual provisions 
contained in the Inside Agreement.  These provisions relate to such matters as grievance procedures, crew sizes, selection of 
foremen, and several wage issues.  Nowhere do Lucas and Bigbey claim they were injured by any provisions but those affecting 
pay. "
1093,11," Prior to trial, the district court decided two questions of law regarding the damages plaintiffs could seek at trial.  First, the court 
held that plaintiffs could not seek punitive damages on their section 301 claims.  Second, the Court ruled that because plaintiffs 
had not complied with the local rule requiring detailed itemization of damages, they could not recover for Bechtel's alleged failure 
to make payments into two local union trust funds. The court also excluded as inadmissible hearsay notes of a Bechtel manager. "
1095,12," We do not need to consider the additional grounds relied on by the district court, that Bechtel reasonably believed the 
President had authority.  We note, however, that the record does not provide any substantial evidence that Bechtel had "
1096,," knowledge that the IBEW constitution prohibited the President from entering into the Stabilization Agreement without local 
approval. Local 640 failed to mount a formal challenge to the President's authority until after the execution of the Agreement by 
Bechtel. "
1103,1," After these actions were filed in 1978, all defendants moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted, each asserting the state action exemption. These motions to dismiss were denied in the 
original district court opinion, 461 F.Supp. at 1031-33. On May 24, 1985. the Court issued an Order stating that it would 
reconsider these motions in light of subsequent authority. All parties submitted new briefs. On June 28, 1985, the private 
defendants--Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., Yellow Cab of Dallas, Inc., and Fort Worth Cab & Baggage Company, Inc.--moved for 
summary judgment under Rule 56, asserting the state action exemption and Noerr-Pennington immunity. The issues concerning the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984 were raised by the Court in an Order issued December 6, 
1984. In response to that Order, each party filed papers addressing the applicability of the Act's provisions. "
1110,2," As an alternative ground for dismissal, this analysis proceeds as though the state action exemption did not apply, thus making 
the availability of alternative relief a reality. "
1118,1," Since April 1, 1985, Bailey Specialties has sold specialties only through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Bailey Specialties No. 1, 
Inc. in Summerville. Bailey Specialties' insulation business is done under the trade name Gulf Atlantic Insulators (GAI). Gulf 
Atlantic Insulators, Inc. is a named defendant that was dissolved in 1983."
1118,2," Plaintiffs allege that this also violates the price discrimination provisions of HN5[
] § 13(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 13(f), which provides in pertinent part that ""it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to induce or receive a 
discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section."" "
1124,1," Since both parties agree that Counts III, IV, VI, and VII of the original complaint should be dismissed, the Court will confine its 
consideration only to those claims asserted in Counts I (Robinson Patman § 2a), II (Sherman Act § 2), and III (T.C.A. § 47-25-
109). "
1128,1," Burdette Tomlin is a small non-teaching community hospital. It had 171 beds in 1979, and 239 beds as of January 1984. It is 
located in Cape May Courthouse, New Jersey, and is the only hospital in Cape May County."
1128,2," Two separate cases, Civil Action Nos. 83-0794 and 84-1790 were consolidated for trial by this court. Dr. Nanavati is the plaintiff 
in Civil Action No. 83-0794 and the defendant-counter-claimant-plaintiff in Civil Action No. 84-1790. Dr. Sorenson is the plaintiff 
in Civil Action No. 84-1790 and the defendant-counter-claimant-plaintiff in Civil Action No. 83-0794. The Hospital and the 
Executive Committee are the defendants-counter-claimant-plaintiffs in Civil Action No. 83-0794."
1128,3," BTMH and the Executive Committee, by motion filed July 25, 1986, request this Court to ""mold"" the antitrust verdict. Since, 
however, judgment was entered on the jury's verdict on July 23, 1986, two days prior to the filing of this motion, said motion shall 
be denied as moot."
1128,4," To be noted is that Dr. Nanavati was, some time thereafter, at the urging of the Executive Committee, granted one day's 
reading of EKG's and at present has 3 days readings, as much as anyone else. "
1129,5," The Chancery Division's finding that Dr. Nanavati had not been accorded his rights with respect to a full hearing of the charges 
was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey. Nanavati v. Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital et 
al., No. A-3702-84T7, slip op. at 2 (App. Div. March 7, 1976) (per curiam)."
1129,6," Dr. Nanavati's discrimination claim originally also included a claim for discrimination due to race or national origin, pursuant to 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. At the conclusion of Dr. Nanavati's proofs, a motion for a 
directed verdict on this Title VII claim was made by the Hospital. In an opinion and order filed June 23, 1986, this Court granted 
the motion on the ground that Dr. Nanavati, as a physician, was an independent contractor rather than an employee, and as 
such, his discrimination claim was not within the ambit of Title VII. In that same opinion, the Court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
50, took the defendants' motion for directed verdict with respect to Dr. Nanavati's § 1981 claim under advisement, thereby 
affording Dr. Nanavati the opportunity of demonstrating, to the jury's satisfaction, that his contractual rights were impaired by the 
defendants' intentional racial discrimination."
1129,7, A copy of these special interrogatories and the jury's responses thereto is attached to this opinion as appendix A. 
1131,8," Dr. Nanavati urges that we improperly allowed Dr. Sorenson to supplement the pleadings to assert a defamation claim based 
on the alleged statement to Ms. O'Neil. We ruled upon this issue in our ad litem opinion of July 10, 1986, a copy of which is 
attached hereto as appendix B, and we rely upon the discussion therein in rejecting Dr. Nanavati's contention here. We conclude 
now, as we did then, that the pleadings were properly supplemented to include the alleged statement to Anne O'Neil as part of 
Dr.  Sorenson's defamation case."
1131,9," The ""so shallow"" statement was contained in an Atlantic City Press article published on May 7, 1983 entitled ""Dr. To Fight Until 
Reinstated,"" written by William Watson, and admitted as Defendants' Exhibit 1296."
1131,10," More than three weeks after the verdict was returned in this case, counsel for Dr. Nanavati informed the Court that Exhibit 
1297, the May 10, 1983 Atlantic City Press article, mistakenly had attached to it a page of the May 11, 1983 Sun article which 
contained the above-noted alleged defamatory statements. See transcript of August 14, 1986 at pp. 4-8. Counsel for Dr. 
Sorenson, at oral argument on the present motions, explained that this mistake was of no consequence because the sole bases 
for Dr. Sorenson's defamation claims were the allegedly slanderous statements to reporter Watson, reporter Russell, and nurse 
O'Neil. Transcript of August 14, 1986 at pp. 22 & 29. Counsel stressed that Dr. Sorenson did not pursue, as part of his 
defamation claim, the allegedly libelous statements contained in the May 10, 1983 Press article or the May 11, 1983 Sun article. "
1132,," Id. We shall hold Dr. Sorenson to the representations of his counsel, and we shall proceed with the understanding that Dr.  
Sorenson's defamation claim is an action for slander."
1132,11," The statements at issue here, by reason of the fact that they impugn the defamation plaintiffs in their business and profession, 
constitute slander per se. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 573 (1981); W. Page Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of 
Torts, § 112, pp. 788, 790-92 (5th ed. 1984). The fact that they are defamatory per se, however, does not obviate the need to 
establish, to the jury's satisfaction, that the statements were understood to be defamatory. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 
563. Instead, characterizing the statements as slander per se merely relieves the defamation plaintiffs from having to prove 
special damages. Restatement (Second) of Torts, §§ 570 & 573. "
1133,12," Dr. Nanavati also contends that the allegedly defamatory statements made to these reporters, as reported in The Sun article, 
are not actionable because they are mere repetitions of earlier statements, which statements are now not actionable by 
operation of the statute of limitations. We find this argument unpersuasive. Each republication of a defamatory statement 
constitutes a separate publication, and gives rise to a separate cause of action. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 578, com. 
b. See also id. at § 576; Toanone v. Williams, 405 F. Supp. 36, 38 (E.D. Pa. 1975) (applying Pennsylvania law); W. Page 
Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, § 113 at p. 799 (5th ed. 1984)."
1133,13," A very substantial question regarding the ""opinion"" status of the statement at issue is raised with respect to whether or not the 
statement can fairly be said to imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts. See slip op. of July 10, 1986, at pp. 4-8."
1133,14," The jury was charged, in pertinent part: Now, with regard to awarding punitive damages, members of the jury, I must inform you that the defamation claims made 
against Dr. Nanavati require a special showing of the strength of the evidence before you may award punitive damages. To 
award punitive damages to either the hospital or Dr. Sorensen [sic] based on what Dr. Nanavati said about them which you 
find to be defamatory, you must find by clear and convincing evidence that Dr. Nanavati made the defamatory 
communications [sic] knowing that it was false or in reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. Clear and convincing evidence is that evidence which produces in the minds of the jurors a firm belief or conviction as to 
the truth of the allegations sought to be established. That is evidence so clear, direct and convincing as to enable the jury to 
come to a clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts in issue. With respect to reckless disregard of the truth of [sic] falsity, if you find that Dr. Nanavati entertained serious doubts about 
the truth of his statements about the hospital or Dr. Sorensen [sic] then you must find that he made them with reckless 
disregard as to their truth or falsity. "
1134,," Tr. of July 15, 1986 at pp. 55-56."
1134,15," The jury's finding regarding the existence of ""constitutional malice"" obviates the need for protracted discussion of another of 
Dr.  Nanavati's asserted bases for new trial. This Court, during trial, ruled that Dr. Sorenson and the Hospital were not public 
figures for purposes of their defamation claims against Dr. Nanavati. Dr. Nanavati claims, herein, that this ruling constituted 
prejudicial error, requiring a new trial. The jury found, however, that Dr. Nanavati made the defamatory statements with 
constitutional malice -- with knowledge of the falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the statements. Thus even if 
the jury had been instructed that Dr. Sorenson and the Hospital were public figures, liability would nonetheless have attached. In 
short, accepting, arguendo, that our ruling regarding the public figure status of these defamation plaintiffs was erroneous, it still 
cannot be said to have prejudiced Dr.  Nanavati in defending the claims against him."
1134,16," Dr. Nanavati has also asserted, on this motion, that the Hospital failed to prove special damages on its defamation claim. We 
held, in our ad litem opinion of July 10, 1986, that such proof was not required and therefore we do not address this contention 
here."
1134,17," Indeed, there is some cause for doubt whether the Hospital's defamation claim had even accrued at the time the Hospital filed 
its counterclaim in the state court action. "
1135,18," Dr. Nanavati also contends that the awards made to Dr. Sorenson on his business interference claim, as well as those to Dr. 
Sorenson, the Hospital, and its Executive Committee on the defamation claims, were so excessive as to require a new trial. We 
cannot agree, and shall deny Dr.  Nanavati's request for a new trial based on that contention. With respect to the punitive 
damages awarded, testimony was adduced to show that Dr.  Nanavati has a net worth in excess of $1,622,410.00, tr. of July 7, 
1986 at p. 65, and an annual gross income approaching $500,000.00. Tr. of July 7, 1986 at p. 30. On this record, we cannot say 
that the awards made are excessive. "
1136,19," The most significant of these alleged legal errors was this Court's decision, as set forth in our ad litem opinion of June 24, 
1986, allowing Dr. Nanavati to amend his pleadings, at the close of his case, to name the Hospital and the Executive Committee 
as defendants on the antitrust claim. Although we consider this allegation of error somewhat questionable, particularly in light of 
the antitrust defendants' refusal to accept the opportunity afforded them to cure potential prejudice at the time of trial, see slip 
op. of June 24, 1986 at pp. 6-7 (D.N.J.), we need not rule upon this issue. Because we hold that judgment in favor of the 
Hospital and the Executive Committee must be entered, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, this assertion of prejudicial error, like 
the others pertaining to the antitrust claim, is moot. "
1137,20," Our authority to attempt such a determination, given the parties' decision not to submit a special interrogatory which 
specifically asked the jury whether persons who were not named as defendants in the action participated in the alleged 
conspiracy, cannot seriously be disputed in light of Fed. R. Civ. P. 49, which provides for express fact-finding by the trial court 
when the parties have failed to properly submit any issue to the jury."
1137,21," Of course, in light of the record here, we cannot help but consider the possibility that the jury in this case, after 8 weeks of trial 
and 4 days of deliberation, reached a compromise in the verdict."
1137,22," Dr. Nanavati was permitted, when allowed to amend his complaint, to include an antitrust claim under New Jersey law, 
N.J.S.A. § 56:9-1 et seq., as well as federal law. See slip op. of June 24, 1986 (D.N.J.) at p. 2, n.2. For purposes of the present 
motion, however, no party has argued that any difference exists between the state law and the federal law, and therefore we 
need not differentiate between these claims."
1137,23," We have not identified, nor have the parties urged us to find, any legally significant difference between the full medical staff, 
the defendant at issue in Weiss, and the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff, the defendant entity at issue here."
1137,24," Although there is an apparent difference between the decision-making process employed at the hospital involved in Weiss, 
where the medical staff makes privilege decisions, and that at BTMH, where the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff is 
empowered only to make recommendations regarding staff privileges, none of the parties has argued that Weiss is 
distinguishable by virtue of this difference, and we attach no legal significance thereto. See generally, Kissam, Webber, Bigers 
and Holzgraefe, Antitrust and Hospital Privileges: Testing the Conventional Wisdom, 70 Calif. L. Rev. 595, 603-613 (1982)."
1137,25," The jury was charged, in pertinent part: ""In order to prove the first element Dr. Nanavati must prove that two or more distinct entities agreed to take action against 
him. Bear in mind that the hospital and its medical staff cannot conspire between and among themselves in violation of the 
Sherman Act."" "
1138,," Tr. of July 15, p. 29, lines 7-12; Tr. of July 16, p. 6, lines 6-11. No exception was taken to this portion of the charge."
1138,26," The language used by the Weiss court arguably suggests this result, since the court stated that "". . . any action taken by the 
medical staff satisfies the 'contract combination, or conspiracy' requirement of section 1."" 745 F.2d at 814 (emphasis added). 
The present case is clearly distinguishable from Weiss, of course, in that the circumstances of Weiss, wherein osteopathic 
doctors, as a class, were purportedly excluded from admission to a medical staff by the allopathic doctors already on the staff, 
presented, in contrast to the circumstances of this case, a situation rife with economic competition."
1138,27," The legitimacy of the formation of an executive committee of the medical staff and the delegation of authority to that committee 
to recommend decisions regarding staff privileges is beyond dispute."
1138,28," Indeed, even the existence of a potential for economic gain by the Executive Committee members cannot be found in this 
record. No direct economic incentive to stifle competition existed, since none of these physicians practiced cardiology, and no 
indirect economic incentive of any kind was proven. "
1139,29," As a factual matter, we note that Dr. Nanavati, by virtue of his attainment of a temporary restraining order -- and then a 
permanent injunction -- from the New Jersey Superior Court, was without staff privileges for only 5 days."
1139,30," The Hospital excepted to this point of the charge, tr. of July 15, 1986 at p. 77, lines 5-11, and despite the fact that this charge 
had been submitted by plaintiff as a proposed point for charge, and that the Hospital had not previously objected, informed this 
Court during oral argument on the present motion that it was surprised to hear this point in the jury instructions. Tr. of August 14, "
1140,1986," at p. 63. Defendants also argued on this motion, for the first time, that plaintiff was required to identify the specific 
conspirators who were not named defendants. See defendants' supplemental brief at p. 5. Our holding here is based upon the 
lack of factual support for a finding that any such independent co-conspirator existed, not upon a change in belief with respect to 
the accuracy of the charge as a statement of the law. We do not reach defendants' assertions regarding a need for plaintiff to 
specifically identify unnamed conspirators."
1140,31," No objection or challenge to our ruling on the issue of the appropriate approach to analyzing anticompetitive behavior in the 
circumstances of this case, as discussed in our July 8, 1986 ad litem opinion, a copy of which is attached hereto as appendix C, 
has been raised on the present motion."
1140,32," We do not reach the issue whether sufficient evidence was adduced to sustain a verdict based upon this inference. Whether 
the alleged decrease in referrals was in fact the product of concerted activity by the other physicians, and whether any 
physician's decision to decrease referrals was based on reasons which were not legitimate, are, of course, issues properly within 
the jury's province. "
1141,1," In that Opinion, we granted Dr. Nanavati's motion to amend the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15, to include Burdette 
Tomlin Memorial Hospital and the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff as antitrust defendants because, inter alia, these 
parties had notice of the allegations, and thereby were not prejudiced by allowing the amendment. "
1145,2," It is, however, arguable that BTMH, in essence, advertised its services, either explicitly or implicitly, and therefore should be 
deemed a public figure only with respect to comment on its advertising. See Steaks Unlimited, Inc. v. Deaner, 623 F.2d 264, 
272-73 (3d Cir. 1980). However, in the absence of any proofs regarding BTMH's advertising, if any, we are unprepared to hold 
that they injected themselves into the public spotlight on the issue of patient care. "
1151,1," The jury specifically found NFL Commissioner Alvin R. Rozelle not liable on the USFL's claim of actual monopolization. See 
Court Exhibit 16 at 4 (Question No. 6). "
1152,2, Plaintiffs have not challenged the jury's finding that NFL Commissioner Rozelle was not liable on any of the USFL's claims. 
1154,3," Although the out-of-court declarations proffered by plaintiffs are inadmissible, it is far from clear even from the statements cited 
by plaintiffs that any jury confusion existed, or that the verdicts and the damages awarded were the result of anything besides 
the legitimate process by which a jury reaches a consensus. For example, although juror Sanchez may have believed that the 
USFL could be awarded additional damages by this Court or by some other agency, her statements to the media, as quoted in 
plaintiffs' papers, also demonstrate that this expectation was not material to her verdict and that the jury's award of nominal 
damages was attributable to the failings in plaintiffs' damages proof. See, e.g., Myerson Aff., Ex. 26 (""We couldn't compute the "
1155,," damages . . . [because] it was so complicated and we did not feel that [the] economy could be . . . visualized on future 
damages.""). Moreover, statements by other jurors, also included in plaintiffs' papers, confirm that any misconception regarding 
the jury's exclusive responsibility for determining damages was not a part of the jury's deliberations. See Myerson Aff., Ex. 27 
(statements of jurors Lilienfeld and Sibilia)."
1155,4," To the extent that Rule 49(b) does apply to the USFL's argument that a new trial is warranted because of inconsistencies 
among the jury's verdicts, plaintiffs have waived their right to invoke that rule's protection by failing to raise the question of 
inconsistency before the jury was discharged. See discussion infra slip op. at 20-21. In any event, for reasons set forth infra slip 
op. at 14-18, I have rejected plaintiffs' argument that the verdicts are fundamentally inconsistent. "
1156,5," The phrase ""Porter presentation"" came to be accepted during the trial as a shorthand reference to a presentation given by a 
Harvard Business School professor to a group of NFL-associated persons in which the professor directly suggested the use of 
certain tactics as part of an overall strategy to ""conquer the USFL."" At trial, defendants conceded that several of these 
suggested tactics, if they had actually been carried out, would have constituted a violation of the federal antitrust laws.  
Defendants also, however, offered a considerable amount of evidence designed to prove that the NFL never implemented any of 
the invidious features of the Porter presentation, and in fact disavowed the presentation as soon as it recognized its implications. "
1157,6," Moreover, no objection was made to the Court's delimitation of plaintiffs' allegations of unlawful conduct constituting a § 1 
conspiracy. See Court Exhibit G at 94."
1157,7," Although the Jury Verdict Sheet & Interrogatories, Court Exhibit No. 16, used in this case does not exactly coincide with the 
format described in Rule 49(b), both plaintiffs and defendants are in basic agreement that the interrogatories submitted to the 
jury are authorized and governed by the terms of that rule. See Stanton v. Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., 718 F.2d 553, 
574-75 (3d Cir. 1983) (where the interrogatories required the jury as a practical matter to arrive at a general verdict, and where 
the jury was charged on legal as well as factual matters, the jury was put on notice that they were responsible for rendering a 
general verdict on defendants' liability, and their answers to the interrogatories were governed by Rule 49(b)). "
1158,8," Plaintiffs argue that they preserved their Rule 49 claim of inconsistency by raising it in their motion for a new trial. See Cone v. 
Beneficial Standard Life Ins. Co., 388 F.2d 456, 460 (8th Cir. 1968); but see Ludwig v. Marion Laboratories, Inc., 465 F2d 114, 
118 (8th Cir. 1972) (approving waiver rule and suggesting that Cone is ambiguous authority in the Eighth Circuit). The problem, 
of course, is that by the time the objecting party has raised the issue of inconsistency in its written motion, the trial court has lost 
the opportunity to resubmit the interrogatories to the jury, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(b). Plaintiffs maintain that Rule 49 (b) is still 
usable under such circumstances, since the rule's disjunctive character gives the trial court the alternative of ordering a new trial. 
See Plaintiffs' New Trial Reply Memorandum at 16. This argument is specious -- when only one of two alternatives is left, no 
choice exists.  The USFL's construction of Rule 49 eliminates the rule's incentives for efficient trial procedure and opens the door 
to the possible misuse of the rule's procedures by parties anxious to circumvent an unsatisfactory jury verdict by procuring a new 
trial. Cf.  Skillin, 643 F.2d at 19-20. "
1159,9," Plaintiffs' further argument that a new trial is warranted because the trial court's charge on nominal damages was in error is 
considered infra slip op. at 26-32."
1159,10," In moving for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. on certain of the jury's verdicts, plaintiffs make numerous claims of error 
regarding this Court's instructions to the jury. It is not my purpose in this opinion, however, to review the entire jury charge or all 
of plaintiffs' objections to its contents, especially since those objections which were timely raised were previously considered by 
this Court at the time the jury charge was prepared. Nonetheless, because it is so obviously material to the outcome of this trial, I 
consider it worthwhile to discuss the questions raised by the charge to the jury on antitrust damages. "
1162,11," Plaintiffs argue that their overall objection to the Court's damages charge was sufficient to preserve a challenge to the charge 
on nominal damages. See Plaintiffs' New Trial Memorandum at 12 n.**; Plaintiff's New Trial Reply Memorandum at 8 n.**. The 
obligation of a party objecting to a proposed jury instruction, however, is to ""stat[e] distinctly the matter to which he objects and 
the grounds of his objection."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 (emphasis added). "
1163,12," One of the business decisions that the USFL made, not necessarily related to its desire to force a merger with the NFL, was to 
file an antitrust lawsuit against the established league. When a firm which has committed myriad blunders in the marketplace 
seeks to gain benefits through treble damages that it could not acquire through fair competition, neither juries nor courts should 
be condemned for obstructing such an effort. Cf.  Argus Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 801 F.2d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1986) (affirming 
grant of summary judgment in favor of a defendant that had been sued by a plaintiff that had been publicly ""searching for the 
means of entering the antitrust fray"")."
1163,13," The jury was also told that they could award nominal damages if ""plaintiffs failed to prove an amount of damages."" Charge at 
124. Before and during trial, the NFL argued that the testimony of plaintiffs' damages expert, Dr. Nina W. Cornell, ""was so 
thoroughly riddled with false and unfounded assumptions, and was so speculative in its very nature, as to amount to no proof of 
any amount of damages."" Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for New Trial and for Judgment N.O.V. 
on Certain Claims at 31. For example, defendants argued that Dr. Cornell's damages calculations were based on the flawed 
assumption that the experience of the American Football League in the 1960's could be used to predict USFL revenues in the 
1980's. Id. The jury in this case may have agreed with the NFL that Dr. Cornell's testimony was based on unsound assumptions and 
therefore have concluded that plaintiffs had simply failed to prove an amount of damages. This plausible explanation for the "
1164,," jury's award of nominal damages offers yet another reason for refusing to grant plaintiffs a new trial based on the inadequacy of 
the award. "
1166,14," Defendants have argued that since the jury verdict sheet did not include an interrogatory asking the jury whether the 
defendants had willfully acquired or maintained monopoly power by means of anticompetitive or predatory conduct, the jury 
could have found defendants liable based upon entirely lawful conduct. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for 
Judgment N.O.V. on Monopolization of ""Professional Football"" at 21-22.  This argument carries little weight, since the jury was 
instructed that with respect to the actual monopolization claim one of the elements they had to find by a preponderance of the 
evidence was that defendants actually acquired or maintained the monopoly through anticompetitive conduct. See Charge at 31."
1166,15," At a minimum, the jury was allowed to consider defendants' television-related behavior, even if entirely lawful, as probative of 
the ""purpose and character"" of the remainder of NFL conduct under the jury's scrutiny. Cf.  UMW v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 
670-71 n.3, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965) (citation omitted). "
1171,1," Although one of Carthage Airways' shareholders, Eugene Ingram, is also named as a plaintiff, it is clear that any claims he 
might assert would pre-date July, 1966, when Carthage Airways was incorporated. Those claims were barred by the applicable 
four year statute of limitations at the time this suit was filed, see 15 U.S.C. § 15b, and thus will not be considered further."
1171,2," A class composed of all Cessna dealers - zone and contracted (see definitions, infra) - was originally certified. In August, 1983, 
my predecessor narrowed the class to its present configuration. "
1172,3," Plaintiffs' prayer also includes a request for injunctive relief. At some unidentified point before this case proceeded to trial, 
however, Cessna completed its elimination of the ""Cessna distributor"" (see definitions, infra) portion of its distribution network. 
Since the functioning of that ""Cessna distributor"" system formed the whole basis for plaintiffs' claims, the request for injunctive 
relief is now moot."
1172,4," As noted elsewhere, some FBOs from time to time became ""zone dealers"" or ""contracted dealers"" by virtue of entering into the 
necessary contract with Cessna or a Cessna distributor, and from time to time lost that status by virtue of not renewing the 
contract. "
1173,5," The witnesses and parties have referred to these entities as ""independent distributors."" I have chosen to substitute the present 
term in order to avoid any perception or suggestion that there was a relationship between such entities and ""independent 
dealers,"" infra."
1173,6," Defendants advance a suggestion that the use of an aircraft in such activities would amount to a ""resale by the hour"" (or on 
whatever other basis the owner's charges were fixed). I feel obliged to reject that idea as a matter of law, however ingenious it 
may be and even though some of plaintiffs' witnesses agreed with it. So far as I can determine, when the Robinson-Patman Act "
1174,," refers to ""resale"" it refers to a sale in the conventional sense, as distinguished from ""use"" or ""consumption"" (words it also 
employs). Compare General Motors Corp., 3Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) para. 22,165, at 23,021 to 23,023 (1984) (a § 2(d) decision, 
but still applicable here, see fn. 10 infra). "
1176,7," Section 2(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), as immediately pertinent, reads as follows: HN2[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale 
within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. "
1177,8," While Cessna ordinarily sold new aircraft, it also occasionally sold ""factory demonstrator"" or ""zone demonstrator"" aircraft. 
Presumably those aircraft would often be ""used,"" as that term has been defined in this opinion."
1177,9," Some commentators have apparently viewed § 2(a) as limited to purchases made for the purpose of resale or distribution. See 
III Kintner and Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law 299 (1983); 5 Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation 30-44 (1986). 
The statute, however, uses the words ""use, consumption, or resale. . . ."" I can certainly see that a purchase of salt for 
""consumption"" or ""use"" by a family does not implicate ""competition"" at the purchaser's level; but a business ""use"" and perhaps 
even a business ""consumption"" might arguably be something else again. The point, however, is academic as far as this case is 
concerned, for the reasons stated in the text."
1177,10," General Motors Corp. is a decision under § 2(d) of the Act. That section is rather clearly limited to situations involving the 
resale of products, see General Motors Corp. at 23,021 and authorities cited; and of course the ruling in the case was made in 
that context. It is, as noted in fn. 9, supra, less clear that § 2(a) is limited in that fashion. Whatever the theoretical boundaries of § 
2(a) may be, however, I am, for the reasons pointed out in the text, concerned only with aircraft which were purchased for 
resale, and I thus believe General Motors is applicable - and persuasive - authority on the present point. "
1178,11," See generally III Kintner and Bauer, supra § 21.17; 4 Von Kalinowski, supra § 24.03[3]. In this case, where Cessna's pricing 
for aircraft generally remained the same throughout the current model year for each model of aircraft; where no one suggests 
that the price differential in question was related in any fashion to the time of sale by Cessna; where planes often were not sold 
for several months after their acquisition by a dealer; and where there is no indication that customer preference was affected by 
any time factor other than that of current model year, I find as a general matter that all sales of the same model aircraft, made 
within the current model year for such aircraft, would meet the ""contemporaneous sales"" requirement. Obviously, however, the 
timing of a given aircraft purchase might directly impact a plaintiff's ability to show actual injury caused by a Cessna distributor's 
alleged sale ""in competition"" with that plaintiff, as where the distributor's sale preceded the plaintiff's purchase."
1178,12," See, e.g., Tri-State Broadcasting Co. v. United Press Int'l, Inc., 369 F.2d 268, 269-70 (5th Cir. 1966) (transfer under an agency 
or consignment agreement not a ""sale""); L & L Oil Co., Inc. v. Murphy Oil Corp., 674 F.2d 1113, 1120-21 (5th Cir. 1982) (refusal 
to deal not a ""sale""); Export Liquor Sales, Inc. v. Ammex Warehouse Co., 426 F.2d 251, 252 (6th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 
U.S. 1000, 27 L. Ed. 2d 451, 91 S. Ct. 460 (1971) (lease not a ""sale""); South End Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 237 F. Supp. 650, 652 
(N.D. Ill. 1965) (offer to sell not a ""sale""). "
1179,13," The functional discounts granted on equipment, although greater for distributors than for dealers, were different in amount 
than the discount on the basic aircraft. Accordingly, depending upon how a given aircraft was ultimately equipped for resale, the 
total discount differential might vary slightly from the five or six percent figure for the basic aircraft."
1179,14," Whether Moog stands for the proposition that when the price differential is a discount that relates to the entire ""line,"" rather 
than differences in the items themselves, it is necessary only to find two (or more) competing buyers who have purchased 
contemporaneously from the ""line"" (even if the items purchased are different) (the idea that the ""line"" is itself the ""commodity""), 
or instead whether, even under Moog, it is still necessary that there be at least two competing buyers who have each 
contemporaneously purchased at least one identical item from the ""line,"" I do not know. "
1180,15," The evidence makes clear that non-current aircraft did not ordinarily compete with current aircraft at any level: that is, the two 
were not viewed as equivalents by purchasers, and different prices were charged for each both on sale and on resale. In part, it 
appears, this was the result of actual physical changes made in aircraft from one model year to the next, and in part was simply 
the result of buyer perceptions and preferences. The same point has been noted with automobile sales, although in connection 
with the Act's ""contemporaneous sales"" requirement. See Valley Plymouth v. Studebaker-Packard Corporation, 219 F. Supp. 
608, 610-11 (S.D. Cal. 1963). In any event, whether one considers that current and non-current aircraft were commodities not of 
like grade and quality, or instead simply that Cessna's sales of current and non-current aircraft cannot meet the Act's 
contemporaneous sales requirement, the end result is the same: such sales will not satisfy the ""analogous transactions"" 
rationale that underlies both aspects of § 2(a). Id."
1180,16," There are, as a reading of the section demonstrates, actually three (or four) ""in commerce"" clauses in § 2(a). See III Kintner 
and Bauer, supra 145; 4 Von Kalinowski, supra § 26.01. The present question technically relates only to the third such clause, 
although at least in the present sort of case a satisfaction of that third clause will ordinarily dictate a finding that the other clauses 
are also satisfied. III Kintner and Bauer, supra 145-46; 4 Von Kalinowski, supra 26-16."
1180,17," Representative Utterback cautioned that the exemption for purchases in intrastate commerce is not important for practical purposes [since the manufacturer] may not sell to a mass buyer at discriminatory prices for 
delivery within the State and shipment then to other States, since such sales are, by long-settled law, interstate commerce. "
1181,18," Where goods are moved from out of state to an instate wholesaler for redistribution in state, the flow stops when the goods 
reach that wholesaler, unless the goods were purchased by the wholesaler (a) to fill a specific order; (b) under a contract or 
understanding by which the wholesaler has agreed to fill the needs of a particular customer; or (c), to fill the anticipated needs of 
a particular customer even though no contract or understanding to do so exists. See Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 
564, 567-70, 87 L. Ed. 460, 63 S. Ct. 332 (1943); Burke v. Ford, 377 F.2d 901, 904 (10th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 389 
U.S. 320, 19 L. Ed. 2d 554, 88 S. Ct. 443 (1968); 4 Von Kalinowski, supra § 26.02[3][b]."
1181,19," During the period in question, in fact, all Cessna distributors except for one (Skyliners) were located outside the state of 
Kansas.  Plaintiffs apparently make no claim that Skyliners sold in competition with them, or at least have adduced no proof of 
that fact."
1181,20," In contrast to the position taken in H.A.B. Chemical Co., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 1981-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) § 63,912 at 
75,749 (C.D. Cal. 1980), I do not consider that ""third line"" and ""fourth line"" claims, see generally Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 
U.S. 642, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599, 89 S. Ct. 1871 (1969), are also an exception to the general rule mentioned above. Those claims are 
allowed because of § 2(a)'s express reference to discriminatory effects which ""may . . . injure, destroy or prevent competition 
with any person who either grants or receives the benefit of such discrimination, or [competition] with customers of either of them 
""(emphasis added). Under this language, and under the construction given it in Perkins, 395 U.S. at 646, 647, claims which 
involve injury to a ""customer"" of a disfavored buyer are allowed without regard to the number of sales ""levels"" that separate the 
""customer"" from the discriminatorily priced sale (or, more precisely, the number of sales levels that separate the favored "
1182,," ""customer"" from the discriminating seller, III Kintner and Bauer, supra at 315 n. 289). Nonetheless, unless the exception noted in 
the text applies, or some new exception is recognized, both the ""favored"" sale and the ""disfavored"" sale must have been made 
directly by the alleged discriminating seller."
1182,21," Plaintiffs also seek to support their argument with a citation to Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 642, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599, 89 
S. Ct. 1871. Perkins simply held, as applied to this case, that there is, in a causal relationship sense, no artificial limit to the 
number of sales levels which may separate an injured ""customer"" of a disfavored buyer from a discriminating seller. See fn. 20 
supra. For the reasons stated in fn. 20, I do not believe Perkins has any direct bearing upon the present question."
1182,22," Section 2(d) reads as follows: (d) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for 
the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any 
services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for 
sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or 
consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products 
or commodities. "
1183,23," The evidence, in the form of various complaints to Cessna, makes clear that Cessna had such notice, at least as a general 
matter. "
1184,24," Cessna, of course, had no legal way of controlling the prices charged by Cessna distributors. It could, on the other hand, 
obviously control the prices which it charged those distributors. The requirement noted in the text amounts to no more than 
requiring it to exercise that ability. "
1185,25," Plaintiffs' offer of some 387 aircraft sales files and sales tickets maintained by Walston Aviation, Inc. (a contracted dealer 
located in East Alton, Illinois), for the purpose of showing dealer sales to other dealers, falls far short of the mark. In the first 
place, the available evidence does not in many instances even allow me to find that the purchasers were in fact dealers, and I 
cannot of course simply accept counsel's representation on the point. Second, many if not most of the aircraft involved in these 
387 sales were non-current when purchased from Cessna by the various Walston distributors, who in turn made them available 
to Walston Aviation, Inc. Even if these sales by the latter were to other dealers for purposes of resale the situation appears to 
have been atypical, resulting from the fact that when Cessna attempted to dispose of its remaining inventory of aircraft following 
the end of a model year, the Walston distributors customarily purchased the bulk of them. The evidence does not reflect that 
dealers other than Walston Aviation, Inc. ordinarily dealt to any extent in reselling non-current new aircraft to other dealers for 
resale, nor, as mentioned, that either White Industries or Carthage Airways did so."
1185,26," A customer sometimes had very particular requirements regarding the plane he wished to purchase. If the dealer he 
approached did not have a plane meeting those requirements, the dealer would call his distributor (or, if a zone dealer, 
presumably his Cessna zone). If the distributor (or zone) did not have the plane in stock, an effort would be made by the 
distributor (or zone) to find the plane elsewhere in the system and to acquire it by purchase or trade. Whether this same sort of 
thing also occurred with any consistency at the dealer level, as is common in the automobile sales business, see Cartrade, Inc. 
v. Ford Dealers, Etc., 446 F.2d 289, 290-93 (9th Cir. 1971), is unknown. In any event, an ""accommodation sale"" of this nature 
(involving a search for and acquisition of the only aircraft of a particular sort which can be located with reasonable ease), even if "
1186,," made between dealers, would not be the kind of transaction which demonstrates the existence of a general dealer-to-dealer for 
resale market."
1186,27," The statement is ordinarily made in addressing a slightly different problem, but I think it has application here, at least in spirit."
1186,28," A much better point for the argument could be made in connection with distributor sales to an independent dealer - or for that 
matter to any dealer, contracted, zone or independent - for use, although the result might not be very practical. The point is 
largely academic, however, since even in those instances where I am able to identify a distributor's purchaser as a dealer of 
some sort, or even simply as an FBO, the evidence usually does not provide so much as a hint concerning the principal reason 
for purchase. See text infra. "
1187,29," The mere fact that a given sale was a ""pass-thru"" or ""conduit"" sale by a distributor - i.e., a sale actually negotiated and 
consummated by the distributor, but with the chain of title reflecting a sale to a dealer and a resale by that dealer - does nothing 
to prove the point; the evidence reflects a number of such sales which were made to dealers (independent or otherwise), thus 
leaving the inquiry where it started."
1187,30," Trying to identify the nature of a purchase by virtue of the purchaser's name alone is generally a futile exercise, even though 
there was testimony that the presence of the word ""service"" in the name usually signified an FBO. And, of course, merely 
knowing that a purchaser was an FBO is of no help; not all FBOs bought all their planes for the immediate principal purpose of 
use. An exception has been made in a very limited number of instances, however, where the name and the accompanying 
evidence allow a reasonable inference that the purchaser was not involved in any aspect of aircraft sales. "
1188,31," The evidence does reflect that ""Aircraft Finance Company,"" a separately incorporated Walston company which functioned, on 
occasion, as a dealer, in fact had no operating facilities or employees of its own.  However, even if it is treated as a single entity 
with its parent on that basis, the ruling does not aid plaintiffs: the parent was Walston Aviation, Inc., another dealer, not a 
distributor. Nor do I believe the discussion in the text is altered by the fact that Walston Aviation, Inc. (the dealer) was actually 
the parent of the various Walston distributors. In applying the ""domination"" test, it should make no difference what the respective 
functional levels of the parent and subsidiary may be."
1188,32," I have not overlooked plaintiffs' citations to Alhambra Motor Parts, 57 F.T.C. 1007 (1960), aff'd in part, set aside in part, and 
remanded, 309 F.2d 213 (9th Cir. 1962), on remand, 68 F.T.C. 1039 (1965), and similar ""group buying"" cases. I do not consider 
those cases in point: they involve situations where the putative wholesaler was found to be, in substantial part, nothing more 
than a passive ""front"" for the group buyers, and in addition usually reflect a consistent partial pass-thru of the wholesaler's 
discount to those group buyers. Those are not the facts of this case. "
1189,33," I do not quarrel with the theory that a sufficient amount of price advertising could generate such standards; the evidence 
simply does not convince me that this occurred on the sort of continuing, generalized basis plaintiffs suggest. In fact, plaintiffs' 
own computer generated summaries reflect a wide variation in resale prices for the same model of aircraft. Admittedly, this could 
be based in part upon how those planes were equipped, but that further variable hardly helps prove plaintiffs' point. "
1190,34," One might argue that the area in which a distributor made aircraft sales of any kind should be the relevant standard. There is, 
however, an obvious potential difference between the geographic area in which a distributor, dealing with its own or with other 
dealers, might expect to market aircraft for resale, and the area involved when that distributor deals with at least some kinds of 
end consumers. Lacking any testimony on the subject, I am unwilling simply to assume that the two areas are co-extensive."
1190,35," Aviation Activities, Inc., of Valparaiso, Indiana; Southaire, Inc., of Memphis, Tennessee; and Florida Aircraft Distributors, Inc., 
of Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida. "
1193,36," Carthage Airways apparently made a similar, although more diversified mistake, purchasing and carrying a larger inventory of 
expensive aircraft than would make good business sense for a dealer of its size and location, see Love testimony; a point which 
Ingram himself appears to have accepted."
1193,37," I do not suggest that a seller must always have had actual communications with a buyer in order to show diverted sales. 
Presumably, in some circumstances a simple downturn in sales might suffice. However, that sort of evidence is lacking here. 
Without one sort of proof or the other, or some comparable approach, it is difficult to see how such diversions could be shown."
1193,38," Florida Airlines, for example, did not want their planes equipped with Cessna avionics or autopilot, and did not want dual 
instruments, twin doors, de-ice propellors, an auxiliary fuel system or an oxygen system.  Each of White Industries' 402A aircraft 
had Cessna avionics, de-ice propellors, auxiliary fuel system, oxygen system and twin doors. Some of these items on White

1221,1," Plaintiff argues, in the alternative, that defendant should be estopped from denying that plaintiff was a franchisee because 
plaintiff relied on defendant's alleged promises and repaired, refurnished, and repainted the Dennisport station at his own 
expense. HN6[
] The doctrine of promissory estoppel has been raised in some PMPA cases in determining whether an existing 
franchise was properly terminated or not renewed.  Rogue Valley Stations, Inc. v. Birk Oil Co., 568 F. Supp. 337, 350 (D. Ore. 
1983); Baldauf v. Amo'co Oil Company, 553 F. Supp. 408, 417 (W.D. Mich. 1981), aff d, 700 F.2d 326 (6th Cir. 1983); Wesley v.

However, this court finds the doctrine of promissory estoppel may not be invoked to establish the applicability of the PMPA."

Defendant agreed to this proposal on the condition that plaintiff accept a lower per gallon commission, which he did."
1222,4," This conclusion is not affected by plaintiff's claim that he had the option to buy gas prior to May 1, 1983. Thomas Aff. [P] 4(e). 
First, plaintiff's affidavit statement squarely conflicts with his deposition testimony. At his deposition, plaintiff stated that he had 
the option to buy gas after May 1, 1983. He did not testify that he had the option of buying gas before May 1. Second, and more 
important, plaintiff never exercised the option to buy gas before May 1, 1983. HN10[
] The fact that plaintiff allegedly had the 
option to purchase gas during the September to May period is immaterial to the conclusion that he was not a ""retailer"" based on 
his activities before May 1, 1983, for a retailer is defined as one who actually ""purchases motor fuel for sale to the general 
public."""

to be charged for all such beverages offered for sale within the state.  The prices shall be uniform for the same class trade 
buyers and shall set forth: (A) All brands and types of products offered for sale, (B) The delivered sale price for each size container to retail licensees, (C) Prices or maximum allowances or discounts to wholesale licensees, and (D) Any allowance granted for return containers. All price postings shall be consistent as between the various packages and containers offered for sale.  No price postings 
involving quantity discounts shall be made. (b) The Commission may reject any price posting which is in violation of any of its rules. . . . (c) Unless rejected by the Commission, prices shall be effective on the tenth day following receipt of the posting at the Portland 
office of the Commission. . . . (d) All postings reflecting a price decrease, when accepted, shall remain in effect for 180 days after the effective date of the 
posting. The Commission, at its discretion, may waive the 180-day period to allow for price increases based upon conditions 
which in its opinion warrant the increases. (2) Posting of wine prices: (a) Licensees of the Commission engaged in the business of soliciting sales of, selling or distributing wine for resale within the 
State of Oregon shall file with the Commission at its Portland office a written schedule in two copies of prices to be charged by 
such licensee for all wine offered for sale within the state.  The prices shall be uniform for the same class of trade buyers and 
shall set forth: (A) All brands, classes and kinds of wine offered for sale, and (B) The delivered sale price of each size container to retail licensees. Prices shall be the same for one container as for each like container in any quantity comprising a sale, order or delivery.  No 
allowance shall be made for return of containers and a wholesale licensee shall not purchase used containers from a retail 
licensee. (b) The Commission may reject any price posting which is in violation of any of its rules. . . . (c) Unless rejected by the Commission, prices shall be effective on the tenth day following receipt of the posting at the Portland 
office of the Commission. . . . (d) All postings reflecting a price decrease, when accepted, shall remain in effect for 30 days after the effective date of the 
posting. The Commission, at its discretion, may waive the 30-day period to allow for price increases based upon conditions

operating under a restaurant license, package store license, retail malt beverage license or dispenser license may transport, or 
have transported by the licensed retailer's employee or by a common carrier, from the licensed wholesaler premises to the

1264,7," Defendants argue the Oregon Court of Appeals' decision in Miller v. Oregon Liquor Control Commission, 42 Ore. App. 555, 600 
P.2d 954 (1979), determines the extent to which the challenged regulations serve interests under the Twenty-first Amendment. 
The state court's decision, however, determined only that the regulations were reasonably related to state statutory purposes, 
and therefore that there was a valid exercise of the administrative agency's authority.  The issues under the Twenty-first 
Amendment are quite different.  HN13[
] The court must examine both the federal interest and the state interest and resolve 
the conflict between them in accordance with what is at stake for each in reality in the concrete case -- the court must examine

1281,32," Defendants not only challenge the substantive import of Cohen's and Karr's statements, they also challenge the statements' 
admissibility. Id.  at 3-5. As a threshold matter, both statements are admissible against Williams as admissions and declarations against interest by an 
officer of a company.  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). The statements are also admissible against all the defendants generally, not for 
the truth of the matter asserted, but as evidence of the effort Cohen gave to persuade the other defendants. Fed. R.  Evid. 
801(c). The defendants, other than Williams, challenge the admissibility of the statements against them if they are offered for the truth of 
the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendants participated in a conspiracy. The general rule is that statements by an alleged "
1282,," conspirator may not be admitted into evidence against other alleged conspirators unless and until the proponent produces a ""fair 
preponderance"" of non-hearsay evidence establishing the other alleged conspirators participation. Neither party has brought any Second Circuit authority to the Court's attention with respect to whether this is the proper 
evidentiary standard under a motion for summary judgment. However, the Court does not reach this question because it finds 
that there is ample independent evidence to constitute the necessary preliminary showing of participation by the other alleged 
conspirators. This is especially true given a court's limited role in ruling on summary judgment: to search for issues in dispute, 
not weigh evidence, and to draw all inferences in favor of the nonmovant."
1282,33, D. Memo at 3.
1282,34," Id. at 9. Defendants rely heavily throughout their papers on Judge Ward's opinion denying TBA's petition for preliminary 
injunctive relief.  The standard for deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction is patently different, however, from the standard 
applied in deciding a motion for summary judgment. In order to be granted preliminary relief the moving party must show irreparable injury. It is also incumbent on the defendant to 
show either probable success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits and, a balance of hardships 
decidedly in its favor. See, e.g., Jack Kahn Music v. Baldwin Piano & Organ Co., 604 F.2d 755, 758 (2d Cir. 1979). In denying 
TBA's motion, Judge Ward found that TBA had not met this burden; however, this does not satisfy defendants' burden before the 
Court on the instant motion for summary judgment. In addition to a different standard, the court ruling on a motion for preliminary 
relief must examine the evidence and issues at a much earlier stage in the case's development.  Judge Ward ruled before any 
substantial discovery had proceeded; subsequently, substantial facts have been developed by TBA. See P. Memo at 58-60. As Professor Moore notes, ""findings [of a preliminary injunction motion] cannot be used to ground a motion for summary 
judgment when they resolve contested issues of fact."" 7 J. Moore, Federal Practice, para. 65.04[5], at 65-70 (1986) Preliminary 
injunction decisions rule on ""only the probability of success of the merits rather than the merits themselves."" Jones v. New York 
City Human Resources Admin., 391 F. Supp. 1064, 1068 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1975), aff'd, 528 F.2d 696 (2d Cir.), cert.  denied, 429 
U.S. 825, 50 L. Ed. 2d 88, 97 S. Ct. 80 (1976). In sum, the granting of summary judgment should not be premised on the "
1283,," determination of a preliminary injunction motion. See S.E.C. v. North American R & D Corp., 59 F.R.D. 111, 113 (S.D.N.Y. 
1972)."
1283,35, D. Memo at 15.
1283,36," For example, defendants introduced evidence at the hearing pursuant to TBA's motion for preliminary injunction that: Mr. Gordon, the President of defendant Gordon . . . wanted to protect the manner in which the listing information is 
presented. He found plaintiff's presentation ""sloppy"" and hard to understand. Id. at 19."
1283,37, Id. at 20.
1283,38," Id. This Court is sympathetic to defendants' free riding argument.  The Supreme Court has held that business firms have a 
right to protect their investments from free riders.  Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 493, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315, 94 S. 
Ct. 1879 (1974). Protection against free riding is clearly not anticompetitive. See Continental T.V. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 
36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). Defendants also properly point out that ""others are free, by expending comparable 
resources to develop sophisticated listing systems."" Defs.' Jt.  Reply at 7. As discussed more extensively in the body of the opinion, defendants' free rider argument fails to persuade the Court for two 
reasons. First, the Court's inference of conspiracy and joint activity among the defendants makes it less likely that the free rider 
problem was really uppermost in the minds of defendants' executives when they acted simultaneously to cut off TBA. Second, 
the Court accepts, to some extent, plaintiff's argument that TBA does more than free ride on defendants' information. TBA does 
not just ""sell or treat as proprietary what defendants provide for free. . . . TBA sells a service . . . that enables subscribers to 
locate information."" P. Memo at 44 (emphasis supplied). At this preliminary stage, based on the papers before it, the Court could 
very well find that TBA's formatting and retrieval services, as well as its own interstitial investigative efforts, generates 
information; and that TBA does not merely free ride on defendants. "

also deny the motion for summary judgment with respect to the Donnelly claim. This concession can be inferred from 
defendant's failure to advance any argument with respect to the merits of the Donnelly claim other than it should be dismissed 
for the same reasons presented in defendants' discussion of the Sherman Act claim. The only extensive discussion in defendant's papers regarding the Donnelly Act revolves around the law of pendent jurisdiction.

1302,3," B&H claims that service cannot be treated as being separable from a product market and therefore that the alleged 
arrangement is merely a dual distributorship. We disagree. It is evident that for certain products (automobiles are the most 
obvious example), the product market is not coextensive with the service market. The fact that Dimidowich, who is not a 
distributor, services other brands of micrographic equipment suggests that the markets are separate in the micrographic 
industry. B&H is entitled, however, to try to prove at trial that the markets are unified. B&H also claims, somewhat inconsistently, that the service market encompasses all brands of micrographic equipment and 
therefore that the alleged restraint does not hinder competition significantly in that market. Dimidowich's own varied business 
supports this claim to some extent. However, an owner of broken B&H micrographic equipment is indifferent to people who can 
service Kodak or 3M machines. If the owner's only option is to request service from B&H or Comgraphix (depending on his 
location), that is obviously the market the owner faces. B&H is entitled to prove that replacement parts for different brands of 
micrographic equipment are interchangeable and therefore that its policy has no anticompetitive effect. However, if that is the 
case, its replacement parts policy makes little sense. In any event, B&H is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that 
there is no evidence of anticompetitive effect."
1302,4," The two cases primarily relied upon by B&H, Calculators Hawaii, Inc. v. Brandt, Inc., 724 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1983) and Bushie 
v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116 (9th Cir. 1972), both involve restraints in the context of purely vertical arrangements: "
1303,," distributors complained that outlets of the manufacturer displaced them. Although in both cases, plaintiffs both sold and serviced 
the manufacturer's product, there was no evidence in either case that the manufacturer was dividing up the service market with 
one of its distributors, or refusing to sell parts pursuant to such a market division."
1303,5," The parties point to no cases analyzing dual distributorships under the rule of reason that have found restraints that were, on 
balance, anticompetitive. This absence of demonstrated anticompetitive effect supports our conclusion that a per se rule is 
inappropriate."
1303,6," We note that a ""hybrid"" arrangement only justifies the application of the rule of reason where the market in which the 
conspirators are in a vertical relationship is in some way interdependent with the market in which they have a horizontal 
relationship. The fact that Conglomerate A supplies Conglomerate B with bread to sell in B's retail stores almost certainly has 
nothing to do with A and B's ability to agree to sell steel at the same price. The latter is still horizontal price-fixing and illegal per 
se. Only when there is a possibility that the restraint in the market in which there is a horizontal relationship will have significant 
procompetitive effects in the other market, as is the case when the markets are for the service and the distribution of the same 
product, is rule of reason analysis appropriate. "
1304,7," B&H also alleges that it refused to deal because it would cost more to maintain a parts inventory sufficient to supply 
independent service organizations and because random parts orders could deplete inventories necessary for its own service 
operations. These reasons, however, do not explain why B&H would conspire with Comgraphix to refuse to deal. "
1305,8," We note that the harm alleged is to competition, not merely to a competitor. Cf.  Calculators Hawaii v. Brandt, Inc., 724 F.2d 
1332, 1337-38 (9th Cir. 1983). The California state agencies that selected Dimidowich's bid to service their B&H equipment over 
B&H's bid are not receiving the same service (with full access to replacement parts) that they would receive if the service market 
were fully competitive. "
1310,1," Plaintiff attacks this argument by claiming that the Supreme Court rejected the reasoning of Hoskins Coal in Wilson. This is not 
completely accurate. In Hoskins Coal, the characterization issue was determined as a matter of state law. In Wilson, the 
Supreme Court noted that ""the question whether antitrust claims were more analogous to penal claims or to claims arising in tort, 
contract, or on a statute, was treated as a matter of federal law by the better reasoned authority."" Wilson, 105 S. Ct. at 1944 
n.19. We agree that this aspect of Hoskins Coal was incorrect, and indeed we make our characterization today of a civil RICO 
claim as a matter of federal law. However, the proper source of law for making the characterization of civil antitrust claims does 
not detract whatsoever from the ultimate conclusion in Hoskins Coal that the proper characterization of a civil antitrust claim was 
as an action for treble damages. "
1311,1," Dissenting from denial of certiorari in Preuit & Mauldin v. Jones, 474 U.S. 1105, 106 S. Ct. 893, 895 n.3, 88 L. Ed. 2d 926 
(1986), Justice White similarly suggested that the Congress ought to extricate the courts from the same exercise with respect to 
limitations in section 1983 actions. See generally Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 105 S. Ct. 1938, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1985). "
1312,2," For a description of the Congress' consideration of the statute of limitation issue, see State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Estate 
of Caton, 540 F. Supp. 673, 684 (N.D. Ind. 1982)."
1312,3, See Maj. Op. at slip pp. 5-6.
1312,4," As the ABA Task Force Report noted: The law regarding the applicable statute of limitations for Civil RICO claims is confused, inconsistent, and unpredictable. 
The current approach is virtually guaranteed to incite complex and expensive litigation over what should be a straight-
forward matter. In addition to disputes over the proper characterization of the RICO claim, which indeed may vary 
depending on whether it is governed by federal or state law, the current approach raises the possibility of further conflicts 
over the appropriate choice of law in multistate factual situations. (footnotes omitted) Report of the Ad Hoc Civil RICO Task Force, 1985 A.B.A. Sec. Corp. Banking & Bus. L. Rep. 391-92 [hereafter cited as ABA

1312,5," For the same reasons, it would be inappropriate to implement the methodology of DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 172, 76 L. Ed. 2d 476, 103 S. Ct. 2281 (1983) and ""turn away from state law"" in favor of the four-year 
statute of limitations in the Clayton Act. ""State law remains the norm for borrowing limitations periods,"" id. at 171, and the 
substantial differences in the purposes of the two statutes and in the conduct they proscribe hardly justifies deviation from the 
norm. Indeed, since Congress consciously incorporated some features of the Clayton Act in enacting RICO but failed to use the 
same statute of limitations, this court should be particularly hesitant to take that step. See ABA Task Force Report at 392. But 
see A.J. Cunningham Packing Corp. v. Congress Financial Corp., 792 F.2d 330, 337-41 (3d Cir. 1986) (Sloviter, J., concurring). "

""Congress was well aware that it was entering a new domain of federal involvement through the enactment of this measure."" 
Indeed, in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985), the Supreme Court 
emphasized the need for ""continuity plus relationship,"" in establishing a ""pattern of racketeering activity."" Id. at 3285 n.14. Of 
course, once the ""pattern"" is established, the plaintiff may recover for ""the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to 
constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an 
enterprise."" Id. at 3286."
1313,7," Durante Bros. & Sons, Inc. v. Flushing Nat'l Bank, 755 F.2d 239 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 906, 105 S. Ct. 3530, 87 L. 
Ed. 2d 654 (1985), was cited by the Third Circuit in Malley-Duff & Assoc., Inc. v. Crown Life Ins. Co., 792 F.2d 341, 347-48 (3d 
Cir. 1986), as authority for the proposition that a single statute of limitations should govern all civil RICO actions.  Malley-Duff, 
792 F.2d at 347-48 (N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. 214(2) (McKinney Supp. 1983-1984)) (governing actions to enforce a liability created 
by statute). However, in Bankers Trust v. Feldesman, 65 Bankr. 470, No. 82 Civ. 5590 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 1986), the court held 
that Durante could not be read as establishing such a general rule. Nonetheless, the district court in Bankers Trust did adopt 
such a rule."

not required to prove a relevant market to show attempted monopolization under § 2 when defendant engaged in per se

Blanton court made clear, the Ninth Circuit waives the requirement of proving a relevant market only in cases involving 
attempted monopolization rather than actual monopolization and in which the plaintiff shows either predatory conduct or a per se 
violation of § 1.  Blanton, 721 F.2d at 1214. We follow the rule established in this and most of our sister circuits, that proof of a 
relevant market is always required."
1329,10, Complaint at para. 30(c). 
1330,11," Consul cites numerous other cases in its attempt to allay the problem of market definition. None is persuasive. Consul finds 
the beginnings of ""essential facility"" theory in United States v. Terminal Railroad Association, 224 U.S. 383, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 S. 
Ct. 507 (1912), which, as Consul notes, predates the recognition of market definition as the indispensable element in Sherman 
Act analysis in United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1955). 
Nevertheless, Terminal Railroad evinces considerable concern for the particular effects of that defendant's actions on a 
particular market for rail transportation: St. Louis. See 224 U.S. at 392-407; see generally Troy, Unclogging the Bottleneck: A 
New Essential Facility Doctrine, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 441 (1983) (arguing that essential facility cases fit, at the threshold, within 
traditional § 2 analysis, including market definition). This is the type of concern not presented by Consul's evidence, which 
cannot and does not establish the degree to which Transco has market power over natural gas at the wellhead. Eastman Kodak 
Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 71 L. Ed. 684, 47 S. Ct. 400 (1927), to which we are also referred, is wholly 
inapposite: in that case the question of monopolization had been settled in a prior and separate suit. See id. at 369. As for ""leverage"" theory, Consul itself acknowledges the need to prove monopolization in one market before examining the 
""leveraging"" of that monopoly power in the separate market. In the case of United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 
173, 89 L. Ed. 160, 65 S. Ct. 254 (1944), cited by Consul, the relevant geographical market was clearly established: seventy-odd 
small towns in the mid-east. Similarly, in United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948), the 
monopolistic practices involved corporations in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico that owned the only movie theater in each of 
fifty-three towns. Nor do the ""market foreclosure"" cases to which Consul refers us offer a way around the requirement of market definition. The 
Court in Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953), struggled with the 
proper extent of the market for newspapers. See id. at 610 (""Once granted that the volume of commerce affected was not 
'insignificant or insubstantial,' the Times-Picayune's market position becomes critical to the case."") (citation omitted). Likewise in 
Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 96 L. Ed. 162, 72 S. Ct. 181 (1951), the Court examined the particular details 
of commerce in communication in and out of Lorain, Ohio, concluding that the Journal had ""a substantial monopoly in its area.""

1330,12," See Standard Oil Co. (California) v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 299 n.5, 93 L. Ed. 1371, 69 S. Ct. 1051 (1949)."
1330,13," See, e.g., II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application para. 517 (1978); 
R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 195-201 (2d ed. 1972). "
1331,14," The Fifth Circuit has held that a natural gas field constituted a relevant geographic market under § 2 of the Sherman Act. See 
Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 
1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972). Both parties in that case were owner/extractors of the gas field; their competition 
was tied to that field. In contrast, Transco can operate anywhere along the pipeline, and Consul is in the business of finding 
natural gas wherever it exists. Nothing inherent in the market, as Consul presented that market to us, links their competition to 
any one or two particular fields."
1331,15," Cf. Pierce, supra note 5, at 381 (discussing Transco's power in the market for transportation of natural gas into North 
Carolina). This case in no way forecloses a showing that a natural monopolist has violated the Sherman Act in a way analogous 
to Otter Tail. The plaintiff here, by focusing on the localized production source in Mississippi, has not presented us with the facts 
about the relevant market necessary for such a showing."
1331,16," Consul raises several points on appeal in connection with the granting of summary judgment, which points are mooted by the 
failure to prove a relevant market. We therefore decline to discuss the adequacy of hearing afforded to Consul on its charge of 
regulatory obstruction, or the sufficiency of the evidence that Consul presented. All of the contested evidence, if admitted, would 
not establish an antitrust violation under Sherman Act § 2, absent a clearer showing of Transco's monopoly power in a relevant 
market. "
1340,1," The allegations in plaintiffs' complaint are set forth in a previous Opinion and Order of the Court dated May 13, 1984. See 
Johnson v. Soundview Apts. Housing Development Fund, 585 F. Supp. 559, 559-60."
1340,2," The Court's oral Order was subsequently set forth in a written Order of the Court dated August 2, 1982."
1340,3," In Yentsch v. Texaco, 630 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit noted that there are five specific elements to an illegal 
tying arrangement: (1) a tying and a tied product; (2) evidence of actual coercion by the seller forcing the buyer to accept the tied 
product; (3) sufficient economic power in the tying product market to coerce the purchaser to accept the tied product; (4) 
anticompetitive effects in the tied market; and (5) involvement of a ""not insubstantial"" amount of interstate commerce in the tied 
product market. See id. at 56-57."
1340,4," The Court concluded that the complaint adequately alleges that the defendants' have market power in the tying product market 
because the complaint alleges that the defendants ""are able, by virtue of federal subsidies, to offer shelter at rates far below the 
market rate, in a geographic area in which apartment vacancies are very scarce . . ., and all other subsidized housing 
developments have lengthy waiting lists."" See Complaint at para. 52; see also Stipulation of Facts at paras. 37-43. "
1341,," Moreover, assuming arguendo that the tying product market should be more narrowly defined, i.e., the market for low-cost 
subsidized housing in Southern Westchester County, New York, the Court is even more convinced that the defendants have 
sufficient economic power in the tying market in that the scarcity of low cost subsidized housing causes the demand for this 
product to far exceed its supply. See Stipulation of Facts at paras. 37-43."
1341,5," The Court made this request because the Court, in denying defendants' initial motion, had relied at least in part upon the fact 
that the defendants were not compelled by federal law to implement the mandatory meal plan, a circumstance that these cases 
held was not dispositive with respect to immunity pursuant to state regulation. Compare Southern Motor Carriers, supra, 471 
U.S. at 59. "
1342,6," The only specific Congressional directive which the defendants have cited in support of their immunity claim is 42 U.S.C. § 
8004 which provides in part: (h) Each non profit and public housing agency shall establish fees for meal service and other appropriate services provided 
to eligible project residences. These fees shall be reasonable . . . . When meal services are provided to other project 
residents, fees shall be reasonable and may not exceed the cost of providing the meal service. (i) The Secretary shall establish standards for the provision of services under this chapter . . . . See Def. Mem. at 24-25 (emphasis added). As defendants' concede, this statutory section does not even relate to the type of low income housing program at issue in this 
case. See Tr. at 36-37. Therefore, the only conceivable relevancy of the cited statute is the emphasized sentence which relates 
to ""other project residents."" Nothing in that sentence, however, even remotely seeks to regulate or authorize mandatory meal 
plans. "
1352,1," The district court may have interpreted our cases to require that it reach its decision solely by determining whether McTravel's 
probability of success balanced against the harm it would suffer if the court denied the injunction exceeded American's 
probability of success balanced against the harm that it would suffer were the injunction granted. While a district court has "
1353,," discretion to consider these factors as part of its effort to weigh the equities, it is not required to do so. This circuit continues to 
adhere to the traditional equitable doctrines governing preliminary injunctions. We have not adopted ""a new legal standard . . . 
intended . . . to force analysis into a quantitative straight jacket,"" American Hospital Supply, 780 F.2d at 593. "
1357,1," 1. Do you find that plaintiffs have proven the futility of trying to obtain quality first-run films in open bidding? Yes    No (a) If ""yes"" as of what date:"
1357,2," . Do you find that plaintiffs have proven that the Norwich Cinema, as presented in the evidence, was comparable to the Liberty 
Theatre for the period 1978 - 1981? Yes    No"

1358,2," Twice the jury was instructed that, if they believed compensatory damages were unwarranted either because no damages were 
suffered or because they were not proven, they could still award nominal damages and indicate as such by placing the word 
""nominal"" in parenthesis. Tr. at 177 (June 17, 1986); Tr. at 6 (June 18, 1986)."
1358,3," Plaintiffs initially argue that defendants should not now be allowed to complain about the jury's award since defendants made 
no objection to the award at trial. The issue of waiver under Rule 49(a) has not been uniformly decided. Compare Malley-Duff & 
Associates v. Crown Life Ins. Co., 734 F.2d 133, 144-45 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1072, 83 L. Ed. 2d 505, 105 S. Ct. 564 
(1984) (no waiver); Mercer v. Long Mfg. N.C., Inc., 671 F.2d 946, 947 (5th Cir. 1982) (no waiver); Alverez v. J. Ray McDermott & 
Co., 674 F.2d 1037, 1040 (5th Cir. 1982) (no waiver), with Itel Capital Corp. v. Cups Coal Co., 707 F.2d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir. 
1983) (waiver); Skillin v. Kimball, 643 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir. 1981) (waiver). The transcript in this case is clear. Both parties were 
provided with ample opportunity to suggest that the jury be charged further before the verdict was accepted. Tr. at 10-18 (June 
18, 1986). Neither party chose to do so.  Now, the court must deal with a situation which might otherwise have been avoided by 
further consideration by the jury. While the the efficacy of a rule which allows a party to waive a request for further jury 
deliberation at trial for strategic reasons and then turn around after the jury has been discharged and appeal to the court to 
interpret the jury's verdict is dubious, Malley-Duff renders plaintiffs' argument of waiver meritless. See also Schaafsma v. Morin 
Vermont Corp., 802 F.2d 629, 634 (2d Cir. 1986) (Rule 49(b) puts onus on trial judge to resolve inconsistencies before jury is 
discharged even if no objection is made)."
1358,4," The same burden is placed on appellate courts. In fairness to trial courts and in order to preserve parties' Seventh Amendment rights, appellate courts ""struggle"" to find a 
way of reconciling seemingly inconsistent interrogatory answers and verdicts: ""'Where there is a view of the case that 
makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.'"" Schaafsma, 802 F.2d at 635, citing Julien J. Studley, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 407 F.2d 521, 526-27 (2d Cir. 1969), quoting Atlantic, 
369 U.S. at 364. "
1359,5," HN3[
] The court is obligated to take such measures in order to insure that the principles of the seventh amendment are observed.  Schaafsma, 802 F.2d at 635; Gonzales v. Missouri Pacific RR, 511 F.2d 629 (5th Cir. 1975)."
1359,6," Plaintiff's state court citations do not overcome the persuasive ruling of the First, Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have 
considered this issue in the antitrust area and limited nominal damages to $1.00. "
1360,7," Plaintiff's supplemental citation to Fox West Coast Theatres v. Paradise Theatre, 264 F.2d 602 (9th Cir. 1958), is not 
inconsistent with this holding. There, reference to the $20,000 award as nominal was not made in the legal sense, but in the 
sense that the award was nominal or small in comparison to the substantially larger award that might have been rendered on the 
evidence."
1360,8," In view of the Supreme Court's ruling in Carey and the weight of authority favoring nominal damages, it is unlikely that the 
Second Circuit would follow its dicta in Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 297 F.2d 906, 909 n. 4 (2d Cir. 
1962), and deny nominal damages in antitrust cases. In any event, that case did not consider a limit on nominal damages. "
1362,9, The issue of prejudgment interest shall be determined with plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees.
