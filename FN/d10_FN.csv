6,2," In its opinion the Commission found that the services 
provided by Brown in its franchise program were the ""prime 
motivation"" for dealers to join and remain in the program; that 
the program resulted in franchised stores purchasing 75% of 
their total shoe requirements from Brown -- the remainder 
being for the most part shoes which were not ""conflicting"" 
lines, as provided by the agreement; that the effect of the plan 
was to foreclose retail outlets to Brown's competitors, 
particularly small manufacturers; and that enforcement of the 
plan was effected by teams of field men who called upon the 
shoe stores, urged the elimination of other manufacturers' 
conflicting lines and reported deviations to Brown who then 
cancelled under a provision of the agreement.  Compare 
Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294."
