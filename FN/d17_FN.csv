11,1," In a competitive market, indirect network effects also 
encourage companies to take increased profits from a price 
increase on side A and spend them on side B to ensure more 
robust participation on that side and to stem the impact of 
indirect network effects. See Evans & Schmalensee 688; 
Evans & Noel 670-671, 695. Indirect network effects thus limit 
the platform’s ability to raise overall prices and impose a check 
on its market power. See Evans & Schmalensee 688; Evans & 
Noel 695."
12,2," “Cardholders are more price-sensitive because many 
consumers have multiple payment methods, including 
alternative payment cards. Most merchants, by contrast, 
cannot accept just one major card because they are likely to 
lose profitable incremental sales if they do not take [all] the 
major payment cards. Because most consumers do not carry 
all of the major payment cards, refusing to accept a major card 
may cost the merchant substantial sales.” Muris 522."
12,3, All figures are accurate as of 2013.
12,4," Discover entered the credit-card market several years after 
Amex, Visa, and MasterCard. It nonetheless managed to gain 
a foothold because Sears marketed Discover to its already 
significant base of private-label cardholders. Discover’s 
business model shares certain features with Amex, Visa, and 
MasterCard. Like Amex, Discover interacts directly with its 
cardholders. But like Visa and MasterCard, Discover uses 
banks that cooperate with its network to interact with 
merchants."
13,5," Plaintiffs also sued Visa and MasterCard, claiming that their 
anti-steering provisions violated §1. But Visa and MasterCard 
voluntarily revoked their antisteering provisions and are no 
longer parties to this case."
14,6," Although the plaintiffs relied on indirect evidence below, they 
have abandoned that argument in this Court. See Brief for 
United States 23, n. 4 (citing Pet. for Cert. i, 18-25)."
14,7," The plaintiffs argue that we need not define the relevant 
market in this case because they have offered actual evidence 
of adverse effects on competition—namely, increased 
merchant fees. See Brief for United States 40-41 (citing FTC 
v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 
2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), and Catalano, Inc. v. Target 
Sales, Inc., 446 U. S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 
(1980) (per curiam)). We disagree. The cases that the 
plaintiffs cite for this proposition evaluated whether horizontal 
restraints had an adverse effect on competition. See Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, supra, at 450-451, 459, 106 S. Ct. 
2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (agreement between competing 
dentists not to share X rays with insurance companies); 
Catalano, supra, at 644-645, 650, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 
2d 580 (agreement among competing wholesalers not to 
compete on extending credit to retailers). Given that horizontal 
restraints involve agreements between competitors not to 
compete in some way, this Court concluded that it did not 
need to precisely define the relevant market to conclude that 
these 
agreements 
were 
anticompetitive. 
See 
Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 460-461, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 
L. Ed. 2d 445; Catalano, supra, at 648-649, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 
64 L. Ed. 2d 580. But vertical restraints are different. See 
Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 348, 
n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); Leegin 
Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 
888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). HN7[

 LEdHN[7][
] [7] Vertical restraints often pose no risk to 
competition unless the entity imposing them has market 
power, which cannot be evaluated unless the Court first 
defines the relevant market. See id., at 898, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 
168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (noting that a vertical restraint “may not be a 
serious concern unless the relevant entity has market power”);

"
15,8," Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, post, at ___ - ___, 201 L. 
Ed. 2d, at 703, merchant services and cardholder services are 
not complements. See Filistrucchi 297 (“[A] two-sided market 
[is] different from markets for complementary products, in 
which both products are bought by the same buyers, who, in 
their buying decisions, can therefore be expected to take into 
account 
both 
prices”). 
As 
already 
explained,HN10[
] LEdHN[10][
] 
[10] 
credit-card 
companies 
are 
best 
understood as supplying only one product—transactions—
which is jointly consumed by a cardholder and a merchant. 
See Klein 580. Merchant services and cardholder services are 
both inputs to this single product. See ibid.
"
15,53," Antitrust L. J. 135, 160 (1984) (“[T]he possibly 
anticompetitive manifestations of vertical arrangements can 
occur only if there is market power”)."
16,9," Nontransaction platforms, by contrast, often do compete with 
companies that do not operate on both sides of their platform. 
A newspaper that sells advertising, for example, might have to 
compete with a television network, even though the two do not 
meaningfully compete for viewers. See Filistrucchi 301."
18,10," The plaintiffs argue that United States v. Topco Associates, 
Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 
(1972), forbids any restraint that would restrict competition in 
part of the market—here, for example, merchant steering. See 
Brief for Petitioners and Respondents Nebraska, Tennessee, 
and Texas 30, 42. Topco does not stand for such a broad 
proposition. Topco concluded that a horizontal agreement 
between competitors was unreasonable per se, even though 
the agreement did not extend to every competitor in the 
market. See 405 U. S., at 599, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 
2d 515. A horizontal agreement between competitors is 
markedly different from a vertical agreement that incidentally 
affects one particular method of competition. See Leegin, 551 
U. S., at 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623; Maricopa 
County Medical Soc., 457 U. S., at 348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 
2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48."
