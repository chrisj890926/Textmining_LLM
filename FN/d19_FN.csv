otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared 
to be illegal."" Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended in

any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may 
be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a 
monopoly.""

14,3," In addition, there is a certain amount of bank holding 
company activity.  The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 
U. S. C. §§ 1841-1848, brought bank holding companies 
under stringent federal regulation.  As of 1958, the 43 
registered bank holding companies controlled 5.7% of all 
banking offices and 7.4% of all deposits. Lent, The Changing 
Structure of Commercial Banking (1960), 19.  See also 
Comment, supra, note 2,  71 Yale L. J., at 516-522."

14,5," The principal banking ""products"" are of course various types 
of credit, for example: unsecured personal and business

goods installment loans, tuition financing, bank credit cards, 
revolving credit funds.  Banking services include: acceptance 
of

from 
individuals, 
corporations, 
governmental agencies, and other banks; acceptance of time 
and savings deposits; estate and trust planning and 
trusteeship services; lock boxes and safety-deposit boxes; 
account reconciliation services; foreign department services 
(acceptances and letters of credit); correspondent services;"
15,," investment advice.  It should be noted that many other 
institutions are in the business of supplying credit, and so 
more or less in competition with commercial banks (see 
further, pp. 356-357, infra), for example: mutual savings 
banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, personal-
finance 
companies, 
sales-finance 
companies, 
private 
businessmen (through the furnishing of trade credit), factors, 
direct-lending government agencies, the Post Office, Small 
Business Investment Corporations, life insurance companies.
"
16,6," In 1957, for example, there were three bank suspensions in 
the entire country by reason of financial difficulties; in 1960, 
two; and in 1961, nine.  Of these nine, four involved state 
banks which were neither members of the FRS nor insured by 
the FDIC.  1961 Annual Report of the Comptroller of the 
Currency 286.  In a typical year in the 1920's, roughly 600 
banks failed throughout the country, about 100 of them 
national banks.  See S. Rep. No. 196, Regulation of Bank 
Mergers, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 17-18."
16,7," The proposed ""merger"" of appellees is technically a"
17,," consolidation, since the resulting bank will be a different entity 
from either of the constituent banks, whereas if the transaction 
were a merger, Girard would disappear into PNB and PNB 
would survive.  However, the proposed transaction resembles 
a merger very closely, in that PNB's shareholders are not to 
surrender their present share certificates and the resulting 
bank is to operate under PNB's charter.  In any event, the 
statute treats mergers and consolidations essentially alike, 
compare 12 U. S. C. (1958 ed., Supp. IV) § 215 with § 215a, 
and it is not suggested that the legal question of the instant 
case would be affected by whether the transaction is 
technically a merger or a consolidation. Therefore, throughout 
this opinion we use the term ""merger.""
"
17,8," Section 1828 (c) provides in pertinent part: HN3[
] ""No insured [by FDIC] bank shall merge or 
consolidate with any other insured bank or, either directly or 
indirectly, acquire the assets of, or assume liability to pay any 
deposits made in, any other insured bank without the prior 
written consent (i) of the Comptroller of the Currency if the 
acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a national bank 
or a District [of Columbia] bank, or (ii) of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System if the acquiring, 
assuming, or resulting bank is to be a State member bank 
(except a District bank), or (iii) of the [Federal Deposit 
Insurance] Corporation if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting 
bank is to be a nonmember insured bank (except a District 
bank). . . .  In granting or withholding consent under this 
subsection, the Comptroller, the Board, or the Corporation, as 
the case may be, shall consider the financial history and 
condition of each of the banks involved, the adequacy of its 
capital structure, its future earnings prospects, the general 
character of its management, the convenience and needs of 
the community to be served, and whether or not its corporate 
powers are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  In the 
case of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or 
assumption of liabilities, the appropriate agency shall also take 
into consideration the effect of the transaction on competition 
(including any tendency toward monopoly), and shall not 
approve the transaction unless, after considering all of such 
factors, it finds the transaction to be in the public interest. In 
the interests of uniform standards, before acting on a merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of liabilities 
under this subsection, the agency (unless it finds that it must 
act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of one 
of the banks involved) shall request a report on the 
competitive factors involved from the Attorney General and the 
other two banking agencies referred to in this subsection . . . .  
The Comptroller, the Board, and the Corporation shall each 
"
17,," include in its annual report to the Congress a description of 
each merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or 
assumption of liabilities approved by it during the period 
covered by the report, along with the following information: . . . 
a statement by the Comptroller, the Board, or the Corporation, 
as the case may be, of the basis for its approval.""
"
18,11," We reject the argument that § 11 of the Clayton Act, as 
amended, 15 U. S. C. § 21, confers jurisdiction over banks 
upon the FTC.  That section provides in pertinent part: 
""Authority to enforce compliance with sections 13, 14, 18, and 
19 of this title [§§ 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act, as 
amended] by the persons respectively subject thereto is 
vested . . . in the Federal Reserve Board where applicable to 
banks, banking associations, and trust companies; and in the 
Federal Trade Commission where applicable to all other 
character of commerce . . . ."" The argument is that since the 
FRB has no authority to enforce the Clayton Act against bank 
mergers, see note 22, infra, bank mergers must fall into the 
residual category of ""all other character of commerce"" and so 
be subject to the FTC.  However, there is no intimation in the 
legislative history of the 1950 amendment to §§ 7 and 11 that 
the FTC's traditional lack of jurisdiction over banks was to be 
disturbed.  Moreover, it is clear from the language of § 11 that 
""banks, banking associations, and trust companies"" are meant 
to comprise a distinct ""character of commerce,"" and so cannot 
be part of the ""other character of commerce"" reserved to the 
FTC. The exclusion of banks from the FTC's jurisdiction appears to 
have been motivated by the fact that banks were already 
subject to extensive federal administrative controls.  See  T. C. 
Hurst & Son v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 268 F. 874, 877 (D. C. 
E. D. Va. 1920).
"
18,12," No argument is made in this case that banking is not 
commerce, and therefore that § 7 is inapplicable; plainly, such 
an argument would have no merit.  See Transamerica Corp. v.  
Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. Sys., 206 F.2d 163, 166 (C. A. 3d 
Cir. 1953); cf.   United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters 
Assn., 322 U.S. 533."
18,13," ""A merger necessarily involves the complete disappearance"
18,9," See 12 U. S. C. § 84, p. 329, supra.  The resulting bank 
would have a lending limit of $ 15,000,000, of which $ 
1,000,000 would not be attributable to the merger but to 
unrelated accounting factors."
18,10," There was evidence that Philadelphia, although it ranks 
fourth or fifth among the Nation's urban areas in terms of 
general commercial activity, ranks only ninth in terms of the 
size of its largest bank, and that some large business firms 
which have their head offices in Philadelphia must seek 
elsewhere to satisfy their banking needs because of the 
inadequate lending limits of Philadelphia's banks; First 
Pennsylvania and PNB, currently the two largest banks in 
Philadelphia, each have a lending limit of $ 8,000,000.  
Girard's is $ 6,000,000. Appellees offered testimony that the merger would enable 
certain economies of scale, specifically, that it would enable 
the formation of a more elaborate foreign department than 
either bank is presently able to maintain.  But this attempted 
justification, which was not mentioned by the District Court in 
its opinion and has not been developed with any fullness 
before this Court, we consider abandoned.
"
19,," of one of the merging corporations.  A sale of assets, on the 
other hand, may involve no more than a substitution of cash 
for some part of the selling company's properties, with no 
change in corporate structure and no change in stockholder 
interests.  Shareholders of merging corporations surrender 
their interests in those corporations in exchange for their very 
different rights in the resulting corporation.  In an asset 
acquisition, 
however, 
the 
shareholders 
of 
the 
selling 
corporation obtain no interest in the purchasing corporation 
and retain no interest in the assets transferred.  In a merger, 
unlike an asset acquisition, the resulting firm automatically 
acquires all the rights, powers, franchises, liabilities, and 
fiduciary rights and obligations of the merging firms.  In a 
merger, but not in an asset acquisition, there is the likelihood 
of a continuity of management and other personnel.  Finally, a 
merger, like a stock acquisition, necessarily involves the 
acquisition by one corporation of an immediate voice in the 
management of the business of another corporation; no voice 
in the decisions of another corporation is acquired by 
purchase of some part of its assets."" Brief for the United 
States, 75-76.
"
19,14," ""[A] merger such as appellees' may be effected upon the 
affirmative vote of the holders of only two-thirds of the 
outstanding stock of each bank . . . but if PNB were acquiring 
all of the Girard stock each Girard shareholder could decide 
for himself whether to transfer his shares.  A merger requires 
public notice whereas stock can be acquired privately.  A 
shareholder dissenting from a merger has the right to receive 
the appraised value of his shares . . . whereas no shareholder 
has a comparable right in an acquisition of stock. Furthermore 
the corporate existence of a merged company is terminated by 
a merger, but remains unaffected by an acquisition of stock.""

Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294, 313-314, and notes 
22-24."
19,16," In the case of an acquisition like the instant one, in which 
shares in the acquired corporation are to be exchanged for 
shares in the resulting corporation, a fortiori we discern no 
difficulty in conceptualizing the transaction as a ""stock 
acquisition."" Compare note 13, supra."
20,17," Statements to the same effect may be found in, e. g., Brown 
Shoe Co., supra, at 313-314, 316;  United States v. E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 592;  United States v. 
Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 507, n. 7;  United States v. 
Columbia Pictures Corp., 189 F.Supp. 153, 182 (D. C. S. D. N. 
Y. 1960). See also  33 Op. Atty. Gen. 225, 241 (1922); 
Hernacki, Mergerism and Section 7 of the Clayton Act,  20 
Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 659, 676-677 (1952); Wemple and Cutler, 
The Federal Bank Merger Law and the Antitrust Laws,  16 
Bus. Law. 994, 999-1000 (1961); Note, Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act: A Legislative History,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 768-
769 (1952). Actually, the holdings in the three cases that reached this 
Court, Thatcher, Swift, and Arrow-Hart, were quite narrow.  
See generally Note,  26 Col. L. Rev. 594-596 (1926). They 
were based not on a lack of substantive power under § 7, but 
on the enforcement section, § 11, which limited the FTC's 
remedial powers to ""an order requiring such person to cease 
and desist from such violations [of §§ 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the 
Clayton Act], and divest itself of the stock held or rid itself of 
the directors chosen contrary to the provisions of sections 
seven and eight of this Act."" 38 Stat. 735.  Faced with 
Congress' evident refusal to confer upon the FTC the ordinary 
powers of a court of equity, this Court held that unless the 
assets were acquired after the FTC's order of stock divestiture 
had been issued (which was the case in  Federal Trade 
Comm'n v. Western Meat Co., supra, where the Commission 
was sustained), the Commission could not order a divestiture 
of assets.  Compare Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. Sys. v.  
Transamerica Corp., 184 F.2d 311 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1950), with  
Federal Trade Comm'n v. International Paper Co., 241 F.2d 
372 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1956). Since under this Court's decisions 
the FTC was powerless even where the transfer of assets was 
an evasive maneuver aimed at defeating the FTC's remedial 
jurisdiction over stock acquisitions violative of § 7, a fortiori the 
Commission was powerless against the typical merger. See 
Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Elec. Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 
supra, at 595, 598-599. As part of the 1950 amendments to 
the Clayton Act, § 11 was amended to read: ""an order 
requiring such person to . . . divest itself of the stock, or other 
share capital, or assets, held . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 21. Whether 
as an original matter Thatcher, Swift and Arrow-Hart were 
correctly decided is no longer an open question, since they 
were the explicit premise of the 1950 amendment to § 7.  See 
State Bd. of Ins. v.  Todd Shipyards Corp., 370 U.S. 451, 
458, p. 349, infra.
 The question of the FTC's remedial powers under § 11 of the 
Clayton Act is to be distinguished from that of its remedial 
powers under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. 
S. C. § 45 (b).  In  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Eastman Kodak 
Co., 274 U.S. 619, the Court, relying on Thatcher and Swift, 
held that the Commission had no power to order divestiture in 
"
20,," § 5 proceedings.  But cf. Gilbertville Trucking Co. v.  United 
States, 371 U.S. 115, 129-131;  Pan American World Airways 
v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 312, and n. 17.
"
20,18," See note 1, supra, for text of amended § 7.  The original § 7 
read in pertinent part: ""no corporation engaged in commerce 
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the 
stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged 
also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be 
to substantially lessen competition between the corporation 
whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the 
acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or 
community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of 
commerce."" The passage of the 1950 amendment followed many years of 
unsuccessful attempts to enact legislation plugging the assets-
acquisition loophole. See Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766-767, 
notes 3 and 4 (1952).  To be sure, the 1950 amendment was 
intended not only to enlarge the number of transactions 
covered by § 7 but also to change the test of illegality.  The 
legislative history pertinent to the latter point is reviewed in 
Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 315-323, and is not directly 
relevant to the present discussion.
"
20,19," ""The purpose of the proposed legislation [the 1950"
21,," amendments to § 7] is to prevent corporations from acquiring 
another corporation by means of the acquisition of its assets, 
whereunder [sic] the present law it is prohibited from acquiring 
the stock of said corporation.  Since the acquisition of stock is 
significant chiefly because it is likely to result in control of the 
underlying assets, failure to prohibit direct purchase of the 
same assets has been inconsistent and paradoxical as to the 
over-all effect of existing law."" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 
2d Sess. 2.  This theme pervaded congressional consideration 
of the proposed amendments.  See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 
1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., passim; Hearing before 
Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary 
on Amending Sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, 81st

"
21,20," Columbia Steel involved the cash purchase by United States 
Steel Corporation of the physical assets of Consolidated Steel 
Corporation; there was no exchange of shares and no 
alteration of Consolidated's corporate identity.  See Transcript 
of Record,  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495 
(No. 461, October Term, 1947), pp. 453-475.  As a result of 
the purchase, in its horizontal aspect, U.S. Steel controlled 
about 24% of the structural steel fabricating market in an 11-
state western area.  This Court held that the acquisition could 
not be reached under § 7 of the  Clayton Act, see 334 U.S., at 
507, n. 7, and did not violate the Sherman Act. It should be 
noted, however, that the Court regarded the 24% market-
share figure proposed by the Government as a ""doubtful 
assumption"" and also pointed to ""unusual conditions"" tending 
to mitigate the anticompetitive effect of the acquisition.  334 
U.S., at 529. Columbia Steel was repeatedly cited by 
Congressmen considering the amendment of § 7 as an 
example of what they conceived to be the inability of the 
Sherman Act, as then construed, to deal with the problems of 
corporate concentration. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st 
Cong., 1st Sess. 10-11, and n. 16; Hearing before 
Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary 
on Amending Sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, 81st 
Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 10, pp. 28, 73; Hearings before a 
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on 
Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions, 81st Cong., 1st and 2d 
Sess. 24; 96 Cong. Rec. 16453 (Senator Kefauver, Senate 
sponsor of the bill to amend § 7: ""the Columbia Steel Co. case 
is a vivid illustration of the necessity for the proposed"
21,," amendment of the Clayton Act""), 16503; and cf. 96 Cong. Rec. 
16498-16499.
"
21,21," See note 19, supra.  The congressional attitude toward this 
Court's Thatcher, Swift, and Arrow-Hart decisions is typified in 
this remark of Senator O'Conor's: ""The Court, in effect, said 
that the [Federal Trade] Commission was quite free to use the 
power which Congress had conferred upon it, so long as it 
confined the use of that power to ordering the divestiture of 
pieces of paper which happened to be worthless."" 96 Cong. 
Rec. 16433.  Senator O'Mahoney remarked, for example, that 
there was ""no doubt of the fundamental fact that an innocent 
defect in the drafting of section 7 of the Clayton Act back in 
1914 had resulted in creating a great opportunity for escape 
by flagrant violators of the law."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16443.  After 
sharply criticizing this Court's decisions, the Senator 
continued: ""I take it the record is perfectly clear that what this 
bill purports to do is to correct an omission in the original 
Clayton Act. When the authors of the Clayton Act and the 
Congress which passed it enacted the bill into law they 
thought they were giving the Federal Trade Commission 
administrative authority to prevent monopolistic mergers . . . ."" 
Ibid.  So also, Senator Kefauver observed: ""it would have been"
22,," much better for the economy of the country to have repealed 
sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act rather than let this wide-
open loophole to remain.  Most of the large and monopolistic 
mergers which have become detrimental to the free-enterprise 
system of our Nation have occurred by way of this plain 
evasion of the intent of the original Clayton Act."" 96 Cong. 
Rec. 16451.
"
22,22," A cash purchase of another bank's assets would not seem 
to be a fully effective method of corporate acquisition. In other 
industries, a cash purchase of plant, inventory, patents, trade 
secrets, and the like will often directly enhance the competitive 
position of the acquiring corporation, as in Columbia Steel Co. 
But a bank desiring to increase its share of banking business 
through corporate acquisition would ordinarily need to acquire 
the other bank's deposits and capital, not merely its assets.  
For more deposits mean more working capital, and additions 
to capital and surplus increase the lending limit.  A cash 
purchase, in effect, only substitutes cash for cash, since bank 
assets consist principally of cash and very liquid securities and 
loans receivable, and adds nothing to the acquiring bank's 
capital and surplus or to its working capital.  True, an 
exchange of its stock for assets would achieve the acquiring 
bank's objectives.  We are clear, however, that in light of 
Congress' overriding purpose, in amending § 7, to close the 
loophole in the original section, if such an exchange (or other 
clearly evasive transaction) were tantamount in its effects to a 
merger, the exchange would not be an ""assets"" acquisition 
within the meaning of § 7 but would be treated as a 
transaction subject to that section. We have not overlooked the fact that there are corporations in 
other industries not subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.  Chief 
among these are air carriers subject to the Civil Aeronautics 
Board and other carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce 
Commission.  Both agencies have been given, expressly, 
broad powers to exempt mergers and acquisitions in whatever 
form from the antitrust laws. See 49 U. S. C. §§ 1378, 1384; 
49 U. S. C. § 5 (11) and (13).  Therefore, the exclusion of 
assets acquisitions in such industries from § 7 would seem to 
have little significance. 
 Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 21, vests the FRB 
with authority to enforce § 7 ""where applicable to banks."" This 
provision has been in the Act since it was first passed in 1914 
and was not changed by the 1950 amendments.  The Bank 
Merger Act of 1960, assigning roles in merger applications to 
the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency as well as to the 
"
22,," FRB, plainly supplanted, we think, whatever authority the FRB 
may have acquired under § 11, by virtue of the amendment of 
§ 7, to enforce § 7 against bank mergers. Since the Bank 
Merger 
Act 
applies 
only 
to 
mergers, 
consolidations, 
acquisitions of assets, and assumptions of liabilities but not to 
outright stock acquisitions, the FRB's authority under § 11 as it 
existed before the 1950 amendment of § 7 remains 
unaffected.  See, e. g., Transamerica Corp. v.  Board of Govs. 
of Fed. Res. Sys., 206 F.2d 163 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953).
 Nothing in this opinion, of course, limits the power of the FTC, 
under §§ 7 and 11, as amended, to reach any transaction, 
including mergers and consolidations, in the broad range 
between and including pure stock and pure assets 
acquisitions, where the acquiring corporation is subject to the 
FTC's jurisdiction, see 15 U. S. C. § 45 (a)(6), and to order 
divestiture of the stock, share capital, or assets acquired in the 
transaction, see 15 U. S. C. § 21.

27,," ""We have had in Philadelphia for 50 years or more the mutual

in commercial banks has kept pace with and in many of the 
banks exceeded the rate of increase of the mutual banks 
paying 3 1/2 per cent. . . .
 ""I have made some inquiries.  There are four banks on the 
corner of Broad and Chestnut.  Three of them are commercial 
banks all offering 3 per cent, and one is a mutual savings bank 
offering 3 1/2.  As far as I have been able to discover, there 
isn't anybody in Philadelphia who will take the trouble to walk 
across Broad Street to get 1/2 of 1 per cent more interest.  If 
you ask me why, I will say I do not know.  Habit, custom, 
personal relationships, convenience, doing all your banking 
under one roof appear to be factors superior to changes in the 
interest rate level."" (R. 1388-1389.)
"
27,35," Consider the following colloquy between governmental 
counsel and a witness for the defendants: ""Q. What do you consider to be the area of a branch office?
 ""A. Well, there is no set rule on that.  We hope to have an area 
from 1 1/2 to 2 miles.
 ""However, we have opened branches directly in the 
communities where other banks are established, in fact, 
across the street from them because it is not only a question 
of getting new business, it's a question of servicing and 
retaining the accounts that we now have.
 . . . . .
"
27,33," Cf.   United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 
416, 425 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1945). In the instant case, unlike 
Aluminum Co., there is virtually no time lag between the 
banks' furnishing competing financial institutions (small-loan 
companies, for example) with the raw material, i. e., money, 
and the institutions' selling the finished product, i. e., loans; 
hence the instant case, compared with Aluminum Co. in this 
respect, is a fortiori.  As one banker testified quite frankly in 
the instant case in response to the question: ""Do you feel that 
you are in substantial competition with these institutions 
[personal-finance and sales-finance companies] that you lend . 
. . such money to for loans that you want to make?"" -- ""Oh, no, 
we definitely do not.  If we did, we would stop making the 
loans to them."" (R. 298.) The reason for the competitive 
disadvantage of most lending institutions vis-a-vis banks is 
that only banks obtain the bulk of their working capital without 
having to pay interest or comparable charges thereon, by 
virtue of their unique power to accept demand deposits. The 
critical area of short-term commercial credit, see pp. 326-327, 
supra, appears to be one in which banks have little effective 
competition, save in the case of very large companies which 
can meet their financing needs from retained earnings or from 
issuing securities or paper."
27,34, As one witness for the defendants testified:
28,," of appellees' combined total business demand deposits under 
$ 10,000, 94% originate in the four-county area.  This 
reinforces the thesis that the smaller the customer, the smaller 
is his banking market geographically.  See note 35, supra.
 The appellees concede that the four-county area has sufficient 
commercial importance to qualify, under Brown Shoe Co., 
supra, at 336-337, as a ""section of the country"" within the 
meaning of § 7.  See Maryland & Va. Milk Producers Assn. v.  
United States, 362 U.S. 458, 469; cf.   United States v. Yellow 
Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 226; Indiana Farmer's Guide 
Publishing Co. v.  Prairie Farmer Publishing Co., 293 U.S. 
268, 279.
"
28,37," Appellees suggest not that bank offices skirting the four-
county 
area 
provide 
meaningful 
alternatives 
to 
bank 
customers within the area, but that such alternatives are 
provided by large banks, from New York and elsewhere, which 
solicit business in the Philadelphia area.  There is no evidence 
of the amount of business done in the area by banks with 
offices outside the area; it may be that such figures are 
unobtainable.  In any event, it would seem from the local 
orientation of banking insofar as smaller customers are 
concerned, see notes 35 and 36, supra, that competition from 
outside the area would only be important to the larger 
borrowers and depositors.  If so, the four-county area remains 
a valid geographical market in which to assess the 
anticompetitive effect of the proposed merger upon the 
banking facilities available to the smaller customer -- a 
perfectly good ""line of commerce,"" in light of Congress' evident 
concern, in enacting the 1950 amendments to § 7, with 
preserving small business.  See Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 
315-316.  As a practical matter the small businessman can 
only satisfy his credit needs at local banks.  To be sure, there 
is still some artificiality in deeming the four-county area the 
relevant ""section of the country"" so far as businessmen 
located near the perimeter are concerned.  But such fuzziness 
would seem inherent in any attempt to delineate the relevant 
geographical market.  Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 778-779, n. 
77 (1952). And it is notable that outside the four-county area, 
appellees' business rapidly thins out.  Thus, the other six 
counties of the Delaware Valley account for only 2% of 
appellees' combined individual demand deposits; 4% demand 
deposits of partnerships and corporations; 7%, loans; 2%, 
savings deposits; 4%, business time deposits."
28,," ""Q. And your business is not necessarily dependent upon it 
[the customer] being within a mile or two of a branch, is it?
 ""A. To a large degree, it is, because we found that we were 
losing deposit accounts regularly from our in-town offices 
because other banks were opening or had offices in other 
sections of the city; and in order to retain those accounts and 
to get additional business we felt it was necessary to establish 
branches."" (R. 1815.)
 As far as the customer for a bank loan is concerned, ""the size 
of his market is somewhat dependent upon his own size, how 
well he is known, and so on.  For example, for small business 
concerns known primarily locally, they may consider that their 
market is a strictly local one, and they may be forced by 
circumstances to do business with banks in a nearby 
geographic relationship to them.  On the other hand, as 
businesses increase in size, the scope of their business 
activities, their national reputation, the alternatives they have 
available to them will be spread again over a very large area, 
possibly as large as the entire United States."" (R. 1372.) 
(Defendants' testimony on direct examination.)
"
28,36," The figures for PNB and Girard respectively are: 54% and 
63% of the dollar volume of their commercial and industrial 
loans originate in the four-county area; 75% and 70%, 
personal loans; 74% and 84%, real estate loans; 41% and 
62%, lines of credit; 94% and 72%, personal trusts; 81% and 
94%, time and savings deposits; 56% and 77%, demand 
deposits; 93% and 87%, demand deposits of individuals.  
Actually, these figures may be too low.  The evidence 
discloses that most of the business done outside the area is 
with large borrowers and large depositors; appellees do not, 
by and large, deal with small businessmen and average 
individuals not located in the four-county area.  For example,"

30,40," See p. 331, supra.  We note three factors that cause us to 
shade the percentages given earlier in this opinion, in seeking 
to calculate market share.  (1) The percentages took no 
account of banks which do business in the four-county area 
but have no offices there; however, this seems to be a factor 
of little importance, at least insofar as smaller customers are 
concerned, see note 37, supra.  (2) The percentages took no 
account of banks which have offices in the four-county area 
but not their home offices there; however, there seem to be 
only two such offices and appellees in this Court make no 
reference to this omission.  (3) There are no percentages for 
the amount of business of banks located in the area, other 
than appellees, which originates in the area.  Appellees 
contend that since most of the 40 other banks are smaller, 
they do a more concentratedly local business than appellees, 
and hence account for a relatively larger proportion of such 
business.  If so, we doubt much correction is needed.  The five 
largest banks in the four-county area at present control some 
78% of the area banks' assets.  Thus, even if the small banks 
have a somewhat different pattern of business, it is difficult to 
see how that would substantially diminish the appellees' share 
of the local banking business. No evidence was introduced as to the quantitative significance 
of these three factors, and appellees do not contend that as a 
practical matter such evidence could have been obtained.  
Under the circumstances, we think a downward correction of 
the percentages to 30% produces a conservative estimate of 
"
30,," appellees' market share.
"
30,41," Kaysen and Turner, supra, note 38, suggest that 20% 
should be the line of prima facie unlawfulness; Stigler 
suggests that any acquisition by a firm controlling 20% of the 
market after the merger is presumptively unlawful; Markham 
mentions 25%.  Bok's principal test is increase in market 
concentration, and he suggests a figure of 7% or 8%.  And 
consult note 20, supra.  We intimate no view on the validity of 
such tests for we have no need to consider percentages 
smaller than those in the case at bar, but we note that such 
tests are more rigorous than is required to dispose of the 
instant case.  Needless to say, the fact that a merger results in 
a less-than-30% market share, or in a less substantial 
increase in concentration than in the instant case, does not 
raise an inference that the merger is not violative of § 7.  See, 
e. g., Brown Shoe Co., supra."
30,42," See note 41, supra.  It is no answer that, among the three 
presently largest firms (First Pennsylvania, PNB, and Girard), 
there will be no increase in concentration. If this argument 
were valid, then once a market had become unduly 
concentrated, further concentration would be legally privileged.  
On the contrary, if concentration is already great, the 
importance 
of 
preventing 
even 
slight 
increases 
in 
concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventual 
deconcentration is correspondingly great.  Comment, note 39, 
supra, at 1644."
31,43," The fact that some of the bank officers who testified 
represented small banks in competition with appellees does 
not substantially enhance the probative value of their 
testimony.  HN15[
] The test of a competitive market is not 
only whether small competitors flourish but also whether 
consumers are well served.  See  United States v. Bethlehem 
Steel Corp., 168 F.Supp. 576, 588, 592 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 
1958). ""Congressional concern [was] with the protection of 
competition, not competitors."" Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 320.  
In an oligopolistic market, small companies may be perfectly 
content to follow the high prices set by the dominant firms, yet 
the market may be profoundly anticompetitive."
31,44," Entry is, of course, wholly a matter of governmental grace.  
See p. 328, supra.  In the 10-year period ending in 1961, only 
one new bank opened in the Philadelphia four-county area.  
That was in 1951.  At the end of 10 years, the new bank 
controlled only one-third of 1% of the area's deposits."
32,45," The following colloquy is representative: ""Q. Mr. Jennings, what is the nature of competition among 
commercial banks?
 ""A. Keen, highly competitive. I think, from my own observation, 
that I have never known competition among banks to be 
keener than it is today. . . .
 ""Q. In what area does competition exist? . . .
 ""A. I think the stiffest, sternest competition of all is in the field 
to obtain demand deposits and loans. . . .
 ""Q. What form does the competition take?
 ""A. It takes many forms.  If we are dealing with the deposits of 
large corporations, wealthy individuals, I would say that most, 
if not all, of the major banks of the country are competing for 
such deposits. The same would hold true as regards loans to 
those corporations or wealthy individuals.
 ""If we go into the field of smaller loans, smaller deposits, the 
competition is more regional -- wide but nevertheless regional 
-- and there the large banks as well as the small banks are 
after that business with everything they have.
 . . . .
 ""Q. What form does the competition take?  Is it competition in 
price?
 ""A. No, I wouldn't say that it is competition as to price.  After 
all, interest rates are regulated at the top level by the laws of 
the 50 states.  Interest rates at the bottom level have no legal 
limitation, but for practical purposes the prime rate . . . 
furnishes a very effective floor.  I would say that the area of 
competition for interest rates would range between, let us say, 
the prime rate of 4 1/2 and 6 per cent for normal loans 
exclusive of consumer loans, where higher rates are 
permitted.
 . . . .
 ""In the area of service charges, I would say that banks are 
competitive in that field.  They base their service charges 
primarily on their costs, but they have to maintain a weather 
eye to windward as to what the competitors are charging in the 
service charge field.  The minute they get out of line in 
connection with service charges they find their customers will 
start to protest, and if something isn't done some of the 
customers will leave them for a differential in service charges 
of any significance.
 ""I do not believe that competition is really affected by the price 
area.  I think it is affected largely by the quality and the caliber 
of service that banks give and whether or not they feel they 
are being received in the right way, whether they are welcome 
in the bank.  Personalities enter into it very heavily, but I do 
"
32,," not think price as such is a major factor in banking 
competition.  It is there, it is a factor, but not major."" (R. 1940-
1942.)
 It should be noted that besides competition in interest rates, 
there is a great deal of indirect price competition in the 
banking industry. For example, the amount of compensating 
balance a bank requires of a borrower (i. e., the amount the 
borrower must always retain in his demand deposit account 
with the bank) affects the real cost of the loan, and varies 
considerably in the bank's discretion.
"
33,46," Thus, arguably, the so-called failing-company defense, see 
International Shoe Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 280 U.S. 
291, 299-303, might have somewhat larger contours as 
applied to bank mergers because of the greater public impact 
of a bank failure compared with ordinary business failures.  
But the question what defenses in § 7 actions must be allowed 
in order to avert unsound banking conditions is not before us, 
and we intimate no view upon it."

of the factors which led to the panic of 1907. ""The banking collapse in the early 1930's again was in large 
part the result of insufficient regulation and control of banks, in 
effect the result of too much competition."" See also 105 Cong. 
Rec. 8076 (1959): ""But unlimited and unrestricted competition 
in banking is just not possible.  We have had too many panics 
and banking crises and bank failures, largely as the result of 
excessive competition in banking, to consider for a moment 
going back to the days of free banking or unregulated 
banking.""

38,23," 106 Cong. Rec. 7257 (1960): ""This puts the responsibility for 
acting on a proposed merger where it belongs -- in the agency 
charged with supervising and examining the bank which will 
result from the merger. Out of their years of experience in 
supervising banks, our Federal banking agencies have 
developed specialized knowledge of banking and the people 
who engage in it.  They are experts at judging the condition of 
the banks involved, their prospects, their management, and 
the needs of the community for banking services.  They should 
have primary responsibility in deciding whether a proposed 
merger would be in the public interest."" (Emphasis added.)"
38,24," H. R. Rep. No. 1416, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 11-12 (1960): 
""We are convinced, also, that approval of a merger should 
depend on a positive showing of some benefit to be derived 
from it.  As previously indicated, your committee is not 
prepared to say that the cases enumerated in the hearings are 
the only instances in which a merger is in the public interest, 
nor are we prepared to devise a specific and exclusive list of 
situations in which a merger should be approved."""
38,25," Compare State Board of Ins. v.  Todd Shipyards Corp., 
370 U.S. 451, 457, in which this Court refused to reconsider 
certain prior decisions because Congress had ""posited a 
regime of state regulation"" of the insurance business on their 
continuing validity.  Cf.   Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 
346 U.S. 356."
38,26," If a bank merger such as this falls within the category of a 
""stock"" acquisition, a § 7 suit to enjoin it may be brought not 
only by the Attorney General, but by the Federal Reserve 
Board as well.  See § 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 21 
(vesting authority in the Board to enforce § 7 ""where 
applicable to banks"").  In an attempt to retain some semblance 
of the structure erected by Congress in the Bank Merger Act, 
the Court states that it ""supplanted . . . whatever authority the 
FRB may have acquired under § 11, by virtue of the 
amendment of § 7, to enforce § 7 against bank mergers."" 
Ante, p. 344, note 22.  Since both the Attorney General and 
the Federal Reserve Board have purely advisory roles where a 
bank merger will result in a national bank, the Court's 
reasoning with respect to the effect of the Bank Merger Act 
upon enforcement authority should apply with equal force to 
both."
38,27," Indeed the Court has erected a simple yardstick in order to 
alleviate the agony of analyzing economic data -- control of 
30% of a commercial banking market is prohibited.  Ante, pp. 
363-364."
38,28," Although § 7 of the Clayton Act is applicable to an outright 
purchase of bank stock, this form of amalgamation is 
infrequently used in the banking field and does not involve 
divestiture problems of the same magnitude as does an asset 
acquisition."
39,29," It is true, as the Court points out (ante, p. 354), that 
Congress, in enacting the Bank Merger Act, agreed that the 
applicability of the Sherman Act to banking should not be 
disturbed.  See, e. g., 105 Cong. Rec. 8076 (1959).  But surely 
this alone provides no conceivable justification for applying the 
Clayton Act as well.  Apart from the fact that the Sherman Act 
covers many kinds of restraints besides mergers, one of the 
sponsors of the Bank Merger Act (Senator Fulbright) 
expressed his expectation that in a Sherman Act case a bank 
merger would not be subjected to strict antitrust standards to 
the exclusion of all other considerations: ""And even if the 
Sherman Act is held to apply to banking and to bank mergers, 
it seems clear that under the rule of reason spelled out in the 
Standard Oil case, different considerations will be found 
applicable, in a regulated field like banking, in determining 
whether activities would 'unduly diminish competition,' in the 
words of the Supreme Court in that case."" 106 Cong. Rec. 
9711 (1960).  Moreover, this Court has recognized in other 
areas that it may be necessary to accommodate the Sherman 
Act to regulatory policy.  McLean Trucking Co. v.  United 
States, 321 U.S. 67, 83;  Federal Communications Comm'n v. 
RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 91-92. See also  
United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 527. And 
of course the Sherman Act is concerned more with existing 
anticompetitive effects than with future probabilities, and thus 
would not reach incipient restraints to the same extent as 
would § 7 of the Clayton Act. See Brown Shoe Co. v.  United 
States, 370 U.S. 294, 317-318 and notes 32, 33."
40,30," In these respects a merger is precisely the contrary of what 
§ 7 was originally designed to proscribe -- the secret 
acquisition of corporate control.  See the Court's opinion, ante, 
p. 338."
40,31," That the stock-acquisition provision was not intended to 
cover mergers is strongly suggested by the second paragraph 
of § 7: ""No corporation shall acquire . . . any part of the stock . 
. . of one or more corporations . . . where . . . the effect . . . of 
the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies . . . 
may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create 
a monopoly."" 15 U. S. C. § 18. (Emphasis added.) After a 
merger has been consummated, the resulting corporation 
holds no stock in any party to the merger; thus there can be in"
40,," this situation no such thing as a restraint of trade by ""the use"" 
of the voting power of acquired stock.
"
41,32," On this point, the dissenters agreed: ""It is true that the 
Clayton Act does not forbid corporate mergers . . . .""  291 U.S., 
at 600. See also  United States v. Celanese Corp. of America, 
91 F.Supp. 14."

Committee on the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st & 2d Sess. 109-

Thatcher Mfg. Co. v.  FTC (272 U.S. 554); Arrow-Hart & 
Hegeman Co. v.  FTC (291 U.S. 587).) In these decisions the 
Supreme Court held that section 7 of the Clayton Act, while 
prohibiting the acquisition of stock of a competitor, gave the 
Federal Trade Commission no authority under section 11 to 
order divestiture of assets which had been acquired before a 
cease-and-desist order was issued, even though the 
acquisition resulted from the voting of illegally held stock."""

41,37," The single excerpt quoted by the Court (ante, p. 345) casts 
no doubt on this proposition, for Senator Kilgore's remark

to make the point that there is no difference in practical effect, 
as opposed to the legal distinction, between a merger and a 
stock acquisition. Thus at the end of the paragraph quoted by 
the Court the Senator stated: "". . . I cannot see how on earth

corporation, all of it, does not carry with it the transfer of all of
