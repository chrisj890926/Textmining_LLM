12,1," In 1996, NYNEX was the incumbent LEC for New York State.  
NYNEX subsequently merged with Bell Atlantic Corporation, 
and the merged entity retained the Bell Atlantic name; a 
further merger produced Verizon.  We use ""Verizon"" to refer to 
NYNEX and Bell Atlantic as well."
15,3," LEdHN[8B][
] [8B] Respondent also relies upon United States v. Terminal R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 
S. Ct. 507 (1912), and Associated Press v. United States, 326 
U.S. 1, 89 L. Ed. 2013, 65 S. Ct. 1416 (1945).  These cases 
involved 
concerted 
action, 
which 
presents 
greater 
anticompetitive concerns and is amenable to a remedy that 
does not require judicial estimation of free-market forces: 
simply requiring that the outsider be granted nondiscriminatory 
admission to the club.

17,4," LEdHN[1H][

] [10B] The Court of 
Appeals also thought that respondent's complaint might state 
a claim under a ""monopoly leveraging"" theory (a theory barely 
discussed by respondent, see Brief for Respondent 24, n 10).  
We disagree.  To the extent the Court of Appeals dispensed 
with a requirement that there be a ""dangerous probability of 
success"" in monopolizing a second market, it erred, Spectrum 
Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993).  In any event, leveraging 
presupposes anticompetitive conduct, which in this case could 
only be the refusal-to-deal claim we have rejected."
18,5," Our disposition makes it unnecessary to consider petitioner's 
alternative contention that respondent lacks antitrust standing.  
See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 
97, and n 2, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998); 
National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass'n of R.R. 
Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 456, 38 L. Ed. 2d 646, 94 S. Ct. 
690 (1974)."
