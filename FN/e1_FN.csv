28,5," The majority in Battipaglia expressly recognized that its suggestion, but not holding, that the regulatory scheme at issue might 
enjoy state action immunity if it otherwise constituted a per se violation of § 1 was contrary to the conclusion reached by ""the 
most influential treatise on the subject, Areeda & Turner, 1 Antitrust Law P 213d, at 75 (1978)."" 745 F.2d at 176. Professor 
Areeda and his colleagues subsequently considered the observations made by the majority in Battipaglia and were 
unpersuaded, both on the issue of whether the New York regulatory scheme involved a per se violation of § 1 and whether there 
was state action immunity. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 217, at 311. Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp also found the 
Ninth Circuit's decision in Miller, supra, to apply properly the approach employed by the Supreme Court in Midcal. Id. at 311-12. "
30,6," The Second Circuit decided Battipaglia in 1984, two years before the Supreme Court's decision in Fisher. Thus, the Second 
Circuit did not analyze whether the New York regulatory scheme at issue created a ""hybrid restraint."" "
32,7," The fact that the regulatory scheme at issue effects a per se violation of § 1 renders immaterial any dispute that may be 
created by competing affidavits in this case concerning whether the ability to amend a posted price downward in certain 
circumstances is anticompetitive or procompetitive. Compare Statement of Phoebe Morse, Director of the Boston Regional 
Office of the Federal Trade Commission, Appendix to Whitehall's Motion for Summary Judgment, Exh. C, and Statement and 
Affidavits of Daniel S. Levy, Memorandum in Support of MWMBI's Motion for Summary Judgment, Exh. C, D; Opposition of 
MWMBI to Plaintiff's Motions for Summary Judgment, Exh. B. It is this type of complicated economic analysis that a per se rule 
moots. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 356 U.S. at 5 (""This principle of per se unreasonableness … avoids the necessity for an 
incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as well as related 
industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable -- an inquiry so often wholly 
fruitless when undertaken.""). "
34,8," However, since the parties have agreed that the record is complete concerning this issue and that it can be resolved on 
summary judgment, in the interest of completeness I note that there is little evidence that the Commission exercises any 
conceivable power it might have to try to assure the reasonableness of prices for wholesale liquor. Mr. Krusell, a former Commissioner, gave some testimony with regard to his activities in considering the reasonableness of 
prices. Memorandum in Support of MWMBI's Motion for Summary Judgment, Exh. F (Stuart Krusell Deposition Transcript), at 
2:84, 3:58-59. There is considerably more evidence indicating that the Commission does not actively seek to evaluate or assure 
the reasonableness of prices. For example, there is no document in the record showing that the Commission ever reviewed, let 
alone approved, the reasonableness of a wholesale liquor price. The depositions of Commission employees Robert Temple and 
Peter Connelly are consistent with the conclusion that the Commission did not do this. Appendix to Whitehall's Opposition, Exh. 
5 (Robert Temple Deposition Transcript), at 34, 90-91; Appendix to Whitehall's Opposition, Exh. 4 (Peter Connelly Deposition 
Transcript), at 41-44, 48-50. "
53,1," Volatile memory is more commonly referred to as ""random-access memory"" (RAM); while nonvolatile memory is known as 
""read-only memory"" (ROM). Generally speaking, both RAM and ROM are computer chips that store data electronically. The 
technical details of how this is done are not relevant to this case. Because a computer can only store, read, and delete data in 
RAM while the computer has power, it is called volatile memory. The data held in RAM disappears when the computer is turned 
off. The data stored in ROM does not disappear when the computer is off. Because of the way the ROM chip stores the data, 
however, the computer cannot store fresh data or otherwise alter data stored in ROM. ROM is thus called nonvolatile memory."

56,29," In his affidavit Microsoft senior software development designer Ralph Lipe gave a specific example of what could happen: One of the most frequently accessed portions of a hard disk is the index of its contents, called the File Allocation Table (or 
FAT). Because the FAT is being read from and written to constantly, it is almost always present in the disk cache's memory 
space [the cache in RAM]. If the copy of the FAT being maintained in the disk cache gets out of synchronization with the 
original FAT on the hard disk, the entire hard disk can be rendered useless when the FAT on the hard disk is overwritten by 
the copy of the FAT in the disk cache's memory space. Once the index to the contents of a hard disk has been corrupted, 
the operating system will be unable to find particular information on the hard disk, which typically is not stored sequentially. 
That includes, for example, not only documents created using a word processing program like Microsoft Word but also the 
word processing program -- and perhaps the operating system itself. Lipe Affidavit P 17."

user attempts to install Cache86 on a computer that already operates under Windows95. (Aldridge Deposition at 83; Lipe

58,56, Lipe Affidavit Exhibit B.
58,57," A computer's AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains the master task list that MS-DOS and Windows95 initially use to set up the 
computer when it is first turned on. AUTOEXEC stands for ""automatic execution."" BAT tells the operating system that this is a 
batch file. Batch files contain a series of commands for the computer to execute. When a user starts MS-DOS or Windows95 the operating system searches the hard disk for AUTOEXEC.BAT and executes 
each command contained in that file. AUTOEXEC.BAT is thus an essential file opened by the operating system every time a 
user turns on the computer. When a user installs Cache86 on a computer Cache86 edits the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include a command to open and begin 
running Cache86. The computer recognizes Cache86 by its filename, C86EXTEN. Thus, when the message says ""C86EXTEN 
in AUTOEXEC.BAT,"" it is telling the user that it found Cache86 in the list of programs to run in AUTOEXEC.BAT."

downstream market, which we shall call market # 2. If the facility is truly ""essential,"" then the # 1 monopoly facility also

Aspen Highlands Skiing. See Aspen Skiing Co., 105 S. Ct. at 2862 n.44. However, to the extent that the Tenth Circuit's 
application of the essential facilities doctrine is relevant, the facility there would fall under the first category, natural monopoly,

facilities on existing slopes. See Twin Lab., Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 569 (2d Cir. 1990) (categorizing 
Aspen Skiing). Cf. IIIA Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, PP 772c1-c2 (rev. ed. 1996) (criticizing the Tenth Circuit's essential

102,1," Remington asserts that the Howard Johnson hotel is actually owned by Middletown New York Limited Partnership and that 
Remington acts only as consultant to the operator of the hotel, Remington Employers Corporation. Defendant's Amended 
Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 3(g), PP 1-3. Nevertheless, Remington has not raised the issue of ownership in the context of 
this motion. "
106,2," In fact, where a counterclaim is permissive, rather than compulsory, there is no basis for federal jurisdiction after the primary 
claim has been dismissed. See Harris v. Steinem, 571 F.2d 119, 121-25 (2d Cir. 1978); see also Scott v. Long Island Savings 
Bank, FSB, 937 F.2d 738, 743 (2d Cir. 1991). "
118,1," HN5[
] Section 553.4 provides, ""A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons shall not restrain or monopolize trade or commerce in a relevant market."" HN6[
] Section 553.5 provides, ""A person shall not attempt to establish . . . a monopoly of trade or commerce in a relevant market for the purpose of excluding competition or of controlling, fixing, or 
maintaining prices."" "
136,1, Plaintiffs do not state which Defendants participated in the alleged character assassination. 
137,2," The pleadings do not state the length of the contract, when it expires, or how it may be renewed."
137,3," At some unidentified time, but presumably before September 1995, the MES appointed three of its members, not defendants in 
this case, to an ad hoc committee to investigate charges against Davies. The complaint alleges that the committee did not 
contact Davies, but interviewed his competitors and people hostile to him. "
140,4," At the hearing on this matter, Plaintiffs argued, in another context, that the defendants on the ASC were acting as A&A's 
agents. If the Defendants on the ASC were responsible for the acts alleged to be mail and wire fraud, A&A and Genesis cannot 
be held responsible on a theory of respondeat superior. Luthi v. Tonka Corp., 815 F.2d 1229, 1230 (8th Cir. 1987) (declining to 
apply respondeat superior doctrine to RICO claims); Prochaska & Assocs., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, 798 F. 
Supp. 1427, 1431 (D. Neb. 1992); K&S Partnership v. Continental Bank, 127 F.R.D. 664, 669 (D. Neb. 1989). "
141,5," HN12[
] The HCQIA provides qualified immunity from damages actions for hospitals, doctors and other participants in 
professional peer review proceedings, if the participants have met certain standards, including affording adequate notice and 
hearing procedures to the physician under review. Brown, M.D. v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 101 F.3d 1324, 1333 (10th 
Cir. 1996); see 42 U.S.C. §§ 11111(a)(1), 11112(a) (1994). "
142,5," Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs have failed to allege they are entitled to relief under the Clayton Act. Because Plaintiffs 
could easily remedy this deficiency in an amended complaint, the Court does not analyze the issue. "
143,6," Unpublished decisions have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., Patel v. Scotland Mem. Hosp., 91 F.3d 132 
(unpublished table decision), 1996 WL 383920, at *4 (4th Cir. 1996) (dismissing for failure to state Sherman Act claim, where 
nurse anesthetist failed to adequately allege facts necessary to demonstrate antitrust injury; complaint focused on injuries 
anesthetist incurred, not those the competitive market incurred; stating anesthetist alleged only staffing decision and personal 
economic injury); Huhta v. Children's Hosp. of Philadelphia, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7327, No. Civ. A. 93-2765, 1994 WL 245454, 
at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 31, 1994) (holding pediatric cardiologist's loss of referrals and lost revenue as result of hospital's bar to him 
using pediatric cardiology equipment and facilities was not antitrust injury; ""The harm alleged in the complaint is really only harm 
to the individual doctor, and not to competition within the marketplace""), order aff'd, 52 F.3d 315 (3d Cir. 1995). "
146,7," Plaintiffs asserted A&A raised prices, but do not specify for which services prices were raised, or that the prices were raised 
higher than to a competitive level. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have not adequately pled a causal connection between harm to Plaintiffs and any alleged 
concerted action by Defendants in violation of the Sherman Act. "
149,8," The Court cannot ignore the commercial reality, well known in Iowa, that UIHC is a major tertiary care center, any more than it 
could ignore in an antitrust case involving proposed markets for county fairs the existence of the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. As noted in another case, ""[A] significant number of Dubuque residents use the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics . . . a 
ninety mile drive, due to quality concerns."" Mercy Health Servs., 902 F. Supp. at 982. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that 
a significant number of Quad Cities residents use the UIHC, which for them is approximately a 56-mile drive. Not to consider the 
impact of UIHC on this market would be similar to ignoring an elephant in the room. "
150,9," HN34[
] The Eighth Circuit does not require as rigorous a showing for the relevant market in the context of a conspiracy claim as for a showing for the relevant market for other Section 2 claims. See Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1182 (holding civil conspiracy 
claim, standing alone, requires at least minimal showing of product and geographic context to ensure claim is not based on 
some abstract showing of unlawful intent). Even applying a less rigorous standard than for Plaintiffs' other Section 2 claims, the 
Court holds that for the reasons outlined above, Plaintiffs have not adequately pled the showing of a relevant market required for 
a Section 2 conspiracy claim. To hold otherwise would permit a fact finder to infer a conspiracy where such an inference is "
151,," implausible. Cf. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 593, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) 
(analyzing market in context of whether alleged conspirators had plausible chance of achieving monopoly in market, and 
therefore motive for conspiring; stating courts should not permit fact finders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are 
implausible, because otherwise procompetitive conduct could be deterred)."
151,12," The Court notes that several courts have determined that shareholders in professional corporations were not ""employees"" for 
purposes of determining whether a corporation had the required number of employees to qualify as a ""employer"" under Title VII. 
See Devine v. Stone, Leyton & Gershman, 100 F.3d 78, 82 (8th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 137 L. Ed. 2d 821, 117 S. Ct. 1694 
(1997) (holding attorney shareholder-directors of professional corporation were not employees; adopting ""form over substance"" 
test); Goudeau v. Dental Health Servs., Inc., 901 F. Supp. 1139, 1147 (M.D. La. 1995) (holding dentist shareholders in 
professional corporation were not employees; where management, ownership, and control of corporation resembled that of 
partnership). However, because this is raised as a motion to dismiss, the Court makes no findings as to the number of 
employees A&A has. "
152,13," HN39[
] ""Relevant market"" is defined as ""the geographical area of actual or potential competition in a line of commerce, all or any part of which is within this state."" Iowa Code § 553.3(6)."
152,14," HN42[
] The Sherman Act, Section 2's, prohibition against conspiracy to monopolize has a counterpart in Iowa Code §"
152,553," .4, which also prohibits the restraint of trade: ""A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons shall not 
restrain or monopolize trade or commerce in a relevant market."" Iowa Code § 553.4. "
153,15," In their brief in resistance to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs requested leave to amend the Second Corrected 
Amended Complaint if the Court granted Defendants' motions. HN44[
] Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that leave to amend ""shall be given freely when justice so requires."" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222, 
83 S. Ct. 227 (1962); see In re NationsMart Corp. Securities Litigation v. Thaman, 130 F.3d 309, 322 (8th Cir. 1997). Permission 
to amend may, however, be denied where amendment would be futile.  Taylor v. United States, 106 F.3d 833, 838 (8th Cir. 
1997). Plaintiffs have not submitted a proposed amendment. Although approximately five months have passed since Defendants filed 
their motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs have made no attempt to remedy the defects in the Second Corrected Amended Complaint 
identified by Defendants. Plaintiffs have already amended their complaint twice, the second time in response to Defendants' first 
round of motions to dismiss. Nothing in Plaintiffs' brief in support of their resistance to the motions to dismiss indicates what a 
third amended complaint would have contained. ""HN45[
] Absent some indication as to what might be added to the complaint 
to make it viable, the appellant is not entitled to leave to amend."" Wolgin v. Simon, 722 F.2d 389, 395 (8th Cir. 1983) (affirming 
district court's denial of leave to amend, where in brief in opposition to motion to dismiss, plaintiff requested leave to amend 
complaint, but did not submit proposed amendment; court could not rule on question of amendment, and granting leave to 
amend would have been inappropriate); accord Clayton v. White Hall School District, 778 F.2d 457, 460 (8th Cir. 1985); cf. 
Oliver v. Resolution Trust Corp., 955 F.2d 583, 584 (8th Cir. 1992). For these reasons, and because the contradictions between the facts pled and the claims asserted persuade the Court that any 
attempt to amend would be futile, the Court denies Plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint for a third time. See Patel, 91 
F.3d 132, 1996 WL 383920, at *4. "
165,*," Honorable Harry W. Wellford, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
166,1," Nurse qualifications fall into at least three different licensing categories: Registered Nurse (RN), Licensed Practical Nurse 
(LPN), and Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA)."
166,2, These temporary nursing agencies are also providers of travel and contract nurses to hospitals.
166,3," The problems described formed the basis of the counterclaim against All Care and Monahan for federal and state RICO 
violations."
166,4," Some of the appellant agencies participated in the bidding process, others did not. Following the submission of the initial bids 
four (4) agencies were eliminated based on their bid prices, which in some instances were 50% higher than other agencies' bids. 
The remaining twelve (12) rebid and were considered using the established criteria. Which agencies actually resubmitted bids is "
167,," unclear. But, all of the accepted agencies bid prices higher than the price ranges suggested by the SFHA in its invitation to bid. 
None of the appellants was selected as preferred providers."
167,5," The hospitals felt the need to place some of the financial burden on the agencies because after the bidding, agency services 
were actually costing more than before the PPP. These contract provisions were a way to shift some of the cost back to the 
agencies."
167,6," Plaintiffs-appellants include: All Care Nursing Services, Inc.; A Complete Health Care Services, Inc.; Benson's Health Care 
Services, Inc.; Critical Health Care, Inc.; Quality Professional Nursing of Florida, Inc.; and P.D.Q. Nurse, Inc. Defendants-appellees include the SFHA, twelve (12) Palm Beach County hospitals, and four (4) remaining agency defendants 
(four (4) agencies settled with plaintiffs before final disposition in the district court)."
167,7," Claims of fraud, civil theft, and false representation against All Care and Monahan were dismissed before trial."
167,8, Also affirmed is the district court's decision in the bench trial of Defendant High Tech's Lanham Act counterclaim. 
168,9," Defendants argue that Monahan cannot be afforded the benefit of the economic-loss rule because she, individually, entered 
into no contract with the defendant hospitals: she lacked privity of contract. All contracts were between her agency, All Care, and 
the hospitals. Because we conclude that the economic-loss rule does not bar RICO claims, state or federal, we need not decide 
this question. But, the Florida Supreme Court has held, at least under one set of facts, that privity is not required for the 
economic-loss rule to apply. See Casa Clara Condominium Ass'n v. Charley Toppino and Sons, Inc., 620 So. 2d 1244 
(Fla.1993); see also Hoseline, Inc. v. U.S.A. Diversified Products, Inc., 40 F.3d 1198, 1200 (11th Cir.1994) (where this court 
applied Casa Clara to make ""meritless"" a claim that the rule does not bar tort claims between parties who lack contractual 
privity)."
168,10," Plaintiffs-appellants also challenged the RICO counterclaims on another ground: that reliance on the alleged 
misrepresentations made by All Care and Monahan was not proved by defendants. HN3[
] Reliance is only an element of a 
RICO claim to the extent that a RICO plaintiff must prove he was injured by reason of the RICO defendant's deception and fraud.  
Pelletier v. Zweifel, 921 F.2d 1465, 1499 (11th Cir.1991). But, no argument is made by the plaintiffs-appellants that injury was 
inadequately shown. So, lack of reliance does not require reversal on this claim."
168,11," HN5[
] Federal and Florida antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law. Fla. Stat. § 542.32 (""It is the intent of the Legislature that, in construing this chapter, due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the 
federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust statutes.""); see also St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, 
Inc., 457 So. 2d 1028, 1032 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984) (""The Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body 
of antitrust law developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act.""); Fla. Stat. §§ 542.16 (Florida antitrust laws 
complement federal antitrust laws), 542.18 (analogous to § 1 of the Sherman Act). So, for purposes of this opinion discussion of 
the law under the Sherman Act is equally applicable to the plaintiffs-appellants' state antitrust claims. "
169,12," If we decide the PPP is deserving of per se treatment the case ends; plaintiffs-appellants must win. But if we decide that 
conduct such as the establishment of the PPP does not rise to the level of anti-competitiveness necessary to hold it per se 
illegal, the rule of reason applies; and we will defer to the determination of the jury--that plaintiffs-appellants failed to establish 
the relevant market in which to judge the PPP's reasonableness. "
170,13," That the SFHA--when it requested bids--suggested a price range to the participating agencies does not create an agreement 
on the prices they would accept. As shown by the accepted bids, prices outside the range were acceptable."
170,14," The alleged attempt to fix prices by the hospitals' agreement with each other would be horizontal--an agreement among 
competitors. The alleged attempt to fix prices by the hospitals' agreements with the preferred agencies would be vertical. "
172,15," Because this case is subject to the rule of reason and because of the importance of relevant market and market power in 
evaluating the reasonableness of a purported restraint, the district court's jury instructions and interrogatories directing that the 
jurors must find for defendants if plaintiffs failed to establish the relevant market were proper applications of the law governing 
this case."
172,16," The interrogatories, among other things, directed the jury to find for the defendants if the plaintiffs did not establish the 
necessary relevant market. "
176,1," Although RADS initially named Dr. Porter as a defendant, the parties stipulated to his dismissal. See Order of Dismissal as to 
Defendant, Arthur Porter, M.D. (Sept. 25, 1997). The parties have not addressed how Dr. Porter's dismissal affects RADS's claim of conspiracy."
176,2," As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recently stated: Under the caselaw, it is not enough for the plaintiff to claim economic injury: ""Plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, which is 
to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants' 
acts unlawful."" Valley Products Co. v. Landmark, a Div. of Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc., 128 F.3d 398, 402 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977)). "
177,3," The statute reads: HN2[
] The establishment, maintenance, or use of a monopoly, or any attempt to establish a monopoly, of trade or 
commerce in a relevant market by any person, for the purpose of excluding or limiting competition or controlling, fixing, or 
maintaining prices, is unlawful. M.S.A. § 28.70(3)."
177,4," The statute reads: A contract, combination, or conspiracy between 2 or more persons in restraint of, or to monopolize, trade or commerce in a 
relevant market is unlawful. M.S.A. § 28.70(2)."
177,5, The statute reads: 
178,," HN3[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States… shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony…."
178,15, U.S.C. § 1.
178,6," The statute reads: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States… is hereby declared to be illegal."
178,15, U.S.C. § 2.
178,7," RADS points out that remedies under state and federal antitrust law vary, but RADS does not dispute that analysis of an 
antitrust injury is essentially the same under both state and federal antitrust law. See Kelley ex rel. Slay v. Michigan Nat'l Bank, 
377 Mich. 481, 492, 141 N.W.2d 73 (1966) (""In examining any combination, the overriding test, of course, is protection of the 
public interest.""); Goldman v. Loubella Extendables, 91 Mich. App. 212, 219, 283 N.W.2d 695 (1979) (""The Michigan antitrust act 
is patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and Federal court interpretations of the Sherman Act are 
persuasive authority as to the meaning of the Michigan act."")."
178,8," RADS correctly notes that HN5[
] federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal antitrust claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 4. Nevertheless, it is settled law that state-court judgments on state antitrust claims may preclude a federal court from deciding 
federal antitrust claims. See Marrese, 470 U.S. at 380 (""Our decisions indicate that a state court judgment may in some 
circumstances have preclusive effect in a subsequent action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.""). "
179,9," In addition, going beyond issue preclusion, clearly RADS's complaint must be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). There 
is no allegation of an injury to competition since the relevant market consists only of Mercy's cancer patients. It has not been 
alleged that Mercy possesses ""dominance"" over area residents. See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 
26, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). Mercy is permitted to enter into exclusive contracts for medical services, thereby 
limiting the choices of its patients. See id. at 31. "
187,1," In the merits appeal, this court affirmed in part and reversed in part, with no mention of the Coudert fee issue.  Image Technical 
Servs. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 1997). "
197,1," Defendants argue that plaintiffs' objections ""are best raised in other, more appropriate state proceedings,"" and that judicial 
economy requires denial of plaintiffs' request for relief. These arguments are without merit in light of explicit statutory authority 
granting this court jurisdiction to hear this appeal. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1292(a)(1), 1331. "
199,2," The parties erroneously contend that the district court dismissed the State and the Attorney General. A court speaks through its 
orders. Although the court's opinion concluded the Attorney General is not charged with enforcement of the licensing statutes, 
the order only provides ""McNeilus' claim under the Sherman Antitrust Act, as it relates to the State of Ohio, is DISMISSED."" 
(App. 63-64.) See also id. at 4."
199,3," That Amendment provides that ""the Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or 
equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens or another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of 
any Foreign State."" U.S. CONST. amend. XI."
199,4," There is a question as to whether the dismissal of the State of Ohio is properly before us in these proceedings. However, since 
plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that a dismissal as to the State of Ohio only was proper, we find it unnecessary to address 
the jurisdictional issue."
199,5," The plaintiffs also challenge the district court's determination that plaintiffs failed to name a defendant who is charged with 
enforcement of the statutes at issue in this case. It was revealed at oral argument that plaintiffs have subsequently added as 
defendants in this lawsuit Ohio's county and city prosecutors, who defendants concede, are the proper suable entities. 
Therefore, we need not address this matter further. "
201,1," ""Hematology tests"" involve the counting of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and associated diagnostic information."
201,2," ""Consumables"" are products used to treat blood samples before their analysis by the instrument."
201,3," A ""qualified lead"" is the identification of potential customers who have expressed interest in the purchasing of a product. (Pl. 
SMF ¶ 4.) "
203,4," Section 3 of the Clayton Act states: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or 
contract for sale of goods . . . for use, consumption, or resale within the United States . . . on the condition, agreement, or 
understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods . . . of a competitor or competitors of 
the lessor or seller where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for Sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding 
may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
203,15, U.S.C. § 14.
203,5," Under § 1 of the Sherman Act, an exclusive dealing contract is unlawful if it illegally restrains trade. 15 U.S.C. § 1. For 
purposes of this case, the analysis of Section 3 of the Clayton Act encompasses the standard prescribed for in § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See Tampa Electric, 365 at 335. This Court further notes that Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-29 is patterned after, and 
substantially similar  [**12] to, § 3 of the Clayton Act. Therefore, examination under the Clayton Act obviates the need for a 
separate analysis under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-29. See State v. Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., 181 Conn. 655, 436 A.2d 284, 288 
(Conn. 1980). "
204,6, CDC and IDEXX instruments are in-clinic instruments.
204,7," (See, inter alia, Pl. Ex. 2 at 1004005; Def. Ex. 22 at CDC 000230.) "
205,8," CDC's per se claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act is unavailing. So long as vertical arrangements between manufacturers and 
distributors do not involve explicit price-fixing, they are to be judged under the rule of reason test. Business Electronics Corp. v. 
Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 726, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). The Court notes that exclusive dealings 
arrangements have never been held to a per se violation of antitrust laws. See Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., 552 
F.2d 90, 101 (3d Cir. 1977); see also, Wayne D. Collins, Tying and Exclusive Arrangements, 720 PLI/Corp. 153, *258 (1991). "
207,9," Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine to conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of trade of commerce ... shall be deemed guilty of a felony."
207,10," The elements of Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-27 are substantially similar to the elements under § 2 of the Sherman Act. See 
Westport Taxi Serv., Inc. v. Westport Transit Dist., 235 Conn. 1, 664 A.2d 719, 729 (Conn. 1995). Thus, the § 35-27 claim must 
fall with the failure of CDC's federal claim. Id. "
208,11," The Court notes that there is also a substantial possibility that companies who market products for analysis of human blood 
could readily market those or similar devices to the veterinary market."
208,12," Similarly, CDC's other claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act fail. CDC's claim of ""leveraging"" (Count III) fails as CDC cannot 
prove any anticompetitive effect or monopoly power in the in-clinic hematology market. See Viacom Intern. Inc. v. Time. Inc., 785 
F.Supp 371, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). Likewise, CDC's ""essential facility"" claim fails. Even assuming that the distributor market 
satisfied the definition of a ""facility,"" CDC ""must show that an alternate to this facility is not economically feasible."" Twin 
Laboratories v. Weider Health and Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 568 (2d Cir. 1990)(citations  [**32] omitted) As previously noted, 
alternative channels are available and economically feasible for CDC. Moreover, CDC cannot show that ""'denial of its use inflicts 
a severe handicap on potential market entrants.'"" Twin Laboratories v. Weider Health and Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 568 (2d Cir. 
1990) (quoting Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 570 F.2d 982, 992, 187 U.S. App. D.C. 73 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Thus, there are no severe 
barriers to potential or current market participants."
208,13," While certain IDEXX documents, which indicate a desire to ""create barriers to entry"" and to ""KILL MASCOT,"" may raise a 
question as to the intent element of the monopoly claims, there is not sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact 
regarding the other elements of those claims. "
209,14," CDC does not allege and there is no evidence in the record that an actual contract existed between IDEXX and its distributors, 
but only a ""relationship."" (Compl ¶¶ 20-25.)"
209,15," The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 768 states: (1) One who intentionally causes a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with another who is his 
competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other's relation if (a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and (b) the actor does not employ wrongful means and (c) his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and (d) his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other."
209,16," Connecticut courts look to Massachusetts courts to interpret CUTPA claims because Massachusset's unfair trade practices act 
is virtually identical to CUTPA. See, e.g., Normand Josef Enterprises v. Connecticut National Bank, 230 Conn. 486, 646 A.2d 
1289, 1306 (Conn. 1994) (where the Connecticut Supreme Court noted that Connecticut has ""repeatedly looked to the 
reasoning and decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts with regard to the scope of CUTPA"") (citations and 
quotations omitted). "
214,1," On October 21, 1997, Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion arguing, inter alia, that a ruling on the motion should be deferred 
until discovery was complete. The Court granted Plaintiffs' request on November 19, 1997, and deferred a ruling on the motion 
until the close of factual discovery. On January 13, 1998, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental response, and on January 21, 1998 
Defendant filed a reply memorandum. Defendant supplemented the record on February 2, 1998 to reflect proof obtained during 
expert depositions. The motion was argued orally on February 13, 1998. Plaintiffs were allowed to supplement the record on 
March 2, 1998 and March 5, 1998. "
215,2," Brunswick has opposed Plaintiffs' definitions of the relevant markets throughout this case. The Complaint defines the relevant 
stern drive boat market as ""the market for recreational power boats, except luxury motor yachts, which are packaged with a stern 
drive or inboard marine engine and sold in the relevant geographic market."" See Complaint at P 37. The Complaint defines the 
outboard marine boat market as: The market for recreational power boats and fishing boats which are packaged with an outboard engine, or prerigged to 
take a particular brand of engine, and sold in the relevant geographic market. The outboard boat market consists of two 
segments or sub-markets, a freshwater segment and a saltwater segment. See Complaint at P 39. These markets are to be distinguished from the separate markets for outboard and stern drive engines 
sold apart from a boat or ""loose."" Plaintiffs have brought actual monopolization claims with respect to those alleged product 
markets."
215,3," It is undisputed that the geographic market in this case is the United States and Canada. Because of the nature of the available 
data, the estimates given by Romersa are slightly skewed. First, the estimate of Brunswick's retail sales is an estimate of 
worldwide sales. Thus, the numerator in the equation would be smaller if it were possible to determine Brunswick's retail sales 
solely in the United States and Canada. Second, the NMMA estimates only reflect sales by United States dealers. Thus, if it 
were possible to include sales by Canadian dealers, the denominator in the equation would be larger. In sum, according to "
216,," Romersa these estimates are the most accurate available, but the actual market shares would be smaller. See, Romersa Aff. at 
P 7.B. "
217,4," Plaintiffs' concern here (and willingness to concede that the NMMA records are business records) apparently stems from an 
ongoing dispute with Brunswick regarding other alleged business records, wherein Brunswick has refused to stipulate that 
certain documents are admissible as business records. The Court will in fact apply the law on Rule 803(6) even-handedly; 
however, each instance will have to be evaluated on its own merits."
217,5," Although Plaintiffs challenge the reliability of the NMMA statistics, they have offered no statistics reflecting market shares that 
are more reliable or that dispute the NMMA estimates. "
218,6," Plaintiffs argue that the following might be appropriate submarkets in this case: fiberglass boats, aluminum boats, bass boats, 
open express fish boats, utility boats, open deck boats (with or without pontoons), express cruisers, runabouts, performance I/O, 
stern drive cruisers, entry boats, mid-level boats, premium boats, entry cruiser stern drive boats, entry runabout outboards, mid-
level yachts, cruiser fiberglass boats, fiberglass outboard runabouts, fiberglass stern drive runabouts, fiberglass stern drive 
cruisers, and fiberglass center console outboard boats. The foregoing is only a partial list of the categories raised in Plaintiffs' 
pleadings. "
219,7," Even making liberal allowances for inaccuracies in the NMMA statistics as to the number of boats sold, Brunswick's market 
share is still so far removed from a permissible threshold that the outcome remains the same. "
228,1," We have in the excerpts of record Guardian's complaint against ITC filed in Michigan state court, and ITC's complaint against 
Guardian filed in Michigan federal court. We apparently do not have in the excerpts ITC's answer and counterclaims filed in 
Michigan state court. We have obtained the complete record and have been unable to find it there either. It is conceivable that it 
is in one place or the other, but the combination of poor indexing, lack of sequential page numbers, and discontinuous tab 
numbers in the excerpts, and excessive sealing of most items in the clerk's record, makes it a practical impossibility to assure 
that anything is, or is not, in the record. We therefore take ITC's allegations in the Michigan cases from the complaint it filed in 
Michigan federal court, without regard to what may or may not be in whatever answer and counterclaim might have been filed in 
the Michigan state court case. "
232,2," A federal district court has predicted that the Michigan Supreme Court would abandon the element of illegality, and rule that 
duress need not arise from an illegal act. See Kelsey-Hayes Co. v. Galtaco Redlaw Castings Corp., 749 F. Supp. 794, 797 n.5 
(E.D. Mich. 1990). We need not decide whether that court was correct, because ITC has alleged conduct on the part of Guardian 
that was both ""improper,"" under the Restatement rule, and ""illegal,"" per the Michigan cases."
232,3," The dates are somewhat confusing. The Michigan state court decree in the record does not show the filestamp, but ITC's 
pleading avers that it was entered August 13, 1991, and that is consistent with the rest of the record. The pleading is 
inconsistent regarding the date ITC was driven out of the Indonesia project. Paragraph 49 says Mulia sent a letter July 26, 1993 
firing ITC effective August 26, 1993. But paragraphs 42 through 48 describes ITC's firing by Mulia was part of a crisis that 
happened fast, in the summer of 1991. Paragraphs 50 through 54 describe events subsequent to Mulia's letter, leading up to the 
covenant not to sue in August 1991. These paragraphs aver that ITC's managing director flew to Indonesia to get its firing 
rescinded immediately after the consent decree was entered August 13, 1991, but on August 15 Guardian prevented ITC from 
showing the consent decree to the Indonesians, so ITC was terminated with finality. The context shows that the 1993 date in 
paragraph 49 was a typographical error. "
236,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by

237,1," ROT argues that it is a violation of the Sherman Act to attempt to use a patent on a container to establish a monopoly on the 
contents of the container. See Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488, 86 L. Ed. 363, 62 S. Ct. 402 (1942). "
247,1," In the first count, the plaintiff also seeks treble damages, attorneys fees, and costs, pursuant to General Statutes 35-35. "
254,1," According to the NCAA rules, a student-athlete is eligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics for a total of four seasons 
within a five-year period. Because Smith's five year-period of eligibility has expired and, according to the NCAA her complaint 
seeks only declaratory relief, the NCAA concludes that her Title IX claim is moot. We disagree. Smith's Title IX claim is not moot although her period of eligibility has expired because she retains a claim for damages. See Ellis 
Bhd. of Ry., Airline & S.S. Clerks, 466 U.S. 435, 442, 104 S. Ct. 1883, 1889, 80 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1984) (holding that HN1[
] a 
claim is not moot where there is a viable damages claim); National Iranian Oil Co. v. MAPCO Int'l, Inc., 983 F.2d 485, 489 (3d 
Cir. 1992); Jersey Cent. Power & Light Co. v. New Jersey, 772 F.2d 35, 41 (3d Cir. 1985). Although count II of Smith's 
complaint, which asserts a Title IX claim, states that ""this action is a request for a declaratory relief challenging sex 
discriminatory practices and policies of the NCAA . . . in violation of Title IX,"" her complaint also includes a clause which prays "
255,," for additional relief including damages and any further relief which the court finds appropriate. App. at 5. In our view, a fair 
reading of the complaint establishes that it asserts an action for damages under Title IX. See Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. 
Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992) (holding that a claim for damages exists in an action to enforce 
Title IX)."
255,2," The bylaw at issue provides that [a] student-athlete who is enrolled in a graduate or professional school of the institution he or she previously attended as an 
undergraduate (regardless of whether the individual has received a United States baccalaureate degree or its equivalent), a 
student-athlete who is enrolled and seeking a second baccalaureate or equivalent degree at the same institution, or a 
student-athlete who has graduated and is continuing as a full-time student at the same institution while taking course work 
that would lead to the equivalent of another major or degree as defined and documented by the institution, may participate 
in intercollegiate athletics, provided the student has eligibility remaining and such participation occurs within the applicable 
five-year or 10-semester period . . . . Rule 14.1.8.2 of NCAA Manual. "
256,3," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States . . . without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover 
threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
256,15, U.S.C. § 15. 
257,4," The recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Law v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 134 F.3d 1010, 
1998 WL 23710 (10th Cir. 1998), does not alter our result. At issue in Law was the NCAA's bylaw restricting entry-level coaches' 
annual compensation. The court held that although the restriction was a horizontal price restraint, which is usually per se invalid, 
the rule of reason applied because certain products, such as intercollegiate sports, require horizontal restraints in order to exist. 
See id. at * 5-* 6 (citing National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. at 100-01, 104 S. Ct. at 2959-60). The bylaw at issue in Law concerned a restriction on the business activities of the institutions, whereas the Postbaccalaureate 
Bylaw does not. Because our analysis regarding the applicability of the Sherman Act focuses on the distinction between 
commercial and noncommercial activities, Law is inapposite. Further, because of the significant difference in the nature of the 
bylaw at issue in Law and the Postbaccalaureate Bylaw, the Law court's rule of reason analysis is not instructive here. "
259,5," HN8[
] The statute defines ""program or activity"" as (2)(A) a college, university, or other postsecondary institution, or a public system of higher education; or . . . (4) any other entity which is established by two or more of the entities described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3); any part of 
which is extended Federal financial assistance . . . ."
259,20," U.S.C. § 1687. In addition, federal regulation in part provides that HN9[
] no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated 
differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or 
intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis."
259,34, C.F.R. § 106.41(a). 
260,6," The Rehabilitation Act states that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 706(8) of this title, shall, solely 
by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."
260,29, U.S.C. § 794 (emphasis added).
260,7," The Court noted that ""Congress enters into an arrangement in the nature of a contract with the recipients of the federal funds: 
the recipient's acceptance of the funds triggers coverage under the nondiscrimination provision."" 477 U.S. at 605, 106 S. Ct. at 
2711. The Court further noted that ""by limiting coverage to recipients, Congress imposes the obligations of § 504 upon those 
who are in a position to accept or reject those obligations as a part of the decision whether or not to 'receive' federal funds."" Id. 
at 606, 106 S. Ct. at 2711. "
261,8," However, Judge McKee would hold that Smith's original complaint sufficiently states that the NCAA receives federal financial 
assistance under the pleading requirements that we apply to pro se complaints. See Zilich v. Lucht, 981 F.2d 694 (3d Cir. 1992) 
HN10[
] (""When, as in this case, plaintiff is a pro se litigant, we have a special obligation to construe [her] complaint liberally.""). "
262,9," We do not imply that we have any view of the merits of Smith's Title IX claim. The parties have not briefed the merits, and the 
district court will address those issues on remand if Smith can prove her allegations to support the applicability of Title IX to the 
NCAA. Thus, we emphasize that we merely hold that the amendment would not have been futile in the sense that it would not 
have pled adequately that the NCAA was subject to Title IX. "
266,1," In response to Mitel's motion to dismiss A&A filed an amended complaint. Unless otherwise indicated, the above facts are 
derived from this amended version. "
267,2," It is unclear whether at the time of execution of the Distribution Agreement Mitel was aware of any relationship among A&A 
Connections, PCS, FTI and Franz Telecom Investments, Inc. "
270,3," FTI and FTI, Inc are two distinct entities. As evidenced by public corporate records attached to Mitel's opposition to 
intervention, FTI is a registered fictitious name under which A&A Connections does business and FTI, Inc. is a separate 
corporation. "
271,4," Additionally, Mitel argues that as a general rule federal courts should deny permission to intervene when, as in FTI, Inc.'s case, 
the intervenor seeks only to assert counterclaims. Mitel's position is based on Judge Bechtle's decision in Hubner v. 
Schoonmaker which concluded that Rule 24 was not designed to allow parties to interject affirmative interests into a lawsuit 
through counterclaims. Hubner v. Schoonmaker, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13035, 18 Fed. R. Serv. 3d (Callaghan) 741; 1990 WL 
149207 at *7 (E.D.Pa. 1990). In reaching this conclusion, Judge Bechtle relied on the following excerpt from chapter 24.17 of 
volume 3A of the second edition of Moore's Federal Practice: ""The desire of the petitioner to present a counterclaim or to add new parties may be one reason for denying intervention if 
the right to intervene is only discretionary. The fact that the intervenor's 'position is essentially aggressive' . . . may be one 
reason for denying intervention. The addition of new issues and new parties may be considered contrary to orderly 
procedure. . . . The court may properly deny or limit permissive intervention where it feels that the interposition of 
counterclaims not related to the matters at issue between the plaintiff and defendant would unduly delay or complicate the 
determination of those issues."" Id. (citing 3A Moore's Federal Practice, § 24.17 (Matthew Bender 1987). Though several other federal courts have also based denial of a motion to intervene on § 24.17, Moore's editors chose to omit 
the section from the third edition of Moore's Federal Practice which was published in 1997. See Medd v. Westcott, 32 F.R.D. 25 
(N.D.Iowa 1963); Beard-Laney v. Pressley, 18 F.R.D. 162 (W.D.S.C. 1955); Kauffman v. Kebert, 16 F.R.D. 225 (W.D.Pa. 1955); 
Vol.6 Moore's Federal Practice § 24.00 et. seq. (Matthew Bender 1997). Nevertheless, I find Judge Bechtle's decision sound and 
applicable. Mitel also argues that litigation between Mitel Far-East and PCS over termination of the Distribution Agreement is currently 
underway in Hong Kong, therefore, it is more appropriate for FTI, Inc. to seek intervention in that suit. Without evidentiary 
support of such litigation I refrain from passing on what if any impact such litigation would have on FTI, Inc.'s current motion. "
297,1," Following the filing of a combined petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing in banc, the panel has reconsidered and 
modified its decision in this case. Accordingly, the earlier-issued decision is hereby vacated and the opinion, reported at 129

297,2," The district court indicated that Branemark and af Ekenstam assigned the '891 patent to NP prior to NP's bringing this suit. 3I 
has not challenged NP's standing to bring this patent infringement claim without joining Branemark and af Ekenstam. "
299,3," NP suggests that it introduced the portions counter-designated ""as a matter of convenience and efficiency"" during its own case-
in-chief. At oral argument, NP also suggested that it introduced these portions ""as a courtesy"" to 3I. While such motives are 
commendable, they do not change the significance and meaning of this evidence. "

suppressed information that would otherwise have affected consumer behavior in the market for tobacco products, causing price 
inflation and increasing the demand for tobacco products. Compl. PP 238, 241. Creating increased demand for a product is not 
an anticompetitive activity. There can be no antitrust violation when the effect of an agreement is to increase competition, even if 
that agreement is unlawful for some other reason. Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488; see also McCready, 457 U.S. at 482. Plaintiffs 
also claim that defendants restrained research and withheld information from participants in the market for health care. Compl.

was not necessary for the Court to address the question of whether Premium is a separate corporate entity in ruling on the 
motions pending in this case."
346,2," In their Seventh and Eighth Claims for Relief, Defendants alleged that the Plaintiff had violated § 2 of the Robinson-Patman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, and § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. The Defendants have dismissed their Seventh and Eighth 
Claims for Relief, with prejudice. See Doc. # 81. "
348,3, The Defendants did not oppose the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike.
348,4," In Kennedy, the Ninth Circuit explained that the purpose of the rule set forth in Perma and followed by its progeny (which 
include the Sixth Circuit cases cited above) is to prevent a party from creating a sham fact question; when the inconsistency was 
the ""result of an honest discrepancy, a mistake, or the result of newly discovered evidence"" the purpose of the rule is not 
advanced by striking the affidavit. 952 F.2d at 266-67."
348,5," The transcript of Segner's deposition consists of two volumes. The Court uses ""I"" to signify the first volume and ""II"" to signify 
the second. "
349,6," Segner testified that he or one of two other employees of L.A. Pet, Roman Versch and John Helt, had to approve discounts. I

351,7," These four claims are state law claims. In their memoranda, the Plaintiff and the Defendants rely on the substantive law of 
Ohio. Indeed, § 13 of the Distributorship Agreements provided that they would be governed by the law of that state. Therefore, in 
ruling on the Plaintiffs' First and Second Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, the Court relied upon the substantive law of 
Ohio."
351,8," In its letter to Defendants, dated August 13, 1993, Plaintiff stated that it terminating the agreements, because of the fact that 
L.A. Pet had filed the lawsuit."
351,9," The Defendants caption their Fourth Claim for Relief as one for breach of contract/interference with contracts. In their 
Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's First Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 74), the Defendants disclaimed any 
intention of relying upon a tortious interference theory. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the Court to address the arguments 
raised by the Plaintiff that it was entitled to summary judgment on the Defendants' Fourth Claim for Relief, to the extent that it 
was predicated upon such a theory. "
352,10," This release language excepts any claims Plaintiff may have against the distributor for goods or services it had provided to the 
distributor. "
353,11," The first of these limitations arises out of Plaintiff's decision, made in 1992, to sell its products directly to certain customers, 
such as PetsMart. As a result, independent distributors, such as L.A. Pet, have sold only ""fill-in products"" to PetsMart, since that 
date. Under that program, Plaintiff would sell pet food directly to PetsMart, without using its distributors. Plaintiff would deliver the 
pet food to a central location, and PetsMart would distribute it to its stores. When a particular PetsMart store needed additional 
pet food on an immediate basis (i.e., ""fill-in products""), Plaintiff would purchase the product from one of its distributors, such as 
L.A. Pet, who would, in turn, deliver it to the PetsMart store in need of same. Plaintiff would then be billed for that product by the 
distributor. The second such limitation is the ""ABC"" lists. The Plaintiff used an ""ABC"" list in order to track customers of its 
distributors so that each customer was serviced. An ""A"" customer of a particular distributor purchased more products from that 
distributor than from any other distributor. The third such alleged limitation arises out of Plaintiff's marketing strategy. That 
strategy, which is fully detailed in the affidavit of Martin Walker, was to have Plaintiff's products sold only in pet stores, veterinary 
clinics, lawn and garden stores and upscale grocery stores."
353,12," In reality, Domhoff & Joyce entered into the contract with an entity which assigned its rights to Indianapolis; however, since 
Domhoff & Joyce had agreed to the assignment, the Hamilton County Court of Appeals treated Indianapolis as if it had been a 
contracting party. See 69 Ohio App. at 110-11."
353,13," An accord and satisfaction is an affirmative defense to a claim for money damages when there is a bona fide dispute over an 
unliquidated demand. Allen v. R.G. Indus. Supply, 66 Ohio St. 3d 229, 611 N.E.2d 794 (1993). "
356,14," The Defendants would have been required to purchase the pet food from the Plaintiff for it to be part of their inventory. 
Therefore, by requiring the Defendants to maintain a minimum level of inventory, the Plaintiff was requiring the Defendants to 
increase their costs."
356,15," In their Fourth Claim for Relief, the Defendants had also alleged that the Plaintiff had tortiously interfered with contracts; 
however, the Defendants have abandoned that allegation. See Footnote 9, supra. "
359,16," Since the Court had concluded that there was no evidence that the Plaintiff had engaged in concerted activity, it was not 
necessary to address Plaintiff's alternative argument, that the restraints in which it is alleged to have engaged were non-price, 
vertical restraints which are assessed under the ""rule of reason"" and that those restraints are, as a matter of law, reasonable. "
360,17," The Plaintiff has also filed a motion requesting that this Court expedite disposition of its (Plaintiff's) Motion for Final Judgment 
(Doc. # 91). See Doc. # 99. Given that the Court rules, herein, upon the Plaintiff's request for entry of final judgment, the Court 
overrules, as moot, Plaintiff's Motion to Expedite Disposition (Doc. # 99)."
360,18, This is the litigation that caused Plaintiff to terminate the agreements between the parties.
360,19," In their Seventh and Eighth Claims for Relief, Defendants alleged that the Plaintiff had violated § 2 of the Robinson-Patman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, and § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. The Defendants have dismissed their Seventh and Eighth 
Claims for Relief, with prejudice. See Doc. # 81. "
362,20," The Plaintiff has filed a motion with which it requests that the Court enjoin the California Superior Court from proceeding with 
the litigation between the parties currently pending before it. See Doc. # 102. Although this Court has no doubt of its authority to 
enter such injunctive relief (see 28 U.S.C. § 2283), it chooses not to exercise that authority at this time. Rather, the California "
363,," Superior Court should, in the first instance, determine the preclusive effect of this Decision. Accordingly, the Court overrules the 
Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Retraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (Doc. # 102), without prejudice to renewal on an 
immediate basis, should events in the California litigation convince Plaintiff that renewal is an idea whose time has come. In addition, this Court has not entered final judgment on the Defendants' Third Claim for Relief, with which they had alleged that 
Plaintiff had breached the Distributorship Agreements by terminating those agreements, although the Court has granted Plaintiff 
summary judgment on that claim. Based upon a review of the complaint filed by L.A. Pet in the California action (which has been 
furnished this Court), it appears that a similar claim is not being pursued in that litigation. Indeed, that lawsuit was filed before 
those agreements were terminated. In the event that an amended complaint is or has been filed in that litigation, setting forth a 
claim similar to the Defendants' Third Claim for Relief, the Plaintiff is directed to renew its request for injunctive relief, on an 
immediate basis. The Court, in turn, will grant a temporary restraining order, leading to a hearing on a request for preliminary 
injunction, in order to protect and/or to effectuate its judgment with regard to the grant of summary judgment to the Plaintiff on 
that Third Claim for Relief of the Defendants. 28 U.S.C. § 2283. "
373,1," This case is consolidated. Because Fields and Hennessy were co-plaintiffs of Gary Smith in Case No. 93-CV-40521 against 
LCE, this Report and Recommendation refers to LCE as the defendant. Plaintiffs' claims were initially brought against three 
defendants, LCE, Blue Line Distributing, Inc., and Little Caesar National Advertising Program, Inc. (""LCNAP""). This Court has 
granted summary judgment on all claims involving LCNAP. After this suit was filed, LCE merged with Blue Line. Thus, LCE is the 
sole remaining defendant. "
375,2," If a franchisor has a legitimate business justification for denying a franchisee's request for an alternate distributor, the mere fact 
that the franchisor may also have a secondary desire not to face competition does not involve a violation of the antitrust laws. In 
other words, if the defendant can demonstrate that they would have denied the request for an alternate distributor even in the 
absence of the fact that this would reduce the competition they would face, the denial would be justified and no antitrust law 
violated. Obviously a jury could determine either (1) that the business justification was a pretext, or alternatively (2) the business 
justification, while of some degree of legitimacy, would not have been sufficient to warrant the denial in the absence of the 
defendant's desire to restrain competition. Cf. Mount Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 50 L. Ed. 2d 
471, 97 S. Ct. 568 (1977) (in a constitutional context, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case that the defendant's 
action was taken against him in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right, the burden shifts to the defendant to show by 
a preponderance that he would have taken the same action even if the plaintiff had not engaged in the constitutionally protected 
action.) While this is not the central issue of this motion, and I am unaware of any specific antitrust case law on this precise 
point, the policy considerations lying behind the Mount Healthy case are consistent with and applicable to the policy 
considerations in antitrust law in precluding a franchisor from using otherwise legitimate reasons for denying an alternate 
distributor as a cover for a denial that is actually motivated by a desire to restrain competition. Courts in the constitutional context 
have made it clear that an act in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 
1983 even if the act, when taken for different reasons, would have been proper.  Franco v. Kelly, 854 F.2d 584, 590 (2d Cir. 
1988); Howland v. Kilquist, 833 F.2d 639, 644 (7th Cir. 1987); Wright v. Newsome, 795 F.2d 964, 968 (11th Cir. 1986) (per 
curiam). Similar analysis has been made in the antitrust context. See Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110, "
376,119," , 92 L. Ed. 1245, 68 S. Ct. 947 (1948) (""Even an other otherwise lawful device may be used as a weapon in restraint of trade 
or in an effort to monopolize a part of trade or commerce."") "
378,3," The court also rejected the fact that several promoters would have used SEATS regardless, noting that the tying arrangement prevented them from making that choice freely. We reiterate that the principal evil of tie-ins is that they 
foreclose competition on the merits in the tied market. Id. at 1417, "
379,4," This SCM case also found a tie-in between the paper and the rental agreements of the SCM photocopying machines. While 
there was no express tie, the rental agreements acknowledge that ""supplies which may cause damage or deterioration will not 
be used in the machines."" 415 F.2d at 63. The lower court found a pattern of conduct by the SCM representatives ""to threaten 
the cancellation of rental agreements with customers who used competitive supplies in their SCM machines[,]"" and SCM 
representatives specifically misinformed customers that ""the use of Nashua supplies would cause service calls and interrupt the 
continuous operation of their SCM machines[,]"" and defendants did this to induce rental customers to stop dealing with the 
plaintiff who sold Nashua paper.  Id. at 63 and 64. The contract noted ""SCM reserves the right to suspend this agreement as to 
any machines in which other suppliers' paper or other supplies have been used."" Id. at 65. This has later been referred to as the 
""tying by lying"" theory. In SCM, the misstatement of fact about Nashua paper coupled with the threat that the machines could break down and the 
service contracts could be voided induced people to purchase SCM paper, and thus this was causally linked to the 
establishment of the tie-in. In the present case, if, as plaintiffs assert, defendant's contractual agreement to approve alternate 
distributors was a misrepresentation, this representation that they would approve alternate sources did not ""cause"" any tie-in of 
the use of Blue Line. In SCM, the buyers relying on the representation of the defendant would be induced to buy the defendant's 
paper. In the present case, any franchisee relying on the representation of the defendant would be induced to believing they 
could seek an alternate source of goods other than Blue Line. Thus, even if plaintiffs are correct in their contention that the 
second source provision of the franchise agreement was a ""charade,"" this does not result in ""tying by lying"" because relying on 
this representation did not cause the tie. At most, relying on this representation may have caused the franchisee to sign a 
franchise agreement and become locked in. This lock-in issue, however, may possibly relate to market power but this 
misrepresentation does not directly implicate the question of whether there is a tie. In the present case, if there is a tie because 
the second source provision of the contract is a charade, the tie is not caused by the second source provision in the Franchise 
Agreement and representation by the defendant, but rather by the defendant's allegedly wrongful refusal to honor it."
379,5," In the Photovest case, for a period prior to the June 1971 Chicken Delight case, 12 of the 16 franchisees had signed 
agreements that required them to buy processing from Fotomat. Thus, there was an express tie in the tying contract. Four of the 
Photovest franchisees did not have such restrictive language in their contract but rather were permitted to obtain processing 
from Fotomat-approved sources. The Seventh Circuit ruled against the plaintiff with respect to these franchisees because 
plaintiff never attempted to exercise their contract rights and thus could not prove wrongful refusals to constitute a de facto tie-in. "
381,6," In the present case, there is really only one contested denial during the limitations period, that of AmeriServ. "
383,7," At the October 16, 1997, hearing on this motion, Collins v. International Dairy Queen, Inc., 168 F.R.D. 668 (M.D.Ga. 1996), was 
discussed. It was noted that in Collins the franchisees' association, DQOC, had sought to act as a buying cooperative and in 
other ways act on behalf of the Dairy Queen franchisees. While it was not earlier asserted, plaintiffs' counsel in a November 5, 
1997, letter brief to the Court noted that ""The facts underlying this case are similar [to Collins] in that plaintiff Smith also 
attempted to obtain alternate distributors on behalf of a franchisee cooperative, the A.L.C.F."" (An Association for the Little 
Caesar Franchisee.) Unlike DQOC, it is not clear that A.L.C.F. is organized as a purchasing cooperative. Plaintiffs' counsel then 
asserts that a June 5, 1992, response from LCE's Vice Chairman Charles Jones to Gary Smith noted that Smith's request was 
written on A.L.C.F. stationary, but stated he ""assumed that you were writing that letter in your capacity as a Little Caesar 
franchisee."" This letter and other documents concerning Gary Smith's efforts to get AmeriServ approved as an alternate 
distributor are set out in the March 1998 Summary Judgment Report at and around p. 78. Plaintiffs' counsel claims that this 
indicates that ""defendants flatly refused to recognize franchisees' efforts to purchase goods through a cooperative."" Lockridge 
November 5, 1997, Letter the Court. Defense counsel responds that plaintiffs ""now for the first time relies on a 1992 letter to 
establish a co-op request for a new distributor."" Sussman November 7, 1997, Letter to the Court. Plaintiffs are a little late in claiming that Gary Smith was acting on behalf of A.L.C.F. or all members of A.L.C.F. including Fields 
and Hennessy. It is also surprising that if A.L.C.F. was making the request that plaintiffs would not have some better proofs of 
Gary Smith's agency than the June 5, 1992, letter from LCE's Vice Chairman Charles Jones -- possibly a declaration or affidavit, 
or a notation of an A.L.C.F. meeting. While AmeriServ made a presentation to all A.L.C.F. members at their convention in early 
1993, this is consistent with the application for AmeriServ to be an alternative distributor being from Gary Smith representing his 
franchises only. It is also noteworthy that AmeriServ's memo notes that ""until someone in the organizations take[s] a stand for 
their contract rights against the corporation, we will not be able to purchase/stock logo products."" Turnbull October 16, 1995, 
Declaration, Ex. 19, noted in the March 1998 Summary Judgment Report at 79. This new assertion that Gary Smith was seeking 
approval of AmeriServ in his capacity as President of A.L.C.F. was not even listed among the new evidence"" that plaintiffs' 
counsel asserts warrants a reconsideration of this Courts denial of the tying claims of Fields and Hennessy. Nor is the 
association a plaintiff in this litigation. "
389,1," This case is consolidated. Because the class certified by this Court involves an antitrust claim (case No. 93-CV-40521) by class 
representative Gary Smith against LCE, this Report and Recommendation refers to the class members as plaintiffs and LCE as 
defendant. Gary Smith's claim was initially brought against three defendants, LCE, Blue Line Distributing, Inc. (""Blue Line""), and 
Little Caesar National Advertising Program, Inc. (""LCNAP""). This Court has granted summary judgment on all claims involving 
LCNAP. After this suit was filed, LCE merged with Blue Line. Thus, LCE is the sole remaining defendant. Case No. 93-CV-
40521 was filed by Gary Smith along with two other franchisees, John Hennessy and Sharon Fields. This Court has granted 
summary judgment against Hennessy and Fields, although they have filed a motion for reconsideration of that ruling and an 
expanded class of plaintiffs. Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. v. Smith, 895 F. Supp. 884, 894-898 (E.D.Mich. 1995). "
390,2," In September 1989, Blue Line had warehouses serving eight regions of the United States. By December 1992, it operated 
warehouses serving Little Caesar franchises in 16 regions covering most of the United States."
390,3," The term ""Franchise Agreement"" or ""mid-1990-Franchise Agreement"" as used throughout this Report refers to the August 1990 
form franchise agreement as distinguished from the ""pre-mid-1990 Franchise Agreement"" or the 1995 Franchise Agreement."
390,4," All of the agreements before and after 1990 also precluded a request for an alternate source of signage, which practice, like the 
proprietary spice and dough mixes, is not challenged in this litigation. "
391,5," In the present case, plaintiffs have not specifically alleged that Blue Line is charging ""supracompetitive prices"" on the logoed 
goods, but rather on the blended profit margins on the entire market basket of goods Blue Line sells. Defense counsel at a 
hearing on a related motion asserted, without challenge from plaintiffs, that plaintiffs are not charging, and could not prove that 
Blue Line is charging, above market prices for the logoed goods."
391,6," In 1990, the carryout franchises contract term was for 10 years with an option to renew under the then current franchise 
agreement terms. The term of earlier franchise agreements that would need reviewing in the 1990's is not identified in the 
record. "
392,7," In reaching its decision denying certification of a class that included the pre-mid-1990 franchisees, the Court left open the 
question of whether there might be a ""basis for certification of a national class action [involving] the franchise agreements signed 
after mid-1990 [that] prevent franchisees from requesting an alternate distributor of logoed products."" Id. at 905. The Court 
noted: ""It could be argued that the post mid-1990 agreements, combined with the 1989 exclusive licensing agreement, evidence 
an express contractual tie-in of logoed products which could receive class treatment."" Thus, the Court did not grant summary 
judgment on the tie-in claim involving the mid-1990 Franchise Agreements. It was this class the Court later certified in its March 
31, 1997, order. 172 F.R.D. at 239 and 268."
392,8," Defendant's Brief Supporting its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 6-7 asserts that ""the relevant market for a tie-in claim 
on logo products and on other products used by a pizza chain's franchisees is the 'pre contract' market for the sale of franchises 
for either take out pizza franchises, fast food franchises or restaurant franchises in general."" "
393,9," Of the pizza chains listed in the top 100 fast food chains, LCE has a market share below 20%. Def. Motion Ex. 2-3. Because of 
the many smaller carryout pizza outlets, LCE's market share of all pizza outlets would be smaller. LCE's market share of the top 
100 fast food chains (including pizza and other carryout foods) is approximately 3.4%. Id."
393,10," Jefferson Parish Hospital v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984), found HN1[
] a 30% market share 
insufficient to show significant market power in the tying product market that is needed to invoke the per se rule against tying. In 
light of Jefferson Parish, LCE concludes that plaintiffs have failed to show that LCE has enough market power in a market of all 
fast food franchises or of pizza franchises to invoke the per se rule on tying. The plaintiffs' claim of a per se tie-in violation 
requires the tying market to be defined as the single-brand Little Caesar carryout franchises, as they and their economic experts 
have alleged it to be. While market power can be shown by factors other than market share -- such as a unique product 
protected by a patent, copyright or trademark -- plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence that LCE has significant 
market power derived solely from its trademark or copyrighted products bearing its trademark, logo and other distinctive marks.  
Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1346-47 (9th Cir. 1987); A.I. Root co. v. Computer 
Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673, 676 (6th Cir. 1986). X AREEDA, HOVENKAMP AND ELHAUGE, ANTITRUST LAW (1990) at 95-
96, P 1737, specifically cites A.I. Root as rejecting the earlier case law that inferred market power from copyright or trademark 
protection. See also Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 480 n. 15 (3d Cir. 1992) (en 
banc) (""The plaintiffs do cite several old cases that viewed trademarks as creating presumptions of market power. But modern 
courts and commentators reject this position.""). "
394,11," Stephen Siwek and Philip Nelson note that an economic commodity that can be bought or sold can define a market. Siwek 
and Nelson December 1997 Declaration. They add that the franchise rights created by Little Caesar franchise agreements is an 
""economic commodity"" and can be traded in markets. They assert that during the period 1993-1995 LCE repurchased 241 Little 
Caesar franchises, and third parties purchased 597 Little Caesar franchises (Little Caesar March 29, 1996, Franchise Offering 
Circular). Id. at 3-4, P 10. Thus, the authors conclude that there is ""a distinguishable antitrust market for the right to operate as a 
Little Caesar[] franchisee."""
394,12," The Fourth Circuit in Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 970, 68 L. Ed. 2d 349, 
101 S. Ct. 2047 (1981), took a different position with respect to franchising. It noted that when the tied items were integral 
components of the franchised business -- such as carefully selected outlet locations and unique design associated with the 
trademark -- there could not be a tie-in. The Sixth Circuit has never cited the Principe case in defining separate products, nor did 
the Supreme Court in considering the question of defining one versus two products in its Jefferson Parish case, 466 U.S. at 23 
n.35. "
395,13," An economic expert at the trial contended that absent the restrictive policies of Honeywell, ""PSI's market share [for repairing 
Honeywell control equipment] should be as high as twenty-seven percent."" Id. 104 F.3d at 814. "
396,14," While none of these three distributors has entered the market, they were permitted to distribute products needed to operate a 
Little Caesar franchise except for special proprietary dough and spice mixes."
396,15," This was in and before 1989, a time prior to Blue Line's 1990 merger into its parent corporation LCE. While Blue Line at the 
time was a subsidiary of LCE, the significant point is that some franchisees obtained their rights to operate a LCE franchise 
under the LCE trademark from one firm and obtained their food products and their logoed products from two separate firms. 
While Blue Line was the firm selling the logoed products, from an economic and antitrust point of view, it could have been a firm 
unrelated to LCE that was allowed to sell LCE's copyright and trademark protected products."
396,16," While plaintiffs' counsel, at a hearing on a more recent motion, asserted that they also challenge the defendant's actions under 
the rule of reason doctrine, this has not been briefed or argued in this motion. It has been my assumption in both of my earlier 
Reports and Recommendations on class certification and in this Report, that plaintiffs' challenge to defendant's conduct is under 
the per se tie-in doctrine. The cases cited and analyzed are per se tie-in cases, and this Report and Recommendation considers 
the sufficiency of market power in the tying product that is needed to make out a prima facie element of a per se tie-in claim. PSI 
states that the per se rule and rule of reason analysis have, in effect, merged in recent years. Under traditional per se analysis, restraints of trade were condemned without any 
inquiry into the market power possessed by the defendant. See, e.g., Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 
5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). However, HN5[
] under tying's per se rule, the seller must possess 
substantial market power in the tying product market. In addition, tying's per se rule provides for an inquiry into whether the 
defendant's conduct has procompetitive effects. See Kodak, 504 U.S. at 478-79, 112 S. Ct. at 2088-89. Such an extensive 
factual inquiry is hardly the stuff of per se analysis. Under rule-of-reason analysis, the antitrust plaintiff must show, inter alia, 
an adverse effect on competition. See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29-30, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 
1567-68, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). This circuit adopted the following HN6[
] three-step analysis for determining whether a 
tying arrangement is likely to cause such an anticompetitive effect: ""(1) the seller must have power in the tying product 
market; (2) there must be a substantial threat that the tying seller will acquire market power in the tied-product market; and 
(3) there must be a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied products as distinct."" Hand v. Central Transp., "
397,," Inc., 779 F.2d 8, 11 (6th Cir. 1985). Thus, in this circuit, HN7[
] market power in the tying product market is an 
indispensable requirement under either per se or rule-of-reason analysis. As Professors Areeda, Elhauge, and Hovenkamp 
comment, ""the per se rule against tying is 'per se' in only one respect--namely, dispensing with proof of anticompetitive 
effects. . . ."" 10 PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW P 1760e, at 372 (1996). The merger of these two theories 
is apparent in the majority in Kodak, which does not even mention the terms ""per se"" or ""rule of reason,"" even though 
Kodak was technically a per se case."
397,104," F.3d at 815. This statement, which was not the matter at issue in PSI, is not my understanding of the relation of rule of reason analysis to per 
se tying analysis, nor does the section cited from Kodak support this PSI statement. While current case law and substantial 
academic literature tout the procompetitive effects on certain tying arrangements, the analysis of actual harm to competition and 
the balancing process is not part of a per se tying case unless after plaintiff has made out the elements of the prima facie per se 
claim the defendant then wishes to assert a procompetitive justification for the tying arrangement to rebut the per se presumption 
of harm to the market. Thus, a defendant can raise an affirmative defense of procompetitive effects of the tie which then triggers 
the balancing test and a review of alternative means available to defendant that fulfill the procompetitive aspect with lesser harm 
to competition. See, e.g., United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545, 560 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 567, 
81 S. Ct. 755, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1961) (per curiam). See also Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 25 n. 42 (where it classified alleged 
procompetitive effects by a defendant as a ""goodwill"" defense that is routinely rejected by a court's finding that less restrictive 
""contractual quality specifications"" can protect a company's goodwill with less harm to competition than a tie-in). In the present case, defendant is not in this motion asserting any procompetitive effects of its behavior. It is merely asserting that 
plaintiffs cannot prove market power in the tying product that is needed for them to invoke the per se anti-tying shortcut. While 
plaintiffs in the present case could attack an anticompetitive tie-in directly under the rule of reason by asserting that LCE's 
conduct has harmed competition in the market for foods and/or supplies sold to restaurants, this is not their claim. Rather, they 
are asserting a per se tying violation, and LCE is claiming they cannot prove an essential prima facie element of such a claim. 
Accord, Digital Equip. Corp. v. Uniq Digital Technologies, 73 F.3d 756, 760 (7th Cir. 1996) (Easterbrook, J.). Even if I am wrong on this analysis of when and whether the rule of reason balancing enters the per se tying picture, PSI notes 
that ""in this circuit, market power in the tying product market is an indispensable requirement under either per se or rule-of-
reason analysis."" 104 F.3d at 815. Thus, a showing of no market power in the present case would defeat either claim. The Areeda authors disagree with this position. They argue that even where a plaintiff cannot show market power in the tying 
product by large market share, an antitrust challenge can be made under the rule of reason test where substantial harm to 
competition can be shown in the tied product market. X AREEDA, ET AL., at 45, P 1734b4. "
398,17," As noted in that Report, in the absence of express tie-in language in the franchise agreement there had to be proof of some 
""forcing"" or ""coercion"" to take Product B in order to obtain Product A. This ""coercion"" or ""forcing"" is a necessary element of 
proving two products are tied when the tie-in is not clearly expressed in the contract or admitted by the defendant. While this 
""coercion"" element to prove the existence of a tie (prima facie element # 1) relates to a defendant's power, it is different (albeit 
overlapping to some extent) from the consideration of power in prima facie element # 2-- does defendant have significant market 
power in the tying market to restrain appreciably competition in the tied product market. This distinction is more clearly illustrated in the example used by Justice Black in Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 7, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958): If one . . . food store[] in a community were to refuse to sell flour unless the buyer also took sugar it would hardly tend to 
restrain competition in sugar if its competitors were ready and able to sell flour by itself. Assume the single food store that only sold flour [Product A] if the buyer took sugar [Product B] refused to admit this practice 
and used no written contracts with an express tie. Instead its cashiers used salesmanship, even overbearing tactics and threats 
to remove the sugar from the goods sold if the customer wanting flour did not also buy a bag of sugar. These sales practices 
would be evidence of ""forcing"" or ""coercion"" relevant to prima facie element # 1 on whether there is a tying arrangement. In such a case, the proofs related to the ""coercion"" on prima facie element # 1 (are the two products tied in fact) are clearly 
separate from the proofs needed to show the seller had substantial market power in the market for Product A (prima facie 
element # 2). The former would involve what the cashiers said and did, and the latter would involve proofs of market share in the 
sale of flour. Yet, the proofs on the separate elements are related because the effectiveness of the salesman tying the sale of 
sugar to flour is dependent on the degree of the seller's power in the market for flour. If the customer can obtain flour or a 
satisfactory substitute from another grocer, the customer is free to buy sugar elsewhere or not at all. While the tying store can 
continue to insist (and ""force"") the sale of sugar when a customer wants to buy flour, antitrust law is unconcerned because 
consumer choice and competition are not seriously harmed. The reason is that there is no proof of prima facie element # 2 on 
market power."

Marshall, in the majority in Fortner I, joined the majority of Fortner II which was unanimous on its treatment of market power in 
the tying market."
399,21," Justice White in his Fortner I dissent determined first that there was nothing ""unique"" about the money U.S. Steel was lending 
other than its ""low cost"" which is ""ordinarily no reflection of market power."" Id. at 515. He added that if the great credit deal was 
not available from any source other than U.S. Steel, then Steel's competitors in the prefabricated house market lost no possible 
sales in the ""tied market"" because the potential buyer/developers who needed such otherwise unavailable credit to build these 
houses could not buy prefabricated houses from a competitor of U.S. Steel. "
400,22," This suggests that before market power can be inferred from a number of customers accepting ""burdensome"" terms, a court 
must evaluate whether the terms of the tie really are ""burdensome."" One would need to know whether the quality-adjusted 
package price exceeds rival prices for the two products. One of the LCE claims argued in this motion that this Court need not 
address involves this issue of whether plaintiffs must prove that the total package is priced above market. (See Defendant's brief 
at 11-12.)"

Press, Inc. v. Omni Promotions Co. of GA., 815 F.2d 1407, 1420 (11th Cir. 1987). Most of the cases involving proof of market 
power by methods other than a high share of the relevant tying market were before 1977 when Fortner II turned a more critical 
eye on assertions of substantial market power in the absence of substantial market share."

coerce customers to take an unwanted product from him nor significantly impair competition in the tied market."" 466 U.S. at 11-
13. The Areeda authors use an example of ""suppose that all franchisors require their franchisees to take certain supplies from 
the franchisor. If none of them has the requisite power individually, the per se rule would be inapplicable. Nor would the 
restraints be unreasonable when the aggregate foreclosures were but a minor share of the tied market."" AREEDA, ET AL., at 40,

burden on the plaintiff to show not only a substantial number of customers accepted the tie, but their doing so could only be 
explained in terms of the defendants having market power."
401,27," As noted by Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion in Jefferson Parish, even a patent does not make a product unique for 
purposes of determining market power if the relevant market contains reasonable substitute products to which a consumer can 
turn if the price of the patented item goes up significantly. 466 U.S. at 39-40."
401,28," Jefferson Parish suggests that this is not always the case because by tying B to A the seller may camouflage the true price of 
each product. The Court notes that a seller might increase ""monopoly profits over what they would be absent the tie"" either by 
price discrimination (against the less informed consumer) or ""perhaps by [the buyer's] inability to evaluate the true cost of either 
product when they are available only as a package."" See also 466 U.S. at 15 and n.24. "
402,29," Fortner II also noted that most sellers have the ability to raise prices and not lose particularly loyal customers, but this limited 
""power"" does not trigger the per se tying rule. 429 U.S. at 621 n.14. "

406,32," The Areeda treatise notes that in considering a known policy of not making unique parts available to independent repairs, the Kodak dissent urged that me relevant tying product would be the machine if Kodak's policy of not selling repair parts to 
independent service organizations were generally known to machine buyers. The majority apparently agreed when it 
emphasized the absence of evidence that Kodak's policy was generally known. AREEDA at 150, P 1740 (footnotes omitted). "
407,33," As I note later, there may be in this case a disputed issue of material fact whether the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement 
disclosed enough for a reasonable potential consumer of LCE franchises to know (what the evidence suggests LCE knew) that 
(1) if many mid-1990 franchisees expose themselves to an LCE/Blue Line tie-in of logoed goods which was ""generally known"" or 
for most franchise shoppers fairly obvious from the language in the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement and other readily available 
facts); and (2) if LCE refused to sell logoed paper goods to alternative distributors, then (3) this would raise entry barriers and 
the ability to compete for alternative distributors because of many franchisees' preference for one stop shopping and the fact that 
logoed goods had higher profit margins than the other items in the ""market basket"" of products needed to operate a LCE 
franchise. This latter impact on potential alternate distributors' ability to enter the market and compete with Blue Line is not ""so 
obvious"" that this Court could, on this record, determine that it was ""generally known"" for purposes of granting partial summary 
judgment."
407,34," Professor Grimes argues: The cases suggest the need to adopt a test for tie-ins that accounts for market imperfections. Making market power the 
exclusive key to anticompetitive injury pressures the courts to define the market narrowly to adjust for market imperfections 
that are present in tie-ins. A case such as Kodak presents the issue of a harmful tie because of market imperfections, not 
because of any fundamental structural problem with the micrographic industry. If the Court stretches market definitions to 
allow for these imperfections, market definitions are distorted. For example, when the Court defines the market to include 
only Kodak spare parts, this definition would have possible ramifications for merger analysis under Section 7 of the Clayton 
Act or for monopolization suits under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Yet the structural remedies often used in merger or 
monopolization suits are surely inappropriate in a case like Kodak. Courts can reconcile this tension by simply decreeing that separate standards govern market definitions in tie-in cases. But 
such a declaration is likely to lead to more confusion on an issue that is already one of the most conceptually difficult courts 
face in antitrust litigation. If, instead, there is forthright recognition that market shares are not dispositive when the harm 
from a tie arises from market imperfections, much of the pressure to distort market definitions is reduced. Market definitions 
will still be critical in determining whether a tie is associated with cartel behavior or likely to raise competitors' costs. But in 
testing for such injury, there would appear to be no reason to define the tying product market any differently than would be 
done in a merger or monopoly case. "
408,, Id. at 316-17 (footnote omitted).
408,35," The author notes that the ability of a buyer to negotiate with the seller for contractual protections before purchasing a tying 
product may not be an adequate pre-contract safeguard if market imperfections affect the buyer's motivation. ""The real issue is 
not whether corrective mechanisms exist for knowledgeable buyers but how quickly and how pervasively knowledge of the 
unfavorable terms of the seller's tie will permeate the market."" Id. at 175 n.44. While consumer information pervades real world markets, that does not mean that certain information costs should not lead to 
antitrust remedies when they are exploited by sellers. The proper distinction here is that, as a policy matter, the law should address active and intentional behavior that creates 
new consumer injury even if a similar injury created by a seller's passive reliance on market imperfections is beyond the 
law. Like deceptive advertising or securities fraud, a seller's use of a harmful tie is voluntary and intentional behavior and it 
results in additional harm that would not occur if the seller were passively benefiting from market imperfections. Id. at 280."
408,36," As noted above, the Sixth Circuit found that notwithstanding Honeywell's denials, it was providing service as a separate 
product from its parts even though it immediately replaced a customer's defective control panel with a replacement panel. While 
it did not ""service"" all control panels, customers had to return the defective control panels. Honeywell then examined the 
returned defective panels and repaired many of them. These ""serviced"" control panel were placed in the inventory of control 
panels used to replace defective ones for their customers. "
409,37," In Kodak, any buyer of the equipment without an extended warranty or a service contract with fixed prices could, on a 
moment's reflection, realize that the manufacturer had the power to raise replacement parts to above-market prices or condition 
their availability on purchasing above-market price service from Kodak. The majority, however, did not use this ""could have 
known"" information about the risk to bar the potential availability of a narrowed tying market definition. Assuming our inferences noted above about Justice Blackmun's footnote 24 response to Justice Scalia are correct, then the 
majority would have denied the narrowed tying market definition if this policy were announced or generally known. The narrowed 
market definition is not necessarily foreclosed if the risk is ""knowable"" but not obvious or generally known. The majority may 
have left this potential availability of a narrowed tying market definition because the general economic assumption is that a 
manufacturer's concerns about its reputation in the foremarket and its desire for future equipment sales would prevent its 
aftermarket opportunism. Thus, not only was its change of policy not ""obvious,"" it ordinarily would not be anticipated because of 
its potential for harm to Kodak's reputation in the equipment market."
409,38," The use of ""generally known"" in Kodak and PSI suggests that a narrowed tying product market definition would not be 
available if a sufficient number of reasonable customers knew enough pre-contract to be ""sophisticated"" and thereby ""police"" the 
market in some manner for the less sophisticated. Thus, the unsophisticated customer will not have an antitrust claim using a 
Kodak market definition if competitive forces in the market are maintained through what is known by a sufficient number of 
sophisticated customers. This situation might be different if the seller can identify the informed/sophisticated customers and 
discriminate in their favor by lower prices or exclusion from the tying arrangement. Yet, where the market operates with 
reasonable effectiveness and the informed consumers protect most of the uninformed consumers, any injury incurred by the 
ignorant, reckless or foolish consumer will have a legal remedy, if at all, in contract, fraud or consumer protection law but not in 
antitrust. "
410,39," While the Sixth Circuit in PSI said that the ""evil"" that the Kodak decision condemned ""was Kodak's own actions that increased 
its customers' information costs"" (104 F.3d at 820), this is not a complete statement of what Kodak seems to condemn. It would 
be true that ""Kodak increased its customers' information costs only if prior to sale (1) it had already changed its parts policy but 
few customers yet knew this, or (2) it had already decided to change its parts policy in the future but chose not to disclose it. In 
these two situations, ""Kodak's own actions,"" or rather inaction by a choice not to disclose to each potential customer, would have 
increased the customers' cost of finding out this information. Full disclosure by Kodak would have lowered the information costs. 
PSI noted how Honeywell's disclosures actually ""reduce[d] the information costs faced by its customers."" 104 F.3d at 821. What 
appears to have occurred for many of Kodak's equipment customers is that after they bought Kodak equipment, Kodak took 
advantage of these customers' sunk costs and switching costs by its post-sale action of changing its parts policy. The Kodak majority opinion seems to leave open an antitrust law condemnation of this use of market power even if Kodak did 
not decide to change its parts policy until after the contract and would, therefore, not be subject to any common law claim for 
misrepresentation by knowing concealment of a material fact. Rather than ""Kodak's own actions . . . increasing its customers 
information costs"" (id.), Kodak's post-contract action took advantage of many customers switching costs. The Kodak majority's 
discussion of lock-in and switching costs makes it clear that this is what the majority opinion would, on certain facts, condemn. It 
is also clear in other language of PSI that the Sixth Circuit agrees with this. It suggests that ""an antitrust plaintiff can[] succeed 
on a Kodak-type theory when the defendant has . . . changed its policy after locking-in some of its customers."" Id. at 820. It 
suggests further that where the seller's policy change was made pre-contract but kept secret, or at least was not ""generally 
known,"" a Kodak-type theory might be available where ""the defendant has [not] been otherwise forthcoming about its [change in 
or plan to change] policies."" Id. "
411,," The information costs that PSI notes were discussed and dismissed in Jefferson Parish were not ones that the East Jefferson 
Hospital exploited by some post-lock-in change of policy as apparently occurred in Kodak. That is why PSI notes that 
""information costs tied in"" from market imperfections ""alone should not invoke antitrust condemnation."" Id. at 820. But, a post-
lock-in opportunistic change in policy to exploit these market imperfections could trigger a Kodak-type approach to market 
power. (This seems to be what occurred in Virtual Maintenance, Inc. v. Prime Computer, Inc., 11 F.3d 660, 663 (6th Cir. 1993) 
(""Virtual II"")). It is also a caveat highlighted in PSI: If there were any evidence in the record that Honeywell took advantage of its customers' imperfect information in order to 
reap supra-competitive profits in the aftermarkets for its equipment, we would not hesitate to allow a Kodak-type theory to 
be submitted to the jury. However, we can find nothing in the record or PSI's brief that alleges that Honeywell engaged in 
such activity."
411,104," F.3d at 821. Thus, PSI and Kodak seem consistent with Professor Grimes' analysis of the post-Kodak scope of antitrust law. Professor 
Grimes notes that ""the proper distinction here is that, as a policy matter, the law should address active intentional behavior that 
creates new consumer injury even if a similar injury created by a letter's passive reliance on market imperfections is beyond the 
law."" Grimes, supra, at 280. See full quote above at footnote 36. In Jefferson Parish, the market imperfections that the Court dismissed for antitrust market power purposes were those that 
worked to the advantage of all the rival hospitals in the area. Thus, East Jefferson Hospital was a ""passive"" beneficiary of these 
market imperfection, and it derived no significant market power for antitrust purposes from these market imperfections that also 
benefitted its rival hospitals. The Court noted that the one ""profit enhancing"" factor which resulted from East Jefferson's use of 
nurse-anesthetists was not related to any market imperfection and was a common practice ""utilized in all hospitals in the area."" 
466 U.S. at 28 n.47."
411,40," The Areeda authors note that ""antitrust law does not seek to protect the foolish consumer who can fully protect himself by 
taking the steps that most similarly situated consumers take (or are presumed to take)."" AREEDA, ET AL., P 1735d2, p. 67. ""We 
conclude that any power resulting from consumer failure to use readily available information, as used by most buyers, is not the 
kind of power that triggers the per se rule."" Id. at P l735d, p. 69. The Areeda authors suggest that a buyer's indifference or 
ignorance about market prices or the seller's opportunistic exploitation of an incomplete contract does not constitute ""market 
power unless buyer ignorance was the result of a general 'market failure' making the necessary information too costly for most 
buyers to obtain efficiently."" Id. at 69, 104, PP 1735d3 and 1738c."
411,41," Cf. Kodak, 504 U.S. at 503 (Scalia, dissenting)."
411,42, Other similarly situated sellers could also obtain these benefits flowing from basic market imperfections. 
412,43," Thus, a consumer pre-contract is deprived of the opportunity to shop around with rivals, seek contract or other protections 
from the seller, knowingly accept the risk or forego the investment."
412,44," Areeda, et al., note that ""higher prices . . . do not reflect [market] power when they disfavor the knowledgeable . . . ."" Id. at 138, 
P 1740. "
413,45," In another section, the Areeda authors note: We should not presume that fast-food restaurants lie in different markets from all other restaurants or that separate markets 
should be defined according to menus of hamburgers, chicken, seafood, pizza, and so on. While some courts defined 
narrow franchise markets, most of the franchise tying cases preceded the Supreme Court's insistence on genuine proof of 
power. The standard market definition methodology requires proof that fast-food restaurants or those with particular fare could 
maximize profits by charging significantly more than the competitive level. Such proof would be rare. If, as seems likely, the 
pre-fast-food restaurant business was highly -- perhaps even perfectly -- competitive, then fast food must have made its 
way with better quality (in terms of speed or consistency) or lower prices. Were prices to rise significantly, many patrons 
would return to nonfranchised fast-food establishments -- diners, coffee shops, ""family"" restaurants, and the like. Hence we 
would presume, for example that fast-food pizza franchises are not a market. AREEDA, ET AL., at 101, P 1737e3 (footnote omitted)."
413,46," This is clearest when the tying and tied products are purchased simultaneously, but the authors contend ""the same can be 
true for continuing future purchases. For example, suppose that the defendant conditions a permanent trademark license on the 
franchisee's agreement always to buy consumable supplies . . . from the defendant at prices specified in the original contract,"" 
even when these prices exceed market prices. Id. at 146-47. The franchisee can compare this premium in payment to the cost 
that would be necessary to obtain a rival franchise. The fact that the franchisee may later become locked in is irrelevant because 
he was not yet locked in when he accepted the tie. "
414,47," The authors later stress that the case for market power being measured after lock-in is particularly strong when there is a 
change in policy and ""if that [new] policy creates a tie. . . ."" Id. at 151 n.37. The authors also note that in order to show that a 
lock-in is ""substantial,"" there must be proof of substantial switching costs involving unrecoverable value and that this 
unrecoverable value in sunk costs exceeds the alleged above-market premium to be paid for the tying and more particular the 
tied product for the remaining useful life of the primary product or investment. Id. at 152. The authors reason that ""even if 
switching costs allow the defendant to extract some premium, it may be too small to constitute the substantial power that 
antitrust law usually demands."" Id. at 153. The authors also point out that a defendant can gain little from trying to exploit 
""locked in"" customers unless they are a substantial group as well as a substantial share of all of defendant's customers unless 
the defendant can price discriminate in favor of new customers that the defendant wishes to attract."
414,48, See AREEDA at 155 n.47. 
415,49," In the franchise situation, even where the franchisor is no longer selling new franchises and is merely profiting off of royalties 
and the sales of goods and services to existing franchises, the franchisor has little incentive to put these franchisees at a 
competitive disadvantage with respect to their competitors and to put them out of business because that will reduce the 
defendant's profit and possibly put the defendant out of business altogether."
415,50," The authors note the rare exception to this is the liquidating defendant who has no need to maintain a reputation to continue 
foremarket sales, or to maintain the goodwill of existing aftermarket customers, or the individual who has the capacity to price 
discriminate in favor of the new customers and against the old customers to allow the new customers to protect themselves from 
post-contract exploitation. Id. at 155 n.48. "
418,51," In reviewing a submission from defendants' January 31, 1995, Second Supplemental Brief Opposing Class Certification (which 
dealt with plaintiffs' initial class certification for pre- and post-mid-1990 franchisees), Exhibit 2 shows that as of August 1990 Blue 
Line had opened warehouses and began acting as a distributor in 10 of the current 16 regions. The other regions were served 
by LCE approved associate distributors. Four of the six distribution warehouses Blue Line opened between August 1990 and 
December 1992, when it opened its final warehouse, were more conveniently located warehouses for Little Caesar franchise 
units already being serviced by Blue Line from more distant warehouses. Yet, two of the warehouses opened after August 1990 
(Stockton, California in September 1991 and Fife, Washington in July 1992) did begin servicing 243 franchise units who before 
then bought from associate distributors Leprino Foods and Food Service of America, respectively. Also, in November 1990, Blue 
Line began servicing 107 franchise units in the Kansas City area from its Dallas warehouse, whereas before then these units 
bought supplies from associate distributor Pegler Sysco. There is no evidence in the record of how many owners of these 350 
units signed a mid-1990 Franchise Agreement at a time prior to Blue Line becoming the sole distributor in their area. Those 
class members who did sign the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement at a time they were still being serviced by an associate 
distributor are hereinafter referred to for purposes of identification as the ""Associate Distributor Class Members."" Plaintiffs' 
experts in their December 1996 declaration indicate there were 2,440 independent Little Caesar franchisees as of September 
1993. By the fall of 1992, nearly all regions of the country were being served by Blue Line. Thus, it is likely that the substantial 
majority of Little Caesar franchisees signing the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement did so at a time when Blue Line was the sole 
distributor in their region. The associate distributor franchisees who signed the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement at a time that an 
Associate Distributor operated in their region are in the certified class. Yet, much of my analysis in this Report of what was 
""generally known"" pre-contract -- which is necessary to do a Kodak-PSI determination of how the tying market is defined -- will 
not apply to these Associate Distributor Class Members. They will be considered separately. "
419,52," Again, for the Associate Distributor Class Members, as noted in footnote 52 above, this would not be apparent to them 
because they were buying their logoed and other goods from an associate distributor, not Blue Line, when they signed the mid-
1990 Franchise Agreement."
419,53," As noted in the earlier Report, the critical question for antitrust purposes is whether these ""intended acts"" ""were legal 
competitive behaviors"" or ""impermissible restraints on the market choice of consumers or on alternate potential distributors' 
ability to enter the market and compete with Blue Line"" and "". . . whether the actions of defendants impermissibly dissuaded 
potential alternate distributors from entering the market or from competing as effectively with Blue Line …."" Id. at 265-66. These 
questions were reserved in the class certification motion. ""While plaintiffs may ultimately fail to prove defendants' actions were 
illegal, or fail to prove any effect on prices, or fail to prove the tie-in of logoed products leveraged a larger tie-in, all of these are 
merit questions that should not affect the class certification question."" Id. at 266."

421,55," PYA Monarch and Schloss & Kahn stopped competing in the Atlanta area in 1989, and no class claims regarding the mid-
1990 Franchise Agreement effecting a tie-in directly involve these former Atlanta associate distributors. These LCE/Blue Line 
involvements with PYA Monarch are relevant to LCE's motive concerning its more recent action. It might also be relevant if 
plaintiffs could prove that these events, coupled with other LCE acts with the statute of limitations period, contributed to alternate 
distributors not seeking to enter the market and competing with Blue Line after class members were locked in to their mid-1990 
Franchise Agreements. "

qualified independent distributors suggests that there is no dispute over whether franchisees (both under the Pre-Mid 1990 
and Post-Mid 1990 contracts) had the right to seek approval of qualified third-party distributors and to expect that these 
distributors would be approved. Siwek and Nelson December 1996 Declaration at 4-5, P5(b), referring to Alan Harnisch's June 30, 1993, letter to L.D. Klenda 
noting that ""Little Caesar is prepared to and will continue to review requests to approve other potential distributors, and that each 
request is individually considered."" For purposes of this motion, I will consider that there is no dispute of material fact that each 
franchisee does have the contractual right to seek an alternate distributor which is derivative from its express contractual right to 
seek the approval of third-party suppliers. "
428,58," The authors use the standard definition of economic rent as: An economic rent is any payment to a factor that exceeds what would be required to bring that factor into existence. Economic 
rents arise in various contexts. For example, an economic actor may earn economic rents when he is more efficient than the 
marginal supplier that determines the market price. Id. at 10 n.11. "
429,59," The experts do not note that David Deal also testified that a new franchise offering circular was being prepared in December 
1994, and that LCE did expect to be offering new franchises for sale. Deal Dep. at 308."
429,60," The August 1990 Franchise Agreement, Section XVII C.3, precludes a franchisee during and for two years following the 
termination of the franchise agreement from engaging in a fast food operation in market areas selling pizza, pasta, submarine 
sandwiches or related products similar to those sold by a Little Caesar outlet. "
431,61," As noted above, those few class members who were in areas not being serviced by Blue Line at the time they considered 
signing a mid-1990 Franchise Agreement, the ""Associate Distributor Class Members,"" warrant separate consideration. "
432,62," While LCE denies the allegation that it had a policy in the early 1990's of not approving alternate distributors to rival Blue Line, 
if that was the policy, then there was a second change in that policy when in 1995 it approved the three alternate distributors "
433,," who applied in 1993 and 1994 -- PYA Monarch, Schloss and Kahn, and Gordon Food Service. Defendant notes that these three 
approved alternate distributors that were approved in 1995 have not entered the market to compete with Blue Line."
433,63," The LCE Offering Circular provided potential investors not only the number and location of other LCE carryout franchises, but 
also the names of the owners so that any prospective franchisee could contact existing franchise owners."
433,64," The exclusive licensing agreement and other documents obtained during discovery would support a finding that it was LCE's 
intention to use its legal monopoly over its proprietary marks to improve its competitive position vis-a-vis alternate potential 
distributors. While a potential franchise might not know that LCE intended to use its power in this manner, they would know LCE 
had that power to exercise if it chose to do so."
433,65," In most areas of the country from mid-1990 on, Blue Line was the sole source of such items. This would be known to any 
franchisee who signed the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement to renew their franchise. It could also readily be determined by any 
potential new franchisee, who had never had a Little Caesar franchise, by either inquiring of Little Caesar during their franchise 
negotiations or calling any of the hundreds of franchisees listed in the Offering Circular. This is the case even though the mid-
1990 Franchise Agreement does not expressly tie logoed products to the continued operation of a Little Caesar franchise. Defendant argues in this Motion for Partial Summary Judgment that sufficient disclosures were made pre-contract to inform 
potential franchisees that signing the mid-1990 Franchise Agreement exposed the franchisee to a requirement that to continue 
as a Little Caesar's franchisee logoed products would have to be purchased from Blue Line. Plaintiffs in their Second 
Supplemental Brief note that defendant in its earlier efforts to defeat the plaintiffs' first motion for class certification argued that: LCE intended that only one category of items, logoed products, be purchased only from Blue Line. (Deal Decl. P 
10) Although this intent was expressed in an internal document and in letters to logoed paper suppliers and third party 
distributors, the intent was never communicated in any uniform written or oral communication to the franchisees (Id.) The 
franchise agreement was amended in mid 1990 to provide that a franchisee could not request additional sources for logoed 
products, but does not Inform franchisees who signed the new agreement that Blue Line was the only existing 
source of logoed paper products. . . . thus, a franchisee would have to be a mind reader to have discerned that 
Little Caesar's intent was that logoed products be purchased only from Blue Line. Plaintiffs' Second Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 3, filed April 4, 1997, 
quoting Defendant's Brief in Opposition to Class Certification, pp. 9-10, filed July 13, 1994, Docket # 43. (Emphasis supplied by 
plaintiffs' counsel.) This ""mind reader"" argument was later repeated in oral arguments. Defendant responds that plaintiff's lead counsel argued in the second class certification motion that "
434,," As a practical matter, most of the franchisees, generally speaking, were aware of the fact that they didn't have any options, 
that there was no place else to go other than Little Caesar's. Certainly up until 1995, no other distributor was ever 
approved, not ever, so they had to go buy all their goods -- I mean, they had no place else to go. July 22, 1996 Hearing Transcript at 45. Plaintiffs' experts also acknowledge that ""the modification of the 'supply clause' in Mid-1990 revealed a contractual tie . . ."" 
although the use of it to exclude rival distributors was not disclosed. While defendant's earlier adversarial arguments serving the moment may later appear inconsistent with current arguments, this 
Court must determine the facts and the legal implications from the facts based on the record and its best assessment of the legal 
interpretation that can be placed on the facts. It is not appropriate in doing so to seek to punish any past rhetorical 
overstatements. As my initial Report and Recommendation on Class Certification indicated, I did not accept defendant's ""mind 
reader"" argument then, nor do I feel bound by it now."
434,66," This issue is disputed by the defendant that contends AmeriServ was willing to enter the distribution market without logoed 
goods. Defendant also contends that the number of franchisees in each distribution area are insufficient to make it economically 
feasible for there to be more than one distributor. Again, for purposes of this motion it will be assumed that if approved and 
provided access to logoed goods, a rival distributor could enter the market in each region or in some other geographical market 
combining or modifying existing distribution regions."
434,67," Obviously at some level of supracompetitive pricing a rival distributor could enter the market and compete without logoed 
goods because it could ""beat"" the blended margin overcharges of Blue Line on the market basket of goods, and the preference 
of franchisees for ""one stop"" shopping will fade if it becomes too expensive. "
436,68," As noted above, any other possible ""wrongful plan"" of illegally denying approval to a qualified alternative distributor will be 
litigated in Garyt Smith's individual case."
436,69," While Burgess says that he could not compete without access to logoed goods, plaintiffs have submitted no evidence that any 
other distributors in the United States were dissuaded from seeking to become a competitor of Blue Line because of their 
awareness of this policy of LCE denying them access to logoed goods. "

almost impossibly difficult, requiring as it would the contacting of 'every single seller . . . [for the purpose of] getting their gross 
[sales] numbers all over the world.'"" Appellee's Brief at 12 (internal citation omitted). "
445,2," At oral argument, counsel for Lucas Automotive stated: Judge Davies did note on page 7 of his memorandum decision granting summary judgment: ""Lucas has also been unable 
to re-enter the market for the original equipment major brand vintage tires because it has been unable to secure the 
exclusive distributor rights to another major brand vintage tire. Lucas argues that these losses flow from the acquisition of 
monopoly power by Coker."" So he understands what we're saying - that we've been excluded from effective, meaningful 
participation in the market at the distribution level. "
446,3," Even if the indirect purchaser rule did not apply in this case, Lucas Automotive has not shown that it has paid higher prices as 
an indirect purchaser as a result of Coker Tire's acquisition of the Firestone line. We examine whether Lucas Automotive has 
succeeded in demonstrating that it is threatened with higher prices as an indirect purchaser in Part II.B.2. "
447,4," At oral argument, Lucas Automotive's counsel stated, ""If the defendant is able to exclude you through its pricing practices from 
competing, then you lose sales."" Because Lucas Automotive has not specifically alleged that Coker Tire has engaged or 
threatens to engage in predatory pricing, we decline to address this issue on appeal. "
448,***, Writing for the court as to Part II.B.2 only. 
449,5," The dissent faults Lucas Automotive for not having offered ""a shred of evidence as to the cross elasticity of demand between 
original equipment vintage tires of different sizes."" What there is not a shred of evidence on is that there is any substitutability 
between original equipment vintage tires of different sizes. Moreover, in these circumstances, the burden to show cross elasticity 
of demand to defeat plaintiff's prima facie case would seem to fall on Coker Tire. Lucas Automotive should not be required to 
prove a negative - the non-existence of a cross elasticity of demand. "
450,1," The cross elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in the quantity of a good demanded for each one-percent 
change in the price of a substitute good. See H. Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law Par. 1.1, at 62 (1985)."
450,2," I do not take the majority's analysis as challenging the district court's conclusion that the relevant market is that of original

468,1," The letter to U.S. Healthcare read: Dear Sirs: This letter is to advise U.S. Healthcare that effective June 30th, 1991, . . . Gary's will discontinue its medical insurance 
coverage with your organization. Please adjust your records to reflect this upcoming change and advise me of any 
information you may need to finalize our relationship."
468,2," In contrast, Chen testified to the receipt of a polite and professional phone call from a Blue Cross/Blue Shield representative, 
inquiring if they could accommodate Gary's needs in anyway and as to the reason behind Gary's decision to cancel their health 
care contract."
468,3," When asked by BCI's counsel whether he ordered the review of Gary's in response to Gary's decision to terminate with U.S. 
Healthcare, Wolfson responded: Well, I didn't think it was appropriate with an account that we had a relationship with just to send a ""dear sir"" letter [of 
termination] to a post office box . . . . I didn't feel that they were giving us due consideration and if they were operating in 
that fashion, I wanted to look to see if in fact there were any other issues related to the I Got It At Gary's Pharmacies. "
472,4," The record does not develop the extent to which these complaints may have been facilitated by New Jersey's enactment, in 
July 1994, of an Any Willing Provider statute which provides that a pharmacy cannot be excluded from an HMO if it ""accepts the 
terms"" of the HMO. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 26:2J-4.7(a)(2) (West 1996)."
472,5," The district court's initial order of judgment made it unclear whether BCI was to receive $ 200,000 in total compensatory 
damages, or to recover that amount separately on each of its three legal theories (thus allowing a total recovery of $ 600,000 in 
compensatory damages). In response to defendants' motion, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 59(e), to alter or amend the order 
of judgment, the district court subsequently amended its order to make clear that BCI may recover only once the $ 200,000 in 
compensatory damages that it was awarded. BCI does not dispute this point on appeal. "
473,6," Of course, not all tying arrangements have anti-competitive effects in violation of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court has 
twice made use of the following as an example of a tie that is not a concern of the antitrust laws: ""If one of a dozen food stores in 
a community were to refuse to sell flour unless the buyer also took sugar it would hardly tend to restrain competition if its 
competitors were ready and able to sell flour by itself."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (quoting Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958)). 
Indeed package sales such as those noted in the foregoing example may be used by a seller as a means of competing, and may 
be desired by buyers. The Sherman Act is not designed to preclude such arrangements. See id."
473,7," This is distinguished from ""mutual"" reciprocal dealing which occurs ""when both parties stand on equal footing with respect to 
purchasing power, yet they agree to purchase from one another."" Betaseed, 681 F.2d at 1216. "
474,8," Defendants suggest that we set forth a rule for judging reciprocal dealing arrangements in W. L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. Carlisle 
Corp., 529 F.2d 614, 624 (3d Cir. 1976) where we stated that: The use of substantial purchasing power in one product market to coerce a supplier into a reciprocating purchase in 
another market may be an illegal restraint of trade if the user's purchasing power is sufficiently substantial and its use 
results in substantial foreclosure of competition in the other weaker product market. In Gore, the owner of two patents brought an action for infringement. The defendant's answer denied the validity of the patents, 
asserted that one of the patents was unenforceable because of fraud in its procurement, and counterclaimed for damages 
alleging a violation of the Sherman Act. After trial, the district court entered a judgment holding one of the patents valid and 
infringed and the other patent invalid, granting the plaintiff an injunction restraining the defendant from infringing the valid patent, 
and determining that plaintiff had violated the Sherman Act. Both parties appealed from the judgment. In determining that we 
had jurisdiction to review the injunction, we expressly stated that we had no jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal over the 
antitrust counterclaim of the defendant. See id. at 618. Thus, the statement in Gore regarding reciprocal dealing was dicta, and 
does not establish a rule."
474,9," In support of this view, defendants primarily rely on Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law, a leading treatise. Areeda argues 
that ""forced reciprocal exchanges are . . . legally distinct from ties and need not receive the same antitrust treatment."" X Areeda, 
Antitrust Law P 1750c, at 268 (1996). He believes that reciprocal trading should not be illegal per se, and that such a claim 
should instead be judged solely under the rule of reason test. See Id. P 1778, at 460-61. Professor Areeda's view may be 
colored by his belief that tying arrangements also should not be illegal per se, a view that is contrary to current law. See IX 
Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1730, at 406 14 (1991). "
475,10," See, e.g., Betaseed, Inc. v. U&I, Inc., 681 F.2d 1203, 1221 (9th Cir. 1982) (""The similarity between coercive reciprocity and 
tying arrangements, both in form and in anti-competitive consequences, leads to the conclusion that the two practices should be 
judged by similar standards.""); Spartan Grain & Mill Co. v. Ayers, 581 F.2d 419, 425 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding that label of tying 
and reciprocal dealing was immaterial, and that the per se standard should be applied in both); E.T. Barwick Indus. v. Walter E. 
Heller & Co., 692 F. Supp. 1331 (N.D. Ga. 1987) (same legal standards apply to reciprocal dealing as tying), aff'd 891 F.2d 906 
(11th Cir. 1989). See also II Earl W. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 10.67, at 264-65 (1980) (""The very presence of the 
element of coercion indicates that such reciprocal dealings are only anti-competitive in effect. It is widely agreed that coercive 
reciprocality, like tying arrangements, should be considered a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."")."
475,11," The other issues have not been briefed by the parties. The third element is plainly not disputed. While arguably there is an 
implicit challenge to the first element, it would involve the characterization question, and we need not reach it. "
476,12," We assume that membership in the U.S. Healthcare network remained profitable after U.S. Healthcare lowered its payment 
schedule. To the extent that BCI is arguing that pharmacies stayed in the U.S. Healthcare network despite the fact that it 
became unprofitable to do so, this argument renders their overall claim a non sequitur. U.S. Healthcare cannot exercise control 
over pharmacies via access to its network where membership in that network causes pharmacies to lose money. "
478,13," Defendants rely primarily on evidence that Gary's advertised in the greater Philadelphia area to support their expansive 
conception of the geographic market. This reliance is misplaced since ""the geographic market is not comprised of the region in 
which the seller attempts to sell its product, but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a 
product."" Tunis Bros., 952 F.2d at 726."
478,14," Defendants also argue that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the survey. We also agree with this contention; 
however, since we conclude that even if the survey were admitted, it would not help BCI, we address the methodological errors 
that should have barred its admission only briefly. HN11[
] Survey results offered as proof of the matter asserted are hearsay, and thus the results of a survey, and any testimony 
based on those results, cannot be admitted into evidence unless the survey falls into a recognized class exception to the 
hearsay rule or into the residual exception contained in Fed. R. Evid. 803(24). See Pittsburgh Press Club v. United States, 579 
F.2d 751, 755-58 (3d Cir. 1978). In this case none of the class exceptions are present, so we examine whether the survey 
contains the ""circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness"" required for admissibility under Rule 803(24). In Pittsburgh Press, we stated that ""HN12[
] the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness are for the most part satisfied if 
the poll is conducted in accordance with generally accepted survey principles."" Id. at 758. We then discussed several factors 
which must be examined in determining whether a poll meets generally accepted survey principles "
479,," A proper universe must be examined and a representative sample must be chosen; the persons conducting the survey 
must be experts; the data must be properly gathered and accurately reported. It is essential that the sample design, the 
questionnaires and the manner of interviewing meet the standards of objective surveying and statistical techniques. Id. The proponent of the evidence has the burden of establishing these elements of admissibility. See id. In this case, we find that 
this burden was not met and that the methodology of the survey was so flawed that the district court's decision to admit it was 
not consistent with the exercise of sound discretion. Knowlton's survey was designed to determine U.S. Healthcare's market share in the region close to three of Gary's six pharmacy 
locations. To determine market share, he had pharmacy students call six to eight to pharmacies within varying distances of each 
of the three pharmacies (resulting in a total universe of twenty pharmacies). The pharmacists at these pharmacies were then 
asked to name the HMO with which they did the majority of their business, and to report the percentage of their prescription 
business for which that HMO was responsible. This methodology is flawed in several respects. We identify two particularly significant errors. First, the survey questions used 
were not objective. For example, pharmacists were asked: You provide services for people with prescription cards, like PCS and Paid, et cetera. You also provide services for people 
on specific HMO plans like Keystone, U.S. Healthcare, et cetera. What's the name of the HMO with which you did the most 
prescription business . . .? This question improperly slants the response by highlighting respondent to U.S. Healthcare's market presence. People 
responding to a survey tend to react to the framing of a question. See, e.g. J.R. Eiser, Social Psychology 219-20 (1986). In 
addition, this question specifically excluded large institutional, non-HMO purchasers of prescription drugs such as PCS and 
PAID. As a result, it narrowed the product market from ""purchasers of prescription drugs"" to ""HMO purchasers of prescription 
drugs"". Second, while Knowlton surveyed 20 pharmacies, he only used the data obtained from 14 of those pharmacies in tabulating his 
results. This decision resulted from the fact that only fourteen of the twenty pharmacies surveyed named U.S. Healthcare as 
their largest HMO customer. Knowlton simply ignored the other six pharmacies whose data presumably stated a lower estimate 
of U.S. Healthcare's market share. This type of selective analysis violates the requirement that, in order for survey results to be 
admissible, the ""data must be properly gathered and accurately reported"". We conclude that the cumulative effect of these, and other, methodological errors render it impossible to say that this survey 
was ""conducted in accordance with generally accepted survey principles,"" and thus it should not have been admitted. "
480,15," We note that evidence produced at trial showed that 16% of the residents of the greater Philadelphia area belong to a U.S. 
Healthcare plan. We assume, therefore, that U.S. Healthcare's market share in the relevant geographic market lies somewhere 
between 16%, its share in an impermissibly broad geographic market, and 25%, its share in an impermissibly narrow one."
480,16," We further note that while it is apparent that Rite-Aid, Phar-Mor and Weis Markets are large chains, pharmacies are only a 
part of their business and BCI has offered no specific evidence that the number of pharmacies affected by the alleged tie-ins 
constituted ""an appreciable number of buyers within the market."""
480,17, See supra at 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 6591 at *31-32. 
481,18," BCI contends that by failing to specifically challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of anti-competitive effects in the tied 
market in their pre-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), defendants waived 
their right to raise that specific argument in their post-trial Rule 50 motions, or thereafter. In their pre-trial motions, made both at 
the conclusion of plaintiff's case and at the conclusion of all evidence, the defendants' challenge to the sufficiency of the 
evidence on the rule of reason claim read: The evidence is insufficient to support a finding or sustain a verdict that U.S. Healthcare's practices constituted an 
unreasonable restraint of trade in light of all the circumstances of the case. Plaintiff has offered no such evidence. HN15[
] Under Rule 50(a), a pre-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law ""shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment."" Further, a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law 
made pursuant to Rule 50(b) ""must be preceded by a Rule 50(a) motion sufficiently specific to afford the party against whom the 
motion is directed with an opportunity to cure possible defects in proof which otherwise might make its case legally insufficient."" 
Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1173 (3d Cir. 1993) (quoting Acosta v. Honda Motor Co., 717 F.2d 828, 831-32 
(3d Cir. 1983)); see also Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 183-84 (3d Cir. 1992) (compliance with Rule 
50(a) ""ensures that the party bearing the burden of proof will have an opportunity to buttress its case before it goes to the jury 
and the moving party will not gain unfair advantage through surprise.""). While the text of the Rule 50(a) motion quoted above is far from a model of completeness or clarity, we do not measure its 
sufficiency by the text alone, but against the background, as reflected in the record, of what the party now claiming waiver 
understood as to the tenor of the Rule 50 movant's position and theory. See Acosta, 717 F.2d at 832 (""The communicative 
content, 'specificity' and notice giving function of an assertion [in a rule 50(a) motion] should be judged in context."") In Fineman, 
for example, we held that a general motion for a directed verdict contesting the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to 
""coercion"" preserved defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the tortious interference claim, 
because ""plaintiffs' counsel was clearly on notice of the legal rubric under which [defendants] planned to proceed."" 980 F.2d at 
184. We think that is the case here, and hence find no waiver. "
482,19," Since we find that the jury verdict must be set aside, we need not address defendants challenge to the rule of reason jury 
instructions. "
483,20," We note, however, that BCI's RICO standing is limited to injuries arising from its competition with U.S. Healthcare for Gary's 
TPA business. BCI does not have RICO standing to recover for any injuries suffered by other pharmacies as a result of their 
relations with U.S. Healthcare since there is no evidence that these relations directly injured BCI. "
485,21," See United States v. Zappola, 677 F.2d 264, 269, 270 (2d Cir. 1982) (Enmons inapplicable where businessmen beat and 
threatened victim to coerce payment of alleged debt); United States v. Porcaro, 648 F.2d 753, 759-60 (1st. Cir. 1981) (claim of 
right to property irrelevant where force or threats are used in resolution of contractual dispute); United States v. Kattar, 840 F.2d 
118, 123 n.2 (1st Cir. 1988) (""Except in certain labor contexts . . . using threats of violence to induce the payment of money is 
unlawful, regardless of the extortionist's possible legal right to the funds at issue.""); United States v. Sturm, 870 F.2d 769, 772-
73 (1st Cir. 1989) (defendants ""claim of right"" to property obtained from victim is proper defense outside of labor context only if 
defendant did not use ""inherently wrongful"" means such as force or violence to obtain the property); United States v. Warledo, 
557 F.2d 721, 729-30 (10th Cir. 1977) (Enmons inapplicable to Indian tribe's threats and violence to pursue allegedly valid claim 
against railroad); United States v. Cohen, 738 F.2d 287, 289 (8th Cir. 1984). "
488,22," Indeed, if Pennsylvania had such a law not only might the outcome of this suit, at least as it pertains to the RICO counts, be 
different, but it is likely that the underlying facts would never have occurred. Those facts, which demonstrate how heavy-handed 
tactics can be effectively applied by a large corporation (U.S. Healthcare) against a small firm (Gary's) in this context, might 
suggest to the Pennsylvania General Assembly that it is time to enact an Any Willing Provider law in Pennsylvania."
488,23," This is also not a case where U.S. Healthcare exerted monopoly power in the market for pharmaceutical customers. Under 
such circumstances, the antitrust laws might well confer on Gary's the legal right to be free of the economic coercion arising from 
U.S. Healthcare's monopoly. However, we are not presented with such a case and thus do not opine on the potential success of 
such a theory."
488,24," Since we conclude that each of these allegations of wrongful objectives lacks support, we need not decide whether proof that 
defendants' possessed one of these objectives would be sufficient to convert U.S. Healthcare's use of the fear of economic loss 
into extortion where U.S. Healthcare had a lawful right to the property obtained."
488,25," The district court also instructed the jury that one such unlawful objective would be ""a violation of the Federal antitrust laws."" In 
light of the fact that we vacate the antitrust verdict, this instruction alone might compel us to vacate the jury finding with respect 
to extortion and, indeed, to the whole of the RICO count. However, since we find that both claims fall of their own weight, we 
need not rely on this flawed jury instruction as grounds for reversal, and thus do not address BCI's contention that U.S. 
Healthcare waived any objection to the instruction. "
489,26," BCI's claim that U.S. Healthcare had the unlawful objective of violating the New Jersey Any Willing Provider Law, see N.J.S. 
26:2J-4.7(a)(2), fails because BCI has RICO standing only to recover for the loss of its TPA contract with Gary's, all of whose 
pharmacies are located in Pennsylvania. BCI's argument that U.S. Healthcare had the unlawful objective of violating its own internal regulations is founded on BCI's 
assertion that U.S. Healthcare's internal regulations required it to admit into its network all pharmacies whose applications met 
U.S. Healthcare's admission criteria. BCI's brief, however, does not clearly specify the exact regulation(s) in which such a 
requirement is contained, and it is not at all clear that such regulations exist. At all events, BCI's claim must fail since, even if 
U.S. Healthcare's regulations did contain such a requirement, we see no reason why violation of an internal regulation regarding 
provider admission would be unlawful."
489,27, See 28 Pa. Code. § 9.71 (1997). 
490,28," Further, to the extent that BCI contends that U.S. Healthcare's proffered justification for the audit -- Gary's excessive use of 
brand name drugs -- was an overt misrepresentation, we disagree. The record shows that Gary's employees conceded that the 
stated reason was accurate, and that the audit revealed that Gary's was using generic drugs far less than the network average 
and inadequately documenting decisions not to use them. Our conclusion does not diminish BCI's claim that the audit was 
intended to coerce Gary's choice of TPA providers since even a ""legitimate"" audit may, based on timing and other 
circumstances, have a coercive purpose and effect. "
491,29," Defendants have also argued that the aiding and abetting liability imposed on the three U.S. Healthcare executives cannot 
survive because the statutory analysis applied to securities cases by the Supreme Court in Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First 
Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119, 114 S. Ct. 1439 (1994), if applied to the RICO statute, would 
eliminate RICO aiding and abetting liability. In view of the dismissal of the RICO claims, that argument need not be reached. "
492,30," BCI's contract with Gary's provided that ""either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason or no reason at any time 
upon thirty (30) days written notice."" This language clearly marks the contract as terminable at will upon proper notice. "
494,31," We reject defendants' argument that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law since the only direct evidence that Gary's 
was coerced consists of hearsay testimony from three BCI employees to whom Gary's Robin Risler indicated that she was 
forced to fire BCI, and testimony from Sandra Chen that Gary Wolf had indicated to her that he was under pressure to entertain 
a bid for U.S. Healthcare's TPA service. The district court properly admitted these statements pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 803(3), 
the ""state of mind"" exception to the hearsay rule, with the limiting instruction that the jury should not view the testimony as proof 
of the truth of the underlying facts asserted. Defendants contend that despite this instruction, the jury must have improperly used 
the testimony as substantive evidence of coercion, because there was no other evidence of coercion. We disagree with this 
conclusion and with the defendants' view of the evidence, since we believe that there is ample circumstantial evidence from 
which a jury could have reasonably inferred that Gary's was coerced. Defendants are, of course, free to argue their view of the 
evidence on remand. "
495,32," We do not believe that any doubt is cast on the applicability of this general rule by the fact that this case was submitted to the 
jury on special interrogatories and thus, unlike the cases cited, the jury did not render a general verdict. Our reading of the 
verdict sheet submitted to the jury in this case indicates that, at least as to the tortious interference count, the verdict rendered 
by the jury was the functional equivalent of a general verdict. The sole question relating to tortious interference liability posed to 
the jury was Do you find that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the following defendants intentionally 
interfered with the plaintiff's existing or prospective contractual relations. "
496,," As this interrogatory in no way facilitates our inquiry into the basis for the jury verdict, we find that the general rule requiring 
remand stated in Wilburn and Avins governs."
496,33," HN40[
] Rule 49(a) provides: (a) Special Verdicts. The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon 
each issue of fact. In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief 
answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and 
evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems 
most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as 
may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact 
raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives the right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless 
before the jury retires the party demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand the court 
may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the 
special verdict. "
497,34," On retrial, the jury will have to consider anew whether defendants' behavior was outrageous enough to warrant an award of 
punitive damages under Pennsylvania law. See Takes v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 440 Pa. Super. 101, 655 A.2d 138, 146 (Pa. 
Super. 1995) HN41[
] (""Punitive damages will lie only in cases of outrageous behavior, where defendant's egregious conduct 
shows either an evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others."") While the original jury found malice on the part of 
U.S. Healthcare and its executives, such a finding may not be inevitable at retrial where the jury will not be under the mistaken 
impression that defendants' conduct violated the Sherman Act, civil RICO, and the statutes underlying the predicate acts of the 
RICO count. We, of course, intimate no view on that subject. "
501,1," Dr. Ramey personally is not a party to this case. In fact, on November 10, 1997, California revoked Dr. Ramey's medical 
license for gross negligence in his treatment of a patient, although revocation was stayed and Ramey was placed on probation 
for a term of two years. At the same time, the report noted that Dr. Ramey had practiced for twenty-six years without any 
disciplinary action having been taken against him, and that he was a competent and caring physician. Because Plaintiff's 
counsel has continued to prosecute this lawsuit, the Court infers that Dr. Ramey's practice continues to operate, and that it will 
allegedly suffer antitrust injuries from Defendant's practices. However, Dr. Ramey's declaration, filed on October 24, 1997, states 
that he recently sold his practice and that he is currently taking a sabbatical, but that he later intends to return to work as an 
independent contractor at his former practice. Were the Court not granting summary judgment to Defendant, it would need to 
consider whether these facts would affect this lawsuit."
501,2," These patients are sometimes referred to as ""PFMC-affiliated patients"" in this Order. However, it is important to note that the 
patients do not have a direct relationship with Defendant, nor are their health care choices controlled by Defendant. Their 
relationship with Defendant is based upon the contract between their insurer and Defendant. "
502,3," In some cases, the contracts between Defendant and third-party payors provide that Defendant will process and collect 
payments for the payors."
502,4," Dr. Ramey, and not the Plaintiff, J. Allen Ramey, M.D., Inc., was a member of PFMC. Plaintiff itself did not apply for 
membership. See footnote 1 of this Order. "
503,5," The Maricopa Foundation represented 70% of the practitioners in Maricopa County.  Maricopa, 457 U.S. at 339. The Supreme 
Court was unable to determine precisely the membership of the Pima Foundation, noting that a 1975 publication reported 80% 
membership, while an affidavit filed in 1978 as part of the case reported 30%.  Id. at 340 n. 8. "
506,6," A defendant's behavior may fairly be characterized as predatory when the defendant is ""attempting to exclude rivals on some 
basis other than efficiency."" Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 605, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 
2847 (1985) (citations omitted). HN5[
] Bare allegations of threatened predatory pricing are inadequate to establish antitrust 
injury; the circumstances must be such as to make such an allegation credible. ""Courts should not find allegations of predatory 
pricing credible when the alleged predator is incapable of successfully pursuing a predatory scheme."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of 
Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 120 n. 15, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). In this case, the record is void of any indication 
that Defendant possesses sufficient market power to pose a credible threat of predatory pricing."
506,7," Plaintiff's supplemental pleadings do not materially address ARCO. Instead, Plaintiff continues to repeat Maricopa's explanation 
of why the alleged acts were illegal per se. As this Order has explained, the applicability of the per se test is an entirely separate 
matter from antitrust injury.  ARCO, 495 U.S. at 344. Antitrust injury was not part of the appeal before the Supreme Court in 
Maricopa, so its opinion does not address the issue. The Maricopa plaintiff, the state of Arizona, should have been required to 
establish antitrust injury; only the United States is authorized to sue directly under the Sherman Act. At the time Maricopa was 
decided, some courts were less concerned with antitrust injury in injunctive relief suits, at least for a state government. It is 
irrelevant for the purposes of this motion why Maricopa does not address antitrust injury; the law is clear that a private individual 
plaintiff must establish antitrust injury as a prerequisite for both legal and injunctive relief. However, the Court notes that Arizona 
could have alleged antitrust injuries from suppression of medical competition that would increase its public aid burden, or argued 
that it was suing on behalf of its consumers (the availability of the latter argument is debatable). These arguments are not 
available to Plaintiff in this case. "
507,8," Plaintiff has already entered the market. Therefore, it cannot suffer an antitrust injury related to barriers to market entry."
507,9," A court might reject a member-doctor's allegation of antitrust injury on the grounds that the doctor voluntarily agreed to the 
maximum-price policy."
507,10," The Court recognizes that many PFMC-affiliated patients will never even be aware of Plaintiff's availability. However, 
Defendant has no duty to advertise Plaintiff's services and is not prohibited from encouraging patients to patronize preferred 
providers. The Ninth Circuit noted in a similar, but vertical, case involving maximum medical prices established by an insurance 
company, ""We agree that paying lower benefits for treatment by nonparticipating physicians greatly discourages patients from 
using such physicians. This, however, is simply a consequence of every commercial contract . . . . The contract does not mean 
that the parties have agreed to an unlawful concerted refusal to deal. Under the Plan, the consumer still enjoys complete 
freedom to seek treatment from a nonparticipating physician. … Ordinary competitive market forces--lower prices--have simply 
reduced the demand for the nonparticipating physician's services.  Barry v. Blue Cross of California, 805 F.2d 866, 872 (9th Cir. 
1986). "
508,11," Defendant notes that its pricing policies contemplate and provide for the use of advanced services, including lasers, when 
such services are warranted under Defendant's practice standards. It also appears that a review process exists to consider 
atypical cases. "
509,12," In many cases, these determinations are made on their merits, reviewed under the rule of reason, rather than as a question of 
antitrust injury. However, the Court need not make such a determination since Dr. Ramey is not a party. The citations are 
provided to illustrate the unlikelihood that this cause of action could be successful. "
522,1, Lawson has about an eleven percent market share of the North American postcard business. 
523,2," Southern Card asserts that ""there are approximately eight main line independent postcard distributors in the state of Florida."""
523,3," It may well be that in the mid-to-late 1980s, Southern Card and Lawson entered into an informal arrangement whereby 
Southern Card acted as Lawson's exclusive vendor to chain stores in exchange for Lawson's promise not to sell Disney 
postcards to Southern Card's competitors. On November 22, 1989, John Nyberg, Southern Card's president, wrote to the 
chairman of the board of H.S. Crocker, detailing the ""history of the relationship"" between the two companies. Nyberg wrote that 
he had ""wanted exclusivity on all H.S. Crocker postcard products, including all Walt Disney World items within [Southern Card's] 
territorial area,"" and that ""with the understanding that H.S. Crocker would not manufacture for, or sell to any other distributor in 
the territory serviced by Southern Card & Novelty, our companies began to do business."" Nyberg also acknowledged the 
existence of this arrangement when deposed on April 18, 1996, stating, ""So de facto, I became--Southern Card & Novelty 
became the exclusive vendor to the chain stores. Although there was never any such agreement made between myself and 
Lawson Mardon, it had indeed evolved that way."" However, in an affidavit dated July 30, 1996, Nyberg averred that while the 
parties had entered into an exclusivity agreement concerning retailers in Daytona Beach, they ""had no territorial exclusive 
agreement for Orlando."" For purposes of this appeal, we accept this assertion as true."
523,4, About seventy percent of Southern Card's revenue is attributable to its sale of local view postcards.
523,5," Since 1994, Southern Card has continued to purchase these Disney postcards from Lawson but has acquired its entire local 
view stock from other manufacturers. "
524,6," Southern Card's expert witness, Dr. Bruce Seaman, subsequently opined that Southern Card had suffered two types of injuries. 
According to Dr. Seaman, Southern Card ""suffered economic damages linked to the overcharge on the tied non-Disney post 
cards."" Also, Lawson's ""refusal to allow Southern Card access to a full Disney array of post card products and other types of 
products has affected and will continue to affect Southern's profits on existing chain store accounts as well as the likelihood that 
chain store clients will continue to be lost due to the resulting weakening of Southern's relative competitive position."" "
525,7," Because Southern Card does not discuss its state tying claim independently and fails to cite any Florida case law, we assume 
that federal antitrust doctrine controls that claim as well. See Fla. Stat. Ann. § 542.32 (West 1997); see also Parts Depot Co. v. 
Florida Auto Supply, Inc., 669 So. 2d 321, 324 (Fla.App. 4th D.C.A.1996) (""The Legislature has directed courts to rely on

565,5," In the technical community comprising the personal computer industry, these microprocessors are also called ""central 
processing units,"" or ""CPUs."" The court may from time to time in this opinion refer to them using any of those three terms."
565,6," Of primary interest in the present context is the ""workstation"" which comprises the largest part of Intergraph's business. A 
""workstation"" is defined as [A] machine designed to run as fast as possible, that includes not only the CPU, such as a Pentium II, but all the different 
subsystems that go within the machine. That means that the machines cost a little bit more, in some cases a lot more, but the 
customers that we sell those to are willing to pay more because performance is everything to them. Workstations are powerful computers designed to run demanding scientific, engineering, design and graphic intensive 
applications. They are generally used in the design of complex facilities such as nuclear power plants and bridges. They are also 
used in the entertainment and motion picture industry for creating special effects and animation for movies and for television 
commercials. (Tr. 54-55)."
565,7," By affidavit, Mr. Patterson testified: Intel's 386 and 486 computer chips became popular in the early eighties, through their inclusion in the IBM personal computer 
(""PC""). The Intel x86 chips were the brain of the IBM PC, but were only designed to handle low end tasks. Intel's x86 chips were 
not capable of handling high-end workstation needs. However, the IBM PC was an ""open architecture"" system which permitted 
others to design their own IBM ""compatible"" PCs. As a result, ""open architecture"" and ""compatibility"" became of utmost 
importance to personal computer users. ""Open architecture"" compatibility also became of utmost importance to workstation 
users. (First Patterson Aff. 5). "
566,8," A ""PC"" is generally described as a less powerful computer than a ""workstation"" and is generally used by individuals for 
business, academic, and pleasure uses. Many PCs, also called ""desktops,"" are quite powerful and many, particularly those used 
in businesses and academia, are interconnected through networks"" that are hosted by one or more servers."
566,9," The ""x86"" line of computer chips apparently derives its name from the Intel 8086 and 8088 chips, which powered the first IBM 
line of personal computers, beginning in the early 1980s."
566,10," A ""laptop"" is a small battery powered portable computer that, at least in theory, will fit on one's ""lap."""
566,11," ""With a ninety percent market share in PC microprocessors, Intel's sales have headed skyward, growing fifty to eighty percent 
annually for the past four years. That made it ""the eighth-most-profitable company in the world in 1996…."" Business Week, 
December 22, 1997, p. 70."
566,12," In its issue of December 22, 1997, Business Week reported that Intel was spending $ 4.5 billion in 1997 on new chip making 
plants."
566,13," Other manufacturers of personal computer CPUs based upon the ""open"" architecture previously used by Intel are Cyrix, AMD, 
and IBM. (Tr. 106). As noted, combined they, and perhaps other manufacturers, share less than fifteen percent of the market."
566,14," These operating systems are Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT. Just as other 
microprocessors may be used with the Microsoft computer operating systems, those operating systems are capable of being 
used with microprocessors other than those made by Intel. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that microprocessors and 
computer operating systems are freely interchangeable. They are not. Instead, operating systems, microprocessors, and 
computer subsystems, such as Intergraph's graphics subsystems, must be carefully matched to assure reliable optimum 
performance. For example, several years ago IBM and Motorola engaged in a joint effort to create and produce an alternative to 
Intel's high performance microprocessors. The IBM/Motorola microprocessor, the PowerPC, was originally supported by 
Microsoft with its Windows NT operating system. As noted at the Hearing by Mr. Patterson, however, Microsoft has now "
567,," withdrawn its support for the PowerPC microprocessor, making it unavailable to manufacturers, such as Intergraph, who are 
committed to the Windows NT operating system. (Tr. 165-166)."
567,15," Intel submitted the affidavit of Keith Johnson, its Huntsville, Alabama, representative, in which he states that some other 
manufacturers produced microprocessors that are ""advertised to be comparable to"" Intel's Chips. (Johnson Aff. 14)."
567,16," There are, in fact, microprocessors on the market that are faster than any current version of the Pentium II. The Alpha 
microprocessor from Digital Equipment Company was the fastest CPU available as of the time of the Hearing, and there are 
others that are faster than the Intel products. None of these, however, are compatible with, and therefore usable, in the Pentium 
based workstations designed and manufactured by Intergraph. (Tr. 103-104). Not all of these CPUs are capable of running on 
the Windows NT operating system. See, for example, the PowerPC. Also, it is not mere operating speed that distinguishes the 
Pentium II. The Pentium II microprocessor also has the capability to handle the advanced graphics requirements of high-end 
workstations. In cross-examining Mr. Patterson, counsel for Intel implied that the Alpha CPU would be a potential alternative to 
Intel's products. While not a part of the evidence, counsel for Intergraph stated (Tr. 25), and the court is aware of reports in the 
media, that as a part of the settlement of litigation between Intel and Digital Equipment Company, Intel will acquire ownership 
and control of the Alpha chip. Thus, even if it were economically and technologically feasible for Intergraph to switch its products 
to the Alpha chip, it could still be forced into a customer/seller relationship with Intel."
567,17," Mr. Patterson testified that the new P6 Bus is not compatible with products available from others in the computer industry and 
that no one else in the industry is working on an alternative product that would be compatible with the P6 Bus. (Tr. 66, 70-71). 
Intel's lawyer suggested that Intel had licensed the rights to the P6 Bus to others, including IBM, implying that such licensees 
could soon produce a product that would be competitive with the Pentium II. (Tr. 109-10). Intel, however, introduced no evidence 
to support this suggestion. In any event, Mr. Patterson confirmed (on re-direct) that the mere license of rights to the P6 Bus does 
not solve the problem of lack of alternative products that confronts Intergraph (or others similarly situated). (Tr. 217-18). The 
court finds that Intel manufactures the only microprocessor with the necessary speed and graphics handling capabilities that also 
will ""fit"" the P6 Bus, the Bus that has been designed into and used on Intergraph's most recent mother boards. Furthermore, 
there was no evidence that IBM or any other chip maker could produce a P6 compatible CPU within a reasonable time or even 
that any chip maker might be inclined to invest the billions of dollars that would be required to duplicate the performance of 
Intel's latest products. "
568,18," Defendant, though admitting that there is no other CPU presently available that could give the plaintiff the performance it 
requires to be competitive in the high-end workstation market, suggested at the Hearing that Intergraph could easily substitute a 
different microprocessor for the Intel Pentium II. That contention is simply fantasy. The record refutes any such notion. In 
response to the court's question regarding a substitute CPU, Intel's counsel stated, ""If you are asking me does there exist a chip 
out there today that they could pull out the Intel chip and plug it in, I think the answer to that is no."" (Tr. 164). The simple fact is 
there is presently no practical substitute for the Pentium II, and if there were, it would be two years or more before Intergraph 
could design and produce the mother board and graphics subsystems necessary to use any such substitute. Even then, in the 
words of Intel's counsel, ""They [Intergraph] may be downgraded from first class to coach, but they haven't been told they can't 
get on the plane."" (Tr. 232). "
569,19," Intergraph has approximately 8,500 employees around the world, with approximately 4,500 of those being in Huntsville, 
Alabama. Its business is conducted through three divisions. The Intergraph Computer Systems Division handles all hardware 
activities for the company. The Intergraph Software Division creates and markets software applications for the engineering 
market. The Intergraph Federal Systems Division sells commercial systems to and provides consulting work for the federal 
government. (Tr. 72)."
569,20," A graphical interface allows the user to operate the system and applications software by using a cursor and screen image 
instead of using programming languages. (Meadlock Aff. 4)."
569,21," Mr. Patterson testified: Back in those early days, you didn't have enough horsepower that you could put it all in one box. So Intergraph made a business 
selling systems wrapped around Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputers and Intergraph designed a very high-end graphic 
termals [sic] to work with those. (Tr. 75)."
569,22," Mr. Patterson stated in testimony at the Hearing: Then in the mid 1980's, Intergraph decided that the horsepower that you would need to have an all in one solution was going to 
become available and so Intergraph used Fairchild's RISC microprocessor called Clipper and designed an all in one workstation 
for doing graphics and high-end work within that workstation. That was based on the Unix operating system, not on Windows. 
Windows wasn't around in those days. (Tr. 75)."
569,23," ""RISC"" is an acronym for ""Reduced Instruction Set Computer,"" a type of microprocessor designed for faster computers. 
Intergraph claims ownership to all of the patent rights to Clipper, including patent rights on advanced designs of Clipper, 
(Meadlock Aff. 7), though it should be noted that one or more of those patents are at issue in this case and in litigation now 
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In this litigation, Intergraph alleges that Intel has 
incorporated some of Intergraph's key Clipper technology into Intel's CPUs and infringes Clipper patents owned by Intergraph. 
See Counts 19-21 of Intergraph's First Amended Complaint. According to Intergraph, the internal architecture of Intel's Pentium 
CPUs incorporate RISC technology covered by the Clipper patents. (Tr. 159-160)."
569,24," By affidavit, James Meadlock testified: "
570,," In 1993, I personally met with Andy Grove of Intel to discuss Intel's future development plans. Mr. Grove represented to me that 
Intel's chips would soon have the necessary computing power and speed for the development of an Intergraph workstation. I 
also expressed my concern with Intel being the sole source supplier of its chips, but was assured by Mr. Grove that Intel was 
sensitive to such issues and that Intel treated all of its developers fairly and equally. Based upon such representations, the 
company began development of an Intel-based workstation and discontinued further development of the Clipper and Clipper-
based workstations and servers. (Meadlock Aff. 9). Mr. Meadlock acknowledged, however, that Mr. Grove did not commit Intel to provide a perpetual supply of 
chips, pre-released chips, or confidential information. (Tr. at 242-3.) Mr. Meadlock also acknowledged that Mr. Grove did not 
commit Intel to any continued or ""perpetual business relationship"" with Intergraph. (Tr. at 243.)"
570,25," On direct examination, Mr. Patterson was asked whether Intergraph could now return to its own Clipper based CPU 
technology, abandoning the Intel product. He answered, ""No. All the people [technical staff] are gone and we have not been 
developing Clipper now for about three years, so there is no way to start that up."" (Tr. 80)."
570,26," The court is aware that technology in the computer/workstation industry changes so rapidly that what is true today may not be 
true six months from now. Mr. Patterson stated in his affidavit, ""Due to ever-changing chip technology and market demand, 
Intergraph's workstations have an average market life of six months before the company must release its next generation 
product."" (Patterson Aff. 16). Today, Intel stands as the victor in the so-called ""platform war,"" dominating the competition 
between RISC-Unix workstations and Intel-Windows workstations. Currently Intel-Windows workstations outsell RISC-Unix by a 
ratio of about two to one. (Tr. 212-214). Projections of future market shares indicate sales of RISC-Unix products will remain flat 
while Intel-Windows workstations will grow very rapidly. (Id.). An industry research company, IDC, projects that Intel's share of 
technical workstations will surge to eighty-six percent by the year 2000. See Business Week, supra, p. 74. Nevertheless, the 
court is also aware of press reports that IBM will soon demonstrate a new microprocessor that it claims will be more powerful 
than Intel's Pentium II and will run at speeds of one gigahertz. Thus, assuming IBM can produce what it claims, to say that 
Intergraph has no alternative to Intel products now is not to say it will have no alternative in the future. The critical point is that it 
has no practical alternative to Intel products today."
570,27," That the Clipper technology held some potential for future innovation will be demonstrated if, as Intergraph contends in this 
lawsuit, Intel has indeed incorporated some of the Clipper RISC technology in the Pentium products. "
571,28," By affidavit, Mr. Patterson testified: Initially, most of the information necessary to develop products using Intel's chips was provided in product data books. Product 
data books were generally available from Intel or its distributors. However, as each subsequent generation of chips were made 
available, the technical information contained in the product data books became less comprehensive. Information which was no 
longer contained in product data books, but necessary for product development, was migrated into packets of confidential 
information commonly referred to as ""yellow books."" The information contained in yellow books was considered by Intel to be 
confidential information. Intel managed the supply of such yellow books, and the information disclosed therein, through the use 
of non-disclosure agreements. (Patterson Aff. 7)."
571,29," NDA 6: ""No Obligation of Disclosure. Neither party has any obligation to disclose Confidential Information to the other. Either 
party may, at any time, cease giving Confidential Information to the other party without any liability or request in writing the return 
of Confidential Information previously disclosed."""

of business association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products using or incorporating the Confidential 
Information, nor as creating an implied or express license grant from either party to the other."""
571,31," NDA 7: ""Termination and Duty to Return. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon notice to 
the other party. However, all obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement. In the event this 
Agreement is terminated, and the disclosing party so requests, the receiving party shall promptly return or destroy (and certify 
destruction of) all Confidential Information which is received from the disclosing party along with copies which it made."""
571,32," RUNDA 14(a): ""This Agreement is neither intended to nor shall it be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, or other 
form of business association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products or services using or incorporating 
Confidential Information."" (Johnson Aff. Exh. 3.) MERCED DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT 10: ""Neither party warrants that the information that it discloses is necessarily complete. 
Neither party undertakes to advise the other of any changes in its plans. Neither party shall be obligated to take into 
consideration any plans of the other or to design any of its products specially to accommodate the products of the other or to do 
business with the other in the future."" (Johnson Aff. Exh. 4.) "
572,33," Mr. Patterson stated by affidavit: As noted, the company has entered into numerous non-disclosure agreements with Intel, for a variety of products and 
information. The company has maintained the confidentiality of information supplied under such non-disclosure agreements. The 
company took reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of information supplied by Intel, to the satisfaction of Intel. 
The company has maintained such information in its restricted access facilities, and by only supplying such information to 
specifically named personnel who needed the information for development or support efforts. Intel has never accused Intergraph of violating, or disregarding, any non-disclosure agreement, or improperly disclosing such 
information. Nor has Intel ever complained to Intergraph about confidentiality or compliance issues pertaining to information 
supplied under a non-disclosure agreement. In fact, the first time Intel ever raised an issue about information provided under a 
non-disclosure agreement was after Intergraph refused to grant Intel royalty free rights under the company's Clipper patents. 
Specifically, I was advised by both Pat Gelsinger and Annand Chandreshaker, on four separate occasions, that Intel would not 
enter into any future non-disclosure agreements or supply any information normally provided under non-disclosure agreements, 
unless Intergraph conceded and granted Intel rights under its Clipper patents. Shortly thereafter, Intel first demanded the return 
of information under (sic) non-disclosure agreement. Even then Intel did not allege that we had failed to comply with the non-
disclosure agreements, rather that said they [sic] could unilaterally terminate for any reason at any time. (Patterson Aff. 11 and 12)."
572,34," Intel's validation partners enjoy a mutually beneficial, but transitory, relationship whereby an Intel customer participates in the 
developmental testing of a specific Intel product that would potentially be useful for integration into the customer's own product. 
(Johnson Aff. 11-12). As part of this relationship, the customer receives Intel confidential information with respect to the product, 
and sample products, before such information and products are available to others. (Johnson Aff. 11). Intergraph was a 
validation partner with respect to Intel's Pentium Pro processor, which has now been on the market for approximately two years. 
(Johnson Aff. 11). Intergraph has not been a validation partner for any subsequent Intel products. (Johnson Aff. 12)."
572,35," The entire text of Mr. Johnson's letter was as follows: This is to confirm Intel's intent of supporting Intergraph as a strategic customer in current and future programs. This support 
includes product supply, design, quality, manufacturing and marketing. "
573,," As a strategic customer, Intel is offering Intergraph the benefit of additional price reductions on all microprocessor products 
placed direct with Intel. Intel and Intergraph are currently involved in multiple programs efforts. I have outlined several below for 
your review."
573,1," . Pentium(R) Processor, Pentium(R) II Processor and Pentium Pro(R) Processor production programs."
573,2," . Pentium(R) Processor, Pentium(R) II Processor and Pentium Pro(R) Processor design programs."
573,3," . Development efforts with Intel's next generation microprocessor and chipset technology, i.e., Deschutes, Merced, etc. These 
are currently being managed under Non-Disclosure."
573,4," . Marketing involvement and new product introduction events. The Pentium(R) II Processor and Wired for Management efforts 
being the most recent. Intergraph is also active in the Intel Inside(R) Program. It is Intel's intent to assist Intergraph in its efforts whenever possible. These efforts are integral to our respective companies (sic) 
future success. Intel's goal is to lead the market in personal computer, workstation and server industry. We look forward to a mutually beneficial 
business relationship and appreciate Intergraph's continued support toward this goal. (Intergraph's Preliminary Injunction Motion Exh. 7)."
573,36," Intergraph filed this action on Monday, November 17, 1997, in this court. Within hours Intel filed an action in the Northern 
District of California seeking a declaratory judgment asserting that Intergraph's patents were invalid and that it had not infringed 
those patents. One week later, Intel filed a second action in the Northern District of California by which it claimed that Intergraph 
had breached its contract with Intel by refusing to return confidential information that had been provided under the canceled 
NDAs. On December 1, 1997, the court issued a temporary restraining order to prevent Intel from proceeding with the California 
law suits. That order was allowed to expire after Intel counsel represented to the court that Intel would not pursue the California 
actions pending resolution of its motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). That motion has been filed and briefed and is under 
consideration by the court. "
575,37," In his affidavit, Terry Phillips, Manager of Workstation Development for Intergraph for some three years, described the manner 
in which Intergraph and Intel had previously worked together: I have worked directly with Intel's technical support personnel to obtain advance technical information and ongoing development 
assistance for the development of Intergraph's workstations. I have also worked with Intel's technical support personnel to obtain 
information on Intel defects and corrections for Intel products incorporated into Intergraph's workstations. Additionally, I have 
worked with Intel's local representative in Huntsville, Keith Johnson, to obtain early releases of advance product samples for 
workstation development. All of which are necessary for continued development and support of Intergraph's workstations. Intel has supplied Intergraph with advance technology, product information and advance product samples since 1993 as an 
integral part of Intergraph's purchase of Intel chips. The technical information and advance product samples are essential for the 
incorporation of Intel's products into Intergraph workstations, ""debugging"" Intel's chips, and providing support to Intergraph 
customers. For instance, new shipments and revisions of microprocessors and chips generally contain new technical information 
made available under a non-disclosure agreement, including information on debugging and errata as such problems become 
known to Intel. Intel's products cannot be utilized without this essential product information, much of which was provided in years 
past to the general public in ""data books,"" but which now is parceled out through non-disclosure agreements. Intel supplied advance technical product information and support, as well as early releases of advance product samples until 
about August 1997. Since August, Intel has refused, or delayed, access to product information, defect and defect correction 
information, technical support and advance product samples. As a result, Intergraph has had to expend significant time and 
resources to work through development issues and delays caused by Intel's refusal to supply such necessary technical 
information and support. Further, Intergraph has been significantly delayed in releasing previously announced workstation 
products. If Intel is permitted to continue to withhold advance technical information and support, Intergraph will be unable to 
properly utilize the product obtained from Intel, and unable to correct defects in Intel's products or errors in Intergraph's designs 
based upon such defects. Intergraph cannot continue to develop competitive workstation products without a sustained supply of microprocessors, chips, 
early release product samples, and technical product information and support. Further, Intergraph cannot continue to support 
customers utilizing Intergraph's Intel-based workstations, without ongoing technical support and defect information and 
assistance. Without a sustained supply of microprocessors, chips, early release product samples, technical information and support, 
Intergraph will not be able to supply competitive workstation products or ongoing support, and will lose its significant 
technological lead, reputation and goodwill in the highly technical workstation market. (Phillips Aff. 4-8)."
575,38," The conduct of Intel in this dispute contrasts sharply with that of IBM. Mr. Patterson testified that Intergraph and IBM have 
been engaged in a continuing dispute over their respective patent rights. That dispute has apparently not risen to the level of 
litigation but, in any event, Intergraph and IBM continue an amicable and profitable business, each being a customer of the 
other. "
577,39," The evidence was that after Intel refused to provide Intergraph with technical data required to ""fix"" a bug in one of its 
processors, which prevented the computer from being turned off, Intergraph sought to purchase certain equipment from 
Tektronix, a manufacturer and provider of test machines, so that it might analyze and ""fix"" the bug without the aid of Intel. 
Because Intel had canceled its NDAs and three-way NDAs with Intergraph, Tektronix refused to sell the test equipment to 
Intergraph. (Tr. 204-06)."
577,40," BIOS is an acronym for Basic Input Output System. It is the most basic level of software which provides communications 
services between the CPU and other hardware components of a computer. "
578,41," The court is not impressed that withholding this readily available web site address was significant except to the extent that it 
demonstrates the level of Mr. Johnson's own animus toward Intergraph. His attitude may or may not reflect that of his superiors 
at Intel, though the court is impressed with the manner in which Intel apparently plays ""hard ball"" with those who cross it."
578,42," Because of the demand for Intel's newest generation CPUs, Intel operates an allocation system to control supply of CPUs to 
its customers. (Keith Johnson Aff. 16)."
578,43," See Section V.A. 1.e, infra, for discussion of ""returns to scale"" as a basis for finding the existence of monopoly power. "
579,44," In fact, the court takes judicial notice that Intel has released a 333 mhz. version since the Hearing. "
587,45," Notwithstanding the presence of open terms, the promises in the Letter Agreement are sufficiently definite to be enforceable.  
Thermal Sys. Of Ala. v. Sigafoose, 533 So. 2d 567, 571 (Ala. 1988); H.C. Schmieding Prod Co. v. Cagle, 529 So. 2d 243, 248 
(Ala. 1988). In cases such as this, the UCC's ""gap-filler"" provisions supply the open terms. See Ala. Code §§ 7-2-305 to 310. Intel has submitted a single NDA containing a California choice of law provision. However, the Letter Agreement originated in 
Huntsville, Alabama. Accordingly, Alabama law applies to the interpretation of this Agreement. In any event, California has 
adopted verbatim the same provisions of the Alabama Uniform Commercial Code discussed herein. Moreover, California 
commercial law is more favorable to Intergraph, as, unlike Alabama, it allows the UCC's obligation of ""good faith and fair dealing"" 
(Section 1-203) to stand alone as a cause of action. "
593,46," It is important to note that on a preliminary injunction determination, the quality of evidence is not restricted to what would be 
admissible at trial At this stage, Intel has had an opportunity to rebut, but has failed to rebut, the key evidentiary assertions made 
by Intergraph, and therefore, the court finds the quality of evidence submitted by Intergraph to be sufficient to support the 
findings herein. "

the motion for class certification pending resolution of the instant motions to dismiss. For the purpose of this motion to dismiss, 
the Court will consider only the Fund which is the named plaintiff. "
603,4," Plaintiff has abandoned its claims for violation of the Florida Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (Count VIII), strict liability 
(Count X), negligence (Count XI), and breach of express and implied warranties (Count XII). (See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s

(Fla. Cir. Ct. Dec. 13, 1996), rev. denied, 697 So. 2d 1249 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997) does not affect this Court's ruling. Judge 
Cohen's decision was based upon Florida's RICO act and upon the fact that the State did not have to meet the proximate cause 
requirements of a private litigant. "
607,6," The Florida legislature and courts have ""adopted as the law of Florida the body of antitrust law developed by the federal 
courts under the Sherman Act [because] statutory interpretation is of little help in ascertaining Sherman Act violations. Reliance 
must be upon the case law which over the years has, however broadly and sometimes inconsistently, laid out the parameters of 
conduct proscribed by those antitrust laws."" St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So. 2d 1028, 1032 
(Fla. 2d DCA 1984)"
607,7," Plaintiff's reliance on Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982) is misplaced. 
Contrary to plaintiff's assertions, Blue Shield did not involve a derivative claim. On the contrary, it involved a purchaser's claim 
against an antitrust offender. In this case, the Fund has not purchased any products from the defendants. Thus, its claim is 
wholly derivative. "
613,1," This ruling disposes of Plaintiffs' Motion In Limine To Preclude Evidence Or Argument Concerning Impact Or Fact Of Damage 
To The Class (Doc. # 661) filed February 4, 1998. "
614,2," In Brunswick, the Supreme Court noted that the injury ""should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation"" and that ""it should, in short, be 'the type of loss that the claimed violations . . 
. would be likely to cause.'"" 429 U.S. at 489 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 125, 23 L. 
Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969))."
614,3," In Cargill, the Supreme Court emphasized the necessity for scrutinizing the Brunswick antitrust injury factor and extended this 
requirement to cases such where plaintiffs sought an injunction under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. The Court 
held that in such a case, a private plaintiff is required to show threatened antitrust injury just as a plaintiff seeking damages 
under Section 4 of the Clayton Act is required to show actual antitrust injury.  479 U.S. at 113. The Court reaffirmed that an 
injury, although causally related to an antitrust violation, nevertheless does not qualify as ""antitrust injury"" unless it can be 
attributed to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny. The Court added that ""a showing of loss or damage due 
merely to increased competition does not constitute such injury."" 479 U.S. at 122."
614,4," As noted above, plaintiffs have already proven that the NCAA violated the antitrust laws. Under Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., supra, 395 U.S. at 114 n. 9, their burden of proving fact of damage under Section 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied 
by proof of ""some damage"" flowing from the unlawful conspiracy. "
615,5," Methods by which an antitrust plaintiff can establish lost profits include (1) comparing plaintiff's profits before or after the 
alleged anticompetitive activity with the profits made while plaintiff was subjected to the anticompetitive activity; (2) examining 
the profits of a business comparable to plaintiff's business which was not affected by the anticompetitive activity; and (3) 
projecting the market share which plaintiff would have attained absent the anticompetitive activity, and then projecting plaintiff's 
profits accordingly. ABA Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments (3d ed. 1992) at 411-13, 669-673, and cases cited "
616,," therein. In this case, plaintiffs have combined the ""before-and-after"" and ""yardstick"" approaches to project the compensation 
they would have attained absent the NCAA's anticompetitive activity. Methodologies of this kind have been cited with approval by numerous courts. See, e.g., In re South Central States Bakery 
Products Antitrust Litigation, 86 F.R.D. 407, 422 (M.D. La. 1980) (certifying class based on representations that impact of 
defendants' conspiracy could be shown by using at least one of four accepted methods, or a combination of these methods: 
comparing prices in different geographical regions, comparing prices and profits of conspirators versus non-conspirators, 
comparing prices in comparable markets, and comparing prices or profits before and after termination of the conspiracy); In re 
Domestic Air Transportation Antitrust Litigation, 137 F.R.D. 677, 689-90, 692 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (certifying 12.5 million

Antitrust Litigation, 80 F.R.D. 244, 251-52 (S.D. Tex. 1978) (class certified based on prediction that injury could be determined to 
a ""reasonable degree of certainty"" by ""either of two generally accepted methodologies""); In re Potash Antitrust Litigation, 159 
F.R.D. 682, 697-98 (D. Minn. 1995). "
617,6," Dr. Tollison's original Damage Report was dated February 3, 1997. He amended it on February 5 and February 20, 1997."
617,7," The NCAA's expert, John R. Umbeck, Ph.D., likewise authored a series of reports which reveal the scope of his research and 
intended testimony under Rule 26(a)(2)(B). See Expert Report (March 14, 1997), which critiqued the methodology proposed by 
Dr. Tollison's report of February 20, 1997; Affidavit of Dr. John R. Umbeck (February 2, 1998), which critiqued the methodology 
proposed by Dr. Tollison's report of January 19, 1998; and Expert Report (February 9, 1998). On March 4, Dr. Tollison responded to Dr. Umbeck's critiques. See Declaration of Robert D. Tollison (April 3, 1997). The battle 
of the experts raged on as Dr. Umbeck countered with a critique of Dr. Tollison's critique. See Supplemental Affidavit of Dr. John 
R. Umbeck (April 16, 1997). Dr. Tollison also filed an affidavit in opposition to the instant motions for summary judgment. See 
Declaration of Robert D. Tollison (January 19, 1998). "
618,8," Although the NCAA's seeks summary judgment regarding coaches for whom Dr. Tollison has prepared no analysis or 
individualized finding of damages, the ready answer is that plaintiffs do not seek damages for such coaches. The same is true 
for coaches for whom Dr. Tollison finds ""negative damages."" As to both categories, the NCAA's motion for partial summary 
judgment is moot. "
619,9," Likewise, the NCAA's argument with respect to coaches whose pay was determined by graduate tuition must fail. While the 
NCAA's argument on this issue is not clear, it apparently insists that for graduate assistant coaches, their compensation was 
determined not by the Rule, but by the amount of graduate tuition at their respective institutions. This is the proverbial distinction 
without a difference. The Rule set alternative caps for the academic year: $ 12,000 or the cost of graduate tuition at the 
institution in question. The graduate tuition cap did not exist independently of the Rule; it merely placed the salary cap at a 
different level. The NCAA's argument that ""there is no causal connection between the REC Rule and compensation to graduate 
assistant coaches"" cannot be intelligently followed."
619,11," By separate order, to which all parties have agreed, the Court determined that except for Doug Leichner, Greg Paradine and 
Brian Madeira, all individuals who were the subject of the NCAA's argument on summary judgment fall outside any relevant 
class. See Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. # 813) entered April 16, 1998. "
621,12," This holding disposes of the NCAA Motion In Limine Objecting To Evidence Of Damages Incurred After May 25, 1995 (Doc. # 
655) filed February 4, 1998."
621,13," The Court is in substantial agreement with the criticisms of Locklin that are articulated by Judge Easterbrook, dissenting in 
Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 582-84 (7th Cir. 1986). "
622,14," In itself, this ruling does not dispose of the NCAA Motion In Limine Objecting To Evidence Of Consumer Price Index 
Adjustment (Doc. # 655) filed February 4, 1998. On April 14, 1998, however, the Court conducted a brief evidentiary hearing 
outside the presence of the jury. At that time Dr. Tollison explained his calculations with respect to the CPI and how his CPI 
adjustment differs from interest. At the hearing, the parties agreed that plaintiffs' right to a CPI adjustment is an issue which is 
properly bifurcated and tried to the Court at an appropriate time after the jury trial on the issues of damages. Consequently, the 
Court will later determine whether the CPI adjustment is the functional equivalent of pre-judgment interest and is thus governed 
by 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). See Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 986 n. 20 (5th Cir. 1977). The NCAA's 
motion in limine is rendered moot by the parties' agreement to proceed in this manner. "

634,10," Exemption from the ""active supervision"" requirement is fortunate from the Board's perspective because its rulemaking process 
was not actively supervised. Despite the legislature's reservation of power to review the Board's proposals for new rules, rule 
changes can take effect without any active oversight by the legislature. LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 49:968 (West 1987 & Supp. 
1998). That is in fact what happened regarding the rules challenged in this case, and the situation is indistinguishable from the

exemption may be denied because the state statute authorizing the challenged conduct was cast in permissive language rather 
than mandatory language, the opinion has been overruled by numerous subsequent Supreme Court cases disavowing that 
reasoning. See, e.g., Southern Motor Carriers, 471 U.S. at 59-60. "
636,12," For example, the Board uses its state-granted monopoly power over the practice of public accounting to determine who may

residential unit shall utilize the waste collection services of the village, except as otherwise authorized in this chapter."""
684,2," Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint, which had named individual members of the Miami Shores Village Council as 
defendants, on March 21, 1997. Plaintiffs subsequently agreed to the voluntary dismissal of the individual defendants. On 
February 17, 1998, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which named only the Village as a defendant, and which added a 
claim for declaratory relief under state law regarding the applicability of the Ordinance to source-separated recovered materials 
as defined by state law. "
685,3," The parties do not dispute the fact that the Ordinance regulates interstate commerce, thus bringing the Ordinance ""within the 
purview of the Commerce Clause."" C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 389, 128 L. Ed. 2d 399, 114 S. Ct.

687,4," Plaintiffs note that the ordinance in USA Recycling involved generally applicable taxes, while Miami Shores charges user fees 
as a private waste processor would. However, the Town of Babylon also employed user fees for garbage generated beyond a 
fixed base amount. See USA Recycling, 66 F.3d at 1276, 1279. In any event, even if Miami Shores relies solely on user fees 
rather than taxes, the Ordinance does not discriminate against interstate commerce. "
688,5," Certain ""discretionary"" governmental functions are immune from tort liability. ""Discretionary"" acts are those involving ""an

701,1," United States District Judge Michael J. Davis dismissed a number of Plaintiffs' other claims in his September 29, 1995, Order 
ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss. The dismissed claims included: violation of Minnesota's Consumer Fraud Act, tortious 
interference with contractual and prospective business and economic relations, unfair competition under Minnesota law, breach 
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy."
701,2," Plaintiffs also alleged claims against attorney Theodore Grindal, who represented the Minnesota Society of Anesthesiologists. 
Judge Davis, however, dismissed all claims against Grindal in his September 29, 1995 Order. "
702,3," An official at the Health Care Financing Administration illustrated the difficulty of delineating a payment system for services 
rendered by CRNAs and/or MDAs: [HCFA] differentiated, for payment purposes between the services of CRNAs who are medically directed and the services 
of non-medically directed CRNAs, that is CRNAs working without being directed by an anesthesiologist. One issue HCFA 
had to address in these regulations was how to pay CRNAs where concurrent procedures aren't involved but both a CRNA 
and an anesthesiologist are involved in a single procedure. Both the proposed regulation . . . and the final regulation . . . 
included a regulatory provision that advised CRNAs that, if an anesthesiologist and a CRNA are both involved in a single 
anesthesia service, for purposes of determining whether to pay the CRNA, we would deem the service to have been 
personally performed by the anesthesiologist. In such cases, we also allow payment of the CRNA if the CRNA furnishes 
documentation to the carrier explaining the medical necessity for two anesthesia providers. Stone Aff., Ex. 280 (letter to David S. Stone from the HCFA). "
703,4," The record suggests that administrators at Unity/Mercy began to consider terminating the CRNAs in early 1993. Stone Aff., 
Exs. 292, 295, 212."
703,5," Hospital administrators at St. Cloud Hospital made the decision to terminate CRNAs and reorganize the anesthesia department 
in the fall of 1993. The hospital, however, did not complete its transition to sole-source contracting until November 1994. "
705,6," Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Jerry Cromwell, draws vague conclusions and speculates about the impact of the termination of the 
CRNAs. On the issue of antitrust injury, the Cromwell report does not offer empirical evidence similar to that of Defendants' 
expert, Dr. William Lynk. As a result, it does not effectively refute the findings of Dr. Lynk. "
706,7," Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in conscious parallelism in an effort to eliminate CRNAs as competitors. The 
allegations of parallel behavior include the following: ""Defendant MDAs secretly approached the Defendant hospitals to 
terminate their CRNA employees and later lied about the communications to make it appear the hospitals had independently 
decided to do so;"" ""both hospitals used operations improvement-type vehicles as a smoke screen to terminate the CRNAs;"" 
""both hospitals claims [sic] that they terminated the CRNAs because they were losing money even though the facts demonstrate 
that CRNAs were profitable;"" ""both hospitals used severance as a carrot and a stick to force CRNAs to work for the MDAs;"" 
""both hospitals refused to meet with CRNAs individually or jointly;"" ""both hospitals excluded CRNAs from the restructuring 
process;"" ""both MDA groups refused to allow CRNAs to see their contracts with the hospital prior to being employed by the 
MDAs . . .;"" ""both MDA groups hired Ted Grindal and his firm to represent them . . .;"" ""both hospitals and MDAs negotiated 
indemnifications from the hospitals to the MDAs to pay their legal fees . . .;"" ""both hospitals threatened to bring in the same . . . 
national temporary anesthesia services agency . . .;"" ""the MDAs at both hospitals made similar statements to the effect that

706,8," An oligopoly is a market containing only a few sellers, in which all sellers recognize that they are primarily interdependent. 
Consequently, an oligopolist seller will likely account for its competitor's reactions in determining output and prices. VI Areeda, § 
1410b at 65. "
707,9, See supra note 6 (listing allegedly collusive or parallel conduct). 
709,10," Plaintiffs cite to successive pages in their memorandum in support of this proposition. The cited pages, however, do not 
contain any significant evidence of an increase in the price of anesthesia. Moreover, Plaintiffs' memorandum is not evidence 
properly before the Court."
709,11," Plaintiffs assert, through the affidavit of Ladonna Schweer, that the quality of anesthesia services has declined at the 
Defendant hospitals since the termination of CRNAs as direct hospital employees. Schweer's affidavit recites inadmissible 
hearsay from another employee ""that, based on her personal observations since the CRNAs at Unity and Mercy were terminated 
as employees of the hospital, the quality of care in those hospitals has decreased rather than increased."" Stone Aff., Ex. 14, at 2. 
Moreover, the notes purportedly offered in support of these conclusory statements merely contain critiques of recent services. 
Without any reference to prior delivery of services, the notes are not probative of any increase or decrease in the quality of care."
709,12," Plaintiffs attempt to address the labor markets for both CRNAs and MDAs. Plaintiffs' expert, however, concedes that ""the 
defendant hospitals have no power to alter the national average income of anesthesiologists."" Cromwell Rebuttal Report, at 3-4. "
710,13," Because anesthesia is provided attendant to surgery, surgical statistics may be used as a proxy indicating the proportion of 
anesthetics provided at a given hospital."
710,14," Plaintiffs rely on Oltz v. St. Peter's Community Hospital, 861 F.2d 1440 (9th Cir. 1988) in support of their antitrust claims. Oltz, 
however, is distinguishable because the defendants in that case had an 84% market share. Also, the plaintiff CRNA in Oltz was 
prevented from delivering any anesthesia services, unlike Plaintiffs in the present case. "
711,15," Dr. Cromwell opines: Allina's market share of inpatient and ambulatory surgery for its five hospitals (excluding St. Francis but including Phillips 
Eye) was 32.84, almost exactly what Dr. Lynk estimated. However, the three hospitals in the Healtheast system enjoyed a 
9.4% market share while the four hospitals in the Fairview system (including the University of Minnesota) enjoyed a 27.7% 
share. This leaves four independents: North Memorial, Methodist, St. Paul-Ramsey, and Hennepin County. The overall 
Herfindahl Index for the four independents and the three systems was 2116, above the threshold for antitrust concerns by 
the Justice Department. The three systems, alone, generated a Herfindahl Index value of 1935, a value exceeding the 
Justice Department's threshold. Coupled with the fact that Mercy & Unity Hospitals have a special geographic niche on the 
northeast side of the Mississippi River, these index values certainly raise anti-competitive concerns. Cromwell Rebuttal Report, at 16. This is the only evidence proffered by Dr. Cromwell that attempts to quantify market share in 
the context of the Allina system. It appears, however, that Dr. Cromwell merely aggregates hospitals or systems when it is 
advantageous to do so. "
712,16," Although in Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. 2, 21, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984), the Court held that markets for 
anesthesia services and surgical services were sufficiently distinct to allege an illegal tying arrangement, the Court also 
recognized that this alone did not make an exclusive contract illegal and that there was nothing inherently illegal about packaged 
sales.  466 U.S. at 24-25. "
719,1," Dr. Ezekwo has maintained a practice in internal medicine since 1983. She became licensed in opthamology in 1988. As of 
April 1993, she represented that she held admitting privileges at Beth Israel Medical Center hospitals, Our Lady of Mercy 
Medical Center (233rd Street and Pelham Divisions) and Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. "

] One ""who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"" may receive treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.  15 U.S.C. § 15(a). Section 16 provides for injunctive relief. 15 
U.S.C. § 26. Due to the fact that Dr. Ezekwo passed the certifying examination in August 1997, the injunctive relief sought against the 
certifying organization is now moot."
720,3," To receive the Board's certification, a doctor must complete three years of post-graduate training in internal medicine and pass 
the two-day written exam that the Board administers."
720,4," The Board has been certifying internists for over 50 years, and is, indeed, the only such certifying body in the field of internal 
medicine."
720,5," The Board's examination is machine-scored in the first instance. Under the Board's review procedures, if a candidate for 
certification believes the exam to be erroneously scored, he or she can request hand scoring. If a candidate fails the exam more 
than two times, he or she can go over the exam with a Board officer."
720,6," Montefiore's Medical Staff By-Laws delineate the process for obtaining voluntary attending privileges as well as full-time staff 
admitting privileges. The hospital is divided into clinical departments that correspond to areas of medical and surgical practice. 
The by-laws provide that each department is responsible for establishing its own criteria for the grant of clinical privileges. The "
721,," applications receive a three-tiered evaluation, by (1) the Promotion and Appointment Committee, (2) the relevant Department 
Chair, and (3) the pertinent divisional Credential Committee of the Medical Staff. The Department of Medicine then reviews each 
application, the accompanying letters of recommendation, and interviews the applicant. Finally, the Medical Staff Executive 
Committee makes a recommendation to Montefiore's Board of Trustees as to whether privileges should be extended to the 
applicant."
721,7," Montefiore is a voluntary tertiary care teaching hospital, affiliated with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva 
University."
721,8," Exceptions are made for certain doctors with whom the hospital has a prior history or regarding whom the hospital has 
established knowledge of competence and quality of care; i.e., recent graduates from resident training and nationally renowned 
researchers, as well as doctors who have been on the medical staff for years."
721,9," Under Montefiore's Medical Staff By-Laws, an applicant has numerous opportunities for hearing and appeal of adverse 
recommendations. The by-laws provide that an applicant can appeal the Executive Committee's recommendation prior to that 
recommendation being relayed to the Board of Trustees. If appeal is taken, the applicant can request a hearing before the Ad 
Hoc Hearing Committee of the Executive Committee, where the applicant can submit further documentation, examine and cross-
examine witnesses, and be represented by counsel. After that hearing, the Ad Hoc Hearing Committee makes a written 
recommendation to the Executive Committee, which then issues another recommendation for the Board of Trustees. Within 
fifteen days of that issuance, the applicant may request another appeal if still dissatisfied with the outcome. The second appeal 
takes place strictly on the record, as reviewed by either the Board of Trustees or a committee thereof, although the applicant 
does have the right to request oral argument at this stage. If a committee of the Board of Trustees makes the review, it then 
issues a recommendation to the Board as a whole. The Board as a whole can accept or reverse the prior recommendation, or 
send it back to the Executive Committee for further consideration or amend the recommendation itself. In any event, the Board's 
determination is a final one."
721,10," See, id."
721,11," There were occasions, however, where Montefiore received communications from a Joseph Fleming, Esq., who described 
himself as Dr. Ezekwo's attorney. "
722,12, The hearing's record included over 700 transcript pages and 200 exhibits.
722,13," At the same time, the Hearing Committee addressed Dr. Ezekwo's claims that Montefiore had acted improperly and in bad 
faith, basing its denial on racial or gender or religious discrimination, and that Dr. Ezekwo's failure at board certification was 
somehow orchestrated by hospital personnel in fear of competition from her managed care practice. The Hearing Committee 
found the claims conclusory and without basis."
722,14," Pursuant to the by-laws, this second review was strictly of the record, although Dr. Ezekwo was informed that she could 
request oral argument and did not do so. See, supra, note 10."
722,15," Beyond Montefiore's procedures and review regarding Dr. Ezekwo's admitting privileges, the matter has received thorough 
review as well from the Public Health Council of New York State (the Council) as well as the New York State Division of Human 
Rights (DHR). In September 1993, Dr. Ezekwo filed a complaint against Montefiore with the Council under Public Health Law § 
2801-b. That filing was deemed premature given that the Montefiore's appellate procedures were pending. Dr. Ezekwo filed 
again, subsequent to Montefiore's final determination, on November 11, 1995. As of the time of argument and briefing, the 
Council had not issued its final determination. As to the DHR investigation, Dr. Ezekwo's complaint against Montefiore was 
dismissed with a finding of no probable cause to believe the discrimination alleged had occurred."
722,16," Evidently, the BHP offices are in the same building facility as Montefiore Medical Center Clinic. Montefiore was one of the 
hospitals with which BHP contracted at that time, the others being Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center and Barnabas Hospital."
722,17," On January 18, 1993, Dr. Ezekwo wrote to BHP requesting information on BHP's health plan, ""so that [she] could start 
participating immediately."" BHP responded on February 1, 1993, that the Plan had no need at that time for additional 
opthamologists. Dr. Ezekwo replied on February 15, 1993, accusing BHP of discrimination and ""anti fair business"" and 
threatening litigation. Separately, on the same date, Dr. Ezekwo requested an investigation by the New York State Insurance 
Commissioner. (After making inquiries on April 4, 1993, the Commissioner's office did not pursue the matter. After a further 
communication from Dr. Ezekwo's counsel on February 25, 1995, BHP responded that is would not consider Dr. Ezekwo's 
queries and applications in the area of opthamology or internal medicine, and clarified its position as to why. "

732,1," Lowe was overturned on other grounds by NAACP v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 287, 297 (7th Cir. 1992). The 
district court determined that the American Family decision left Lowe's holding that premium financing involved the ""business of 
insurance"" untouched. "
733,2, This description reflects how the parties have framed the issue for review. We conceptualize the inquiry differently. See infra. 
736,3," We recognize that our formulation today differs from the one used in American Deposit Corp. v. Schacht, 84 F.3d 834, 838 (7th 
Cir. 1996), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 136 L. Ed. 2d 123, 117 S. Ct. 185 (1996). In Schacht we first addressed whether the state 
statute was ""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."" After answering that question in the 
affirmative, we asked whether the particular activity at issue in the case was part of the ""business of insurance."" No doubt we 
took this second step because Fabe counsels that a statute ""need not be treated as a package which stands or falls in its 
entirety,"" Fabe, 508 U.S. at 509 n.8, and instead that a state statute should only displace federal law ""to the extent that it 
regulates policyholders,"" id. at 508. Because we find that the Illinois statute regulating premium financing agreements is not one 
""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,"" we need go no further. "
737,4," In their brief, the defendants refer to several statutes within Article XXXII of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. Article XXXII is 
entitled ""Premium Finance Companies,"" and the statutes within it regulate all manner of things related to such companies. 
However, the only state statute at issue in this case is 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/513a9, the statute relating to premium finance 
agreements. Specifically, the only sections at issue are subsections (a) and (b) of § 513a9. The question we must address is 
whether § 513a9 is a law ""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."" Examining other state statutes, 
even if such statutes are located in the same section of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, would not assist our inquiry and we 
therefore decline to do so."
737,5," We confess some uncertainty as to whether Fabe counsels us to employ the Pireno test in cases involving the first clause of § 
2(b) to determine whether a statute is one ""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."" Although the 
Court distinguished Pireno as applying to cases involving the antitrust exemption, it employed a Pireno analysis in its discussion. "
738,," Many other courts have struggled with the same question. See, e.g., Ambrose, 891 F. Supp. at 1160. We do not understand 
Fabe to require the Pireno analysis in this situation. We read the Fabe Court's Pireno analysis as responding to the petitioner's 
argument that the appropriate question was whether the liquidation of an insolvent insurance company is part of the ""business of 
insurance."" By interpreting the statute as not merely ranking creditor priority in bankruptcy, but as affecting the actual 
performance of the insurance contract, the Supreme Court established that even under Pireno the statute was one ""enacted . . . 
for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."" Thus the Supreme Court defeated the petitioner's argument on its own 
ground. Understanding the Court's Pireno analysis in this context, we conclude that the Pireno analysis is not a necessary part 
of determining whether a statute is ""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."" This understanding 
comports with the Fabe Court's statement that: Both Royal Drug and Pireno . . . involved the scope of the antitrust immunity located in the second clause of § 2(b). We 
deal here with the first clause, which is not so narrowly circumscribed. The language of § 2(b) is unambiguous: The first 
clause commits laws ""enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance"" to the States, while the second 
clause exempts only ""the business of insurance"" itself from the antitrust laws. To equate laws ""enacted . . . for the purpose 
of regulating the business of insurance"" with the ""business of insurance"" itself, as petitioner urges us to do, would be to 
read words out of the statute. This we refuse to do. Fabe, 508 U.S. at 504. Additionally, the Pireno criteria focus on the activity regulated by the statute. Since we have previously 
determined that our focus is not on the activity itself, the Pireno factors provide too narrow a test. Accord Ambrose, 891 F. Supp. 
at 1160-61 & n.5 (""To the extent that Pireno and Royal Drug consider whether the practice being regulated is itself the business 
of insurance, their analysis is inapplicable in a case controlled by the broader first clause of Section 2(b).""). "
748,1," The Louisiana statute is closely analogous to this federal statute. See, 15 U.S.C. § 13. "
760,1," Although Giampolo believes that he was receiving a disproportionately high percentage of indigent patients because his 
medical colleagues were referring those with insurance to another facility, he has adduced no evidence to support his subjective 
impression, except for a letter he himself wrote to the hospital's Board of Directors. See dkt. no. 143, exh. 7 to exh. C. That letter 
cites nothing in support of its assertion."
760,2," Giampolo brought his attorney to an October 1993 meeting of the Medical Executive Committee to explain his position, id. at 
115-16, 119-20, 541-44, 738-39. "
761,3," I will deny the motion for discovery sanctions as moot. Defendants have sought only two forms of relief, both in the form of 
proposed jury instructions: (1) that making surreptitious tape recordings is a felony under the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and 
Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. C.S.A. § 5701 et seq.; and (2) that the trier of fact may infer that, had those 
recordings been produced, they would have been unfavorable to plaintiff. Dkt. no. 131, at 5-6. While it is inexcusable that 
Giampolo has failed to obey this court's order and produce either the tapes or a satisfactory explanation of what happened to 
them, my dismissal of this case on motions for summary judgment makes defendant's proposed relief moot. "
763,4," I therefore need not decide whether plaintiff is the most ""efficient enforcer"" of the antitrust laws, which deals with the situation in 
which ""[a] party may have suffered antitrust injury yet not be considered a proper plaintiff for other reasons."" Alberta Gas, 826 
F.2d at 1240. In the cases cited by defendants, efficient enforcer status was denied because other parties, such as health 
insurers, were better positioned to assert that costs had increased and caused them damage, even though the physician-plaintiff 
also suffered loss. See Baglio, 940 F. Supp. at 830 (citing Huhta, 1994 WL 245454 at *2; Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 
F.2d 1438, 1455 (11th Cir.1991). Here, defendants' policy of no longer referring all EMGs to Giampolo for an interpretation, if 
anything, reduced costs to patients and the payor community. Because these groups would have no incentive to file an antitrust 
suit, it appears that plaintiff would be the most efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws. The fact that only Giampolo suffered a 
pecuniary injury, however, further underscores the conclusion that that injury was to him alone, and not to competition. "
764,5," Giampolo cites to Eddy's testimony, in which he states that he heard that there was some kind of boycott going on against 
Giampolo: Q. Did you have a conversation with [Giampolo's secretary] where you indicated that Dr. Giampolo was being boycotted? A. Yes. Q. Could you tell us about that discussion? A. Again, it goes back to the information I had given you before about in conversations with other physicians, them relaying 
to me some of their concerns about him and his practice, and the discussion with [Giampolo's secretary] specifically had to 
do with the fact that her numbers were starting to drop off. Q. Did you use the term boycott? A. I can't tell you if I used that word or not. All I know is that the physicians were sending neurological patients outside of 
this area. Eddy dep. 109-10. Eddy does not attribute these statements to any of the defendants under which they could be admitted as the 
admission of a party opponent under Fed R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), or as the statement of a coconspirator of a party during the 
course and in furtherance of the conspiracy under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Accordingly, the statements are hearsay not within 
any exception, and are hence inadmissible evidence.  Kerth, 989 F. Supp. at 704 (citing Hlinka v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 863 
F.2d 279, 282 (3d Cir. 1988)). "
765,6," Giampolo also cites evidence that his patient referral practices were a topic of discussion among the medical staff, Eddy dep. 
51-52, that some physicians were referring their patients outside the county, id. at 108-10, and that Dr. Trenton was aware that 
certain physicians, such as Dr. deVries, chose not to give referrals to Giampolo, Trenton dep. 56-57. None of this evidence 
points to the existence of any concerted action by the defendants."
765,7," By this, I do not imply in any way that his motive was less than proper. Indeed, the record indicates that he was practicing 
neurology in Somerset, albeit on a part-time basis, before Giampolo was recruited. Catalano dep. 9-10."
765,8," Giampolo has moved to supplement the record with the recently taken affidavit of Grace Walsh, one of his patients. See dkt. 
no. 159. Ms. Walsh states that on or about July 1, 1996 she was examined by Dr. Jawad Salameh, a new general practitioner in 
Somerset. When she mentioned that she was also treating with Giampolo, Salameh told her that he would not continue to be her 
doctor unless she ended her patient-physician relationship with Giampolo. I will deny the motion. First of all, contrary to the 
representation made in the motion, id. P 5, plaintiff did not ""only recently become aware that Ms. Walsh possessed the 
information set forth in her March 10, 1998 affidavit."" Rather, Giampolo's own deposition of January 21, 1997, indicates his full 
knowledge of this incident at that time. See dkt. no. 160, exh. A. Thus, this matter could have been raised in Giampolo's brief in 
opposition to the motions for summary judgment. In response, Giampolo makes the frivolous argument that, while the nature of 
Ms. Walsh's testimony was known earlier, the affidavit only came into existence in March 1998; thus, the affidavit is newly 
discovered evidence. See dkt. no. 161 P 3. That simply proves too much: any party could wait until after summary judgment 
motions are filed and supplement the record on that rationale. "
766,," In any event, Ms. Walsh's affidavit proves nothing. Dr. Salameh is not a defendant in this case, and there is no evidence that 
suggests that any defendant induced him to malign Giampolo or that Salameh's actions were anything other than unilateral. 
Indeed, Giampolo testified that Ms. Walsh told him only that Dr. Salameh disagreed with Giampolo's medical diagnosis of her 
condition, and that Ms. Walsh continues to be Giampolo's patient. Dkt. no. 160, Exh. A."
766,9," Giampolo also asserts a cause of action under state antitrust law. It is not clear from the complaint, however, precisely what 
relief he seeks or where he demands it. In any event, his sole argument in opposition to summary judgment is that, if the federal 
antitrust claim survives, the state claim does as well. Dkt. no. 142, at 46. Because I am dismissing Giampolo's federal claims, I 
will also dismiss his state antitrust cause of action, with prejudice. "
767,10," Giampolo's § 2 claim lacks merit in any event. He simply has not shown that the hospital or the physician defendants, singly or 
in combination, possess any significant market power over neurology services in Somerset. See, e.g., Pontius v. Children's 
Hosp., 552 F. Supp. 1352, 1376-77 (W.D. Pa. 1982) (market power required to make out § 2 claim) (citing cases). None of these 
defendants competes with Giampolo, and the hospital has done nothing to restrict staff privileges or otherwise limit the number 
of neurologists who can practice in that region (with the possible exception of the exclusivity agreement which benefitted only 
Giampolo). Thus, it cannot seriously be maintained that defendants monopolized, or attempted to monopolize, the market."
767,11," His position, of course, is that the latter definition should prevail, as this would forbid the hospital from obtaining Eddy's 
impressions instead of Giampolo's medical interpretations. "
768,12," Giampolo contends, however, that this interpretation should be rejected because it renders the contract illusory or 
meaningless, relying on Jamison v. Concepts Plus, Inc., 380 Pa. Super. 431, 552 A.2d 265 (Pa. Super. 1988). This reliance is 
misplaced. Jamison involved, not a requirements contract, but a contract for the sale of land under which the buyer was 
responsible for obtaining permits to subdivide it.  552 A.2d at 266. If approval could not be obtained, the down payment was to 
be returned with interest. Id. The buyer, however, failed to pursue the subdivision application with diligence and sued to recover 
his money. Id. at 266-67. The court, to avoid a situation in which the entire contract would fail for want of consideration because 
the buyer obligated himself to nothing, interpreted the contract to require return of the down payment only if it was objectively 
impossible to obtain approval of the subdivision plan and ruled for the defendant. The Jamison court did not hold that a 
requirements contract like this one fails for lack of mutuality."
768,13," Giampolo asserts that bad faith can be found from the fact that ""the Hospital has not simply 'refrained' from requiring all EMGs 
to be interpreted: it has prohibited physicians practicing at Somerset Hospital from directing that EMG results be provided to Dr. 
Giampolo. . . ."" Dkt. no.142, at 15 (emphasis added). No citation to the record accompanies this allegation, nor does my review 
of the record support it. Hence, I will ignore it as an unsubstantiated, self-serving assertion."
768,14," Even if I accepted this argument, Giampolo might quickly find himself hoisted by his own petard. Giampolo, after all, performed 
EMG interpretations for indigent patients for some period of time; thus, it could well be argued that he believed that treating the 
indigent was one of his contractual obligations, which he breached when he began demanding payment in advance. Given that a "
769,," significant portion of the hospital's patients are indigent, Giampolo's ""breach"" would likely be deemed material, excusing the 
hospital from the exclusivity provision entirely."
769,15," As a means of avoiding summary judgment, this is a questionable tactic. See Fort Washington Resources, Inc. v. Tannen, 846 
F. Supp. 354, 364 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (""Plaintiff cannot now expand its claim beyond its pleadings simply to avoid a motion for 
summary judgment.""). Nevertheless, I will analyze plaintiff's argument on the existing contractual relations claim on the merits. "
770,16," Interestingly, these events allegedly occurred almost eighteen months after the First Amended complaint was filed."
770,17," See dkt. no. 146, at 5 & n. 2. Dr. Catalano initially made this representation in his reply brief, unaccompanied by a citation to 
the record or an affidavit. He promised that a corresponding affidavit would be filed ""shortly after Dr. Catalano's return from 
vacation[,]"" id., and indeed, that affidavit was filed on January 26, 1998. Giampolo does not dispute in his surreply brief that he 
was unavailable on these dates, see dkt. no. 149, choosing instead to move that the affidavit be stricken as untimely, or, in the 
alternative, to redepose Dr. Catalano. See dkt. no. 157. I will deny that motion. Giampolo raised these allegations against Dr. 
Catalano for the first time in his brief in opposition to summary judgment. It is only equitable to permit Dr. Catalano to submit an 
affidavit refuting Giampolo's newly raised theory of liability. Nor does Giampolo have a legitimate need to redepose Dr. Catalano, 
as he had every opportunity to ask the doctor earlier whether he had performed any interpretive procedures at the hospital or, 
alternatively, to move to re-open deposition discovery at the time he first became aware of the medical records of these patients. "
771,18," Giampolo contended that Catalano also interpreted a third electrodiagnostic test in violation of the exclusivity agreement. The 
evidence in support of that contention, however, consists of several pre-printed forms captioned ""SOMERSET HOSPITAL 
PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS"" which include a directive by an attending physician whose name is illegible that a patient was to make 
an appointment to be seen by Dr. Catalano. This evidence fails to establish that Dr. Catalano either saw this patient, a fact he 
denies, or interpreted any electrodiagnostic test performed on this patient. See dkt. no. 143, n. 16"
771,19," Those claims lack merit in any event. Giampolo admitted that he ceased treating indigent patients in his office, Giampolo dep. 
82, making any statement to that effect true and nondefamatory as a matter of law. See Badami v. Dimson, 226 Pa. Super. 75, 
310 A.2d 298, 299-300 (Pa. Super. 1973). At his deposition, Giampolo further identified alleged defamatory remarks made by 
Doctors Nair and Trenton. These remarks, however, expressed professional differences of opinion regarding patient treatment 
and hospital policy. They did not imply that Giampolo was not a competent physician, but only that these defendants had 
different philosophies regarding what type of information should appear on a neurologist's medical report, what procedures were "
772,," appropriate to perform at Somerset Hospital, and whether certain patients actually suffered from the conditions that Giampolo 
diagnosed. As statements of opinion, they were not defamatory as a matter of law. See Parano v. O'Connor, 433 Pa. Super. 
570, 641 A.2d 607, 609 (Pa. Super. 1994); Gordon v. Lancaster Osteopathic Hosp., 340 Pa. Super. 253, 489 A.2d 1364, 1369 
(Pa. Super. 1985). "
776,1," Although Defendant refers to one of the instant cases, Civ. No. 97-880, as Porous IV, Plaintiff appears to refer to Civ. No. 97-
880 as Porous III. Plaintiff adds to the confusion by referring to Porous III as Civ. No. 97-800. Similarly, Defendant refers to Civ. 
No. 97-2084 as Porous V, and Plaintiff refers to that case as Porous IV. To avoid further confusion, the Court will refer to the 
pending cases by the appropriate docket number. "
777,2," Porous also argues that Judge Davis' denial of Pall's post trial motions indicates that the counterclaims were baseless. The 
mere fact that Judge Davis found there was insufficient evidence to grant Pall's post-trial Rule 50(a) motions, does not suggest 
that the counterclaims were meritless and should not have been brought. As Pall argues, however, Judge Davis' denial of 
Porous' motion for judgment as a matter of law does indicate that there was sufficient evidence for those claims to go to the jury. "
778,3," Among the cases cited by Porous, one case involves Rule 11 sanctions, which makes it distinguishable from the case at hand. 
Other cases involve lower court opinions in other jurisdictions. "

807,14," This element of the standing test is the ""antitrust injury"" requirement."
807,15," As many commentators and courts have noted, the questions of antitrust injury and antitrust standing are difficult to 
disentangle. We believe that, similarly, in the present case, there is no bright line distinction between the two concepts. See,

808,16," In Brunswick, several smaller operators of bowling alleys sued a larger operator who was also a bowling equipment 
manufacturer. According to the plaintiffs, Brunswick's activity of acquiring failing alleys and providing cash to keep them afloat 
violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act. They argued this continued competition reduced their profits. Using the test set forth 
above, the Supreme Court held these lost profits did not constitute ""antitrust injury."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489."
808,17," In its complaint, the City alleged that it was bringing this action ""on its own behalf as a purchaser of electric utility service"" and 
""on behalf of its citizens and to protect the economy of Pittsburgh."" Compl. P 4. Defendants contest the City's ability to bring this 
action on behalf of its citizens. It is, however, uncontested that the City will be a purchaser of electricity -- for streets, public 
works, and other infrastructure -- in the Redevelopment Zones though it is not now a purchaser in these areas. "
809,18," Paragraphs 9 & 10 of the City's complaint contain nearly identical statements regarding the business of each utility, but 
contains no averment that the two companies compete. Elsewhere in the complaint, harm to competition is averred in broad, 
conclusory terms. See Compl. P 66."
809,19," The City has not explicitly argued this case under a ""potential competition"" theory and therefore we will not address that issue 
here. We do note, however, that the cases articulating this theory would be of doubtful support to the City. See, e.g. , United 
States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 651, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12, 84 S. Ct. 1044 (1964); United States v. Falstaff Brewing

810,20," HN26[
] The proper measure of damages for a price-fixing violation under the Sherman Act is the difference between the 
prices actually paid and those that would have been paid absent the conspiracy. See, e.g., State of N.Y. v. Hendrickson Bros., 
Inc., 840 F.2d 1065, 1077 (2d Cir. 1988); see also Robert Blair & William Page, ""Speculative"" Antitrust Damages, 70 Wash. L. 
Rev. 423, 426 (1995) (Plaintiff must project a ""hypothetical or 'but-for' condition that excludes only the effects of the defendant's 
illegal conduct."" Damages are measured by ""the difference between that projected condition and the plaintiff's actual 
condition.""). The injury alleged by the City here is purportedly separate from the injury of having to pay higher prices for electric 
service. In fact, the language of this claim merely underscores the fact that no competition existed between the two utilities. 
When a market participant expends resources to encourage competition, the participant risks that such expenditure will not 
result in lower prices. Despite this risk, the City chose to pursue its ""efforts"" with Allegheny Power. "
811,21," Further, this decision does not affect the City's ability to proceed in state court on its state law claims for restraint of trade, civil 
conspiracy, breach of contract, tortious interference, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and detrimental reliance. "
812,1," We accept all of the City's allegations as true in reviewing the motion to dismiss. Fuentes v. South Hills Cardiology, 946 F.2d 
196, 201 (3d Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). "
813,2," The majority, however, argues ""now that all parties, including the City, have withdrawn from the regulatory proceedings, an 
injunction would not alter the City's current situation."" In essence, the majority argues that because the City withdrew from the 
PUC proceedings, the issue is moot as to whether an injunction should be granted. However, once Allegheny withdrew its 
application, there was no point for the City to continue with its application. As the appellees point out themselves, Allegheny had 
to obtain approval from the PUC to enlarge its certificate of convenience. See Makovsky Bros., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility 
Comm., 55 Pa. Commw. 435, 423 A.2d 1089, 1092 (Pa. Commw. 1980). The City alone, as the consumer, could not petition the 
PUC to obtain lower utility prices.  Lukens Steel Co. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm., 92 Pa. Commw. 530, 499 A.2d 1134, 
1140 (Pa. Commw. 1985). Thus, once Allegheny withdrew, under Pennsylvania law, there was no point for the City to continue 
with its application. Instead, the City filed suit in federal district court. Although the law is changing in Pennsylvania as utility 
competition becomes a reality, there is no indication that the City could have proceeded ex parte before the PUC to ensure that 
Allegheny provide lower electricity rates."
813,3," Certainly the amount of damages that the City might recover may be limited by the fact that the PUC would not have approved 
the application, but this fact goes to the amount of damages that can be recovered rather than whether an antitrust violation has 
been committed. "
814,4," In an October 17, 1997 letter from Allegheny Power's president, Alan Noia, to Pittsburgh Mayor Thomas Murphy, Noia states: ""I 
am, therefore, committing to you that, if the . . . PUC grants the City's request . . . to allow utilities other than Duquesne Light 
Company to provide electric service to the two economic development zones, subject to PUC approval, . . . [Allegheny Power] 
will expand its service territory to include the economic development zones."" (J.A. at 499a.) This letter was sent after the 
proposed merger. "

submissions from the parties. See Government's Letter Briefs, received December 18, 1997 and January 23, 1998; Defendants' 
Letter Briefs, received December 23, 1997 and February 9, 1998 (responding to government's Letter Briefs). "

828,6," Section 5(a), 46 U.S.C. App. 1704(a), requires the filing of a conference agreement with the FMC. Section 5(b), 46 U.S.C. App. 
1704(b), sets forth the requisite contents of any filed conference agreement, and section 6, 46 U.S.C. App. § 1705, governs the 
disposition of filed agreements. "
834,7," Because the Court grants defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the indictment alleges conduct that 
falls within the relevant Shipping Act exemption, it is not necessary to reach defendants' alternative argument that bilateral 
treaties between the United States and the Philippines also require dismissal of the indictment. "
835,8," United States v. King, 587 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1978), relied on by Tucor, does not compel a different conclusion. In King, a 
doctor was charged as a co-defendant in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute. The indictment identified 
the doctor as a physician but did not allege that he distributed cocaine without a legitimate medical purpose.  Id. at 963. The 
court held that the indictment failed to state an element of the offense and was therefore deficient. Id. The King decision was 
premised on the Ninth Circuit's earlier conclusion in United States v. Black, 512 F.2d 864 (9th Cir. 1975), that the lack of 
authorization to dispense a controlled substance was an element of the crime charged.  King, 587 F.2d at 963. In contrast, there 
is no support for the view that the inapplicability of the subject Shipping Act exemption is an element of the charges against 
Tucor that must appear in the indictment. Accordingly, the Court rejects Tucor's argument that King requires that the indictment 
raise and negate the relevant Shipping Act exemption. "
859,1," According to HSI, the chancery court and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction when HSI sought permission to appeal the 
court of appeals' decision. Because the court of appeals had not issued an enforceable order yet, HSI's only option was to seek 
relief in the Tennessee Supreme Court."
859,2," In its present pleadings, HSI claims that it never asserted in 1979 that Mr. Ledford had disclosed HSI trade secrets. HSI's 1998 
Mem. in Resp. to Defs'. M. for Sum. J. (doc. 63, at 3). However, according to defendants FFI and Sam Crace, R. Joseph Crace's 
1979 affidavit indicates that HSI did assert in 1979 that Mr. Ledford had disclosed HSI trade secrets. In the seventh paragraph of 
his affidavit, R. Joseph Crace states that if Baltimore Spice representatives came to B&L Laboratories to ""observe the 
manufacturing process and to offer technical assistance,"" the trade secrets of HSI would be revealed and their value would be 
""diminished beyond calculation."" Id. at P 7. What HSI fails to point out, but what FFI catches, is that R. Joseph Crace stated in 
the third paragraph of that same affidavit that Baltimore Spice representatives did recently visit the B&L Laboratories to offer 
technical assistance. Id. at P 3. Reading paragraphs seven and three together, one could conclude that HSI's trade secrets were 
rendered valueless when the Baltimore Spice representatives came to offer technical assistance at B&L Labs, contrary to the 
assertion of HSI in its pleadings before this Court."
859,3," HSI's petition for contempt is undated, except to show that the year was 1980. We know, however, that HSI must have filed its 
petition prior to April 3, 1980 since that is the day the chancellor issued his order on that matter. "
863,4," Both the case cited by the plaintiff, Johns-Manville Corp. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., 586 F. Supp. 1034, 1041 (E.D. Mich. 1983), 
and the case cited by the defendants, Arco Indus. Corp. v. Chemcast, 633 F.2d 435, 441-43 (6th Cir. 1980), rely on Michigan 
law rather than Tennessee law and are therefore merely persuasive."
863,5," HN4[
] The term ""passing off"" is synonymous with ""palming off."" Both refer to ""false representation tending to induce buyers 
to believe that the defendant's product is that of the plaintiff . . . ."" See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser & Keeton on the Law of 
Torts § 130, at 1015 (5th ed. 1984). "
864,6," In the Court's August, 1997 Memorandum Opinion, (doc. 37), the Court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. 
The defendants based their motion in part on the theory of patent preemption. At that point, the Court found that a question of 
material fact existed as to whether HSI's patent was a product patent or a process patent. As authority on that point, the Court 
cited Arco Indus. Corp. v. Chemcast Corp., 633 F.2d 435, 443 (6th Cir. 1980). Arco was an appeal from a federal district court 
sitting in Michigan, applying Michigan law. Upon further examination, the Court finds that Arco is not controlling in the instant 
case on the issue of patent preemption. No other Sixth Circuit case analyzes this issue (process versus product patent) and, 
more importantly, nor does any Tennessee court. Additionally, neither party in the instant suit has raised the issue of the 
product/process patent difference. "
865,7," In concluding that the defendants infringed the plaintiff's patent, the Johns-Manville Court noted the infringement of two specific 
parts of the technology: the Heated Spinner Ambient, and the Air Ring. 586 F. Supp. 1034 at 1067-69. (As to the heated spinner "
866,," ambient, the court found that while a certain element of the spinner was an improvement to the patent, the defendants ""ignored 
the file wrapper history, and read J-M's claims too narrowly."" Id. at 1067. Neither party in the instant case has raised the issue of 
file wrapper estoppel.) The Johns-Manville Court then addressed the trade secret issues, and noted the nine trade secrets that the plaintiff claimed the 
defendants misappropriated. Id. at 1069. The Court sealed part of its discussion on this issue, see id. at 1073 (sealing pages 
114-27 of the opinion), and then concluded that the defendants had misappropriated the Air Ring (along with three other trade 
secrets), while also concluding that the defendants had not misappropriated the Heated Spinner Ambient.  Id. at 1076. 
Therefore, it is unclear how the Johns-Manville Court reached this conclusion. "
867,8," Discovery closed on April 10, 1998 (per the Court's Order of January 6, 1998), except that, at HSI's request, the defendants 
agreed to extend the date for any expert deposition and agreed to a future supplemental deposition of Sam Crace. See Mar. 27, 
1998 Agreed Order (doc. 59). "

873,1," Because this is an appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we take Kottle's factual allegations as true.  Federation of 
African American Contractors v. City of Oakland, 96 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir. 1996). "
874,2, The record does not indicate whether Kottle exercised his right to appeal the Department's decision to an adjudicatory hearing. 
875,3," Of course, HN8[
] since the Petition Clause mentions only the right ""to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,"" U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 6 (emphasis added), the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not protect lobbying efforts directed at private 
organizations.  Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 499-500, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497, 108 S. Ct. 1931 
(1988). Kottle reads into Allied Tube a distinction between ""political"" and ""economic"" lobbying activity, from which he argues that 
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not apply in this case because NWK's activities were designed only to promote NWK's own 
economic gain. Such a distinction would render the doctrine a nullity since it is doubtful that an antitrust defendant exists that 
was not motivated by economic gain. We read Allied Tube more narrowly, as merely recognizing the public/private distinction 
recognized in the Petition Clause itself."
875,4," The present case is also analogous to Assigned Container Ship Claims, Inc. v. American President Lines, Ltd., 784 F.2d 1420 
(9th Cir. 1986), in which we extended Noerr-Pennington immunity to petitions before the Federal Maritime Administration 
concerning the need for additional American flag ocean carrier service.  Id. at 1422. "
877,5," The Supreme Court suggested as much in California Motor Transp. when it lumped together courts and certain administrative 
agencies, and referred to them collectively as ""adjudicatory tribunals"" for purposes of the sham exception. 404 U.S. at 512. As 
should be clear from our opinion, this circuit does not read California Motor Transp. to say that all administrative entities are 
equivalent to judicial ones for purposes of Noerr-Pennington. Rather, California Motor Transp. suggests that an administrative 
sgency should be treated like a judicial one only if the former is, in fact, acting in an ""adjudicatory"" capacity. "
879,6," It also appears that Kottle has taken his ""best shot."" The record does not disclose that he requested leave to amend his 
complaint."
879,7," In addition to his challenge to NWK's Noerr-Pennington immunity, Kottle contends that the district court erred in not striking an 
affidavit attached to NWK's reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss. The affidavit's sole purpose was to put before 
the court certain public records of the Department. We agree with the district court that these records were properly the subject 
of judicial notice; therefore, reliance on them did not convert the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion.  Barron v. 
Reich, 13 F.3d 1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1994). "
883,1, Ashley Communications and James Davis were not plaintiffs in the action below. 
884,2," While the State filed an objection to the proposed order, prepared by Steven Evans' counsel, it apparently objected only to the 
order's conclusion that plaintiffs' conduct was exempt. The State proposed an order without a finding on the exemption issue; 
however, the court signed the order and denied the State's objection. "

885,5," The Arizona Consumer Fraud Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1521 to -1534, and the Arizona Uniform State Antitrust Act, Ariz. Rev. 
Stat. §§ 44-1401 to -1416, are both codified under title 44, chapter 10 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, which governs 
competition and competitive practices in trade and commerce. The provisions of each Act governing the Arizona attorney 
general's power to investigate violations thereunder are substantially similar. Compare id. § 44-1406(B) (""If the court finds that 
the demand is proper, that there is reasonable cause to believe there may have been a violation of this article and that the 
information sought or document or object demanded is relevant to the violation, it shall order the person to comply with the 
demand."") with id. § 44-1527(B) (""If the court determines that the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that the "
886,," respondent has engaged in, is engaging in or is about to engage in any act . . . which is in violation of this article . . . the court 
shall grant the appropriate relief.""). Therefore, we believe that the Arizona Supreme Court's discussion of the reasonable cause 
standard under the Consumer Fraud Act is applicable to the reasonable cause standard under the Uniform State Antitrust Act."
886,6," Compare ""probable cause"" with our definition of ""reasonable cause"" in the context of warrantless arrests: ""The requirement, as 
in so many areas of the law, is one of reason: that it be shown that under the facts and circumstances known to the officer, a 
reasonable and prudent man in his position would be justified in believing that the suspect had committed the offense."" State v. 
Lopez, 22 Utah 2d 257, 451 P.2d 772, 775 (1969). "
887,7," Article IV provides in part: No contract or other transaction between the Company and any firm or corporation shall be affected by the fact that a member or

individually or with others, may be a party to, or may have an interest in, any transaction of the Company or any transaction in

889,9, See Utah Code Ann. §§ 54-8b-1 to -13. 
905,1," In Areeda and Hovenkamp's, Antitrust Law, supra, § 740, the authors describe footnote 1 of Rebel I (which stated ""The cost of 
this 'last barrel' of gasoline [in the Tosco agreement, discussed supra] represents ARCO's marginal cost for gasoline."") as 
follows: In the Ninth Circuit's Rebel Oil case the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was unable to supply gasoline at the predatory 
price from its own refineries, so it contracted to purchase more from an independent supplier, and paid more than it 
charged upon resale. If so, the resulting price was clearly below marginal cost. Further, as the court noted, that would be 
true of all sales made at that price, not only for the sales of the gasoline bought at a high price. ""Marginal"" cost does not 
look at the average cost, but the incremental cost of the last unit produced, which in this case was the higher cost units 
procured from the independent supplier. Id. at p. 378 (emphases added) (footnotes omitted). Rebel claims that this shows that footnote 1 established the law of the case. 
We disagree. Rebel's selection from Antitrust Law states only what Rebel alleged: that the Tosco agreement represented a 
""purchase"" for which ARCO ""paid,"" and that ""if so,"" the agreement would serve as a measure of marginal cost. "
909,2," Because we affirm the grant of summary judgment on below-cost pricing, we do not address ARCO's challenge to the district 
court's decision on recoupment, nor do we address Rebel's argument regarding the measure of its damages. "
915,1," Similarly, Sun Microsystems's ""Java"" programming language allows programmers to write applications that will run on any 
computer, regardless of the operating system, as long as certain Java-related software (a Java ""virtual machine"" and Java ""class 
libraries"") is present. Internet browsers incorporate the necessary Java-related software, and hence allow Java programs to live 
up to their ""write once, run anywhere"" billing. "
916,2," The Department's language suggests that two products, and indeed, two license agreements are at issue. See, e.g., the 
Department Br. at 4 (""Microsoft conditioned its OEM licenses to Windows 95 on OEMs' licensing Internet Explorer."") It is 
undisputed that OEMs enter into only one license agreement, which covers IE as part of Windows 95. J.A. 1274. Microsoft's 
central argument, of course, is that there is only one product. The terminology used in our introductory recitation of facts is of 
course not intended to resolve, or to reflect any resolution of, contested issues, and no inference as to those issues should be 
drawn from the wording of this section."
916,3," Additionally, by allowing OEMs to conceal IE, rather than to refuse it, the remedy fits poorly with the Department's tying theory. 
A tie-in is not affected by the purchaser's ability to discard the tied good. "
918,4," Microsoft then grounded its objection on the fact that the Department had urged the court ""not to permit discovery, not to 
conduct an evidentiary hearing and to decide the matter on the papers before the District Court."" Id. at 12. These objections, 
however valid, are completely independent of the theory we address here. As we find the preliminary injunction procedurally 
defective on other grounds, we need not reach them. "
919,5," We have noted recently, and more than once, that the concept of a ""remedial"" statute is unhelpful. All statutes, unless purely 
declaratory, seek to ""remedy"" something about the pre-existing state of affairs. The cases seem bereft of references to 
""destructive"" statutes. See East Bay Municipal Utility Dist. v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 142 F.3d 479, 1998 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 8346, 1998 WL 210612 *5-*6 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Ober United Travel Agency, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Labor, 328 U.S. 
App. D.C. 410, 135 F.3d 822, 825 (D.C. Cir. 1998)."
919,6," The district court mentioned irreparable harm, but not in any terms suggesting focus on the relevant concern--whether denial of 
relief would result in harm to the competitive interests asserted by the government. It said that the Department is threatened with "
920,," irreparable harm because ""the cost of a compulsory unbundling of Windows 95 and IE in the future could be prohibitive,"" J.A. 
1297, which seems rather more like a risk to Microsoft if it continues its current practice and ultimately loses in court."
920,7," We agree with Judge Wald's suggestion, see Sep. Op. at 13-14, that there is something unusual about de novo review of a 
district court interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a consent decree. HN9[
] Consent decrees are generally interpreted 
as contracts. See United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 236-37, 43 L. Ed. 2d 148, 95 S. Ct. 926 (1975). 
Interpretation of an ambiguous contract term on the basis of extrinsic evidence is generally treated as a question of fact, and the 
district court's findings as to the parties' intent are reviewed deferentially, i.e., reversed only for clear error. See, e.g., NRM Corp. 
v. Hercules, 244 U.S. App. D.C. 356, 758 F.2d 676, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1985). This court, however, has regularly engaged in de novo 
review of district court interpretations of concededly ambiguous provisions which the parties sought to clarify with evidence from 
outside the decree itself. See, e.g., United States v. Western Electric Co., 304 U.S. App. D.C. 199, 12 F.3d 225, 229, 231 (D.C. 
Cir. 1993) (announcing de novo review despite admitted ambiguity); United States v. Western Electric Co., 283 U.S. App. D.C. 
299, 900 F.2d 283, 293, 296 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (""Triennial Review"") (same); see also 900 F.2d at 294 (characterizing issue as 
""pure question of law""). Nor does the Supreme Court's opinion in ITT, which relies on the presence of ambiguity to distinguish 
Armour, see ITT, 420 U.S. at 238 & n.11, give any indication of deference. Of course, HN10[
] de novo review of legal analysis 
is in principle compatible with deference to factual findings. See Triennial Review, 900 F.2d at 293-94 (explaining that ""aside 
from fact-finding, we owe no deference to the district court's decisions""); North Shore Laboratories Corp. v. Cohen, 721 F.2d 
514, 518-19 (5th Cir. 1983) (reviewing de novo while also noting deference to factual findings of parties' intent). This mixed 
approach may be the correct one, although the centrality of intent would often make the deference swallow the de novo review, 
a result our cases do not seem to contemplate. But here it would amount to de novo review anyway, as the district court made 
no findings of fact as to intent to which we could defer. "
921,8," The indirect nature of the alleged tie may explain why § IV(E)(i) bars an agreement whose terms are ""expressly or impliedly 
conditioned upon … the licensing of any other Covered Product."" "
922,9," In rejecting the Department's use of functionality here we do not mean to suggest that it is never an appropriate criterion of 
identity. In some contexts it may be appropriate to treat as equivalent two products that supply the same functionality, if they 
meet the same demand. Computer programs written for different operating systems, however, do not seem to meet the same 
demand, so that acceptance of functionality as a sufficient criterion of identity would lead to odd results. Here, of course, the 
decree's acceptance of Windows 95 as a ""product"" rebuts the Department's view of what is forbidden; one possible explanation 
might be that functionality works as an initial screen for defining products, but one that is trumped by the ""integrated products"" 
proviso. "
923,10," The hospital in Jefferson Parish surely did not offer the tied good (anesthesia) separately from the tying good (surgery), but 
this fact played no role in the Court's decision."
923,11," The same analysis would apply to peripherals. If, for example, Microsoft tried to bundle its mouse with the operating system, it 
would have to show that the mouse/operating system package worked better if combined by Microsoft than it would if combined 
by OEMs. This is quite different from showing that the mouse works better with the operating system than other mice do. 
Compare Sep. Op. at 1-2. See X Areeda, Elhauge & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1746b. Problems seem unlikely to arise with 
peripherals, because their physical existence makes it easier to identify the act of combination. It seems unlikely that a plausible "
924,," claim could be made that a mouse and an operating system were integrated in the sense that neither could be said to exist 
separately. An operating system used with a different mouse does not seem like a different product. But Windows 95 without IE's 
code will not boot, J.A. 1623, and adding a rival browser will not fix this. If the add/remove utility is run to hide the IE 4 
technologies, Windows 95 reverts to an earlier version, OEM service release (""OSR"") 2.0. J.A. 1660-61."
924,12," Thus of course we agree with the separate opinion that ""commingling of code … alone is not sufficient evidence of true 
integration."" Sep. Op. at 4. Commingling for an anticompetitive purpose (or for no purpose at all) is what we refer to as ""bolting."""
924,13," The separate opinion seems to take this reluctance to engage in the evaluation of product design as deference to Microsoft's 
interpretation of the consent decree. See Sep. Op. at 2-3. It is nothing of the sort. We defer to neither party in interpreting the 
consent decree; in fact, we reject both parties' readings. We suggest here only that the limited competence of courts to evaluate 
high-tech product designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a 
particular design decision. "
925,14," The antitrust question is of course distinct. The parties agree that the consent decree does not bar a challenge under the 
Sherman Act."
925,15," This issue is peripheral on the Department's interpretation of § IV(E)(i), and the Department may not have contested it as 
vigorously as it might. The guidance this opinion seeks to provide is limited to setting out the legal framework for analysis. The 
ultimate sorting out of any factual disputes is a different question, and one we of course cannot resolve on the limited record 
before us."
925,16," It is possible, of course, for applications vendors to bring about this Microsoft-created integration by distributing IE with their 
applications, which is apparently a relatively common practice. See J.A. 953, 966. Distribution by application vendors does not 
affect the conclusion that the integrated design brings benefits, nor does it suggest that IE has an existence apart from Windows 
95. The consequence of this practice is simply that such applications upgrade the purchaser's operating system to the Windows 
95/IE level. The customer's act of installing the application implements Microsoft's prior integration of IE into Windows 95. The record also suggests that there are some inefficiencies associated with application vendors' redistribution of IE code. 
Application vendors' affidavits assert that if the browser is installed in computers before sale, ""installation of our product is faster, 
we have reduced product support issues, the perceived footprint (memory use) of our product is smaller, and in general 
customer perception of our product is better."" J.A. 953, 966. Although the drawbacks of installation by applications vendors can 
be alleviated by OEMs' preinstalling an integrated operating system containing IE technologies, the drawbacks are not 
necessary consequences of a standalone design, but rather incidental costs of a particular method of bringing about the benefits "
926,," of integration, namely, distribution of code by applications vendors. Thus they are not relevant to our comparison of the stand-
alone and integrated designs."
926,17," Our colleague's separate opinion suggests that IE may be separated from Windows 95 by treating some or all of the code that 
supplies operating system functionality as part of the operating system. Sep. Op. at 15. But apart from that code, there is nothing 
more to IE than the four lines of programming required to summon browsing functionality from code that also supplies operating 
system functionality. J.A. 1654. Those four lines look more like a key to opening IE than anything that could plausibly be 
considered IE itself."
926,18," The preliminary injunction, as construed by the parties' later stipulation, treats Microsoft as in compliance if it allows the 
options of (1) running the Add/Remove Programs utility with respect to IE 3.x and (2) removing the IE icon from the desktop and 
from the Programs list in the Start menu and marking the file IEXPLORE.EXE ""hidden."" See above at p. 7. The injunction's 
evidently unique status as a remedy for a ""tying"" complaint, requiring the defendant merely to allow an intermediary to hide the 
allegedly tied product, suggests the oddity of treating as separate products functionalities that are integrated in the way that 
Windows 95 and IE are. "
927,19," The proviso may be read to do this either by clarifying the concepts of ""Covered Product"" and an ""other product"" to prevent an 
""integrated"" product from constituting a forbidden duo, or by carving out an exception for integrated products even if they 
otherwise represent such a duo. We do not believe that the choice of approach makes a substantive difference."
927,20," Our colleague seems to hint that one way to perform this evaluation is to examine whether the integrated product 
""overwhelms"" the separate market. Sep. Op. at 10. But data on market performance will obviously not be available when the 
new product is introduced, and in any case, the overwhelming of the separate market is precisely what is feared and may simply 
indicate anticompetitive practices. "
928,21," The rule provides in relevant part: ""A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. In actions … to be tried 
without a jury, save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a reference shall be made only upon a 
showing that some exceptional condition requires it."" "
929,22," To the extent that adjudication may lead the court into deep technological mysteries, we note the court's power under Rule of 
Evidence 706 to appoint expert witnesses. Whether such an expert is appointed by agreement of the parties or not, the expert's 
exposure to cross-examination by both sides, see Rule 706(a), makes the device a far more apt way of drawing on expert 
resources than the district court's unilateral, unnoticed deputization of a vice-judge. "
931,1," The majority asserts that if Microsoft tried to bundle its mouse with the operating system, ""it would have to show that the 
mouse/operating system package worked better if combined by Microsoft than it would if combined by OEMs,"" a test that is 
""different from showing that the mouse works better with the operating system than other mice do."" Majority Opinion (""Maj. Op."") 
at 23 n.11. But this seems to me to misstate the majority's own test, which asserts that ""the act of combination is the creation of 
the design that knits the two together"" and not which firm's employees effect the physical combination. Id. at 28-30. If this is the 
case, then the majority's test would consider whether the design that ""knits together"" Microsoft's mouse and the operating 
system offers advantages unavailable through the combination of a competitor's mouse and the operating system. This is, I 
think, a standard easily met. For instance, Microsoft could develop a mouse with a patented, modestly useful feature, design its 
operating system to work best when used with a mouse that had this feature, and then require OEMs to buy the two products 
together. The mouse and the operating system would qualify as integrated under the majority's test. The majority says that IE 
4.0 and Windows 95 are integrated because the ""full functionality of the operating system when upgraded by IE 4 and the 
'browser functionality' of IE 4 … do not exist separately."" Id. at 29. Likewise, the full functionality of the patented mouse and 
Microsoft's mouse-friendly operating system would not exist separately; the two would be designed for each other, and their full 
functionality would only exist when combined. Thus, under the majority's test, Microsoft would have avoided the effect of section 
IV(E)(i) altogether, even if its patented mouse was of little extra value to the user. I would not think that the proviso was intended 
to swallow the consent decree in this way. "
932,2," The proviso states only that Microsoft is permitted to ""develop"" integrated products, but the parties agree that ""develop"" should 
not be limited to mere research and development."
932,3," The majority questions the institutional competence of the courts to judge the level of synergy provided by an ""integrated"" 
product. See Maj. Op. at 25. By no means do I endorse routine judicial intervention in the details of product design. But I also do 
not endorse (as the majority comes close to doing) judicial abdication in the face of complexity. The courts are certainly capable 
of determining whether a particular integration offers any synergistic benefits at all and whether these benefits are minimal, 
significant, or great. As this is a factual determination, they may be guided in this effort by, for example, affidavits, consumer 
surveys, and other evidence presented by the parties as well as testimony from experts selected by the parties or by the court. 
Certainly this approach is preferable to the majority's proposal, under which antitrust law surrenders to any bona fide assertion 
of a ""plausible"" benefit of integration. "
933,4," During his tenure as special master in this case, Lawrence Lessig offered a similar, although not identical, interpretation of 
section IV(E)(i) in a letter that has been made part of the record in this appeal. See Letter from Lessig to Malone et al., January 
19, 1998 (asserting that the prohibition of section IV(E)(i) forbids only tying through contract; it does not, as the proviso makes 
clear, forbid tying through technological efforts). The fact that Professor Lessig has proposed this quite plausible alternate 
interpretation of section IV(E)(i) does not, of course, suggest that his interpretation is the only acceptable one--that is a matter for 
the proceedings on remand to determine."
933,5," The majority expresses puzzlement as to how a section ""that (1) articulates a prohibition and (2) sets a limit on the reach of the 
prohibition"" can be read to state a balancing test. Maj. op. at 31. As I read section IV(E)(i), its application turns on distinguishing 
two products from a single, integrated product. The section surely requires that the product be legitimately integrated; otherwise, 
section IV(E)(i) would have no force. One plausible interpretation of the decree is that it refers the court to antitrust law to 
decide whether a product is legitimately integrated; in these circumstances, the antitrust analysis requires balancing. For my 
part, I am at a loss to understand how a consent decree that is clearly intended to limit Microsoft's conduct could be read to 
impose so little scrutiny of that conduct. One might ask why, under my proposed reading, section IV(E)(i) contains a proviso at all. I think it possible that the proviso was 
intended, ""in the intensely lawyered atmosphere surrounding this decree, to make assurance doubly sure,"" United States v. 
Western Elec. Co., Inc., 304 U.S. App. D.C. 199, 12 F.3d 225, 238 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Williams, J., dissenting)--in other words, that 
it was a lawyerly redundancy. I do not think, however, that it is necessary to read the proviso as serving so limited a function. 
Under my reading, the proviso serves to clarify that the prohibition of section IV(E)(i) is not boundless--that a product is not 
barred simply because it contains new combinations of previously existing functionalities. The proviso thus functions to eliminate 
one possible reading of section IV(E)(i). Given that the proviso is cast in terms of interpretation-it says that section IV(E)(i) ""shall 
not be construed"" to bar integrated products--it is appropriate to accord it this limited, interpretive function."
933,6," The majority rejects DOJ's contention that a product is separate if Microsoft so treats it, see Maj. Op. at 19-20, but it does not 
address the government's associated contention that a product is separate if antitrust law so treats it, see id. at 19 (noting 
DOJ's citation of Jefferson Parish). "
934,7," As to the majority's observation that a product is not ""integrated"" if OEMs could perform the integration equally well on their 
own, my only comment is that this is an obvious point, and I am unclear what it adds to the analysis. A synergy should only 
count as such if it has benefits that the purchaser could not achieve equally well on his own. For example, there are synergistic 
benefits to combining cookies and milk, but a consumer can achieve them perfectly well at home. Thus, a supermarket could not 
ordinarily invoke this synergy as a justification for requiring cookies and milk to be bought together. "
935,8," The majority objects that there is no evidence that Microsoft and DOJ subjected Windows 95 to a balancing analysis. Maj. Op. 
at 31-32. Because of the procedural posture of this case, however, there is little evidence of any kind in the record as to what the 
parties to the consent decree intended. There is certainly no indication that Microsoft and DOJ subjected Windows 95 to the 
majority's minimal test."
935,9," The majority's test would seem to permit Microsoft to ""integrate"" word-processing programs, spreadsheets, 
financialmanagement software, and virtually any other now-separate software product into its operating system by identifying 
some minimal synergy associated with such ""integration."" In effect, the majority has fashioned a broad exemption from the 
antitrust laws for operating system design, apparently because an operating system is not like a peripheral, whose ""physical 
existence makes it easier to identify the act of combination."" Maj. Op. at 23 n.11. Surely, however, physical existence cannot 
serve as a limitation to the application of antitrust law--the provision of services, for example, is a mutable ""product"" without 
tangible existence and yet has often been the subject of antitrust analysis. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (anesthesiological services); Allen-Myland, 33 F.3d 194 (installation of computer parts); Service & Training, 
963 F.2d 680 (computer maintenance and repair services). "
936,10," Indeed, the district court acknowledged that ""disputed issues of technological fact, as well as contract interpretation, abound 
as the record presently stands."" Microsoft, 980 F. Supp. at 543."
936,11," The majority's assertion that ""the district court made no findings of fact as to intent to which we could defer,"" Maj. Op. at 15 
n.7, makes restraint particularly appropriate. "
937,12," Notably, the majority's assertion to this effect relies on testimony presented by Microsoft during hearings on whether Microsoft 
had failed to comply with the preliminary injunction, testimony that was challenged by the government. See Maj. Op. at 29 
(citing, e.g., J.A. 1661-68). The parties' eventual settlement of this dispute, see J.A. 1780 (Stipulation and Order), obviated any 
need for factual findings on this issue by the district court. Given that much of the testimony involved in-court demonstrations, 
see, e.g., J.A. 1661-72, I believe that it would be premature for this court to weigh in with its own resolution of this factual 
dispute."
937,13," The district court's opinion does refer to one unit of analysis as ""the software code that Microsoft itself now separately 
distributes at retail as 'Internet Explorer 3.0,' "" Microsoft, 980 F. Supp. at 544, but the usefulness of this description was called 
into question in subsequent proceedings. See J.A. 1619 (assertion by Microsoft executive that it distributed no product at retail 
titled ""Internet Explorer 3.0""); J.A. 1780 (agreement by DOJ and Microsoft that removal of only certain files would comply with 
preliminary injunction)."
937,14," A word-processing program, for example, may contain a dictionary feature as well as update certain operating-system code 
once installed. The fact that other applications may call on the dictionary files, or that if the word-processing program were 
removed in its entirety, certain operating-system files would be ""degraded,"" does not necessarily mean that the word-processing 
program is integrated with the operating system. It may be that only part of the program is so integrated, or it may be that none 
of it performs an operating-system function."
937,15," In this respect, I note that this court has rejected the notion that the requirement that the government show a ""substantial 
likelihood of success"" means ""to a certainty"" or even ""to 51 percent."" See Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm'n v. Holiday 
Tours, Inc., 182 U.S. App. D.C. 220, 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Rather, because the district court is to assess the 
propriety of a preliminary injunction in light of the relative strengths of all four factors (likelihood of success on the merits, 
irreparable injury, harm to other parties, and furtherance of the public interest), ""the necessary 'level' or 'degree' of possibility of 
success will vary according to the court's assessment of the other factors."" 559 F.2d at 843. "

948,1," Note, we need not at this time advert to the District Court's discussion of exclusive distributorships in which the court found that 
""exclusive distributorships are perfectly legal under the Sherman Act."" George Haug Co. Inc. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars Inc., 
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13650, No. 96 Civ. 3140,1997 WL 563806 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 1997). Exclusive distributorships are 
not per se authorized under the Sherman Act. Instead, we have heretofore held that an exclusive distributorship agreement, 
standing alone, is not illegal. See Electronics Communications Corp. v. Toshiba America Consumer Products, Inc., 129 F.3d 
240, 245 (2d Cir. 1997); Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 133 (2d Cir. 1978). In order to succeed, a plaintiff must 
demonstrate that the exclusive distributorship had an ""actual adverse effect on competition market-wide. . . ."" Electronics 
Communications Corp. at 244. That is, the focus remains on market effect. Haug has not alleged the existence of an exclusive 
distributorship, and we are not assured that had it done so, it would not have alleged that the exclusive distributorship resulted in 
antitrust injury. "
949,2," HN7[
] Price discrimination claims generally fall into three categories. The first, primary line price discrimination, occurs when 
a seller's price discrimination harms competition with the seller's competitors. See, e.g., Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993). The second, secondary-line price 
discrimination, occurs when a seller's discrimination impacts competition among the seller's customers; i.e. the favored 
purchasers and disfavored purchasers. See, e.g., F.T.C. v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 9 L. Ed. 2d 466, 83 S. Ct. 358 (1963). 
The third, tertiary-line violation, occurs when the seller's price discrimination harms competition between customers of the 
favored and disfavored purchasers, even though the favored and disfavored purchasers do not compete directly against another. 
See, e.g., Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 436, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 103 S. Ct. 1282 (1983). "

Medical Company v. John D. Park & Sons Company, 220 U.S. 373, 55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911). The flaw in Metro's 
reasoning is its failure to recognize the existence, and corresponding significance, of the systems of contracts involved in that 
case. The plaintiff, Dr. Miles Medical Company, had devised a system of contracts with its customers to maintain minimum 
resale prices at which its proprietary medicine products would be sold. The defendant, John D. Park & Sons, was a wholesale 
drug company which refused to enter into such a contract. The plaintiff charged that the defendant, ""in combination and 
conspiracy with a number of wholesale and retail dealers in drugs and proprietary medicines,"" procured its medicines by 
inducing the violation of the contracts.  31 S. Ct. at 381-82. "
962,," The plaintiff's right to relief depended on the validity of the restrictive contracts, making it the central issue before the Court. The 
Court found, however, that the contracts constituted unlawful resale price maintenance by restricting ""the freedom of trade on 
the part of dealers who own what they sell."" This finding that resale price maintenance is per se illegal under § 1 has been 
reaffirmed by the Court. See United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960);

made it clear that vertical price restraints require an agreement or concerted action, and not just an effect on resale prices, to be 
per se unlawful.  485 U.S. 717, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808. We thus focus on whether the restraint is unilateral or 
concerted for all aspects of a section 1 claim."

969,1," Cessna's statement of facts contains interpretations of governmental regulations. However, Mellon does not dispute Cessna's 
interpretations, so the court treats these interpretations as accurate for summary judgment purposes. "
970,," In its reply brief, Cessna objects to Mellon's practice of stating the fact which he wishes to infer from the evidence, then 
identifying the evidence which he claims supports the inference. Cessna argues this practice violates D.Kan.R. 56.1 and asks 
the court to disregard all such inferences. The court does not consider Mellon's practice to be in violation of the local rule. Where 
the cited facts reasonably support the inference, the court presumes, as it must in the summary judgment stage, that Mellon's 
inference is true. Mellon's approach actually makes it easier for the court to evaluate the significance of the cited facts and the 
reasonableness of the inference. The court notes that Cessna followed a similar practice. See e.g., Cessna's Statement of 
Undisputed Facts PP 48, 49, 104."
970,2," Cessna cites other factors Mellon considered, as well as other planes. This does not mean that Mellon did not consider the 
availability of Cessna service as a factor."

assertion that he asked Knapp whether Cessna would continue to perform major maintenance and phase inspections on the 
plane if he had it modified. "
971,4," Cessna disputes this fact, but Mellon has cited admissible evidence from which it is reasonable to conclude that Cessna initially 
refused to provide any service to modified aircraft. "
977,5," Presumably, Cessna is arguing that the pro-competitive effects in the service area mean that Cessna cannot have intended to 
monopolize the sales area. Cessna does not even argue that the lost profit in the service area exceeds the profit gained from the 
alleged increase in sales attributable to the Service Letter. "

Dennis Kincaid could possibly be admissible against Kincaid as an admission by a party opponent, this evidence is likely "

accepts this evidence, there is insufficient proof of a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."
983,3," Rockholt did not assert some of these claims until its amended complaint filed on May 8, 1997 (Court File No. 16). "
985,4, See footnote number 2.
985,5," Rockholt alleges Robert Lemons testified Dennis Kincaid made the decision to terminate Rockholt. Rockholt contends this 
testimony is inconsistent with Dennis Kincaid's testimony that ""[He] could not veto the decision"" (Rockholt's Response to the 
Motions for Summary Judgment, pp. 10-11). However, a review of the deposition excerpts reveals Roberts Lemons actually 
testified that Mr. Kincaid initiated the decision to terminate Rockholt and Lemons approved the decision (Lemons Depo. Excerpts 
I, p. 57). This testimony is consistent with Mr. Kincaid's description of the termination decision (D. Kincaid Depo., pp. 110-111). 
Thus, Rockholt's contention is not supported by die evidence."

986,9," In Bailey's, the plaintiff opposed summary judgment as to its contract, federal antitrust, and state antitrust claims. The plaintiff's 
brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, however, ""was devoted almost exclusively to [the] contract and federal 
antitrust issues."" Bailey's, 948 F.2d at 1032. With respect to the Tennessee state antitrust claim, the plaintiff merely quoted the 
statute and stated, ""The comments made above concerning the federal antitrust laws are also applicable to the Tennessee 
antitrust laws."" Id. The district court found the plaintiff had failed to present sufficient evidence of a Sherman Act violation. The district court then 
also granted summary judgment on plaintiff's state antitrust claims ""indicating that the plaintiff has no case under the state 
statutes for reasons similar to those given for the conclusion that the plaintiff has no case under federal antitrust law."" Id. The 
Sixth Circuit affirmed both these rulings."

Kincaid could not be liable for a violation of § 47-50-109 and would also be entitled to summary judgment."
988,15, Rockholt did not address this issue in its Response to the Motions for Summary Judgment. 
994,1," In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants also seek summary judgment on the remainder of Marshall's state-law 
claims, with the exception of the breach-of-contract claim. This order, however, addresses only the federal and state antitrust 
claims. "
996,2," It should be noted that the defendants challenge on hearsay grounds the admissibility of Marshall's evidence regarding this, 
and various other, conversations that Marshall alleges to have taken place. However, as explained more fully below, the court 
concludes that Marshall's antitrust claims cannot withstand summary judgment even if all of the alleged conversations did in fact 
occur and the participants actually said what Marshall alleges them to have said. Consequently, the court will proceed on the 
assumption that the statements are admissible without addressing the merits of the defendants' challenge."
996,3," The uncontradicted record shows that no such exclusive contract ever existed. However, Marshall has proffered evidence 
suggesting that Blackmon and Planz contemplated executing such a contract in the wake of the dissolution of the Marshall-Planz 
partnership, or, alternatively, that an already existing, but unsigned, exclusive contract between Planz and SAMC would be 
executed. "
999,4," In deciding this case on the merits without reaching the standing question, the court adheres to the standard set by the 
Eleventh Circuit in Levine v. Central Fla. Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996) (decision on the merits without 
addressing standing is appropriate where a court concludes that the plaintiff has not made out an antitrust violation). "
1000,5," The court emphasizes that it has not fully considered the question of whether Marshall has established the requisite antitrust 
injury, which requires a complicated analysis of whether the harms he complains of truly flow from any harms to competition 
worked by the revocation of his surgical privileges in Dothan. However, because Marshall has not satisfied the tort-based 
causation requirement for the reasons explained in the text of this order, the court is not called upon to decide the antitrust-injury 
question. "
1001,6," Order on pretrial hearing, entered on June 18, 1998, at 4. Within this broad category Marshall points to six specific statements 
he attributes to Planz: (1) that Marshall routinely killed patients; (2) that he had a personality disorder and was suicidal; (3) that 
he abandoned his patients; (4) that he was suspended from his residency for six months; (5) that his privileges had been 
revoked, when in fact they had only been suspended at the time; and (6) that he was a danger to patients because he had 
cervical disc disease and other medical problems. See id. at 4-5. In his complaint. Marshall also alleges that Planz told ""patients 
and others"" in Dothan that Marshall had left town and would not resume practicing medicine in Dothan, which was untrue at the 
time. See Plaintiff's second amended compl., filed on Oct. 23, 1997, at P 33."

1002,10," Pretrial order, entered on June 18, 1998, at 3."
1002,11," Of course, once the decision to revoke Marshall's privileges was made, Planz's actions outside of the peer-review context 
were rendered wholly superfluous, and could not have further hindered Marshall's ability to compete in Dothan. For instance, the 
two alleged threats made by Planz to SAMC officials appear to have been calculated to persuade the hospital to impede 
Marshall's ability to compete against Planz by withdrawing necessary support for Marshall's practice, while the alleged remark to 
individuals in Dothan appears to have been aimed at interfering with his practice by discouraging patients from seeking his 
services. However, once SAMC and Flowers Hospital revoked Marshall's surgical privileges, he was no longer in a position to 
pursue a competing practice in Dothan because he could not perform surgery at either hospital. Thus, in reality it was the 
revocation of Marshall's privileges, if anything, that caused his alleged antitrust injuries."
1002,12," Plaintiff's second amended compl., filed on Oct. 23, 1997, at P 83."
1002,13," See defendants' exhibit no. 97, SAMC medical staff bylaws, at 22-23 (providing that the board makes the final decision 
regarding staff privileges). "
1004,14," These economic incentives include, according to Marshall's antitrust expert, a desire to (1) avoid unwanted price competition 
imposed by managed health care plans should Marshall establish a competing practice at Flowers hospital, and (2) avert the 
flight of Planz's practice to Flowers should SAMC side with Marshall and thus alienate Planz. See Plaintiff's exhibit no. 1 in 
opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, expert report of David M. Eisenstadt, Ph.D., at 29-30."
1004,15," Moreover, 13 of the 14 members of the board that revoked Marshall's privileges have testified during depositions or have 
stated in affidavits that Planz did not influence their decision to revoke Marshall's privileges. See defendants' memorandum in 
support of motion for summary judgment, filed on March 18, 1998, at 39-41."
1004,16," The court reaches this same conclusion regarding Marshall's § 2 monopolization claim, to the extent he alleges that Planz and 
the SAMC board conspired to create or maintain a monopoly over cardiac-surgery services. See Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1460 n.35 
(observing that § 1 and § 2 conspiracy claims require the same threshold showing of the existence of an agreement to restrain 
trade, and noting that the court need not address the specific intent element of the § 2 claim where the plaintiff fails to 
demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a conspiracy between the defendant physicians and hospital 
authority). "
1006,17," If Marshall were seeking injunctive relief due to the existence of an ongoing or recurring threat of monopoly posed by the 
defendants' actions, a different analysis would apply. However, because Marshall is now precluded from resuming his practice in 
Dothan because he does not possess the requisite staff privileges, the defendants no longer pose any threat to his economic 
interests, and injunctive relief is unavailable."

1010,5, The Court notes that the Complaint skips Count XIII when reciting Counts numbered I through XVII.
1010,6," This claim was previously dismissed without prejudice. However, the Plaintiffs have reinstated it with the consent of the 
Defendants."
1010,7," Plaintiffs originally also asserted claims for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, negligence, and strict 
liability. These claims have been dismissed without prejudice by the Plaintiffs. "
1011,8," Furthermore, even if they were to prevail in the instant suit, the Funds ""could not unilaterally reduce the employers' 
contributions because these contributions are determined in a collective bargaining agreement to which the Fund[s are] not a 
party."" Southeast Florida Laborers Dist. Heath and Welfare Trust Fund v. Philip Morris, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5440, at *6, No.

regard to Plaintiffs' RICO claims."
1012,11," Thus, contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, the remoteness principle applies equally to both negligent and intentional torts. "
1013,12," The circuit court noted that its holding ""does not mean that the Court is unmindful of the dilemma faced by the State and the 
magnitude of the harm which may have been caused by the defendants. Assuming the truth of all relevant facts as argued by 
the Plaintiff, it is clear that the State of Maryland has borne the tremendous burden of this health care crisis, in both lives and 
financial resources. Unfortunately, . . . without proper legal remedy, there exists no claim upon which relief can be granted."" 
State of Maryland v. Philip Morris, Inc., No. 96122017, CL211487, 1997 WL 540913 at *14 (Md. Cir. Ct. for Balt. City May 21, 
1997)."
1013,13," Plaintiffs disavow any intention to bring subrogation claims, presumably, among other reasons, to avoid having to identify and 
prove the multitude of individual cases involved."
1013,14," As the Plaintiffs view such ""truth."" The Court is expressing no opinion as to whether, on the merits, the Defendants are guilty of 
such concealment or misrepresentation."
1013,15," Defendants contend that ""What the Funds fail to acknowledge is that the very same attempt to re-package the State's 
derivative injury claim as a claim for 'direct' harm was made by the State and rejected by the court in State of Maryland; both the 
complaint and the briefs submitted by the State contended that the State itself had 'detrimentally relied' upon defendants' 
supposed fraud and concealment. The State of Maryland court saw through that verbal charade and recognized that -- as here -- 
all of the claimed injuries to the State flowed from the injuries allegedly inflicted upon smokers."" Defendants' Reply at 4-5. "
1014,16," In addition, the parties have cited to numerous decisions issued in cases brought by state attorneys general or other 
governmental entities making similar allegations against the tobacco industry. While these decisions certainly are relevant to the 
instant discussion, the Plaintiff Funds stand in a somewhat different position than the states, which are sovereign entities. By 
contrast, the three recent federal district court decisions addressing claims brought by ERISA funds are directly on point. The 
Court therefore considers them to be most persuasive."
1014,17," Certainly the wealthy benefactor in Anthony v. Slaid would have paid fewer medical expenses on behalf of the town's paupers 
had the defendant's wife not committed a battery against one of them. Still, his claim to recoup the additional medical expenses 
that he was forced to pay was barred as too remote."
1014,18," The Court rejects Plaintiffs' contention that unlike a typical insurer, they have a ""special relationship"" with their participants 
which gives them some direct injury. As stated by the Minnesota Supreme Court in rejecting a similar argument by Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield of Minnesota, ""It is true that Blue Cross occupies a different niche in the complex web of health care institutions 
than that of indemnity or insurance companies; however, these differences in legal relationship to providers and patients do not, 
in our view, overcome the need for a closer connection between the injury and alleged tortfeasor."" State of Minnesota v. Philip 
Morris, Inc., 551 N.W.2d 490, 495 (Minn. 1996). As Judge Ryskamp held, ""This 'special relationship' fails to show that the 
[Plaintiff Funds have] suffered direct harm."" Southeast Fla., 1998 WL 186878 at *4. "
1015,19," Count I alleges violation of §§ 1962(c) and (d) by all Defendants except the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco 
Institute, and Hill & Knowlton, Inc. Count II alleges violation of §§ 1962(a) and (d) by all Defendants."
1015,20," As the Supreme Court noted, ""In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity, and the causes of 
an event go back to the dawn of human events, and beyond. But any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basis would 
result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts, and would 'set society on edge and fill the courts with endless litigation.'"" Holmes, 
503 U.S. at 266 n.10 (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts  § 41, p. 264 
(5th ed. 1984)). "
1016,21," Richardson v. Philip Morris, Inc., No. 96145050/CE212596 (Cir. Ct. Balt. Cty.)."
1016,22," In light of the general principles of the collateral source rule, the Court fails to see why the Plaintiffs' injured participants could 
not recover these same medical expenses. This is particularly so given Plaintiffs' insistence that the employer contributions to 
the Funds are in fact substitute wages for the employees, i.e., that it is truly the employees' own funds being contributed."
1016,23," Plaintiffs' reliance on State of Florida v. American Tobacco Co., No. CL 95-1466 AH, 1996 WL 788371 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Dec. 13, 
1996) is misplaced. State of Florida was based upon Florida's RICO act, not the federal statute, and on the court's conclusion 
that the State, as opposed to a private litigant, did not have to meet the requirements of proximate cause. See Southeast 
Florida, 1998 WL at *5 n.5 (discussing State of Florida). Furthermore, to the extent that other courts have allowed federal RICO 
claims to go forward in cigarette cost recovery cases, this Court notes a respectful disagreement with those decisions for the 
reasons stated above. "
1017,24," The claims brought under the Maryland Antitrust Act assert essentially the same antitrust violations. The Maryland General 
Assembly has declared that courts construing that Act should be guided by the interpretations given to the federal antitrust acts. 
Md. Code Ann. Com. Law II § 11-202; Cities Serv. Oil Co. v. Burch,29 Md. App. 430, 349 A.2d 279, 283 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 
1975). Thus, the parties agree that the Court's inquiry is the same under both the federal and Maryland statutes. See Plaintiffs' 
Opposition at 32."
1017,25," Although § 4 of the Clayton Act states that ""any person who shall be injured . . . by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust 
laws may sue,"" federal courts have not interpreted this section as broadly as its literal language could suggest. As stated by the 
Supreme Court, ""It is reasonable to assume that Congress did not intend to allow every person tangentially affected by an 
antitrust violation to maintain an action to recover threefold damages for the injury to his business or property."" Associated 
General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 
897 (quoting Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 477, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982)."
1017,26," The Associated General Contractors court stated that Congress intended that antitrust litigation ""would be subject to 
constraints comparable to well-accepted common-law rules applied in comparable litigation"", including the requirements of 
proximate cause. Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 533."
1017,27," The fact that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City allowed the State of Maryland to pursue its claim under the Maryland Antitrust 
Act does not help the Plaintiff Funds. The circuit court based its decision on a provision of the Maryland statute which it felt made 
""it absolutely clear that the Maryland legislature intended for the State to pursue causes of action against potential antitrust 
violators regardless of whether injuries sustained by the state were remote and regardless of whether or not the State dealt 
directly with the alleged violator."" State of Maryland v. Philip Morris, Inc., No. 96122017, CL211487, 1997 WL 540913 at *20 
(Md. Cir. Ct. for Balt. City May 21, 1997). There is no such statutory provision for private plaintiffs like the Plaintiff Funds."
1017,28," The three judges who, to date, have issued decisions in cigarette cost recovery suits brought by ERISA funds against the 
tobacco industry. "
1018,29," Plaintiffs' reliance on Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982) is misplaced. In 
McCready, the plaintiff was a subscriber in Blue Shield. She alleged an antitrust conspiracy between Blue Shield and an 
organization of psychiatrists to exclude psychologists from receiving compensation from Blue Shield. Thus, the plaintiff could not 
receive reimbursement for the mental health treatment she received from a psychologist, although she could have been 
reimbursed if she had visited a psychiatrist instead. The Supreme Court held that she had standing because she was a 
consumer of psychotherapy services who was injured by the alleged conspiracy to prevent psychologists from serving Blue 
Shield subscribers. Thus, ""Blue Shield did not involve a derivative claim. On the contrary, it involved a purchaser's claim against 
an antitrust offender. In this case, the Fund[s have] not purchased any products from the defendants. Thus, [their] claim is wholly 
derivative."" Southeast Florida, 1998 WL 186878 at *6 n.7. The Plaintiff Funds are not in an analogous position to the plaintiff in 
McCready. On the allegations of the instant case, if anyone other than a competitor had standing to assert an antitrust injury 
stemming from the Defendants' alleged conspiracy to stifle information about safer cigarettes and the health consequences of 
tobacco, by the reasoning of McCready, it would be individual smokers, as they were the consumers of tobacco products. "
1019,30," The parties dispute whether, under the CPA, the Plaintiffs must be ""consumers"" of cigarettes in order to state a claim. In State 
of Maryland, relying on the statutory language that ""any person"" may bring a CPA claim, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City 
allowed the State's Consumer Protection Act claim to go forward, finding that ""neither the State nor any other plaintiff is required 
to be a consumer in order to assert a cause of action for damages under the CPA."" State of Maryland v. Philip Morris, Inc., No. 
96122017, CL211487, 1997 WL 540913 at *18 (Md. Cir. Ct. for Balt. City May 21, 1997). Other courts have stated, in a variety of 
contexts, that the CPA only provides a cause of action for consumers. See, e.g., Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 
Inc., 958 F.2d 594, 597 n.9 (4th Cir. 1992) (citing Layton v. AAMCO Transmissions, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 368, 371 (D. Md. 1989)). 
In light of the Court's conclusion that the causal connection between the alleged CPA violation and Plaintiffs' injuries is too 
tenuous, it is unnecessary to decide this issue."
1019,31," Although the State of Maryland court allowed the State's CPA claim to go forward, it did not separately address the causation 
issue discussed above. It is not clear whether such a challenge was made by the defendants in that case. In any event, 
irrespective of what the State of Maryland court may or may not have been presented with, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs 
have failed to state a claim."
1019,32," Indeed, the Court fails to see how the Plaintiffs ""discharged"" or ""satisfied"" any obligation which the Defendants had to pay the 
medical expenses of individual smokers. Given the collateral source rule, the Court assumes that the Defendants are still 
potentially liable to individual smokers for such damages."
1019,33," The Court does not reach the Defendants' contention that this claim must be dismissed because the Plaintiffs have an 
adequate remedy at law. "
1020,34," As noted in a recent decision in Rossello v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., No. CIV. 97-1910(JAF), 1998 WL 313365 
(D.P.R. June 2, 1998), if anyone, ""it is not Defendants who have received a benefit from [Puerto Rico's] medical care 
expenditures, but rather the individual smokers. Plaintiffs' claim that they have spared Defendants the liability and litigation 
expenses is too speculative and remote to constitute a benefit."" Id. at *16. "
1032,1," Because ""federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,"" Matter of County Collector, 96 F.3d 890, 895 (7th Cir. 1996), the 
court has a ""nondelegable duty to police the limits of federal jurisdiction with meticulous care."" Market Street Assocs. Ltd v. Frey, 
941 F.2d 588, 590 (7th Cir. 1991); see also Krueger v. Cartwright, 996 F.2d 928, 930 (7th Cir. 1993); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). It 
does not escape the court's attention that there are jurisdictional issues in this case. First, because International's complaint "
1033,," includes allegations against ""unknown members"" of AABC, the citizenship of those members is unknown. Nonetheless, ""naming 
a John Doe defendant will not defeat the named defendants' right to remove a diversity case if their citizenship is diverse from 
that of the plaintiffs."" Howell v. Tribune Entertain. Co., 106 F.3d 215, 218 (7th Cir. 1997); see also Salzstein v. Bekins Van Lines, 
Inc., 747 F. Supp. 1281, 1283 n.4 (N.D. Ill. 1990). The named party here, AABC, is, standing alone, of diverse citizenship. 
However, certain membership organizations ""take the citizenship of each member."" Indiana Gas Co., Inc., v. Home Ins. Co., 141 
F.3d 314, 316 (7th Cir. 1998); Nat'l Assoc. of Realtors v. Nat'l Real Estate Assoc., 894 F.2d 937, 940 (7th Cir. 1990) (citizenship 
of incorporated trade association was that of its members because the members were the real parties in interest); Nat' Assoc. of 
Realtors, 699 F. Supp. 678, 679 n. 3 (N.D. Ill. 1988). On the other hand, ""for purposes of diversity jurisdiction[,] a corporation is a 
corporation is a corporation."" Cote v. Wadel, 796 F.2d 981, 983 (7th Cir. 1986). If AABC assumes the citizenship of its members, 
then jurisdiction may be absent because AABC has admitted in its later pleadings that it has one member in Illinois (citizenship 
unknown) (see Def.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 7.), the state where International is a citizen. With an abundance of caution, the court 
proceeds under Cote, and concludes that diversity jurisdiction exists because the citizenship of International is diverse from the 
citizenship of AABC. See Nat'l Assoc. of Realtors, 894 F.2d at 939-40 (concluding that for diversity purposes, the inquiry into the 
relevant citizenship of an incorporated trade association depends upon whether the members or the association are the real 
parties in interest)."
1033,2," In at least one part of the record, there is a reference to an additional complaint filed against International prior to the 
complaints filed in early 1997. (See Def.'s Mem. in Opp'n at Ex. 4.). That complaint, lodged by Western in October 1996, 
accused International of failing to complete its work. Because neither party provides further elaboration on that complaint, the 
court will not deem it relevant for purposes of this discussion. "

1050,1," It is uncertain why the plaintiffs so vigorously demanded to rejoin the labor and delivery schedule. Although the record is not

Journal 1593, 1613 (1980) (""From the history of Sherman Act litigation, it is apparent that reliance upon a presumption of 
illegality is likely to arise where the facts induce a conclusion that joint action is directly displacing the competitive process or 
some central goal of the competitive process. The more central the goal being displaced, (price competition as the mechanism 
for establishing price and allocating resources) the more likely a presumption of illegality and the more conclusive the 
presumption. The less clear the goals of antitrust policy involved or the more confused anticompetitive effects become with 
procompetitive effects as a result of the practice (vertical territorial restrains), the less conclusive the presumption allocating 
burdens of proof. Where no immediate impact on the goals of antitrust policy is perceived, no presumptions are created; and, a 
plaintiff must show under all the circumstances that there is a restraint which unreasonably displaces the competitive process as 
the rule of trade."") "

unhelpful, to the issue before the court. Brown does not discuss whether the court applied the per se or Rule of Reason analysis.

disconnected from the facts incorporating all 38 paragraphs by reference. With rare exceptions, see paragraphs 78 and 91, the 
reader is left to guess which of the alleged facts apply to which cause of action. Fortunately, defendant's previous motion to 
dismiss forced plaintiff to link alleged facts which claims alleged. Short of that, the pleading would have been totally indefinite. "
1105,1," According to Lloyd, six different companies in the United States compete with each other to manufacture and sell floor mats for 
Mercedes vehicles."
1105,2," A 1994 study by Mercedes showed that among ""select"" (i.e., premium) car manufacturers floor mats are standard equipment 
on Audis, Cadillacs, Infinitis, Jaguars (some models), Lincolns, Saabs and Volvos. Mats are ""dealer installed"" on Acuras, BMW's 
and Lexuses. Only Porsche still treats mats as optional equipment, among luxury carmakers. "
1106,3," Lloyd later added as a defendant one Mercedes dealership, respondent Caliber Motors, Inc. Lloyd makes no argument on 
appeal with respect to its claims against Caliber Motors, thereby waiving any claim of error in the trial court's judgment in favor of

1107,5," There is no basis in law or reason to conclude that one part of a new car is a separate product merely because that part is

Nevertheless, when all the parts are packaged together to form a new car, it is one product."

1108,7," Evidently aware that the Town Sound opinion is fatal to its claims, Lloyd argues that the opinion has been supplanted by 
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., supra, 504 U.S. 451. The facts of the Kodak case are entirely 
distinguishable from Town Sound and the case at bench. Kodak, which controlled 100 percent of the parts market for its 
photocopiers, attempted to monopolize photocopier repairs by refusing to supply replacement parts to independent copier repair 
companies, thereby forcing consumers who were already ""locked in"" to have their broken copiers serviced by Kodak and Kodak 
alone. An analogy to Kodak might be drawn if Mercedes were refusing to supply otherwise unobtainable Mercedes replacement 
parts to independent car repair shops in order to force consumers to have their cars repaired at Mercedes dealerships. That is 
not remotely what this case is about. Consumers factor in the quality of the standard floor mats before they purchase the car or 
are ""locked in."""
1108,8," Otherwise stated, HN6[

impact of the invention on the industry, and the commercial value of its practice.  Reuter, 670 F.2d at 1021 n.9. "
1120,2," Defendants admit that the absence of talc as a lubricant in the Deadball would have prevented a valid infringement action 
under the '504 patent. (See Mem. of Pts. & Auth. in Supp. of Motion for Summ. Adjud. Of Issues that Deadball Is Not Prior Art at 
5.)"
1120,3," Defendants' rely extensively on Hebert v. Lisle Corp., 99 F.3d 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and specifically its alleged similarity to this 
case. But the Federal Circuit emphasized there that the basis of its invalidation of the jury verdict of unenforceability based on 
inequitable conduct was the fact that no evidence whatsoever was introduced that the information submitted to the patent holder 
was in fact prior art. See Hebert, 99 F.3d at 1115 (""Lisle's patent expert did not testify that the omitted information was prior art. 
… No submission was offered or described as 'prior art' to the Hebert invention."") When there is literally no evidence that a party 
had prior art material, it is of course impossible for a factfinder to decide from an examination of the evidence that the party's 
decision to withhold prior art was willful. Here, there is evidence indicating that the Deadball was in fact prior art, and plaintiff's 
patent expert is prepared to testify that it was. Though Hebert certainly counsels a court to be careful in allowing final decisions 
by factfinders where no evidence of materiality is presented by a patent challenger, and underscores the burden on plaintiff to 
present evidence at trial to avoid a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), it does not mandate summary judgment at this time. "
1121,4, Defendant's motion to strike is DENIED without prejudice.

1142,1, Some plaintiffs are both end users and ISOs. Plaintiff Olde York Valley Inn is only an end user.
1142,2," End users have a third option for service of their PBXs-self-service-whereby they purchase the parts and software they need 
from Rolm and perform the maintenance themselves. The parties agree that these three alternatives-Rolm, ISOs, and self-
service-are the only three service options available to end users. Self-service only accounts for a small portion of all service 
performed on Rolm PBXs, however. "
1143,3," HN1[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides that ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, shall be guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, allows 
any person injured by a violation of the antitrust laws to sue for damages."
1143,4," For purposes of their antitrust claims, plaintiffs do not dispute that Rolm's intellectual property rights are valid. In response to 
Rolm's counterclaims for copyright and patent infringement, however, plaintiffs do dispute the validity of those rights. "
1144,5," Plaintiffs vigorously deny that this is a ""refusal to deal"" case. Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 1-2. Although defendant recognizes that plaintiffs' claims include allegations of anticompetitive conduct other than 
refusing to sell parts and software to plaintiffs and restricts its statute of limitations argument to those claims that are based on 
the alleged refusal to deal, the Court agrees with defendant that the overwhelming majority of plaintiffs' alleged damages appear 
to stem from the refusal to deal. "
1146,6," The Court notes, however, that in order to recover for any injury arising out of an alleged refusal to deal, each plaintiff must 
demonstrate that it made a genuine request to purchase parts from Rolm during the limitations period and that such request was 
denied.  Midwestern Waffles, 734 F.2d at 715."
1146,7," The Court recognizes that, under Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3, opinions that are not designated for publication are not precedential. 
However, as this Court is not bound by Ninth Circuit decisions, this rule is of no moment here. The Court simply finds the opinion 
instructive on the issue presented in this case. "
1147,8," HN9[
] Cross-elasticity of demand is defined as ""the extent to which consumers will change their consumption of one product 
in response to a price change in another."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 469, 112 S. Ct. at 2083."
1147,9," It is important to note, however, that unlike the usual case involving cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties do not 
agree that the question of relevant market can be decided as a matter of law regardless of the definition that is ultimately 
adopted. Rather, plaintiffs and defendant argue that the facts that are material to the inquiry are undisputed and they support a "
1148,," finding of a certain relevant market. They disagree, however, about what facts are material. Consequently, they argue that if the 
Court is inclined to accept the opposing view of the relevant market, genuine issues of material fact preclude the Court from 
doing so as a matter of law."
1148,10," This market definition is consistent with the view that ""relevant market"" for antitrust purposes is defined by the ""products that 
have a sufficient competitive impact on the product of the defendant to be considered collectively in deciding whether the 
defendant possesses monopoly power."" Earl W. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 12.3. To the extent that this definition of 
relevant market refers to the concept of monopoly power--defined as the ability to charge supracompetitive prices for an 
extended period of time--it is somewhat circular. It demonstrates an important point about the arguments advanced here, 
however. Under defendant's definition of relevant market, the question of the percentage of Rolm PBXs to which Rolm provides service is 
irrelevant. Even if it were established that Rolm serviced virtually all of the Rolm PBXs, and, therefore, arguably could be said to 
have a monopoly share of that market, service for Rolm PBXs cannot be the ""relevant market"" for antitrust purposes, according 
to defendant, because competition in the sale of PBXs prevents Rolm from charging supracompetitive prices for service. Thus, 
for purposes of the instant motions, the concepts of ""relevant market"" and ""monopoly power"" are essentially indistinguishable. 
The Supreme Court recognized the conflation of these concepts Kodak. See Kodak, 504 U.S. at 469 n.15, 112 S. Ct. at 2083 
n.15. "
1149,11," The Court notes, however, that even if it accepted Rolm's reading of Kodak, plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to 
withstand defendant's motion for summary judgment. First, Rolm's own lifecycle expert, John Anderson, testified that he is paid 
between $ 7,000 and $ 60,000 to conduct PBX lifecycle analyses for consumers. Dep. of John Anderson, pp. 309-312. Second, 
evidence in the record suggests that the average consumer expenditure for a Rolm PBX in 1992 and 1993 was $ 438,239. 
Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Ex. 31 at EDM 002037. This figure is more than twice as 
much as the expenditure required to purchase the most expensive equipment at issue in Kodak, in which the Supreme Court 
found that there was sufficient evidence of high switching costs to withstand the defendant's motion for summary judgment. 
Plaintiffs' Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, Ex. 229. Finally, regardless of whether Rolm's conduct in January 1990 
constituted an announcement of a final policy of refusing to sell parts directly to ISOs, the record contains sufficient evidence to 
support a finding that, prior to that time, Rolm sold parts directly to ISOs. See section II.B.1.a, supra. This demonstrates the 
existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether end users who purchased Rolm PBXs prior to that time 
became ""locked-in"" to their purchases as a result of this change. "
1150,12," To reiterate, HN13[
] the elements for plaintiffs' monopolization claim are: 1) the possession by Rolm of monopoly power in 
the relevant market; and 2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power (as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident). Plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim consists 
of three elements: 1) predatory or anticompetitive engaged in by defendant; 2) specific intent to monopolize; and 3) a dangerous 
probability of achieving monopoly power in the relevant market. Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 S. 
Ct. 884, 892, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993). "
1151,13," Although Justice Brennan dissented in Celotex, he agreed with the majority's analysis of Rule 56. He believed, however, that 
the majority did not adequately explain what is required of the moving party. "
1152,14," Although all PBXs come with software installed, Rolm periodically produces ""upgraded"" software that works with the same 
PBX system. Plaintiffs are accused of providing their customers with these upgrades by copying them from other customers. "
1153,15," The Court recognizes that plaintiffs only contend that ""Rolm failed to obtain registration until more than five years after almost 
every software title had been publicly distributed."" Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 5 
(emphasis added). Therefore, it appears that plaintiffs concede that at least some of the registrations constituted prima facie 
evidence of validity. However, as the moving party with respect to this motion, Rolm bears the burden of demonstrating that it is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of its claims, and it has not attempted to break down its claims with respect to 
each of the nineteen software titles it alleges that plaintiffs infringed."
1153,16," The standard governing this motion is set forth above. See pp. 5-6, supra. "
1154,17," The Court recognizes that defendant did respond to plaintiffs' initial attack on the sufficiency of its evidence with respect to 
Count X, directing the Court to the ""numerous issues of fact presented by each element of that claim"" allegedly demonstrated by 
defendant's statement of material facts that were in dispute. However, plaintiffs' specifically attacked the sufficiency of the 
evidence cited by defendant in their reply brief, and although the Court allowed defendant to file a surreply in support of its 
opposition to this motion, defendant did not respond to this attack therein."
1154,18," Plaintiffs offer an additional, ""closely related"" argument that defendant has granted them an implied license with respect to the 
patents-in-suit. This inquiry is also fact-intensive, and the Court finds that summary adjudication of this issue is not appropriate 
based on the record before it."
1154,19," Contrary to plaintiffs' assertion, the Eleventh Circuit has not ""acknowledged that copyright misuse could in an appropriate case 
be used as a defense to discipline those who abuse their copyrights."" As an initial matter, the Court notes that the case that 
plaintiffs cite for this proposition, BellSouth Advertising & Publishing Corp. v. Donnelley Information Publishing, 933 F.2d 952 
(11th Cir. 1991) was vacated en banc. Furthermore, although the vacated opinion stated that the judicially recognized patent 
misuse defense might someday be extended to copyright law, the court expressly declined to do so in that case.  Id. at 961. "
1155,20," The Court recognizes that some courts have reached the contrary conclusion on this issue. E.g., MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak 
Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993) (software licensee not ""owner"" for purposes of section 117); Advanced Computer 
Servs. of Mich., Inc. v. MAI Sys. Corp., 845 F. Supp. 356 (E.D. Va. 1994) (same); CMAX/Cleveland, Inc. v. UCR, Inc., 804 F. 
Supp. 337 (M.D. Ga. 1992) (same). Many of these decisions, however, have been criticized in one of the leading treatises on 
copyright law. See 2 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 8.08[B][1] & nn. 37-38.1 (1998). The Court 
notes that defendant has cited this treatise as authoritative on at least one occasion in this litigation."
1155,21," Although Rolm notes that its software license provides that any ""modifications to, or new releases or versions of, the software 
will be provided subject to this Agreement at applicable charges,"" this does not change the fact an end user only pays a single 
price for each copy of software that is licensed to it under the agreement. "
1156,22," For example, while plaintiffs argue that Rolm does not enforce the formalities relating to transfer that are contained in its 
licensing agreement, this is clearly a question for the jury."
1156,23," The Court notes, however, that if, in fact, the plaintiffs are not bound by Rolm's software license, then these claims would be 
preempted under the Copyright Act because the claims would essentially amount to allegations that plaintiffs did something that 
the copyright laws reserve exclusively to Rolm, such as unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or display. See American Movie 
Classics Co. v. Turner Entertainment Co., 922 F. Supp. 926, 931 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (also noting that an action will not be saved 
from preemption by elements such as intent, which alter the action's scope but not its nature). "
1157,24," The question of likelihood of confusion is central not only to Rolm's claims under the Lanham Act, but also to its claims under 
Georgia law. See University of Ga. Athletic Ass'n v. Laite, 756 F.2d 1535, 1539 n.11 (11th Cir. 1985)."
1157,25," The Court recognizes that plaintiffs alternatively contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on the issue of damages 
because such an award under the Lanham Act requires a showing of actual confusion, which plaintiffs claim is lacking here. See 
Web Printing Controls Co. v. Oxy-Dry Corp., 906 F.2d 1202, 1204-05 (7th Cir. 1990). Although the Court agrees that there is 
little evidence of actual confusion in the record before it, defendant has also moved for injunctive relief under the Lanham Act, 
which requires only a showing of likelihood of confusion. In light of the factual issues that exist on this question, the Court will not 
preclude defendant from attempting to establish actual confusion at trial."
1157,26," In further support of their contention that the materials were not ""trade secrets,"" plaintiffs argue that the materials were readily 
available from third-parties. Assuming this to be true, however, plaintiffs have not cited any binding authority for the proposition 
that this fact precludes recovery for misappropriation of trade secrets as a matter of law. "
1158,27," Plaintiffs' motion is granted with respect to Count X, Count XV, Count XVI, the claims asserted against Start Technologies 
Corporation, Olde York Valley Inn, and DD Hawkins Communications, Inc. in Counts II, III, and IV, and defendant's claims for 
""computer copying infringement."" It is denied with respect to all other claims. "
1164,1," Brunswick manufactures MerCruiser stern drive engines. The Court will refer to ""Brunswick"" and ""MerCruiser"" interchangeably. "
1165,2," The jury rejected Plaintiffs' claim of fraudulent concealment, thus limiting damages to the beginning of the limitations period, 
December 7, 1991. The jury also rejected Plaintiffs' claims for prospective damages. After trebling, the verdict is approximately $ 
133 Million. "
1167,3," The Court notes that there were substantial factual disputes at trial concerning the significance of these events that purportedly 
increased MerCruiser's market share. "
1168,4," Even if Brunswick had appropriately raised these issues with respect to Dr. Hall's damage opinion, it is unlikely that Dr. Hall's 
decision to use the same damage figure would be any cause for concern. Plaintiffs challenged a variety of unlawful conduct, 
some instances of which, understandably, were more serious than others. The two incidents at issue here were minor in 
comparison to the other conduct, and it highly unlikely that they would have impacted the damage calculation in any meaningful 
way."
1168,5," At trial, Plaintiffs presented evidence that these drastic reductions were part of an anticompetitive scheme to break up large 
buying groups such as IBBI. "
1169,6, Brunswick did not raise either of these arguments prior to trial. 
1170,7," The Third Circuit affirmed the district court in SmithKline. The court's ruling is instructive: ""In sum, the act of willful acquisition and maintenance of monopoly power was brought about by linking products on which 
Lilly faced no competition Keflin and Keflex with a competitive product, Kefzol. The result was to sell all three products on a 
non-competitive basis in what would have otherwise been a competitive market for Ancef and Kefzol…. Were it not for the 
Lilly's [pricing plan], the price, supply, and demand of Kefzol and Ancef would have been determined by the economic laws 
of a competitive market. The Revised CSP blatantly revised those economic laws and made Lilly a transgressor under § 2 
of the Sherman Act. SmithKline v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056, 1065 (3rd Cir. 1978). "
1173,8," Plaintiffs raise a good point with respect to the 100% argument. At what point would courts draw the line if that was in fact the 
law? Could 99% contracts violate the Sherman Act? Apparently under Brunswick's theory they could not, regardless of the 
anticompetitive impact such contracts might have. Such a drastic example reinforces the notion that it is the manifest 
reasonableness and effect of a challenged restraint, not its conclusory label, that is relevant to a Sherman Act rule of reason 
analysis. "

1209,11," Courts have upheld Section One claims in a few other cases in which some of the conspirators had interests that were not

1210,14," For example, the Court explained: ""Our approach to the question presented in the present case is guided by the premises of

[v. Spray-Rite Svc. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984)]: that there is a presumption in favor of a rule-
of-reason standard; that departure from that standard must be justified by demonstrable economic effect, such as the facilitation 
of cartelizing, rather than formalistic distinctions; that interbrand competition is the primary concern of the antitrust laws; and that 
rules in this area should be formulated with a view towards protecting the doctrine of GTE Sylvania."""
1210,15," Accordingly, this opinion vacates and supplants the Court's earlier opinion in this case, Eleven Line, 1998 WL 25566, at *3-*5 
only insofar as it held that the alleged conspiracy was a per se violation of Section One. The Court is not persuaded by plaintiff's 
argument that defendants' activity was in fact a horizontal restraint. See Business Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 
717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988) (""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally

1225,1," Each of the Funds entered into a Public Securities Association Master Repurchase Agreement (""PSA Agreement"") with Bear 
Stearns and DLJ. Merrill Lynch entered into a PSA Agreement with Quartz, but not with Granite Partners or Granite Corp. In 
connection with its repurchase transactions with those funds, Merrill Lynch issued trade confirmations that purported to grant 
Merrill Lynch a security interest in the repoed securities. "
1226,2," One of the tranches of CMOs is the inverse IO. The response of inverse IOs to changes in interest rates is difficult to predict. 
For example, an increase in short-term rates would lead to a decrease in the coupon rate paid on an inverse IO whose coupon 
rate formula was based on LIBOR. The Complaint states that the decrease could be dramatic if leverage was involved. The 
decrease in the coupon rate on the inverse IO would tend to depress its value. If, however, the increase in short-term rates was 
accompanied by an increase in long-term rates, prepayments might decline, extending the payment stream on the inverse IO. 
This would tend to increase its value, perhaps enough to offset the decline in value caused by the reduction in the coupon rate. 
The difficultly in predicting the impact of interest rate changes on inverse IOs makes them risky securities. Inverse IOs are 
particularly toxic when they are leveraged. (Compl. P 32.) "
1227,3," Bear Stearns notes that if the suggestion implies anything, it is that the four bonds are more bullish than the other classes of 
securities, not that they were more bearish, since the suggested hedge is to be smaller. "
1228,4," This allegation, if it were a proper misrepresentation, would nonetheless fail for inadequately pleading reasonable reliance, as 
discussed below."
1228,5," In addition to buying on repo, ACM also purchased CMOs for the Funds on a forward-settling basis, i.e., for settlement 
(payment by the Funds) in the future. In the CMO market, broker-dealers attempt to ""pre-sell"" certain tranches of CMOs before 
the CMO has been issued and settled. Frequently, these so-called ""forwards"" do not settle until several weeks or months after 
the buyer has committed to purchase them. The length of this lead time arises from the need of broker-dealers to assemble the 
collateral for and pre-sell much of the CMO deal, which may involve numerous adjustments to the very complex, multitranche 
structures. "
1230,6," See generally Independent Order of Foresters v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., 919 F. Supp. 149, 154 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(dismissing plaintiff's complaint and holding as a matter of law that no reasonable investor, trading millions of dollars in CMOs, 
would rely on information in a sales brochure in light of the volumes of other information available in highly regulated securities 
transactions); McCoy v. Goldberg, 883 F. Supp. 927, 936 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (dismissing complaint for failure to establish justifiable 
reliance where plaintiffs ignored information in prospectus and instead relied on information in summaries). "
1231,7," The LAB's claims for negligent and innocent misrepresentation, discussed below, may also be dismissed for lack of adequately 
pleading justifiable reliance. See generally Kimmell v. Schaefer, 89 N.Y.2d 257, 263-64, 675 N.E.2d 450, 454, 652 N.Y.S.2d

(stating that if the ""element of scienter is subtracted from a cause of action for fraud, the remainder constitutes innocent 
misrepresentation"")."
1231,8," The Martin Act does not preclude private litigants from bringing common law fraud claims because such claims require a 
plaintiff to prove intent or scienter. Therefore, courts allow these claims to proceed while simultaneously dismissing negligent 
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty claims. See e.g., Whitehall Tenants Corp. v. Estate of Olnick, 213 A.D.2d 200, 
623 N.Y.S.2d 585 (1st Dep't), appeal denied, 86 N.Y.2d 704, 631 N.Y.S.2d 608 (1995). "
1237,9," The BMA, as amicus curiae, has submitted a memorandum to enlighten the Court about repos in general and their importance 
to the debt capital markets. The discussion in this subsection is based primarily on the BMA's amicus curiae brief. "
1238,10," Repos involving U.S. Treasury securities are also used by the Federal Reserve System as its primary tool for implementation 
of monetary policy. See In re Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corp., 878 F.2d 742, 745 (3d Cir. 1989)."
1238,11," As stated by the BMA, the repo market fosters important interrelationships among the different types of fixed-income 
securities. The market for federal agency securities, and the fixed-income markets generally, are closely linked to the market for 
Treasury securities: the price of an agency security is generally expressed in terms of its ""spread"" over Treasury securities of 
comparable maturity, and dealers quickly act on arbitrages between Treasury and agency security markets. See 1992 Joint 
Report at D-4 to D-5. Rapid movements of securities through repos and reverse repos facilitate this process and are thus among 
a number of financial mechanisms that contribute to the smooth functioning of the nation's fixed-income markets. "
1239,12," Consideration of the agreements themselves is appropriate on the motion to dismiss because the LAB must rely on the 
agreements to prove contractual relations with the Brokers, the LAB had notice of them when the action was filed, and the LAB 
itself utilizes them in its opposition papers. See Belin, 1998 WL 391114, at *3-*4; see also San Leandro Emergency Med. Group 
Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 808-09 (2d Cir. 1996) (permitting consideration of the full text of 
documents ""integral"" to plaintiff's claim on motion to dismiss); Barnum v. Millbrook Care Ltd. Partnership, 850 F. Supp. 1227, 
1230 (S.D.N.Y.) (finding reference to the full text of a contract on a motion to dismiss appropriate even though the plaintiff had 
not formally incorporated it by reference), aff'd, 43 F.3d 1458 (2d Cir. 1994). "
1241,13," The operative provisions of the PSA Agreement conform to this stated intention. The parties are denominated ""Buyer"" and 
""Seller,"" they agree that on the ""Purchase Date"" for a transaction the ""Purchased Securities"" will be transferred to the ""Buyer"" or 
its agent against payment of the ""Purchase Price."" On the ""Repurchase Date,"" this process occurs in reverse. The parties further 
acknowledge the difference between their repo transactions and conventional secured indebtedness by agreeing that each 
""Transaction"" is a ""repurchase agreement"" and a ""securities contract"" entitled to the benefits of special protective provisions 
under the Bankruptcy Code. Perhaps most telling, the parties agree that the title to the Purchased Securities passes to the 
Buyer, who is explicitly permitted to engage in repos with the Purchased Securities or otherwise transfer or hypothecate them. 
See Drysdale, 785 F.2d at 41. Under prevailing market practice, the Buyer, as owner, may sell the Purchased Securities. "
1242,14," The BMA also maintains that Article 9 would impinge upon repo participants' rights with respect to repo securities in the 
nondefault context. The BMA uses, as an example, section 9-207, which prescribes the rights and duties of a secured party 
holding collateral in its possession. While section 9-207(2)(e) provides that ""the secured party may repledge the collateral upon 
terms which do not impair the debtor's right to redeem it,"" it does not permit a secured party to sell or dispose of the collateral in 
its possession. The application of Article 9 would negate a repo buyer's contractual right to freely sell the repo securities and 
may hamper the repo buyer's right to rehypothecate the repo securities. These rights of the repo buyer are inherent features of 
repo transactions, key to their value to the capital markets. "
1243,15," Additionally, the LAB's allegation that the forward contracts between the Funds and Bear Stearns resulted in secured loans is 
unsupported and therefore dismissed. "
1245,16," As an initial matter, the LAB contends that their tort claim is to be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands and Delaware 
because the Funds were organized under the laws of those jurisdictions. New York law, however, governs this cause of action. It 
was brought in a New York federal court by and against entities and individuals located in New York and based on facts alleged 
to have occurred in New York. Significantly, the disposition of the claim - that the Brokers induced and participated in a breach of 
fiduciary duty by a money manager of investment funds - is vitally important to the financial industry, which is centered in New 
York. For these reasons, New York substantive law applies to the claim and, therefore, to the applicability of the Brokers' in pari 
delicto defense discussed below. See Brink's Ltd. v. South African Airways, 93 F.3d 1022, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 
U.S. 1116, 136 L. Ed. 2d 845, 117 S. Ct. 959 (1997). The LAB cites to this Court's decision in ABF Capital Management v. Askin Capital Management, L.P., 957 F. Supp. 1308, 1331 
(S.D.N.Y. 1997), for the proposition that its claim for inducing and participating in breach of fiduciary duty will be governed by 
Cayman Islands and Delaware law. Yet, the LAB misreads the decision. In discussing whether investors in the Funds had 
standing to bring aiding and abetting claims against broker-dealers, this Court in ABF merely held that the investors' claims are 
derivative claims under Cayman Islands and Delaware law. Id. A choice of law analysis to determine which law should apply to 
the aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim was not performed at that time. As noted recently in Solow v. Stone, 994 F. 
Supp. 173 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), under New York's choice of law rules, the law of the state of incorporation controls a breach of 
fiduciary duty claim while New York law controls the plaintiff's claim for aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty because 
the acts giving rise to the claim took place, in significant part, in New York.  Id. at 177."
1245,17," Quartz was intended to be market-directional. Despite concerns about rising interest rates, which dictated the purchase of 
bearish securities, Askin and ACM breached their duties by acquiring for Quartz the same bullish CMOs they were buying for 
Granite Corp. and Granite Partners. "
1247,18," It is appropriate to resolve this issue on a motion to dismiss if, as the Brokers contend, the LAB's pleading alleges that Askin 
and ACM, the Funds' sole decisionmakers, and the Brokers were equal wrongdoers as a matter of law. See Ross, 904 F.2d at 
826; In re Haven Indus., Inc., 462 F. Supp. 172, 180 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). "
1248,19," It is the same intentional conduct that formed the basis for Judge Bernstein's finding that the Funds' Trustee was barred from 
pursuing a claim on behalf of the Funds' debtor estates for inducing and participating in a breach of fiduciary duty against the 
broker-dealers because the Funds were in pari delicto with them. See Granite I, 194 B.R. at 330. Contrary to the LAB's contention, Askin and ACM need not only have deliberately bought inappropriate securities to have 
engaged in intentional wrongdoing such that in pari delicto may be applied. The factual allegations concerning the computer 
models, for example, smell of fraud."
1248,20," It is useful to note that to succeed in an inducing and participating in a breach of fiduciary duty claim, a requirement of 
""knowledge"" is sufficient. The factual allegations in the Complaint demonstrate as much regarding Askin and ACM. According to Merrill Lynch, it seems illogical to claim that a defendant's culpability for inducing and participating in a breach of 
fiduciary duty can ever be greater than that of the fiduciary himself. As the Supreme Court stated in Bateman Eichler, which is 
cited by the LAB, ""we do not believe that a person whose liability is solely derivative can be said to be as culpable as one whose 
breach of duty gave rise to the liability in the first place."" 472 U.S. at 313 (speaking in the context of insider trading). "
1249,21," The ""unclean hands"" doctrine also provides grounds for dismissing the other claims through which the LAB seeks equitable 
relief: unjust enrichment and innocent representation, for example. As discussed above, the innocent representation claim is 
also barred by the Martin Act (as well as failure to plead justifiable reliance), and, as discussed below, the unjust enrichment

particular challenge to this historical shift toward a vertically integrated service system by the defendants."" (Seaman's Exp. Rep.

1321,17," Market power can also be demonstrated by direct evidence that defendants raised prices and drove out competition in the tied

business practices within the meaning of section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code (hereafter section 17200.) We 
need not separately address the section 17200 claim as its validity depends on whether appellants have adequately alleged a 
cause of action under the Cartwright Act. "
1333,2," Many cases state that section 16720 was patterned after section 1 of the Sherman Act and that federal law construing section 
1 is applicable to resolve problems arising under section 16720. (See, e.g., Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, 
Inc., supra, 4 Cal. 3d at p. 852; Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 920, 925 [130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549

3d at page 1168, our Supreme Court stated that ""the Sherman Act is not, contrary to our past statements, directly probative on 
interpretation of the Cartwright Act."" Though not always directly probative of the Cartwright Act drafters' intent, judicial 
interpretations of the Sherman Act are, nevertheless, often helpful because of the similarity in language and purpose between 
the federal and state statutes. ( Id. at p. 1164; Biljac Associates v. First Interstate Bank, supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1420-
1421.) "
1334,3," At oral argument, appellants' counsel argued for the first time during this appeal that there are two tied product markets in this 
case, i.e., that ""cable programming"" is the tied product with respect to some of the activities challenged in the first amended 
complaint. As we have noted, the first amended complaint does allege that Viacom customers are required to purchase satellite cable 
channels in order to purchase premium channels. However, appellants have clearly failed to allege sufficient facts to support a 
claim that Viacom illegally ties their premium cable service to their satellite cable service. Not only have appellants failed to 
allege injury to competition in the satellite cable market or damage to them resulting from such an injury, they have not even 
alleged facts to establish that satellite channels and premium channels constitute distinct product markets. The first amended complaint also alleges that, at some unspecified time in the past, Viacom required that customers purchase 
satellite cable channels in order to purchase broadcast channels, but that Viacom discontinued this practice ""[a]t some time prior 
to the initiation of this action."" Since this alleged practice was not at issue in the lower court and is never even mentioned in the 
appellate briefs, we assumed that appellants had abandoned any plan they may have had to use this alleged business practice 
as a basis of an antitrust claim against Viacom. However, in light of appellants' counsel's reference at oral argument to a tied 
product market consisting of cable programming, we note just a few reasons why allegations regarding Viacom's former practice 
of requiring customers to purchase broadcast channels in order to purchase satellite channels do not state an antitrust cause of 
action: (1) the first amended complaint does not allege that Viacom engaged in this practice during the four-year period prior to 
the filing of the original complaint in this action; (2) there is no allegation that this alleged practice restrained trade in the market 
for satellite cable channels; (3) appellants have not alleged any injury resulting from restraint on competition in the market for 
satellite cable television; (4) there is no allegation that Viacom has or had sufficient market power in the broadcast television 
market to coerce a sale in the satellite cable market. (Indeed, with respect to this last point, appellants implicitly concede they 
were not coerced to purchase satellite channels in order to obtain broadcast channels by admitting that broadcast channels are 
transmitted over the airwaves free of charge.) "

1346,3," In Raiders I the Ninth Circuit held that Article 4.3 had impermissibly foreclosed competition between stadia seeking NFL 
tenants and granted exclusive territories to NFL teams. 726 F.2d at 1395. Future applications of the rule could withstand 
scrutiny, however, if the NFL adopted objective factors for consideration by team owners before voting, as well as clarified 
procedures including an opportunity for any applicant to make a presentation to the league. Id. at 1397. The NFL commissioner 
subsequently issued such guidelines. CVC complains that the guidelines and the rule have had the effect of discouraging 
competitive bidding for available stadia, thereby driving up the cost for a locality seeking a team."
1346,4," These factors include consideration of the adequacy of the team's current stadium, the extent of demonstrated fan support for 
the team, and the extent to which the owner has contributed to the need for relocation."
1346,5," The relocation fee was described by the commissioner as reflecting among other things the increased value of the team after 
the move to St. Louis and the value of that franchise opportunity compared to Anaheim."
1346,6," The record is not clear on when the NFL owners learned about CVC's agreement to contribute to any relocation fee. John 
Shaw testified that he informed Commissioner Tagliabue of the agreement before the April 12 vote, but on cross he said that he 
had withheld information about the agreement from the NFL and team owners and had insisted that CVC do the same. 
Tagliabue testified that he did not inform the owners about CVC's undertaking in regard to the fee until after they had voted. "
1352,7," The cited cases involved situations which could amount to a per se violation of the antitrust laws. In a rule of reason case like 
this one, where there is an issue as to the cause of the lack of competitive bidding, evidence about whether the alleged 
agreement affected the actions of the other team owners is relevant, as is evidence tending to exclude independent action."
1352,8," CVC claims that eight teams had expressed interest in moving since 1991, but the testimony it cites in support contains no 
indication that any team was interested in moving in 1995, CVC's deadline for a team. It cites the deposition testimony of New "
1353,," Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson who said that teams had expressed interest in St. Louis, but Benson did not identify any 
teams or the nature of any interest. CVC also does not cite any support elsewhere in the record for Shaw's testimony that the 
Houston Oilers, Cincinnati Bengals, and New England Patriots could move. CVC argues that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were available to move, citing the deposition testimony of a league official. That 
official stated, however, that the team would have had to pay a penalty on its lease in order to relocate, and CVC does not point 
to any testimony by team officials indicating they were prepared to move. Senator Eagleton testified, however, that Jerry Clinton 
had negotiated with the Buccaneers and claimed he could bring them to St. Louis on the same terms as the Rams if an 
additional $ 5 million were made available, but Eagleton did not indicate why St. Louis had not attempted to create a competitive 
bidding situation between the teams. CVC also claims that the Minnesota Vikings were available, citing testimony by Senator Eagleton, but Eagleton testified that 
FANS concluded that the Vikings were not interested in St. Louis. "

1358,2," The phrase ""joint venture"" is often used to describe a venture, other than one engaged in naked per se violations (like a price

For simplicity, the Court will refer to the ""Stern Drive Plaintiffs"" as the ""Plaintiffs"" instead of the ""Counter-Defendants."""
1368,2," For a discussion of the per se unlawful nature of this alleged conspiracy, see the Court's Order dated March 18, 1998. In their 
motion, Plaintiffs invite the Court to reconsider this finding. The Court declines to do so. The aspects of this boycott which 
rendered it per se unlawful are just as present following the close of the evidence as they were at the summary judgment phase. 
Furthermore, the issue here is not whether there are pro-competitive reasons for the existence of purchasing cooperatives. The 
issue here is whether IBBI and its members' actions exceeded the scope of lawful buying group activity. "
1369,3," The futility of a certain course of action might be relevant to the issue of liability if the evidence requires inferences to be drawn 
as to the existence of an agreement. But it is not relevant where the existence of the agreement is undisputed or blatantly 
obvious. "
1370,4," The court in City of Mt. Pleasant noted that the critical inquiry is whether the alleged antitrust conspirators have a ""unity of 
interests"" or whether, instead, ""any of the defendants has pursued interests diverse from those of the cooperative itself."" City of 
Mt. Pleasant, 838 F.2d at 274-77. The Eighth Circuit defined ""diverse"" as ""interests which tend to show that any two of the 
defendants are, or have been, actual or potential competitors"" Id. All of the members of IBBI compete in the sale of recreational 
boats. "
1372,5," IBBI serves as a ""conduit"" through which many small companies are able to aggregate their buying power. With respect to 
engines, this aggregation of buying power is extremely beneficial, as the engine is by far the most expensive component of a 
completed boat."
1372,6," The Court is not saying that IBBI, as an organization, had no interest in the boycott. Clearly it did, because one of the stated 
objectives of the boycott was to preserve IBBI's status as a significant purchasing cooperative. However, the primary benefits 
flowing from the boycott, i.e., the financial benefits of the boycott, would ultimately flow to the individual members."
1372,7," Plaintiffs presented evidence at trial that Brunswick drastically lowered the volume discount threshold as part of an 
anticompetitive scheme to fragment large buying groups such as IBBI. Thus, it is not surprising that IBBI and the board members 
were pursuing this course of action. But again, their motivation in entering into the agreement is not relevant here. "
1374,8," These companies did not join the conspiracy merely by virtue of the fact that they were members of IBBI at the conspiracy's 
inception. Brunswick was required to demonstrate that these companies individually agreed to participate in the unlawful 
conspiracy."
1374,9," Several Plaintiffs joined IBBI after the conspiracy period and several IBBI members during the conspiracy period were never 
parties in this lawsuit."
1374,10," This an unlikely proposition because of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Brunswick maintains an exception applies in this 
instance, but there merits of that particular position are not relevant to this hypothetical. "
1375,11," Both Fulks and Hirdes, the only board members that testified, denied that Mariah or Powerquest even reduced their 
MerCruiser purchases. Brunswick presented no evidence that they did (other than to point out that they were in IBBI during the 
conspiracy)."
1375,12," This situation is in marked contrast to the position Brunswick advocated with respect to Dr. Hall, who did not use a ""before-
and-after"" damage model. Dr. Hall testified that all market factors were taken into account before arriving at the hypothetical 
market division, and it was clear from the evidence that he did in fact take all of the market factors into account. In contrast, Dr. 
Rapp simply admitted that he did not even consider obvious market factors present in the benchmark and conspiracy periods. 
Additionally, the evidence reflected that Dr. Rapp was unaware that Plaintiffs Armada and Caravelle purchased over 400 
engines from OMC during the benchmark period, a fact that, to use the words of Dr. Rapp, could ""mean the damages are too 
big."" Tr. at 5496. Dr. Rapp's eventual explanation for failing to take the OMC purchases into account was not persuasive. "
1381,1," Shortly before trial, Utah Foam successfully argued to the district court that Upjohn's PAPI 135 records were relevant to its

scheduled start of trial, the court limited discovery of those records to those already prepared by Upjohn (years 1983-1985). The 
court refused to order production of PAPI 135 records from earlier years, on the grounds that so doing would cause real 
prejudice to Upjohn. "
1383,2," We disagree with Utah Foam's argument that the grant of summary judgment against it on its state discriminatory pricing claim

1408,5," State law claims for breach of contract, conversion, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, arising out of Rossi's contractual 
relationships with Standard, were dismissed without prejudice and are not under review here. "
1409,6," We have also recently discussed a third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards. In our 
jurisprudence, we refer to this middle ground as an abbreviated or ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis. See Orson, Inc. v. 
Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1367 n.9 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d Cir. 1993)). 
This ""quick look"" analysis applies ""where per se condemnation is inappropriate, but where a full-blown industry analysis is not 
required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of an inherently suspect restraint."" Id."
1409,7," In Business Elecs., the Supreme Court indicated that the rationale behind applying the rule of reason to vertical non-price 
restraints is that such restraints have the potential to promote inter-brand competition, the ""primary concern of the antitrust laws,"" 
over intra-brand competition. See 485 U.S. at 724-25 (citations omitted). "
1410,8," The Courts of Appeals have differed in their application of this language. The Seventh Circuit has held that ""once control over 
an important resource appears, no justification for a refusal to deal can be considered."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 
1510 (interpreting Fishman v. Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 541 (7th Cir. 1986) (holding that a concerted refusal to deal is illegal per se if 
the ""defendants have either market power or exclusive access to an element essential to effective competition."") (internal quotes "
1411,," omitted)). The Eighth and Ninth Circuits have focused on the number of horizontal players in the alleged conspiracy and have 
found no per se rule against boycotts in situations where the conspirators included only a single supplier and a single retailer in 
competition with the plaintiff. See id. (discussing Lomar Wholesale Grocery, Inc. v. Dieter's Gourmet Foods, Inc., 824 F.2d 582, 
591 (8th Cir. 1987) (""there must be some collusion between competitors on the same market level,"" for otherwise the ""net 
economic impact of refusals to deal"" is not ""immediately obvious"") and Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 729, 
734 (9th Cir. 1987)). The implication of these holdings would seem to be that the result differs as the number of parties to the 
conspiracy grows. This Court has tended to follow the Eighth and Ninth Circuits and has seemingly been more willing than some 
others, see, e.g., K.M.B. Warehouse Dists., Inc. v. Walker Manuf. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) (viewing an alleged 
agreement among a vertical manufacturer and three horizontal distributors as a vertical non-price-fixing conspiracy subject to the 
rule of reason, not per se, analysis), to find an horizontal per se violation when a small number of dealers have prevailed upon a 
manufacturer or supplier to cut off a price discounter. See, e.g., Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1376; Malley-Duff, 734 F.2d at 140,

of the evidence. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175; McGlory, 968 F.2d at 333. The district court made no such finding here. It did 
not even address the issue, concluding, as a matter of law, that no conspiracy existed. Thus, the question whether there is 
sufficient evidence to permit such a finding is subject to plenary review. See McGlory 968 F.2d at 334. As will be made clear in the discussion that follows, the record is replete with circumstantial evidence that Licciardello, Standard, 
and Arzee were members of a conspiracy to boycott Rossi and drive him out of business. See infra § II.B.2.a. As the record also 
shows, Licciardello's threat was made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of it. We conclude therefore that Rossi has 
satisfied the preponderance standard with respect to all four requirements. "
1416,12," Standard and Arzee both raise questions about whether this conversation actually took place. In addition to denying it, they 
point out that Mulcahy did not hear the voice of the person on the phone, and only heard Licciardello talking to someone named 
""Cary."" Mulcahy assumed the person on the other end of the line was Cary Roth. As this is before us on a motion for summary 
judgment, we conclude that, in a light most favorable to Rossi, a jury could infer that ""Cary"" was Cary Roth of Arzee. "
1417,13," While offered in hearsay form, we will consider these statements because they are capable of being admissible at trial, see 
Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1234 n.9 (citations omitted), for Rossi has simply to produce the declarants to give the testimony. Id. "
1422,14," Bacchione appears to contradict himself during his deposition. For example, in reference to the decision whether to open up 
ABC as a distributor after Rossi Roofing had gone out of business, Bacchione also said: ""The concern was not whether or not to 
open up another distributor. The concern was whether or not we had adequate distribution, I think was the subject at hand. I 
think we felt there was adequate distribution. . . . There was not a valid reason to open up another distributor [next door to 
Standard]."" This contradictory testimony leads to two possible conclusions, and on summary judgment, we must accept the one 
most favorable to Rossi."
1422,15," For example, Krusa allegedly told Droesch in January 1989 that GAF would not sell to Rossi Florence in New Jersey because 
it had adequate distribution. In July 1989, when Krusa prevented Rossi from picking up an order of GAF product from HWI, 
Rossi spoke with Krusa who told him, ""The distribution is filled. GAF requires no other distributors."""
1422,16," Rossi contests the district court's affirmance of an order by the magistrate judge, denying his motion to compel GAF to 
disclose the names of the entity or entities that were the subject matter of certain conversations between GAF 's in-house 
counsel Robert Poyourow and Krusa on July 27, 1989, August 10, 1989, and January 6, 1990. Rossi hypothesizes that several 
of these discussions centered around HWI and Servistar, and he submits that the district court abused its discretion when it 
accepted GAF's description of the ""subject matter"" of these conversations on its privilege log as ""absence of a legal obligation to 
sell product."" We conclude, however, that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Rossi's motion to compel the "
1423,," name of the entity discussed or any other additional information concerning the ""subject matter"" of the conversation catalogued 
in GAF's privilege log. See Rabushka v. United States, 122 F.3d 559, 565 (8th Cir. 1997) (standard of review), cert. denied, 
Rabushka ex rel. United States v. Crane Co., 140 L. Ed. 2d 498, 118 S. Ct. 1336 (1998). Rule 26(b)(5) only requires that a 
party claiming a privilege ""describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed in a 
manner that . . . will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection."" Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 26(b)(5). 
These matters are generally best left to the district and magistrate courts' discretion. In the circumstances that exist here, we will 
not second guess the courts' conclusion that the description provided was adequate to support the privilege claim. "
1425,17," Cherbonneau told Rossi, ""GAF called, they knew where the product was going. They had filled their needs in that area, and [] 
they do not want us to ship to you."" "
1426,18," Sales of GAF product through Servistar, estimated at about $ 2.5 million, comprised only 12 of Servistar's total roofing 
purchases on behalf of its members and an insignificant fraction of Servistar's one billion plus national purchases in 1989. "
1427,19," On the one hand, the record indicates that Servistar refused Far Hills credit on August 15, 1989, even though Far Hills had 
only used $ 30,755 of its outstanding $ 75,000 credit limit and no payments were yet due. On the other hand, Servistar contends 
that it extended the $ 75,000 credit limit to Far Hills for the purpose of funding hardware purchases, not roofing supplies. 
According to Servistar's forceful rejoinder, the initial order of $ 30,755 was an error, and after it was discovered, Servistar 
unilaterally determined not to permit it to happen again. "
1428,20," As explained above, because Rossi's allegations qualify for per se treatment, the second and third prongs of the four-part 
antitrust prima facie case are conclusively presumed. See supra § II.A. "
1431,21," Defendants also complain that it is inappropriate to use sales figures Rossi achieved working for ABC, a major national chain, 
to estimate the revenues that Rossi Florence or Rossi Roofing would have achieved without the boycott. This position has some 
force and is certainly an appropriate argument to advance before the trier of fact; however, it is not uncontroverted. There is 
ample evidence in the record that wholesale roofing and siding sales has a strong local accent, and that after price, service and 
reliability are the next most critical factors in customers' purchasing decisions. Rossi had a long track record in northern New 
Jersey, and several witnesses testified that they would patronize Rossi regardless of whom he worked for, as long as he carried 
the product they needed at a competitive price, because he provided the best service. Thus, it is not clearly evident that Rossi's 
sales figures with ABC (or Standard) would necessarily be higher than with Rossi Roofing."
1431,22," For the guidance of the district court on remand, we note that the Rockhill Report satisfies the relaxed Bigelow standard of 
proof for estimating the amount of damages under which: the jury [may] conclude as a matter of just and reasonable inference from the proof of defendants' wrongful acts and their 
tendency to injure plaintiffs' business, and from the evidence of the decline in prices, profits and values, not shown to be 
attributable to other causes, that defendants' wrongful acts had caused damage to the plaintiffs. . . . [When] [] tortious acts . 
. . preclude[] ascertainment of the amount of damages more precisely, by comparison of profits, prices and values as 
affected by the conspiracy, with what they would have been in its absence under freely competitive conditions . . . we [have] 
held that the jury could return a verdict for the plaintiffs, even though damages could not be measured with the exactness 
which would otherwise have been possible. In such a case, even where the defendant by his own wrong has prevented a more precise computation, the jury may not 
render a verdict based on speculation or guesswork. But the jury may make a just and reasonable estimate of the damage 
based on relevant data, and render its verdict accordingly. In such circumstances 'juries are allowed to act on probable and 
inferential as well as [upon] direct and positive proof.' Any other rule would enable the wrongdoer to profit by his 
wrongdoing at the expense of his victim. It would be an inducement to make wrongdoing so effective and complete in every 
case as to preclude any recovery, by rendering the measure of damages uncertain. Bigelow, 327 U.S. at 264 (internal citations omitted). In Bigelow, the Supreme Court upheld a jury's damage award based upon a comparison of the plaintiff's actual profits with the 
contemporaneous profits of a competing theater with access to first-run films, which were illegally denied to plaintiff theater by a 
group of conspiring film distributors. See J. Truett Payne Co., Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 566, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442, 
101 S. Ct. 1923 (1981) (explaining Bigelow). The Bigelow plaintiff had also adduced evidence comparing his actual profits during 
the conspiracy with his profits when he had been able to obtain first-run films. See id. This was enough to uphold the jury's 
verdict. Similarly, in Zenith Radio, the Supreme Court permitted the plaintiff, who had been the victim of an illegal campaign 
against importers attempting to bring new products into Canada, to estimate its damages by comparing its market share in the 
United States (where it competed freely) with its market share in Canada (where it was the target of unlawful distribution-
disrupting tactics). See 395 U.S. at 116 n.11 & 124-25. Finally, we have held that ""plaintiffs must be free to select their own 
damage theories as long as they are supported by a reasonable foundation."" Danny Kresky, 716 F.2d at 213 (upholding a 
market share damage calculation approach in which the plaintiff argued that had it not been for the defendants' antitrust 
violations, it would have been able to achieve a percentage of the excluded market segment equal to the percentage of the 
market it enjoyed in the rest of the market generally). Compared with these cases, Rossi's damage estimation is far less speculative. The sales revenues (at least for the first few 
years of the ten year estimate) were exactly those that Rossi actually achieved while working as ABC's branch manager at the 
same location. Thus, the jury here need not even speculate whether the comparison market (or location) is similar enough to 
serve as a basis for its damage estimate, as the jury had to in Bigelow and Zenith Radio. Similarly, both the sales and expenses 
are based on real world numbers, not pure conjecture by an optimistic new competitor. These numbers may or may not "

mere speculation or wishful thinking, as was the case in Van Dyk Research and Southern Pacific. "

guidance for deciding the issues of duty and proximate cause, Prosser recognized the need to place some limit upon liability: There is still the problem of an end to liability, of a place to stop. It is still unthinkable that any one shall be liable to the end 
of time for all of the results that follow in endless sequence from his single act. Dean Prosser, Palsgraf Revisited at 24."
1450,11," Prosser, Law of Torts § 41, at 236 (4th ed. 1971). ""In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity,

child for his or her personal injuries, and a derivative action in favor of the parents for loss of services and medical expenses.)."
1450,13," The Supreme Court of Ohio recognized a minor child's cause of action for loss of parental consortium against one who has 
negligently harmed the child's parent in Gallimore v. Children's Hospital Med. Ctr., 67 Ohio St. 3d 244, 617 N.E.2d 1052 (1993) 
(syllabus at paragraph two). "
1451,14," The Ohio Supreme Court generally defines proximate cause consistent with Cardozo's majority opinion in Palsgraf. The Ohio 
Supreme Court, in Piqua v. Morris, 98 Ohio St. 42, 120 N.E. 300 (1918), defined proximate cause in paragraph one of the 
syllabus: HN5[
] The 'proximate cause' of a result is that which in a natural and continued sequence contributes to produce the 
result, without which it would not have happened. The fact that some other cause concurred with the negligence of a 
defendant in producing an injury does not relieve him from liability, unless it is shown such other cause would have 
produced the injury independently of defendant's negligence. In Armour & Co. v. Ott, 117 Ohio St. 252, 257, 158 N.E. 189 (1927), the Ohio Supreme Court approved the following definition 
for remote cause: "" . . . an injury that could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable result of an act of 
negligence . . . ."" No liability can result to a party, ""even if negligence of a party is a cause of injury to another,"" if the cause is a remote one.  Tanzi

1451,15, The parties here identify no clearly controlling precedent of the Sixth Circuit.
1451,16," In making the claim that plaintiffs' claims are too remote to allow the action to proceed, defendants offensively misrepresent 
the Holmes holding to the Court. Thus, defendants represent to this Court: ""[In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 
[the Supreme Court] held that a RICO plaintiff who ""complain[s] of harm flowing merely from the misfortune, visited upon a third 
person by the defendant's acts . . . stand[s] at too remote a distance to recover."" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268-69. The complete quote from Holmes is: ""Thus, a plaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon 
a third person by the defendant's acts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover."" See, e.g., 1 J. 
Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56 (1882). "
1452,," Defendants' misrepresentation is obvious. First, the quoted language describes general language from a treatise without clearly 
adopting the treatise. The Supreme Court does not clearly adopt the description in the treatise. Second and more important, the 
defendants remove the term ""generally"" in an effort to cause this Court to misunderstand the Holmes holding."

Thomas Jefferson spoke to change in the law: I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with 
the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new 
truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to 
keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat that fitted him when a boy as civilized 
society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors. Quoted in Klever v. Canton Sachsenheim, Inc., 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 3992, No. 1998-CA-0010 (Ohio Ct. App. 5th Dist. August 
10, 1998) (Gwin, W.S.) (unreported)."
1452,19," Defendants deny that their acts or omissions caused any damage. In reviewing defendants' motion for judgment, plaintiffs' 
allegations that defendants' acts caused damages are taken as true. "
1453,20," In Burckhardt, the Supreme Court of Ohio explained its approach: That the person injured shall received [sic] a compensation commensurate with his loss or injury, is the universal and

damages are tested and corrected."

construed to effectuate its remedial purposes."" Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 27, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17, 104 S. Ct. 296 
(1983). The Sixth Circuit also recognizes ""the broad construction of RICO."" Dana Corp. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield Mutual of 
Northern Ohio, 900 F.2d 882, 887 (6th Cir. 1990). RICO is written ""in terms variously described as 'broad' . . . 'expansive' . . . 
and 'sweeping'."" County of Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 847 (6th Cir. 1989) (quoting Associated General, 459 
U.S. at 529, McCready, 457 U.S. at 472, and Southhaven, 715 F.2d 1079 at 1081). "
1458,35," Plaintiffs claim that they were directly injured by defendants conduct. Having determined that plaintiffs have standing under the 
Ohio Corrupt Activity Act even if they were not directly injured, the Court need not reach this issue with regard to Counts XIV, 
XV, and XVI of the Amended Complaint."
1458,36," In Holmes, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff, Securities and Investor Protection Corporation (""SIPC""), had not met the 
proximate cause requirement and thus had no standing to bring suit under RICO. SIPC is a private nonprofit corporation, created 
pursuant to the Securities Investors Act, which most broker-dealers are required by law to join and which has a statutory duty to 
advance funds to reimburse the customers of member broker-dealers that are unable to meet their obligations.  503 U.S. at 261. SIPC brought a civil RICO action alleging that former members of a brokerage firm conspired in a stock manipulation scheme. 
SIPC said this scheme caused damages of nearly $ 13 million representing monies that SIPC advanced to cover claims. See 
also Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494 (3rd Cir. 1998). "
1459,37," Defendants suggest support from Firestone v. Galbreath, 976 F.2d 279 (6th Cir. 1992). The case is inapposite. In Firestone, 
beneficiaries of a trust complained that the trust corpus was reduced by theft during another beneficiary's life. The Sixth Circuit 
found that the decedent's estate had standing to bring an action but the children as beneficiaries did not. Important to this 
determination, the Sixth Circuit found that under Ohio law the executor, not the heirs, have the right to bring the estate's causes 
of action. Ohio does not permit heirs to bring these claims for their own, individual, benefit.  976 F.2d at 283. The Sixth Circuit 
further found that any property was removed before death. Ohio law grants no enforceable rights to potential takers under a will 
before the testator's death. The Firestone plaintiffs had no vested interests until death.  976 F.2d at 284-285."
1459,38," The Fourth Circuit explained its finding: LDS and Rice contend that their customers were the only victims of the alleged fraud and only those customers can assert 
their rights. They further maintain that any injury to Mid Atlantic stemmed from the independent intervening acts of Mid 
Atlantic customers after LDS's solicitations. It follows, the appellees argue, that the solicitations could not have been the 
proximate cause of Mid Atlantic's injuries. We are unable to agree. In Brandenburg, 859 F.2d 1179 at 1189, it was recognized that ""the legal cause determination is 
properly one of law for the court, taking into consideration such factors as the foreseeability of the particular injury, the 
intervention of other independent causes, and the factual directness of the causal connection."" Brandenburg also explained 
that proximate causation requires a nexus between the proscribed acts and the injuries.  Id. at 1187. We did not, however, 
intend to establish a rule that only injuries suffered by the immediate victim of a predicate act satisfied the ""by reason of"" 
requirement of § 1964(c). Mid Atlantic, 18 F.3d at 263. "
1460,39," The ""injury to business or property"" language in 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) was taken from Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
15. The United States Supreme Court has held that this language has ""restrictive significance"" in that ""it would, for example, 
'exclude personal injuries suffered.'"" Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979). Case 
law interpreting the Clayton Act has been persuasive and heavily relied upon by courts addressing issues involving RICO. See 
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 267-68, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311 (1992)."
1460,40," The Sixth Circuit has held that economic losses resulting from physical injuries are not damages to ""business or property"" 
within the meaning of RICO: Whether [the plaintiff] can show a financial loss does not, by definition, establish that she has suffered a business or 
property injury within the meaning of § 1964(c). Most personal injuries -- loss of earnings, loss of consortium, loss of 
guidance, mental anguish, and pain and suffering, to name a few -- will entail pecuniary consequences. Perhaps the 
economic aspects of such injuries could, as a theoretical matter, be viewed as injuries to ""business or property"" but 
engaging in such metaphysical speculation is a task best left to philosophers, not the federal judiciary. Doe v. Roe, 958 F.2d 763, 770 (7th Cir. 1992). "
1461,41," Count IV is based on a violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. Count X is based on claimed violations of the 
Valentine Act, Ohio Rev. Code § 1331, et seq. "
1463,42, Amended Complaint at P 300.
1463,43," In Count VI, plaintiffs allege an intentional breach of a voluntarily undertaken duty. In Count VII, plaintiffs allege a negligent 
breach of a voluntarily undertaken duty. "
1464,44," Defendants publicly disseminated the ""Frank Statement,"" which appeared in 448 newspapers across the nation in 258 cities. 
According to Defendants, this was done because ""people are entitled to know where we stand on this matter and what we intend 
to do about it."" Amended Complaint at P 105. "
1465,45," Plaintiffs also cite to authority from other jurisdictions to support their claim that physical injury is not required. See, e.g., City 
and County of San Francisco v. Philip Morris, Inc., 957 F. Supp. 1130, 1142-43 (N.D. Cal. 1997); State, by Humphrey v. Philip 
Morris Inc., 551 N.W.2d 490 (Minn. 1996). The Court finds the discussion of voluntarily assumed duty fails to directly speak to 
whether a showing of physical harm is required. But more importantly, clear Ohio authority teaches that physical harm is an 
element of a claim for breach of a voluntarily assumed duty. "
1470,1," The land was zoned M-1. Dkt. no. 51, Exh. 15. A hotel may be lawfully be constructed in such a district. See id., Exh. 11, Art. 5, 
§§ 8.2(7), 5.2(10). "
1472,2," Defendant K&M Properties of Somerset, Inc., which operates the local Days Inn, has additionally moved for summary judgment 
on the ground that it successfully withdrew from any unlawful conspiracy and should not be held liable. Dkt. nos. 40, 41. 
Because I conclude that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides a complete defense to the allegations of the complaint, I need 
not reach this issue. "
1473,3," The state law standard for determining whether a land use appeal is frivolous is similar to the one applied under a Noerr-
Pennington analysis: A frivolous appeal is one in which no justiciable question has been presented and the appeal is readily recognizable as 
devoid of merit in that there is little prospect that it can ever succeed. Abbey v. Zoning Hearing Bd., 126 Pa. Commw. 235, 559 A.2d 107, 112 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1989) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 
601 (5th ed. 1979))."
1473,4," Defendants rely upon the ""expert opinion"" of Attorney David W. Craig, retired President Judge of the Commonwealth Court of 
Pennsylvania, to support their argument that their land use appeals were ""not objectively baseless as a matter of law. . . ."" Dkt. 
no. 45, at 19. It detracts not at all from my high regard for former Judge Craig, nor the esteem in which he is held by the legal 
community, to observe that lack of objective baselessness is not the sort of issue that lends itself to expert testimony under Fed. 
R. Evid. 702 and 704. While ""testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because 
it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact[,]"" id., ""an expert may not state his or her opinion as to legal 
standards nor may he or she state legal conclusions drawn by applying the law to the facts."" Okland Oil Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 144 
F.3d 1308, 1328 (10th Cir. 1998); accord Burger v. Mays, 176 F.R.D. 153, 156-57 (E.D. Pa. 1997); Haberern v. Kaupp Vascular 
Surgeons Ltd., 812 F. Supp. 1376, 1378 (E.D. Pa. 1992); Rich v. Bailey, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19437, No. 95-9632, 1996 WL 
745298, *5 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 23, 1996) (citing cases), aff'd mem., 135 F.3d 766 (3d Cir. 1997). ""Because the jury does not decide . 
. . questions of law, such testimony is not helpful to the jury and so does not fall within the literal terms of Fed. R. Evid. 702. . . . 
This is because the judge's expert knowledge of the law makes any such assistance at best cumulative, and at worst 
prejudicial."" Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 1997). Indeed, ""each courtroom comes equipped with a 
'legal expert,' called a judge, and it is his or her province alone to instruct the jury on the relevant legal standards."" Burkhart v. 
Washington Metro Area Transit Auth., 324 U.S. App. D.C. 241, 112 F.3d 1207, 1213 (D.C. Cir. 1997); accord Askanase v. Fatjo, 
130 F.3d 657, 673 (5th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, because such testimony would not assist the jury to determine a fact in issue, I 
cannot consider it as factual evidence on a motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, I will treat Attorney Craig's report as 
additional legal argument, which it plainly is, and to which plaintiffs have had ample opportunity to respond. "
1475,5," Because of this disposition, it is unnecessary for me to consider plaintiffs' argument, dkt. no. 50, at 43-47, that their antitrust 
claims survive summary judgments on their merits."
1475,6," This holds especially true for malicious prosecution claims asserted against zoning objectors, where it is important not to chill 
the First Amendment Rights of neighbors to come forward and make their positions known. See Matter of Larsen, 532 Pa. 326, 
616 A.2d 529, 592 (Pa. 1992)."
1475,7," The Brownsville case did not involve a claim for abuse of process (as opposed to wrongful use of civil process); nevertheless, 
that court did cite with approval a Colorado case applying the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to that tort.  839 F.2d at 160 (citing 
Protect Our Mountain Envt., Inc. v. District Court, 677 P.2d 1361, 1369 (Colo. 1984)). Plaintiffs have not argued any principled "
1476,," reason why abuse of process should be treated any differently under a Noerr-Pennington analysis than wrongful use of civil 
process, and I can discern no such difference. Hence, I will dismiss this claim as well. "
