26,1," Defendant USGI requested oral argument, but plaintiff CISSI indicated that it was unnecessary. The Court agrees in view of the 
extensive briefing and the excellent presentation of evidence by both parties. "
28,2," Plaintiff's claim also asserts violation of RCW 19.86.040, which essentially follows section 2 of the Sherman Act. The parties 
rely almost exclusively on federal cases."
28,3," Leveraging (use of market power in one market to gain advantage in another market) may violate antitrust law. Key 
Enterprises of Delaware, Inc. v. Venice Hospital., 919 F.2d 1550 (11th Cir. 1990), vacated, 979 F.2d 806 (11th Cir. 1992); but 
see Catlin v. Washington Energy Co., 791 F.2d 1343, 1346 (9th Cir. 1986) (reserving judgment' on the issue of monopoly 
leveraging as separate antitrust claim). "
30,4," Washington law recognizes that this statute is patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the Legislature ""anticipated 
our courts would be guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the corresponding federal statutes. RCW 
19.86.920."" Ballo v. James S. Black Co., 39 Wash. App. 21, 692 P.2d 182 (1984)."
30,5," In Jefferson Parish, the Court's analysis was premised on section 1 of the Sherman Act. It is well to remember that in the 
instant case, the Court is examining an attempted exclusive dealing as it relates to Washington law. In doing so, it is relying on 
federal cases relying on federal antitrust law, but an attempt at exclusive dealing would probably fall under section 2 of the 
Sherman Act dealing with attempted monopolization, rather than section 1 (contracts, combinations and conspiracies). "
31,6," The Kodak case, supra, was analyzed generally under section 1 (prohibition against contracts, combinations and conspiracies) 
and unlike this case involved a clear requirement that purchasers of Kodak duplicating machines, purchase Kodak services. 
Moreover, Kodak had prevented the supply of parts to non-Kodak service agencies. Thus there was an obvious tying 
arrangement. The issue remanded on the district court's grant of summary judgment, however, was whether or not the tying was 
illegal -- that is, that it was not justified by business reasons."
31,7," Most of the cases refer to ""per se"" illegal tying arrangement, but not all tying arrangements are declared illegal. In her 
concurring opinion in Jefferson, supra, Justice O'Connor explained the history of this apparent anomaly and argued for 
abandoning the per se label: Some of our earlier cases did indeed declare that tying arrangements serve ""hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of 
competition."" Standard Oil Company v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 305-306, 93 L. Ed. 1371, 69 S. Ct. 1051 (1949) 
(dictum). However, this declaration was not taken literally even by the cases that purported to rely upon it. In practice, a tie 
has been illegal only if the seller is shown to have ""sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to 
appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product . . ."" Northern Pacific RR. Co., 356 U.S. at 6."

42,1," In evaluating the merits of these motions, this court also considered the papers submitted by the Hospital Association of the 
State of New York, the New York State Society of Anesthesiologists and the Medical Society of the State of New York, which 
were granted permission to file amicus curiae briefs in this action."
42,2," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, provides, in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. "
44,3," With respect to this second element, there are several factors which a court may consider. These factors include: 1) the 
potential for duplicative recovery; 2) the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violation; 3) the directness of the 
injury; 4) whether the claim for damages rests on some abstract conception or speculative measure of harm; 5) the nature of the 
plaintiff as a consumer or a competitor in the relevant market; and 6) the causal connection between the asserted antitrust 
violation and the harm to the plaintiff. Associated Gen'l Contractors of Calif., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 
U.S. at 537-45, 103 S. Ct. at 908-12, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723; see also Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110, 111 n.6,

Roofing Corp. v. Tremco, Inc., 753 F.2d 242, 247 (2d Cir. 1985). "
45,4," The court notes that Balaklaw's allegations regarding the ""sham"" nature of the due process hearing that was conducted prior to 
his ouster appear to the court to be more appropriate in the context of a breach of contract or intentional interference with 
contractual relations action, rather than an antitrust claim. See, e.g., Chuz v. St. Vincent's Hosp. & Medical Ctr., 186 A.D.2d 
450, 589 N.Y.S.2d 17 (1st Dep't 1992); Saha v. Record, 177 A.D.2d 763, 575 N.Y.S.2d 986, 988 (3d Dep't 1991); Giannelli v. 
St. Vincent's Hosp. & Medical Ctr., 160 A.D.2d 227, 553 N.Y.S.2d 677 (1st Dep't 1990). "
46,5," See generally amended complaint, PP 21-39. "
48,6," The letter of December 5, 1991 which was jointly signed by Mr. Lovell as Hospital President and Mr. Wesley D. Stisser as 
Chairman of the Board of Trustees and addressed to the members of the Medical Staff, provided, in part, as follows: The Board of Trustees, in a specially held meeting on December 3, 1991, approved a resolution that directs the President 
of the Hospital to elicit proposals from anesthesiologists, both in our community and in a much broader geographic area. 
The intent of the Board of Trustees is to contract exclusively with one group to provide all anesthesia services at our 
Hospital. . . . After the group awarded the exclusive contract is in place, any other anesthesiologists now having privileges at the Hospital 
will be unable to utilize those privileges to provide anesthesia care at Cortland Memorial. . . . See Exhibit F of the Seymour Declaration. "
57,1," Also known as the Automobile Franchise Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1225. For convenience, this Act will be referred to hereinafter 
as the ""Dealers' Act""."
57,2," New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 460 et seq., referred to hereinafter as the ""New York Franchise Act"". "
61,3," This market is District 42 of GM's New York Marketing Center, which comprises a number of upstate New York and 
Pennsylvania counties. See Sergo Affid., exh. G. "
63,6, The court also noted that the Brigadier line accounted for over 70% of GM's heavy duty truck sales in 1987. 
64,7," The Schule affidavit is attached to plaintiff's Notice of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on plaintiff's Robinson-Patman Act 
claims, dated May 11, 1990, and has been incorporated by plaintiff in opposition to the present motion (P. Memo., p. 12). The 
Modaffari affidavit is referenced in plaintiff's opposition papers (P. Memo., p. 34). Defendants argue that plaintiff has failed to produce evidence sufficient to rebut GM's evidence suggesting that in 1986, the last 
full year that plaintiff purchased trucks listed in the heavy duty addendum, heavy duty truck sales contributed less than 2% of 
plaintiff's gross sales, and approximately 2% of plaintiff's  [*28] gross income (GM Reply, p. 20, Wiswall December 1987 Affid., 
exh.; Consolidated Affid., exh's. C & D). These same documents indicate that from January through October of 1987 heavy duty 
truck sales contributed less than 3% of plaintiff's gross sales, and approximately 2% of plaintiff's gross income. However, neither 
the documents nor the figures upon which defendants rely indicate the profit attributable to parts, or to warranty and non-
warranty repairs performed by plaintiff on GM heavy duty trucks. Modaffari's affidavit does address income derived from 
warranty and other service on heavy duty trucks. Furthermore, there is some evidence that a low sales volume in the heavy duty 
truck line in late 1986 and 1987 may have been attributable to GM's failure to provide plaintiff with competitive equalization 
(""CE"") during this period (Schule April 1990 Affid., ¶ 21). Therefore, the figures contained in Schule's and Modaffari's affidavits 
regarding the 49% and 59% figures are sufficient to create a material issue of fact for trial."
64,8," See Glick at 498, where the Second Circuit noted, ""Moreover, GM has not withdrawn completely from the heavy-duty truck 
business. It continues to manufacture the Brigadier, a successful product so far as appears on the state of this record. Indeed, it 
is more than just a share-holder in the joint venture with Volvo."" "
66,9," For a full discussion of the impact of the Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause on New Jersey's franchise act (which is 
similar to the New York Franchise Act in relevant respects), see General Motors Corp. v. Gallo GMC Truck Sales, 711 F.Supp. 
810, 819-21 (D.N.J. 1989); Freedman Truck Center v. GMC, 784 F.Supp. 167, 174-75 (D.N.J. 1992)(agreeing with Gallo 
decision finding no preemption of New Jersey franchise act by federal Dealers' Act)."
66,10," See also, Complaint, p. 9, where plaintiff alleges, ""Defendant  [*39] GMC terminated Schule's class 8 truck franchise effective 
December 31, 1987 stating that same would 'expire' on that date even though same by its express terms did not expire until 
October 31, 1990"" (emphasis added). Thus plaintiff recognized that the letter terminated the alleged franchise, yet failed to bring 
this action within 120 days. "
67,11," The portions of the Schule deposition referenced in this section have been submitted by GM together with its motion papers 
(GM Memo., exh. F). "
69,12," Sections 197 and 197-a were repealed as of April 24, 1988; however, these provisions remain effective as to actions filed 
before repeal.  [*47] N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law § 94. Defendants agree that these statutes apply to the present action (see, e.g., 
GM Memo., p. 39 n. 28). "
71,13," Plaintiff writes that the abbreviation ""VTC"" in the Stock Purchase Agreement refers to White (Plaintiff's Memorandum, p. 9). On 
the contrary, as White indicates in its Memorandum (White Memo., p. 3 n. 2), it is clear from the Stock Purchase Agreement that 
""VTC"" refers to Volvo Lastragner  [*56] AB, a/k/a/ Volvo Truck Corporation, a Swedish corporation (See Stock Purchase 
Agreement, p. 4). "
73,14," Rea v. Ford Motor Co., 497 F.2d 577 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 868, 95 S. Ct. 126, 42 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1974), relied upon 
by plaintiff, does not change this result. Rea indicates that a manufacturer's threat to injure the dealer if the dealer  [*64] does 
not give up another franchise may be actionable. Nonetheless, there must be a threat to interfere with a right already possessed 
by the dealer; a threat to withhold rights that the dealer merely expects to be awarded is not the type of coercion targeted by the 
Act. "
74,15," ""Horizontal"" restraints are ""agreements between competitors at the same level of the market structure, and 'vertical' restraints 
[are] . . . combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, such as manufacturers and distributors."" Oreck 
Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 131 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S.Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1978). "
76,16," Although market share is not the only indicant of anticompetitive impact, a low market share may suggest little market power 
and, therefore, no unreasonable restrain on trade. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 112 
S. Ct. 2072, 2081, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992); Reazin v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., 899 F.2d 951, 964-72 (10th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1005 110 S. Ct. 3241, 111 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1990)."
76,17," Here, plaintiff claims that the relevant market is Buffalo, New York, whereas it maintains elsewhere that the relevant market is 
all of Western New York, or the entire United States. "
81,18," See, supra, this Court's discussion of Diehl & Sons, Inc. v. International Harvester Co., 426 F.Supp. 110 (E.D.N.Y. 1976) in 
connection with plaintiff's claim of a conspiracy to restrain trade, under § 1 of the Sherman Act. Diehl demonstrates that plaintiff's 
allegations of injury to itself are insufficient to establish anticompetitive effect or injury. Furthermore,  [*92] defendants have 
introduced evidence that no such effect resulted, because heavy duty automobiles are interchangeable, and because plaintiff 
maintained its Mercedes-Benz franchise and continued to operate under the GM light and medium duty addenda. This evidence 
further indicates that plaintiff has failed to introduce sufficient proof of antitrust injury. "
83,19," Although leave to re-plead should be freely granted in cases such as this, Richardson Greenshields Sec., Inc. v. Lau, 825 F.2d 
647, 653 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1987); Luce v. Edelstein, 802 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir. 1986), leave to re-plead will not be granted in this case 
because of the other infirmities of plaintiff's RICO claim. "
87,20," In fact, plaintiff offers even less support for its claim of personal jurisdiction over the defendants than it  [*115] did in 
connection with that earlier decision. Judge Elfvin's decision refers to an affidavit of Nelson Schule indicating that the individual 
defendants made personal visits to plaintiff in New York and conducted written and telephonic communications with it, in 
connection with GM's decision to terminate its ""franchise"" and the subsequent decision by VGM to award its new franchise to 
Buffalo Truck. This Court is referred to no similar documentation in plaintiff's responsive papers. "
104,*," Solicitor General Starr, Acting Assistant Attorney General James, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Michael R. Dreeben, 
Catherine G. O'Sullivan, and James M. Spears filed a brief for the United States as amicus curiae urging affirmance. "
105,1," HN3[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""every contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 punishes ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among 
the several States."""
105,2," The Court of Appeals held that Columbia's alleged refusal to grant copyright licenses was not ""separate and distinct"" from the 
prosecution of its infringement suit.  944 F.2d at 1528. The court also held that PRE had failed to establish how it could have 
suffered antitrust injury from Columbia's other allegedly anticompetitive acts.  Id., at 1529. Thus, whatever antitrust injury 
Columbia inflicted must have stemmed from the attempted enforcement of copyrights, and we do not consider whether Columbia 
could have made a valid claim of immunity for anticompetitive conduct independent of petitioning activity. Cf.  Continental Ore 
Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 707-708, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962). "
106,3," Several Courts of Appeals demand that an alleged sham be proved legally unreasonable. See McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 
958 F.2d 1552, 1560, and n.12 (CA11 1992); Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 700 F.2d 785, 809-
812 (CA2 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1073, 79 L. Ed. 2d 220, 104 S. Ct. 984 (1984); Hydro-Tech Corp. v. Sundstrand Corp., 
673 F.2d 1171, 1177 (CA10 1982); Federal Prescription Service, Inc. v. American Pharmaceutical Assn., 214 U.S. App. D.C. 76, 
85, 89, 663 F.2d 253, 262, 266 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 928, 71 L. Ed. 2d 472, 102 S. Ct. 1293 (1982). Still other courts 
have held that successful litigation by definition cannot be sham. See, e.g., Eden Hannon & Co. v. Sumitomo Trust & Banking 
Co., 914 F.2d 556, 564-565 (CA4 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 947, 113 L. Ed. 2d 467, 111 S. Ct. 1414 (1991); South Dakota v. 
Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc., 880 F.2d 40, 54 (CA8 1989), cert. denied sub nom.  South Dakota v. Kansas City 
Southern R. Co., 493 U.S. 1023, 107 L. Ed. 2d 745, 110 S. Ct. 726 (1990); Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, 
Inc., 749 F.2d 154, 161 (CA3 1984). Other Courts of Appeals would regard some meritorious litigation as sham. The Sixth Circuit treats ""genuine [legal] substance"" 
as raising merely ""a rebuttable presumption"" of immunity. Westmac, Inc. v. Smith, 797 F.2d 313, 318 (1986) (emphasis added), 
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1035, 93 L. Ed. 2d 838, 107 S. Ct. 885 (1987). The Seventh Circuit denies immunity for the pursuit of 
valid claims if ""the stakes, discounted by the probability of winning, would be too low to repay the investment in litigation."" Grip-
Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 472 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1317, 103 S. Ct. 2430 
(1983). Finally, in the Fifth Circuit, ""success on the merits does not . . . preclude"" proof of a sham if the litigation was not 
""significantly motivated by a genuine desire for judicial relief."" In re Burlington Northern, Inc., 822 F.2d 518, 528 (1987), cert. 
denied sub nom.  Union Pacific R. Co. v. Energy Transportation Systems, Inc., 484 U.S. 1007, 98 L. Ed. 2d 652, 108 S. Ct. 
701 (1988). "
107,4," California Motor Transport did refer to the antitrust defendants' ""purpose to deprive . . . competitors of meaningful access to the 
. . . courts."" 404 U.S. at 512. See also id., at 515 (noting a ""purpose to eliminate . . . a competitor by denying him free and 
meaningful access to the agencies and courts""); id., at 518 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment) (agreeing that the antitrust laws 
could punish acts intended ""to discourage and ultimately to prevent [a competitor] from invoking"" administrative and judicial 
process). HN8[
] That a sham depends on the existence of anticompetitive intent, however, does not transform the sham 
inquiry into a purely subjective investigation. "
108,5," HN14[
] A winning lawsuit is by definition a reasonable effort at petitioning for redress and therefore not a sham. On the other 
hand, when the antitrust defendant has lost the underlying litigation, a court must ""resist the understandable temptation to 
engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding"" that an ultimately unsuccessful ""action must have been unreasonable or without 
foundation."" Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421-422, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648, 98 S. Ct. 694 (1978). Accord, "
109,," Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14-15, 66 L. Ed. 2d 163, 101 S. Ct. 173 (1980) (per curiam). The court must remember that ""even 
when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for 
bringing suit."" Christiansburg, supra, at 422."
109,6," In surveying the ""forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes and 
which may result in antitrust violations,"" we have noted that ""unethical conduct in the setting of the adjudicatory process often 
results in sanctions"" and that ""misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the 
adjudicatory process."" California Motor Transport, 404 U.S. at 512-513. We need not decide here whether and, if so, to what 
extent Noerr permits the imposition of antitrust liability for a litigant's fraud or other misrepresentations. Cf.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 
60(b)(3) (allowing a federal court to ""relieve a party . . . from a final judgment"" for ""fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or other 
misconduct of an adverse party""); Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 176-177, 
15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965); id., at 179-180 (Harlan, J., concurring)."
109,7," This tort is frequently called ""malicious prosecution,"" which (strictly speaking) governs the malicious pursuit of criminal 
proceedings without probable cause. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 120, p. 
892 (5th ed. 1984). The threshold for showing probable cause is no higher in the civil context than in the criminal. See 
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 674, Comment e, pp. 454-455 (1977). "
112,1," Ante, at 60. See also ante, at 62: ""Sham litigation must constitute the pursuit of claims so baseless that no reasonable litigant 
could realistically expect to secure favorable relief""; ante, at 60: ""If an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably 
calculated to elicit a favorable outcome, the suit is immunized under Noerr . . . ."" But see ante, at 62: ""The existence of probable 
cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation."" And see 
ante, at 65: ""Columbia's copyright action was arguably 'warranted by existing law'"" under the standards of Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 11. These varied restatements of the Court's new test make it unclear whether it is willing to affirm the Court of 
Appeals by any of these standards individually, or by all of them together."
112,2," The Court's recent decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494, 113 S. Ct. 566 (1992) makes me wonder 
whether ""10 years of litigation and two trips to the Court of Appeals"" to recover ""one dollar from one defendant,"" id., at 116 
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring), would qualify as a reasonable expectation of ""favorable relief"" under today's opinion. "

claims had become objectively unreasonable supported a jury's sham finding. AT&T's anticompetitive actions were in fact so far 
removed from the act of petitioning the government for relief that Chief Judge Oakes and Judge Meskill also held, in reliance on 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962), and Cantor v. 
Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976) (plurality opinion), that tariff filings with the Federal 
Communications Commission were acts of private commercial activity in the marketplace rather than requests for governmental 
action, and thus were not even arguably protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  Litton Systems, 700 F.2d at 806-809."

Although the Sixth Circuit did hold that the genuine substance of an anticompetitive lawsuit creates a rebuttable presumption of 
objective reasonableness, given the facts of that case -- in which the antitrust plaintiff had presented strong evidence that the 
defendants' lawsuit, which followed a long and unsuccessful lobbying effort, had been motivated solely for the anticompetitive 
harm the judicial process would inflict on it -- that modest reservation was probably wise. Evidence of anticompetitive animus in 
Westmac was in fact so great that Chief Judge Merritt thought that the plaintiff had successfully rebutted the presumptive 
reasonableness of defendants' lawsuit. The delay from the defendants' combined lobbying and litigation attack had allegedly 
sent the plaintiff into bankruptcy, and memos from one defendant to its attorney had stated, ""'If this [lobbying activity] doesn't 
succeed, start a lawsuit -- bonds won't sell,'"" 797 F.2d at 318, and (in a statement repeated to a codefendant), ""'if nothing else, "
114,," we'll delay sale of the bonds,'"" id., at 322 (Merritt, C. J., dissenting) (emphasis omitted). In any event, the Sixth Circuit rule -- to 
the extent that it would apply in a case as simple as this one -- would result in the same conclusion we reach here."

denied, 455 U.S. 928, 71 L. Ed. 2d 472, 102 S. Ct. 1293 (1982). In that case, the antitrust plaintiff alleged a 2-decade long 
conspiracy to lobby, boycott, and sue it (in state licensing boards, state legislatures, the marketplace, and both state and federal 
courts) out of existence. In spite of those allegations, the Court of Appeals found that the defendant's actions, which primarily 
consisted in lobbying for the abolition of plaintiff's mail-order prescription business, were immune under Noerr-Pennington."
114,8," In Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466 (1982) (Posner, J.), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1317, 
103 S. Ct. 2430 (1983), the antitrust defendant's alleged violations of several provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts 
included much more than the filing of a single lawsuit; they encompassed a broad scheme of monopolizing the entire relevant 
market by: purchasing patents; threatening to file many other, patently groundless lawsuits; acquiring a competitor; dividing 
markets; and filing a fraudulent patent application. In In re Burlington Northern, Inc., 822 F.2d 518 (CA5 1987), cert. denied, 484 
U.S. 1007 (1988), the plaintiffs alleged, and produced evidence to support their theory, that the defendant had filed suit solely to 
cause them a delay of crippling expense, and the defendants had either brought or unsuccessfully defended a succession of 
related lawsuits involving plaintiff's right to compete. In both of these cases the Courts of Appeals ably attempted to balance 
strict enforcement of the antitrust laws with possible abuses of the judicial process. That they permitted some reliance on 
subjective motivation -- as even we have done in cases alleging abuse of judicial process, see California Motor Transport Co. v. 
Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 513-518, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972) -- is neither surprising nor relevant in a case 
involving no such allegations. "

145,1," The motions were: (a) a ""Cross Motion to Compel Answers to Caribe's Discovery Requests"" and Opposition to BMW NA's 
Rule 26(c) motion (Docket No. 14); (b) a motion for leave to file a ""Second Amended Complaint"" (in direct response to BMW 
NA's Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment) (Docket No. 15); (c) a tendered ""Second Amended Complaint"" (Docket 
No. 15); (d) a Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion to deny BMW NA's dispositive motion or to ""continue a hearing on the motion until 
discovery has been conducted"" (Docket No. 18) with an affidavit from William R. Pakalka, one of Caribe's attorneys; and (e) a 
motion obliquely entitled ""Caribe BMW, Inc.'s Memorandum of Law in Preliminary Opposition to Motion by Defendant BMW of 
North America, Inc. to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment"" (Docket No. 17). Though the title of this last motion is confusing, the 
motion was clearly an opposition to BMW NA's motion for summary judgment since it included a separate ""Statement of Material 
Facts as to Which There Exists a Genuine Issue to be Tried,"" as well as an affidavits from Juan Antonio Quintano Heilpern, 
President and principal stockholder of Caribe."
145,2," BMW AG's mistiming of its Motion for Summary Judgment, as opposed to its Motion to Dismiss included in the same 
document, has little practical effect regarding plaintiff's contract claims, since the only allegations that plaintiff had amended dealt 
exclusively with antitrust law. Regardless, BMW AG later slightly revised its original Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary 
Judgment and refiled it to correspond to the Second Amended Complaint (Docket No. 37, August 1, 1991)."
145,3," Our impression is apparently shared by Caribe who in its most recent motion conceded that ""BMW NA thus currently has 
pending before this Court only a motion to dismiss."" Docket No. 50, at 2. We will proceed to consider only the allegations of the 
complaint for purposes of the requested dismissal of the antitrust claims. "
146,4, Plaintiff's Rule 56(f) motion was completely silent as to BMW AG's motion to dismiss the contract claims.
146,5," Although, as stated above, the Court will limit its review of the defendants' motions to dismiss the antitrust claims strictly to the 
well-pleaded facts in the Complaint, no such limitation applies to our review of BMW AG's motion to dismiss the contract claims. 
Regarding these claims, we have reviewed the affidavits of Mr. Dilhmann and Dr. Schmitt, as well as a statement of 
uncontroverted facts submitted by BMW AG which, on the specific issue of the effect of the forum-selection clause, was not 
controverted by plaintiff. In fact, plaintiff focused its evidence and discovery requests on the antitrust and personal jurisdiction 
issues and never attempted to show that the clause was unreasonable or that Germany was a fundamentally unfair forum. Since 
plaintiff has the burden of proof on this issue, and given that BMW AG's motion was presented as one to dismiss the complaint 
and/or for summary judgment, then BMW AG's statement of facts and affidavits must be taken as true. See Alvarado Morales v. 
Digital Equip. Corp., 843 F.2d 613, 615 (1st Cir. 1988) and HN2[

Supp. 791, 845 (D. Minn. 1989)."
149,8," This lumping together of the defendants is so indiscriminate and confusing as to constitute an attempt to make BMW AG and 
BMW NA look like a single entity by the simple fiat of referring to them collectively or separately to suit plaintiff's purposes. For 
example, in paragraph 11 of the Complaint, plaintiff refers to ""BMW"" as the manufacturer of BMW products, where clearly BMW 
NA, as opposed to BMW AG, is not a manufacturer of anything. "
152,9," The Supreme Court has consistently recognized that HN12[
] lost profits, without more, is not antitrust injury. USA Petroleum, 110 S. Ct. at 1890-91; Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 109-10, 116, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. 
Ct. 484 (1986); Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 488. In any event, the assertions underpinning Caribe's maximum resale price 
maintenance claim are inconsistent with the facts allegedly at the heart of this dispute. Caribe's basic claim is that it could not 
compete with dealers located in the continental United States because those dealers' prices for BMW automobiles were 
allegedly too low to permit Caribe to compete. Yet, in its Sherman Act claim, Caribe contends that it has been damaged, through 
the loss of profits, by its alleged inability to raise its prices above a level purportedly set by its supplier. Surely, Caribe cannot 
have it both ways. "
153,10," Among its arguments, Caribe places great emphasis on the public policy behind keeping antitrust suits in the United States, 
and avoiding two separate actions involving BMW AG and BMW NA. We need not consider these arguments given our dismissal 
of the claims against BMW NA."
153,11," Cf. Julia L. Erickson, Forum Selection Clauses in Light of the Erie Doctrine and Federal Common Law: Stewart Organization 
v. Ricoh Corporation, 72 Minn. L. Rev. 1090 (1988) (for the proposition that after the Supreme Court's Stewart opinion, 487 U.S. 
22, 108 S. Ct. 2239, 101 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1988), only federal common law applies to forum-selection clauses). "
155,12," The lower courts in The Bremen approached the motion to dismiss as one under forum non conveniens, that is, whether the 
movant could prove that the London forum was more convenient than the Tampa forum. The Supreme Court said that this was 
the wrong approach since the contract ""expressly resolved that issue [of convenience of forum]. The correct approach would 
have been to enforce the forum clause specifically unless [non-movant] could clearly show that enforcement would be 
unreasonable or unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching."" Id. at 15. Various federal 
courts have applied this approach, that is, specifically enforcing the forum-selection clause rather than analyzing the forum non 
conveniens doctrine. See, e.g., Crown Beverage Co. v. Cerveceria Moctezuma, 663 F.2d 886 (9th Cir. 1981) (antitrust and 
distributorship contract between American and foreign companies providing for Mexican forum); Coastal Steel Corporation v. 
Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., 709 F.2d 190 (3d Cir. 1983) (England); Warner & Swasey Co. v. Salvagnini Transferica, 633 F. 
Supp. 1209 (W.D.N.Y.), aff'd on basis of opinion below, 806 F.2d 1045 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Italy); Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci, 858 
F.2d 515 (9th Cir. 1988) (Italy) (similar facts); Bonny v. Society of Lloyd's, 784 F. Supp. 1350 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (England); Riley 
v. Kingsley Underwriting Agencies, 969 F.2d 953 (10th Cir. 1992) (England); and Paper Express Ltd. v. Pfankuch Maschinen,

156,13," The clause in Bense read: ""the exclusive venue of any suits or causes of action arising directly or indirectly from this 
Agreement shall be in Dallas County, Texas."" "
157,14," Also, the fact that Germany has a civilist tradition and jurisdiction similar in many ways to Puerto Rico's code-ruled system, 
would seem more favorable than not."
157,15," The Bremen Court has said about this issue that one of the compelling factors to enforce forum-selection clauses is that ""at 
the very least [they are] an effort to eliminate all uncertainty as to the nature, location and outlook of the forum in which these 
companies of differing nationalities might find themselves . . . . The elimination of all such uncertainties by agreeing in advance "
158,," on a forum acceptable to both parties is an indispensable element in international trade, commerce and contracting."" The

171,1," Delong I, Delong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., 840 F.2d 843 (11th Cir.1988), involved issues of personal

174,2," Effective December, 1991, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) refers to such motions as renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law. 
Since these motions were filed before the amendment became effective, we use the old language of motion for ""judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict"" or ""JNOV."" "
178,3," Q. [By Mr. Coe]: Given his perfect setup and his positioning and his competitive pricing, Doctor, there's not a reason in the 
world why he [DeLong] can't capture all of Pratt's business selling Wisconsin Porcelain, Abrasive Finishing, Capco, Vibra-finish 
or anybody else he can get approved, is there, Ceratech; isn't that true? [Wisconsin Porcelain, Abrasive Finishing, Capco, and 
Ceratech are competing manufacturers of ceramic media.] "
190,1," Plaintiff enters into purchase agreements with manufacturers years in advance of the date on which the planes will be ready for 
delivery. In that sense plaintiff is a consumer. In addition, however, plaintiff routinely sells its interest in these planes/purchase 
agreements shortly before the planes are ready for delivery. Thus, in some instances plaintiff is competing with the manufacturer 
who is also selling another such product, at the same time, to the same consumers. "
192,2," Plaintiff brought a separate action against the Falcon Jet Corporation, a manufacturer of business jet aircraft that is not a party 
to this suit. The Falcon Jet litigation involved, in part, the same price fixing conspiracy. The Falcon Jet Settlement contained an 
express allocation of the monies received among claims and attorneys' fees. Only $ 1 was allocated to the category of ""all other 
claims"" which included the antitrust claims arising out of the price fixing conspiracy. Defendant argues that the $ 1 allocation was 
made in bad faith and that a substantially greater portion of the settlement should be set off from the jury's verdict in this suit."
192,3," Although not specifically headed in its briefs, defendant also argues that the district court should have granted its post trial 
motion for judgment nunc pro tunc dismissing the complaint on the ground that the trebled jury verdict was wholly setoff by the 
amounts received by plaintiff in the prior settlements. We cannot find that the district court erred in declining to grant this relief 
post-trial. We so conclude because, as we have held, defendant was not entitled to pretrial judgment. "
193,4," Plaintiff also received an additional $ 400,000 in settlement of any antitrust claims it might have had against GAC."
193,5," Plaintiff attempts to bolster its argument by asserting that it would never have agreed to cancel the purchase agreement 
because such a cancellation would have resulted in the loss of a $ 1,000,000 tax deduction. This argument was not raised 
before the district court and we decline to address it. See Knop v. McMahan, 872 F.2d 1132, 1143 n.20 (3rd Cir. 1989). "
194,6," The parties do not explicitly contend that the resolution of this issue requires us to determine whether federal or state law 
applies. In either event, we think that the same considerations of preventing duplicative recovery would obtain. See Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 885(3) (1979). "
195,7," As the district court stated: The Second Mitsubishi Settlement Agreement, although releasing Mitsubishi from any claims that could have arisen out of 
the options in the First Mitsubishi Settlement Agreement, also releases it from causes of action ""specifically including but 
not limited to all causes of action pleaded or that could have been pleaded or asserted in"" this action. Plaintiff[] [has] not 
explained this language away. Nor [has it] explained away the fact that . . . . the approximate value of each of plaintiff['s] 
three options . . . was $ 600,000. The amount of cash transferred in the second Mitsubishi settlement thus demonstrates 
the value of the options conveyed in the first Mitsubishi settlement. (citation omitted)."
195,8," Mr. Hotta's affidavit states, in pertinent part: (3) The claims threatened by Gulfstream III Associates, Inc. and Gulfstream IV Associates, Inc. in the fall of 1986 related to 
alleged misrepresentations pertaining to the term of sale of a Diamond II aircraft and an option to purchase two additional 
Diamond II aircraft. The claims were threatened under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and were viewed as 
serious claims by myself and Mitsubishi's outside counsel, the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski. (4) Mitsubishi denied liability, but agreed to settle these claims in December, 1986 for $ 1.8 million, which represented 
threatened single damages under the Texas statute, which provides for treble damages plus attorneys' fees. (J.A. at 913). "
196,9, See supra note 2. 
197,10," Because we have affirmed the judgment here, it is unnecessary to consider on these appeals whether, as defendant asserts, 
all or some part of the settlement in the Falcon Jet litigation should also have been set off against the verdict. See supra note 2. "
198,11," The Purchase Agreement Assignment provided that Texas law would govern its provisions (J.A. 360); New Jersey is of course 
the forum state; and the original Purchase Agreement provided that Georgia law would apply to its provisions (J.A. 416). 
Because we conclude that federal common law governs the assignment of an antitrust cause of action, there is no issue as to 
what state's law would apply. "
200,12," The district court in its opinion of August 30, 1990, rejecting Cessna's argument that Gulfstream III Associates was not a direct 
purchaser and thus lacked standing, indicated that ""Cessna does not dispute plaintiff['s] contentions that plaintiff[] remained 
liable for the balance of the contract price"" after the assignment. In its opening brief on the appeal, Cessna did not dispute this 
statement, though in its reply brief it equivocated, indicating that it was ""assuming, for argument's sake"" that Gulfstream III 
Associates remained liable. We need not pursue the point because even if we concluded that the assignment terminated 
Gulfstream III Associates' liability under the original agreement, we would not change our result."
200,13," My discussion presumes that the present state of the law would not permit set-offs to be applied against a fee award. See 
Auwood v. Harry Brandt Booking Office, Inc., 850 F.2d 884, 894 (2d Cir. 1988). "
203,14," Cessna did not offer to pay Gulfstream III Associates' fees when it made its pretrial motion for summary judgment, so I do not 
consider the implications of such an offer in this case. "
204,15," There is no dispute about the inclusion of $ 225,000, which was the total cash received from the First Mitsubishi Settlement."
204,16," Notwithstanding the district court's reference to ""three options,"" Gulfstream III agreed to purchase one Diamond II aircraft and 
had only conditional options to purchase two more, dependent on Gulfstream III taking financial delivery of the first aircraft. App. 
at 819, 822-23. "
205,17," Specifically, the majority's rule states: Where a plaintiff executes a general settlement instrument which settles multiple claims with a defendant, but a non-settling 
defendant is not a party to that agreement, the non-settling defendant need show only that the plaintiff settled a claim on 
which the non-settling defendant was found liable at trial. If the defendant makes this showing, the burden then shifts to the 
plaintiff to prove that, under the terms of its agreement with the settling defendant, the settlement or part thereof did not 
represent damages arising under the same theory of liability as those forming the basis for the jury award. The view we 
adopt is consistent with the rule that a settling plaintiff is entitled to only one full recovery while at the same time it protects 
the plaintiff from the application of amounts received in settlement of unrelated claims. Majority typescript op. at 26. "
206,18," See Texas Deceptive Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. §§ 17.41-17.63 (Vernon 
1987). "
220,1," The steel company plaintiffs are Republic Steel Corporation, Jones & Laughlin Steel Incorporated (which includes Youngstown 
Sheet and Tube Company), National Steel Corporation, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and Sharon Steel Corporation. 
The dock company plaintiffs are Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority and Codan Corporation (Erie), Toledo World 
Terminal, Inc., and David W. Reaney and Reaney Dock Company. The trucking company plaintiffs are Wills Trucking, Inc., 
Tauro Brothers Trucking Company, and C.D. Ambrosia Trucking Company. Toledo World and Wills Trucking are corporate 
affiliates and will be referred to as the Wills plaintiffs. When the action commenced, the railroad companies named as defendants were the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad 
Company, (""B&LE""), Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, CSX Corporation, 
Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Company, Consolidated Rail Corporation, Norfolk and Western Railway Company, Norfolk 
Southern Corporation, Penn Central Transportation Company and Penn Central Corporation. The claims against all of the 
defendants, except B&LE, were settled or dismissed before or during trial, leaving B&LE as the sole defendant. "
221,2," The Interstate Commerce Act was originally enacted in 1887 and was codified and recodified with little change until its 
substantial revision in 1980 by the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act and the Staggers Rail Act. These changes 
are not implicated here. "
226,3," According to one commentator, secret price fixing and retaliation against carriers exercising independent action were not 
unusual in the 1960s and 1970s, yet the ICC was apparently unaware of such activity until government and private antitrust 
lawsuits focused upon the problem. Dissatisfaction with the ICC's overall performance led to the 1980 enactment of the Staggers 
Rail Act which substantially deregulated rail and motor transportation. The legislation endorsed greater competition as the best 
way to stimulate transportation industry development, accomplished by circumscribing the immunity of a rate bureau's activities 
and by substantially removing from the ICC its rate setting function. This 1980 statute did not specifically overrule Keogh, but 
significantly undermines its central rationale. See William Eskridge, Jr., Overruling Statutory Precedents, 76 Geo. L.J. 1361 
(1988). "
227,4," National Steel, which invested in and operated its own self-unloading vessel, was a competitor, not a customer of the railroads. 
Thus, as to the various immunity issues, it stands in the shoes of the dock and trucking companies and not the steel companies."
227,5," The district court elsewhere described these claims in terms of damages resulting from the defendants' conduct as: damages directly resulting from defendants' elimination of competitive non-railroad dock facilities from the market of 
providing unloading and trans-shipment services to plaintiffs . . . [and] damages directly resulting from the defendants' 
elimination of competition from trucking in the market of inland transportation services to plaintiffs. App. at 372. "
230,6," B&LE contends that the Supreme Court applied Keogh to bar suits by a competitor in Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company, 324 U.S. 439, 89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945). In that case, the state of Georgia alleged that the defendant 
railroads had ""fixed arbitrary and non-competitive rates and charges for transportation of freight by railroad to and from Georgia 
so as to prefer the ports of other states over the ports of Georgia."" Id. at 443. Georgia sued both in its parens patriae capacity 
and as owner of a railroad and other public institutions.  Id. at 447. Although Georgia's ownership of a railroad placed it in 
competition with the defendants, the court clearly focused on Georgia's parens patriae claim and treated the injury to the state 
as proprietor merely as ""make weight."" Id. at 450. In dismissing Georgia's claims for antitrust damages, the Court held: We think it is clear from the Keogh case alone that Georgia may not recover damages even if the conspiracy alleged were 
shown to exist. . . . The [Keogh] Court held . . . the legal rights of a shipper against a carrier in respect to a rate are to be 
measured by the published tariff. That rate until suspended or set aside was for all purposes the legal rate as between 
shipper and carrier and may not be varied or enlarged either by the contract or tort of the carrier. And it added: ""This 
stringent rule prevails, because otherwise the paramount purpose of Congress -- prevention of unjust discrimination -- 
might be defeated. If a shipper could recover under § 7 of the Anti-Trust Act for damages resulting from the exaction of a 
rate higher than that which would otherwise have prevailed, the amount recovered might, like a rebate, operate to give him 
a preference over his trade competitors."" 260 U.S. p.163."
230,324," U.S. at 453. Despite B&LE's diligence in presenting the pleadings in Georgia to support its cast of the case as one between competitors, it is 
obvious that in rendering its decision the Court's focus was on Georgia's claims as a customer. We, therefore, do not construe 
Georgia as Supreme Court precedent to apply Keogh to bar competitor suits. "
231,7," To reconcile its holding with that in the United States v. Bessemer & L.E. case, the court of appeals in Pinney Dock drew a 
distinction between the criminal enforcement role of the United States and the remedial nature of the ICC's jurisdiction.  Pinney 
Dock, 838 F.2d 1445 at 1460-61, n.15. We, to the contrary, do not find these role classifications as indicative of whether the 
court properly exercised its discretion in retaining jurisdiction. The same conspiratorial conduct described in the criminal 
indictment is the subject of this civil antitrust suit."
231,8," B &LE, citing, as authority, 49 U.S.C. § 10706(a)(3)(C)(ii) of the Staggers Act, also challenges the issue's submission to the 
jury in the first instance. This issue has not been preserved for review, nor would it be of merit. The Staggers Act, enacted in 
1980, has no application to this case. "
232,9," In Alberta Gas Chemicals Ltd. v. E. I. DuPont deNemours & Co., 826 F.2d 1235 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1059, 
100 L. Ed. 2d 930, 108 S. Ct. 2830 (1988), we addressed whether antitrust injury and antitrust standing are distinct doctrines: It has been suggested that although standing is closely related to antitrust injury, the two concepts are distinct. HN16[
] 
Once antitrust injury has been demonstrated by a causal relationship between the harm and the challenged aspect of the 
alleged violation, standing analysis is employed to search for the most effective plaintiff from among those who have 
suffered loss. However, in the sense that plaintiffs who sustain no antitrust injury may not recover, they may be loosely said 
to lack standing. (Citations omitted.) Id. at 1240."
232,10," In Illinois Brick, a defendant manufacturer of bricks sold its product to masonry contractors, who provided the materials to 
building contractors. The contractor incorporated the bricks into buildings owned by the plaintiffs, numerous government entities. 
The plaintiffs claimed that they were injured by the prior purchasers' payment of excessive prices of the bricks charged by the 
manufacturer. The Court held that § 4 did not permit these indirect purchasers, with two narrow exceptions, to recover for the 
overcharge passed through the chain of distribution. The Court relied heavily on its earlier decision in Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. 
United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968), that a seller who imposes an illegal 
overcharge on a direct purchaser cannot escape antitrust liability by arguing that the first purchaser passed on the illegal 
overcharge by increasing the prices it charged for the products when it sold them to the public. In Hanover Shoe, the Court 
rejected the pass-on theory for a seller and in Illinois Brick made the symmetrical decision, consistent with Hanover, to disallow 
an offensive use of the theory. Although Illinois Brick is often cited as the standard bearer of antitrust standing cases, we note that the Court specifically stated 
that ""we do not address the standing issue. . . ."" 431 U.S. at 728 n.7. Instead, the Court based its holding on the grounds of 
remoteness of injury and defined this consideration as analytically distinct from the issue of standing."
232,11," National Steel Corporation, which owned and operated self-unloader vessels, offered substantial evidence that their intent 
and readiness to enter into the lake transportation business was frustrated by the conspiracy. National Steel actually purchased 
its own self-unloading vessel, the Stinson, in 1974. Because National Steel transported its own iron ore, rather than contracting "
233,," with outside vessel companies, it did not offer evidence concerning lake transport damages. Also, because it was a vessel 
owner, notions of indirect injury concerning dock handling charges do not apply to National Steel. Further, National's claim is not 
jeopardized by the threat of overlapping damages as no other plaintiff suffered this distinct type of injury."
233,12," Although Pinney was a privately owned dock, the plaintiffs claimed that the rates charged by it were artificially inflated by the 
conspiracy. According to the plaintiffs, because Pinney was the only private game in town, it was not required to set its prices 
based upon competition from other privately owned docks."
233,13," In addition to the three steel companies awarded lake transport damages, Sharon Steel and National Steel were awarded 
dock handling damages."
233,14," Because the private dock companies themselves were direct competitors of the railroads and because they were injured by 
the conspiracy's goal to preclude them from market entry, no standing problem is posed by their quest for damages."
233,15," The three companies averred in discovery that they were not in the business of purchasing, leasing, chartering, hiring or 
investing in vessels in the transshipment of bulk commodities over the Great Lakes. Indeed, the district court originally dismissed 
the self-unloader damage claims asserted by the steel companies, but gave the steel companies the opportunity to amend their 
complaints to allege the requisite ownership. To avoid a subsequent dismissal, the steel companies amended their complaint to 
allege that they had ownership interests in the vessels. However, the steel companies have not provided any record reference 
which points to an intent or preparation on their part to acquire self-unloaders. The only evidence of de facto ownership of the 
vessels that was offered was admitted during the damages phase of the trial. Nor were we directed towards evidence identifying 
the specifics of contractual relationships that would indicate ownership interests by means of either significant financing or other 
proprietary rights. Moreover the jury was not required to find that the steel companies intended to acquire self-unloaders and were prevented by 
the conspiracy from doing so. The specific question submitted to the jury was whether the plaintiffs suffered antitrust injury from 
""foreclosure and delay in the utilization of self-unloading vessels for the delivery of iron ore."" (Emphasis added.) True, the term 
""utilization"" could be read to encompass an ""ownership"" determination, but, given the specific nature of the district court's 
reliance on the finding to confer entitlement to recovery, a definite statement by the jury that the lease and contracts conferred 
de facto ownership would be necessary. Given the evidence, we express concern that such a finding is supported. "
234,16," See generally James R. McCall, The Disaggregation of the Damages Requirement in Private Monopolization Matters, 62 
Notre Dame L. Rev. 643 (1987) and Nat Stern and Kevin B. Getzendenner, Gauging the Impact of Associated General 
Contractors on Antitrust Standing under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 20 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 159 (1986), outlining the evolution of 
the antitrust standing doctrine."
234,17,"  There is a similarity between the struggle of common-law judges to articulate a precise definition of the concept of 
""proximate cause,"" and the struggle of federal judges to articulate a precise test to determine whether a party injured by an 
antitrust violation may recover treble damages. It is common ground that the judicial remedy cannot encompass every 
conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing. In both situations the infinite variety of claims that may arise 
make it virtually impossible to announce a blackletter rule that will dictate the result in every case. Instead, previously 
decided cases identify factors that circumscribe and guide the exercise of judgment in deciding whether the law affords a 
remedy in specific circumstances."

235,19," Some elucidation concerning the balancing of factors was provided by the Court in its decision last term in Holmes v. 
Securities Investor Protection Corp., 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311 (1992). In discussing the right to sue under the treble 
damages provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (borrowed from the Clayton Act), the Court 
stressed that although the AGC case did not identify directness of relationship between plaintiff and defendant as the ""sole 
requisite of Clayton Act causation,"" id. at 1318, directness of injury was construed as the focal point by which the remainder of 
the AGC factors are guided: First, the less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributed to 
the violation as distinct from other independent factors. Second, quite apart from the facts of proving factual causation, 
recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among 
plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries. And finally, the 
need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly 
injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general without any of the problems 
attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely. Id. (citations omitted)."
235,20," Before we undertake such an analysis, the most recent Supreme Court case discussing standing must be noted. This case is 
Kansas v. Utilicorp United Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 2807 (1990), where antitrust claims arose out of an 
alleged conspiracy to inflate natural gas prices. Defendants in this action were three companies and two limited partnerships that 
produced natural gas. Among the plaintiffs were three investor-owned public utilities that had purchased gas directly from the 
pipeline in the states of Kansas and Missouri, whose attorneys general asserted claims in parens patriae capacity on behalf of 
its residential customers who purchased gas from the utilities. The gas producers in defense claimed that the public utilities, despite the fact that they were direct purchasers, lacked standing 
because they had raised their own prices to offset the illegal charge, and thus had not suffered any damage. The district court 
rejected this pass-on defense and, moreover, dismissed the states as parens patriae on the same theory. The court of appeals 
affirmed. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court rejected the States' argument that indirect purchaser standing should be allowed in cases 
involving a regulated activity that has passed on 100 percent of an overcharge to its customers. The Court opined that the mere 
fact that a price rise followed an unlawful cost increase was insufficient proof of antitrust injury. The indirect purchaser, stated the 
Court, would have to show that the utilities had not incurred any damage from the overcharge and would have to demonstrate 
that the utilities would not have raised prices had there not been an increase in fuel costs. The Court then took the opportunity to 
caution courts not to carve out exceptions to the general rules announced in its prior standing decisions: The rationales underlying Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick will not apply with equal force in all cases. We nonetheless 
believe that ample jurisdiction exists for our stated decision 'not to carve out exceptions to the [direct purchaser] rule for "
236,," particular types of markets'. The possibility of allowing an exception, even in rather meritorious circumstances, would 
undermine the rule."
236,497," U.S. at 216, quoting Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 744. B&LE avers that this language in Utilicorp prohibits us from examining the facts of this case to determine if an exception lies 
under Illinois Brick. Utilicorp, however, does not rule because it concerned the pass-on theory of standing and whether the 
regulated consumer-energy market, or any other market involving a distribution chain that resembled a series of ""cost-plus"" 
contracts, would justify an exception to the unavailability of standing on the basis of the pass-on theory. The broader concerns of 
Illinois Brick and later cases are discussed infra."
236,21," We do not, however, interpret this statement in Mid-West Paper or the ""indirect purchaser"" rule of Illinois Brick as announcing 
a strict prohibition against recovery by indirect purchasers. Despite the Court's remark in Utilicorp that permitting parties with 
indirect purchaser status to proceed with a § 4 claim would require it to ""create an exception to the direct purchaser rule 
established in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick . . . ."" 497 U.S. at 207, we discount the import of this language because the 
Utilicorp decision was addressing the peculiarities of applying the pass-on theory of standing in the public utility arena. See n.9, 
supra. "
237,22," An illustration of why the steel companies' damages would not necessarily duplicate the damages of the vessel and docking 
companies can be made by hypothesizing that the steel companies paid $ 10 in transport and docking charges for a ton of ore 
under the old system; with self-unloading bulkers they would pay $ 7 for transport and docking the same amount of ore. The "
238,," steel company damages would then be $ 3, the difference between $ 10 and $ 7. The vessel and docking companies' lost profits 
would, however, have been incorporated in the $ 7 and thus would not be duplicative. "
239,23," In its reply brief, B &LE also contends that it was unfairly prejudiced by what it refers to as the trial court's ""subsequential 
overruling of PTO 49"" in its judgment n.o.v. opinion. It does not, however, detail the form of the prejudice such as an allegation 
that it would have presented its evidence in a different manner or objected to testimony offered by the trucking companies 
regarding the fact of damage. "
240,24," B&LE's argument and this discussion do not apply to the trucking company plaintiffs and Reaney, who had no knowledge of 
the conspiracy until events within the limitations period. "
241,25," Although B&LE has couched its challenge in terms of the limitations period and we therefore discuss the challenge in that 
context, we note that, at root, B&LE is arguing about proximate cause and attempting to limit its liability by seeking to narrow the 
scope of causes from the conspiracy itself (within the limitations period) to particular ""overt acts"" (within the limitations period). 
This argument formulation accounts for the district court's ""cause and effect"" description. We are in agreement with this 
observation by the district court."
241,26," Our decision in Pennsylvania Dental Asso. v. Medical Service Asso., 815 F.2d 270 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 851, 98 L. 
Ed. 2d 109, 108 S. Ct. 153 (1987), upon which B &LE in part relies, is not to the contrary. Pennsylvania Dental was concerned 
with the resolutions of various dental associations not to deal with Blue Cross and with the concomitant withdrawal from Blue 
Cross participation by numerous dentists. Most of the resolutions and withdrawals had taken place outside the limitations 
periods, but as none of the resolutions had been rescinded and there was evidence of overt acts -- within the limitations period -- 
in furtherance of the conspiracy, we held that the plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief, if subject to the limitations period at all, was 
not time barred.  Id. at 278. Furthermore, citing Hanover Shoe, we opined that ""damages caused by any overt act taking place 
from [the beginning of the limitations period] may also be recovered."" Id. Although the clause, read narrowly, appears to support 
B&LE's proposed rule that damages must be tied to particular overt acts, it is clear from the context of the opinion that the 
conspiracy as a whole caused damages. The opinion, read in proper context, thus reiterates the rule that damages caused by 
injurious activity (such as an conspiracy active within the limitations period) could be recoverable. "
242,27," Moreover, the district court alternatively found, on sufficient evidence, that damages were not ascertainable until within the 
limitations period. This would suffice to bring them within the Zenith exception for speculative damages. See Zenith, 401 U.S. at 
338-42. Because we have concluded that an active, injury-causing conspiracy suffices to bring the cause of action, we need not 
address B&LE's disputations regarding Zenith's exception to the rule that an action for damages occurs at the time of an 
injurious act."
242,28," It is not clear from the caselaw that laches, an equitable defense, applies only to defenses at equity. See Smith v. Smith, 168 
Ohio St. 447, 156 N.E.2d 113, 120 (Ohio 1954) (recognizing equitable nature of laches doctrine, but noting its applicability in 
certain statutory actions). See also Thirty-Four Corp. v. Sixty-Seven Corp., 15 Ohio St. 3d 350, 474 N.E.2d 295, 298 (Ohio 1984) 
(court referred to mortgage foreclosure action as ""lawsuit"" and considered whether laches applied). HN22[
] It is also the law in 
Ohio that assertion of the defense and its applicability is one which should be presented to the jury. See, Ferree v. Sparks, 77 
Ohio App. 3d 185, 601 N.E.2d 568, 570 (Ohio App.3d 1991) (evaluation of evidence concerning application of laches is for trier 
of fact). The jury's findings here concerning fraudulent concealment are not conclusive as to the steel companies, and, as to 
Erie, are not applicable since the jury found that the Erie plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the conspiracy prior to October 14, 
1977. "
244,29," B&LE contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in not instructing the jury on the fact and import of market 
power. The primary ground for this assertion is that the plaintiffs claimed and recovered damages for ore moved outside the 
lower Lake Erie region, on Lake Michigan and Lake Detroit. We note that B&LE stipulated to the tonnages of ore involved in the conspiracy. During the damages charge, the district court 
informed the jury that ""everyone agrees on the total amount of pelletized ore that was transported during the relevant time."" App. 
at 6338. Because B&LE agreed to the specific tonnages involved in the conspiracy, it cannot now come forward and dispute the 
amount as improperly including tonnages which were moved beyond the geographic range of the conspiracy. "
250,30," B &LE also doubts that an award of prejudgment interest is permissible for damages awarded under Ohio's Valentine Act. 
Since we are denying the cross-appeal on other grounds, we need not reach this issue. "
251,31," We have signified a change from the text which requires some explanation. In the transcript, the word ""railroads"" appeared 
where we have bracketed ""private docks."" We altered the quote because it is obvious from the full context, that the reference 
was to the dock companies and not the defendant. We are confident, too, that, in hearing the instruction as a whole, the jury 
understood the court to be discussing the burden of the dock companies. "
252,32," The district court's clouding of the fact and the amount of damages is exemplified in a portion of its judgment n.o.v. opinion 
where it observed: ""Throughout both phases of the trial, the defendant vehemently argued, and sought to prove, that any 
damages actually sustained by the plaintiffs were attributable to economic factors other than the alleged conspiracy . . . ."" App. 
at 2129 (emphasis added). "
256,1," The Honorable Diana E. Murphy, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota. "
266,1," Ortho is also involved in the ""diagnostic"" market, which is composed of hospitals, commercial laboratories and other facilities 
which test blood to diagnose disease. The diagnostic market is not implicated in this lawsuit, but Ortho's role in that market is a 
factor which increases the improbability of Ortho exiting the blood-screening market as a result of the CCBC contract. "
267,2," Both companies also compete in the international market, but there is no dispute that the relevant geographic market for 
purposes of this lawsuit is the United States. We note the participation in the international market because it casts doubt on 
Ortho's claim that it will greatly reduce its expenditures for research and development if the contract at issue here takes effect. "
268,3," In its five-assay package, Ortho offered its own HTLV test, which is not generally accepted on the market, and an HIV 1/2 test 
manufactured by Genetic Systems (one of the two smaller competitors). Ortho also offered its LOMS computer software system, 
although Ortho alleges that the CCBC understood that the system was not yet ready to be implemented. "
269,4," If a customer wishes to buy Abbott's HTLV and HIV-1/2 together with its HCV, the price for the three would cost 7.57, while its 
price for all five of the tests would be 7.37, including the DMS system which is not available with the three assay package. 
Therefore, in order to sell the remaining two tests at a competitive price, Ortho alleges it would have to give the two tests away, 
plus give the customer a .20 cent rebate and a free data management software system, which it does not have at this time. While perhaps not as dramatic as that example, other combinations of tests produce similar pricing effects. For example, if a 
customer were to buy all the tests except the HBsAg test from Abbott, the price for the Abbott tests would be $ 7.30. Therefore, 
to meet the price of the Abbott five-test package, $ 7.37, Ortho alleges it would have to offer the HBsAg test for 0.7 cents. "
271,5," See transcript, proceedings, May 21, 1993 at 49 where plaintiff's counsel argued on the basis of a three year interval before 
trial on the merits could be held. Plaintiff's counsel later agreed that if an injunction were denied plaintiff could be ready for trial 
on the merits in October. Transcript at 67. Defendant's counsel asserted that one year would be required to complete pre-trial 
discovery. We believe that no good reason exists why this case could not be ready for trial on the merits by November 15, 1993. 
Transcript at 66. "
272,6," For the purposes of this motion, we have concluded that it is inappropriate to exclude the ARC from the calculation of market 
share, as Abbott would have the Court do. The only reason offered for such exclusion is that the ARC contract will be expiring at 
the end of the year. By that logic, we should include an estimate of the new market share which Abbott will enjoy by virtue of the 
new CCBC master contract. Rather than engage in such speculation, we prefer to assess market share as it exists at this point 
in time. "
288,1," Since Dr. Williamson is the sole owner of Pensacola Diagnostic, I will frequently refer to both as ""the plaintiff"" for brevity 
purposes. As a practical matter, their interests are identical."
288,2," Defendants claim that plaintiff's patient logs show that, from 1984 and 1989, only 7% to 15% of Pensacola Diagnostic's 
business consisted of ""self-referrals"", i.e. patients who come directly to plaintiff for breast care. In such case, plaintiff would 
perform diagnostic functions, and then would refer the patient to a physician or surgeon if further care was necessary. Plaintiff 
claims that self-referrals accounted for approximately half of her business."
288,3," At least one of these patients was a ""self-referral"" for whom Dr. Williamson was acting as the ""primary care"" physician. 
Accordingly, she referred the patient to a surgeon who then admitted the patient to Baptist. Since receiving her privileges at 
Baptist, Dr. Williamson has not attempted to admit any patients there. Nor has she ever admitted any patient to any hospital 
where she has privileges. "
289,4," Pensacola and the bordering communities of Cantonment, Gulf Breeze and Milton account for 82% of Sacred Heart's patients."
289,5," Defendant Albert A. Post, M.D. is a radiologist and a shareholder in PRC. He also is chairman of Sacred Heart's radiology 
department. Dr. Post's partners in PRC, S. Randall Hobgood, M.D., William R. Balchunas, M.D., and Anthony J. DeRaimo, M.D., 
all were originally named as defendants in plaintiff's complaint. They all have been dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of the 
plaintiffs. (Doc. 284)."
289,6," S. Randall Hobgood, M.D., another of PRC's physician partners, expressed similar concerns to Dr. Whitcomb."
289,7," Indeed, given the wording of the bylaws, it is doubtful whether Dr. Whitcomb had authority to process the application."
289,8," PRC and Dr. Post correctly point out that Dr. Williamson's description of her conversation with Ms. Beem is inadmissible 
hearsay as to them. However, PRC and Dr. Post have based their motion in part on the deposition testimony of Dr. Whitcomb in 
which he admits both that his office was in contact with Dr. Williamson during this time period, and that Ms. Beem did have a 
conversation with Dr. Williamson, the substance of which was substantially as alleged by plaintiffs. Thus, I reiterate that the fact 
of the phone call and the essentials of its content are not in dispute as to either Sacred Heart or PRC and Dr. Post. The only 
dispute over the conversation relates to interpretation of Ms. Beem's statement that Dr. Williamson ""did not need privileges"". "
290,," Oddly, Dr. Williamson has submitted an excerpt of Ms. Beem's deposition testimony, in which she confirms Sacred Heart's 
interpretation of the conversation, i.e. Ms. Beem told Dr. Williamson she would not need privileges because the radiology 
department would extend her the courtesy of visiting her patients and viewing their films."
290,9," In the original order, I determined that this conversation was hearsay. However, upon further reflection, it appears to be an 
adopted admission under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(B), and if so, not hearsay."
290,10," Though Sacred Heart has attached to its motion for summary judgment the minutes of other Executive Committee meetings in 
which plaintiff's application was discussed, the minutes of this meeting are absent."
290,11," Dr. Williamson claims that, at this time, independent radiologist Thomas Brown, M.D. had privileges at Sacred Heart even 
though he was not then a member of PRC. Sacred Heart points out, however, that, at one time, Dr. Brown was associated with 
PRC. After he severed this relationship, Dr. Brown did remain a member of the Sacred Heart staff, but was not permitted to 
furnish radiology services or exercise clinical privileges. Dr. Brown resigned from the staff in December 1985, and has not had 
staff privileges since then."
290,12," Only the Board of Directors can grant staff membership and privileges. Under the normal procedure, an application for medical 
staff privileges is reviewed first by the Credentials Committee. After examining the applicants qualifications and receiving input 
from the relevant medical department, the Credentials Committee makes findings as to the applicant's qualifications and "
291,," recommends either approval or denial. It then passes the application on to the Executive Committee of the Medical and Dental 
Staff for review. After making its own recommendation, the Executive Committee passes the application on to the Board of 
Directors of Sacred Heart Hospital for final action."
291,13," In addition to matters of general concern, the Bylaws of the Medical and Dental Staff of Sacred Heart Hospital contain the 
Rules and Regulations for each medical department within the hospital. The delineation of privileges for a particular department 
is listed within the ""Rules and Regulations"" pertaining to that department. Subject to the approval of the Bylaws Committee, the 
Executive Committee, the General Staff and the Board of Directors, each department has the power to adopt its own Rules and 
Regulations."
291,14," Amending the bylaws to incorporate the rules changes was a four-step process. First, the department changing its rules drafts 
a proposed rule. The Bylaws Committee then reviews the proposed rule and makes any changes it deems appropriate. Next the 
proposed rule goes before the Executive Committee for input from the administration. If the Executive Committee makes any 
changes, the proposed rule goes back to the department for review, and the process starts over. Once the Executive Committee 
approves the rule, the general staff votes on it. Finally, if the general staff approves the change, it is submitted to the Board of 
Directors for final approval and incorporation into the bylaws."
291,15," Both definitions appeared in the minutes of an October 23, 1984, Department of Internal Medicine monthly meeting and 
remained unchanged throughout the amendment process. "
292,16," This wording does appear in a copy of the bylaws plaintiff has submitted in support of her opposition to defendants' original 
motions for summary judgment. (See App. III to plaintiff's opposition at p. 213-14). This copy is dated March 1985. Another copy 
of the bylaws bearing the same date, and also submitted by the plaintiff, does not include the words ""primary care"" before 
""medically oriented specialty"". (See Id. at 158-59)."
292,17," Dr. Williamson also had completed a three year residency in diagnostic radiology. During that residency, she rotated through 
the different sections of diagnostic radiology including angiography and interventional radiology. During these rotations, Dr. 
Williamson visited patients prior to performing the necessary procedures, and discussed with them the procedures and the 
associated risks. She issued premedication orders and post procedure orders on these patients including antiocoagulant or 
other medications required for the procedures. Most of the patients with whom Dr. Williamson dealt during her residency were 
referred to radiology for specific procedures by the admitting physician. However, in those cases where patients were admitted 
to the hospital by the radiology staff, the residents participated in taking medical histories and administering physical exams."
292,18, None of the radiologists sits on the Credentials Committee. 
293,19," Pensacola and the bordering communities of Cantonment, Gulf Breeze, and Milton account for 88.88% of Baptist's patients."
293,20," As described more fully below, at one time radiologists performed fetal ultrasound. Gradually, responsibility for performing the 
procedure shifted to obstetricians and perinatologists This is now the standard practice."
293,21," In their depositions, Wiley Howard Cooper, M.D. and William R. Bender, M.D., both of whom are principals in Radiology 
Associates, stated that the P.A. had no objection to Dr. Williamson obtaining staff membership at Baptist as long as she did not 
practice diagnostic radiology at the hospital. According to Drs. Cooper and Bender, both John Robbins, Baptist's chief 
administrator, and Spencer Mitchum, the hospital's attorney, told the physicians of Radiology Associates that the hospital 
considered the issue of medical staff membership separate from the issue of privileges. "
294,22," In her memorandum, plaintiff consistently mischaracterizes the nature of this policy, relying on a statement by counsel for 
Baptist at the deposition of Wiley Howard Cooper, M.D. to the effect that the Board of Directors had adopted a policy of keeping 
the issue of privileges separate from the issue of exclusive contracts. Plaintiff argues that Baptist had a policy that would have 
allowed the Executive Committee to grant limited privileges in the Department of Radiology so long as she promised not to 
practice diagnostic radiology at the hospital. The plain language of plaintiff's own evidence belies this interpretation. First, the Medical Staff Bylaws make no provisions for 
such partial privileges. Second, the minutes of the June 4 Executive Committee meeting clearly show that it was willing to grant 
Dr. Williamson privileges in a manner that was consistent with both the Bylaws and the exclusive contract. As discussed in the 
text, it subsequently wrote her a letter inviting her to explain her qualifications in an area not covered by the exclusive contract. "

affiliated hospital if the Applicant practices primarily within the central portion of the service area), and shall not have had 
any such privileges suspended, revoked, or otherwise terminated at any hospital anywhere . . . A ""Participating hospital"" still was defined as a ""Participating Provider that is a hospital,"" and included the newly recruited 
hospitals. However, ""Affiliated Hospital"" means Sacred Heart Hospital or Baptist Hospital of Pensacola, Florida, or any other Participating Hospital . . . directly or indirectly 
associated by ownership or control with Gulf Coast Diversified, Inc. or Mobile Diagnostics, Inc., which are the two hospital 
related Florida corporations that are stockholders in Health Options of Pensacola, Inc. ""Central portion of the service area"" is not defined in the bylaws, but it is undisputed that the term refers to the greater Pensacola 
area, including Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa Counties, along with parts of Walton County, Florida."
295,25," Defendant Keith Shearlock, M.D. is a nephrologist (a kidney specialist). It is undisputed that Dr. Shearlock does not compete 
with Dr. Williamson, and that, as a nephrologist, he would not refer patients to a radiologist such as Dr. Williamson. "
296,26," Plaintiff's clinic operated on a regular ""9 to 5"" type business schedule, and Dr. Williamson did not work nights or weekends. In 
addition, plaintiff's own figures show that association with PRC would have resulted in a decrease in her income. "
297,27," Obviously, if Sacred Heart had pursued both options, it would have ended up competing with itself. "
298,28," Section 4.6 of Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the Medical and Dental Staff of Sacred Heart Hospital provide: ""The Board [of 
Directors] may waive any qualification when in its discretion such waiver will serve the best interests of patient care in the 
hospital."" "
301,29," Defendants argue that Dr. Murphy's statements before the FTC are inadmissible hearsay. Actually, Dr. Murphy's statements 
may include hearsay within hearsay: The FTC testimony involves not only Dr. Murphy's own statements, but also Hardman's 
statements to Dr. Murphy. In the case of double hearsay, both levels of hearsay must fall within exception to the hearsay rule, or 
the entire statement is inadmissible. Dr. Murphy is now deceased. Plaintiff seems to be contending that these statements are 
within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, but that cannot be determined at this point."
301,30," These figures were complied by Sacred Heart from Dr. Williamson's patient logs. Instances where two physicians names were 
listed as referral sources have been counted as half referrals to each doctor. "
304,31," Gulf Coast Medical Arts Center is a group of several practices that pooled their resources to build an office complex. Sacred 
Heart is not associated with Gulf Coast Medical Arts Center."
304,32, Drs Belk and Irvin do not contend that there was any problem with Dr. Williamson's quality of care.
304,33," As discussed above, defendants' numbers do not differentiate between new referrals and repeat visits by old referrals. "
308,34," Dr. Williamson's clinic is adjacent to the Sacred Heart Hospital grounds, and is no farther from the surgi-center, which is free-
standing, than the Sacred Heart radiology department. "
309,35," As a matter of standard procedure, specimens entering or leaving the Pathology Department are transported by courier. 
However, on occasion, a patient or a doctor may bring a sample directly to the department for analysis. Sacred Heart employed 
its own couriers to transport specimens between different locations within the Sacred Heart complex."
309,36," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(4) provides: (4) Trial Preparation: Experts. Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the 
provisions of subdivision (b)((1) of this rule and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be 
obtained only as follows: (A)(i) A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to 
call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the "
310,," substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each 
opinion. "
311,37," Not all of the actions alleged to have been taken by the defendants necessarily qualify as ""professional review actions."" For 
example, the alleged actions taken to divert referrals from plaintiff to defendants do not so qualify. Thus, even if the HCQIA 
acted to bar liability for the denial of privileges, antitrust liability in theory still could exist with respect to such non-qualifying 
activities. "
316,38," Of course, plaintiffs argue that the treatment itself was evidence of a conspiracy. I address this issue below. Right now I am 
only dealing with plaintiff's argument that her treatment was anomalous, and therefore, evidence of pretext. The evidence shows 
that, with respect to Dr. Brown, it was not. "
319,39," I note that plaintiff never uses the term ""coercive reciprocal agreement"" in her pleadings or opposition to defendants' several 
motions."
319,40," The wording of Dr. Antonelli's contract is slightly different, and reads ""to the extent feasible, and in accordance with acceptable 
medical practice, and unless patient choice dictates otherwise."" "
320,41," Although it is not a part of the record, the affidavit of plaintiff's own expert establishes, by way of comparison, that Sacred 
Heart has only 28.3% of patient days, while Baptist and West Florida have 29.8% and 31.4%, respectively. Similarly, Sacred 
Heart has only 21.6% of the available beds, while Baptist and West Florida have 28.9% and 30.4%. Finally, Sacred Heart has 
35.8% of the admissions, while Baptist and West Florida have 24.6% and 27.6%, respectively. "
324,42," These figures in the record are based on revenues from procedures encompassed by plaintiff's specialty and were compiled 
by plaintiff's expert. The data omits figures for the privately-owned West Florida Regional Medical Center, an H.C.A. hospital, 
which is the major competitor of both Sacred Heart and Baptist, as well as the two other Pensacola hospitals, Navy and (at that 
time) University. "
325,43," Plaintiff's claim that the 1985 amendments were adopted for the specific purpose of excluding her from membership is without 
merit. Plaintiff did not obtain privileges at any of the outlying hospitals until 1987. Unless Health First's Board members could 
foretell the future, they would have no way of knowing that their actions would impact any particular individual. Additionally, I 
note that plaintiff was ineligible under both the original and amended version of the bylaws."
325,44," I emphasize that I am not dealing here with the conspiracy alleged by plaintiff. I already have determined that there was no 
conspiracy. Rather, I am looking at the fundamental structure of the HMO itself."
325,45," Defendants merely assert that plaintiff has failed to present evidence establishing the relevant geographic market. It is 
undisputed that over 80% of Health Options subscribers live within the greater Pensacola area. In addition, over 80% of Baptist's 
and Sacred Heart's patients reside in this geographic area. "
326,46," As discussed above, the product dimension of the relevant market is ""determined by the availability of substitutes to which 
consumers can turn in response to price increases and other existing or potential producer's ability to expand output."" L.A. 
Draper, supra, 735 F.2d at 423."
326,47," In a PPO, members are permitted to choose any physician or treatment facility they please. The insurer then reimburses the 
provider for a fixed amount per service or for a fixed percentage of the fee for the service. The provider then bills the subscriber 
for any outstanding balance. Many PPOs also have a deductible that the subscriber must pay out of his own pocket before he is 
eligible for reimbursement. "
329,*," Local Rule 47.5.1 provides: ""The publication of opinions that have no precedential value and merely decide particular cases on 
the basis of well-settled principles of law imposes needless expense on the public and burdens 9 profession."" Pursuant to that 
rule, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published. "
330,1," In light of our disposition of the prescription claim, we pretermit deciding Acadia's assertion that Industrial has standing to 
assert an anti-tying claim on Surkand's behalf and assume, arguendo, that there is standing. "
331,2," As we noted in City of El Paso, 575 F.2d at 523, Imperial Point, unlike the case at bar, involved damages that could not be 
ascertained at the time of the violation. An anomaly may be Spitz v. Buchwald, 551 F.2d 1051, 1053 (5th Cir. 1977), which, 
relying upon Imperial Point, suggests that limitations are renewed when payments are made. The panel failed to [*6]  address 
the distinction, later made by this court in City of El Paso, between damages that are ascertainable at the time of the initial 
violation and those that are not. "
334,1," Virtual Maintenance, Inc. v. Prime Computer, Inc., 957 F.2d 1318 (6th Cir. 1992), vacated, 113 S. Ct. 314, 121 L. Ed. 2d 
235 (Oct. 13, 1992) (No. 92-90). (""Virtual I"")."
334,2," For a more detailed history of the case, see id. "
335,3," Plaintiffs also claimed that Kodak had unlawfully monopolized and attempted to monopolize the sale of service for Kodak 
machines in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act."
335,4," The Supreme Court made clear that Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 
89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), did not create a special burden on plaintiffs responding to summary judgment challenges in antitrust 
cases, but requires only that the non-moving party's inferences be reasonable and not ""economically senseless."" Eastman 
Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2083. "
336,5," Virtual claimed that a jury could find that Prime possessed almost total control over the Prime 50 Series hardware maintenance 
market.  Virtual I, 957 F.2d at 1330."
336,6," As noted in Virtual I, HN3[
] the elements of a per se tying claim are as follows: ""(1) There must be a tying arrangement 
between two distinct products or services; (2) the seller must have sufficient economic power in the tying market to restrain 
appreciably competition in the tied product market; and (3) the amount of commerce affected must be not insubstantial."" Virtual 
I, 957 F.2d at 1323 (quoting Directory Sales Management v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 833 F.2d 606, 609 (6th Cir. 1982) (other 
quotations omitted))."
336,7," We stated: HN4[
] ""An 11% market share, standing alone, is insufficient as a matter of law to confer the 'great market power, 
evidenced by an exceptional demand for the tying product' necessary for a per se illegal tie."" Virtual I, 957 F.2d at 1325 (quoting 
A.I. Root, 806 F.2d at 676). "
337,8," We observed that this court previously had refused to ignore interbrand competition by limiting the product market to one 
manufacturer's product, citing A.I. Root Co. v. Computer/Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673 (6th Cir. 1986) and Kingsport Motors, 
Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 644 F.2d 566 (6th Cir. 1991). Both of these cases can be distinguished from the instant one. The 
disposition in A.I. Root turned on the fact that the evidence in the case established that equipment using BOSS software had 
""close substitutes."" Id. 806 F.2d at 676. The relevant market was not BOSS software as a unique product market, but small 
business computers.  Id. at 675-76. Thus, the defendant lacked that ""essential characteristic"" of an illegal tying arrangement, the 
seller's ability to coerce customers into buying an unwanted tied product.  Id. at 677. In fact, the plaintiff in that case, rather than 
submitting to the tie, purchased new IBM equipment and software. Id. at 675. Kingsport Motors, 644 F.2d 566, is likewise distinguishable because there the relevant product market, ""properly analyzed,"" 
was ""all medium priced cars available for sale in the United States."" Id. at 571. So defined, there was simply no proof that the 
seller had any power to raise prices or that the tying arrangement at issue affected any appreciable number of buyers within the 
applicable market. Id. Thus, Kingsport Motors, by focusing on the primary equipment market rather than the aftermarket 
cannot compel a similar result in this case. "
338,9," In rejecting Virtual's contention that PDGS constitutes a relevant ""submarket,"" we relied, in part, on the proposition in A.I. Root 
Co. v. Computer/Dynamics, Inc., 806 F.2d 673 (6th Cir. 1986), that ""competitors of [defendant] could produce computer 
hardware and software equivalent to that manufactured by [defendant]. Accordingly, [defendant's product] did not compose a 
separate and distinct submarket within the computer industry as to which we should measure 'market share.'"" Virtual I, 957 F.2d 
at 1327 (quoting A.I. Root, 806 F.2d at 675-76. As previously noted, see supra note 7, A.I. Root rejected the plaintiff's attempts 
to define BOSS as a separate market because although it was copyrighted, there was proof of close substitutes. Id. Closer to 
the mark is a case discussed in A.I. Root, Digidyne Corp. v. Data General, 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984). A.I. Root 
distinguished Digidyne on the basis that the tying product (RDOS), a computer command system, was unique. In contrast, the 
plaintiff in A.I. Root had not presented any evidence that BOSS was particularly unique or desirable. Here, Virtual has offered 
proof of PDGS's desirableness; namely, Ford's requirement that all the design companies with which it does business use the 
software and software updates."
338,10," This view is not inconsistent with dicta in International Logistics, 884 F.2d at 909. There, we stated that Chrysler products 
could not be a relevant market ""absent a government imposed distinctions between Chrysler manufactured replacement parts 
and Chrysler compatible replacement parts . . . ."" Id. By implication, had such a government imposed distinction existed, it may 
have had the ""unique characteristics that would support its consideration as a separate geographic market."" Id. In this case, the 
""imposed distinction"" is Ford's requirement that its automotive design suppliers use the most current version of PDGS marketed 
exclusively through Prime. "
394,1," CPL presented testimony that the City of Fayetteville, North Carolina built a generation plant during this period approximately 
the size that NCEMC would have required. "
395,2," A negotiator for NCEMC, Robert Cleveland, testified that CPL, Virginia Power, and Duke Power all refused from 1974-1976 to 
sell NCEMC a part interest in one of their generation plants unless NCEMC would agree to sell the power generated from the 
joint plant only in those areas of the state where their company controlled the wholesale market. As a result, Cleveland stated 
that NCEMC was precluded from purchasing a joint interest in a single generation plant owned by CPL, Duke Power, or Virginia 
Power, and using that joint interest to generate power for all of its cooperatives throughout North Carolina. Retail cooperatives in 
CPL's areas, thus, were precluded from having NCEMC purchase a part interest in a Duke Power or a Virginia Power plant and 
sell the power from its part interest to them. The strength of the wholesale companies' refusal, however, is questionable given that Duke Power later sold NCEMC the part 
interest in its Catawba plant and allowed NCEMC to sell the wholesale power generated at Catawba throughout North Carolina. 
There was some evidence that Duke Power dropped its requirement that power generated at Catawba only be sold in areas of 
the state where Duke Power controlled the wholesale market when REA, which helped finance NCEMC's purchase of the part 
interest in Catawba, asked Duke Power to drop this requirement."
395,3," There are obvious problems with defining the areas in which CPL sold wholesale power as the relevant market, and the district 
court did not find that NCEMC presented evidence to establish such a market. Because NCEMC's Section 2 claim fails for other 
reasons, however, we need not address this issue. "
396,4," NCEMC asserts that the reason it did not buy a part interest in a Georgia Power plant was that, in order to use the power 
generated at the Georgia Power plant, it needed CPL to supply it with""back-up power"" and CPL could not supply this ""back-up 
power"" at the time it was requested."
396,5," NCEMC asserts that purchasing a part interest in one of Virginia Power's or Duke Power's generation plants and using it to 
produce power in the market at issue here, the market where CPL generated power, was impossible because Virginia Power 
and Duke Power refused to sell NCEMC a part interest in a generation plant that could be used to supply wholesale power in 
areas of North Carolina controlled by CPL. We find this assertion untenable because four years after NCEMC's claim arose, 
Duke Power agreed, without any great fight, to sell NCEMC a part interest in a generation plant that NCEMC could use to 
market wholesale power throughout North Carolina, including in areas controlled by CPL."
396,6," NCEMC also contends that the district court abused its discretion in not admitting a number of its exhibits. We find this 
contention without merit. In addition, we deny NCEMC's motion to strike a portion of CPL's brief. "
417,1, Section 14.12 of the ABA by-laws provided in part: A. The reserve list of a Member Club shall consist of:
417,*," * * (3) Players suspended or declared ineligible, or expelled from the League for violation of the contract between the player 
and the club or for other reasons permitted by the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the League;"
417,*," * * B. A player on a club's reserve list shall not be eligible to contract with any other club unless and until the player is released 
or his contract assigned as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the League. ABA By-laws § 14.12, attached as Ex. 10 to Munchak's 3(g) Statement. "
418,2," Section 14.11 of the ABA by-laws provided in part: Except as otherwise provided in the By-Laws, a player shall be considered a member of a team until the Commissioner 
shall have received notice from that team that the other Member Clubs are free to negotiate with such player. The 
Commissioner shall upon receipt of such notice immediately and simultaneously notify all the other Member Clubs 
accordingly; until such notice is sent, no team shall negotiate with any player who is either under contract or on the reserve 
list of another member team. ABA By-laws § 14.11, attached as Ex. 10 to Munchak's 3(g) Statement. "
423,3," Although Caldwell's contract exempted him from the ABA by-laws, the Spirits and all other member teams of the ABA were 
bound by the by-laws."
423,4," To ""confirm"" that this is the manner in which the ABA by-laws operated, Caldwell cites the deposition testimony of Prentiss 
Yancey and Dave DeBusschere. Yancey was the General Counsel of the ABA Player's Association. DeBusschere was general 
manager of the New York Nets at the time of Caldwell's suspension; he later became Commissioner of the ABA. In his deposition, Yancey stated that he was ""almost certain that [Caldwell's contract] under either the bylaws or a combination of 
bylaws and the contract extended beyond the termination date."" Yancey Dep. at 96. Yancey also stated, not without 
equivocation, that it was his opinion at the time of the events giving rise to this lawsuit that the ABA by-laws applied to Caldwell 
even though they were referenced out of his contract. Id. at 98. Caldwell also cites portions of Dave DeBusschere's Deposition. When asked whether he had any independent recollection of the 
ABA procedures regarding the waiver of players, DeBusschere answered unequivocally ""not really."" DeBusschere Dep. at 55. 
DeBusschere's answers to a long series of questions put to him regarding the ABA by-laws were based on the assumption that 
the by-laws, as described to him by plaintiff's counsel, were the ones in effect during his time as ABA commissioner. See id. at 
52. Specifically, DeBusschere testified that he did not recall whether he did or did not ever receive notice when he was general 
manager of the Nets that Caldwell was a free agent. Id. at 71-72. "
424,5," The defendants contend that Caldwell was terminated shortly after he was suspended, and therefore even if he had been 
placed on the Spirits' reserve list, he would have been removed at that time. The parties dispute whether this issue is res 
judicata based on the district court's finding in the Georgia action. We need not address this issue since we take the facts in the 
light most favorable to the plaintiff and assume that Caldwell was never terminated."
424,6," Caldwell's charge that an antitrust conspiracy prevented him from playing major league professional basketball in 1975 and 
thereafter is further belied by the terms of the settlement of American Basketball Ass'n Players Ass'n v. National Basketball 
Ass'n, 72 F.R.D. 594, 596 (S.D.N.Y. 1976). The settlement provided that all former ABA players not employed on the expansion 
teams -- i.e., the ABA teams that joined the NBA -- and not selected in the NBA draft of players from the two excluded ABA 
teams were free agents and could seek to compete for placement on team rosters in the NBA as of July 26, 1976. Id. 
Accordingly, Caldwell could not have been on the Spirits' reserve list after the execution of the Robertson settlement."
424,7," As noted above, Caldwell argues that ""the enforcement of the ABA By-Law under which Caldwell was placed and remained 
forever on the Spirits' reserve list is sufficient by itself to satisfy Section 1's requirement of concerted action."" Pl.'s Mem. at 32-33 
(emphasis supplied). Nowhere in these protracted proceedings has Caldwell attempted to limit his boycott claim to a specific 
period of time shorter than ""forever."" Specifically, Caldwell does not claim that placement of him on the Spirits' reserve list for the 
period remaining under his contract violates the Sherman Act. Defendants pointed this out to the Court in its moving papers, see 
Spirits Defs.' Reply at 19-20, and again at oral argument, see Transcript of Proceedings, March 11, 1993, at 16. Caldwell never 
informed the Court that he was in fact making such a claim. If Caldwell were making such a claim, he would face the formidable task of demonstrating to the satisfaction of a jury that the 
operation of these by-laws violated § 1 under a Rule of Reason analysis. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Indiana Federation of 
Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-59, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986) (""per se approach has generally been limited to cases 
in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing business with a "
425,," competitor""); North America Soccer League, 670 F.2d at 1259 (""Because agreements between members of a joint venture can 
under some circumstances have legitimate purposes as well as anticompetitive effects, they are subject to scrutiny under a rule 
of reason.""); see also Molinas v. National Basketball Ass'n, 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1961). We also note that if Caldwell 
were claiming that his placement on the Spirits' reserve list until the expiration of his contract violated the Sherman Act, any 
recovery would be off-set by the amount he collected in the Georgia action."
425,8," Caldwell claims that at this time DeBusschere was Commissioner of the ABA. However the newspaper article which Caldwell 
relies on describes DeBusschere as the general manager of the New York Nets. See also Pl.s' Mem at 12 (DeBusschere was "
426,," General Manager of the Nets during the period from Caldwell's suspension until the summer of 1975). Apparently, this 
discrepancy was the result of an error on Eger's part. See Eger Aff. P 6 (DeBusschere incorrectly identified in article as general 
manager of Nets). "
427,9," Furthermore, Caldwell's postulated motives can only be described as speculative. For example, Caldwell's claim that the 
Spirits could not afford to pay Caldwell's salary is not supported by any evidence in the record. Moreover, even if the Spirits were 
motivated to suspend Caldwell to avoid paying his salary, it does not follow that the Spirits were motivated to enter into an illegal 
agreement to boycott Caldwell from playing baseball for other teams for the remainder of his career."
427,10," Rule 803(24) provides: HN14[
] Other exceptions. A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent 
circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a 
material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the 
proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rule and the interests of justice "
428,," will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this 
exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to 
provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and 
the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant. Fed. R. Evid. 803(24). "
429,11," Although we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that there was concerted 
action on the part of any of the defendants to boycott Caldwell, we write separately with regard to defendant Munchak to address 
the issues raised in Munchak's motion and to emphasize the dearth of evidence supporting Caldwell's § 1 claim. "
430,12," In his complaint, Caldwell defines the relevant market as ""producing, staging and performing professional basketball in the 
United States."" Complaint P 12. "
431,13," Obviously, the Spirits' share of the relevant market is significantly less than 36% since the Spirits were merely one member 
team of the ABA. "
432,14," Of course, in Part I of this Opinion we concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants conspired to 
boycott Caldwell in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. "
433,15," It would appear that plaintiff's failure to plead special damages would also provide alternative grounds for dismissing 
Caldwell's intentional tort claim. See Chen, 854 F.2d at 627 (noting that special damages is an element of prima facie tort and 
intentional tort). "
437,1," In 1988, Nabisco priced its Shredded Wheat products at 93% of the industry average. By 1992, the per pound price of $ 3.13 
was 106% of the industry average. Hrg. Tr. at 97."
437,2," As of April 1, 1992, the market share of Spoon Size Shredded Wheat and Big Biscuit Shredded Wheat was 1.1% and 0.7%, 
respectively. Thomas Aff. P 2. "
440,3," A court should not order rescission unless the seller's return to the industry is feasible under the circumstances and the 
remedy is the most effective way to cure the antitrust violation. See generally, Earl W. Kintner, 5 Federal Antitrust Law, § 40.8 
at 121, § 40.14 at 156-57 (1984 & Supp. 1993)."
440,4," A court may be reluctant to order this latter relief, given that Nabisco continues to use the Nabisco name and trademark to sell 
over $ 3 billion worth of cookies and crackers each year. Thomas Aff. P 4; Hrg. Tr. at 246."
440,5," As the Business Director for Nabisco's RTE cereal business put it, Post is ""in the long run, a better brand umbrella for RTE 
cereal products than 'Nabisco,' which most consumers identify primarily with cookies and crackers."" Thomas Aff. P 7. The State 
concedes that Kraft will maintain the high quality of Shredded Wheat. Further, since acquiring Nabisco's RTE cereal assets, 
Kraft has increased marketing above Nabisco's low levels, and lowered the price of Shredded Wheat relative to competitive 
cereals. Hrg. Tr. at 72-73, 76, 101. Thus, association with Post may enhance the value of the former Nabisco cereals. The State argues that courts have upheld trademark infringement claims where the infringer has a stronger reputation than the 
trademark holder, despite the ""apparent lack of injury to [the trademark holder's] reputation,"" Banff, Ltd. v. Federated Dep't 
Stores, Inc., 841 F.2d 486, 492 (2d Cir. 1988). The State's reliance on trademark infringement cases involving competing 
products is unavailing here. Sampson June 10, 1993 Letter at 3-7. Banff is distinguishable because the concerns of trademark 
law are avoiding confusion as to the source of the goods in question and preserving fair competition. Here, there are no 
competing goods at issue. The sole question is whether the addition of the Post name on products manufactured by Kraft will 
cause Shredded Wheat consumers nationwide not to buy the hypothetical new entrant's products because the Nabisco name 
appears on the box with the Post name for several months in a few test markets. "
441,6," The Court notes that the association with Kraft already exists on the cereal boxes by operation of law, in small type, and that 
the addition of the Post logo simply heightens the likelihood of a consumer becoming aware of that association. May 18, 1993 
Tr. at 5-6. "

450,6," The standing requirement similarly has been applied to treble-damage actions under RICO. See, e.g., Holmes v. Securities 
Investor Protection Corp., 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311 (1992); Illinois v. Life of Mid-America Ins. Co., 805 F.2d 763 (7th 
Cir. 1986)."
450,7," HN8[
] ""Standing"" may be broadly construed to involve all the elements of the cause of action. That is, a plaintiff may not 
have ""standing"" unless he can satisfy each requirement of the § 4 action--antitrust violation, antitrust injury and proximate cause. 
There is some logic to this interpretation, for as we shall discuss, infra, ""standing"" limits access to the cause of action to those "
451,," properly suited to vindicate the violation. A person cannot be the most effective plaintiff if he cannot satisfy all of the elements of 
§ 4. For purposes of clarity and in accord with what seems to be the approach of this circuit, see Local Beauty Supply, 787 F.2d 
at 1201; In re Indus. Gas Antitrust Litig. (Bicahn), 681 F.2d 514, 519-20 (7th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1016 (1983), and 
of the commentators, see, e.g., Page, supra, at 1484-85, we prefer, however, to treat antitrust injury and standing separately. 
We will, therefore, refer to standing only when discussing the element of proximate cause. Of course, this is merely a matter of 
semantics and the essential elements of the § 4 action remain the same under either approach. "
452,8," Chevron also held an ownership interest in an ethanol production plant at the time it was allegedly conspiring against the sale 
of gasohol. "
453,9," The Gasohol Competition Act of 1980 provides in full: HN17[
] (a) Limitations on the use of credit instruments, sales, resales, and transfers Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course 
of such commerce, directly or indirectly to impose any condition, restriction, agreement, or understanding that-- (1) limits the use of credit instruments in any transaction concerning the sale, resale, or transfer of gasohol or other 
synthetic motor fuel of equivalent usability in any case in which there is no similar limitation on transactions concerning 
such person's conventional motor fuel; or (2) otherwise unreasonably discriminates against or unreasonably limits the sale, resale, or transfer of gasohol or 
other synthetic motor fuel of equivalent usability in any case in which such synthetic or conventional motor fuel is sold 
for use, consumption, or resale within the United States. (b) Credit fees; equivalent conventional motor fuel sales; labeling of pumps; product liability disclaimers; 
advertising support; furnishing facilities (1) Nothing in this section or in any other provision of law in effect on December 2, 1980, which is specifically applicable to 
the sale of petroleum products shall preclude any person referred to in subsection (a) of this section from imposing a 
reasonable fee for credit on the sale, resale, or transfer of the gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel referred to in subsection 
(a) of this section if such fee equals no more than the actual costs to such person of extending that credit. (2) The prohibitions in this section shall not apply to any person who makes available sufficient supplies of gasohol and 
other synthetic motor fuels of equivalent usability to satisfy his customers' needs for such products, if the gasohol and other 
synthetic fuels are made available on terms and conditions which are equivalent to the terms and conditions on which such 
person's conventional motor fuel products are made available. (3) Nothing in this section shall-- (A) preclude any person referred to in subsection (a) of this section from requiring reasonable labeling of pumps 
dispensing the gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel referred to in subsection (a) of this section to indicate, as 
appropriate, that such gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel is not manufactured, distributed, or sold by such person; (B) preclude such person from issuing appropriate disclaimers of product liability for damage resulting from use of the 
gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel; (C) require such person to provide advertising support for the gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel; or (D) require such person to furnish or provide, at such person's own expense, any additional pumps, tanks, or other 
related facilities required for the sale of the gasohol or other synthetic motor fuel. (c) Definition As used in this section, ""United States"" includes the several States, the District of Columbia, any territory of the United 
States and any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States. "
454,10," As we discuss, infra, a number of states have enacted laws requiring dealers to post ""gasohol"" or ""contains alcohol"" labels on 
their gasohol pumps. "
455,11," This comports with the approach taken by courts in defining antitrust injury for § 4 suits predicated upon a violation of the 
Robinson-Patman Act. These courts have recognized that the interests Congress sought to protect in enacting the Sherman Act 
and the Robinson-Patman Act ""do not mirror one another,"" J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1540 n.17 
(3d Cir. 1990); see also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 450-51, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854, 98 S. Ct. 2864 
(1978) (noting distinction and potential tension between Sherman Act and RobinsonPatman Act). Thus, courts have relied on the 
purposes of the Robinson-Patman Act to determine whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the antitrust injury requirement for a 
Robinson-Patman violation. See, e.g., J.F. Feeser, 909 F.2d at 1533-35, 1539-41 & n.17 (secondary-line plaintiff need only show 
injury to competitor to satisfy competitive injury requirement, and correspondingly, the antitrust injury requirement; injury to 
consumers unnecessary); Alan's of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6, 1426-28 (11th Cir. 1990) (same); 
Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that ""in order for a plaintiff to prove competitive injury 
under Robinson-Patman, he need only show that a substantial price discrimination existed as between himself and his 
competitors over a period of time.""), aff'd on other grounds, 496 U.S. 543, 110 L. Ed. 2d 492, 110 S. Ct. 2535 (1990); Areeda & 
Hovencamp, supra, P 340.5 (citing with approval finding of antitrust injury in favor of injured competitor in Hasbrouck). Indeed, 
even the courts which have held the interpretation of ""competitive injury"" under the Robinson-Patman Act to be analogous to that 
applied under the Sherman Act have done so by reviewing the intent and legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act, 
concluding only then that the two acts have similar purposes. See, e.g., Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 267 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 
837 F.2d 1127, 1138-39, 1143-48 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (reviewing purpose of Robinson-Patman Act and concluding that, as in the 
case of the Sherman Act, absence of consumer injury is evidence in rebuttal of showing of competitive injury). "
456,12," Although these purposes may transcend to a degree the accustomed, consumer-oriented purposes of the ""antitrust"" laws, we 
do not think that Congress's concern for fostering new products and new competitors in this context in any way marks the 
Gasohol Act as something other than an antitrust law, or the injury resulting from its violation as something other than an 
antitrust injury."
456,13," The mere showing that gasohol blenders and ethanol manufacturers and sellers may suffer the type of injury protected against 
by the Gasohol Act does not mean that these categories of interests necessarily have standing to sue for a violation of the Act. 
As noted, antitrust injury and antitrust standing involve two separate inquiries. The crux of the standing analysis is whether the 
plaintiff is the proper party to vindicate the antitrust interest. "
457,14," In ascertaining the amount of damages, the plaintiff nonetheless must be able to trace its damages to the injury which was in 
fact caused by the violation.  MCI, 708 F.2d at 1168."
457,15," The record contains owner's manuals from the 1991 Honda Accord, 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse, 1986 Nissan Stanza Wagon, 
1986 Porsche Audi, 1984 Saab 900, 1986 Subaru, 1984 Toyota Tercel, 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit, 1987 AMC, 1989 Eagle 
Summit, 1989 Dodge Ram, 1985 Ford Tempo, 1984 Buick Regal, 1986 Buick Riviera and 1986 Chevrolet. "
458,16," The states exempting gasohol in whole or in part from state fuel taxes in 1985 were Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Of these, only Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, 
Washington and Wyoming have not since eliminated or reduced the exemption. Only Missouri and South Carolina have begun 
to exempt gasohol since 1985 without any subsequent reduction or elimination of the exemption."
458,17," Three other plaintiffs--Wurster, Cajun Energy and Public Terminals--were Louisiana-based wholesale marketers of ethanol 
and gasohol. "
459,18," In 1985, eight grain-based ethanol producers controlled approximately 90 percent of all ethanol production in the United 
States. "
461,1," This Court notes that there is no motion before the Court to compel compliance with this Court's previous order enjoining 
Defendant Penco from violating the franchise agreement. This Court rules only on those motions properly before it."
461,2," During oral argument, this Court inquired into exactly hat couponing could amount to and a franchisee's freedom to engage in 
such activity. Plaintiff's counsel was unable to answer authoritatively and has submitted the affidavit of Rhoda Olsen in this 
regard. Defendants object to this affidavit as an untimely brief. Defendants are in error. "
462,3, These restrictions are still in place and are unaffected by this Court's instant ruling.
462,4," However, this Court finds that Defendants have a colorable argument and for this reason this Court declines to award Plaintiff 
attorneys fees."
462,5," Defendants argument that no conflicts with consumer protection laws have thus far developed is spurious. The law is the law. 
Not having been found to have broken any laws, yet, is not synonymous with adhering to the law. This Court will not endorse a 
catch-me-if-you-can theory of legal reasoning."
462,6, The 84 days of free discounting could not be consecutive. The discounting is limited to 21 days in any three month period. 
476,1," Jurisdiction is premised on the following: 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 15, 26; 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 1331, 1337; and the doctrine of supplemental 
jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367."
476,2," The term ""overbuilder"" refers to a cable television operator who enters an area already served by an existing local cable 
operator and who must build over the operations of the incumbent franchisee. "
477,3," This market is also referred to as the ""retail cable sales market"" or the ""multi-channel video services market."""
477,4," Montgomery Cablevision alleges that both Turner Cable Network Sales and Turner Network are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 
Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc., which is engaged in the business of producing and distributing cable television 
programming."
477,5," Montgomery Cablevision also alleges that Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the United States, 
and Satellite Services, a cable television program distributor, are vertically integrated with Storer Cable or otherwise financially 
or managerially related to it."
477,6," Montgomery Cablevision also alleges that its franchise from the City of Montgomery requires it to build over 200 miles per year 
over a five-year period with penalties of $ 250,000 per year for failure to meet that goal. The denial of the Turner Network 
program service and ESPN's football package jeopardizes its ability to meet its franchise requirements. "
479,7," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN5[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."""
479,8," To invoke the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act, a claimant must show ""(1) that the local activity has a (2) substantial effect on (3) 
interstate commerce."" El Shahawy v. Harrison, 778 F.2d 636, 639 (11th Cir. 1985). Because ""the antitrust laws are concerned 
primarily with the integrity of interstate markets,"" the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals requires that a determination of Sherman 
Act Jurisdiction ""focus on the interstate markets involved in the defendant's business activities."" Id. at 640 (citation omitted). In 
this case, Montgomery Cablevision has sufficiently alleged that the counterclaim defendants are substantially involved in 
interstate commerce to meet the jurisdictional requirement of the Sherman Act. See id. at 641. "
480,9," Examples of per se prohibited combinations are price fixing, group boycotts, and market division agreements. Copperweld 
Corp., 467 U.S. at 768, 104 S. Ct. at 2740."
480,10," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted 
as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 
1981. "
481,11," Generally, interbrand competition is defined as competition among suppliers or manufacturers of the same generic product, 
while intrabrand competition is the competition between distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular supplier 
or manufacturer. Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 52 n.19, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n.19. In the cable industry, interbrand competition 
would include competition among program suppliers, while intrabrand competition would occur among cable television 
operators."
481,12," See also L.A. Draper & Son, 735 F.2d at 423 (the product dimension is determined by ""the availability of substitutes to which 
consumers can turn in response to price increases and other existing or potential producer's ability to expand output""). "
482,13," The counterclaim defendants have raised no real dispute that the relevant market at the intrabrand level of competition in this 
case is the retail cable television sales market in the Montgomery area. HN16[
] -"
482,14," Market power has also been defined as the power ""to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive 
market."" Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 14, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1559, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). Market 
power, however, differs from monopoly power. The former requires less market influence. Eastman Kodak,    U.S. at   , 112 S. 
Ct. at 2090."
482,15," Product differentiation may be based on styling, packaging, advertising, service and other non-price competition. See Graphic 
Prod. Distrib., 717 F.2d at 1570 n.15. "
483,16," This court therefore disagrees with the comment in Futurevision Cable Systems of Wiggins, Inc. v. Multivision Cable TV 
Corp., 789 F. Supp. 760, 768 (S.D. Miss. 1992), aff'd, 986 F.2d 1418 (5th Cir. 1993) (Table), that a complainant ""must allege 
anti-competitive effect at the interbrand level of competition"" to establish § 1 Sherman Act violation. "
484,17," The Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Eastman Kodak does not undermine, and indeed could be said to support, this 
economic approach. There, the court was similarly confronted with the economic relationship between a ""primary"" market and a 
""derivative"" market or ""aftermarket,"" albeit within the context of an alleged tying arrangement.    U.S. at   , 112 S. Ct. at 2076. 
The primary market was for a company's equipment and the aftermarkets were for that company's services and parts. The Court 
stated a economic truth equally applicable here, that ""The extent to which one market prevents exploitation of another market 
depends on the extent to which consumers will change their consumption of one product in response to a price change in 
another, i.e., 'cross-elasticity of demand.'"" Id. at    , 112 S. Ct. at 2083. The court observed that ""there is no immutable physical 
law -- no 'basic economic reality' -- insisting that competition in the equipment market cannot coexist with market power in the 
aftermarkets."" Id. at    , 112 S. Ct. at 2084. The court then concluded, after engaging in a complex economic analysis, that there 
could conceivably be an impermissible restraint on trade in the aftermarket even in the absence of market power in the primary 
market. In reaching this conclusion, the Court admonished courts to rely on ""actual market realities"" rather than ""legal 
presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctions."" Id. at    , 112 S. Ct. at 2082."
484,18," Although the counterclaim alleges that several of the counterclaim defendants ""contracted, combined or acted alone"" to 
refuse to sell the Turner Network program service to Montgomery Cablevision, Montgomery Cablevision does not intend to 
pursue a § 1 claim against any unilateral behavior. Nor does it intend to pursue a group boycott theory at this time. "
485,19," The rights to televise Sunday night NFL games are divided between Turner Network and ESPN. Each telecasts 8 games per 
season."
485,20," These major television events include telecasts of certain NBA playoffs games and MGM movies that are carried exclusively 
on the Turner Network. "
486,21," The Court also noted: ""Numerous representatives of the broadcasting, motion picture and advertising industries testified to the general effect that 
a 'particular and special demand exists among radio broadcasting and telecasting [and motion picture] companies for the 
rights to broadcast and telecast [and make and distribute films of] championship contests in contradistinction to similar 
rights to non-championship contests."""
486,358," U.S. at 251, 79 S. Ct. at 250. "
487,22," See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. at 15, 104 S. Ct. at 1559-60."
487,23," In its brief in opposition to the motions to dismiss, Montgomery Cablevision also points out that the nature of the cable 
television industry, with its high channel capacity, is to reach a broad spectrum of targeted, specialized audiences through 
targeted, specialized programming. Consequently, there are numerous narrow programming submarkets that have ""peculiar 
characteristics and uses,"" ""distinct customers,"" and ""specialized vendors."" See Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 325, 82 S. Ct. at 
1524."
487,24," The cases cited by the counterclaim defendants to support their contention that the appropriate market for cable television 
services is the broader market of passive visual entertainment are not to the contrary. In those cases, the appropriate market for 
antitrust purposes was determined only after extensive fact-finding had been conducted. For example, in Cable Holdings of 
Georgia, Inc. v. Home Video, Inc., 825 F.2d 1559 (11th Cir. 1987), a jury, at the end of a trial, determined that the appropriate 
market for cable television services was passive visual entertainment, which included cable television, satellite television, video 
cassette recordings, and free over-the-air television. The appellate court upheld this finding as ""not clearly erroneous."" Id. at 
1563. Similarly, in Satellite Television & Associated Resources, Inc. v. Continental Cablevision of Virginia, Inc., 714 F.2d 351 
(4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1027, 104 S. Ct. 1285, 79 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1984), a district court defined the relevant market 
in ruling on a motion for summary Judgment. The court concluded that the provision of cable television services in that particular 
case was part of the broader market of ""cinema, broadcast television, video disks and cassettes, and other types of leisure and 
entertainment-related businesses."" Id. at 355. This determination, however, was reached only after the parties stipulated that 
customers perceived cable television services to be ""reasonably interchangeable"" with the offerings of movie theaters and that 
the cable companies were in competition with the wide variety of entertainment services enumerated above."
487,25," As the Court explained: ""It inexorably follows that if college football broadcasts be defined as a separate market -- and we are convinced they are -- 
then the NCAA's complete control over those broadcasts provides a solid basis for the District Court's conclusion that the 
NCAA possesses market power with respect to those broadcasts."" NCAA v. Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 112, 104 S. Ct. at 2966. "
488,26," This case therefore differs markedly from Futurevision Cable Systems of Wiggins, Inc. v. Multivision Cable TV Corp., 789 F. 
Supp. 760 (S.D. Miss. 1992), aff'd, 986 F.2d 1418 (5th Cir. 1993) (Table). There, the court dismissed a complaint brought by a 
new cable television company alleging that exclusive dealing arrangements between cable television programmers and an 
existing cable television operator violated the antitrust laws. However, no allegations were made regarding the market power of 
the programmers to foreclose market alternatives.  Id. at 766-75. Moreover, comparable and competitive alternative 
programming appears to have been available. Id. at 769-70. It is also noteworthy, that in reaching its conclusions, the court in 
Futurevision did not consider the issue of submarkets nor product differentiation."
488,27," This market is alternatively referred to as the market for ""multi-channel video services."""
488,28," This litigation, therefore differs from Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 770, where the district court dismissed an anti-trust claim 
because of an absence of allegations that competition in provision of cable television services was adversely affected by 
exclusive contracts among programmers and incumbent franchisee."
488,29," Contrast with Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 769, where the court found that interbrand competition acted as a check on the 
exploitation of intrabrand market power and that the effect of exclusive licenses on intrabrand competition was ""insignificant."" "
489,30," The elimination of Montgomery Cablevision as a competitor to Storer Cable would alone not constitute a violation of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. But when considered in conjunction with the overall effects on the intrabrand and interbrand markets, the 
elimination of Montgomery Cablevision as a provider of retail cable television services could be the basis of an antitrust injury."
489,31," Contrast with Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 778 (exclusive contracts had pro-competitive effects on interbrand competition 
because comparable alternative programming was available). "
490,32," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN29[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony."""
490,15, U.S.C.A. § 2. 
492,33," Contrast with Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 777 and Northeastern Educ. Television of Ohio, Inc. v. Educ. Television Ass'n, 
758 F. Supp. 1568, 1579 (N.D. Ohio 1990), where claims of conspiracy to monopolize were dismissed because of the failure to 
allege that the defendants possessed sufficient market power to assist in establishing a monopoly in the relevant market."
492,34," Contrast with Syufy Enter. v. Am. Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 1000-1001 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1031, 
107 S. Ct. 876, 93 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1987) and Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 777-78. In Syufy, the court of appeals found there was 
no conspiracy to monopolize where there was no evidence indicating that certain film distributors, who were alleged co-
conspirators, knew or should have known that their licensee intended to exploit its exclusive film licensing rights for its own 
monopolistic purposes. Similarly, in Futurevision, the district court dismissed a claim for conspiracy to monopolize where there 
were no allegations that cable television programmers knew or should have known that certain cable television operators were 
using their exclusive rights to monopolize the cable services markets nor any facts to support such an inference. In this case, in 
contrast, there are specific allegations concerning the knowledge of the counterclaim defendants regarding Storer Cable's 
intentions to monopolize the retail cable sales market in Montgomery and facts to support these contentions. "
493,35," Contrast with Futurevision, 789 F. Supp. at 778, where complaint failed to allege that there were no valid business reasons for 
cable programmers to refuse to supply programming to a new cable franchise."
493,36," The counterclaim defendants also point to TV Communications Network, Inc. v. Turner Network Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 
1022 (10th Cir. 1992), to support their contention that the program suppliers and distributors in this case had no rational 
economic motive to aid Storer Cable in its efforts to achieve a monopoly over the retail cable sales market. However, that case is 
inapposite. There, the court was faced with allegations that cable television operators had conspired with program suppliers to 
aid the program suppliers in maintaining their monopolies over the cable programming market. The court concluded that the 
cable operators would have no rational motive to create such an environment. In this case, in contrast, Montgomery Cablevision 
has alleged that the program suppliers conspired with a cable television operator, Storer Cable, to aid the cable operator in its 
efforts to monopolize the retail cable sales market. "
494,37," Because the court finds that Montgomery Cablevision has adequately stated a cause of action under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 
the court need not address whether the ""essential facilities"" doctrine also provides a basis for a § 2 claim in this case. See, e.g., 
McKenzie v. Mercy Hosp., 854 F.2d 365, 369 (10th Cir. 1988)."
494,38," Section 6-5-60 provides in pertinent part: HN34[
] ""Any person, firm or corporation injured or damaged by an unlawful trust, combine or monopoly, or its effect, 
direct or indirect, may, in each instance of such injury or damage, recover the sum of $ 500.00 and all actual damages from 
any person, firm or corporation creating, operating, aiding or abetting such trust, combine or monopoly."""
494,39," Montgomery Cablevision alleges that the counterclaim defendants have monopolized or attempted to monopolize the cable 
programming market in violation of state common law, in addition to monopolizing the cable television services market. 
However, monopolization of the cable programming market is not alleged in the § 2 Sherman Act claim against the counterclaim 
defendants. Nor has Montgomery Cablevision presented any facts to support such a claim. The court thus concludes that 
although Montgomery Cablevision has sufficiently alleged a claim to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the cable television 
services market, it has not stated a claim to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the cable programming market. "
495,40," Section 3 of Ordinance 48-90 provides: HN37[
] ""It shall be unlawful for a cable television exhibitor providing or intending to provide cable service within the City 
to restrain, or attempt to restrain the freedom of trade or production, or to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize the 
production, control or sale of program material or program services used in the provision of cable television service within 
the City. ""It shall be unlawful for a cable television distributor or cable television program supplier to restrain, or attempt to restrain 
the freedom of trade or production, or to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize the production, control or sale of program 
material or program services used in the provision of cable television service within the City."""
495,41," Section 4 of Ordinance 48-90 provides in pertinent part: HN38[
] ""It shall be unlawful for a cable television exhibitor providing or intending to provide cable television service within 
the City to contract or combine with any other person to fix or limit the lease, license, sale or exchange . . . of program 
material or program services used in the provision of cable television service where the purpose or effect of such contract 
[or] combination is or may be to tend to create a monopoly or to injure, destroy, inhibit, prevent or lessen substantially 
competition with respect to the provision of cable television service within the City."""
495,42," Because the court finds that Montgomery Cablevision has stated claims under §§ 1 & 2 of the Sherman Act, the court need 
not reach the question whether a particular set of facts could give rise to a valid cause of action under Ordinance 48-90 but not 
fall under the federal antitrust laws. "
496,43," In the past, the Alabama Supreme Court has listed absence of justification for the defendant's interference as one of the 
elements of the plaintiff's cause of action. See, e.g., Caine v. Am. Life Assurance Corp., 554 So. 2d 962, 964 (Ala. 1989); 
Lowder Realty, Inc. v. Odom, 495 So. 2d 23, 25 (Ala. 1986); Gross v. Lowder Realty, 494 So. 2d at 597. However, in Century 21 
Academy Realty, Inc. v. Breland, 571 So. 2d 296 (Ala. 1990), the court recognized that it was illogical to continue to list absence 
of justification as one of the elements of the plaintiff's cause of action and then to place the burden on the defendant to disprove 
it. The court, therefore, eliminated absence of justification from the elements and held that justification is an affirmative defense 
that must be pleaded and proved by the defendant.  Id. at 297-98. See also Underwood v. S. Cent. Bell Tel. Co., 590 So. 2d 
170, 176 n.4 (Ala. 1991). "

516,1," Because the parties in this case agree that the relevant measure of cost is average variable cost, however, we again decline to 
resolve the conflict among the lower courts over the appropriate measure of cost. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 
479 U.S. 104, 117-118, n. 12, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986); Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475

521,2," This statement could well have referred to the rate at which the segment was growing relative to prior years' generic volume; 
this ""internal"" rate of growth would inevitably slow as the base volume against which it was measured grew. "
525,1," ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or 
with customers of either of them . . . ."" 15 U.S. C. § 13(a)."
525,2," The jury gave an affirmative answer to the following special issue: ""1. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination that had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the 
cigarette market as a whole in the United States?"" App. 27. The jury made its finding after being instructed that ""injury to competition"" means ""the injury to consumer welfare which results 
when a competitor is able to raise and to maintain prices in a market or well-defined submarket above competitive levels. In 
order to injure competition in the cigarette market as a whole, Brown & Williamson must be able to create a real possibility of 
both driving out rivals by loss-creating price cutting and then holding on to that advantage to recoup losses by raising and 
maintaining prices at higher than competitive levels. ""You must remember that the Robinson-Patman Act was designed to protect competition rather than just competitors and, 
therefore, injury to competition does not mean injury to a competitor. Liggett & Myers can not satisfy this element simply by 
showing that they were injured by Brown & Williamson's conduct. To satisfy this element, Liggett & Myers must show, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that Brown & Williamson's conduct had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the 
cigarette market and not just a reasonable possibility of injuring a competitor in the cigarette market."" Id., at 829-830."
525,3," As the majority notes, the procedural posture of this case requires that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Liggett. Ante, at 213. On review of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the party against whom the judgment is entered ""must 
be given the benefit of every legitimate inference that can be drawn from the evidence."" See C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 2528, pp. 563-564 (1971). "
526,4," When the Court states that ""substantial evidence suggests that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices 
above a competitive level,"" ante, at 213, I assume it accepts the proposition that a reasonable jury could find abnormally high 
prices characteristic of this industry."
526,5," An internal B&W memorandum, dated May 15, 1984, states in part: ""Manufacturer's price increases generally were below the rate of inflation but margins improved handsomely due to favorable 
leaf prices and cost reductions associated with automation. For example, Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased from 
$ 2.91/M in 1972 to $ 8.78/M in 1981, an increase of over 200%. In 1982, the industry became much more aggressive on the 
pricing front, fueled by a 100% increase in the Federal Excise Tax. Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased from $ 
10.78/M in 1982 and [sic] to $ 12.61/M in 1983. ""The impact of these pricing activities on the smoking public was dramatic. The weighted average retail price of a pack of 
cigarettes increased 56% between 1980 and 1983 (from $ .63 to $ .98)."" App. 127. "
527,6," On June 4, 1984, B&W announced a maximum rebate of $ 0.30 per carton for purchases of over 8,000 cases per quarter; a 
week later, Liggett announced a rebate of $ 0.20 on comparable volumes. On June 21, B&W increased its rebate to $ 0.50, and 
a day later, Liggett went to $ 0.43. After three more increases, B&W settled at $ 0.80 per carton, while Liggett remained at $ 
0.73. See App. 327, 420-421."
527,7," That quantity discounts are covered by the Act, and prohibited when they have the requisite effect on competition, has been 
firmly established since our decision in FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 42-44, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948)."
527,8," ""Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of 
manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such 
purchasers sold or delivered."" § 13(a)."
527,9," ""Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing 
that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an 
equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor."" § 13(b). The jury gave a negative answer to the following special issue: ""3. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination in good faith with the intention to meet, but not beat, the equally low 
net prices of Liggett Group, Inc.?"" App. 27-28."
527,10," By offering its largest discounts to Liggett's 14 largest customers, App. 168-169, 174, B&W not only put its ""money where the 
volume is,"" id., at 402, but also applied maximum pressure to Liggett at a lesser cost to itself than would have resulted from a 
nondiscriminatory price cut. "
528,11," It is also true that these same years, other major manufacturers entered the generic market and expanded their generic sales. 
Ante, at 217. Their entry is entirely consistent with the possibility that lockstep increases in the price of generics brought them to 
a level that was supra-competitive, through lower than that charged on branded cigarettes."
528,12," ""Q Does this mean that the price increases, which you testified are happening twice a year, are used up in these consumer 
promotions? ""A Not by any stretch of the imagination. Although there has been an increase in the use of this type of promotional activity over 
the last four or five years, the increase in that promotional activity has been far outstripped by the list price increases. The prices 
go up by a lot; the promotional activity, indeed, does go up. But the promotional activity has not gone up by anywhere near the 
magnitude of the list price increases. Further, those price increases are not warranted by increasing costs, since the 
manufacturing costs of making cigarettes have remained roughly constant over the last five years."" App. 509. "
529,13," See text of statute, n. 1, supra."
529,14," One of the purposes of broadening the Clayton Act's competitive injury language in the Robinson-Patman Act was to provide 
more effective protection against predatory price cutting. As the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust 
Laws explained in its 1955 report: ""In some circumstances, to be sure, injury to even a single competitor should bring the Act into play. Predatory price cutting 
designed to eliminate a smaller business rival, for example, is a practice which inevitably frustrates competition by excluding 
competitors from the market or deliberately impairing their competitive strength. The invalidation of such deliberate price slashes 
for the purpose of destroying even a single competitor, moreover, accords distinct recognition to the narrower tests of 'injury' 
added to the price discrimination provisions of the Clayton Act through the 1936 Robinson-Patman amendments. The 
discrimination provisions in the original Clayton Act were feared by the legislators as inadequate to check the victimization of 
individual businessmen by predatory price cuts that nevertheless created no general impairment of competitive conditions in a 
wider market. To reach such destructive price cuts endangering the survival of smaller rivals of a powerful seller was an express 
objective of the liberalizing amendments in the 'injury' clause of the Robinson-Patman Act."" Report of the Attorney General's 
National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 165-166 (1955) (footnotes omitted). "
531,15," In finding an absence of actual supracompetitive pricing, the Court also relies on the testimony of Liggett executives, who 
stated that industry prices were fair. Illustrative is the following exchange: ""Q I want to know -- yes or no -- sir, whether or not you say that the price you charged for branded cigarettes, which is the same 
price you say everybody else charged, was a fair and equitable price for that product to the American consumer. ""A It's what the industry set, and based on that it's a fair price."" App. 396. The problem with this testimony, and testimony like it, is that it relates to the period before the price war, as well as after, see id., 
at 392, when there is no real dispute but that prices were supracompetitive. (""The profits in the cigarette industry are the best of 
any industry I've been associated with, very much so."" Ibid.) Some of the testimony cited by the Court, for instance, is that of an 
outside director who served only from 1977 or 1978 until 1980, see 64 Tr. 51-56, cited ante, at 237; his belief in the 
competitiveness of his industry must be viewed against the ""substantial evidence suggesting that in recent decades, the industry 
reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level"" to which the majority itself refers, ante, at 213. The jury was, of course, entitled to discount the probative force of testimony from executives to the effect that there was no 
collusion among tobacco manufacturers, App. 397-398, and that they had appeared before a congressional committee to vouch 
for the competitive nature of their industry, id., at 623-631. The jury was also free to give greater weight to the documentary 
evidence presented, the inferences to be drawn there-from, and the testimony of experts who agreed with the textbook 
characterization of the industry. See App. 640-645; R. Tennant, American Cigarette Industry 342 (1950)."

Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 118, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986), we recognized that price cutting of a predatory

544,1," CGL insurance provides ""coverage for third party casualty damage claims against a purchaser of insurance (the 'insured')."" 
App. 8 (Cal. Complaint P4.a)."
544,2," Following the lower courts and the parties, see In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 938 F.2d 919, 924, 925 (CA9 1991), we will 
treat the complaint filed by California as representative of the claims of Alabama, Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin, and the complaint filed by Connecticut as representative of the claims of Alaska, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. As will 
become apparent, the California and Connecticut Complaints differ slightly in their presentations of background information and 
their claims for relief; their statements of facts are identical. Because the private party plaintiffs have chosen in their brief in this 
Court to use the California Complaint as a ""representative model"" of their claims, Brief for Respondents (Private Party Plaintiffs) "
545,3," , n.6, we will assume that their complaints track that complaint. On remand, the courts below will of course be free to take into 
account any relevant differences among the complaints that the parties may bring to their attention."
545,3," The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, App. 88-90 (PP115-119), charges all the defendants with an 
overarching conspiracy to force all four of these changes on the insurance market. The eight federal-law Claims for Relief in the 
California Complaint, id., at 36-49 (PP111-150), charge various subgroups of the defendants with separate conspiracies that had 
more limited objects; not all of the defendants are alleged to have desired all four changes. "
546,4," The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 88-90 (PP115-119), charging an overarching conspiracy 
encompassing all of the defendants and all of the conduct alleged, is a special case. See n. 18, infra. "
547,5," The California and Connecticut Complaints' Statements of Facts describe this conspiracy as involving ""specialized reinsurers in 
London and the United States."" App. 34 (P106); id., at 87 (Conn. Complaint P110). The claims for relief, however, name only 
London reinsurers; they do not name any of the domestic defendants who are the petitioners in No. 91-1111. See id., at 48 
(P147); id., at 96 (Conn. Complaint P136). Thus, we assume that the domestic reinsurers alleged to be involved in this 
conspiracy are among the ""unnamed co-conspirators"" mentioned in the complaints. See id., at 48 (Cal. Complaint P147); id., at 
96 (Conn. Complaint P136). "
548,6," The Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Claims for Relief in the California Complaint, id., at 49-50 (PP151-156), and the Seventh Claim 
for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 98 (PP145-146), allege state-law violations not at issue here."
548,7," These are the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Claims for Relief in the California Complaint, and the corresponding Third, Fourth, and 
Fifth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint."
548,8," We limited our grant of certiorari in No. 91-1111 to these questions: ""1. Whether domestic insurance companies whose conduct 
otherwise would be exempt from the federal antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act lose that exemption because they 
participate with foreign reinsurers in the business of insurance,"" and ""2. Whether agreements among primary insurers and 
reinsurers on such matters as standardized advisory insurance policy forms and terms of insurance coverage constitute a 
'boycott' outside the exemption of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."" Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-1111, p. i; see 506 U.S. 814 (1992)."
548,9," The question presented in No. 91-1128 is: ""Did the court of appeals properly assess the extraterritorial reach of the U.S. 
antitrust laws in light of this Court's teachings and contemporary understanding of international law when it held that a U.S. 
district court may apply U.S. law to the conduct of a foreign insurance market regulated abroad?"" Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-1128, 
p. i. "
550,10," The activities in question here, of course, are alleged to violate federal law, and it might be tempting to think that unlawful acts 
are implicitly excluded from ""the business of insurance."" Yet § 2(b)'s grant of immunity assumes that acts which, but for that 
grant, would violate the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or the Federal Trade Commission Act, are part of ""the business of 
insurance."""
550,11," We also cited two cases dealing with the immunity of certain agreements of labor unions under the Clayton and Norris-
LaGuardia Acts. See 440 U.S. at 231-232. These cases, however, did not hold that labor unions lose their immunity whenever 
they enter into agreements with employers; to the contrary, we acknowledged in one of the cases that ""the law contemplates 
agreements on wages not only between individual employers and a union but agreements between the union and employers in 
a multi-employer bargaining unit."" Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965). 
Because the cases stand only for the proposition that labor unions are not immune from antitrust liability for certain types of 
agreements with employers, such as agreements ""to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units,"" id., at 665, they do 
not support the far more general statement that exempt entities lose immunity by conspiring with nonexempt entities. "
551,12," The Court of Appeals's assumption that ""the American reinsurers . . . are subject to regulation by the states and therefore 
prima facie immune,"" 938 F.2d at 928, appears to rest on the entity-based analysis we have rejected. As with the foreign 
reinsurers, we express no opinion whether the activities of the domestic reinsurers were ""regulated by State Law"" and leave that 
question to the Court of Appeals on remand."
551,20," As we have noted, see supra, at 776-777, each of these claims has a counterpart in the Connecticut Complaint. The claims 
each name different groups of London reinsurers, and not all of the named defendants are petitioners in No. 91-1128; but 
nothing in our analysis turns on these variations."
551,21," One of the London reinsurers, Sturge Reinsurance Syndicate Management Limited, argues that the Sherman Act does not 
apply to its conduct in attending a single meeting at which it allegedly agreed to exclude all pollution coverage from its 
reinsurance contracts. Brief for Petitioner Sturge Reinsurance Syndicate Management Ltd. in No. 91-1128, p. 22. Sturge may 
have attended only one meeting, but the allegations, which we are bound to credit, remain that it participated in conduct that was 
intended to and did in fact produce a substantial effect on the American insurance market. "
552,22," JUSTICE SCALIA believes that what is at issue in this litigation is prescriptive, as opposed to subject-matter, jurisdiction. Post, 
at 813-814. The parties do not question prescriptive jurisdiction, however, and for good reason: it is well established that 
Congress has exercised such jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. See G. Born & D. Westin, International Civil Litigation in 
United States Courts 542, n. 5 (2d ed. 1992) (Sherman Act is a ""prime example of the simultaneous exercise of prescriptive 
jurisdiction and grant of subject matter jurisdiction"")."
552,23," Under § 402 of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), 96 Stat. 1246, 15 U.S. C. § 6a, the Sherman 
Act does not apply to conduct involving foreign trade or commerce, other than import trade or import commerce, unless ""such 
conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic or import commerce. § 6a(1)(A). The FTAIA 
was intended to exempt from the Sherman Act export transactions that did not injure the United States economy, see H. R. Rep. 
No. 97-686, pp. 2-3, 9-10 (1982); P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P236'a, pp. 296-297 (Supp. 1992), and it is 
unclear how it might apply to the conduct alleged here. Also unclear is whether the Act's ""direct, substantial, and reasonably 
foreseeable effect"" standard amends existing law or merely codifies it. See id., P236'a, p. 297. We need not address these 
questions here. Assuming that the FTAIA's standard affects this litigation, and assuming further that that standard differs from 
the prior law, the conduct alleged plainly meets its requirements."
552,24," JUSTICE SCALIA contends that comity concerns figure into the prior analysis whether jurisdiction exists under the Sherman 
Act. Post, at 817-818. This contention is inconsistent with the general understanding that the Sherman Act covers foreign 
conduct producing a substantial intended effect in the United States, and that concerns of comity come into play, if at all, only 
after a court has determined that the acts complained of are subject to Sherman Act jurisdiction. See United States v. Aluminum 
Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 444 (CA2 1945) (""It follows from what we have . . . said that [the agreements at issue] were 
unlawful [under the Sherman Act], though made abroad, if they were intended to affect imports and did affect them""); 
Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1294 (CA3 1979) (once court determines that jurisdiction exists 
under the Sherman Act, question remains whether comity precludes its exercise); H. R. Rep. No. 97-686, supra, at 13. But cf.  
Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N. T. & S. A., 549 F.2d 597, 613 (CA9 1976); 1 J. Atwood & K. Brewster, Antitrust 
and American Business Abroad 166 (1981). In any event, the parties conceded jurisdiction at oral argument, see supra, at 795, 
and we see no need to address this contention here. "
553,25," JUSTICE SCALIA says that we put the cart before the horse in citing this authority, for he argues it may be apposite only after 
a determination that jurisdiction over the foreign acts is reasonable. Post, at 821. But whatever the order of cart and horse, 
conflict in this sense is the only substantial issue before the Court."
553,*," JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join this opinion in its entirety, and THE CHIEF JUSTICE 
joins Part I of this opinion. "
554,1," Section 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b), provides: ""Nothing contained in this Act shall render the said Sherman Act in-applicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, 
or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" "
555,2," Under the Oxford English Dictionary definition, of course, this example would not be a ""boycott"" because the tenants had not 
suspended all relations with the Captain. But if one recognizes partial boycotts (as we and JUSTICE SOUTER do), and if one 
believes (as JUSTICE SOUTER does but we do not) that the purpose of a boycott can be to secure different terms in the very 
transaction that is the supposed subject of the boycott, then it is impossible to explain why this is not a boycott. Under JUSTICE 
SOUTER's reasoning, it would be a boycott, at least if the tenants acted ""at the behest of"" (whatever that means), ante, at 792, 
the Irish Land League. This hypothetical shows that the problems presented by partial boycotts (which we agree fall within § 
3(b)) make more urgent the need to distinguish boycotts from concerted agreements on terms."
555,3," JUSTICE SOUTER points out that the Court in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. 
Ct. 2923 (1978), found the term ""boycott"" ""does not refer to '""a unitary phenomenon,""'"" ante, at 788 (quoting Barry, supra, at 543 
(quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (2d ed. 1974))), and asserts that our position contradicts this. Ante, at 793-794. But to 
be not a ""unitary phenomenon"" is different from being an all-encompassing one. ""Boycott"" is a multifaceted ""phenomenon"" that 
includes conditional boycotts, punitive boycotts, coercive boycotts, partial boycotts, labor boycotts, political boycotts, social 
boycotts, etc. It merely does not include refusals to deal because of objections to proposed terms."

(distinguishing between ordinary strikes and boycotts). "
557,6," Once it is determined that the actions of the reinsurers did not constitute a ""boycott,"" but rather a concerted agreement to 
terms, it follows that their actions do not constitute ""coercion"" or ""intimidation"" within the meaning of the statute. That is because, 
as previously mentioned, such concerted agreements do ""not coerce anyone, at least in the usual sense of that word,"" L. 
Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 257 (1977), and because they are precisely what is protected by McCarran-Ferguson immunity. "
559,7," We agree with JUSTICE SOUTER's conclusion, ante, at 790-791, n. 18, that the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California 
Complaint and the Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint fail to allege any § 3(b) boycotts."
559,13," Petitioners correctly concede this point. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 91-1111, p. 32, n. 14. "
560,14," As we have noted before, see Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 217, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 
1067 (1979); SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 458, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668, 89 S. Ct. 564 (1969), the McCarran-
Ferguson Act was precipitated by our holding in South-Eastern Underwriters that the business of insurance was interstate 
commerce and thus subject generally to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause, and to scrutiny under the Sherman Act 
specifically. Congress responded, both to ""ensure that the States would continue to have the ability to tax and regulate the 
business of insurance,"" Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. at 217-218 (footnote omitted), and to limit the application of the antitrust laws 
to the insurance industry, id., at 218. In drafting the § 3(b) exception to the § 2(b) grant of antitrust immunity, Congress borrowed 
language from our description of the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters as charging that ""the conspirators not only fixed 
premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together with other types of coercion and intimidation to force 
nonmember insurance companies into the conspiracies."" 322 U.S. at 535."
560,15," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S. C. § 2, prohibits monopolization of, or attempts or 
conspiracies to monopolize, ""any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations."" "
561,16," The majority claims that this refusal to deal was a boycott only because ""membership in the association [had] no discernible 
bearing upon the terms of the refused reinsurance contracts."" Post, at 809. Testimony at the hearings on the bill that became the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act indicates that the insurance companies thought otherwise. ""We say 'You do not issue insurance to a 
company that does not do business the way we think it should be done and belong to our association.' . . . It is for the protection 
of the public, the stockholders, and the companies . . . . You know when those large risks are taken that they have to be 
reinsured. We do not want to have to take a risk that is bad, or at an improper rate, or an excessive commission, we do not want 
our agents to take that, nor do we want to reinsure part of the risk that is written that way. We feel this way -- that some groups 
are doing business in what is not the proper way, we feel it is not in the interest of the companies and it is not in the interest of 
the public, and we just do not want to do business with them."" Joint Hearing on S. 1362, H. R. 3269, and H. R. 3270 before the 
Subcommittees of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 333 (1943) (statement of Edward L. 
Williams, President, Insurance Executives Association)."
561,17," In passing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Justice Stewart argued, ""Congress plainly wanted to allow the States to authorize 
anticompetitive practices which they determined to be in the public interest."" St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 
531, 565, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 (1978) (dissenting opinion). Hence, § 2(b) provides that the federal antitrust laws will 
generally not be applicable to those insurance business practices ""regulated by State law,"" and presumably state law could, for 
example, either mandate price fixing, or specifically authorize voluntary price-fixing agreements. On the other hand, Congress 
intended to delegate regulatory power only to the States; nothing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act suggests that Congress wanted 
one insurer, or a group of insurers, to be able to formulate and enforce policy for other insurers. Thus, the enforcement activities 
that distinguish § 3(b) ""boycotts"" from other concerted activity include, in this context, ""private enforcement . . . of industry rules 
and practices, even if those rules and practices are permitted by state law."" Id., at 565-566 (emphasis in original) (footnote 
omitted). "
562,18," The First and Sixth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, and the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California 
Complaint, which also name some or all of the petitioners, present special cases. The First Claim for Relief in the Connecticut 
Complaint alleges an overarching conspiracy involving all of the defendants named in the complaint and all of the conduct 
alleged. As such, it encompasses ""boycott"" activity, and the Court of Appeals was correct to reverse the District Court's order 
dismissing it. As currently described in the complaint's statement of facts, however, some of the actions of the reinsurers and the 
retrocessional reinsurers appear to have been taken independently, rather than at the behest of the primary insurer defendants. I 
express no opinion as to whether those acts, if they were indeed taken independently, could amount to § 3(b) boycotts; but I 
note that they lack the key element on which I rely in this litigation to find a sufficient allegation of boycott. The Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, and the virtually identical Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut 
Complaint, allege a conspiracy among a group of domestic primary insurers, foreign reinsurers, and the ISO to draft restrictive 
model forms and policy language for ""umbrella"" and ""excess"" insurance. On these claims, the Court of Appeals reversed the 
District Court's order of dismissal as to the domestic defendants solely because those defendants ""acted in concert"" with 
nonexempt foreign defendants, 938 F.2d, at 931, relying on reasoning that the Court has found to be in error, see supra, at 781-
784. The Court of Appeals found that ""no boycotts [were] alleged as the defendants' modus operandi in respect to [excess and 
umbrella] insurance."" 938 F.2d, at 930. I agree; even under a liberal construction of the complaints in favor of plaintiffs, I can find 
no allegation of any refusal to deal in connection with the drafting of the excess and umbrella insurance language. Therefore I 
conclude that neither the participation of unregulated parties nor the application of § 3(b) furnished a basis to reverse the District 
Court's dismissal of these claims as against the domestic insurers, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in 
this respect. The Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Claims for Relief in the California Complaint and the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Claims for 
Relief in the Connecticut Complaint also allege concerted refusals to deal; but because they do not name any of the petitioners 
in No. 91-1111, the Court has no occasion to consider whether they allege § 3(b) boycotts. "
563,19," The majority contends that its concept of boycott is still ""multifaceted"" because it can be modified by such adjectives as 
""punitive,"" ""labor,"" ""political,"" and ""social."" Post, at 804, n. 3. This does not hide the fact that it is attempting to concoct a ""precise 
definition"" of the term, post, at 800, composed of a simple set of necessary and sufficient conditions. "
564,8," The counts at issue in this litigation are the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Claims for Relief in the California Complaint. See App. 43-
46 (PP131-140), id., at 47-49 (PP146-150). "
566,9," Some antitrust courts, including the Court of Appeals in the present cases, have mistaken the comity at issue for the ""comity of 
courts,"" which has led them to characterize the question presented as one of ""abstention,"" that is, whether they should ""exercise 
or decline jurisdiction."" Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1294, 1296 (CA3 1979); see also In re 
Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 938 F.2d 919, 932 (CA9 1991). As I shall discuss, that seems to be the error the Court has fallen 
into today. Because courts are generally reluctant to refuse the exercise of conferred jurisdiction, confusion on this seemingly 
theoretical point can have the very practical consequence of greatly expanding the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act. "
567,10," Some of the British corporations are subsidiaries of American corporations, and the Court of Appeals held that ""the interests of 
Britain are at least diminished where the parties are subsidiaries of American corporations."" Id., at 933. In effect, the Court of 
Appeals pierced the corporate veil in weighing the interests at stake. I do not think that was proper. "
568,11," The Court skips directly to subsection (3) of § 403, apparently on the authority of Comment j to § 415 of the Restatement 
(Third). See ante, at 799. But the preceding commentary to § 415 makes clear that ""any exercise of [legislative] jurisdiction 
under this section is subject to the requirement of reasonableness"" set forth in § 403(2). Restatement (Third) § 415, Comment a. 
Comment j refers back to the conflict analysis set forth in § 403(3), which, as noted above, comes after the reasonableness 
analysis of § 403(2). "

590,22," Some of the research was organized into a useful format for the court's consumption, but much of it contained some rather 
bold assertions regarding the merits of plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim. As previously noted, the court takes great pains to caution 
that a peek into the merits at this stage is very premature and wholly inappropriate. The court is merely interested in the legal 
criteria for the motions to dismiss and motion for class certification, which are quite specific. It follows then that the court finds no

questions over individual issues. Blue Bird, 573 F.2d at 323."
592,25," Beyer Affidavit, para. 23 [fn 30]. "
593,26," For one example, a number of theories are offered regarding the impact of a price fixing scheme wherein Delta Pride is 
allegedly a major participant. Since Delta Pride is a farmer-owned cooperative with a large share of the catfish market, Delta 
Pride is able to return profits from inflated prices to the member producers in the form of patronage rebates. Hence, defendants 
claim that Delta Pride's objectives in a price fixing scheme would be different from the remaining defendants which are 
corporations motivated by the profit margin. The obvious difference exists in who ""shares the wealth"" as a result of inflated, 
artificial price levels. In the court's view, this distinction is of no significant consequence. In the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint, 
it is alleged that the price fixing conspiracy in the catfish food chain existed in the processor-distributor link, not producer-
processor. "
596,27," The court also considers that the majority of the individual actions as listed in footnote two were filed in this district, and it 
appears that key events which will be in issue are alleged to have taken place in this district. See F.R.C.P. 23(b)(3)(A-D)."

600,*, Hon. William H. Timbers of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is sitting by designation. 
602,1," Application Note 13 states in full: Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, or a similarly general statute, 
although the offense is also covered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries regarding currency 
transactions, for which § 2S1.3 would be more apt, and false statements to a customs officer, for which § 2T3.1 likely would 
be more apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as 
jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other offenses. For example, a state arson offense where a fraudulent insurance 
claim was mailed might be prosecuted as mail fraud. Where the indictment or information setting forth the count of 
conviction (or a stipulation as described in § 1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline, 
apply that guideline rather than § 2F1.1. Otherwise, in such cases, § 2F1.1 is to be applied, but a departure from the 
guidelines may be considered. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, § 2F1.1, comment. (n.13) (Nov. 1989) (""U.S.S.G."") (emphasis 
added). Application Note 13 conveys the Sentencing Commission's recognition that the broad nature of such general fraud 
statutes as 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements) and 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Mail Fraud) sometimes apply to offense conduct that ""is 
also covered by a more specific statute."" Id. "
604,2," We also note the government's reliance on Application Note 5 to Guidelines section 1B1.1: ""Where two or more guideline 
provisions appear equally applicable, but the guidelines authorize the application of only one such provision, use the provision 
that results in the greater offense level."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, comment. (n.5) (Nov. 1989). Application Note 5 does not apply here 
because § 2R1.1 and § 2F1.1 are not ""equally applicable"" to the mail fraud counts. In light of Application Note 13, § 2R1.1 
applies and § 2F1.1 does not. "

625,5," The concepts of ancillary and pendent jurisdiction are now termed ""supplemental jurisdiction"". Judicial Improvements Act of 
1990, Pub. L. No. 101-650, § 310, 104 Stat. 5089, 5113-14 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1367). "
627,6," We take note that in City of Columbia the Court expressly left open the question of whether antitrust action may be brought 
against a state when there is no Parker immunity. We too do not reach that question. "
639,1," The 1962 license imposes an irrevocable, royalty-free grant-back license, which permits Pilkington to use or sub-license any 
technological improvements developed by the licensee, and requires that all disputes arising under the license to be arbitrated in 
London under English law."
639,2, PPG concedes that the arbitrators also found that some of the items were covered by the 1962 license. 
640,3," The Ninth Circuit stated that: While market share is just the starting point for assessing market power, we think that market share, at least above some 
level, could support a finding of market power in the absence of contrary evidence. Where such an inference is not 
implausible on its face, an allegation of a specific market share is sufficient, as a matter of pleading, to withstand a motion 
for dismissal. With nothing but Hunt's complaint before us, we cannot say that allegations that Ragu had a 65 per cent 
market share, and that the share of the market was increasing, could not under any market conditions provide a basis for 
inferring the requisite market power. Hunt-Wesson, 627 F.2d at 925. "
642,4," PPG also cites documentary evidence, such as Pilkington's 1992 Annual Report, and declarations of counsel to support its 
allegations. But because this a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court will simply take PPG's allegations as true and not look beyond 
the Complaint. Therefore, the Court will not consider this documentary evidence in reaching its decision. "
643,5," The Supreme Court was referring to Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993 (1964), 
and its progeny. "
645,6," During the arbitration proceedings begun in 1985, PPG submitted a draft federal court complaint alleging antitrust claims to the 
arbitrators for an advisory opinion concerning the arbitrability of the claims. "
652,7," The full quote is as follows: The mere appearance of an antitrust dispute does not alone warrant invalidation of the selected forum on the 
undemonstrated assumption that the arbitration clause is tainted. A party resisting arbitration of course may attack directly 
the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 
18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967). Moreover, the party may attempt to make a showing that would warrant setting aside the forum-
selection clause--that the agreement was ""affected by fraud, undue influence, or overweening bargaining power""; that 
""enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust""; or that proceedings ""in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult 
and inconvenient that [the resisting party] will for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court."" The Bremen, 407 
U.S. at 12, 15, 92 S. Ct. at 1914, 1916, 1917. But absent such a showing--and none was attempted here--there is no basis 
for assuming the forum inadequate or its selection unfair. Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 632-33. "
662,1," On July 31, 1992, the district court also issued a separate memorandum and order denying the defendants' motion to revoke 
the conditional class certification. The defendants have not cross-appealed from that order."
662,2," We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this antitrust action for 
damages and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1337 and 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26. "
663,3," Section 1 states in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."
663,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
664,4," The district court did not discuss whether Petruzzi's IGA established a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the other 
three elements of a section 1 claim. Likewise, the defendants have not argued to this court that Petruzzi's IGA's evidence falls 
short with respect to these other elements. Accordingly, we do not consider them in this appeal. Rather, we assess only whether 
Petruzzi's IGA has put forth enough evidence regarding the defendants' alleged concerted action to withstand the defendants' 
motions for summary judgment."
664,5," Of course, contrary to popular thought a smoking gun might be mere circumstantial evidence unless the witness saw it fired. "
666,6," The service provided by the renderers was homogeneous in that they all did the same thing, pick up the materials. In this case, 
the materials sold by the suppliers was for the most part homogeneous as well. Accordingly, the renderers would have no 
reason to be concerned about who supplied them with raw materials. The only exception is that Standard did not pick up suet 
and meat trimmings, but only fat and bones, which the industry calls ""ice cream."""
666,7, In fact circumstantial evidence could be quite compelling. See note 5 supra. 
667,8," Darling discounts the meaning of Salisbury's testimony by pointing out that Salisbury was not aware of any meeting with 
Darling. Darling's Brief at 9. However, this fact simply means that Salisbury could not supply direct evidence of an agreement. It 
does not diminish the value of his circumstantial evidence. Similarly, Darling asserts that the only reason that Salisbury was told 
this was because the stores were under contract. Id. at 9. However, this narrow construction of Salisbury's more general 
statements is not appropriate, at least at the summary judgment stage, especially considering that later in the deposition 
Salisbury reaffirmed his assertion that an agreement existed. See App. at 2224. "
668,9," While this statement as it stands now is hearsay, in this circuit it can be considered on a motion for summary judgment 
because it is capable of being admissible at trial. See J.F. Feeser, Inc., 909 F.2d at 1542. Petruzzi's IGA simply has to produce 
the Southern Tier principal to give this testimony. In any event, our result would be the same even if we ignored Ebersole's 
testimony on this point. "
669,10, There seems to be a dispute as to whether there was a five-year contract. 
670,11," A gas station might give a discount to a frequent customer to promote customer loyalty. If the defendants wanted to promote 
customer loyalty through pricing they would, as purchasers, raise prices."
670,12," Darling and Moyer obviously are not harmed by our use of the abuse of discretion standard inasmuch as we surely would 
have come to the same result regarding this evidence if we had exercised plenary review, i.e., the evidence should not have 
been excluded. While in theory Petruzzi's IGA could be prejudiced by the deferential review inasmuch as it is seeking to overturn 
the district court's Rule 403 determination, in fact it is not because we rule the evidence admissible as to all defendants, though 
as we shall explain, it is inadequate to support Petruzzi's IGA's case against Standard. "
671,13," Perhaps facetiously, Darling states that the plaintiff's experts had expertise only in economics, not as ""cospiratologists [sic]."" 
Darling's Brief at 25. But as we have noted, ""Characterizing the expert as an 'oath-helper,' or a 'conspiracyologist,' is no 
substitute for recognition of the rule of law embodied in Rule 702."" In re Japanese Elec. Prods., 723 F.2d at 280. "
672,14," While the defendants do not concede that this ruling was correct, they do not launch an all-out assault on it. See Darling's Brief 
at 25 n.24; Standard's Brief at 38 n.28. "
675,15," Petruzzi's IGA submitted other evidence which it contends showed the existence of a conspiracy among the defendants. This 
information included social contacts and telephone calls among representatives of the defendants. In light of our conclusion that 
summary judgment should not have been granted based on the testimony of Salisbury, Ebersole, and the economic experts, we 
do not consider this evidence. We do note, however, that the evidence is insufficient to exclude the possibility that Standard 
acted independently. See Tose v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., 648 F.2d at 894 (""Proof of opportunity to conspire, without 
more, will not sustain an inference that a conspiracy has taken place."")."
675,16," For instance, most major banks raise or lower their prime rates when the Federal Reserve lowers the rate it charges them. 
Banks are certainly aware of the other banks decisions and are motivated, at least in part, by their competitors' actions. 
Nonetheless, proof of only this behavior is not sufficient to establish a section 1 violation. See In re Japanese Elec. Prods., 723 
F.2d at 304 (""While conscious parallel conduct has some tendency suggestive of concert of action, the tendency is so slight that 
we have held that circumstance, standing alone, to be legally insufficient.""). "
677,17," Moreover, in this respect, the testimony relating to the defendants' opportunity to conspire and the solicitation of others to 
partake in common action is also relevant. See Holmes, supra, § 1.03[3], at 154; note 15 supra. "
678,18," This behavior is different than an oligopolist responding to a price cut by one competitor with an equal or lower price. In that 
case, presumably the price is still above the oligopolist's costs and thus makes sense. Moreover, that price typically is offered to 
all its customers, not just those who are customers of the price-reducer. Furthermore, as Professor Areeda states: One oligopolist may refrain from lowering his price because he fears, indeed knows that his rivals will match it. But that 
differs from the situation of the present subparagraph where the feared retaliation is something more coercive than 
matched behavior. VI Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1415f, at 93 n.27. "
679,19," Petruzzi's IGA also argues that the documents were admissible because Lee Ryder asserted the attorney-client privilege over 
them in his deposition. However, our reading of the record does not reveal any such assertion by Lee Ryder and the reference to 
the record in Petruzzi's IGA's Reply Brief at 13 to support its argument is not to his deposition. Furthermore, Ellerin testified in 
her deposition that she prepared the document in her capacity as a spouse, not as a lawyer. App. at 978. Moreover, Ellerin 
testified that she and Lee Ryder showed the document to the government, thereby removing any possibility of a claim of 
privilege. App. at 980. In any event, even if Lee Ryder asserted a claim of privilege over the document, he did not vouch, as 
Petruzzi's IGA suggests, that he was the source of the information nor did he vouch for the accuracy of the statements in the 
document. "
680,20," Petruzzi's IGA also has suggested that the fact that the defendants' discussed the prices of finished goods indicates that they 
acted in concert. The district court rejected this conclusion, noting that the prices for finished goods were reported in the trade 
reports and that any inference relating to the raw materials market would be too speculative. Opin. at 47-48. We agree with the 
district court that evidence of these discussions among the defendants in one context is insufficient to draw an inference of 
conspiracy in another market. "
684,1," Although both sides have captioned their briefs to show ""Tri-State Rubbish, Inc., et al."" as the plaintiffs-appellants, the notice of 
appeal names only Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. as the appellant. Our caption and other references to Hart and Recycling Unlimited 
are without prejudice to any consequences that may flow on remand from the way the notice of appeal was framed. "
685,2," In Waste Management of the Desert, Inc. v. Palm Springs Recycling Center, Inc., 9 Cal. App. 4th 239, 11 Cal. Rptr. 2d 676 
(Cal. App.), petition for review granted, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 850, 840 F.2d 955 (1992), the California statute reserved the right of 
anyone ""to donate, sell or otherwise dispose of his or her recyclable materials"" and of any private company to contract with a 
private waste hauler to remove segregated recyclable materials.  11 Cal. Rptr. at 683-84."
685,3," The only participants named in count I are the municipalities and MMWAC. Since their conduct is authorized by statute, the 
state action doctrine applies. Contrary to Tri-State's claim, municipalities (or their instrumentalities) engaged in state-authorized 
conduct are not themselves required to be further supervised by the state. See Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 47. "
686,4," Tri-State's assertion of a $ 9 per ton ""net"" tipping fee appears to be faulty economics. The $ 66 per ton payment to the 
Consolidated companies was to cover the cost of receiving and disposing of the waste. Whether or not the cost to the 
Consolidated companies was actually $ 66 per ton, it is not likely to have been zero."
686,5," The record does not explain why, given MMWAC's need for fuel, it would make sense for MMWAC to offer the $ 24 tipping fee 
exclusively to Waste Management of Maine. While we accept the allegation as true for purposes of this appeal, we note that 
MMWAC's brief denies that this is what happened."
686,6," See, e.g., Riverview Investments, Inc. v. Ottawa Community Improvement Corp., 774 F.2d 162 (6th Cir. 1985)."
686,7," Gold Cross Ambulance & Transfer v. City of Kansas City, 705 F.2d 1005 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1003, 85 L. Ed. 
2d 158, 105 S. Ct. 1864 (1985); Tom Hudson & Assocs. v. City of Chula Vista, 746 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 472 
U.S. 1028, 87 L. Ed. 2d 634, 105 S. Ct. 3503 (1985); Savage v. Waste Management, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 1505 (D.S.C. 1985); 
see also P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 212.7c at 196-97 (Supp. 1992). "
687,8," MMWAC is also charged in these counts but, apart from bare references to conspiracy, there is nothing in the complaint to 
connect MMWAC with Waste Management's actions vis-a-vis its own customers except the favorable tipping fees. Since the fee 
payments are state action, we do not think that any claim has been stated against MMWAC based on Waste Management's 
alleged predation. "
688,9," Exclusive dealing, which can be attacked inter alia under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, can be condemned 
without a showing that monopoly power is present or within reach. But the impact on competition is part of the equation and, 
absent a potential monopoly or oligopoly, the competitive impact may be hard to establish. "
689,10," The Waste Management defendants are also free to pursue their Parker defense as to the predation claims. Our holding is 
that on this record there is an insufficient basis for determining that Parker immunity exists as to the terms on which Waste 
Management of Maine deals with its customers. "
690,11," See California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works, 199 U.S. 306, 50 L. Ed. 204, 26 S. Ct. 100 (1905); Gardner v. 
Michigan, 199 U.S. 325, 50 L. Ed. 212, 26 S. Ct. 106 (1905). "
697,1," Specifically, petitioners include Ticor Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company, SAFECO Title Insurance 
Company (now known as Security Union Title Insurance Company), Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, and Stewart Title 
Guaranty Company."
697,2," The complaint made charges against a sixth title insurance company which have been settled. Thus, the FTC's final order 
affected only the five title insurance companies who have joined as petitioners before this Court."
697,3," HN1[
] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes agreements among competitors to influence legislative, judicial, or 
administrative action from antitrust liability. See United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 , 85 S. Ct. 
1585 (1965); Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 , 81 S. Ct. 523 
(1961)."
697,4, This proviso merely restates the requirements of the state action doctrine. See infra typescript at 18-19. 
698,5," Before the Supreme Court, the parties confined their briefing on the first issue to the regulatory schemes of Wisconsin and 
Montana, and on the second issue to Connecticut and Arizona.  Ticor, 112 S. Ct. at 2176. The FTC did not challenge this Court's 
ruling in Ticor I that the New Jersey and Pennsylvania schemes satisfied the ""clearly established policy"" requirement of the state 
action doctrine. See infra typescript at 18-19. "
701,6," This section provides, HN6[
] No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the 
purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act 
specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, 
known as the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of 
September 26, 1914, known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of 
insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law."
701,15, U.S.C.A. § 1012(b) (West 1976). 
704,7," For a detailed history and explanation of the rationale behind the state action doctrine, see Ticor, 112 S. Ct. at 2176-78. "
705,8," Notwithstanding this statutory system, in practice the Arizona Rating Bureau's rate submissions were not put into effect until 
actually stamped ""approved"" by the director."
705,9," Connecticut law did not require that insurance rate filings be subject to public notice, comment, and hearings, or that a written 
decision, appealable to state courts, be issued with respect to each rate filing. State insurance regulators were opposed to any 
such strict procedural requirements on the grounds of cost and the inevitable delay in responding to market forces that such 
regulatory procedures would entail. "
708,10," I am not persuaded by the Commission's reliance on footnote nine of Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. at 213-14 n.9. In that case, the 
Court held that the ""business of insurance"" did not encompass agreements between Blue Shield and participating pharmacies 
regarding the prices that Blue Shield would pay the pharmacies for prescription drugs furnished to Blue Shield policyholders. 
While I find footnote nine somewhat unclear, I think it is best understood to mean only that the ""business of insurance"" under 
Section 2(b) does not necessarily encompass everything that an insurance company must do, following issuance of policies, in 
order to ensure that promised policy benefits are provided to its insureds. See Pireno, 458 U.S. at 130 (""business of insurance"" 
does not include arrangements that come into play only after the insurance contract is entered). By contrast, title searches and 
examinations occur before the title insurance contract is entered and play an essential role in defining the risk that is transferred. 
Thus, I do not think that footnote nine is controlling here. "
709,11," Because I would reverse the Commission's order based on Section 2(b), I do not address the alternative grounds for reversal 
advanced by the petitioners. "
716,1," As the parties do not object to the factual allegations as set out in the Report, the Court restates them here as they appeared 
in the Report. "
725,2," It should also be noted that pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 187 plaintiff may bring a claim for damages in the United States District 
Court against Local 196 for any violations of 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4) (1988). "
738,1," Accordingly, in addition to any premiums which were paid to Humana Insurance by the employer or employee, the employee 
insured would ultimately be responsible for up to $ 1,000 (20% of $ 5,000) before Humana would absorb 100% of covered 
hospital charges. Errata (#822) at 123-125. "
739,2," In the Order, this Court defined a ""claim for benefits"" as a situation where ""an insured puts in a claim and the insurance 
company denies it."" Order (#364) at 6."
739,3," In so doing this Court primarily relied upon a broad interpretation of Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union v. 
Murdock, 861 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1988) and distinguished the holdings of Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 
U.S. 134, 87 L. Ed. 2d 96, 105 S. Ct. 3085 (1985) and Sokol v. Bernstein, 803 F.2d 532 (9th Cir. 1986)."
739,4," Defendant Humana Insurance claims that the total number of insureds who had a co-payment obligation to Humana Hospital 
Sunrise as a percentage of the number of total insureds was 11.68% (16,412/140,487), whereas the total number of insureds 
whose co-payment obligation would have declined if their coinsurance was calculated on the discounted amount as a 
percentage of the number of total insureds was 9.54% (13,049/140,487). Plaintiffs state that the 9.54% is not supported by the 
evidence, but do concede that not all employees covered under the various health plans were hospitalized at Humana Hospital 
Sunrise. Opposition (#820), Exhibit 93; Errata (#822) at 207, n. 404. "
740,5," More specifically, the Supreme Court stated: HN9[
] A fair contextual reading of (§ 1109) makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets, and with remedies that would protect the entire plan, rather than with the rights of an 
individual beneficiary. . . . The entire text of (§ 1109) persuades us that Congress did not intend to authorize any relief 
except for the plan itself. Russell, 473 U.S. at 142, 144 (emphasis added)."
740,6," This Court also recognizes that the position adopted by the Ninth Circuit in Sokol directly contradicts Justice William Brennan's 
interpretation of § 1132(a)(3) found in his concurring opinion in Russell. See Order (#364) at 9; Russell (Brennan, J., concurring) 
at 153-155; Sokol, 803 F.2d at 534-538. "
741,7," In Murdock, the fiduciary used plan assets to further a ""greenmail"" scheme to benefit his own individual assets. After the 
scheme was successful (with both the plan and the fiduciary making substantial profits as a result), the fiduciary then amended 
the plan so that any excess funds would revert to the administrator. With the plan so changed, the fiduciary then paid all 
beneficiaries the value of their vested interests under the plan and retained all excess monies for himself (e.g. the profits made 
by the plan based on the use of its assets in the greenmail scheme). Murdock, 861 F.2d at 1408-1409."
741,8," In the July 9, 1991 Order (#364), this Court also cited Call v. Sumitomo Bank, 881 F.2d 626, 631-32 (9th Cir. 1989) for the 
proposition that the Russell decision should not be narrowly construed. This Court now concludes that the language used for this 
proposition was dicta, and furthermore, that the Court in Call itself recognized that HN12[
] ""'ERISA grants no private right of 
action by a beneficiary qua beneficiary; rather it accords beneficiaries the right to sue on behalf of the entire plan if a fiduciary 
breaches the plan's terms.'"" Id. at 632, n. 13 (citing Sokol). See also Murdock, 861 F.2d at 1417. "
742,9," This Court also recognizes that in its Motion for Summary Judgment (#804), Humana Insurance concedes that such a claim is 
proper, and has stipulated that to the extent the Co-Payor Class would be required to exhaust their administrative remedies prior 
to bringing a claim for benefits, such a requirement would be waived. See Motion for Summary Judgment (#804) at 22. In 
addition, this Court finds that to avoid any unjust enrichment on the part of Humana Insurance, Plaintiffs would be entitled 
individually to obtain prejudgment interest for any relief provided under § 1132(a)(1)(B). Rivera v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., 921 
F.2d 692 (7th Cir. 1991); Short v. Central States, S.E. & S.W. Areas Pension Fund, 729 F.2d 567, 576 (8th Cir. 1984); see also 
Blanton v. Anzalone, 760 F.2d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir. 1985)."
742,10," The following discussion regarding the proper manner in which to calculate damages is applicable to a theory of liability 
predicated upon both § 1132(a)(1)(B) and breach of fiduciary duty. Thus, although this Court has disallowed Plaintiffs' fiduciary 
duty claim, this ruling does not affect the measure of damages to be awarded to Plaintiffs. Using the example provided by 
Plaintiffs, assume the following: (1) Gross hospital charge = $ 5,000. (2) Amount paid by insured = $ 1,000 (.20 X $ 5,000). (3) Amount paid by Humana Insurance after taking an 89% discount = $ 550 (.89 X $ 5,000). (4) Total amount paid to Sunrise = $ 1,550 ($ 1,000 + $ 550). Plaintiffs argue that appropriate damages for Humana Insurance's breach of fiduciary duty would be to require it to ""disgorge the 
entire 'secret' discount"" obtained by Humana Insurance from Sunrise. Based on their statement that ""disgorgement of the 
unilateral discounts actually requires Humana Insurance to pay 80% of the gross charges,"" this amount would presumably be $ 
3,450 ($ 4,000 (.80 X $ 5,000) - $ 550). See Errata (#822) at 123-26. "
743,11," Note that the net discount given on the hospital bill is 69% ($ 3,450/$ 5,000) and the net discount given on the portion of the 
bill for which Humana Insurance was responsible is 86.25% ($ 3,450/$ 4,000) Accordingly, Plaintiffs' assertion that Humana 
Insurance received an 89% discount is inaccurate. See supra, n. 10; Errata (#822) at 124-125."
743,12, See Second Amended Complaint (#370) at 8.
743,13," In their Fourth Supplemental Opposition (#896) Plaintiffs argue that the recent United States Supreme Court case Mertens v. 
Hewitt Assocs., 124 L. Ed. 2d 161, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 61 U.S.L.W. 4510 (1993), stands for the proposition that this Court has the 
ability to create a trust composed of all discounts yielded by Sunrise to Humana Insurance as a remedy for Humana Insurance's 
alleged breach of fiduciary duty. This Court disagrees. The primary holding of Mertens is that ""appropriate equitable relief"" under 
§ 1132(a)(3) does not permit compensatory losses for breaches of fiduciary duty, but rather only traditional forms of equitable 
relief such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution of ill-gotten profits. 61 U.S.L.W. at 4513-14. Such a holding does not aid 
Plaintiffs because, as discussed above, Plaintiffs' argument that the entire discount yielded by Sunrise to Humana Insurance are 
Humana Insurance's ""ill-gotten profits"" is erroneous. "
744,14," In light of this Court's findings regarding the Co-Payor Class' inability to pursue a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, this Court 
need not address Defendants' second argument that Humana Insurance was not a fiduciary when it negotiated the discount with 
Sunrise."
744,15," In support of the assertion that Humana made ""supracompetitive"" profits, Plaintiffs allege that: (1) Nevada hospitals have the 
highest profit margins in the country and that Sunrise was the most profitable hospital in Nevada; (2) Sunrise was the most 
profitable hospital in the Humana organization; (3) Notwithstanding the fact that Sunrise's market share decreased during the 
relevant time period, its net operating revenue during this period increased; and (4) During 1988 when Nevada's cost 
containment statute was in place, Sunrise's operating margin was excessive compared to other hospitals nationally. Errata (#822) at 278-81. "
745,16," The only evidence that Plaintiffs submit in support of this allegation of market share is a December 7, 1984 memo which 
states that ""non-Humana usage was 19%"" for Humana insurance insureds. Errata (#822) at 305; Exhibit 132. "
746,17," This Court also recognizes that the Ninth Circuit's decisions on this point have been called into doubt by the United States 
Supreme Court's recent decision, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). Spectrum 
Sports HN18[
] held that an inquiry into market definition and market power is a prerequisite for a claim of attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 891-92. Even without regard to Spectrum Sports, however, it is clear that 
Plaintiffs have not satisfied Ninth Circuit precedent which limits the necessity of a market analysis. "
747,18," Even if this Court were to accept the argument that the hospitals used by Humana Insurance insureds could constitute a 
relevant submarket, Plaintiffs fail to address: (1) the fact that Humana insureds were able to (and did) easily switch health 
insurance policies; (2) the fact that under the Humana policy, Plaintiffs were not precluded from choosing hospitals other than 
Sunrise; and (3) what other hospitals were competing within this market. See Reply (#841) at 72-75. Failure to address these 
facts clearly precludes finding the existence of Plaintiffs' proposed submarket. Further, to the extent Plaintiffs rely on the Kodak decision to support a claim for an illegal tying arrangement between Humana 
and Humana Insurance, such a claim is without merit as the undisputed facts indicate that Humana Insurance never possessed 
sufficient market share to exercise market power within the group health insurance market. See Reply (#841), Exhibit N, 
Supplemental Affidavit of Barry C. Harris at 16-22 (Humana Insurance's share of Clark County residents covered by commercial 
health insurance was the following - 1984/4%, 1985/18%, 1986/24%, 1987/17%, 1988/15%); Barry v. Blue Cross of California, 
805 F.2d 866, 870-74 (9th Cir. 1986); Ezpeleta v. Sisters of Mercy Hospital Corp., 800 F.2d 119, 121-122 (7th Cir. 1986)."
747,19," More specifically, on May 20, 1987, Donald Stewart testified: Large, full service hospitals with the latest in medical technology compete vigorously against each other for market share. 
However, smaller primary care hospitals, charging less and not providing as specialized or technical care have found a 
niche in the market. For the most part, the larger hospitals do not compete against them. That will change with this bill. By forcing a rollback of our billed charges and a deep reduction in revenue per admission, the 
state will prevent us from being the kind of hospital we want to be, and force us and other large hospitals into markets we 
currently avoid. If you limit our prices and our revenue per admission, the only response left to us in the market is to increase our volume. 
This will require expanding into markets we don't currently pursue and competing directly for the segments of the market 
that are the mainstay of smaller hospitals. . . . The marketplace is dynamic and changing. You cannot change that by 
legislation. See Errata (#822), Exhibit 125, at 7-8."
747,20," Plaintiffs also allege that physicians who practiced at Valley often did not admit its patients to UMC. See Errata (#822) at 299. 
Even if this fact is true, this Court fails to see how it helps to establish that UMC and Sunrise were not competitors. "
748,21," There is really no dispute as to the geographic market in this case. As established by Defendants' experts, the consumers in 
the market in which Sunrise competes regularly seek care at hospitals throughout Clark County. See Motion for Summary 
Judgement (#804) at 64-72; Reply (#841) Exhibit N, Supplemental Affidavit of Barry Harris, at 6-8, 13-14; Exhibit Z, 
Supplemental Affidavit of Harold M. Ting, at 21. Although Plaintiffs raise the point that UMC may be in a different geographic 
area than Sunrise, such an assertion is easily refuted by the analysis presented by Defendants' experts, the fact that UMC is 
only 3 miles away from Sunrise, and the fact that Valley Hospital, which Plaintiffs assert is a competitor of Sunrise, is in the 
same ""western"" location and is further from Sunrise than UMC. See id.; Reply (#841), Exhibit N, Supplemental Affidavit of Harold 
M. Ting, at Exhibit 4."
748,21," See, e.g., Morgan, 924 F.2d at 1488-89 (radiology services constitute relevant market); Oltz, 861 F.2d at 1446-48 (patient 
anesthesiological services constitute relevant market.)."
748,23," Plaintiffs also rely on the affidavit of Victor Brewer and the testimony of Donald Stewart to support their argument that the 
smaller hospitals did not compete in the same market as Sunrise. With regard to Victor Brewer's affidavit, except for his 
statement regarding physician overlap between Community and Sunrise, the statements contained therein are conclusory 
allegations insufficient to raise a question of material fact. See Errata (#822), Exhibit 112. As to Donald Stewart's testimony, 
apart from being in the context of trying to sway the Nevada legislature from further regulating the hospital industry, the clear 
gravamen of these statements was that even though the larger hospitals in Clark County participated in the same marketplace 
as the smaller hospitals, they chose not to focus their marketing resources on pursuing this share of the market. See supra at 
n.19. Furthermore, to the extent that Stewart's statements could be inferred to support Plaintiffs' conclusion that Sunrise did not 
seek to compete vigorously against the smaller hospitals in Clark County, this statement alone does not raise a material 
question of fact with regard to whether these smaller hospitals acted as a competitive constraint on the same general acute care 
hospital services offered by the larger hospitals. "
750,24," See Motion for Summary Judgement (#804), Exhibit 7, Affidavit of Barry C. Harris at Exhibit 2a; Reply (#841), Supplemental 
Affidavit of Barry C. Harris at Exhibit 1."
750,25, Id.
750,26," Reply (#841), Supplemental Affidavit of Barry C. Harris at Exhibit 1."
750,27," See Motion for Summary Judgment (#804), Exhibit 7, Affidavit of Barry C. Harris at Exhibit 4. Also included in his exhibit are 
the individual utilization rates of the various individual hospitals in Clark County. These rates are approximately 40% to 60% 
during the relevant time period."
750,28," In fact, an argument could be made that the Nevada's Certificate of Need requirements actually injured Sunrise's competitive 
position since of the 245 additional beds which were licensed between 1979 and 1988, only 16 of these were given to Sunrise. 
See Reply (#242), Supplemental Affidavit of Harold M. Ting, Exhibit Z, at Exhibit 5."
750,29," Even if this Court were to assume that the smaller hospitals in Clark County were not within the same competitive market as 
Sunrise, such a fact does not alter the conclusion that Sunrise did not have sufficient market share within Clark County to 
exercise market power during the relevant time period. Using only Desert Springs, Sunrise, Valley, and UMC as the competitive 
market, in total patient days Humana had market shares of 40% in 1985, 38% in 1986, 36% in 1987, and 36% in 1988 and in 
admissions Humana had market shares of 38% in 1985, 39% in 1986, 36% in 1987, and 35% in 1988. See Opposition (#820), 
Exhibit 107 (data relating to inpatient days and admissions for Desert Springs, Sunrise, Valley, and UMC). "
753,30," The language from the advertisements to which the Premium Payor Class refer is as follows: (1) ""Tap Dance"" commercial: ""Because we can control costs, both you and your company can save a great deal of money 
without the song and dance;"" (2) ""Mumbo Jumbo"" commercial: ""We can save you and your company money without insurance mumbo jumbo;"" (3) ""Cuts"" commercial: ""Humana is a hospital company, so we can control costs, saving employers and employees money."" Errata (#822) at 33; Reply (#841) at 35. "
754,31," Indeed, Plaintiffs indirectly acknowledge this point in their Opposition when they admit that their argument is not that 
""Defendants' fraud 'caused' Defendants to charge improper premiums."" See Errata (#822) at 224. "
756,32," In fact, Plaintiffs tacitly admit that Humana Insurance's fraudulent activity was covered by the existing Nevada statutory 
scheme when they argue that Humana Insurance ""cavalierly ignored"" these ""general legal requirements,"" thus requiring the 
Nevada legislature to pass in 1987 the more rigorous requirements of sharing discounts under AB 289. See Opposition (#822) at 
271."
756,33," At oral argument, Plaintiffs for the first time argued that since Defendants' conduct could arguably be sanctioned under 
Nevada's RICO statute, N.R.S. § 207.470, the harsh remedies afforded by the federal RICO statute cannot be seen to displace 
or supersede existing Nevada law. This Court disagrees. As recognized earlier in this Order, Plaintiffs could not pursue a Nevada RICO claim in this case given the fact that ERISA 
preempts such a claim. See supra at 22. Beyond this, it is clear that in adopting the Act, the Nevada legislature intended the 
Insurance Commissioner to have ""exclusive jurisdiction"" over fraudulent insurance practices. See N.R.S. § 686A.015. This, 
combined with the fact that the Nevada legislature specifically identified fraud on the part of the insured and not by the insurer as 
a possible predicate act under N.R.S. § 207.470, demonstrates an intent of the Nevada legislature to limit the amount of 
damages recoverable against an insurer for fraud. See N.R.S. §§ 207.360(30), 680A.200, 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.290, 
686A.291, and 686A.310. "
760,1," The Defendants named in this action are the NFL, current NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, his predecessor Pete Rozelle, 
and the following 21 organizations owning NFL franchises: The Five Smiths, Inc.; Indianapolis Colts, Inc.; Buffalo Bills, Inc., 
Chicago Bears Football Club, Inc.; Cincinnati Bengals, Inc.; Cleveland Browns, Inc.; Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Ltd.; PDB

761,2," HN1[
] The question of antitrust standing is one of law. Midwest Communications v. Minnesota Twins, Inc., 779 F.2d 444,"
761,449," (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1163, 90 L. Ed. 2d 730, 106 S. Ct. 2289 (1986). In previously denying the 
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in the instant case, this Court indicated that the Plaintiff's Complaint sufficiently alleged antitrust 
standing. 796 F. Supp. 56, 58 (D. Mass. 1992). On this Motion for Summary Judgment, this Court shall now examine the 
evidence presented by the Plaintiff to support this allegation.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 
106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986). "
762,3," The Court stresses that the improper motive inquiry is not, in and of itself, determinative of antitrust standing. See Associated 
Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 537 & n.37. As the Supreme Court has stated, HN4[
] ""the availability of the § 4 remedy to some 
person who claims its benefit is not a question of the specific intent of the conspirators."" Id. at 537 (quoting McCready, 457 U.S. 
at 479)."
762,4," While there would exist a risk of duplicate recoveries and a danger of complex apportionment in this case as between the 
Plaintiff and SMC in light of their seemingly overlapping injuries, the Court will assume that such a problematic consideration can 
be avoided here, given that the Plaintiff brings his single action for the damages suffered by both. "
763,5," The Court also finds that SMC's injury was not so ""inextricably intertwined"" with the injury that the Defendants sought to inflict 
upon William Sullivan and the professional football market as to confer standing upon him. In general, as the Supreme Court has 
indicated, HN6[
] an ""inextricably intertwined"" injury exists where the plaintiff's injury was ""a necessary step in effecting the 
ends of the alleged illegal conspiracy"" and ""the very means by which it is alleged that [the defendants] sought to achieve their 
illegal ends."" See McCready, 457 U.S. at 479-81; see also Bodie-Rickett and Assocs. v. Mars, Inc., 957 F.2d 287, 291 (6th Cir. 
1992) (to show that injury is ""inextricably intertwined,"" plaintiff must show that defendants actively manipulated or utilized him in 
order to harm competitors or participants in the relevant market); Lovett, 975 F.2d at 521 (same); Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 
Inc., 740 F.2d 739, 745-46 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. dismissed, 469 U.S. 1200 (1985) (""inextricably intertwined"" injury exists where 
Plaintiff's injury was necessary step or means employed by defendants to achieve anticompetitive ends); Crimpers Promotions 
Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 724 F.2d 290, 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1252, 82 L. Ed. 2d 841, 104 S. Ct. 
3536 (1984) (""inextricably intertwined"" injury found where boycott of plaintiff was alleged means of eliminating competition in 
relevant cable market and where plaintiff was most directly injured party). In the present case, however, the denial of stadium 
refinancing was not a necessary step in effecting and continuing a monopoly on professional football, nor was it the very means 
by which the Defendants sought to do so. It was merely a secondary consequence of the Defendants' alleged antitrust actions 
against William Sullivan. "
765,6," The Court issued an Order granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on the federal antitrust claim and declining to 
exercise supplemental jurisdiction on July 15, 1993, with this Memorandum to follow. "
785,1, The following relevant facts were taken either directly or inferentially from plaintiffs' complaint.
785,2," Plaintiffs describe defendant Major League Baseball as an unincorporated association comprised of two professional leagues, 
the American League and the National League, and their 28 professional baseball teams. In addition to Major League Baseball, plaintiffs have named the following as defendants: American League of Professional 
Baseball Clubs; National League of Professional Baseball Clubs; Office of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball; Ed 
Kuhlmann; The Orioles, Inc.; The Boston Red Sox Baseball Club; Golden West Baseball Co.; Chicago White Sox, Ltd.; 
Cleveland Indians Co.; John E. Fetzer, Inc.; Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp.; Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club; Minnesota 
Twins; New York Yankees Partnership; The Oakland Athletics Baseball Co.; Seattle Baseball, L.P.; B.R. Rangers Associates, 
Ltd.; Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Club; Atlanta National Baseball Club, Inc.; Chicago National League Ball Club, Inc.; The 
Cincinnati Reds; Houston Sports Association, Inc.; Los Angles Dodgers, Inc.; Montreal Baseball, Ltd.; Sterling Doubleday 
Enterprises, L.P.; The Phillies; Pittsburgh Associates; St. Louis National Baseball Club, Inc.; San Diego Padres Baseball 
Partnership; San Francisco Giants; Florida Marlins, Inc.; and Colorado Rockies Baseball. All defendants will be referred to collectively as ""Baseball""."
785,3," On August 28, 1992, the Partnership entered into an agreement with the City of St. Petersburg, Florida for management and 
use of the Florida Suncoast Dome. "
786,4,"  HN1[
] Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory . . 
. subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the 
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured 
in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . ."
786,42, U.S.C.A. § 1983. 
787,5," Section 1 of the Sherman Act HN2[
] provides, in pertinent part, that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . is declared to be illegal . . . ."" 15 
U.S.C.A. § 1. In pertinent part, section 2 of the Sherman Act HN3[
] provides that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among 
the several states . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 2. "
788,6," The scope and nature of this exemption are discussed at Section D.3., infra. "
789,7," HN13[
] ""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."" U.S. 
Const. art. IV, § 2, cl. 1. "
790,8," Although this testimony is not included with plaintiffs' complaint, the parties agreed at oral argument that it may be treated by 
the Court as being part of the complaint for purposes of this motion, thus avoiding the need to convert Baseball's motion under 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) into a motion for summary judgment. I note, however, that even without such an agreement, HN15[
] the 
Court may take judicial notice of matters of public record, such as Mayor Jordan's testimony, without converting a motion to 
dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Mack v. South Bay Beer Distrib., Inc., 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir. 
1986); 5A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, § 1364 (1990). "
791,9," Rule 9(b), for example, requires that averments of fraud or mistake be pled with particularity. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)."
791,10," As stated above, Baseball's motion to dismiss focuses solely upon the second element of § 1983 -- whether plaintiffs 
adequately plead that Baseball acted under color of state law by conspiring with the City of San Francisco. It challenges neither 
plaintiffs' averments that the alleged object of the conspiracy was in deprivation of plaintiffs' constitutionally protected rights, nor 
whether plaintiffs have adequately stated a cause of action for deprivation of such rights. Accordingly, I have no occasion to 
address the substantive constitutional allegations of plaintiffs' complaint."
791,11," I also conclude that plaintiffs adequately plead that Baseball acted ""under color of state law"" under the so-called ""close nexus"" 
test, which examines a government's link to the challenged action and asks whether the actions of a private entity may be 
attributed to the state. See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351 (1974). Discussed above with respect to 
plaintiffs' direct constitutional claims, HN18[
] the ""close nexus"" test requires a determination of whether the government -- the state in § 1983 litigation -- ""'has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or 
covert, that the choice [of a private entity] must in law be deemed to be that of the [government].'"" San Francisco Arts & 
Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee, 483 U.S. 522, 546 (1987)(quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 
(1982))(emphasis added). Plaintiffs allege that the City of San Francisco sought to induce the Giants not to relocate by agreeing to, in effect, indemnify 
Baseball against legal liability relating to the purchase of the Giants. Additionally, the Mayor of San Francisco has testified in 
public that he pleaded with Baseball to intervene in the sale and transfer. It certainly would be reasonable to infer from these 
allegations, which I must accept as true on a motion to dismiss, that the City of San Francisco sought to actively encourage at 
least some of the allegedly unlawful actions taken by Baseball in this case. I find such encouragement, particularly the alleged 
financial indemnification of legal liability for these actions, to be just the sort of ""significant encouragement"" necessary to deem 
the actions of Baseball to be those of the City of San Francisco. And where the challenged conduct constitutes ""state action,"" as 
it may here, that conduct is deemed to be conduct ""under color of state law and will support a suit under § 1983."" Lugar, 457 
U.S. at 934. Having based my decision to deny Baseball's motions on two alternative grounds, I do not address whether Baseball and the 
various political subdivisions where the game is played are so intertwined as to create a ""symbiotic relationship"" sufficient to 
deem Baseball's actions to have been taken under color of state law. Nor do I address whether Baseball's alleged exemption 
from state antitrust laws, in itself, makes Baseball's actions similarly attributable to the state."
791,12," I reject Baseball's eleventh hour assertion that plaintiffs have no standing to sue under § 1983 because plaintiffs were ""merely 
potential investors"" in an allegedly injured partnership, giving only the Partnership entity standing to maintain such an action. As 
sole support for this argument Baseball cites Erlich v. Glasner, 418 F.2d 226 (9th Cir. 1969), which held that a shareholder lacks "
792,," standing to bring a § 1983 action on behalf of a corporation in which he holds shares. There are two difficulties with Baseball's 
argument. First, plaintiffs here are partners in a partnership, not shareholders of a corporation. Second, and perhaps more 
important, the Ninth Circuit after Glasner held that HN19[
] ""a shareholder does have standing when he or she has been 
injured directly and independently of the corporation."" Soranno's Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan, 874 F.2d 1310, 1318 (9th Cir. 1989). 
Plaintiffs Piazza, Tirendi, and PTB plead repeatedly throughout their complaint that their own constitutional rights have been 
infringed and that they seek redress under § 1983 only for those infringements."
792,13," In particular, plaintiffs allege the following: (1) Baseball's actions ""have placed direct and indirect restraints on the purchase, 
sale, transfer and relocation of Major League Baseball teams and on competition in the purchase, sale, transfer and relocation of 
such teams, all of which directly and indirectly affect interstate commerce,"" Complaint at P 104; (2) ""Major League Baseball is an 
unreasonable and unlawful monopoly created, intended and maintained by defendants for the purpose of permitting defendant 
team owners, an intentionally select and limited group, to reap enormous profits,"" id. at P 110; and (3) Baseball has achieved 
these restraints on trade and its monopoly status by engaging in ""an unlawful combination and conspiracy . . . the substantial 
terms of which have been to eliminate all competition in the relevant market [defined as the market for American League and 
National League baseball teams], to exclude plaintiffs from participating in the relevant market, to establish monopoly control of 
the relevant market and to unreasonably restrain trade by denying the sale, transfer and relocation of the Giants to the Tampa 
Bay area,"" id. at P 111. The effect of Baseball's actions, plaintiffs allege, has been, among other things, to restrain their right to engage in the business 
of Major League Baseball, restrain their right to competitively bid on Major League Baseball teams, and cause plaintiffs to lose 
contract rights and profits. Id. at P 112."
792,14," For a concise discussion of the distinction between a per se violation of the Sherman Act and the so-called rule of reason 
analysis applicable to resolution of most Sherman Act cases, see Business Electric Corp. v. Sharp Electric Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 
723-24 (1988). Aside from determining whether plaintiffs must allege a loss of competition in relevant markets, which plaintiffs 
readily concede they must do, the distinction is not relevant to Baseball's motion to dismiss. "
793,15," Wirtz also stands for the proposition that HN21[
] a relevant product market may be defined as a market for which the 
parties compete, as opposed to one in which they compete. Wirtz, 870 F.2d at 531 (citing Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 
410 U.S. 366, 369 (1973)). Thus a party may prevail under the Sherman Act if it was unlawfully excluded from a market, such as 
the market identified in Wirtz as the market for presentation of live basketball in Chicago, even if that party never met, nor 
intended to meet, the defendants in direct competition within that market. Plaintiffs argue here that they were competing with 
others outside Major League Baseball to join Major League Baseball and that Wirtz requires recognition that Baseball's alleged 
interference with that competition could be actionable under the Sherman Act. I agree. Plaintiffs also argue that this case may fall into the exception noted by the Third Circuit in Mid-South Grizzlies (that intra-league 
competition between certain teams for ticket-purchasers, concessions, etc. conceivably may exist). Plaintiffs assert that if their 
antitrust claim survives Baseball's motion to dismiss, they will elicit evidence during discovery that defendant Florida Marlins, Inc. 
(the ""Marlins"") -- owner of a National League expansion team located in Miami, Florida -- colluded unlawfully with unnamed 
others to keep the Giants out of Florida in an effort to preserve the Marlins' alleged monopoly in that state over Major League 
Baseball television rights, fans, and concessions. To buttress this assertion, which does not appear in their complaint, plaintiffs 
have submitted several copies of newspaper articles that speculate or charge that the owner of the Marlins, Wayne Huizenga, 
engaged in such collusion. Although I am persuaded conceptually by plaintiffs' theory, I cannot base my holding upon it because 
their complaint does not even allude to such a scheme, nor do plaintiffs define as a relevant product market the market for 
baseball fans, television rights and concessions in the State of Florida. I note in this regard that plaintiffs have not filed for leave 
to amend their complaint to pursue such a theory."
793,16," Similarly distinguishable are Seattle Totems Hockey Club, Inc. v. National Hockey League, 783 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 479 U.S. 932 (1986), and Levin v. National Basketball Ass'n, 385 F. Supp. 149 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). Unlike the instant case 
but similar to Mid-South Grizzlies, Seattle Totems was an antitrust action arising from an unsuccessful attempt by the plaintiff in 
that case to join the National Hockey League (""NHL"") through the creation of a franchise. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district "
794,," court's dismissal of the plaintiff's Sherman Act claim in part because the plaintiffs sought to join the NHL rather than compete 
with it. Seattle Totems is thus distinguishable because competition in the markets for ownership of existing franchises or 
participation in the NHL was not at issue. Closer to the facts in this case, Levin involved an antitrust action filed by plaintiffs who sought to purchase an existing 
professional sports franchise -- the Boston Celtics basketball team. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the 
defendants in that case because, inter alia, the plaintiffs wanted to join the National Basketball Association rather than compete 
with it. The district court's opinion, however, gives no indication that either the plaintiffs asserted or that the court considered a 
claim that competition had been restrained in the markets for professional basketball teams or for participation in professional 
basketball. (I also note in passing that the Third Circuit in Mid-South Grizzlies called into question the suggestion in Levin that 
there could never be competition among league members. See Mid-South Grizzlies, 720 F.2d at 787 n.9.) "
795,17," Compare Klebanow v. New York Produce Exchange, 344 F.2d 294 (2d Cir. 1965)(""When business is conducted by a 
partnership, the [Clayton Act] views the partnership rather than a partner as the person injured."") with Kauffman, 434 F.2d at 733 
(""Nowhere . . . do we find authority for the proposition that [a shareholder is vested in a share of his corporation's right to sue]. 
To accept this would be to convert an orthodox corporate structure to a general partnership or joint venture with each participant 
a principal and agent for the others."") "
797,18," See Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 93 (S.D. Cal. 1951), aff'd without opinion, 200 F.2d 198 (9th Cir. 
1952); Kowalski v. Chandler, 202 F.2d 413 (6th Cir. 1953); Corbett v. Chandler, 202 F.2d 428 (6th Cir. 1953)."
797,19," The ""reserve system"" includes the reserve clause and Major League Baseball rules designed to complement the clause in 
confining the player to the club that has him under contract and otherwise providing contract uniformity. See Flood, 407 U.S. at 
259 n.1. "
799,20," The Finley court identified the following two references to the reserve clause in Flood: For the third time in 50 years the Court is asked specifically to rule that professional baseball's reserve system is within the 
reach of the federal antitrust laws. Finley, 569 F.2d at 540 n.48 (quoting Flood, 407 U.S. at 259). With its reserve system enjoying exemption from the federal antitrust laws, baseball is, in a very distinct sense, an 
exception and an anomaly. Id. (quoting Flood, 407 U.S. at 282). "
800,21," Radovich later made clear that this rule applied only to the business of organized baseball, prohibiting its application to other 
professional sports. See Radovich, 352 U.S. at 450."
800,22," Baseball cites the following decisions, among others, in support of its view: Professional Baseball Schools & Clubs, Inc. v.

reasoning remains vital. "
802,25," One might also view the relevant market more narrowly as the market for the purchase and transfer of the Giants only, where 
there was but one seller, Robert Lurie, constituting a monopoly, with the buyer group including only those interested in the 
Giants, as opposed to other professional baseball teams. On a motion to dismiss, I must view the relevant market in the manner 
most favorable to plaintiffs."
802,26," Postema held that the Federal Baseball exemption does not apply to baseball's employment relationships with non-players 
such as umpires because such relationships ""are not a unique characteristic or need of the game."" Id. at 1489. But see Salerno 
v. American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 429 F.2d 1003 (2d Cir. 1970)(holding that employment relations with 
umpires are within the exemption), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1001 (1971). Postema chose not to follow Salerno because it was 
decided before ""Flood's apparent endorsement of a limited view of the exemption."" Postema, 799 F. Supp. at 1475. "

827,2,"  Similarly, the analyses set forth in Monsanto and Matsushita do not apply when a plaintiff has offered direct evidence of 
concerted action. Arnold Pontiac-GMC, Inc. v. Budd Baer, Inc., 826 F.2d 1335, 1338 (3d Cir. 1987). See also In re 
Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 906 F.2d 432, 441 (9th Cir. 1990)."
827,3,"  Our review does not include consideration of evidence which was the subject of the three pending motions to supplement 
the record. Nor will we consider citations to evidence in F. Schumacher & Co.'s brief which was not of record before the 
district court."
827,4,"  In the nomenclature of the marketplace, these 800-number dealers are ""free-riders,"" who reduce or eliminate service to 
create price competition but who benefit from services such as wallpaper sample books, salesperson advice and showroom 
displays paid for and provided by other, full-service retailers. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 
55, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977); Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1376-77 
(3d Cir. 1992). "
828,5,"  We may, of course, consider evidence of activity necessitating the entry of the consent decree, as well as the terms of the 
consent decree itself, as part of the overall picture, or potential evidence of a pattern of conduct. See Big Apple BMW, 974 
F.2d at 1361; cf.  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 
(1962). "
830,6,"  FSC and NDPA argue that these articles constitute inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiffs respond that the articles are admissible 
as statements of NDPA, having been published in its own publications. See HN15[
] Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (statements are not hearsay if they are offered against a party and are statements of which the party has ""manifested his adoption or 
belief in its truth""). We agree: an employee of NDPA had to have written these articles, which were adopted by NDPA when 
it published them in Decorating Retailer and Wallcovering Industry News. Wells' statements as reflected in the articles are, 
therefore, admissible. "
831,7,"  Their amended complaint indicates that plaintiffs originally were concerned about two additional FSC policies: FSC's failure 
to discuss cooperative advertising possibilities with 800-number dealers though it did so with conventional retailers, and 
FSC's charging state sales tax on drop shipments. These policies, however, are not subjects of this appeal."
831,8,"  NDPA and FSC argue that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court failed to enter a judgment on a 
separate document in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and had not yet awarded costs in 
accordance with Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
832,," In Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 55 L. Ed. 2d 357, 98 S. Ct. 1117 (1978) (per curiam), however, the Supreme 
Court recognized that the rules of civil procedure requiring entry of judgment on a separate document should be interpreted 
in a common-sense fashion. ""HN16[
] If, by error, a separate judgment is not filed before a party appeals, nothing but 
delay would flow from requiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal."" Mallis, 435 U.S. at 385-86. See also 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Assoc., 660 F.2d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1981). 
The district court's failure to enter judgment in accordance with the dictates of Rule 58 appears to stem from oversight. No 
other plausible suggestion has been advanced. Thus, we reject this jurisdictional argument. As to costs, we note that the parties' stipulation of settlement, which disposed of those counts as to which the district court 
had not granted summary judgment and which was entered as an order by the district court, provided that each party was 
to bear its own costs, thus implicitly if not actually resolving any Rule 54(d) issue. "
833,9,"  It would be incorrect to require an official board resolution, or other officially sanctioned activity, to impose liability on NDPA. 
Recognizing that perpetrators of antitrust violations are often sophisticated businessmen, courts regularly permit 
agreements to be shown by circumstantial evidence. See Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1364; Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. 
Paramount Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540-41, 98 L. Ed. 273, 74 S. Ct. 257 (1954)."
833,10,"  Judge Boudin notes that the Supreme Court in Hydrolevel viewed ASME as an ""extra-governmental agency"" regulating its 
own industry.  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 570, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 
102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982). See M. Boudin, Antitrust Doctrine and the Sway of Metaphor, 75 Geo. L. J. 395, 417 (1986). 
Indeed, Hydrolevel and many other trade association cases have focused on this role and on associations' standard-setting 
or industry-regulating activities. See e.g.  Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 
U.S. 284, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985); Moore v. Boating Industry Assoc., 819 F.2d 693 (7th Cir. 1987). See 
generally ABA Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments 86-91 (3d ed. 1992). Notably, the case before us does not 
involve standard-setting or industry-regulating activity on NDPA's part. "
835,11,"  Citing Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988), the 
dissent contends that the teachings of Monsanto do not apply to a so-called ""hybrid case,"" in which joint coercive action by 
dealers allegedly results in a manufacturer's acting to injure other dealers. See Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 730 n.4. 
Such a case (of which the one before us is an example) combines elements of horizontal and vertical conspiracies; this 
may affect the decision of whether a per se or a rule of reason standard will apply when judging liability, cf.  Pennsylvania 
Dental Assoc. v. Medical Service Assoc. of Pennsylvania, 745 F.2d 248, 259 (3d Cir. 1984), but it does not necessarily "
836,," follow that the Monsanto teachings do not apply. We believe that the Court's footnote in Business Electronics merely states 
that a restraint is termed horizontal or vertical based upon the type of agreement reached, rather than its effects. "
843,12," Neither the parties, the majority, nor my own research has uncovered any case that has dealt with the specific issue involved 
here. "
844,13," One commentator has argued that the Court's decision in Hydrolevel is properly characterized as a metaphor for protecting 
due process. When a trade association, a group that functions privately to regulate an industry, has power substantially to affect 
its market, actions of its agents that tend to exclude and harm competitors essentially deprive those competitors of any rights to 
fair representation in industry regulation. See Michael Boudin, Antitrust Doctrine and the Sway of Metaphor, 75 Geo. L.J. 395, 
417-18 (1986) (""The failure of a powerful trade association or other organization to protect competitors should be remedied, by 
analogy to representation in government, by giving those excluded a right to participate in the group or, in the alternative, a right 
fairly to be represented by those in charge of the group.""). The application of such a due process metaphor to the present case 
suggests that the actions of NDPA's officers and officials may be aimed at improperly ostracizing and excluding 800 number 
dealers from decisions that will control the wallcovering industry. Because of this capacity of a trade association to impose 
exclusionary standards on engaging in a particular business or industry, it is perhaps more critical, when there has been a "
845,," showing that attempted regulation by the association may have this propensity to eliminate non-participating competitors, that 
the court permit a full consideration of those allegations by the finder of fact. "
846,14," I also note that, as will be discussed in my analysis of Count II, there is evidence of a conspiracy between the NDPA and FSC. 
See infra at    [typescript at 18-20]. This evidence provides a basis for characterizing FSC as a co-conspirator of the NDPA 
sufficient to survive summary judgment on Count I, even under the majority's analysis of section I combination liability. "
855,1," No plaintiff class is currently certified. All parties have agreed to a stay of plaintiffs' motion for class certification pending 
resolution of defendants' motion to dismiss. "
857,2," Plaintiffs' sweeping litigation strategy is not confined to their complaint. Plaintiffs originally filed with this Court a two volume, 
357 page single-spaced Memorandum In Support Of Their Objection To Defendants' 12(b)(6) Motion To Dismiss. This Court 
then directed plaintiffs to re-submit a memorandum of law not more than 60 double-spaced pages. Plaintiffs only superficially 
complied with the Court's instructions. While they did file a 60 page abbreviated memorandum, plaintiffs repeatedly cross-
reference crucial material in the abbreviated memorandum to voluminous passages contained in the original 357 page brief. In 
the interests of judicial economy, this Court has overlooked plaintiffs' mishandling of this motion and considered arguments 
contained in both the original and abbreviated filings."
857,3," Defendants also contend that they have antitrust immunity from suit based upon three separate grounds: (1) the McCarran-
Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-15, which provides an antitrust exemption for the ""business of insurance""; (2) the so-called 
""state-action"" doctrine, which offers immunity for actions taken by state government and certain private actors; and (3) the Local 
Government Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36, which bars antitrust damage actions against local governments, including 
""special function governmental units established by State law in one or more States."" Because I hold that plaintiffs have failed to 
state a valid claim under either § 1 or § 2 of the Sherman Act, there is no need to address these defenses. "
859,4," In theory, it is also possible to prove that a tying arrangement violates § 1 of the Sherman Act under the rule of reason. Under 
the rule of reason -- unlike the per se test -- a plaintiff bringing a tying claim ""has the burden of proving that the [challenged 
action] violated the Sherman Act because it unreasonably restrained competition."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 29. The First 
Circuit has interpreted this requirement to mean that a plaintiff cannot show a tying violation in the absence of the per se rules 
unless the tie's anticompetitive effects outweigh its legitimate business justifications.  Grappone, 858 F.2d at 799. In the current action, plaintiffs do not articulate a rule of reason challenge. Nor do they allege sufficient facts in the amended 
complaint that point to significant anticompetitive effects in any tied product market. Thus, I conclude that plaintiffs have failed to 
state a rule of reason tying claim."
859,5," Plaintiffs argue that the health insurance requirement precludes some students from employing ""self-insurance."" Abbreviated 
Memorandum at 24. If students do not wish to purchase any insurance, however, the university's mandate lacks anticompetitive 
consequences. ""When a purchaser is 'forced' to buy a product he would not have otherwise bought even from another seller in "
860,," the tied-product market, there can be no adverse impact on competition because no portion of the market which would otherwise 
have been available to other sellers has been foreclosed. "" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 16. See also Grappone, 858 F.2d at 
799."
860,6," Plaintiffs do suggest in passing, however, that ""before the prospective student enrolls at any university, URI has market power 
regarding that prospective student if s/he is not admitted anywhere else or cannot afford to go anywhere else, or, lacks a non-
URI option for any other reason."" Plaintiff's Original Memorandum at 161 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs do not expand upon 
this highly speculative theory of market power, and thus I believe it merits no attention from the Court. "
861,7," Also critical to the Supreme Court's denial of summary judgement on the § 1 tying claims was evidence ""that Kodak's control 
over the parts market has excluded service competition, boosted service prices and forced unwilling consumption of Kodak 
service."" 112 S. Ct. at 2081. "
862,8," Both plaintiffs and defendants have characterized these § 2 claims as ""attempted monopolization"" rather than conspiracy to 
monopolize. In my view, conspiracy to monopolize is a better label because the claims allege a conspiracy between two entities 
-- URI and LINA. In any case, the choice of category is not critical to the outcome. As discussed below, plaintiffs have failed to 
allege a specific intent to monopolize in the relevant market -- an essential element for both attempted monopolization and 
conspiracy to monopolize. Compare Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan 122 L. Ed. 2d 247,    U.S.   , 113 S. Ct. 884, 890-892 
(1993) (elements of attempted monopolization) with Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1576 (11th Cir. 
1991) (elements of conspiracy to monopolize) and Volvo North America Corp. v. Men's Int'l Professional Tennis Council, 857 
F.2d 55, 74 (2nd Cir. 1988) (same). Moreover, conspiracy to monopolize might be viewed as an easier claim to plead than 
attempted monopolization because the plaintiff need not address the element of a ""dangerous probability of success"" in the 
market. ABA, Antitrust Law Developments at 272. "
863,9," This position is supported by one pre-Kodak U.S. District Court case from New York, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Adler, 
1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1146, 1988-1 Trade Cases P 67,907 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). In that case, the defendant, Dr. Adler, brought a § 
2 antitrust counterclaim alleging that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company sought to limit any competition that could affect its 
alleged monopoly of group medical insurance for New York State employees. Specifically, Adler charged that Metropolitan Life 
attempted to deprive members of the insurance plan of the physician of their choice solely to enhance profits and lower costs. 
1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1146, at *10. Adler contended that the relevant market for this monopolization allegation was limited to 
the employees of New York State covered by the plaintiffs' health insurance plans. Id. at *11-12. The Court dismissed the counterclaim. It found, among other things, that Adler had failed to plead an appropriate market 
definition. The Court wrote: "". . . Dr. Adler attempts to allege a monopoly simply by definition of the market. Surely the relevant 
market cannot be those New York State employees who have opted to subscribe to Metropolitan's health insurance. In such a 
case, there could be no finding other than one of monopoly."" Id. at *12. "
870,1, It should be noted that SMIC has not been served in this case.
870,2," SMIC and Samick (USA) will collectively be referred to as the ""Samick defendants""."
870,3," Hyundai and Hyundai (USA) will collectively be referred to as the ""Hyundai defendants""."
870,4," Although all the documentary evidence is to the contrary, plaintiffs suggest that the Hyundai defendants did not really attempt 
to convince the Samick defendants to continue supplying plaintiffs. Rather, plaintiffs speculate that the two groups of defendants 
engaged in a ""good cop/bad cop"" charade, whereby the Hyundai defendants only pretended to try to convince SMIC to continue 
supplying plaintiffs. "
871,5," § 1 of the Sherman Act makes illegal ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of 
trade or commerce. . ."""
871,6," The only actionable agreement that plaintiffs could assert involving the Hyundai defendants would be between the Hyundai 
defendants collectively and the Samick defendants. As Hyundai (USA) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyundai, the Hyundai 
defendants are legally incapable of conspiring with each other for the purposes of § 1. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence 
Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771-77, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984) (because corporate parents and their wholly owned 
subsidiaries have ""a complete unity of interest. . . . the very notion of an 'agreement' in Sherman Act terms between a parent and 
wholly owned subsidiary lacks meaning""). Moreover, the same rationale that prevents a parent and wholly owned subsidiary from conspiring with each other for the 
purposes of the antitrust laws, also prevents Samick (USA) from conspiring with SMIC. Although SMIC only owns 80% of 
Samick (USA), the remaining 20% is controlled by one of its managing directors. Under these facts, this Court concludes that 
there is ""a complete unity of interest"" between SMIC and Samick USA making an agreement between them meaningless in 
Sherman Act terms."
871,7," The Samick defendants argue that because the complaint alleges a vertical restriction on trade, the rule of reason is the proper 
analysis to be applied to this case. Although the recent trend in antitrust law favors rule of reason analysis over the per se 
approach, the Supreme Court has not adopted the rule of reason in the context of vertical price-fixing schemes. Rather, the 
Supreme Court continues to hold that vertical price-fixing is per se illegal. "
872,," Moreover, Samick's reliance on cases that suggest that vertical non-price-fixing restraints should be analyzed under the rule of 
reason is misplaced. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). 
Here, plaintiffs allege a price-fixing scheme. In Sylvania, the plaintiffs claimed that Sylvania violated § 1 ""by entering into and 
enforcing franchise agreements that prohibited the sale of Sylvania products other than from specified locations."" Id. at 40. Thus, 
the plaintiffs in Sylvania did not allege, as plaintiffs do here, that the defendants entered into price-fixing agreements."
872,8," This Court is uncertain whether it was to Hyundai's economic benefit to continue supplying pianos to plaintiffs. Because 
Hyundai competed against plaintiffs at the wholesale level, plaintiffs' termination as a distributor may have benefited Hyundai. "
873,9," Plaintiffs argue that any agreement between the Hyundai defendants and the Samick defendants to boycott plaintiffs should be 
viewed as horizontal. Plaintiffs' theory evidently is that goods made by the same manufacturer compete ""horizontally"" if they bear 
different trade names and are sold by different distributors. Plaintiffs offer no case law to support this characterization. In Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338, 99 S. Ct. 340 (1978), the 
defendant whirlpool manufactured vacuum cleaners that were sold by the plaintiff under the brand name ""whirlpool"" and sold by 
Sears, another distributor, under the brand name ""Kenmore."" The plaintiff argued that this market structure rendered the 
competition between Sears and the plaintiff ""horizontal,"" because as a result of the plaintiff's termination, ""competition of both an 
interbrand and intrabrand nature was eliminated."" Id. at 131 n.6. The Second Circuit, however, rejected this argument, holding 
that the existence of multiple brands sold by different distributors ""does not ipso facto, convert this case into a horizontal 
conspiracy warranting per se treatment."" Id. at 131. Likewise, the existence of multiple trade names here does not transform the 
vertical nature of this case. This is especially so where the purported agreement is between the manufacturer of goods and 
another distributor. "
876,10," Plaintiffs' argument that the Samick defendants should be held liable for breach of warranty because they had at some point 
agreed to correct certain defects as a courtesy is unavailing. Plaintiffs do not represent that the Samick defendants in any way 
communicated to them their intention to be held liable for the defects. Moreover, plaintiffs have not provided this Court with any 
authority that New York would impose liability on a non-seller manufacturer solely because that manufacturer agreed as a 
courtesy to correct defects in its products. "
882,1, Currently codified at 740 ILCS 10/3(1)-10/3(4) (Smith-Hurd 1993). 
883,2, Currently codified at 815 ILCS 505/1-505/12 (1993). 
884,3," The ""rule of reason"" requires analysis of the market said to be harmed by the violation and the effects of the competitive 
restriction on that market. Consequently, such harm is a necessary element of an antitrust claim based on the ""rule of reason"". "
887,4," Defendants also complain that Plaintiffs have named the Appraisal Institute as both a person and an enterprise with respect to 
their section 1962(c) claim. Such is prohibited in Haroco v. American Nat'l Bank & Trust of Chicago, 747 F.2d 384, 400 (7th Cir. 
1984), aff'd, 473 U.S. 606, 87 L. Ed. 2d 437, 105 S. Ct. 3291 (1985). Plaintiffs correctly point out that they do not claim that the 
Institute violated section 1962(c) in their complaint. While this fact requires the rejection of this element of Defendants argument, 
it also demonstrates the confusion nature of the manner in which Plaintiffs have made their RICO claims. Plaintiffs' complaint contains at least two other infirmities. First, it fails to make allegations regarding the management of any 
enterprise as required by Reves v. Ernst & Young,     U.S.    , 113 S. Ct. 1163 (1993). Second, it fails to describe the ""continuity 
of structure and personality"" or ""structure, purpose, function and course of conduct"" of the alleged association-in-fact. See 
O'Rear v. American Family Life Assurance Co., 139 F.R.D. 418, 422 (M.D. Fla. 1991) (demonstrating means of pleading the 
existence of an enterprise). "
888,5," Defendants' also claim that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(g) relating to special damages. 
Since Plaintiffs do not specify their defamation theory and specify their damages, the Court does not further discuss this issue. "
916,1," In addition to AFW, CA named as defendants Richard Yeager, AFW's president, and Jerome C. Dayton, AFW's vice-president. 
CA dismissed its claims against these individuals in December, 1991."
916,2," At various times, both sides to this dispute moved for the entry of sanctions. AFW also moved to add a counterclaim based on 
CA's alleged violation of the protective order. Judge Carrigan deferred these motions until after trial but apparently advised the 
parties they could file independent suits for violation of the protective order. They did. See Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. 
Flagship Group, No. 92-K-1660; American Fundware, Inc. v. Computer Assocs, Int'l, Inc., No. 92-K-1185. On April 28, 1993, the 
parties stipulated to the dismissal of these suits and the withdrawal of any motions for sanctions pending in this case. "
918,3," On the other hand, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine has been advocated as a first-line defense to ""SLAPP"" suits, an acronym 
coined by University of Denver Professors Penelope Canan and George Pring for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public 
Participation. See generally Thomas A. Waldman, Comment, SLAPP Suits: Weaknesses in First Amendment Law and in the 
Court's Responses to Frivolous Litigation, 39 UCLA L. Rev. 979 (April 1992). "
920,4," Moreover, even if the ""work for hire"" concept applies in trade secret misappropriation cases, these deposition excerpts do not 
conclusively establish whether the persons that SPO hired to do ""grunt coding"" and other programming were employees or 
independent contractors. See Community for Creative Non-Violence, 490 U.S. at 751-52 (listing factors court must consider to 
determine whether a hired party is an employee). Assuming they were independent contractors, SPO does not necessarily lose 
all ownership in the SPO programs. See id. at 738, 753 HN9[
] (employer of independent contractor owns copyright in specially 
commissioned work and joint copyright in work merged into inseparable parts of a unitary whole.)"
920,5," CA argues that the same provisions were contained in all of its agreements with other licensees, and that the licensees were 
required to treat the SPO programs as proprietary and confidential. CA fails to support this contention with reference to any facts 
of record. "
923,6," AFW argues that this statute does not apply because CA's cause of action accrued before its effective date. HN19[
] Under the common law ""discovery rule"" and the statute codifying it, see Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 13-80-108(6), -108(8) (1987), CA's contract 
and tort claims accrued when it discovered or should have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence the breach of 
contract or tortious conduct giving rise to its claims. Applying the rule to this case, CA's cause of action accrued in the fall of 
1986, when it was able to make an actual comparison of its and AFW's code, leading it to believe that plagiarism had occurred. 
AFW's contention that this rule was not adopted as to contract or tort cases until July 1, 1987, after this case was filed, is simply 
incorrect. See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-80-108 (1986 Supp.). "
925,7," CA raised four additional issues in its motion for limine. First, CA requested that evidence of either party's violation of the 
protective order be disallowed. This request is moot in light of the stipulation regarding alleged violations of the protective order 
filed April 20, 1993. Second, CA requested I limit AFW from asserting at trial that CA is not the owner of all right, title and interest of any assets 
transferred to it from SPO. At the hearing on these motions, AFW agreed that it will not challenge the ""chain of title"" of these 
assets. In other words, AFW concedes that CA received whatever assets SPO had. Third, CA sought an order limiting evidence of its settlement with the individual defendants in this case. The parties indicated in 
their briefs and at the hearing that there is no disagreement that the terms of CA's settlement are not admissible. Fourth, CA has withdrawn its request that it be entitled to a presumption that the versions of the PC-Fund and Fundware 
programs that AFW destroyed would have demonstrated that AFW copied CA's code and concedes that issue should be 
addressed at the jury instruction conference."
925,8," AFW also sought to preclude CA's introduction of any charts prepared by its witness, James Schenck, included as Exhibits 
292-295 to the deposition of John O'Brien. At the hearing on these motions, AFW withdrew this request. "
939,1," Thus, because appellee has immunity from the antitrust cause of action alleged by appellants, we need not address the other 
factors which determine antitrust standing. See Associated Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. California State Counsel of Carpenters, 459 
U.S. 519, 529, 103 S. Ct. 897, 903, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). "
967,1," Plaintiffs originally alleged pendent state law claims alleging due process violations, breach of contract, and, in their First 
Amendment to Complaint, tortious interference with business relationships. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed these claims in a 
Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, dated January 25, 1993."
967,2," Defendants implicitly concede that a dispute of fact exists with respect to a number of issues, such as the relevant geographic 
and product markets and the connection of the challenged conduct with interstate commerce. Therefore, for purposes of the 
instant motion, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court accepts as correct Plaintiffs' 
assertions with respect to these issues. Nevertheless, because of the lack of any dispute of material fact on the dispositive 
issues discussed below, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. "
968,3," Plaintiff's allege that the relevant geographic market is the three zip code area encompassing Morganton, Glen Alpine, and 
Drexel. Because the parties have not suggested any changes in the radiology market in Glen Alpine and Drexel, the remainder 
of this opinion generally refers only to Morganton for the sake of simplicity."
968,4," During the tenures of both Blue Ridge and PMI, other radiologists occasionally provided radiology services at the Hospital on a 
temporary ""locum tenens"" basis when necessary to cover for the full-time radiologists. Antley Depo. (7/13/92) at 221; Mull Depo. 
(8/20/92) at 79. "
970,5," When Blue Ridge opened its outpatient radiology center, it employed at least one technologist who had previously been 
employed by Grace Hospital. Antley Depo. (5/4/92) at 236-37. "
971,6," Beginning in late February 1993, the Blue Ridge facility began to offer MRI on a one-day-per-week basis to patients in 
Morganton pursuant to an arrangement with a mobile MRI company. Howerton Decl. 27."
971,7," Until January 1992, patients receiving mammography screens were charged one fee which was divided between the Hospital 
and the physicians. Hord Depo. (10/8/91) at 37. Since that time, the Hospital and PMI have billed separately for their respective 
services. Wilson Aff. at 6."
971,8," There are also a number of other providers of outpatient technical and professional radiology services in Burke County, 
specifically: Morganton Family Practice, Dr. Anderson, two orthopedists (Drs. Glugover and Saunders), Dr. Shah-Khan, and the 
radiology group at Valdese General Hospital. Antley Depo. (5/4/92) at 263-64; Howerton Depo. (8/17-19/92) at 202-06. Two 
years after the opening of the Blue Ridge outpatient facility, all of these providers still supplied outpatient radiology services. 
Antley Depo. (5/4/92) at 264. In addition, after the opening of the Blue Ridge outpatient facility, two other physicians have 
obtained radiology equipment and now provide technical radiology services. Id. "
972,9," This calculation does not include the procedures performed by the office-based providers of radiology services, which, if 
included, would further reduce Grace's market share. "
974,10," ""Antitrust standing to sue is at the center of all antitrust law and policy. It is not a mere technicality."" HyPoint Technology, Inc. 
v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 949 F.2d 874, 877 (6th Cir. 1991). "
976,11," See generally III P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 738a, 738c (1978) (because ""the effects upon a rival would usually be 
very speculative,"" disparagement claims should ""presumptively be ignored,"" and should be recognized only where there exists 
""cumulative proof that the representations were clearly false, clearly material, clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance, made 
to buyers without knowledge of the subject matter, continued for prolonged periods, and not readily susceptible of neutralization 
or other offset by rivals""); Abcor, 916 F.2d at 931 (to allow federal antitrust claims based upon allegations of disparagement and 
other similar allegations of ""unfair competition,"" would be contrary to the intent of the antitrust laws). "
977,12," See Leffler Decl. 26 (stating that a number of physician declarations ""indicate that these doctors' choice of radiologist to read 
their outpatient films and their choice of outpatient center have been influenced by the exclusion of Blue Ridge from Grace""); 
Leffler Decl. 27 (stating that ""the referring physicians' choice of outpatient radiology supplier has been influenced by the 
exclusionary contract""); Leffler Decl. 28 (stating that ""where a consumer in a market, contrary to his preference is required to pay 
a higher price for a lower quality product, the presence of anti-competitive impact in the market is beyond doubt"")."
977,13," Ellison Depo. at 40; Madison Depo. at 20, 33-34. With respect to the physician declarations cited in support of this proposition 
in paragraph 26 of Dr. Leffler's Declaration, only two even mention the Hospital's outpatient services, and these two merely state 
that if there were no exclusive contract, ""I would have an alternative from which to choose a radiologist … with respect to … 
outpatient examinations, which I sometimes prefer to have done at the hospital."" Dellinger Decl. 8 (emphasis added); Deekens 
Decl. 6. The declarations do not state that their choice to have occasional outpatient radiology work done at the Hospital has 
been influenced in any way by the exclusive contract for inpatient radiology services, or by any other conduct by the Hospital."
977,14," See Leffler Decl. 22 (""According to Dr. Howerton, a differentially large portion of the clinic's referrals come from hospital 
colleagues with whom Blue Ridge has developed an ongoing relationship during Dr. Howerton's 27 year tenure at Grace…. 
Therefore, as physicians retire from the Grace staff and are replaced by new physicians who have no historical relationship with 
Blue Ridge, the revenues at the clinic will continue their decline""); Leffler Decl. 25 (""According to Richard Dorson of the 
American College of Radiology, referrals to freestanding outpatient center such as Blue Ridge will be reduced when the 
radiologists staffing the outpatient center 'are unable to establish a regular, full service relationship with referring doctors'""); 
Leffler Decl. 25 (""the ability to establish a working relationship and demonstrate one's skill by performing the complex radiology 
procedures frequently required of inpatients generates outpatient referrals"")."
977,15," Dr. Howerton states that Blue Ridge ""does not receive very many referrals from the newer members of the medical staff who 
have joined since 1990."" Howerton Aff. 30. This statement, however, simply reflects the fact that 52 non-radiologist physicians 
were on the active staff prior to the termination of Plaintiffs' contract, and that only 9 non-radiologist physicians have since joined 
the active staff. Eisenstadt Depo., Ex. 5. Dr. Howerton does not state that he receives a higher percentage of the patients of 
long-established physicians than he does from newer physicians, and therefore, this testimony does not support Dr. Leffler's 
conclusion that Blue Ridge's revenues will ""continue"" to decline. Mr. Dorson's affidavit, upon which Dr. Leffler also relies, states that where radiologists are unable to serve inpatients, he ""would 
expect the number of referrals to the outpatient facility [operated by the radiologists] to decrease significantly because these 
radiologists would be unable to establish a regular, full service relationship with the referring physicians."" Dorson Aff. at 5. As "
978,," noted above, however, Dr. Dorson's expectations are contradicted by the record evidence that referrals have increased, and 
therefore, his testimony, like that of Dr. Leffler's, is insufficient to demonstrate causal antitrust injury."
978,16," Throughout discovery, the experts of both Plaintiffs and Defendants experts calculated market shares based on the number of 
procedures performed at Blue Ridge. See, e.g., Kennedy Depo., Ex. 5, Ex. 32; Eisenstadt Depo. Ex. 1, Ex. IV. Only in his 
affidavit submitted with Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition did Plaintiffs' expert change the basis of his calculations to total 
revenues."
978,17," As noted in the Findings of Fact, the higher charges at Grace Hospital reflect the fact that Grace Hospital has significantly 
higher overhead costs -- principally attributable to the fact that it is open 7 days per week, 24 hours per day and handles "
979,," emergency room patients. See Shull Depo. (11/19/92) at 35. Blue Ridge is open five days per week and closes at 5:30 p.m. See 
Antley Depo. (12/12/92) at 3-4."
979,18," See also Olympia Equip., 797 F.2d at 375 (""A monopolist has … no duty to extend a helping hand to new entrants;"" ""the lawful 
monopolist should be free to compete like everyone else; otherwise the antitrust laws would be holding an umbrella over 
inefficient competitors""); McKenzie v. Mercy Hosp. of Independence Kansas, 854 F.2d 365, 368 (10th Cir. 1988) (holding that 
hospital not liable under Section 2 for denying access to plaintiff physician because ""a competitor in a market is free to choose 
the parties to whom it will offer its products or services""); Twin Labs., Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 568 (2d Cir. 
1990) (the antitrust laws do ""not require one competitor to give another a break just because failing to do so offends notions of 
fair play"")."
979,19," As one of the necessary elements of an essential facilities claim, a plaintiff must prove an ""inability practically or reasonably to 
duplicate the essential facility."" Advanced Health-Care, 910 F.2d at 150 (citation omitted). "
980,20," In Advanced Health-Care, the court was ruling on the propriety of the District Court's dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 
and therefore, the court accepted the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint as true. 910 F.2d at 143."
980,21," As noted in the discussion of antitrust injury, there is not even any evidence that lack of access to the Hospital has adversely 
affected Blue Ridge in the outpatient market."
980,22," Likewise inapposite is the decision in Aspen Skiing Co., 472 U.S. at 585, in which the defendant terminated a 16-year-old 
cooperative venture with plaintiff, a competing ski area operator, which was indispensable to competition. In the present case, 
there is no evidence that access to the Hospital is indispensable to outpatient competition. Moreover, the Hospital and Blue 
Ridge were not competitors prior to the opening of the Blue Ridge outpatient facility when plaintiffs had access to the Hospital, 
and therefore there was never any such longstanding cooperative agreement between competitors. Antley Depo. (5/4/92) at 
283."

982,24," Antley Depo. (7/13/92) at 31-32, 39; Antley Depo. Ex. 1; Leffler Depo. (12/2-4/92) at 302."
982,25," The mere fact that the PMI contract has a four-year term with no terminable-at-will clause does not constitute evidence of a 
new insulation from competitive pressures, where, as here, it is clear that Plaintiffs were similarly insulated while at the Hospital. 
Howerton Depo. (12/18/92 P.M.) at 30-31. (when setting prices, Dr. Howerton never considered the possibility that other 
radiologists might be brought into the hospital to compete); Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 31 (""without a showing of actual 
adverse effect on competition, respondent cannot make out a case under the antitrust laws"") (emphasis added)."
982,26," Interface Group, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 816 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1987) (""when there is no plausible connection 
between exclusive dealing and antitrust harm, courts have not hesitated to hold that dealing lawful"")."
982,27," In addition, as also noted above, even if there were evidence that the PMI contract alone indirectly caused a decrease in 
referrals to Plaintiffs' facility, that evidence would not suffice to show injury to competition rather than to a competitor. As Dr. 
Leffler recognized, where no provider has monopoly power in a market, and when patients and physicians have a choice of 
provider, there can be no harm to competition. Leffler Decl. 30."
982,28," Although Plaintiffs allege that the Blue Ridge facility is not viable without access to the Hospital, the Plaintiffs have offered no 
plausible evidence that this purported lack of viability is the result of Plaintiffs' exclusion from the Hospital. If Plaintiffs are simply 
asserting that the facility is not viable because the Hospital has effectively prevented Plaintiffs from cross-subsidizing with 
inpatient professional service revenues, this assertion is clearly not cognizable under the antitrust laws. Olympia Equip., 797 
F.2d at 376 (""if a firm went to a monopolist and said, 'Please -- for the sake of competition -- give me a loan so I can compete 
with you and make this a competitive market,' and it was turned down, it could not invoke the Sherman Act""). "
983,29," The sole case cited by Plaintiffs in which an exclusive physician contract was held to violate Section 1 is inapposite because it 
involved a clear elimination of professional anesthesia competition orchestrated by anesthesiologists. Oltz v. St. Peter's 
Community Hosp., 861 F.2d 1440 (9th ed. 1988)."
983,30," Plaintiffs are mistaken in suggesting that Defendants have the burden of demonstrating the pro-competitive effects of the 
agreement. Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition at 105. As noted above, the initial burden to prove adverse competitive effects 
is on the plaintiff, and the existence of pro-competitive justifications is relevant only after such a showing has been made. 
Areeda and Turner, Antitrust Law, 1502 at 371-72."
983,31," As briefly discussed in finding 56 supra, plaintiffs have offered a summary of their ""Evidence Regarding Causation,"" which they 
contend cites specific evidence of anti-competitive and monopolistic intent on the part of defendants. For the limited purpose of 
the pending motions, the undersigned has drawn the suggested inference from plaintiffs' proffer. While plaintiffs have cited 
Supreme Court dicta to suggest that some unspecified antitrust liability may result from evidence of intent alone, the Supreme 
Court has clearly held, when actually applying the rule of reason, that ""without a showing of actual adverse effect on competition, 
respondent cannot make out a case under the antitrust laws."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 31; see also Steuer, 672 F.2d at 
1504 (rule of reason requires showing of ""substantially adverse"" effect). As noted above, plaintiffs have made no such showing. "
987,1," The recitation of facts relies heavily (often verbatim) on the district court's somewhat more detailed factual description, to which 
Flegel and Still have offered no relevant objection. See Flegel v. Christian Hosp. Northeast-Northwest, 804 F. Supp. 1165, 1168-
71 (E.D. Mo. 1992). "
988,2," Flegel and Still also alleged several pendent state law violations over which the district court refused to exercise jurisdiction. 
Given our disposition of the federal antitrust claims, we likewise need not reach the state law claims."
988,3," Our resolution of the issues presented in this case has made it unnecessary for us to reach all of the issues presented on 
appeal. Defendants argue that they are immune from antitrust liability under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. 
The district court failed to reach this issue, and it is likewise unnecessary for us to address it. Although cognizant of a split 
between the courts of appeals on the question whether, as a matter of law, a conspiracy can be proven in a hospital privileges 
case, we decline to address that issue as well. See generally Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 
52.03[1][b][ii] (1993). Even were we to rule in the plaintiffs' favor on this issue, both as to the legal possibility and the sufficiency 
of their evidence, the defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment. We consequently leave resolution of this issue for 
an appropriate case. "
991,4," Such a showing could be made in a variety of ways, but it must consist of more than simple assertions. For example, if a group of practitioners such as D.O.'s or family practitioners is excluded, the institution must demonstrate the 
procompetitive justification, persuading the factfinder that, from the totality of circumstances, the articulated procompetitive 
rationale is consistent with the overall conduct of the hospital. For example, a facility might be able to justify personnel 
restrictions as a marketing, image-building strategy -- ""our hospital only allows board-certified practitioners to use our 
facilities."" But the institution, to prevail, would have to show active promotion of that policy in other areas (for example, 
through aggressive quality-monitoring programs) and active pursuit of an image-building campaign (for example, through 
advertising or other marketing initiatives). It would have to prove, to the satisfaction of the factfinder, that it was in fact 
pursuing its goals as a rational economic actor and that it could justify its conduct by reference to rational, procompetitive 
economic principles. James F. Blumstein & Frank A. Sloan, Antitrust and Hospital Peer Review, 51 Law & Contemp. Probs. 7, 61 (1988) (footnotes 
omitted)."
991,5," Typical of the GPDOs' assertions on this point is Dr. Martin J. Roitman's: The denial of Plaintiffs Gerhard Flegel and Richard Still to the surgical staff at [Christian] has resulted in a lower quality of 
care being available for my patients, as the urologists to whom I must make referrals for patients admitted to the hospital or 
for patients who seek hospitalization for urologic treatment at [Christian] do not generally provide me an opportunity to 
continue my participation at a preferred level in that patient's care, and Plaintiffs Flegel and Still provide a higher quality of 
urological services."
991,7," R. at 1667-68; see also 7 R. at 1672-73, 1675-76, 1678-79, 1681, 1684-85, 1690-91, 1693-94. Some of the osteopaths' 
assertions in this regard were struck by the district court after their deposition testimony revealed that they had never referred 
patients to the M.D. urologists on staff at Christian. See 1 R. at 301-04. The plaintiffs have not appealed this decision by the 
district court. Consequently, we grant their motion to strike the appendices filed by defendants because the documents they 
contain either repeat material in the record or do not bear on any issue on appeal. "
992,6," Flegel and Still argue that the presence of expert testimony by two economists suffices to survive summary judgment. That is 
only true if the experts' testimony would allow a finding of actual detrimental effects to competition. The testimony of neither of 
the proffered experts, Professor Lee K. Benham and John H. Preston, would support such a finding. Preston simply relies on the 
assertions of the GPDOs to find a reduction in quality, and Benham's testimony addresses only the possibility that the hospital 
services market in St. Louis is not competitive. A jury could not reasonably find based on these affidavits that the denial of 
privileges to Flegel and Still by Christian has caused actual detrimental effects to competition (to Flegel and Still, perhaps, but 
not to competition). "
993,7," The plaintiffs' perspective on the market has no bearing. Whether their business has suffered due to the absence of the 
potential referrals at Christian is of as little consequence as any evidence that their business is booming. See Ryko Mfg. Co. v. 
Eden Servs., 823 F.2d 1215, 1234 (8th Cir. 1987) (""the concern of antitrust law is the protection of competition, not individual 
competitors""), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1026 (1988); Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855 (9th Cir. 1977) 
(""Antitrust legislation is concerned primarily with the health of the competitive process, not with the individual competitor who 
must sink or swim in competitive enterprise."" (citations omitted)), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122, 99 S. Ct. 103 
(1978)."
993,8," Compare the plaintiffs' description of the relevant market in their memorandum to the district court in opposition to summary 
judgment: ""The relevant product market is the market for referrals of Target Patients from osteopathic physicians at [Christian]."" 
1 R. at 201. "
1003,1," The Court notes, moreover, that Rule 50(b) motions should generally be filed after the entry of judgment, not before as in this 
case. "
1005,2, AP may then file objections to Tilton's fee statement within 10 days after Tilton files and serves its statement on AP.
1005,3," AP claims that the costs that can be awarded under the antitrust statutes are limited to those enumerated in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1920 
and 1821."
1005,4, Section 1821(b) was subsequently amended to allow witness statements of up to $ 40 per day. 
1008,5," Tilton acknowledges in a footnote, however, that if the Court grants the full amount of Tilton's requested attorneys' fees under 
both the antitrust and patent statutes, the Court could then decide to award the fee only once to avoid a double recovery for 
Tilton's lawyers."
1008,6," The Court agrees with AP that most of the motion practice and discovery that occurred between October 1991 and the eve of 
the first phase of the trial involved Tilton's antitrust and state law claims, not its patent claims. To the extent this is true, Tilton 
may not recover attorneys' fees under § 285 for this work. Moreover, Tilton should only be able to recover fees under § 285 for 
those aspects of the second phase of the trial that directly involved Tilton's willful infringement and induced infringement claims. 
Tilton's billing statement must therefore present a rather detailed breakdown in the subjects on which its attorneys were working 
during any given time period. While the Court realizes that Tilton can not reconstruct the breakdown in hours with 100% 
accuracy, the Court expects a detailed showing of the breakdown in work hours expended on the patent versus the antitrust 
claims. The only overlap between the fees awarded to Tilton under the antitrust and patent laws should be in the time expended 
working on the willful infringement claim after the filing of Tilton's antitrust claims. "
1009,7," Rule 50(b) reads in part: ""Such a motion may be renewed by service and filing not later than 10 days after entry of judgment"". 
(emphasis added). "
1010,8," The Court has already ruled in connection with the antitrust claims that because this case involves a ""continuing violation,"" 
Tilton may recover damages caused by the initial termination which occurred outside the four year limitations period, but only to 
the extent such damages were incurred within the four year period preceding the filing of the claim. Order of February 12, 1993, 
at 5-6; LaSalvia v. United Dairymen of Arizona, 804 F.2d 1113, 1118-19 (9th Cir. 1986). "
1011,9," Tilton can achieve the same result, however, by Serving AP's distributors with the injunction. "
1012,10," The Court notes, for example, that while the jury apparently found that AP's exclusive distributorship agreements have caused 
Tilton anti-trust injury, there has been no showing about the effect that these agreements would have on Tilton, or the market, in 
the future Tilton has apparently set up some of its own distribution networks, so injunctive relief may not be necessary. "
1014,11," That is, any objections that Tilton's revised ""Proposed"" Order does not accurately reflect the holdings of this Order. "
1021,1," The eight Ivy League schools include Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard 
University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University. These schools were also named as 
defendants in this case, but each signed a consent decree with the United States immediately after the complaint was filed. "
1022,2, The Manual of the Council of Ivy League Presidents states:
1022,1," . Member institutions agree that the primary purpose of a college financial aid program for all students is to provide 
financial assistance to students who without such aid would be unable to attend that institution. Financial aid should only be 
awarded after it is determined that family resources are inadequate to meet the student's educational expenses, and such 
aid should not exceed the difference between educational expenses and family resources. MIT is considered a member of 
the Ivy Group for purposes of these rules."
1022,2," . Ivy Group institutions follow the common policy that any financial aid shall be awarded solely on the basis of 
demonstrated need. Moreover, in order to insure that financial awards to commonly admitted candidates are reasonably 
comparable, all Ivy Group institutions will share financial information concerning admitted candidates in an annual ""Ivy 
Overlap"" meeting just prior to the mid-April common notification date. The purpose of the overlap agreement is to neutralize 
the effect of financial aid so that a student may choose among Ivy Group institutions for non-financial reasons. a. Family contributions shall be compared and adjusted if necessary so that, as a general rule, families will be asked to pay 
approximately the same amount regardless of the Ivy Group institution they choose to attend. As a result, total financial 
need should differ by the approximate amount that costs at the respective institutions differ. Also, subject to variations in 
individual institutional financial aid policy, there is a further goal of establishing a balance between scholarship and self-help 
that is roughly comparable. b. Member institutions shall continue to compare late awards and adjustments to awards after the formal overlap session 
until the student decides which college he or she will attend."
1022,3," . So that the process of comparing financial aid awards among member institutions can be facilitated, Ivy Group financial 
aid directors shall meet as necessary to agree on the basic principles of a financial needs analysis system. In particular 
they shall agree on a common system for measuring parental ability to pay and also seek to reduce differences in the other 
elements of needs analysis such as: contributions from student assets and benefits, summer savings expectations, travel 
allowances, and adjustments for use of outside scholarships. App. at 1211-12. "
1023,3," Section one of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
1023,15, U.S.C. § 1 (1988). 
1024,4," Amici curiae include the American Council on Education, the Association of American Medical Colleges, The Association of 
American Universities, The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the College Board, the Council of Independent 
Colleges, The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the National Association of State Universities and 
Land-Grant Colleges, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the National Association of Student

1025,5," The district court commenced its analysis by noting that MIT is a significant economic entity, controlling substantial assets and 
operating a billion dollar budget. We agree with MIT that the extent of its resources is not probative of whether its financial aid is 
commerce."
1025,6," At least one Overlap member apparently agrees with this conclusion. In a paper entitled ""Tuition Income,"" Yale explains that 
""tuition, modified by student aid expenditures, is in essence the price that the University charges for its educational programs."" 
App. at 1315. "
1026,7," The district court did not make a factual finding with respect to MIT's motivation for joining the Overlap Agreement. There is 
ample evidence that MIT's indirect objective was to promote equal access to higher education and diversity within the student 
body. We cannot overlook, however, that MIT also desired to attract the most talented students at the least expense to itself, a 
result which would also flow directly from the elimination of price competition among the Ivy Overlap member institutions. In fact, 
we could conjecture a number of self-serving reasons why MIT might have entered the Overlap Agreement, not the least of 
which might have been the market power which typically accompanies combinations. The higher than competitive tuition prices 
which MIT and the other Overlap members were able to charge, absent tuition competition, enhances ""revenues"", if not ""profits"", 
which can be allocated to any conceivable internal institutional purpose. In any event, to determine whether trade or commerce is implicated, motive plays a much less important role when the nature of 
the activity, as here, is plainly commercial. An anticompetitive motive may trigger antitrust scrutiny of otherwise noncommercial 
conduct. See Marjorie Webster Junior College, Inc. v. Middle States Ass'n of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Inc., 139 U.S. 
App. D.C. 217, 432 F.2d 650, 654-55 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 965, 91 S. Ct. 367, 27 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1970). The 
opposite, however, is not also true. A beneficent objective does not excuse commercial activities from compliance with the 
Sherman Act. In Goldfarb, the Supreme Court held that a minimum fee schedule for attorneys published by a county bar 
association violated section one of the Sherman Act. 421 U.S. at 781-87, 95 S. Ct. at 2010-13. The bar association argued that 
the goal of professions, in contrast to businesses, ""is to provide services necessary to the community."" Id. at 786, 95 S. Ct. at 
2013. The Supreme Court discounted the significance of this purported motive, finding that motive arguments lose force when 
used to justify an obviously commercial endeavor. Id. "
1027,8," The contours of the traditional rule of reason inquiry have remained largely unchanged since they were first defined in Chicago

] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the 
court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts. "
1031,9," MIT's alleged pure social benefit motivation is arguably, but not necessarily, corroborated by the fact that MIT sets tuition 
considerably below its cost to begin with, and could fill its class each year with affluent students who do not need financial 
assistance. Even assuming the social benefit motivation of Overlap, however, the absence of a revenue maximizing purpose is 
neither corroborated nor obvious, notwithstanding the absence of a strictly ""profit"" maximizing purpose. Nevertheless, given the 
alleged centrality of Overlap to extending certain educational benefits to needy students, we believe that a rule of reason inquiry 
is required here to fairly assess the applicability of the Sherman Act. "
1033,10," To the extent that increasing consumer choice and promoting socioeconomic diversity in the context of higher education 
reflect social as well as procompetitive values, the district court should have considered the degree to which Overlap furthered 
these social objectives. See discussion infra, typescript at 45-51. "
1034,11," In the 1991-1992 academic year, American minorities comprised 44% of MIT's undergraduate enrollment, up from 3% to 4% 
just three decades earlier."
1034,12," The district court found that: When more than one child in a family is attending college, the Congressional Methodology evenly apportions the parental 
contribution; for example, if two children in one family are attending college, half the parental contribution would be attributed to 
each child. By contrast, the Ivy methodology apportioned the family contribution for multiple siblings based on the cost of the 
colleges the children were attending. The more a college costs, the greater part of the family contribution would be attributed to 
the student attending that college."
1034,805, F. Supp. at 293-94.
1034,13," The district court found that ""in the event a student's parents were divorced or separated, the Congressional Methodology 
expects a contribution from the custodial parent only. The Ivy Overlap Group schools considered the income of the non-custodial 
parent."" 805 F. Supp. at 294."
1034,14," The district court found that ""the Congressional Methodology subtracts from income the losses reported on parents' tax 
returns. The Ivy Overlap Group schools did not subtract these losses in calculating income to determine family contribution."" 805 
F. Supp. at 294. "
1036,15," We reject the argument raised by an amicus curiae that MIT's conduct is protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme 
Court has characterized academic freedom as ""a special concern of the First Amendment."" Regents of the Univ. of California v. 
Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 312, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2759, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) (upholding the use of race as a 
factor in admission decisions of a medical school). The freedom of a university to make its own judgments includes four 
elements: a university may ""determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be 
taught, and who may be admitted to study."" Id. (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263, 77 S. Ct. 1203, 1218, 1 
L. Ed. 2d 1311 (1957)). This constitutionally protected sphere of activity does not extend to determining how much to charge 
students for educational services. "

1039,17," The government has not demonstrated that the Overlap Group conspired to set base tuition levels, and the district court's

October 18, 1991 as the date on which New York Bottling ""abruptly closed its doors."" AR 6514. Virtually all of plaintiffs' filings in 
this case refer to the October 18 date. Whatever the precise date, however, it is undisputed that Mr. Honickman's Application 
was filed after New York Bottling ceased operations."

1071,1," The New York Power Authority has been named a defendant in this action and has filed an answer. Dismissal of the action as

1072,2," NYPA generates electric power in Niagara Falls. New York Public Authorities Law § 1005(13) authorizes NYPA to allocate a 
portion of that power to ""businesses within the state located within thirty miles of the Niagara project switchyard…"" Eligibility for 
the ""expansion power"" is based in part, through contracts negotiated by NYPA, on the businesses consuming expansion power 
to maintain certain levels of employment. See, e.g., Expansion Power Allocation and Service Agreement, Schedule B, Appendix 
A, executed by GM, NYSEG and NYPA, wherein GM agreed to a base employment level of 8000. (Attached to complaint as 
Exhibit B). § 1005(13)(a) spells out thirteen separate criteria governing eligibility for expansion power § 1005(13) also provides for the allocation by NYPA of expansion power for ""Revitalization"". § 1005(13)(b) sets forth five 
separate criteria. Basically, such cheap power is intended to keep businesses operating that would otherwise close or curtail 
operations."

1073,6," There is some dispute between the parties as to what contract this language supersedes. GM argues that it supersedes the

1086,1," Defendants' motions present several other arguments in favor of dismissing Transphase's complaint, including that 
Transphase has failed to allege any anticompetitive conduct or antitrust injury suffered by Transphase. Although these 
arguments are closely related to SDG&E's argument concerning the relevant product market, the Court does not directly address 
them. "
1087,2," Southern California Edison is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States and distributes and sells electricity to 
customers within a large segment of Los Angeles County and adjacent counties."
1087,3," SDG&E is an electric utility based in San Diego which distributes and sells electricity within a large area of Southern California, 
including San Diego County and portions of Orange County. "
1088,4," This second prong of the Midcal test prevents the State from frustrating the national policy in favor of competition by casting a 
'gauzy cloak of state involvement' over what is essentially private anticompetitive conduct."" Southern Motor Carriers, at 57 (citing 
Midcal, 445 U.S. at 106)."
1088,5," Transphase objects to the defendants' submission of and citations to these reported CPUC decision and asserts that, if the 
Court decides to consider these decisions, defendants' motions would be transformed into motions for summary judgment, 
pursuant to Rule 56. The Court disagrees. The Court may take judicial notice of these decision under Federal Rule of Evidence 
201(e) since their existence is a fact ""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned."" Fed.R.Evid. 201(e). The Ninth Circuit held in Nugget Hydroelectric v. Pacific Gas and Electric, 981 
F.2d 429, 435 (9th Cir. 1992), that a district court could take published decisions of the CPUC into account on a motion to 
dismiss in order to determine whether the state had ""actively supervised"" a defendant's allegedly anticompetitive conduct. The 
Nugget court ultimately found that the CPUC decision at issue, together with the applicable Guidelines, were sufficient to prove 
that the state actively supervised the defendant's conduct, thus satisfying the second prong of the Midcal test. The Court therefore finds that it may properly consider the reported decisions of the CPUC in the context of the defendants' 
motion to dismiss. Since the Court's consideration of these decisions does not transform this into a motion for summary 
judgment under Rule 56, the Court DENIES Transphase's request to submit evidence on the second, ""active supervision"" prong 
of the Midcal test. "
1089,6," Indeed, the CPUC recently decided, after Transphase filed this complaint, to set up direct bidding between demand and supply 
side alternatives."
1089,7, See 1988 GRC at 475-477; 1992 GRC at 144.
1089,8, See Interim DSM Bidding Pilots at 22. 
1090,9," Although SCE does not present this argument in its own motion to dismiss, the Court finds that this argument is applicable to 
SCE as well as SDG&E and thus dismisses Transphase's antitrust claims against SDG&E and SCE on the grounds presented in 
SDG&E's motion and Section C above. "
1091,10," If there were no independent basis for dismissing Transphase's complaint, the Court would allow plaintiff leave to amend its 
complaint in the event that it could, in good faith, plead that the defendants are competitors in the supply or distribution of DSM 
or TES systems. Given that the Court has also decided to dismiss Transphase's antitrust claims on two independent grounds, 
however, the Court does not grant Transphase leave to amend at this time. "
1093,*," The Honorable Floyd R. Gibson, Senior Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1096,1," L.A. Land contends that Brunswick failed to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of monopoly power in its 
motion for directed verdict, and therefore waived the right to raise this challenge on appeal. This contention is clearly spurious, 
as L.A. Land itself noted in court that Brunswick raised the question of market power in its argument on the directed verdict 
motion. R.T. at 1843."
1096,2," The jury instruction concerning monopoly power, to which Brunswick apparently did not object, did permit the jury to consider 
the departure of companies from the market as an indication of Brunswick's monopoly power. However, on review of a denial of 
a JNOV motion, this court applies the law truly controlling the case, regardless of the jury instructions.  Air-Sea Forwarders, Inc. 
v. Air Asia Co., Ltd., 880 F.2d 176, 182-83 & n. 5 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1058, 107 L. Ed. 2d 952, 110 S. Ct. 868 
(1990). "
1097,3," Average price is a composite of all the different prices charged in a bowling center and does not represent the actual price paid 
by any consumer. "
1098,4," The main sources of entry barriers are: (1) legal license; (2) control over an essential or superior resource; (3) entrenched 
buyer preferences for established brands or company reputations; and (4) capital market evaluations imposing higher capital 
costs on new entrants. Economies of scale may also be considered an entry barrier in some situations. 2 Areeda & Turner, 
Antitrust Law Par. 409b at 299-300 (1978). L.A. Land points to no evidence which fits in any of these categories."
1098,5," In its February 27, 1989 order denying Brunswick's first motion for summary judgment, the court stated the following: On the present record, plaintiffs have not met their burden of submitting sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case for all 
the elements of the alleged antitrust offenses. Nevertheless, the Court believes that plaintiffs should have more time to engage 
in discovery to support their claims. . . . The Court cautions plaintiffs, however, that the theory of their case is confused and 
problematic. Despite plaintiffs' insistence that the Brunswick market study is patently false, because the survey states that Palmdale can 
support only one new center, plaintiffs themselves argued to this Court during a prior hearing that Palmdale could only add one 
new center. Moreover, plaintiffs must offer proof that Brunswick's position as a manufacturer of bowling equipment gives 
Brunswick control of the many banks from which plaintiffs could receive financing. There is already some evidence that 
Brunswick has no such power in the financial markets. "
1099,," Because L.A. Land rejected a supply monopoly theory, it apparently never did offer proof that Brunswick, as a supplier, 
controlled all sources of financing."
1099,6," In Indiana Grocery, the court observed that ""the output of the Indianapolis retail grocery market is, of course, groceries, and 
Indiana Grocery concedes that Kroger could never control the supply of groceries in the Indianapolis retail market. If so, it is very 
difficult to see how Kroger could ever restrict total market output and thereby raise prices."" Id. (emphasis in original). The court 
further noted that ""while market share may indicate market power in certain cases, the two are not necessarily the same. Market 
share indicates market power only when sales reflect control of the productive assets in the business, for only then does it reflect 
an ability to curtail total market output."" Id. By failing to prove a supply monopoly, L.A. Land essentially failed to prove that 
Brunswick controlled access to the productive assets of the retail bowling services market."
1099,7," The jury could have inferred from the evidence presented, however, that Brunswick was a desirable supplier at the relevant 
time. "
1100,8," Contrary to an assertion by L.A. Land in this appeal, Brunswick's reliance on Kruse does not mean that its argument rests on 
the premise that it and DCC were ""identical."" Given the evidence in the record that Brunswick was not a disinterested ""third 
party"" to the relationship between L.A. Land and DCC, Kruse merely supports the proposition that L.A. Land's allegations do not 
state a tort claim as a matter of law because Brunswick was not a third party. "
1101,9," An exception is that L.A. Land does assert (presumably relying on evidence pertaining to the antitrust claim) that the 
interference here created an unlawful restraint of trade. Because we reverse the district court's judgment on the antitrust claim, 
no basis for this assertion remains. "

Middlesex, Sussex, Hudson, Essex, Bergen, and Passaic. AR 6044. "
1131,5," Mr. Honickman first acquired Seven-Up Brooklyn in 1987. See DPSU I, 798 F. Supp. at 764. After the FTC commenced its 
investigation of that acquisition, but before it filed its administrative complaint, Mr. Honickman sold most of his interests in the 
company. See id. at 765."
1131,6," The precise date on which operations ceased is unclear from the record. Mr. Honickman's Application and various 
Commission memoranda give October 24, 1991 as the date. See AR 6000, 5164, 5288. An article from New York Newsday, 
attached to Mr. Honickman's Application, indicates that New York Bottling shut its doors on October 21, 1991. See AR 6010. A 
memorandum in aid of FTC consideration of Mr. Honickman's Application, submitted by plaintiffs and dated June 24, 1992, gives 
October 18, 1991 as the date on which New York Bottling ""abruptly closed its doors."" AR 6514. Virtually all of plaintiffs' filings in 
this case refer to the October 18 date. Whatever the precise date, however, it is undisputed that Mr. Honickman's Application 
was filed after New York Bottling ceased operations."
1131,7," On December 16, 1991, the Commission partially approved and partially denied Mr. Honickman's request for interim 
distribution, permitting interim distribution in the nine New Jersey counties, but not in the three New York counties. AR 6239-
6246. Plaintiffs thereafter applied for emergency injunctive relief to compel the FTC to grant interim distribution in Manhattan, the "
1132,," Bronx, and Westchester County, which Judge Revercomb denied by Order dated December 19, 1991. See Dr Pepper/Seven-Up 
Cos. v. FTC, Civ. A. No. 91-2712- GHR, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19472 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 1991). "
1134,8," The record shows that New York Bottling's licenses to distribute Barq's and Crush brand soft drinks were terminated and 
reverted to their respective franchisors when New York Bottling closed its doors. AR 6898, 6900. "
1139,1," This product is currently marketed in various versions including an ""original scent,"" a ""country scent,"" a ""fresh scent,"" and a 
""light scent."" Sterling also markets a disinfectant in a bottle that uses just the LYSOL name and a LYSOL deodorizing cleaner 
with a lemon scent. Brand extensions include LYSOL PINE ACTION pine cleaner-disinfectant, LYSOL DIRECT multi-purpose 
spray cleaner, LYSOL basin, tub, and tile cleaner, LYSOL and LYSOL CLING toilet bowl cleaners, LYSOL PINE FRESH CLING 
toilet bowl cleaner and LYSOL PINE SCENT basin, tub and tile cleaner. "
1140,2," Sterling maintains that, in interrogatory answers filed in the 1983 action, Cyanamid ""contended that use of the trademark 
LYSOL for a pine oil cleaner, separate and apart from its trade dress, was likely to cause confusion with Cyanamid's Pine-Sol 
mark for pine oil cleaners."" (Def. 3(g) Statement). Clorox disputes this assertion calling it ""materially incomplete and misleading."" 
(Pl. 3(g) Statement). Clorox adds that it has not been ""given adequate opportunity to discover information concerning documents 
filed in the prior litigations."" (Pl. 3(g) Statement). "
1142,3," No separate analysis is required under the Donnelly Act because this Act is ""construed in light of federal precedent and given 
a different interpretation only where State policy, differences in the statutory language or the legislative history justify such a 
result."" Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Abrams, 71 N.Y.2d 327, 520 N.E.2d 535, 538, 525 N.Y.S.2d 816 (N.Y. 1988). "
1144,4," In support of this assertion, Clorox cites a recent consumer survey commissioned by Clorox which concluded that ""essentially 
no one in the applicable consuming public currently sees Pine-Sol and LYSOL as coming from a common source or origin."" (See 
Rappeport Aff. Opp. Summ. J.; Pl. Exh. B). "
1151,1," The Renfro Defendants had filed a state law counterclaim against Denny's over which the district court had supplemental 
jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. § 1367. Having dismissed all of the federal claims with prejudice, the district court declined to retain 
jurisdiction over the state law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. Plaintiff agrees that the counterclaim should be 
reinstated if the antitrust claim is remanded. Reply Brief at 37."
1151,2," The central Indiana market is defined by the parties as extending from Peru and Wabash on the north to Greenwood and 
Columbus on the south, and from Muncie and Newcastle on the east to Lafayette and Crawfordsville on the west. This 
geographic market is said to comprise the area served by Indianapolis news and advertising media. The product market 
concerns the retail sale of boats and marine accessories to consumers, and the promotion of such sales at boat and recreation 
shows. In 1989 the total sales of the relevant products in central Indiana was $ 89 million. R. 114 at 6."
1151,3," The original defendants included International Shows, Inc. and its president Charles Worpell. They also produce an annual 
boat show in Indianapolis, but Denny's settled its claims against them prior to filing its Amended Complaint below. "
1152,4," The district court assumed, for the purposes of ruling on the defendants' motions for summary judgment, that ""(1) the Dealer 
Defendants and CIMDA conspired to get Denny's out of the Boat Shows because it was a pricecutter; (2) the Renfro Defendants 
and/or International [International Shows, Inc., another producer of boat shows] joined the conspiracy, giving it the power to 
achieve its goals, and Denny's was kicked out; (3) with Denny's gone, the defendants were able to (and did) charge higher 
prices at the Boat Shows than they could have otherwise. . . ."" App. at 24."
1152,5," The Renfro Defendants argue that their conduct was not part of a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy but rather was unilateral 
action taken to ensure that their shows would not be damaged by the plaintiff free-riding on other exhibitors' elaborate displays. 
The argument is misplaced because there is presently enough evidence of a conspiracy to withstand defendants' motions for 
summary judgment. At trial, of course, all the defendants are free to argue that they did not conspire against the plaintiff. "
1153,6," The requirement imposed by the district court is not the same as the ""quick look"" described in General Leaseways v. National 
Trucking Ass'n, 744 F.2d 588, 595 (7th Cir. 1984). When an otherwise-illegal practice is alleged to be in furtherance of a lawful, 
pro-competitive end, a ""quick look"" at the economies of the restraint might be necessary in order to decide whether to apply the 
per se rule. In this case, however, the Dealer Defendants have not alleged a lawful end to which the restraint in question could 
be said to be ancillary."
1153,7," Plaintiff actually offers this as an explanation of why it elected to pursue only a legal theory that would trigger the per se rule 
and not one that would trigger the so-called rule of reason. The rule of reason requires an inquiry into whether the challenged 
practices were ""unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions."" Standard Oil Co., 221 U.S. 1, 65, 55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 
502; accord National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 690, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355. 
Proof of actual impact on competitive conditions can result in both parties presenting extensive economic analysis of the relevant 
market. It is in part to avoid such excessive costs of litigation that the per se rule is applied in cases where the anti-competitive 
effect of certain practices may be presumed. The court below incorrectly required plaintiff to establish a ""potential"" for impact on competitive conditions before it would apply 
the per se rule. This would effectively require plaintiffs to make a rule of reason demonstration in order to invoke the per se rule! "
1173,1," Electronic pet restraints emit low frequency signals which are inaudible to the human ear and which harm a pet that strays 
from the area ""fenced in"" by these signals."
1173,2," Two defendants were dismissed pursuant to Rule 4(j), F.R.Civ.P., and two others were dismissed for lack of prosecution. "
1174,3, It appears that it was the violation by plaintiffs of this exclusivity agreement that led to their termination as an IF distributor.
1174,4," It is not clear from the complaint what is meant by ""junking."""
1174,5," The complaint also claims, in its introductory paragraph, violations by defendants of the ""Fair Trade Law."" However, the 
complaint does not address such a law beyond this initial mention of it, and the Court will not therefore consider that assertion. "
1176,6," Defendant Canine Fence, Inc., acknowledges in its motion to dismiss that it has twice sold goods to a Maryland resident. It 
sold replacement parts for a machine that it had sold in Connecticut, whose buyer later moved to Maryland. Two isolated sales 
to one customer in Maryland does not constitute the necessary minimum contacts under the International Shoe due process 
analysis. Moreover, plaintiffs did not even file an opposition to Canine Fence's motion to dismiss."
1176,7," In a case such as this one, HN4[
] the burden is on the plaintiff to make out a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over a 
defendant. Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. AKZO, N.V., 2 F.3d 56, 60 (4th Cir. 1993)."
1176,8," In their opposition to defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, plaintiffs completely ignore the issue of 
personal jurisdiction. Instead, they argue that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction in antitrust cases and that venue was 
proper in this district. It is axiomatic, however, that ""venue provisions come into play only after jurisdiction has been established."" 
Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, 470 U.S. 768, 793 n.30, 84 L. Ed. 2d 674, 105 S. Ct. 1620 (1985). See also, Neirbo 
Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S. 165, 167-68, 84 L. Ed. 167, 60 S. Ct. 153 (1939), 15 C. Wright & A. Miller, 
Federal Practice and Procedure § 3801, at 4-5 (1986). "
1177,9," while this Court discusses herein only the motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim of these two defendants, its analysis 
would apply to the other defendants as well. Plaintiffs' failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted thus represents 
an alternative ground for dismissal of the other thirteen defendants as well."
1177,10," If an amended complaint is filed, it should be drafted in strict compliance with Rule 8(a) and Rule 10(b), F.R.Civ.P. "
1178,11," In addition, plaintiffs allege various types of unilateral conduct on the part of defendant IF, such as buying plaintiffs' stock and 
""junking"" it, and placing some retailers on a ""consignment basis."" Complaint P 19. Unilateral conduct, however, does not violate 
§ 1 of the Sherman Act, which bars a ""conspiracy"" in restraint of trade. More than one party is obviously required. Monsanto v. 
Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). "
1179,12, Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not relate in any way to defendants' distributorship system or to contracts between them.
1179,13," Nor does the complaint address the second element. In this Circuit, a plaintiff must show, in order to satisfy this element, that 
there could be no valid business reason or concern for efficiency for the defendant's conduct. Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 710. "
1180,14," Paragraph 19, entitled ""Violations of Title 15 USC § 1 and § 2,"" states:"
1180,19," . At various times between January 1992 and January 1993 Defendant, Invisible Fence Company, Inc. took over the 
stock of Gabriel and Associates, Inc. and the Laura [sic] and Bev Corporation sold by the Plaintiffs to retail sellers in the 
state of Maryland and the state of North Carolina and arranged to junk and destroy such stocks. At the same time 
Defendant, Invisible Fence Company, Inc. arranged to place such retail sellers who were the Plaintiff's customers under a 
consignment basis to induce them to transfer their business from the Plaintiffs to the Defendant, Invisible Fence Company, 
Inc., thereby committing indirect price discrimination in violation of Title 15 USC § 13, Subsection (a). "
1186,1," Perez Companc, sold its 50% of the Argentine entities, to a third party for $ 55 million without informing Lone Star. Lone Star 
later sold its 50% interest to the same party for $ 37 million; Perez Companc did not bid and there were no other bidders. For a 
more detailed discussion of the facts, see In re New York Trap Rock Corp. (Lone Star Industries v Compania Naviera Perez 
Companc et al.), 155 Bankr. 871 (1993) (Schwartzberg, J.). "
1187,2," Appellant points out that a transaction not involving a debtor may violate 11 USC 363(n) if it is a ruse or subterfuge to prevent 
someone from bidding, but this concept is inapplicable to the present case. Appellant also stresses that it never waived the right 
to discovery. But no specific discoverable information which would alter Judge Schwartzberg's ruling or those in this 
memorandum order has, however, been pinpointed. I find these and numerous other objections made to Judge Schwartzberg's 
decision lacking in merit. "
1196,1," The original plaintiff in this action, Boyle-Midway Household Products, Inc., transferred all of its rights, title, and interest to the 
trademark at issue in this case to AHP."
1196,2," The complaint also stated a claim for dilution of trademark under Illinois law. The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment 
on the dilution claim. See AHP, 1 F.3d at 619."
1196,3," Circuit Rule 36 provides that on remand after a trial, a case generally must be reassigned to a different judge. The Seventh 
Circuit found that the district court had ""evaluate[d] the evidence as if the proceeding were a trial on the merits,"" and concluded 
that the case therefore must be reassigned. AHP, 1 F.3d at 620. "
1198,4," For the same reasons, AHP's contention that Stuart Male's counterclaim ""does not serve the purposes of the Declaratory 
Judgment Act"" because it ""adds nothing to the issues raised in the existing pleadings"" also lacks merit. "
1206,1," Vernon Cannon died after this litigation began. His wife Metha Jean Cannon replaced him as a defendant in her capacity as 
executrix of his estate. For ease of discussion, the court will continue to refer to Mr. Cannon as the defendant. "
1207,2," Coleman v. Cannon Oil Co., 141 F.R.D. 516, 519 (M.D. Ala. 1992). The court, however, denied plaintiffs' request to certify a 
plaintiff class with regard to ""injunctive relief."" Id. Also, the City of Dothan is within Houston County, Alabama."
1207,3," Order of March 4, 1993."
1207,4," Order of January 30, 1992."
1207,5," Order of June 17, 1992."
1207,6," Order of April 20, 1993."
1207,7," After the trial, plaintiffs asked the court to reconsider its order granting summary judgment in favor of Southeastern Oil 
Company, Herndon Oil Company, McGee Oil Company, and Davis & Harp Oil Company. Plaintiffs also asked the court to add 
new individual defendants. Plaintiffs contended that the trial evidence reflected that these persons and companies were part of 
the trial defendants' conspiracy to fix prices. By order dated February 24, 1993, the court denied the plaintiffs' request as 
untimely. See DeBruyne v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 920 F.2d 457, 471 (7th Cir. 1990) (on a 
motion to reconsider, a court ordinarily will not hear evidence that was within the moving party's knowledge at the time of the 
initial decision); Barton v. American Red Cross, 826 F. Supp. 407, 409 (M.D. Ala. 1993) (Thompson, J.) (same). "
1208,8," Plaintiffs also seek prospective injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 26 (West Supp. 1993); this 
requested relief is discussed later in this memorandum opinion. "
1212,9," Early in this litigation, plaintiffs argued that unless a defendant's explanation for parallel conduct is ""procompetitive,"" the court 
must find for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs premised this argument on a statement by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1574 (11th Cir. 1991), that, where a defendant can put forth a ""plausible, 
procompetitive explanation for his actions,"" a court should be reluctant to find them circumstantial evidence that an antitrust 
violation has occurred. The plaintiffs have, however, twisted the quote from Seagood. The Appellate Court merely stated that, if 
the defendants' reason is procompetitive, and thus plausible, a court should not find a conspiracy. The court did not say, or 
intend, that procompetitiveness is a prerequisite for a finding that a conspiracy did not exist. Indeed, as shown above, an 
anticompetitive motive could very well result from nothing more than an effort to survive because of interdependence among the 
firm and its' rival. "
1213,10," Although it could perhaps be argued that the anecdotal evidence alone would not support a conclusion of price fixing on the 
part of all these defendants--the evidence is admittedly stronger as to some defendants and weaker as to others--the anecdotal 
evidence when considered with all other evidence substantially supports the conclusion that all these defendants engaged in 
price fixing. "
1214,11," There was evidence that Parrish and an employee of Sunshine-Jr. Stores, Jim Burkhalter, were friends and had met on one 
or more occasions in Panama City, Florida. However, both men denied discussing gas prices, and the mere fact that they met is 
insufficient to support a finding that they fixed prices, even in the face of evidence of independent and interdependent of parallel 
pricing. There was also evidence that Burkhalter was friends with and had met other defendants. However, as stated, the mere 
fact that defendants met together or telephoned each other, while probative, would not support a finding by itself that they had 
engaged in an effort to fix prices. Areeda, P 1417b at 97 (1986). Plaintiffs also suggest that Burkhalter gave false testimony before and during the trial. Burkhalter's false testimony would merely 
serve to impeach him and to discredit his denial of involvement in the other defendants' conspiracy; it cannot, however, be the 
basis for an affirmative finding of his involvement without any affirmative evidence to that effect. In other words, if there were 
other credible and substantial evidence of Burkhalter's (and, by implication, Sunshine-Jr. Stores') involvement in the price-fixing 
conspiracy, then Burkhalter's denial of involvement could be discredited by his false testimony, and a jury could reasonably find 
that he was a part of the conspiracy; but in such case the finding of his involvement would be based on the other credible and 
substantial evidence."
1214,12," The evidence suggests that, after this lawsuit was filed, defendants abandoned their parallel pricing. This evidence, by itself, 
would merely reflect that, perhaps out of fear of this litigation, defendants abandoned, not any agreement to fix prices, but rather 
their interdependent conscious parallel pricing. Nevertheless, this evidence, in conjunction with the evidence of the pre-litigation 
parallel pricing and the anectodal evidence, supports the conclusion that all defendants, except Sunshine-Jr. Stores, fixed 
prices. "
1215,13," Defendants appear to suggest that nominal damages are neither appropriate under nor authorized by the Sherman and 
Clayton Acts. However, because none of the parties objected to the court's instructions on nominal damages or otherwise 
contended that the instructions were an incorrect statement of law, it is now too late for them to complain that nominal damages-
-at least, as specifically defined in the court's instructions--are not a type of relief which a jury may award under the antitrust 
laws."
1215,14," Section 16 provides in part: HN17[
] ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of 
the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, 
including sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief 
against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such 
proceedings. . . . In any action under this section in which the plaintiff substantially prevails, the court shall award the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to such plaintiff."" "
1217,15," In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 756 F.2d 411 (5th Cir. 1985), and United States Football League v. National 
Football League, 842 F.2d 1335 (2d Cir. 1988), relied upon by defendants, do not warrant denying injunctive relief in this case. 
First of all, in Corrugated Container, the jury did not find, as did the jury in the instant case, that plaintiffs had suffered actual 
antitrust damages. In National Football League, plaintiffs did not appeal from the trial judge's finding that the illegal antitrust 
activity was not likely to continue or reoccur, and the appellate court otherwise found that injunctive relief was not appropriate 
under the antitrust laws. But second and more importantly, whether injunctive relief is appropriate should be determined on a 
case-by-case basis. The specific factual circumstances presented to this court, for the reasons given, warrant such relief against 
defendants Cannon Oil Company, Thomas Shirley, Home Oil Company, James Sheffield, Sheffield Oil Company, and Rodney 
Parrish."
1217,16," Because Vernon Cannon is now deceased, he will not be included in the injunction. "
1227,1, The annual marine products selling season begins each September with a trade show.
1227,2," U.S. Anchor's trial exhibits will be cited as ""USTX _,"" Rule's trial exhibits as ""RTX _"" and Tie Down's trial exhibits as ""TDTX _."" "
1228,3," (USTX 372 (Rule's 1989-90 price list; 50.4 to 96.27 spread); USTX 368 (Rule's 1988-89 price list; 49.7 to 96.27 spread); USTX 
362 (Rule's 1987-88 price list; 73.4 to 91.77 spread); USTX 355 (Rule's 1986-87 price list; 61.0 to 76.17 spread); see also USTX 
371 (U.S. Anchor's 1989-90 price list); USTX 367 (U.S. Anchor's 1988-89 price list); USTX 365 (U.S. Anchor's 1987-88 price 
list).) U.S. Anchor repeatedly opened the marine season with prices higher than Rule's, only to reduce its prices when Rule 
failed to follow U.S. Anchor's pricing strategy."
1228,4," The parties have treated this appeal as though premium fluke anchors were irrelevant. They have also ignored other types of 
anchors designed for holding on different bottom conditions (fluke anchors are most useful on sandy bottoms and least effective 
in gripping grassy bottoms). We do the same."
1228,5," Although neither party adduced direct evidence of the combined Rule/Tie Down unit market share in 1984-85 with Danforths 
included, the jury must have concluded that the firms' combined unit share for that season with the higher-priced anchors 
included was somewhat greater than the 61.57 unit share they garnered in the non-Danforth market because only Rule 
marketed the Danforth line. U.S. Anchor's USTX 467 indicates that Rule itself had no 1984-85 revenues in the non-Danforth 
market. But Rule's RTX 674, which appears to represent the non-Danforth unit market (compare RTX 674, col. 1985-86 with 
RTX 675 at 1, rows 1985-86), shows Rule with 12.67 of that market in 1984-85. We assume that RTX 674 attributes to Rule the 
non-Danforth production of Tie Down following the Rule-Tie Down transaction in the final quarter of the 1984-85 season. "
1229,6," Section 2 provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony…."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
1229,7," Section 1 provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination …, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1229,8," Section 3 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce … to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods …, 
whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption, or resale within the United States … on the condition, agreement, or 
understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods … of a competitor or competitors of

lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
1229,15," U.S.C. § 14. Among other possible differences between the Sherman Act and Robinson-Patman Act tying provisions is 
that the Sherman Act prohibition extends to arrangements affecting the sale of services and realty as well as goods. See, 
e.g., Tic-X-Press, Inc. v. Omni Promotions Co., 815 F.2d 1407 (11th Cir.1987) (tying arrangement conditioning the lease of 
coliseum theater space upon the employment of a ticket-selling agency affiliated with the lessor); see generally Thompson

1229,9," A motion for directed verdict is now deemed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, and motions for judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict are now renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. "
1230,10," A predatory pricing scheme could be successful by driving the victim out of business or by coercing him to reduce output to 
levels consistent with profit-maximization by a firm or syndicate possessing monopoly power. Either result would eliminate the

American Key raised the question of market definition but failed to raise, inter alia, the existence of monopoly power. Although 
the omission technically ""abandoned"" the issue of market power, the court addressed it anyway.  762 F.2d at 1579-81. We 
believe Rule's brief puts this case closer to American Key than cases in which a brief merely stated an issue without fact and 
argument, or actually ignored an entire claim or defense. Cf.  Joe Regueira, Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 642 F.2d 826, 833 n.

1234,19," U.S. Anchor's unit sales exhibit, USTX 479, shows an even more marked decrease in Danforth sales for the two seasons: a 
7.87 drop from 56,431 in 1985-86 to 52,035 in 1986-87. This is only one example of inconsistency in the evidence offered by 
U.S. Anchor, but we assume that the jury credited the version least favorable to Rule."
1234,20," Faced with this evidence, we can only note that the absence of proof concerning changes in prices and sales before the Rule-
Tie Down transaction is an especially prominent flaw in U.S. Anchor's case."
1234,21," By ""significant in magnitude"" we refer to a shift that is large enough to render unprofitable a monopolistic price increase in the 
broader market. Again, we defer the task of establishing criteria for testing the quantitative significance of changes in this 
variable."
1234,22," There is no evidence that Rule was irrational in its pricing strategies, although it may well have been misinformed or overly 
optimistic concerning U.S. Anchor's staying power in the market. "
1235,23," Of course, Rule's exclusive control over the Danforth trademark also eliminated the possibility of supply substitution by other 
firms making Danforths. This observation by itself, however, would not be sufficient to show that Danforths and generics 
represented distinct markets."

1236,26," Notably, in McGahee itself the district court had observed that despite the defendant's concession for summary judgment 
purposes concerning the relevant product market, ""there is, at the very least, an issue of fact as to whether propane constitutes 
a distinct product market."" 658 F. Supp. at 192 n. 3 (citing United States v. Empire Gas Corp., 537 F.2d 296, 303-304 (8th

1238,27," If we accepted Rule's argument we could simply remand for a new trial with directions to instruct the jury concerning this 
""element"" of the plaintiff's case, or we could evaluate the record to see whether the jury could have found the element proven. "
1239,28," We have considered U.S. Anchor's contention that the district court abused its discretion by excluding certain evidence that 
Rule's customers perceived an attempt by Rule to eliminate U.S. Anchor from the market, a perception based upon reported 
statements made by a Rule employee. (See USTX 206.) This evidence has such little bearing on the existence of an agreement 
between Rule and Tie Down that its exclusion on hearsay grounds, even if erroneous, see United States v. Pendas-Martinez, 
845 F.2d 938, 942-43 (11th Cir.1988); Southern Stone Co. v. Singer, 665 F.2d 698, 703 (5th Cir. Unit B Jan. 1982), was

1241,30," The mechanics of Georgia's statute of limitations have been explained as follows: The test to be applied in determining when the statute of limitations begins to run against an action sounding in tort is in 
whether the act causing the damage is in and of itself an invasion of some right of the plaintiff, and thus constitutes a legal 
injury and gives rise to a cause of action. If the act is of itself not unlawful in this sense, and a recovery is sought only on 
account of damage subsequently accruing from and consequent upon the act, the cause of action accrues and the statute 
begins to run only when the damage is sustained; but if the act causing such subsequent damage is of itself unlawful in the 
sense that it constitutes a legal injury to the plaintiff, and is thus a completed wrong, the cause of action accrues and the 
statute begins to run from the time the act is committed, however slight the actual damage then may be. Fox v. Ravinia Club, Inc., 202 Ga. App. 260, 414 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1991) (quotation omitted), cert. denied, No. Fox v. 
Ravinia Club, 1992 Ga. LEXIS 91 (Ga. Feb. 4, 1992). As we understand the test, U.S. Anchor's cause of action (if any) "
1242,," continued to accrue with each predatory sale, and would be time-barred under O.C.G.A. § 9-3-31 with respect to each 
transaction occurring more than four years before commencement of the new action in state court. See Cleveland Lumber 
Co. v. Proctor & Schwartz, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1088, 1094 (N.D.Ga.1975) (citing Georgia Power Co. v. Moore, 47 Ga. App.

1242,31," We need not decide whether § 1367 would allow the court of appeals to decide the propriety of exercising supplemental 
jurisdiction or whether such discretion is vested in the district court alone. "
