21,1," There is a fourth manufacturer of burglar alarm products, Honeywell. Honeywell sells only through its own wholly-owned 
wholesale distributor, ADI. ADI is the only electronic security distributor which is national in scope. ADI does not sell Tyco, 
Napco or Sentrol GE burglar alarm products. "
22,2," The issue of the ""relevant product market"" bears upon all three of AlarMax's antitrust claims. For instance, a rule of reason 
analysis under AlarMax's § 1 claim for restraint of trade requires that I consider the alleged restraint's competitive effect in a well 
defined relevant market. See ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (Fifth) Vol. I, p. 525-527. Similarly, 
with respect to AlarMax's claim under § 2 that Tyco attempted to gain a monopoly, ""identification of the relevant market is "
23,," essential to proving … attempted monopolization."" Id., p. 528 (citations  [*6] omitted). Finally, AlarMax's § 3 claim of exclusive 
dealing must be assessed in light of whether Tyco's actions substantially lessened competition or created a monopoly within the 
relevant market. Id."
23,3," The geographic market is ""the 'area of effective competition … in which the seller operates, and to which the purchaser can 
practicably turn for supplies.'"" United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 359, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915

24,5," Tyco opines that AlarMax would benefit from not signing the new Distribution Agreement because it would lack competition to 
sell the Napco and Sentrol GE product. This argument ignores AlarMax's allegations that it has already sustained the harm 
detailed above. "
26,1," Fairbank contends that his removal petition complies with the thirty-day requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b), because he was 
never served with the Complaint. He did not learn of the matter until a Notice of Trial was mailed to Capital One on February 26, 
2008. "
27,2," ""[T]he paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule . . . [are] that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint, 
that a federal question must appear on the face of the complaint, and that the plaintiff may, by eschewing claims based on 
federal law, choose to have the cause heard in state court."" Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 398-399, 107 S. Ct. 2425, 
96 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1987). "
29,*," Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation. "
32,1," Thus joining a few leasing companies, even if those lessors were alleged to be part of the conspiracy, does not solve the 
problem."
32,2," Plaintiffs claim that the district court accepted by implication their motion to amend their complaint, made without any further 
elaboration in a footnote in their response to defendants' motion to dismiss. This argument is without merit."
32,3," Plaintiffs appear to confuse what they plead in their complaints with what they argue in their briefs before this court and the 
court below. As already noted, it is the fact-pleading in the complaints that controls. "
33,4," Similarly, Mercedes-Benz does not suggest that there is anything inherent about leasing arrangements that makes lessees' 
alleged injuries distinct from the injuries of the dealers. For example, plaintiffs are adamant that the dealers could not recover 
duplicative damages because the dealers do not pay the overcharges in the monthly lease payments, or because the dealers 
never paid for the ""use"" of the cars. That, however, is equivalent to arguing that a dealer who does not pay a purchaser's 
monthly car payments has no claim for antitrust damages against the manufacturer that overcharged the dealer for the car in the 
first place. These are both indirect purchaser situations."
33,5," Plaintiffs did note before the district court that the statute of limitations might have run on the dealers, but they did not argue 
that its expiration had any legal significance, as they attempt to do here. "
35,1, All other claims in this case against all other parties have been dismissed or otherwise  [*4] resolved.
35,2," AT&T's request for oral argument is denied because the court does not believe that oral argument would be of material 
assistance in resolving the motion. See D. Kan. Rule 7.2 (requests for oral argument are granted only at the court's discretion). "
36,3, Plaintiffs have settled their claims against Sprint.
36,4," MCI filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and was later purchased by Verizon Communications, Inc."
36,5," By 1998, there were at least six hundred telecommunications carriers that provided long distance service. By 2004, the number 
of long distance  [*7] carriers had grown to over one thousand. "
39,6," Plaintiffs' attempt to dispute this statement of fact is without merit. The first statement they quote does not relate to the way 
ABS calculated overheads and, additionally, it is from a December 2000 email that discusses over-recovery in 1999 and 2000, 
all of which predates the class period. The second statement they quote is from an internal AT&T document that was authored 
by Mr. Trevithick, who testified that the statement he made in the document related to the FCC's audits of Qwest, Sprint, and 
MCI, and that  [*18] it did not concern AT&T. Thus, plaintiffs have not established that the FCC had a problem with the way 
AT&T or ABS, in particular, calculated overheads during the class period. "
47,7," AT&T points out that this document relates to 900 Services only, which are not at issue in this case. "
48,8," Plaintiffs also rely on what they contend is evidence that establishes that component price-fixing can result in an antitrust 
violation. The type of evidence advanced by plaintiffs on this point is not really appropriate for a summary judgment record and 
therefore the court does not consider it here. Nonetheless, the court wishes to note that plaintiffs' argument on this point does 
not impact the court's resolution of AT&T's motion because  [*41] plaintiffs raised this argument in response to AT&T's argument 
that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that each class member was injured by the alleged agreement. As explained below, the 
court finds that AT&T is not entitled to summary judgment on this issue in any event. "
54,9, AT&T points out that this same email indicates an under-recovery of $ 24 million for the second half of 1998.
54,10," AT&T points out that Mr. Trevithick, the author  [*52] of the PowerPoint document, testified that the quoted passage reflected 
his understanding of FCC audits of Qwest, Sprint, and MCI, and did not concern AT&T. "
56,11," AT&T notes that this language refers to a conversation regarding proposed regulatory changes at the FCC level, which AT&T 
claims is a constitutionally protected activity. "
57,12," Again, AT&T points out that this document refers to lobbying efforts at the FCC to try to reform the USF assessment 
mechanism. "
58,13," In AT&T's reply brief it has set forth pages of arguments seeking to undermine the opinions of Professors Williams  [*67] and 
Wilkie largely based on their own deposition testimony as well as AT&T's experts' criticism of their opinions. Because AT&T 
waited until its reply brief to raise these issues, however, plaintiff has not had an opportunity to respond to these arguments that 
AT&T raised for the first time in its reply brief. Thus, for summary judgment purposes, AT&T has waived these arguments. See 
Green v. New Mexico, 420 F.3d 1189, 1196-97 (10th Cir. 2005) (""Generally, the nonmoving party should be given an opportunity 
to respond to new material raised for the first time in the movant's reply.""); Minshall v. McGraw Hill Broadcasting Co., 323 F.3d 
1273, 1288 (10th Cir. 2003) (argument raised for the first time in reply brief is waived). The appropriate course of action if AT&T 
believed that the court should not consider their opinions for summary judgment purposes would have been to file a motion to 
exclude their opinions. That way, plaintiffs would have had an opportunity to respond to AT&T's arguments. AT&T may have 
valid arguments as to why plaintiffs' experts' opinions are not persuasive, but at this procedural juncture the appropriate forum 
for AT&T to launch that attack is cross-examination  [*68] at trial. Consistent with the well established standard for evaluating the 
summary judgment record, the court must view their opinions in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. "
65,14," AT&T also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on  [*97] plaintiffs' claims of over-recovery of damages, and it urges 
the court to distinguish between over-recoveries that were unintentional (due to forecasting errors) and those that were 
deliberate attempts by carriers to collect more than it paid in USF taxes. This argument clearly is not a valid ground for granting 
summary judgment and, in fact, AT&T does not even cite any legal authority in support of this theory. "
67,15," The court does not exclude the possibility that this issue could be resolved on a Rule 50 motion at trial, of course. "
76,1," The following ""facts"" are taken from Superior's Complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of these motions to dismiss. "
78,2," Puronics argued that the ""part performance"" exception to the Statute of Frauds applies only to real estate actions, but Superior 
did not respond to that argument."
78,3," As stated above, this claim is dismissed as against Ionics. "
85,1," The retailers' complaint will be referenced with ""BA,"" for Baby Age, the first named retailer. The consumers' complaint will be 
referenced with ""McD,"" for McDonough, the first named consumer. "
87,2," McD P 173 replaces the ""50.1%"" figure  [*17] with the phrase ""a significant portion."""
87,3," Also, my opinion noted that these plus factors represent a non-exhaustive list of indicia of concerted action."
87,4," Kids Line cites Kendall v. Visa, 518 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2008) for the (unremarkable) proposition that HN5[
] allegations of 
parallel conduct -- without more -- cannot survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a Sherman § 1 claim. KL Mot., at 6. 
However, Plaintiffs here have alleged more. Namely, they have alleged the presence of three plus factors recognized by the 
Third Circuit as tending to negate the possibility of independent action. It is also worth noting that the Sherman § 1 conspiracy 
allegations in Kendall were, by and large, direct allegations of conspiracy, rather than indirect allegations of conspiracy made via 
parallel conduct and plus  [*19] factors. In contrast, in my May 20, 2008 opinion, I relied primarily on indirect allegations. "
103,1," We use the term ""Commission"" to refer to the Commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission that decided this case at the 
final administrative level. Its opinion at issue on this appeal is Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., et al., 138 F.T.C. 1024, 2005 WL 
120878 (FTC) (2005) (""Op.'). We use the term the ""Government"" to refer to complainant counsel executing the Federal Trade 
Commission's separate investigatory and enforcement functions. In other words, the ""Government"" brings a complaint before the 
""Commission"" for adjudication. See 16 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.11; see also Genuine Parts Co. v. FTC, 445 F.2d 1382, 1388 (5th Cir. 
1971). "
104,2," On August 29, 2000, CB&I and PDM entered into a letter of intent for CB&I to acquire the assets from PDM. On September 12, 
2000, CB&I notified the U.S. Department of Justice of the proposed acquisition per 15 U.S.C. § 18a, which requires notification 
for certain large acquisitions of securities and assets. HN1[
] Under 15 U.S.C. § 18a(b), the parties were required to wait thirty days before concluding the transaction. More than thirty days later, but before executing the acquisition, the Commission notified 
CB&I that it had begun its investigation. See 15 U.S.C. § 46; 16 C.F.R. § 2.1. CB&I initially agreed  [**5] to delay executing the 
merger to accommodate the Government's investigation. Approximately four months after the expiration of the 30-day statutory 
waiting period, on February 7, 2001, CB&I concluded the deal and acquired PDM's pertinent assets for approximately $ 84 
million. "
105,3," The discussion here refers primarily to the LNG tanks, because both appellants and appellee focus on the LNG market and 
extrapolate the general conclusions about the LNG market to all markets."
105,4," On February 1, 2005, CB&I filed with the Commission a petition to reconsider in light of further evidence of actual new entry of 
foreign competitors into the relevant markets. On March 11, 2005, CB&I filed a petition for review of the December 21st Order 
and Opinion with this court. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(c). On May 10, 2005, the Commission denied the petition regarding actual new 
entry because CB&I had failed to show that any new entry could counteract competition lost from CB&I's acquisition of PDM. 
See Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., et. al., 139 F.T.C. 553, 2005 WL 2329811 (2005) (""R.O.""). On December 15, 2005, CB&I filed a 
motion to adduce additional evidence, substantially similar to new evidence submitted in the petition to reconsider below, with 
this court. We denied this motion  [**10] on April 13, 2005. "
106,5," The appeal at issue primarily concerns section 7 of the Clayton Act as HN5[
] section 5 of the FTC Act is, as the Commission determined and the parties do not contest, a derivative violation that does not require independent analysis. See Op., at 5 n.23. "
107,6," CB&I misinterprets the last sentence to argue that the Eleventh Circuit's flexible reading of the burden-shifting framework 
applies only when time is of the essence. Without any basis in the text, CB&I narrows the Eleventh Circuit's opinion. Reading the 
passage as a whole, the Eleventh Circuit considers the Baker Hughes framework as generally flexible in practice for all 
situations, but only emphasizes the need for flexibility when time is of the essence. See Univ. Health, 938 F.2d at 1219 n.25 
(""This is particularly true when the government seeks a temporary restraining order or, as here, a preliminary injunction and, 
thus, time is of the essence."") (emphasis added). "
108,7," The mere fact that the Commission used the word ""persuasive"" does not prevent this court from independently examining the 
context  [**22] of its conclusions and affirming the judgment if it was indeed correct under the proper legal standards. Cf. Rebel 
Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1435-36 (9th Cir. 1995) (HN12[
] engaging an independent review of the 
evidence despite respondent's claim that the trial court's ""persuasive"" language possibly implied an improper weighing of the 
evidence). In any event, CB&I misconstrues the Commission's use of the word ""persuasive,"" and its use does not suggest any 
improper burden-shifting. The Commission did not use ""persuasive"" to compare CB&I's evidence to the prima facie evidence. 
Instead, in the instances cited by CB&I, (1) the Commission describes CB&I's arguments that certain conclusions should be 
inferred from its evidence as ""unpersuasive"" and does not address the evidence itself, see, e.g., Op. at 61, Op. at 71, Op. at 91, 
R.O. at 9; and (2) the Commission describes a customer's statement as internally ""unpersuasive,"" because it contradicts the 
customer's other proffered evidence; again, this does not describe any comparison between CB&I's evidence and the prima 
facie case. See Op. at 65.14 "
110,8," HN16[
] Entry barriers are ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by incumbent firms but must be incurred by new 
entrants,"" or ""factors in the market that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn monopoly returns."" Los Angeles 
Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1427-28 (9th Cir. 1993)  [**28] (internal quotations omitted); see also Colorado 
Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. Of Am., 885 F.2d 683, 696 n.21 (10th Cir. 1989) (""Barriers to entry are market 
characteristics which make it difficult or time-consuming for new firms to enter a market."")."
110,9," CB&I also misconstrues the I.D. and  [**29] the Commission opinion to argue that the Commission ignored the ALJ's finding of 
no supracompetitive price increases post-acquisition. In fact, the ALJ only concluded that the Government did not prove nor was 
required to prove supracompetitive prices existed post-acquisition. I.D., at 114. Neither the ALJ nor the Commission directly 
ruled that there were no supracompetitive price increases post-acquisition. See Op., at 91; I.D., at 114. In the pertinent part of 
the opinion, the Commission rejected the Government's proffered evidence of post-acquisition price increases because while 
such evidence tends to show the acquisition would lead to anti-competitive conditions, existing evidence was already sufficient 
to lead to that conclusion. HN18[
] ""Whether post-acquisition evidence is admissible depends on the nature of the evidence."" Dailey v. Quality School Plan, Inc., 427 F.2d 1080, 1082 (5th Cir. 1970) (citing FTC v. Procter & Gamble, 386 U.S. 568, 87 S. Ct. 
1224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967)); see id. at 576 (rejecting Court of Appeal's reliance on four years of post-merger data as 
""misapprehend[ing] the standards for its review and the standards applicable in a [Section 7 of the Clayton Act] proceeding.""). 
We read Dailey as providing  [**30] the trial court discretion in deciding when to admit post-acquisition evidence and Procter & 
Gamble as concluding that post-acquisition evidence is not dispositive. The Commission thus did not abuse its discretion in so 
ruling. See In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, 655 F.2d 627, 637 (5th Cir. 1981). "
111,10," CB&I relies on Baker Hughes to argue that the very threat of entry from foreign firms would constrain anti-competitive effects a 
fortiori such that it is not necessary that a new entrant enter ""on par."" See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 988. Such reliance is 
misplaced. First, HN20[
] Baker Hughes' conclusion that a mere threat of entry is sufficient to constrain anti-competitive effects 
has been criticized, and we will not adopt it here. See United States v. United Tote, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 1064, 1081 (D. Del. 1991) 
(noting that interpreting Baker Hughes as encouraging a lax standard is inconsistent with the critical examination of potential 
entrant's ability to restrain competition); see also 4 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of 
 [**34] Antitrust Principles and Their Application P 941h (2d ed. 2000) (criticizing Baker Hughes' lax standards that favor 
respondents) (""Areeda & Hovenkamp""); Darren Bush & Salvatorre Massa, ""Rethinking the Potential Competition Doctrine,"" 2004 
WIS. L. REV. 1035, 1074-79 (2004). Morever, there is a high threshold applied to assertions as to whether a company can be 
considered a potential entrant for anti-trust purposes. See 2A Areeda & Hovenkamp, at P 422 (""The more concentrated the 
market and the greater the threat posted by the challenged practice, the more convincing must be the evidence of likely, timely, 
and effective entry.""). The burden of production must provide evidence that the likelihood of entry reaches a threshold ranging 
from ""reasonable probability"" to ""certainty."" CB&I's evidence does not approach either threshold so as to rebut the prima facie 
case. See BOC Intern'l v. FTC, 557 F.2d 24, 29 n.7 (2d Cir. 1977); FTC v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 549 F.2d 289, 294-295 (4th Cir. 
1977); Mercantile Texas Corp. v. Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., 638 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir. 1981). Therefore, the 
Commission had substantial evidence to conclude that CB&I failed to rebut the  [**35] prima facie case, because there is no 
such evidence that the threat of potential entrants will constrain the acquisition's anti-competitive effects. "
112,11," HN26[
] Merger Guidelines are often used as persuasive authority when deciding if a particular acquisition violates anti-trust 
laws. See United States v. Kinder, 64 F.3d 757, 771 (2d Cir. 1995)."
112,12," HN27[
] Long-term trends in HHI changes can be used to examine the structure of markets and are used to determine the 
effect of mergers on the market. See State of N. Y. v. Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 321, 362 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Here, the 
market trends in HHIs provide substantial evidence that CB&I and PDM have been the dominant players in the relevant markets 
and do not indicate any trend of reduced concentration; rather, a merger accelerates the trend towards increased concentration, 
as its previous competitors have dropped out of the relevant markets. Id. "
114,13," Moreover, as we noted earlier in supra note 11, HN31[
] the Merger Guidelines are not binding on the courts and the agency 
during adjudication but are only highly persuasive authorities as a ""benchmark of legality."" See United States v. Kinder, 64 F.3d 
757, 771 & n.22 (2d Cir. 1995) (""Although it is widely acknowledged that the Merger Guidelines do not bind the judiciary in 
determining whether to sanction a corporate merger or acquisition for anticompetitive effect, courts commonly cite them as a 
benchmark of legality.""). The Merger Guidelines do not guide adjudicative decisions at the agency and court-level, because they 
are merely enforcement policy statements that establish standards for exercising prosecutorial discretion. Id.; see also Native 
Am. Arts, Inc. v. Waldron Corp., 399 F.3d 871, 874 (7th Cir. 2005); Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. at 41553 § 0. Enforcement 
 [**46] policy is not binding on the agency and has no force of law. See Olin Corp., 986 F.2d at 1300 (""Certainly the [Merger] 
Guidelines are not binding on the courts . . . or, for that matter, on the Commission."") (emphasis added); Brock v. Cathedral 
Bluffs Shale Oil Co., 254 U.S. App. D.C. 242, 796 F.2d 533, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also Nat'l Wrestling Coaches Ass'n v. 
Dep't of Educ., 363 U.S. App. D.C. 239, 383 F.3d 1047, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 2004); cf. Ash Grove Cement Co. v. F. T. C., 577 F.2d 
1368, 1374 (9th Cir. 1978). CB&I's citation to Nevins v. NLRB, 796 F.2d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1986) is inapposite. Nevins deals with 
guidelines concerning the adjudicatory function within the NLRB context, but the Merger Guidelines deal with the enforcement 
function of the agency and are explicitly denoted as non-binding. Enforcement, unlike adjudication, is also an area the courts are 
""most reluctant to interfere."" See Brock, 796 F.2d at 538."
114,14," Even so, the Merger Guidelines delegate much discretion in the application of these rules and reject a ""mechanical 
application"" of the Guidelines. Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. at 41552. The Merger Guidelines urge the Commission to ""apply 
[the Guidelines'] standards reasonably and flexibly to the particular  [**47] facts and circumstances of each proposed merger."" 
Id. "
115,15," HN34[
] Just allowing entrants to win bids does not guarantee the entrants would be able to enter the market permanently, 
since winning a bid does not necessarily result in the successful completion of the project  [**50] especially in light of evidence 
that CB&I controls skilled laborers necessary for success that other competitors do not have."
115,16," In addition, for the reasons we noted in Section II.3.C.i, supra,  this post-acquisition evidence is likely not very probative, 
because it can arguably be subject to manipulation. "
117,17," The Commission concluded that 101 of the factors work together to help form CB&I's reputation for quality and reliability."" Op. 
at 58. HN39[
] Reputation here can be considered an industry-specific ""entrenched buyer preferencel] for [an] established 
brand[]"" built into the industry-specific bid process. See, e.g., Am. Council for Certified Podiatric Physicians and Surgeons v. Am. 
Board of Podiatric Surgery, Inc., 185 F.3d 606, 623 (6th Cir. 1999) (""[E]stablishing credibility naturally seems to be a significant 
barrier to entry, particularly for an enterprise that depends heavily upon reputation, such as certification of medical specialists.""); 
Los Angeles Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1428 n.4 (9th Cir. 1993) (""The main sources of entry barriers are: . . . (3) 
entrenched buyer preferences for established brands or company reputations."") (emphasis added); cf. FMC Corp., 170 F.3d at 
531 (""The question is not whether there are barriers to entry, but rather whether the barriers in a particular industry are large 
enough to trigger judicial concern."") (emphasis added). District courts  [**58] have also so held. See, e.g., Cardinal Health, Inc., 
12 F. Supp. 2d at 57 (""The sheer economies of scale and strength of reputation that the Defendants already have over these 
wholesalers serve as barriers to competitors as they attempt to grow significantly in size.""); United States v. Franklin Elec. Co., 
Inc., 130 F. Supp. 2d 1025, 1031-032 (W.D. Wis. 2000); see generally United Tote, Inc., 768 F. Supp. at 1075, 1079-81 (""In 
reality, the weight accorded to reputational barriers to entry will vary with the circumstances of a given case.""). "
119,18," CB&I cites to Reynolds Metals Co. v. FTC, 114 U.S. App. D.C. 2, 309 F.2d 223, 230-231 (D.C. Cir. 1962), to suggest the 
Commission failed to distinguish between after-acquired properties and before-acquired properties as  [**69] in Reynolds. In 
Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 136-137, 87 S. Ct. 932, 17 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1967), the 
Supreme Court assumed after-acquired assets may be included in the divestiture order, though the Court in Cascade Natural 
Gas remanded the case for an additional hearing on how assets should be divided. Here, instead of a hearing, the Commission 
devolved authority to decide what assets will be involved in the divestiture to CB&I and the monitor trustee. Permitting the 
respondent and a trustee to decide, instead of holding another court hearing, is within HN47[
] the Commission's broad 
authority to fashion relief. The Commission's remedy in this case is also possibly a superior and more efficient method to resolve 
the issue. "
120,19," We also find the Commission's detailed decisions in both its Opinion and Decision on Petition for Reconsideration where 
remedy issues were discussed, see, e.g., R.O., at 23-24, as providing adequate reasons justifying the remedy and its 
relationship with its objectives. Unlike in United States v. Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2001), 
which remanded due to the lack of an adequate explanation for the remedy, the Commission provided much more in form and 
substance  [**70] than a ""mere four paragraphs"" to explain its remedy."
120,20," Even assuming CB&I was surprised by the extent of the remedy, HN49[
] surprise itself does not merit reversal without 
allegations of prejudice. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 103; Eli Lilly & Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, 460 F.2d 1096, 1106 (5th Cir. 
1972) (""[S]urprise alone is not a sufficient basis for appellate reversal; appellant must also show that the procedures followed 
resulted in prejudice.""). CB&I does not present any argument ""that the lack of notice caused the complaining party to withhold 
certain proof which would show his entitlement to relief on the merits,"" thus we cannot reverse based on allegations of surprise 
alone. Id. "
123,1," The factual allegations in the Complaint are taken to be true for the purposes of the USGA's Motion to Dismiss. Hamm v. 
Groose, 15 F.3d 110, 112 (8th Cir. 1994)."
123,2," A court ""may take judicial notice of judicial opinions and public records."" Stutzka v. McCarville, 420 F.3d 757, 761 n.2 (8th Cir. 
2005). The USGA asserts this court can take judicial notice of background facts described in Weight-Rite. Def.'s Mem. in Supp. 
of Mot. to Dismiss [Docket No. 10] at 4 n.1. Windage did not oppose judicial notice in its brief. This Court takes judicial notice of 
the background of the USGA as recited in the Weight-Rite decision."
123,3, The USGA's decisions have not been made a part of the record. 
125,4," Because Windage has not adequately alleged an agreement, it is unnecessary to address the USGA's argument  [*12] that 
Windage has not sufficiently pleaded a relevant market or an antitrust injury. "
128,1," Settling Plaintiffs are Mike Mertaban, Dennis Warner, Charles Cleve, and Liz Hart."
128,2," Plaintiffs consist of the Settling Plaintiffs, plus Andre Fleury. Class counsel initially represented Andre Fleury but later withdrew 
from the representation, with the permission of the Court, after counsel and Andre Fleury disagreed about the fairness, 
adequacy, and reasonableness of the settlement. See Docket No. 143 (order, filed on 8/27/07). Andre Fleury has chosen to opt 
out of the settlement."
128,3," ""The Supreme Court has developed a unique per se rule for illegal tying arrangements. For a tying claim to suffer per se 
condemnation, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant tied together the sale of two distinct products or services; (2) that the 
defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying product market to coerce its customers into purchasing the tied 
product; and (3) that the tying arrangement affects a 'not insubstantial volume of commerce' in the tied product market."" 
Cascade, 515 F.3d at 913. Even if a ""tying arrangement survives  [*5] per se scrutiny, it still must be assessed for invalidity under the rule of reason. [P] The 
Supreme Court has explained that 'the inquiry mandated by the Rule of Reason is whether the challenged agreement is one that 
promotes competition or one that suppresses competition.'"" County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Community Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 
1158 (9th Cir. 2001). "
129,4," Richemont disputes that this was a new policy. It claims that, ""[s]ince at least 1987, [it] has consistently maintained a policy of 
refusing to sell watch parts to unauthorized dealers for use in servicing Cartier watches."" Docket No. 181 (2d Jacquenoud Decl. 
P 12). "
130,5," As discussed below, ultimately, the Court appointed only Mr. Mertaban, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Cleves as representatives of the 
watchmaker subclass. The Court never appointed Andre Fleury as a representative for the watchmaker subclass. In an order 
that was issued after preliminary approval, the Court rejected Andre Fleury's argument that he should be appointed a 
representative because, inter alia, papers he had filed in the past suggested that he sought monetary compensation which was 
unique to him, was unrealistic, and conflicted with the interests of the class as a whole. See Docket No. 202 (order, filed on 
11/29/2007). "
131,6," The consumer subclass was defined as all persons who currently own or previously owned a Cartier watch and who had their 
Cartier watch repaired or serviced in the United States at a Richemont-owned Cartier boutique or directly by Richemont at any 
time between January 1, 2003 and November 28, 2007. The watchmaker subclass was defined as all watchmakers or watch repairers in the United States operating as of November 28, 
2007, which are not authorized Cartier dealers or authorized Cartier repair shops as of November 28, 2007."
131,7," Based on the declaration submitted on behalf of the Settlement Administrator, see Docket No. 229 (Keough Decl. P 4 & Ex. A), 
the Court finds that, in compliance with the notice provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 1715, Richemont 
served timely notice of the settlement to the appropriate federal and state officials. "
132,8, See Docket No. 229 (Keough Decl. P 10 & Ex. B) (long-form notice).

133,11," In their proposed order, the Settling Parties recognize only 4 opt-outs by consumers -- i.e., Nada Eldib, Natalie Minh Nguyen, 
Martin Samuel, and James J. Shea, Jr. See Docket No. 275 (Proposed Final Order, Ex. B). However, Richemont has admitted 
that Lucy McGrath, Giti Underhill, and L.S. Youngblood could be considered valid opt-outs because they had only ""technical 
flaws"" with their requests for exclusion. See Docket No. 242 (Def.'s Sum. Br. at 4-5). The Court shall also recognize the opt-out 
by July and Richard Cole because they too had only a technical flaw with their request for exclusion (i.e., sending the request to 
settlement counsel instead of GCG directly), and there is no evidence that Richemont would be prejudiced as a result."
133,12, See Docket No. 229 (Keough Decl. P 14 & Ex. C) (publication notice). 
134,13," On its website, the AWCI describes itself as ""an international not-for-profit trade association dedicated to the advancement of 
horology."" http://www.awci.com (last visited June 27, 2008). None of the parties have suggested posting by any organization 
other than AWCI, which appears to be the major organization for horologists."
134,14," These requests for exclusion were made by the following: American Watch Service (c/o Gonzalo Sanin); Peter Baier (Swiss-
Time Ltd.); Remy Battain; Alain Baume (Baume Swiss Jewelers); Jean Bernhard; Richard Cuny; Dion's World of Watches (c/o 
Dion Zaniewski); Michael Donnellan; Michael Graham; Rob Hays; Paul Highfill; James Hill; Tim Hills; Rudolf Hoellein; John

Ryser; John Safranek; Jeffrey Schiller; Gerald Schumaker; Herb Self; Paul Shibata; David B. Sydney; Tick Tock Shoppe (Stan 
Palen); David Walter; and Jerry Watson."
134,15," These  [*27] objections came from Jon W. Horton, see Docket Nos. 215-16; James Sadilek, see Docket No. 218; and Sacha 
Fleury. See Docket No. 224. The Court also received a communication from David Christianson, see Docket No. 217, but it was 
not clear whether Mr. Christianson intended to object to or opt out of the settlement. Out of an abundance of caution, the Court 
instructed that the supplemental notice described infra be sent to him. See Docket No. 257 (order, filed on 5/9/2007). "
135,16," The watchmakers in the Fleury submission who were not given the supplemental notice were (1) those who were not U.S. 
watchmakers (and hence not part of the class) and (2) those who were duplicative of requests for exclusion and/or objections 
submitted directly to GCG. All others (including the ""premature"" alleged opt-outs) were provided the supplemental notice. "
136,17," Before certification is proper for any purpose, including settlement, the Court must ensure the requirements of Rule 23(a) 
 [*34] and (b) have been met. See Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168, 1176 (9th Cir. 2007); Denney v. Deutsche Bank, 
A.G., 443 F.3d 253, 270 (2d Cir. 2006)."
136,18, Rule 23(a) provides that [o]ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). 
137,19," The Court notes that Andre Fleury did not attach to his declaration any documents from the Department of Labor 
substantiating such. The Court also notes that, in his previous filings, Andre Fleury claimed that there are approximately 6,000 
independent watchmakers. See Docket No. 165 (letter, filed on 9/25/2007); Docket No. 173 (letter, filed on 10/11/2007). "
139,20," In Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit indicated its agreement with this statement in GMC. 
See id. at 960. "
143,21," Contrary to what Sacha Fleury claims, the declaration of Andre Fleury, see Docket No. 248, does not address the tooling. See 
Docket No. 249 (Sacha Fleury Obj. at 6). In a letter filed with the Court on September 25, 2007, Andre Fleury did represent to the Court that he has ""repaired Cartier 
watches for 40 years and no special tools were ever proposed to me,"" Docket No. 165 (letter), but that statement was not 
provided under penalty of perjury. Andre Fleury also represented in the letter that another watchmaker, Jean Bernhard, ""was 
contracted by Cartier [International] [in 1994 and 1995] to repair 280 of their watches [and] no tools were given, suggested, or 
proposed to him,"" id., but that statement too was not provided under penalty of perjury. Nor was the letter allegedly sent by Mr. 
Bernhard authenticated. Even if it were, the letter constitutes hearsay and has marginal relevance since Mr. Bernhard was 
discussing events more than a decade old. Similarly, the letter filed by Andre Fleury on October 11, 2007, also was not submitted under penalty of perjury. See Docket No. 
173 (filed on 10/11/2007). "
144,22," Andre Fleury provided watchmakers with a form to fill out, which included in part the following statement: ""Due to Cartier's 
parts restriction I had to turn away     Cartier repairs yearly."" "
145,23," The Court notes that, of the potential objectors in the Fleury submission who were given the supplemental notice and an 
opportunity to clarify their intent, only 60 chose to opt out. See Part I.D.2, supra. "
149,1," From now on, I will refer to the amended complaint simply as the ""complaint."" "
152,2," Because, as I will discuss below, count I for tortious interference will be dismissed, and count III for injunctive relief thus rests 
entirely on the Donnelly Act claim, this question concerns only count II, under the Donnelly Act."
152,3," In deciding this question, I did not consider the parties' unsolicited supplemental papers discussing the scope of damages 
sought in the arbitration. "
153,4," See Sullivan & Cromwell LLP v. Charney, 15 Misc 3d 1128[A], 841 NYS2d 222, 2007 NY Slip Op 50889[U], *4 [Sup. Ct. Apr 
30, 2007]. "
154,5," Consequently, I do not need to address defendants' arguments that the tortious interference claim is barred by the three-year 
statute of limitations or should be stayed. "
156,6," Because all allegations in this regard are dismissed, I do not reach the issue of the forum selection clause. "
160,7," Since plaintiff has not alleged that Equitas's conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Donnelly Act, I will not consider 
whether it might.Per se violations are those actions that, ""because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any "
161,," redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise 
harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use."" Northwest Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 289 (quoting  [***44] Northern 
Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958)). A plaintiff seeking application of the per se 
rule must present a threshold case that the challenged activity falls into a category likely to have predominantly anticompetitive 
effects."" Id. at 298. "
162,8," Private civil actions to enforce the Sherman Act are allowed under § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. See Nelson, 925 
F.2d at 1562. "
183,1," As Defendant's Motion merely references in passing Plaintiff's Clayton Act and New Jersey Antitrust Act claims in Counts Four 
and Five, the Court will not address the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleadings under these counts at this juncture. (See, Def.'s Mot. 
Dismiss  [*15] at 15 & n.3, 39, 40.) Nevertheless, the Court recognizes that relevant market and antitrust injury are essential 
elements to pleading any antitrust claim (see Sections A(1) and A(4), infra). "
184,2," See In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation, wherein the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, and subsequently 
rejected its relevant market contention that substitutability was improperly plead. In re Hypodermic Prods. Antitrust Litig., 2007 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47438, 2007 WL 1959225, at *10. "
185,3," Defendant addresses Plaintiff's allegations of exclusionary conduct, bundling and tie-in arrangements in its challenge of Counts 
Two and Three, but asserts that its arguments apply equally to its Count One challenge. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss at 37, n. 11.) Thus, 
it is appropriate to assess the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleadings regarding such practices in its Count Two and Three analysis."
185,4," Defendant alternatively argues that even if Plaintiff satisfies the plausibility standard, it does not have standing to bring such a 
claim because it fails to sufficiently plead antitrust injury as a result of the LendingTree agreement. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss at 37-
38.) This contention will be addressed under Section B(4), infra."
185,5," To the extent that Defendant's contentions under Counts Two and Three also apply to Plaintiff's allegations under Count One 
(as noted above in Section B(2)), this Court's findings shall apply, in turn, to Defendant's Count One challenge. "
187,6," In an abundance of caution, this Court grants BanxCorp the opportunity to replead its §§1 and 2 Sherman Act claims under 
Counts One, Two, and Three, but if sufficient information to address the Complaint's cited deficiencies are not alleged in the 
amended complaint, BanxCorp's Sherman Act claims may be subject to dismissal with prejudice. "
190,1," Abbott quotes ARC America for the proposition that ""state law cannot 'provide a remedy for the federal violation that federal law 
forbids.'"" Defs.' Reply Br. at 1. However, the quoted passage is from a portion of the decision in which the Court ""ma[de] it clear 
exactly what the issue [was] before"" it. ARC Am., 490 U.S. at 100. In clarifying that the decision addressed only whether Illinois 
Brick's ""rule limiting recoveries under the Sherman Act also prevents indirect purchasers from recovering damages flowing from 
violations of state law, despite express state statutory provisions giving such purchasers a damages cause of action,"" the Court 
noted that ""there is no claim here that state law could provide a remedy for the federal violation that federal law forbids."" Id. 
(emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court did not address the issue presented by Abbott's motion."
190,2," Plaintiffs argue that Abbott's conduct may be ""unfair"" even if it is not ""unlawful,"" and thus they have an independent UCL claim 
regardless of whether Abbott violated the Sherman Act. See Cel-Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, "
191,180," , 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). This late stage of the litigation is the first time Plaintiffs have made such a 
contention and, in any event, their argument appears to be foreclosed by California case law. See, e.g., SC Manufactured 
Homes, Inc. v. Liebert, 162 Cal. App. 4th 68, 93, 76 Cal. Rptr. 3d 73 (2008) (""If the same conduct is alleged to be both an 
antitrust violation and an 'unfair' business act or practice for the same reason -- because it unreasonably restrains competition 
and harms consumers -- the determination that the conduct is not an unreasonable restraint of trade necessarily implies that the 
conduct is not 'unfair' toward consumers."") (quoting Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp., 93 Cal. App. 4th 363, 375, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 175 
(2001)). "
193,1," The specific categories of annuities at issue are the Bonus Maxxx, BonusDex, Bonus Maxxx Elite, BonusDex Elite, 10% Bonus 
PowerDex Elite, and MasterDex 10."
193,2," With respect to Allianz's annuities, the cash value would also be paid if the policyholder elected to begin receiving annuity 
payments before the conclusion of the deferral period or over a shorter period of time than the minimum payout period. "
195,3," Those attorneys are the law firms of Gianelli & Morris, Ernst and Mattison, and the Law Office of Ronald Marron."
195,4," Allianz filed  [*12] its request for extended oral argument via ex parte application. The application was granted in part in the 
form of an extended an argument but denied in part because the Court would not allow Allianz to introduce live witness 
testimony. "
196,5," Plaintiffs filed a number of objections to the evidence submitted by defendant. (Doc. Nos. 196 (MSJ) & 211 (Decert.).) The 
Court only considered admissible evidence in resolving the present motions. Where the Court's Order cites evidence to which 
plaintiffs have objected, the objection is impliedly overruled. "
197,6," Allianz also references a motion to intervene that the DOI was going to file in this action. (See Memo. ISO MSJ at 36 & Def. 
Exhibit 37.) However, from a review of the docket, the DOI never actually filed that motion, and Magistrate Judge Bencivengo 
vacated the telephonic discovery conference on the motion when the parties reported that the issue had been resolved. "
198,7," Compare Opp. to MSJ, at 19 & n.21 (tying accrual to application of surrender penalties and reduction of yields in second policy 
year because damages or loss is the last essential element of the pled causes of action) with Opp. to Decert., at 27 (""Plaintiffs' 
damages stem from depositing their monies in Allianz' annuities"") and Decert. Tr., at 27:12-21 & 28:5-16 (arguing that fraud 
accrual date ""would depend on when [plaintiffs] had notice of the truth"" and that no such notice was provided until this action 
was filed, but also suggesting that date of purchase would create the kind of ""bright line"" to make this action appropriate for 
ongoing classwide adjudication). "
199,8," The first oral argument supports this finding. When asked what legally cognizable damages  [*24] Mr. Iorio and the other 
plaintiffs suffered, plaintiffs' counsel responded, ""[Allianz] took their money. They were promised a bonus. They were promised 
an interest rate. Based on that, they gave their money to the defendant."" (MSJ Tr., at 26:6-9.)"
199,9," Of course, the nondisclosure of these facts within the four corners of the policy leads to the Court's finding post that this portion 
of plaintiffs' breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law because it duplicates the claim for omission-based fraud. "
200,10," A close review of the Iorio declaration reveals that Mr. Iorio would not have purchased his  [*29] annuity if he had ""known 
about any of the[] negative aspects"" of his Bonus Maxxx annuity. (Iorio Decla. P 3 (emphasis added).) Mr. Iorio's declaration fails 
to say that he would not have purchased the annuity if Allianz had drafted its policy in compliance with the senior notice 
provisions in the California Insurance Code. Therefore, the phrase ""lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition"" 
properly carries a meaning in the ""unlawful"" prong of the UCL claim different from its meaning in the ""fraudulent"" prong of the 
UCL claim. Because the Court finds that, for the ""unlawful"" prong of Mr. Iorio's UCL claims, the statute of limitations began to accrue on the 
date of surrender (therefore making Mr. Iorio's filing timely), the Court need not reach the argument of plaintiffs' counsel at the 
decertification hearing that ""there is continuing damage every time that [Allianz] commit[s] the unfair practice, every time [it 
doesn't] pay the correct yield, every time [it] take[s] surrender charges[.]"" (Decert. Tr., at 27:25—28:2.) Plaintiffs' counsel made 
this argument for the first time at the hearing and did not cite to any specific legal authority for this proposition. "
201,11," Because Mr. Iorio's misrepresentation-based fraud claim is time-barred, the Court only considers arguments relevant to Ms. 
Scheffer and Mr. Freifield under this prong. "
202,12," On an earlier page, the brochure rhetorically asked the prospective customer, ""What if you could see your money increase 
immediately?""  [*37] (Pls. Exhibit 31, at 465.) "
203,13," As Allianz bluntly states the point, ""[i]t strains credulity that prospective policy holders thought they could pay Allianz Life a 
$10,000 premium on Monday, immediately be credited with a $1,000 bonus, and surrender the policy for $11,000 on Tuesday."" 
(Memo. ISO Motion, at 23:1-3.) "
204,14," Because Mr. Iorio's concealment-based fraud claim is not time-barred, the Court considers arguments relevant to all three 
plaintiffs under this prong. "
205,15," To the extent that Allianz's reply relies on Sayer v. Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. for the proposition that its 
nondisclosures were immaterial (see Reply ISO MSJ, at 12), the Court finds that the Sayer court squarely grounded its holding 
on the absence of a duty to disclose. Therefore, the Court addresses Sayer in the duty section of the analysis. "
207,16," At trial, plaintiffs will still  [*58] be able to recover the legally cognizable damages for these material omissions as part of their 
fraud claim. Here, the Court is merely prohibiting plaintiffs from recasting those same allegations as a claim for breach of 
contract. "
208,17," The required notice language reads as follows (all caps omitted): Important You have purchased a life insurance policy or annuity contract. Carefully review it for limitations. This policy may be returned within 30 days from the date you received it for a full refund by returning it to the insurance 
company or agent who sold you this policy. After 30 days, cancellation may result in a substantial penalty, known as a 
surrender charge. Cal. Ins. Code § 10127.10(c)."
208,18," Indeed, Allianz effectively concedes that it did not strictly comply with the statute: ""[t]he disclosure on Mr. Iorio's Bonus Maxxx 
annuity . . . complies in all material respects with the substance of the required notice."" (Memo. ISO MSJ, at 29 n. 19.) "
213,19," Throughout Allianz's arguments for decertification, it makes reference to the deposition testimony of plaintiffs' expert, Edward 
Finegan, Ph.D. The Court declines to treat as an expert opinion the portions of Dr. Finegan's testimony wherein he responded to 
Allianz's hypotheticals concerning the effect of oral representations by Allianz's sales agents on annuity purchasers' 
understanding of policy terms. Dr. Finegan, a linguistics professor and legal writing instructor at the University of Southern 
California, is offering an expert opinion in this case concerning the ability of the ordinary reader to understand the policies based 
on a review of the written materials alone. (Opp. to Decert., at 21-22; Pls. Decert. Exhibit 17, at 249:11-23.) Therefore, any 
Allianz citation to Dr. Finegan's deposition  [*79] is cumulative of, and redundant with, other evidence in support of the argument 
that individualized questions predominate in this action and preclude its maintenance as a class action."
213,20," As clarified by Allianz's counsel at oral argument, ""If I can make one point today it is this: You can't presume reliance for the 
individual representatives who are in front of you. That's not fair. They have to actually demonstrate reliance, and then potentially 
you can presume reliance for the rest of the class."" (Decert. Tr., at 19:8-12.) In a subsequent colloquy about the Mirkin rule, 
counsel reiterated, ""You can't presume reliance for the class representatives. The class representatives have to demonstrate 
actual reliance. . . . Once you get to that point, then they represent the class, and you can potentially presume reliance for the 
rest of the class. That is up to the jury to decide, I suppose."" (Id. at 20:6-11.) "
214,21," Allianz also discusses a statement in the SOU representing that the agent ""ha[s] not made statements that differ from the 
disclosure form[.]"" Allianz accuses plaintiffs of construing this statement to mean that the sales agent spent the entire time during 
the sales presentation reciting the disclosure form to the prospective purchaser. Allianz argues that this phrase instead means 
the sales agent did not make promises that contradict or misrepresent the actual annuity terms. The sales agent's signature of 
the SOU leaves open the possibility—indeed, the near certainty—that each sales agent presented each class member with a 
different mix of information. The Court finds this argument to be a red herring from the issue on which class certification hinges, 
i.e., whether the lead plaintiffs received and relied on written materials uniformly containing the promise of a 10% immediate 
bonus."
214,22," Tellingly, at oral argument, when the Court asked Allianz's counsel when it would ever  [*83] be appropriate to certify a class 
of defrauded consumers, counsel replied, ""Your Honor, I think it is fair to say that in the ann[a]ls of class litigation, . . . generally 
speaking, in both state and federal courts fraud cases are not capable of being classed."" (Decert. Tr., at 10:9-13.) "
215,23," Alternatively, plaintiffs are stating that they considered Allianz's nondisclosures to be material.  [*86] Since affirmative 
misrepresentations, rather than concealed nondisclosures, form the basis of the class certified by Judge Gonzalez, the Court 
need not analyze the declarations as they relate to the nondisclosures. "
216,24," In addition to challenging the presumption of actual reliance, Allianz also asks the Court not to apply a presumption of justified 
reliance. See Gartin v. S&M NuTec LLC, 245 F.R.D. 429, 438 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (finding that issue of justifiable reliance was 
controlled by individual questions, even if presumption of reliance hypothetically applied). However, in Vasquez, the court held, 
""[i]f the court finds that a reasonable man would have relied upon the alleged misrepresentations, an inference of justifiable 
reliance by each class member would arise."" 4 Cal. 3d at 814 n.9. Therefore, based  [*91] on the Court's findings supra in the 
summary judgment analysis, a presumption of justifiable reliance is also appropriate at this stage of the litigation."
216,25," Interestingly, the Central District of California has certified a class action against Allianz for RICO mail fraud (the same cause 
of action under consideration in Poulos) on the basis of plaintiffs' receipt of ""standardized consumer brochures and SOUs"" and 
signatures on the SOU affirming that they had read and understood the written materials. The standardized written presentations 
plus the plaintiffs' purchases of allegedly overpriced annuities satisfied the proximate causation element of mail fraud. See 
Negrete v. Allianz Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 238 F.R.D 482, 492 (C.D. Cal. 2006). "

224,3," Plaintiffs allege that several other Tyco practices, while not independent violations of the Sherman Act, contributed to the 
Plaintiffs' injury. "
225,4," At the Court's request, the parties submitted a Joint  [*6] Submission Re: Patents on June 9, 2008 describing the patents that 
cover OxiMax technology. The relevance of these patents is discussed in greater detail in Section III.B, infra."
225,5," The Court mentions the previous case because, as initially filed, Plaintiffs' complaint concentrated on the overcharges that 
purchasers incurred on pulse oximetry systems resulting from Tyco's foreclosure of Masimo. Plaintiffs intended to invoke 
collateral estoppel to establish several factual issues, such as ""the appropriate relevant product in geographic markets, the 
extent of Tyco's conduct, and [whether it was] violative of Section 2 [and] Section 1 of the Sherman Act [and] the various 
components or types of conduct that gave rise to the liability -- the bundling contracts, the exclusive dealing contracts, [and] the 
co-marketing agreements with O.E.M.s."" March 2, 2006 Scheduling Conference Tr. at 16:22-17:7. "
227,6," Plaintiffs, citing Prof. Frech's report, highlight an additional reason why hospitals seeking to terminate market-share agreement 
or deviate from its terms may not be able to do so. Pls.' Opp. at 23 n.17 (""If the buyer purchases a competitor's product that will 
make the buyer non-[compliant] with the terms of the exclusionary agreement, the buyer will forfeit access to the lower price 
level. Thus, the cost of that decision is not only the nominal price of the competitor's product, but opportunity cost of the foregone 
savings on all other purchases from the dominant producer."") (citing Opper Decl., Exh. 4 (Frech Expert Report P119)). However, 
Prof. Frech provides a single example: the scenario in which a hospital violates the requirement to maintain a certain percentage 
of Tyco-branded monitors. See id. (Frech Expert Report P120) (""If the hospital replaces [a monitor] with a non-Tyco oximeter, it 
loses the 37 percent discount off list price not just for sensors it uses with that machine,  [*14] but also on sensors used with the 
other…Tyco oximeters in its installed base.""). This is irrelevant to the issue of whether the market-share compliance requirement 
as to sensors is anticompetitive. Here, Plaintiffs complain only about Tyco's practices with regards to sensors, no matter how 
relevant monitors may be in practice. "
228,7," In their opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the jury finding that anticompetitive harm ceased in July 2001 means only that Tyco's 
anticompetitive impact on Masimo ended at that time -- and therefore, the jury verdict is evidence that Tyco's contracting 
practices still have anticompetitive effect on the oximetry market today. They note that after a retrial of the damages issue in 
Masimo,  [*16] this Court stated that regardless of whether July 2001 was a watershed for Masimo, ""the record before the jury 
did not unambiguously establish July 2001 as a watershed for the oximetery market."" Masimo Corp. v. Tyco Health Care Group, 
L.P., No. CV 02-4770 MRP, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98990, *12 (C.D. Cal. June 6, 2007). However, the Court's damages order 
pertained only to Masimo, not the oximetry market at large. It qualified the jury's factual finding regarding July 2001 in only one 
respect: by holding that Masimo was entitled to some measure of damages for sales of sensors lost after July 2001 that were 
tied to sales of sockets (monitors) that were lost before July 2001. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98990 at *13. It did not contradict the 
temporal limitation on anticompetitive harm found in Masimo."

Undisp. Facts P159."
228,9," Specifically, Tyco compensates buyers for reduced choice by ""shar[ing] part of the rent gained from the…monopoly power 
resulting from the exclusionary agreement."" Opper Decl., Exh. 4 (Frech Expert Report P117). "
229,10," Nor is Plaintiffs' case aided by their citation to Professor Einer Elhauge, Loyalty Discounts and Naked Exclusion, John M. Olin 
Center for Law, Economics, and Business, Discussion Paper No. 608, February 2008. Professor Elhague's article, which 
appears to depart from much of the current literature, argues that loyalty discounts such as market-share arrangements always 
(or almost always) have anticompetitive effects. See, e.g., Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 
1997) (""There are, however, well-recognized economic benefits to exclusive dealing arrangements, including the enhancement 
of interbrand competition.""). However, his work is unpublished (and thus may not have attained its final form) and highly 
theoretical.  [*20] As Plaintiffs have failed to explain why this theory, which differs in significant ways from Dr. Frech's, should be 
applicable to their particular real-world situation, the Court declines to consider it here."
229,11," These considerations include factors such as the need for uniformity in training, service, and compatibility. Pls.' Stmt. of Gen. 
Issues P34."
229,12," Despite its prominence in their overall case, Plaintiffs no longer allege that the Co-OP program is an independent practice that 
violates Section 1 or any other provision of the antitrust laws. See Compl. Also, it is worth noting that the jury in Masimo 
determined that Tyco's equipment financing programs were lawful. See Masimo, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29977, at *4. "
230,13," Plaintiffs present minor corrections to Tyco's evidence. For example, they note that Amerinet had a dual source, not a multi-
source,  [*25] agreement from 2002-2006, and that Premier has a multi-source agreement, not a dual-source agreement. Pls.' 
Stmt. of Gen. Issues PP20, 21. Plaintiffs further note that, despite the easy terminability of sole-source contracts, switching from 
sole-source to dual source would come at a cost to GPOs because Tyco paid a 3% administrative fee for sole-source contracts 
but only 2% for dual source. Pls.' Stmt. of Gen. Issues P28. See generally Opper Decl., Exh. 4 (Frech Expert Report P46) 
(""GPOs typically collect revenue from administrative fees paid to them by manufacturers""). However, the general trend away 
from sole-source contracts is not in dispute. See generally Opper Decl., Exh. 4 (Frech Expert Report P132) (""After Senate 
hearings on the anticompetitive nature of sole-source GPO contracting, several GPOs…began to offer dual- or multi-source 
contracts to their members."")"
230,14," Dr. Frech's original report states that Health Trust, as of 2002, imposed a requirement that its members not belong to any 
other GPO. Opper Decl. Exh. 4 (Frech Expert Report P136). Regardless of whether this is still the case, GPO members retain 
the choice not to purchase under the sole-source contract. "
231,15," More accurately, Brooke Group held that the plaintiff had to demonstrate that (i) the defendant's low prices were below an 
appropriate measure of its costs; and (ii) that the defendant had either a ""reasonable prospect,"" under the Robinson-Patman Act, 
or a ""dangerous probability,"" under § 2 of the Sherman Act, of recouping its ""investment""  [*28] in below-cost prices. 509 U.S. at 
224."
231,16," Notably,  [*30] market-share arrangements do not lock hospitals into affirmatively buying Tyco products and are terminable on 
short notice. "
232,17," Until the June 4, 2008 telephone conference with the parties, the record failed to describe the existence of patent protection on 
OxiMax in more than a conclusory fashion. When the Court expressed some surprise at this failing, both parties responded that 
it is undisputed that the OxiMax ""technology""  [*32] is patented by Tyco. June 4, 2008 Telephone Conference Tr. at 4:15-4:16, 
5:5-5:6. The Court again emphasizes that even if the general facts are undisputed, the details, disputed or not, are essential to 
understanding the reality of this case."
232,18," A very relevant question, in particular, is whether generic manufacturers can produce OxiMax-compatible sensors without 
infringing Tyco's patents. Generic sensor manufacturers would likely not be blocked by Tyco's patents on OxiMax monitor 
technology. It remains unclear whether they are blocked by the other OxiMax patents, and whether it is possible to create 
OxiMax-compatible sensors without implementing the features represented by those patents (which Plaintiffs claim lack real 
clinical value). If it is possible, for example, to create OxiMax adapters for R-Cal sensors without infringing Tyco's patents, Tyco's 
conduct would at most delay generic entry until such adapters could be produced, which is a slightly different theory that has 
clearly been rejected by the Ninth Circuit. See CalComp, 613 F.2d at 744 (stating that HN14[
] a monopolist has no obligation 
to provide its rivals with its new products for reverse-engineering and copying purposes).  [*33] Alternatively, if Tyco remains 
conducive to licensing its OxiMax technology then generic manufacturers could continue to compete in the sensor market, albeit 
with increased costs due to licensing fees."
232,19," Tyco appears to concede the presence of genuine issues of fact on the first factor under Section 2 -- in particular, the relevant 
product market definition of ""pulse oximetry consumables"" and whether Tyco possessed monopoly power in that market. For 
purposes of this motion, the Court views Tyco as a monopolist in a pulse oximetry consumables  [*34] product market. See 
Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255. The parties agree that the United States is the appropriate geographic market. "
234,20," Other cases following Oahu Gas apply a similar rule in different scenarios. See, e.g., City of Vernon, 955 F.2d at 1365; City of 
Anaheim v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir. 1992); High Technology Careers v. San Jose Mercury 
News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 1993)."
234,21," The Ninth Circuit affirmed the conclusion of the district court as consistent with Memorex and CalComp. It did not endorse that 
court's multi-factor balancing test."
234,22," Both parties marshal non-controlling authorities in support of their interpretation of the Ninth Circuit's rule. The D.C. Circuit, for 
example, consistent with the holdings in the series of IBM cases, recognizes that ""[a]s a general rule, courts are properly very 
skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm's product design changes."" United States v. 
Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, 65, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  [*41] Nonetheless, in that Circuit the existence of a 
legitimate, non-pretextual procompetitive justification does not end the inquiry. See id. at 59. Section 2 liability can still attach if 
plaintiff ""demonstrate[s] that the anticompetitive harm of the conduct outweighs the procompetitive benefit."" Id. See also In re 
Tricor Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 422 (D. Del. 2006) (""[A]s in Microsoft, if Plaintiffs show 
anticompetitive harm from the formulation changes, that harm will be weighed against any benefits presented by Defendants""). 
In contrast, the authors of a leading antitrust treatise -- previous versions of which are cited in CalComp and Oahu Gas -- ""would 
require evidence that the innovator knew before introducing the improvement into the market that it was absolutely no better 
than the prior version, and that the only purpose of the innovation was to eliminate the complementary product of a rival."" 
PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW, P776d, 258 (2d ed. 2002). Thus, ""[a]ny finding of a 
genuine product improvement should generally defeat the antitrust claim."" Id. P776d5, 264. "
235,23," This document is one of many that the parties cite as being probative of Tyco's intent in propagating OxiMax. The Court 
recognizes that Tyco's intent is a relevant consideration, and discusses it in Section III.B.3, infra."
235,24," The technology incorporated in Tyco's specialty sensors, MaxFast and SoftCare, is protected by separate patents. Joint 
Submission Re: Patents, at 2 n.1."
235,25," See, e.g., Xerox Corp. v. Media Sciences Int'l, Inc., 511 F. Supp. 2d 372, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (denying Xerox's motion to 
dismiss a Section 2 claim on the pleadings, citing the absence of a per se rule that introduction of patented product modification 
can never constitute prohibited anticompetitive conduct).  [*47] For the contrary view, see note 29, infra."
235,26," At the hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel responded to this point with the puzzling statement that ""the fact that Tyco got patents for the 
particular OxiMax system products is not a finding by the [PTO]…that the patented products are in any way an improvement 
over the existing technology,"" and that he did not think ""there was any determination by the [PTO] that [OxiMax] sensors…do 
something the previous sensors didn't do."" Hearing Tr. at 33:15-34:6. Basic principles of patent law contradict counsel's view. A "
236,," threshold requirement for a United States Patent is the invention or discovery of ""any new and useful process, machine, 
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof."" 35 U.S.C. § 101 (Patent Act). In this case, 
the issued patents here expressly reference R-Cal patents as prior art, so it appears that the PTO's patent grant on OxiMax 
sensor features is in fact a determination that the sensors did ""something the previous sensors didn't do."""
236,27," Plaintiffs also argue that a clinician can make the MaxFast sensor available to his patients by bringing in a stand-alone monitor 
and Tyco did not, therefore, have to convert every single monitor in the hospital to OxiMax. Hearing Tr. at 44:10-19. This 
argument becomes unavailing in view of the Section III.B.3, infra, which essentially concludes that Tyco did not ""convert"" anyone 
-- hospitals converted themselves. The Court will not penalize Tyco for hospitals' decisions to adopt more OxiMax monitors than 
necessary for their use of MaxFast. "
237,28," Plaintiffs' citation to  [*53] the Scharf deposition in Pls.' Stmt. of Gen. Issues P127 does not appear to reference the quoted 
text. See Opper Decl., Exh. 47 (Scharf Depo. at 80:5-13). The Court assumes that the Plaintiffs quote in P127 is accurate, but 
does not include an accurate cite to the deposition transcript."
237,29," This discussion assumes, once again, that the patents do not preclude the conclusion that the innovations are valueless or 
pretextual. See note 25, supra (citing the Xerox case and the absence of a bright line rule protecting a monopolist's introduction 
of a patented product design). Some courts suggest bright line rules barring Section 2 liability for patented product innovations. 
See, e.g., C.R. Bard v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Newman, J., dissenting) (""It was not Bard's changes 
to its biopsy gun or needles that affected M3's sale of replacement needles; it was the patents on these products. To hold that 
Bard could violate the Sherman  [*55] Act by changing these products, if M3's business was adversely affected, is a novel and 
pernicious theory of antitrust law that is contrary to the principles of competition, and fraught with litigation-generating 
mischief.""); Walgreen Co. v. AstraZeneca Pharm. L.P., 534 F. Supp. 2d 146, 151 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Areeda & Hovenkamp for 
the principle that Section 2 antitrust remedies ""should not be applied to monopolists who introduce new products under patents 
or, presumably, other official grants of exclusivity""). "
238,30," Not to belabor the point, but even if Dr. Ehrenwerth is correct that ""[t]he  [*57] medical device field is replete with instruments 
that had potential benefit, but the 'benefit' never materialized,"" Opper Decl., Exh. 8 (Ehrenwerth Rebuttal Decl. PP4-5), imposing 
antitrust liability on firms for introducing those instruments, where they had legitimate justifications for doing so, can only stunt 
the firms' product development processes. See AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, P776d, 264."
238,31," Plaintiffs show that the new OxiMax specialty sensors (SoftCare and MaxFast) represent a small (0.29%) portion of Tyco's 
OxiMax sales since January 2002. See Pls.' Summary Judgment Hearing Documents, Exh. 20 (""MaxFast and SoftCare Sensor 
Sales""). See also Opper Decl., Exh. 1 Table B1. Plaintiffs infer that the limited sales of the products reflects the ""little, if any, 
clinical innovation"" represented by the OxiMax platform. Pls.' Opp. at 18. Tyco offers the persuasive response that those 
customers that did purchase the 230,000 or so specialty sensors did so entirely out of their own free choice. In other words, in 
disputing the value of MaxFast and SoftCare, Plaintiffs have not suggested that any hospital was compelled to purchase these 
sensors over an alternative (or, indeed, that any alternative  [*58] exists). Thus, the purchases reflect the appeal of the specialty 
sensors. See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 421 (D. Del. 2006) (explaining that where 
consumers choose to purchase a product, a court should not second guess the products' value). "
239,32," Tyco contends that R-Cal-compatible monitors were available long after the R-Cal patent  [*60] expired. See Defs.' Mem. at 
10. Plaintiffs argue that regardless of whether Tyco was actually selling any R-Cal monitors, it had effectively discontinued the 
technology when it indicated to the market an intent to obsolete the R-Cal monitors in favor of OxiMax. See Pls.' Stmt. of Gen. 
Issues P129. The Court assumes, for purposes of this motion, that whatever Tyco did was effectively equivalent to discontinuing 
all production and support for R-Cal monitors."
239,33," See Hearing Tr. at 30:3-24 (agreeing that ""it is the change in the…monitor that creates the lock-out of generic manufacturers"")."
239,34," In some sense, Tyco's decision to obsolete R-Cal compatible technology is ""business  [*62] conduct"" subject to Oahu Gas and 
its progeny. See Oahu Gas, 838 F.2d at 368 (HN17[
] ""Where a monopolist's refusal to aid a competitor is based partially on a 
desire to restrict competition, we determine antitrust liability by asking whether there was a legitimate business justification for 
the monopolist's conduct.""). The conclusion here is equivalent to a finding that Tyco's decision to obsolete R-Cal technology is 
not subject to Section 2 liability because it is supported by the legitimate business justification that the company was moving to a 
newer, more sophisticated product design. "
240,35," Tyco contends that the patents covering this technology have expired. See Defs.' Stmt. of Undisp. Facts P139. Plaintiffs have 
not raised a genuine issue merely by responding that the patent expiration is ""speculative."" Pls.' Stmt. of Gen. Issues P139. 
They have not introduced or suggested any other patents that could prevent a company from manufacturing monitors with R-Cal 
technology. Moreover, Plaintiffs later state that ""Tyco's R-Cal patents expired in November, 2003."" Pls. Disp. Facts P5."
240,36," Plaintiffs have repeated this  [*66] view several times. See, e.g., Pls.' Opp. at 8 (describing the components of the ""OxiMax 
strategy""); id. at 24 (""[E]ven if Tyco's sole-source and market-share contracts are not found to be independently unlawful…their 
impact in conjunction with Tyco's conduct taken as a whole must be considered""); Hearing Tr. at 46:14-23; id. at 51:11-18 
(""We're also saying…that even if a jury finds that the use of that type of program was not in and of itself a discrete antitrust 
violation, to the extent that practice permitted Tyco to convery the market away from R-Cal monitors to the OxiMax monitors, that 
supports a finding by the jury that the OxiMax conversion strategy as planned and implemented was anticompetitive.""). "
241,37," The Court notes that Plaintiffs repeatedly excerpt from documents without providing any sense of context. Plaintiffs' citations 
rarely include when the document was written and whether it actually concerns OxiMax as currently on the market or 
predecessor technology (such as ""CoolBrite""). "
243,38," See, e.g., Hearing Tr. at 31:11-20 (commenting that regardless of what Plaintiffs did ""even the most brand loyal consumer 
would be entitled to the benefits of price competition if market-wide the effect of Tyco's exclusion of generic sensor 
manufacturers was to enable them to keep their R-Cal sensor prices higher than they would have been but for their 
anticompetitive conduct"")."
243,39," In view of this conclusion, the Court declines to address Tyco's arguments that Plaintiffs cannot show impact or damages. "

(citation omitted). "
251,2," In so holding, the Court overruled prior precedent that indicated tying arrangements involving patents provided presumptive 
market power. Illinois Tool Works Inc., 547 U.S. at 42. The Court traced the history of antitrust tying jurisprudence, observing 
that, in the earlier part of the 20th Century, the Court disapproved of such  [**17] arrangements. Id. at 33-34. The trend has 
changed. ""Over the years, however, this Court's strong disapproval of tying arrangements has substantially diminished."" Id. at 
35. A similar trend in antitrust law is seen in other relevant cases as well. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. 
PSKS, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2705, 2725, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (requiring application of the rule of reason, abrogating a per se 
analysis for vertical price restraint allegations and explicitly overruling past precedent). "
253,3," Rick-Mik relies on Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), and Roberts v. Elaine Powers Figure Salons, 
708 F.2d 1476 (9th Cir. 1983)  [**26] to argue that control evidences economic power by Equilon over its franchisees. Those 
cases relied on the old theory that ties are ""presumptively unlawful,"" Elaine Powers, 708 F.2d at 1479, and that the trademarks 
did not extend to the tied-product, Chicken Delight, 448 F.2d at 48. People don't generally think of Shell when they think of 
credit-card processing; they think of gasoline. But those tests are no longer relevant after Jefferson Parish and Illinois Toolworks,

reason standard applies."" Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1567 (11th Cir. 1991) Courts apply the per se 
rule ""only when history and analysis have shown that in sufficiently similar circumstances the rule of reason unequivocally results 
in a finding of liability."" Consultants & Designers, Inc. v. Butler Serv. Group, Inc., 720 F.2d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir. 1983). In this 
case, Food Movers has not overcome the presumption that the rule-of-reason standard applies."
318,5," Pursuant to the Court's Scheduling Order, the last day for Food Movers to furnish expert witness reports  [*10] was October 12, 
2007. Food Movers did not furnish an expert witness report at that time."
318,6," In support of its request, Food Movers has provided the Court with a Wall Street Journal article which discusses McNeil 
Nutritional's attempts to portray Splenda as a natural or non-artificial sweetener. Food Movers contends that these marketing 
efforts prove that Splenda occupies its own market, independent of other artificial sweeteners. However, this article actually 
works against Food Movers' argument, because it concerns a ""battle between makers of artificial sweeteners,"" including McNeil 
Nutritionals. (See Def.'s Ex. 2.) "
319,7," Food Movers argues that it may ""borrow"" its federal violation to support or sustain its state antitrust claims. (Def.'s Resp. at 14-
15.) Even if such borrowing were possible in theory, in this case the Court has found that no federal violation occurred."
319,8," Diamond Crystal also claims that it never accepted the contract. However, the Court finds that even if there had been 
acceptance, the statute of frauds bars enforcement. "
320,9," Diamond Crystal also argues that an indefinite contract would violate the rule against  [*18] perpetuities. As even a law student 
studying Introduction to Property Law knows, this rule applies only to interests in property. See, e.g., Uniform Statutory Rule 
Against Perpetuities, O.C.G.A. § 44-6-201. It has absolutely no place in a case involving a contract dispute and claims of 
antitrust violation. "
325,1," The petition (this case was removed from Oklahoma state court) purports to state five causes of action. However, two of them, 
addressing declaratory relief and severance of the disputed provisions from the leases, appear to go to form of remedy rather 
than being an independent basis for claim."
325,2," The petition identifies the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas in 
addition to Oklahoma, referencing the residential landlord and tenant statutes and/or consumer protection statutes in those 
states."
325,3," Given that summary judgment briefing is complete, the action should be dismissed as to the unknown ""Does 1 through 10, 
inclusive"" named in the caption because plaintiffs have failed to identify and serve these parties within the time period provided 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m)."
325,4," Indeed, defendant's summary judgment motion is entirely directed to the consequences flowing from its status as a 
management agent -- what it terms the ""proper party"" issue -- which is consistent with the court's previous order permitting an 
initial determination of that issue prior to discovery on broader issues in the case. Order [Doc. # 29], November 28, 2007."
325,5," Defendant's statement of undisputed facts asserts that The Greens at Moore, L.P., the property owner, is not a ""parent, affiliate 
or subsidiary"" of defendant, relying on an affidavit to that effect signed by the president of defendant. Fact 10. To the extent that 
the assertion and affidavit address ""affiliate"" status, they are at least open to dispute and are perhaps flatly false. Both The "
326,," Greens at Moore and defendant are organized under Arkansas law and based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The management 
agreement, Article VIII, indicates James E. Lindsey is the contact person for The Greens at Moore. Paragraph (G) of Article IX of 
the same agreement recites that Mr. Lindsey is the controlling shareholder  [*6] of defendant and that certain persons employed 
by defendant, apparently Mr. Lindsey's family members, cannot be fired without the consent of Mr. Lindsey or his successor 
entity. If ""affiliate"" status was determinative of the issues involved here, the result might well be different. See Management 
Agreement, Exhibit C to plaintiffs' brief."
326,6," Plaintiffs do not suggest, and there is no apparent reason to assume, that they are third party beneficiaries of the management 
agreement to which defendant was a party."
326,7," Some of the Act's provisions explicitly apply to ""parties."" See §§112, 113. Others impose duties on the ""landlord"" or the 
""lessor."""
326,8," The Uniform Commercial Code definition of lessor in the context of personal property leases, relied on by plaintiffs,  [*9] is 
inapplicable."
326,9," This conclusion is consistent with the only authority which appears to have focused on a similar question under an act like the 
ORLTA (which is largely, though not completely, drawn from the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act adopted by the 
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws). In Dikeman v. Carla Properties Ltd., 127 Or.App. 53, 56-57, 871 P.2d 474, 478 (1994), 
the court concluded a management company which made the necessary disclosures did not qualify as a ""landlord"" under the 
Oregon act. "
327,10," The lease agreement is attached to plaintiff's brief as Exhibit A. Paragraph 36 provides: ""36. SERVICE OF

authority to appoint or deny amici which is derived from Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."" Jin v. Ministry 
of State Security, 557 F. Supp. 2d 131, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43209, 2008 WL 2252777, *3 (D.D.C. June 3, 2008). The role of 
an amicus is to assist the court ""in cases of general public interest by making suggestions to the court, by providing 
supplementary assistance to existing counsel, and by insuring a complete and plenary presentation of difficult issues so that the 
court may reach a proper decision."" Newark Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Harrison, N.J., 940 F.2d 792, 808 (3d Cir. 1991). In 
that spirit, and in the absence of any objection, the Motions by these entities as ""friends of the court"" are granted and their briefs "
359,," will be considered; however, the utility of those briefs is minimal given (a) their redundant exposition of arguments duly 
articulated and fully covered by plaintiff; (b) the virtually identical content of each brief; and (c) their singular focus on a collateral 
issue that is distinct from the claims and defenses properly joined herein. Amicus briefs are not properly used to reiterate 
arguments and perspectives  [**3] already before the Court. See Jin, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43209, 2008 WL 2252777, at *3 
(noting that amicus briefs are typically allowed ""when the amicus has unique information or perspective that can help the court 
beyond the help that the lawyers for the parties are able to provide"") (citation omitted)."
359,2," Plaintiff stresses that this is a ""bell weather [sic] case"" that ""has received national attention"" and that ""touches all Rural Water 
Authorities in Alabama."" (Doc. 82, at 1, 5 & n.6.) Such statements are neither relevant nor helpful. It goes without saying that 
every case filed  [**4] in this District Court is important. Moreover, our judicial system's common-law framework implies that 
while rulings at the district court level are not generally binding on non-parties, they may well constitute persuasive authority in 
other disputes in other courts. That is no more or less true here than it would be in any other case pending before the 
undersigned. The Court categorically rejects any suggestion that special treatment or a different approach to the summary 
judgment analysis is warranted in this case because of the importance, novelty or general interest of its subject matter. The 
stakes are high in every lawsuit filed in this District Court, and this case is certainly not unique in that regard."
359,3," In previous rulings in this case, the Court has used the unwieldy acronym MCWSFPA to designate plaintiff. To improve 
readability at no expense to clarity, plaintiff's alternate shorthand of ""MoCo"" will be employed in this Order."
359,4," In its summary judgment briefing, defendant asserts that plaintiff has identified it improperly and that its correct name is ""Board 
of Water and Sewer Commissioners of the City of Mobile, doing business as the Mobile Area Water and Sewer System."" (Doc. 
37, Exh. 1 at 1 n.1; Doc. 85, at 1, n.1.) Be that as it may, there is no dispute that MAWSS is organized as a Board  [**6] of Water 
and Sewer Commissioners under Alabama law; therefore, the summary judgment analysis proceeds in recognition of that 
designation. "
360,5," In that regard, MAWSS's planning and engineering manager, Dwight McGough, testified that if a new sewer customer ""did not 
connect  [**7] to our water that was available, then we would not accept them as a [sewer] customer."" (McGough Dep., at 78.) 
Likewise, MAWSS's director, Malcolm Steeves, testified that if MAWSS customers ""are using our sewer service, they need to 
use our water service…. So if they are and they decide not to for some reason or another, then that would be a problem. They'd 
need to get sewer service some other way."" (Steeves Dep., at 102.) Thus, if an existing MAWSS sewer customer wanted to 
disconnect from MAWSS water service, defendant's policy would be to terminate sewer service to that customer. (Id. at 102-03.)"
360,6," In light of the parties' unanimity on this point, the Court will not belabor it by reciting the considerable record evidence 
marshaled by MoCo to support the existence of that practice, either as a general proposition or in specific instances."
360,7," As a general proposition, there is no question that HN2[
] tying arrangements violate the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Eastman Kodak Co v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 461-62, 112 S.Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (defining tying 
arrangement as an agreement by seller to sell one product only on condition that buyer also purchase a different product, and "
361,," explaining that such an arrangement violates the Sherman Act if the seller has appreciable economic power in the tying product 
market and if the arrangement affects substantial volume of commerce in tied market); Tic-X-Press, Inc. v. Omni Promotions Co. 
of Georgia, 815 F.2d 1407, 1414 (11th Cir. 1987)  [**11] (recognizing that tying arrangements were long ago classified as per se 
anticompetitive practices prohibited by the Sherman Act). Contrary to the labels used in the Amended Complaint, it is evident 
that sewer service is the tying product and water service is the tied product in this case."
361,8," MoCo also requested entry of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against MAWSS. Those motions were 
denied by Order entered on October 29, 2007. See Mobile County Water, Sewer and Fire Protection Authority, Inc. v. Mobile 
Area Water and Sewer System, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79945, 2007 WL 3208587 (S.D. Ala. Oct. 29, 2007). The cross-
motions for summary judgment presented at this time are in substantial part a rerun of the arguments raised and decided in 
connection with the ""likelihood of success on the merits"" prong of MoCo's failed requests for emergency and preliminary 
injunctive relief."
361,9," Significantly, this case is not the only pending litigation between MoCo and MAWSS. Indeed, in August 2005 MoCo sued 
MAWSS in the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama on the following bases: (a) that MAWSS's provision of treated water 
services in MoCo's service area violates the so-called anti-duplication statute  [**12] found at Ala. Code § 11-50-1.1; (b) that 
MAWSS's encroachment in MoCo's service area breaches MAWSS's obligations under a settlement agreement entered into 
between the parties in 1987; (c) that MAWSS is trespassing in MoCo's service area; and (d) claims for declaratory, injunctive 
and monetary relief. The Court understands that this state-court action, including specifically MoCo's claim against MAWSS 
under Ala. Code § 11-50-1.1, remains pending at this time. The legally distinct claims joined in the state-court proceedings are 
not before this Court and will not be decided herein. In August 2007, this Court denied MAWSS's motion to stay this federal 
action pursuant to Colorado River abstention principles (see doc. 17); therefore, parallel litigation has proceeded between the 
same parties in federal and state court, albeit alleging different theories and claims for relief, for more than a year. In declining to 
enter a stay, this Court opined as follows: ""[i]rrespective of how the … § 11-50-1.1 claims are resolved in Mobile County Circuit 
Court, the antitrust causes of action joined in this action will remain outstanding."" Mobile County Water, Sewer and Fire 
Protection Authority, Inc. v. Mobile Area Water and Sewer System, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63591, 2007 WL 2460754, *4 
(S.D. Ala. Aug. 27, 2007).  [**13] The Court also noted that there was no indication ""that a decision on the State Court Action 
claims concerning whether MAWSS is exceeding its contractual and statutory rights by encroaching on [MoCo] territory will 
decide or obviate the need to decide whether MAWSS is engaging in unlawful 'tying' practices under the Sherman Act."" Id."
361,10," The sequencing of these motions is unfortunate. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (doc. 37) was filed and fully 
briefed long before Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (doc. 81) was submitted. Nonetheless, the parties (and plaintiff, in 
particular) utilized this second motion to rebrief, reargue and reiterate the same issues that had already been fully presented in 
connection with Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, as well as to raise previously omitted arguments that could and 
should have been presented in those earlier rounds of briefing. The net effect is that plaintiff has parlayed its cross-motion for 
summary judgment into a second bite at the apple concerning legal issues previously briefed  [**14] in full and taken under 
submission in the context of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. "
362,11," Plaintiff peppers its briefs with inflammatory allegations that MAWSS's conduct is ""hugely wasteful"" and amounts to ""great 
waste,"" that a water pipeline laid by MAWSS constitutes ""an act of extraordinary aggression,"" that defendant is motivated by 
""greed or a thirst for power,"" that customers are victimized by ""the extraordinary greed of MAWSS,"" that MAWSS's conduct is 
""unnecessarily wasteful and destructive,"" and the like. (Doc. 82, at 4, 5, 12; doc. 86, at 6.) Whether defendant's activities are 
wasteful, whether a water pipeline laid by defendant amounts to an attack on plaintiff, whether  [**17] defendant is greedy, and 
the like do not appear relevant to the immunity analysis. Rather, these statements amount to little more than name-calling 
designed to bias the Court against defendant. Such vituperative characterizations concerning collateral matters will be 
disregarded, inasmuch as they do not assist the Court in resolving the cross-motions for summary judgment."
362,12," Indeed, MoCo recognizes the centrality of this issue by stating ""[t]he overarching premise (albeit false) of MAWSS's Motion for 
Summary Judgment is that MAWSS is entitled to 'state action immunity' for its illegal tying."" (Doc. 47, at 1.) That is not to say, 
however, that state action immunity is the only legal basis touted by defendant for Rule 56 relief. To the contrary, defendant 
contends that it is also entitled to judgment as a matter of law because plaintiff has failed to establish the ""economic coercion"" 
element  [**18] of an antitrust tying claim, and that plaintiff's summary judgment motion should be denied because it has failed to 
make a sufficient showing under the ""two separate products"" element. See generally Thompson v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 
934 F.2d 1566, 1574 (11th Cir. 1991) (listing the basic elements of a per se tying claim which a plaintiff must satisfy to avoid 
having its tying claim analyzed under the rule of reason). The Court need not reach these subsidiary questions in order to 
resolve the cross-motions for summary judgment. "
363,13," Although the applicable standard for state action immunity differs depending on whether the defendant is a state, a political 
subdivision, or a private actor, MAWSS plainly fits within the second category. It has been recognized in this Circuit  [**20] that 
HN7[
] the ""political subdivision"" iteration of the state action immunity standard encompasses entities such as hospital and 
transit authorities, state bar organizations, and rural electric cooperatives, based on ""the government-like attributes of the 
defendant entity"" and the presence of indicia demonstrating that ""the nexus between the State and the entity is sufficiently strong 
that there is little real danger that the entity is involved in a private anticompetitive arrangement."" Bankers, 137 F.3d at 1296-97. 
HN8[
] MAWSS's organizing statute provides that it ""shall be deemed to be a public agency or instrumentality exercising public and governmental functions to provide for the public health and welfare."" Ala. Code § 11-50-343(a). As such, any suggestion 
that MAWSS does not qualify as a political subdivision for state action immunity purposes would appear doomed. At any rate, 
MoCo does not challenge MAWSS's status as a political subdivision, nor does it contest the propriety of the ""clearly expressed 
state policy"" yardstick for the immunity defense. (See doc. 47, at 10 (specifically agreeing that MAWSS is a state actor and an 
agency of the City of Mobile, and acknowledging that the ""clearly  [**21] articulated state policy"" standard governs).)"
363,14," That principle is not without limits, however. In accordance with Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, Colo., 455 
U.S. 40, 54-56, 102 S.Ct. 835, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982), ""a general grant of authority to govern local affairs is insufficient to 
constitute a clear articulation of state policy because the State's position is neutral with respect to the city's conduct."" Auton v. 
Dade City, Florida, 783 F.2d 1009, 1010 (11th Cir. 1986). "
364,15," The breadth of this grant of authority is reinforced by another subsection of the same statute, which authorizes boards ""[t]o do 
all acts and things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly granted in this article."" Ala. Code § 11-50-
343(a)(13)."
364,16," Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are without merit. For example, MoCo asserts that the statutory authorization to combine 
water and sewer systems is limited to ""operation and financing"" matters,  [**26] which excludes combining the systems for 
purposes of the all-or-nothing policy at issue here. (Doc. 47, at 15.) The Court cannot agree. ""Operation"" is a broad term. The 
legislative framework clearly allows MAWSS to combine the operations of its water and sewer systems and to enact any rules 
and regulations that are necessary or desirable for efficient operations of those systems. The bundled sale of water and sewer 
services to its customers is a MAWSS policy within the heartland of that broad statutory authorization. Plaintiff also protests that 
the cited Alabama code sections are silent as to whether MAWSS may enact all-or-nothing arrangements and do not specifically 
endorse the all-or-nothing policy. Once again, this argument presupposes a much greater degree of legislative precision than the 
legal standard contemplates. "
365,17," In its Reply Brief (doc. 86), the last of several briefs filed by MoCo on the issue of state action immunity, plaintiff argues for the 
first time that state action immunity is unavailable here because the antitrust claims brought against a political subdivision are 
being brought by a political subdivision, not a private individual. Plaintiff fails to identify any authority supporting the proposition 
that the availability of state action immunity depends on the identity of the entity bringing the antitrust claims. Nor is there any 
basis in logic or common 'sense why state action immunity should turn on the status of the plaintiff, such that municipalities who 
would enjoy such immunity if private actors sue them in antitrust would be stripped of such immunity if another municipality is the 
plaintiff. Accordingly, even if this argument were properly raised in MoCo's reply brief at the conclusion  [**31] of multiple rounds 
of briefing, the Court declines plaintiff's invitation to devise a novel exception to the well-established state action immunity 
doctrine. If, as plaintiff suggests, there is a paucity of authority awarding state action immunity when a regulated entity is being 
sued by another regulated entity under antitrust law, it does not follow that there is an analytical impediment to application of 
state action immunity in those circumstances. Rather, a far more likely explanation for the dearth of such authority is that 
municipalities rarely sue each other under the Sherman Act. Government-on-government antitrust lawsuits are aberrational. 
Besides, plaintiff's contention that all of the relevant caselaw concerning this immunity involves private actors suing regulated 
actors is simply false. See, e.g., Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (city entitled to state action 
immunity from antitrust liability where plaintiffs were four Wisconsin townships); Falls Chase, 788 F.2d at 711-714 (city entitled to 
state action immunity from antitrust liability where plaintiff was a local unit of special government created by state law to perform 
prescribed specialized functions within limited boundaries).  [**32] Plaintiff's insistence that the Wisconsin townships in Town of 
Hallie and the local unit of special government in Falls Chase are ""private actors"" is misleading and inaccurate. And MoCo's "
366,," desperate argument that to cloak MAWSS with immunity here would somehow create a ""pecking order"" among Alabama 
regulated utilities is meritless. It does not create a pecking order to recognize that the Alabama legislature intended 
anticompetitive effects in the market for service of water and sewer supplies. It does not create a pecking order for the Court to 
hold that MoCo has no remedy in antitrust law, particularly where it is pursuing potentially viable remedies under state law in 
state court at this time. Ironically, if anyone is requesting a pecking order here, it is MoCo, with its insistence that federal 
antitrust law should operate to forbid MAWSS from undertaking any water service activities in MoCo's territory, thereby 
affording MoCo preeminence and monopoly power in its service area."
366,18," Also instructive is Kern-Tulare Water Dist. v. City of Bakersfield, 828 F.2d 514 (9th Cir. 1987), wherein Sherman Act claims 
were brought against a California municipality for conditioning its sale of water to a water district on that water district not re-
selling the water. Nothing in the California statutes expressly conferred authority on the municipality to impose a no-resale 
condition on water sales; however, the Ninth Circuit concluded that state action immunity  [**34] attached nonetheless because 
""[t]he restriction of transfer is foreseeable within the authority of the city to contract for, acquire and hold water rights, to furnish 
itself and its inhabitants with water, and to sell, lease, exchange, or transfer surplus water."" Id. at 519-20. Surely, if a 
municipality's attachment of ""no-resale"" conditions on water transfers was an anticompetitive effect that was reasonably 
foreseeable from the general grant of authority to the municipality to buy and sell water, then MAWSS's requirement that its 
sewer customers also buy water from it was an anticompetitive effect that was authorized and reasonably foreseeable from the 
general grant of authority to MAWSS to combine its water and sewer systems operationally and to take any actions desired or 
convenient in furtherance of that combined system. See also Avalon Carriage, 417 F. Supp.2d at 1289 (broad legislative 
enactment authorizing city to regulate carriages and wagons gave rise to state action immunity because it had foreseeable 
anticompetitive effects, where city capped number of horse-drawn carriage permits and awarded almost all such permits to 
plaintiff's competitor, even though competitor was  [**35] not using most of those permits)."
366,19," In light of this determination, it is unnecessary to examine defendant's alternative argument for summary judgment that, even if 
immunity does not attach, plaintiff's claims should still be dismissed for want of evidence of actual coercion. (See doc. 37, at 7-
8.) In any event, plaintiff has come forward with substantial record evidence of coercion, so it appears unlikely that Rule 56 relief 
would be appropriate for defendant based on this argument, were the Court to reach it. "
367,20," Before reaching the merits of MoCo's argument, two other points bear mention, at least in passing. First, MoCo's reliance on § 
11-50-1.1 effectively blurs or, more accurately, obliterates the line separating its federal lawsuit from its state lawsuit. If MoCo 
intended for its Sherman Act claims in this action to collapse into the § 11-50-1.1 cause of action it began pursuing against 
MAWSS in state court two years before it filed its Complaint in federal court, then it is difficult to conceive of why MoCo would 
choose to prosecute a second, redundant lawsuit in this forum. After all, the declaratory and injunctive relief sought here would 
presumably be equally available in the state-court proceedings. (See doc. 82, at 6 (conceding that MoCo seeks nothing 
 [**39] other than an injunction in this case).) And if both the federal and the state lawsuits turn on the construction of § 11-50-
1.1, then MoCo can achieve nothing in this action other than increased expense and inconvenience for the parties, as well as 
duplicative commitment of judicial resources in two different forums. Second, if as MoCo now contends its Sherman Act claims 
rest on the § 11-50-1.1 issue, then it is troubling that this factor was not brought to the Court's attention by MoCo during the 
briefing of MAWSS's Motion to Stay (doc. 13), which was predicated on the existence of parallel state-court proceedings. Upon 
applying the Colorado River factors, this Court declined to abstain pending the outcome of the state-court action, based in no 
small part on the Court's assessment that the legal issues in the two cases were distinct and that the state-court rulings would 
not affect the antitrust claims in this action. (See doc. 17, at 7-8.) Had the Court been aware at that time that MoCo intended to 
bootstrap its Sherman Act claims on the proposition that MAWSS was in violation of § 11-50-1.1, when a separate § 11-50-1.1 
claim was already pending before the Mobile County Circuit Court,  [**40] the Colorado River analysis would have proceeded far 
differently. The net result of MoCo's omission of its intentions in this regard in briefing the Colorado River analysis was that this 
Court in ruling on the Motion to Stay was incorrectly led to believe that the issues pending in the two cases were distinct and that 
this Court was being asked to decide only issues of federal law, not unsettled, thorny questions of Alabama statutory 
interpretation that were already pending before a state tribunal. If, in fact, the § 11-50-1.1 issue were relevant to the antitrust 
claims presented here (the Court finds herein that it is not), then the Court would not embark on a quest to resolve unsettled 
questions of Alabama statutory interpretation that are pending in a state-court action involving these very parties without first 
taking a long look at the propriety of abstention, whether on motion by defendant or sua sponte, given the obvious potential for 
interference with the state-court proceedings and inconsistent rulings arising from the significant overlap of legal issues involved. "
368,21," It is difficult to imagine how the mere duplication of services by competing service providers in the same geographic area -- 
which is the very definition of competition in the marketplace -- could possibly amount to a restraint of trade or other 
anticompetitive conduct that might violate the Sherman Act. Even if it could, the point remains that MoCo has not fashioned its 
Sherman Act claims on this theory, and cannot rely on sleight of hand in a summary judgment brief to rewrite those claims now."
368,22," To be clear, the Court makes no findings and expresses no opinions as to whether MAWSS's conduct is violative of § 11-50-
1.1. That determination hinges on issues of Alabama statutory interpretation as well as construction of the Alabama 
 [**44] Supreme Court's limited and potentially ambiguous guidance in City of Wetumpka v. Central Elmore Water Authority, 703 
So.2d 907 (Ala. 1997). Inasmuch as these questions have not been properly joined in this lawsuit, whereas they are pending 
before the Circuit Court of Mobile County in parallel state-court litigation, this Court will not wade into those murky waters 
unnecessarily. See generally Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 362 F.3d 739, 755 (11th Cir. 2004) (recognizing that 
""questions of state law … should presumptively be left to state tribunals""); Baggett v. First Nat'l Bank of Gainesville, 117 F.3d 
1342, 1353 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing general proposition that ""[s]tate courts, not federal courts, should be the final arbiters of state 
law"")."
368,23," Plaintiff admits as much, stating that MoCo ""does not dispute any conduct pursuant to [MAWSS's organizing statutes] within 
the city limits of Mobile."" (Doc. 47, at 19.)"
368,24," To take the reasoning one step further, suppose the shoe were on the other foot and MoCo were attempting to reach into 
MAWSS's service territory to provide competing water services. Under MoCo's own reasoning, MAWSS would face no Sherman "
369,," Act liability for its tying arrangements in that event because MoCo would be infringing on MAWSS's service territory (such that 
MAWSS would not  [**46] be violating § 11-50-1.1, even though its anticompetitive behavior would be precisely the same as it is 
in the facts of this case), rather than the converse. Likewise, under MoCo's theory, MoCo would apparently be protected by 
immunity from Sherman Act liability for tying arrangements that it performed anywhere because Ala. Code § 11-50-1.1 does not 
apply to it. In short, to adopt MoCo's reasoning would be to draw false, unprincipled distinctions and yield bizarre, incongruent 
results in which antitrust liability would be predicated on mere happenstance and caprice, rather than being rooted in any 
systematic, consistent application of federal and state statutory authority. The Court declines to embrace such a blatantly result-
driven rationale."
369,25," Similarly, plaintiff argues elsewhere that § 11-50-1.1 ""prohibits competition initiated by a municipal Water Board (MAWSS) 
against a rural Water Authority (Mobile County Water Authority) without the permission of the rural Water Authority."" (Doc. 47, at 
6-7.) Plaintiff also states that ""the legislative intent is to protect [MoCo] from competition of any sort."" (Id. at 18.)"
369,26," Another way to make the point is as follows: MoCo's antitrust causes of action in this lawsuit are rooted  [**49] in the premise 
that MAWSS is competing with it unfairly. HN17[
] Unfair competition is, at some level, the essence of an antitrust violation. 
Yet, MoCo's own position is that the Alabama legislature intended to forbid competition between MAWSS and MoCo altogether. 
If the legislature intended there to be no competition between MAWSS and MoCo, and if an anticompetitive legislative scheme 
lies at the core of the state action immunity defense, then the legislature's clear anticompetitive framework for municipal water 
and sewer supplies should immunize MAWSS from liability in antitrust law for anticompetitive acts with respect to MoCo. Once 
again, it is clear that MoCo is attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole by seeking to hold MAWSS liable in antitrust law 
for its conduct in this case. The theory simply does not fit the facts. MoCo may or may not have viable claims for relief under § 
11-50-1.1, for breach of contract, and the like, but those issues are joined in the parallel state-court proceedings and are not 
properly before this Court. "
370,27," Notably, the parties have not argued otherwise, and plaintiff has never suggested that its § 6-5-60 cause of action can survive 
summary judgment if its federal antitrust claims do not. To the contrary, plaintiff concedes that ""Alabama state antitrust analysis 
mimics the Federal antitrust analysis."" (Doc. 82, at 2 n.3.) There being no discernable distinction between the federal and state 
antitrust claims, and the parties having identified none, the dismissal of the Sherman Act claims will likewise be fatal to plaintiff's 
§ 6-5-60  [**52] cause of action. "
372,1, Plaintiffs did not renew their allegations against CTTC director Caroline Beteta. 
376,2," In reaching this conclusion, the Court does not rely on the CTTC assessment ballot which characterized the assessment as a 
""a percentage of Revenue to be collected by each passenger car rental company."" (FAC P 40, Ex. E.) The ""collected by"" 
language is consistent with the statutory description of the commission's assessment and thus does not indicate any intent to 
pass on fees. See Cal. Civil Code § 1936.01(a)(3). "
378,3," Though the parties dispute whether the CTTC complied with the Bagley-Keene Act requirements, there is no dispute that the 
legislature requires the CTTC to comply with it. See Cal. Gov't Code § 13995.40(q)."
378,4," This authorization was part of the original CTMA and not added in connection with AB 2592. See 1995 Cal. Legis. Serv. c. 871 
§ 5 (creating original corresponding CTMA provision  [*25] at Cal. Gov't Code § 15372.105(f)); 2003 Cal. Legis. Serv. c. 229 §§ 
1.5 (recodifying as Cal. Gov't Code § 13995.65(f)). "
380,5," The Court is unaware of any case law directly addressing the immunity provision of 13995.90 and concludes that Cel-Tech 
provides the best available guidance on whether section 13995.90 should provide any protection from the claims presented 
here. "
393,1, All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise noted.
393,2," Plaintiffs are James Clayworth, R.Ph., an individual, doing business as Clayworth Pharmacy and Clayworth Healthcare; Marin

Merck & Co., Inc.; Bristol-Myers-Squibb Company; Wyeth; Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems Inc., which apparently 
does not manufacture, market, or distribute pharmaceutical products; and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of 
America, a United States-based nonprofit trade association. "
395,4," In the separate statement of undisputed facts in support of their cross-motion, defendants stated as fact No. 7, “Plaintiffs have 
expressly waived any claims for damages not based on the alleged overcharge, including lost sales  [***11] and diminished 
business damages.” Plaintiffs responded, “Undisputed as written, though immaterial and irrelevant. Plaintiffs have waived their 
right to collect money damages on lost profits. Plaintiffs' damages are the full extent of the overcharge paid by [p]laintiffs—no 
more or less. However, [p]laintiffs have never stated they were not ‘damaged in fact’ by [d]efendants' overcharge, which put 
them at a competitive disadvantages vis-à-vis other pharmacies; they simply choose not to collect monies owed them for lost 
profits.”"
395,5," Plaintiffs also sought summary adjudication on other affirmative defenses. These were not ruled on below, and are not 
 [***12] at issue here."
395,6," This motion assumed arguendo that defendants did in fact engage in price fixing. At the same time, defendants filed a motion 
for summary judgment on the merits of plaintiffs' claims, which motion was pending at the time the motions at issue here were 
decided."
395,7," Plaintiffs also filed a request for judicial notice in this court, asking us to take notice of two items from the litigation in the United 
States District Court in In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation (N.D.Cal., May 27, 2008, No. M-07-1827-SI) 2008 
U.S.Dist. Lexis 54724): (1) the amicus brief of the State of California filed by the Attorney General, and (2) request for judicial 
notice filed by the Attorney General. We granted the request at oral argument. "
397,8," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part, ?any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor … and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained … .” 
(15 U.S.C. § 15.) "
399,9," On behalf of the State of California, the Attorney General filed an amicus curiae brief in Illinois Brick,  [***26] arguing in support 
of standing for indirect purchasers. The brief argued first that the defendants were improperly attempting to assert a pass-on 
defense that had already been rejected in Hanover Shoe. Alternatively, it argued that the facts of the case “would fall within the 
exception recognized in Hanover Shoe in any case.”"
399,10," In the 40 years since Hanover Shoe, the Legislature has amended the Cartwright Act six times: Statutes. 1969, chapter 1234, 
page 2395; Statutes 1972 chapter 1140, page 2207; Statutes 1977 chahpter 540, page 1741; Statutes 1978 chapter 536, page 
1693; Statutes 1983 chapter 1069, page 3772; and Statutes 1987 chapter 865, page 2742."
399,11," One Supreme Court case, Union Carbide Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 15 [201 Cal. Rptr. 580, 679 P.2d 14] 
(Union Carbide), mentions Hanover Shoe, but only in the dissenting opinion (id. at p. 26 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.)). We 
ourselves discussed Hanover Shoe in Crown Oil Corp. v. Superior Court (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 604, 608–609 [223 Cal. Rptr. 
164], where the issue was whether the 1978 amendment to the Cartwright Act was preempted by federal law. "
400,12," While these cases say what they say, in both cases the Court of Appeal went on to decertify classes of antitrust plaintiffs on 
the grounds that their injuries could not be presumed on a classwide basis because some “members of the proposed class used 
loss mitigation techniques, such as … passing on any inflated prices in subsequent resales.” (J. P. Morgan & Co., Inc. v. 
Superior Court, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 218; Global Minerals & Metals Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 
857.) As the court put it, such evidence “may support a pass-on defense,” further noting that the case was not one “in which 
classwide proof of illegality and impact [i.e., injury] could readily be proved . …” (J. P. Morgan, at p. 218; Global Minerals, at p. 
857.) "
405,13," This same point is in the general definition of damages, in Civil Code section 3281, which provides as follows: “Every person 
who suffers detriment from the unlawful  [***49] act or omission of another, may recover from the person in fault a compensation 
therefor in money, which is called damages.” And Civil Code section 3282 in turn defines “detriment” to mean “a loss or harm 
suffered in person or property.” As defendants correctly explain, “Overcharges that have already been fully recovered—the only 
damages alleged in this case—clearly cause no detriment and cannot be recovered again through the award of damages.”"
405,14," “ ‘ “Parens patriae,” literally “parent of the country,” refers traditionally to [the] role of [the] state as sovereign and guardian of 
persons under legal disability [¶] … [¶] State attorney generals [sic] have parens patriae authority to bring actions on behalf of 
state residents for anti-trust offenses and to recover on their behalf.’ ” (Pacific Gas & Electric, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 1148, fn. 6, 
quoting Black's Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1114, col. 1.) "
406,15," In Liquid Asphalt, the Ninth Circuit endorsed the use of the offensive pass-on theory, setting forth mechanisms available to 
deal with the problem of multiple liability should such a situation arise. (Liquid Asphalt, supra, 487 F.2d at pp. 197, 201.)"
406,16," The California parens patriae provision permits the Attorney General or the district attorney of any county to bring a civil action 
in the name of the people of the State of California or the residents of the county, respectively, for treble damages arising from 
violations of the Cartwright Act. (§ 16760, subds. (a), (g).) "
408,17," The cited paragraph includes this quotation, with the italics as supplied by plaintiffs: “ ‘Moreover, the fact of purchasers 
intermediate between plaintiffs and direct purchasers in the chain of distribution, even if assumed, would not establish a 
substantial risk of multiple liability. There is no showing of any actual assertion of a Cartwright Act claim on behalf of any such 
intermediate purchaser. We turn again to the views expressed by the Illinois Brick dissenting opinion that seem to have met with 
the California Legislature's approval when it amended section 16750, subdivision (a), in 1978 … .’ ” (See Union Carbide, supra, 
36 Cal.3d at pp. 23–24.) "
412,18," Plaintiffs' UCL claim also prays for injunctive relief, though their brief does not address the point. The same rationale that 
applies to the restitution analysis would preclude any right to any action for injunction, which can be brought only by prosecutors 
or by a person “who has suffered injury in fact  [***78] and has lost money or property.” (§ 17204.) "
417,*," The FDA maintains in its Orange Book a list of the patents that, according to the manufacturer, protect each branded drug."
417,*," The FDA may not approve an application that does not account for a claimed patent, see 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii), (j)(4)(J), 
or that ""contains an untrue statement of material fact,"" § 355(j)(4)(K)."
417,*," HN4[
] The statute provides that the stay terminates when ""the court"" determines the patent at issue is invalid or would not be infringed. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). The FDA at that time took the position that the stay would expire only upon the resolution "
418,," of any appeal. After TorPharm v. Shalala, No. Civ.A. 97-1925, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21983. 1997 WL 33472411 (D.D.C. Sept. 
15, 1997), and Mylan Pharmaceuticals v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000), were decided, however, the FDA adopted 
the district court's view that the judgment of a district  [***5] court in favor of the generic applicant terminates the stay. FDA, 
Guidance for Industry (Mar. 2000), available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/3659fnl.pdf. The FDA amended 21 C.F.R. § 
314.107 accordingly, 65 Fed. Reg. 43,233 (July 13, 2000), but did not apply the rule to ANDAs, such as Andrx's, then pending, 
id. at 43,234-35."
418,*, Plaintiffs make no argument specific to the law of any state. 
420,*," In principle, the plaintiffs could establish antitrust injury by showing that, but for Biovail's misuse of the '463 patent, they could 
have  [***13] purchased generic Diltiazem HCl from Andrx at any time during the pendency of the stay caused by the '463 
patent. The plaintiffs, however, have not argued that Andrx would have obtained approval from the FDA and been ready to 
market the drug at any time after February 2001 but before the expiration of the statutory stay -- a wise strategy in view of the 
problems Andrx encountered trying to manufacture Taztia during that period. Therefore, it is crucial to the plaintiffs' case, as 
counsel acknowledged at oral argument, that they make the showing stated in the text."
420,**," Not all the plaintiffs invoked all the evidence upon which they all now rely; because we find the totality of competent evidence 
insufficient to defeat the defendants' motion for summary judgment, however, we need not concern ourselves with the effort of 
certain of the plaintiffs to rely on appeal upon evidence they did not adduce before the district court. "
421,*," In addition to the evidence described in the text, the plaintiffs refer in their brief to the FDA's ""conclu[sion] in writing … that 
[Andrx's] generic drug would be approved, but for the … infringement suit."" No such conclusion is to be found in the record of 
this case, however, and the plaintiffs do not provide the statement itself but instead quote the opinion in Andrx Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 175 F. Supp. 2d at 1366. We disregard that purported ""evidence""; if the underlying evidence exists and is in the record of 
the cited case, then the plaintiffs, who have access to that record,  [***17] should have produced it. Cf. Cmty. Hosps. of Cent. 
Cal. v. NLRB, 357 U.S. App. D.C. 361, 335 F.3d 1079, 1086-87 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (HN8[
] presumption may arise from failure to 
produce evidence to which party has access) (citing United States v. Young, 150 U.S. App. D.C. 98, 463 F.2d 934, 939 (D.C. 
Cir. 1972))."
421,*," The plaintiffs assert in a footnote in their reply brief that the various amendments were minor matters (relating to product 
labeling) that would not have prevented final approval in February 2001, but that assertion is as conclusory as it is untimely. See 
United States v. Whren, 324 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 111 F.3d 956, 958 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (HN9[
] ""absent extraordinary 
circumstances (not present here) we do not entertain an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief or for that matter, 
 [***19] in a footnote"" (citations omitted)). "
422,*," The plaintiffs do not allege the defendants engaged in any misconduct after April 2002, when Biovail dropped its claim that the 
'463 patent protected Tiazac. "
423,*," Rule 12(b)(6) requires us to assume the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint but not to disregard our own holding that the 
plaintiffs cannot show Andrx would have competed with Biovail but for the latter company's misconduct. Cf. 5B WRIGHT, 
MILLER & KANE, supra, § 1357 (HN16[
] ""Numerous cases … have allowed consideration of matters incorporated by "
424,," reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public record, orders, items appearing in the record 
of the case, and exhibits attached to the complaint whose authenticity is unquestioned; these items may be considered by the 
district judge without converting the motion into one for summary judgment"")."
424,*," In any event, the plaintiffs have not explained why they would need additional discovery: It is undisputed that the LWD plaintiffs 
have had access to the full record of the litigation in Florida; Andrx obviously would have introduced in that case any document 
responsive to this request in its attempt to have the FDA remove the '463 patent from the Orange Book. "
426,1, All further section references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified.
426,2," We deny defendant's request for judicial notice of facts relating to the presence and nature of certain businesses at the 
intersection of Hazel and Madison Avenues in Sacramento County. Such facts are not of such common knowledge within the "
427,," territorial jurisdiction of the court that they cannot  [*2] reasonably be the subject of dispute. (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (g), (h).) 
Although defendant proffered two photographs and a MapQuest printout, the photographs fail to identify the location of the 
images and the MapQuest printout fails to reflect the presence and/or location of any buildings. Thus, these materials do not 
provide this court with sufficient information to accurately determine the truth of the requested facts. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. 
(h); see Sierra Club v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 149, 158.) We also deny defendant's request for sanctions against plaintiffs for having filed a frivolous appeal. An appeal is frivolous if ""'any 
reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.' [Citations]."" (Johnson v. Lewis (2004) 
120 Cal.App.4th 443, 457.) If the appellant presents issues that are arguably correct even if extremely unlikely to win, sanctions 
will not result. (In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650.) Defendant's claim that the appeal is completely without 
merit is based in large part on facts outside the pleadings and we have denied their request for judicial notice of those facts. 
 [*3] Given the complexity of the issues raised by the operative complaint, we cannot say the appeal is ""totally and completely 
without merit."""
427,3," When reviewing a judgment based on an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, we treat all properly pled facts 
as true. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) "
428,4," In plaintiffs' view, these four grounds are that (1) defendant and Panattoni conspired to tie the sale of the J Street Property to 
the purchase of the Hazel Property, which was subject to the restrictive covenant in violation of the Cartwright Act (§ 16720) and, 
(2) that same conspiracy was a combination in restraint  [*9] of trade (§ 16720), (3) defendant's actions were injurious to 
competition, and (4) defendant's tortious interference with plaintiffs' economic relationship with Panattoni and defendant's pattern "
429,," and practice of tortiously interfering with the economic and contractual relationships of third parties constituted unfair 
competition."
429,5," By contrast, the Unfair Practices Act (UFA) (§ 17000) ""prohibits specific 'practices which the legislature has determined 
constitute unfair trade practices,'"" (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 179, quoting Wholesale T. Dealers v. National etc. Co. 
(1938) 11 Cal.2d 634, 643), including such practices as locality discrimination, below-cost sales, loss leaders, and boycotts. (§§ 
17040, 17043, 17044, 17046.)"
429,6," Section 16720 provides in pertinent part that ""[a] trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of 
the following purposes: [P] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. . . . [P] (c) To prevent competition in 
manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity."" Any such trust is 
""unlawful, against public policy and void"" (§ 16726) and any person injured in his or her business or property by reason of 
anything declared unlawful under the act may bring a civil action to recover treble  [*13] damages and for injunctive relief. (§ 
16750, subd. (a).) Because the Cartwright Act is patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and the two acts share common 
roots, federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable when construing the Cartwright Act. (Marin County Bd. of 
Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16 Cal.3d 920, 925.) "
430,7," Section 16727 prohibits certain types of tying arrangements. It provides: ""It shall be unlawful for any person to lease or make a 
sale or contract for the sale of goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities for use within the State, or to fix a price 
charged therefore, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or 
purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities, or services of a 
competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, 
agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of trade or 
commerce in any section of the State."" Because section 16727 is inapplicable to agreements  [*14] for the sale of land (Suburban Motor Homes, Inc. v. AMFAC 
Communities, Inc. (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 532, 549 (Suburban)), it does not apply to the tying arrangement alleged in this case. "
432,8," Monopolies ""unduly diminish competition and . . . enhance prices"" (Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra, 221 U.S. at p. 57 
[55 L.Ed. at p. 644]) and are therefore defined as the ""'power to control prices or exclude competition.'"" (Fisher v. City of 
Berkeley (1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 678, quoting United States v. Du Pont Co. (1956) 351 U.S. 377, 391 & fn. 18 [100 L.Ed. 1264, 
1278-1279].) "
455,1," For example, a merger between two close competitors can sometimes raise antitrust concerns due to unilateral effects in highly 
differentiated markets. See generally Horizontal Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. 41,552, 41,560-61, § 2.2 (1992). In such a 
situation,  [***16] it might not be necessary to understand the market definition to conclude a preliminary injunction should issue. 
The FTC alludes to this theory on appeal, but to the district court it argued simply that the merger would result in a highly 
concentrated PNOS market. "
456,2," Dr. Scheffman did not actually calculate the amount of this loss. He simply predicted that because many Whole Foods and Wild 
Oats customers also shop at conventional supermarkets, the loss would at any rate be too large. "
466,1," In light of changes made by Judge Brown and Judge Tatel to their opinions in response to the petition for rehearing -- most 
notably, the fact that Judge Tatel no longer joins Judge Brown's opinion, meaning there is no majority opinion for the Court -- this 
dissent contains changes throughout, including a new Part III, from the dissenting opinion released on July 29, 2008. "
468,2," Judge Tatel's opinion disparages the evidence about Whole Foods's prices, calling it ""all-but-meaningless"" and implicitly 
suggesting that Whole Foods manipulated its prices just for the expert study. Tatel Op. at 11. But Judge Tatel offers no evidence 
for that suggestion. "
469,3," A showing that the merged entity would possess  [***72] market concentration in a defined product market is necessary but not 
suficient to establish an antitrust violation. See United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222, 908 F.2d 981, 985 
(D.C. Cir. 1990) (listing factors that might militate against finding an antitrust violation, even assuming market concentration 
exists). I need not address the other necessary components of the FTC's case, however, because the FTC has not satisfied the 
threshold requirement of showing that the merged entity would have such market concentration. "
470,4," According to Judge Tatel's opinion, the FTC's expert purported to say that Whole Foods could impose a five percent or greater 
price increase because of the number of Wild Oats customers who would switch to Whole Foods rather than conventional 
supermarkets. Tatel Op. at 6 (citing Rebuttal Expert Report of Kevin M. Murphy P 32 (July 13, 2007)). But that ambiguous 
statement constituted  [***76] a single, unexplained sentence in the middle of a lengthy report. Moreover, the expert apparently 
based his conclusion entirely on the so-called ""Project Goldmine"" analysis of diversion ratios associated with store closures -- 
that is, of the number of Wild Oats customers who would switch to Whole Foods in the event that a Wild Oats store closes and 
Whole Foods prices remain constant. As the expert himself appeared to acknowledge, see Murphy Report P 32 (noting that 
""marginal and average diversion ratios could be different""), the data do not necessarily shed any light on how many customers 
would continue to shop at a merged Wild Oats-and-Whole Foods entity in the event that the entity uniformly increased prices. All 
of this no doubt explains why the FTC never even mentioned this aspect of its expert's report in the argument section of its 
opening brief. "
472,5," As two antitrust commentators perceptively stated: ""The basic problem with the FTC's position in Whole Foods was that it 
lacked the pricing evidence it had in Staples, which showed that customers did not go elsewhere if the office superstores 
increased their prices. Whole Foods is an attempt by the FTC to persuade a court that if you take a CEO's statements about a 
merger and stir it in with evidence showing the existence of several 'practical indicia' from Brown Shoe, the resulting mixture 
should trump objective evidence about how customers would react in the event of a price increase."" Carlton Varner & Heather 
Cooper, Product Markets in Merger Cases: The Whole Foods Decision (Oct. 2007), www.antitrustsource.com."
472,6," The gloss on § 53(b) appears to have arisen originally in other circuits around the middle of the 20th century in connection with 
a more general view that a lighter ""likelihood of success"" standard is appropriate whenever the balance of equities weighs 
strongly in favor of issuing an injunction. Compare FTC v. Beatrice Foods Co., 190 U.S. App. D.C. 328, 587 F.2d 1225, 1229 
(D.C. Cir. 1978) (Appendix to Statement of MacKinnon & Robb, JJ.) (citing Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 
738, 740 (2d Cir. 1953) (which noted in the FTC merger context that ""if the other elements are present (i.e., the balance of 
hardships tips decidedly toward plaintiff), it will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so 
serious . . . ."")), with Omar v. Harvey, 416 F. Supp. 2d 19, 28 (D.D.C. 2006) (citing Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm'n v. 
Holiday Tours, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 220, 559 F.2d 841, 842-44 & n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (which noted outside the  [***87] FTC 
merger context that courts may generally apply the relatively lax ""serious questions"" approach only ""when confronted with a case "
473,," in which the other three [preliminary injunction] factors strongly favor interim relief"")). But as explained below in footnote 7, 
Congress in 1973 codified a preliminary injunction standard for FTC merger cases that specifically directs courts to consider the 
Commission's ""likelihood of ultimate success."" 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). And as explained in the text, the Supreme Court recently 
repudiated the ""serious questions"" approach to preliminary injunctions in general by requiring a likelihood of success showing in 
all cases, regardless of whether the balance of equities weighs in favor of the injunction. See Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 128 
S. Ct. 2207, 2219, 171 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2008)."
473,7," In justifying his adoption of the ""serious questions"" test for likelihood of success, Judge Tatel highlights the ""unique 'public 
interest' standard  [***88] in 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). "" Tatel Op. at 3 (citing FTC v. Exxon Corp., 205 U.S. App. D.C. 208, 636 F.2d 
1336, 1343 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); see also id. at 3. But the statute explicitly preserves the traditional likelihood of success 
requirement. See § 53(b) (""Commission's likelihood of ultimate success""). What makes § 53's standard for preliminary 
injunctions ""unique,"" as we have explained, is that the FTC need not show irreparable harm and, secondarily, that private 
equities are subordinated to public equities. See FTC v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 214 U.S. App. D.C. 254, 665 F.2d 1072, 1081-83 
(D.C. Cir. 1981) (""The case law Congress codified removes irreparable damage as an essential element of the preliminary 
injunction proponent's case and permits the judge to presume from a likelihood of success showing that the public interest will be 
served by interim relief.""); see also Heinz, 246 F.3d at 727 n.25; Exxon Corp., 636 F.2d at 1343. Far from reading the ""likelihood 
of ultimate success"" language out of the statute, we have recognized that the statutory phrase ""weighing the equities and 
considering the likelihood of ultimate success"" was specifically added by the Conference Committee and that this ""deliberate 
addition"" should not ""be brushed aside  [***89] as essentially repetitive or meaningless."" Weyerhaeuser, 665 F.2d at 1081. "
474,8," The precedential effect of today's splintered decision is muddied somewhat by the fact that Judge Brown and Judge Tatel have 
issued individual opinions concurring in the judgment. That said, it is of course well-settled that the mere fact that there is no 
majority opinion does not mean that the decision constitutes no precedent  [***92] for future cases. This happens quite 
frequently with splintered Supreme Court decisions where there is no majority opinion. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly 
explained, in the vast majority of cases without a majority opinion there is still a binding holding of the Court -- even if it can 
occasionally be difficult to determine. This is known as the Marks principle. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S. 
Ct. 990, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1977); King v. Palmer, 292 U.S. App. D.C. 362, 950 F.2d 771, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (en banc) (""implicit 
agreement"" between judges can produce a ""controlling"" principle of law); see generally Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 947 F.2d 682, 691-97 (3d Cir. 1991). Like the Supreme Court, this Court has routinely recognized that a 
decision without a majority opinion usually still constitutes a binding precedent. See, e.g., In re Navy Chaplaincy, 534 F.3d 756, 
759 n.2, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 29 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (construing Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, 551 U.S. 587, 127 S. 
Ct. 2553, 168 L. Ed. 2d 424 (2007)); Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 278 U.S. App. D.C. 24, 876 F.2d 902, 910 
(D.C. Cir. 1989) (""a lower federal court must do its level best to extract the holding that commanded a majority in each case to 
arrive at the governing principles  [***93] and limitations""), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 
547, 110 S. Ct. 2997, 111 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1990); Martin v. Malhoyt, 265 U.S. App. D.C. 89, 830 F.2d 237, 247 n.28 (D.C. Cir. 
1987) (citing Marks and noting that Justice Black's concurrence in Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S. Ct. 1335, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1434 
(1959), ""provides the 'narrowest grounds' for the Court's disposition of the case and thus constitutes the Court's holding""). Only 
in very rare cases do the opinions making up a majority of a court contain no common principles or common ground on which to 
derive any precedential holding of the court. See Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 743-46, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 
745 (1994) (construing Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U.S. 222, 100 S. Ct. 1585, 64 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1980)); King, 950 F.2d at 782-85. It is unclear whether district courts and future courts of appeals will construe this case as one of those rare situations that falls 
entirely outside the Marks rule. At a minimum, this confused decision will invite years of uncertainty and litigation over what the 
holding of this case is -- a separate but important problem with the Court's approach. "

485,1," For example, a merger between two close competitors can sometimes raise antitrust concerns due to unilateral effects in highly 
differentiated markets. See generally Horizontal Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. 41,552, 41,560-61, § 2.2 (1992). In such a 
situation,  [***16] it might not be necessary to understand the market definition to conclude a preliminary injunction should issue. 
The FTC alludes to this theory on appeal, but to the district court it argued simply that the merger would result in a highly 
concentrated PNOS market. "
486,2," Dr. Scheffman did not actually calculate the amount of this loss. He simply predicted that because many Whole Foods and Wild 
Oats customers also shop at conventional supermarkets, the loss would at any rate be too large. "
496,3," My colleagues, and especially the concurrence, hint that the FTC need not demonstrate a likelihood of success to obtain a 
preliminary injunction in a § 7 case. But consistent with the text of the governing statute, § 13 of the FTC Act, we have always 
held that the FTC must show a likelihood of success to obtain a preliminary injunction in a § 7 case. To conclude otherwise 
would be to enhance the FTC's power  [***64] to torpedo mergers well beyond what Congress has authorized. "
498,4," The concurrence disparages the evidence about Whole Foods's prices, calling it ""all-but-meaningless"" and implicitly suggesting 
that Whole Foods manipulated its prices just for the expert study. Concurring Op. at 11. But the concurrence offers no evidence 
for that suggestion. "
500,5," According to the concurrence, the FTC's expert purported to say that Whole Foods could impose a five percent or greater price 
increase because of the number of Wild Oats customers who would switch to Whole Foods rather than conventional 
supermarkets. Concurring Op. at 6. But that bare assertion was unsupported and was premised on the notion that organic 
supermarkets are a separate product market. That premise is of course the issue in dispute. That no doubt explains why the 
FTC never even mentioned this aspect of its expert's report in the argument section of its opening brief. "
501,6," As two antitrust commentators perceptively stated: The basic problem with  [***82] the FTC's position in Whole Foods was that it lacked the pricing evidence it had in Staples,

attempt by the FTC to persuade a court that if you take a CEO's statements about a merger and stir it in with evidence 
showing the existence of several ""practical indicia"" from Brown Shoe, the resulting mixture should trump objective evidence 
about how customers would react in the event of a price increase. It was not successful, and the court's decision 
underscores the dominant influence of economic evidence in merger cases today. Carlton Varner & Heather Cooper, Product Markets in Merger Cases: The Whole Foods Decision (Oct. 2007),

510,9," It should be noted that HN10[
] the Supreme Court has defined a very narrow scope for exceptions to the direct purchaser 
limitation by citing only two situations where the policy reasons do not warrant the rule's application.  [**17] See Ill. Brick, 431 
U.S. at 735-36 (pre-existing cost-plus contract, discussed hereinafter); id. at 736 n.16 (only applicable ""where the direct 
purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer""). The primary exception is a pre-existing cost-plus contract between the direct 
and indirect purchasers. In such a contract, the buyer is committed to purchasing a fixed quantity regardless of price, and the 
seller is insulated from any decrease in sales that might result from passing on the entire overcharge. Id. at 736. Because the 
contract is pre-existing, ""the effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in advance."" Id. Thus, the complexity of market 
interactions do not impact a cost-plus contract, making it easy to demonstrate that the indirect, not direct, purchaser was 
harmed. Id. Here, however, the parties agree that there was no cost-plus contract during the Relevant Period. "
511,10," Stepan also argues that federal antitrust remedies are not inalienable benefits. To support this, Stepan cites In re Fine Paper 
Litigation State of Washington as holding that assignments of claims under the Sherman and Clayton Acts are valid. 632 F.2d 
1081, 1090 (3d Cir. 1980). However, at the time of, and  [**18] in connection with, the sales of the product, direct purchasers 
voluntarily entered into a written contract with the indirect purchaser that assigned any and all claims for illegal overcharges to 
the indirect purchaser. Id. at 1089. The Third Circuit simply enforced assignments of claims that the direct and indirect 
purchasers had bargained for in the context of their sales transactions. Here, Stepan's purchase orders did not contain any 
assignments of claims or benefits obtained in an antitrust settlement. "
512,11," HN13[
] The Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, under  [**23] which any state law interfering with federal law must yield, is the source of the preemption doctrine. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 29, 125 S. Ct. 2195, 162 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005); Gade 
v. Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n, 505 U.S. 88, 108, 112 S. Ct. 2374, 120 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1992). HN14[
] Federal law may preempt state law in any of three ways. First, in enacting the federal law, Congress may 
explicitly define the extent to which it intends to preempt state law. Second, even in the absence of express preemptive 
language, Congress may indicate an intent to occupy an entire field of regulation, in which case the States must leave all 
regulatory activity in that area to the Federal Government. Finally, if Congress has not displaced state regulation entirely, it 
may nonetheless preempt state law to the extent that the state law actually conflicts with federal law. Such a conflict arises 
when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Mich. Canners & Freezers Ass'n, Inc. v. Agric. Mktg. & Bargaining Bd., 467 U.S. 461, 469, 104 S. Ct. 2518, 81 L. Ed. 2d 399 
(1984) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also ARC America, 490 U.S. at 100-01. Because  [**24] Congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in the area of antitrust and states are free to legislate 
remedies for indirect purchasers under their own antitrust laws, preemption arises in this case because of a conflict between 
state and federal law. Although Stepan could have recovered from the antitrust violators as an indirect purchaser under Illinois 
state antitrust law, it did not pursue this recovery. Instead, Stepan seeks Callahan's federal antitrust award in a state unjust 
enrichment action that directly conflicts with the Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rules limiting recovery under federal antitrust 
law to direct purchasers. Although ""the Hanover Shoe [and Illinois Brick] rule[s] den[y] recovery [under federal law] to those 
indirect purchasers who may have been actually injured by antitrust violations,"" Ill. Brick, 431 U.S. at 746, Stepan had a remedy 
available under state antitrust law that posed no preemption problem."
512,12," Because the ruling in this case is based on federal preemption, the Court need not decide whether, in fact, Stepan's cause of 
action could survive a motion brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or one brought under Rule 56, but 
 [**25] premised on a different theory. The Court noted earlier, however, it is difficult to find ""unjust"" the retention of litigation 
damages specifically authorized by law to Callahan and specifically denied to Stepan. "

522,," Workers, 480 F. Supp. 2d 471, 474 (D. Mass. 2007). The Act also prohibits employers from making any ""subsequent deduction

which may be alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and the laborers…."" 40 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1). The state of 
Massachusetts has enacted its own prevailing wage statute, known as a ""Little Davis-Bacon Act,"" which requires contractors 
working on state-subsidized projects to pay no less than the Massachusetts prevailing wage. See G.L. c. 149, § 26. Plaintiffs' 
complaint does not allege  [**11] a direct violation of either the state or federal Davis-Bacon Act; rather, their theory seems to be 
that by violating federal and state prevailing wage laws in its administration of the MRP, Local 7 has exposed itself to antitrust 
liability. "
523,6, We express no opinion regarding  [**14] the substance of Plaintiffs' underlying antitrust claims.
523,7," Local 7, quite correctly, points out that antitrust suits ordinarily entail massive discovery and are expensive to defend. See, e.g., 
Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1967, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)(raising  [**18] the pleading 
requirements for an antitrust claim, in light of the ""unusually high cost of discovery in antitrust cases""). "
524,8," In arriving at its decision, the district court focused almost entirely upon the MRP alone. Thus, for the purpose of determining 
whether the statutory exemption applies, we need go no further; if the MRP alone cannot be afforded the protection of the 
statutory exemption, that settles the question. We are aware, however, that Plaintiffs have alleged a smorgasbord of 
exclusionary conduct including, but not limited to, the MRP. We will examine the other allegations and their impact upon any 
labor exemption available to Local 7 further below."
524,9," For example, there is a letter in the record from Griffin Iron Works, Inc., a signatory contractor, to Local 7, which states that 
""[t]hrough a concentrated effort with the New England District Council and Griffin Iron Works, Cardi's Furniture's new store was 
turned around from a non-union project to a union project,"" and notes that ""Local 7 … agreed to pay $ 10,000.00 towards the 
 [**22] New England District Council's effort to turn this project around."""
524,10," Local 7 misreads the law by muddling the question whether the statutory exemption is applicable with cases where the 
nonstatutory exemption was found inapplicable. The Union cites to Allen Bradley, 325 U.S. at 809, and Connell, 421 U.S. at 623- "
525,24," , for the proposition that ""the test requires evidence of a restraint of trade entered into by non-labor groups."" That is not the 
second prong of the Hutcheson test for the statutory exemption, however; rather, both of those cases dealt with the applicability 
of the nonstatutory exemption. The Court already having found therein a combination between labor and non-labor that removed 
the disputed activity from the protection of the statutory exemption, it was left to decide only whether the combination was 
engaged in activity permitted by federal labor policy favoring collective bargaining (and thus protected by the nonstatutory 
exemption), or activity that constituted an illegal restraint on trade (and thus unprotected by the nonstatutory exemption). It is 
disingenuous for Local 7 to argue that the MRP has no impact on business competition when its very purpose be taken up 
 [**23] under our discussion of the nonstatutory exemption, infra."
525,11," Because the HN6[
] conduct at issue need fail only one prong of the Hutcheson test in order to remove it from the protection of the statutory exemption, we find it unnecessary to review the district court's determination that Local 7 was acting in its own 
legitimate self-interest. "
526,12," In its order granting summary judgment to Local 7 on Plaintiffs' federal law claims,  [**27] the district court appeared to almost 
entirely ignore these other allegations and focused solely on the MRP. The court did state, within the discussion of Plaintiffs' 
LMRA claim, that ""[t]here is nothing in the record to support plaintiffs' assertion that the Union resorted to coercive restraints or 
tactics,"" perhaps indicating that it was refusing to credit Plaintiffs' other allegations. However, with only that cryptic remark to 
guide us, we remain somewhat mystified as to why the district court passed over these allegations entirely in its discussion of 
Plaintiffs' antitrust claims. Whether we are entitled to credit these allegations is certainly material to our legal analysis: if 
Plaintiffs' allegations are taken as true, they would appear to nudge this case away from an allowable restraint arrived at through 
collective bargaining, as job targeting programs alone have been found to be, see, e.g., Local Union 257, 121 F.3d at 1186-87, 
and towards the type of illegal restraint on business competition considered verboten by the Supreme Court in cases such as 
United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) and Connell. "
527,13," Because the district court issued its ruling on the antitrust claims solely on the basis of the statutory exemption, neither party 
on appeal has sufficiently raised or adequately briefed the question whether a Davis-Bacon violation could render union activity 
ineligible for the nonstatutory exemption. We thus decline to opine on that question at this time. See United States v. Zannino, 
895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)(""[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner [on appeal], unaccompanied by some effort at

530,17," plaintiffs' also argue that the district court's decision is inconsistent with case law finding no pre-emption of state prevailing 
wage statutes, but plaintiffs' complaint asserted no claim under the Massachusetts prevailing wage statute and plaintiffs did not 
directly advance that argument below in their  [**43] opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss. We therefore will not consider it 
here. See McCoy v. Mass. Instit. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991)(""It is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in 
the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal.""). "
533,1," For the same reason, the Court will not conclude that A.B. Dick directly conflicts with Scripps or Molins PLC. Without a direct 
conflict, Apotex's argument that a Federal Circuit ""panel is obligated to follow the earlier ruling"" must fail. See Newell Cos., Inc v. 
Kenney Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (""Where there is direct conflict, the precedential decision is the first. Even if 
all comments in the decision considered here are not completely harmonious, Newell points to no actual conflict, and we see 
none.""). "
535,2," Teva does not argue that the claims fail the second part of the PRE test. Therefore, the Court need not examine the Teva's 
subjective motivation for  [*14] bringing suit on this motion."
535,3," Federal Circuit law, as opposed to Third Circuit law, controls ""whether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to 
strip a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws."" Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovation, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1068 (Fed. 
Cir. 1998). "
536,4," Teva's knowledge is relevant to the ""objectively baseless"" inquiry because it is goes to whether Teva had ""a reasonable belief 
that there is a chance that a claim may be held valid upon adjudication."" PRE 508 U.S. at 62-63; see also C.R. Bard, 157 F.3d at 
1368 (""Conduct prohibited under antitrust law includes bringing suit to enforce a patent with knowledge that the patent is invalid 
or not infringed, and the litigation is conducted for anti-competitive purposes."") (emphasis added)."
536,5," Teva's citation to Viva Optique, Inc. v. Contour Optik, Inc., No. 03 Civ. 8948 (LTS)(AJP), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91421, 2007 
WL 4302729, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2007) is unhelpful because in that case, Plaintiffs claim for a declaration of invalidity had 
previously been dismissed and the complaint was ""bereft of any factual allegation that would support a finding that the patent 
infringement claims . . . are objectively baseless."" (Teva Br. at 7.) Here, invalidity  [*19] is still contested and the complaint 
contains sufficient factual allegations with respect to the objective prong of the PRE test."
536,6," As noted above (see footnote 2, supra), Teva does not contend that the allegations would fail under the subjective prong of the 
PRE test. "
537,7," Unlike the determination of antitrust immunity, the substantive aspects of the antitrust counterclaims are controlled by Third 
Circuit law. See Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1068. "
539,8," Rule 42(b) states, in pertinent part: ""For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a

College Club Beverages Co., Inc. and Andorra Ridge, the three other plaintiffs originally named in the Amended Complaint, have 
withdrawn as  [*6] putative class representatives."
542,3," In 1982, G.D. Searle & Co. established The NutraSweet Group as a separate operating division responsible for the 
manufacturing and marketing of Aspartame. In 1985, this Monsato acquired G.D. Searle & Co. Monsanto later sold its interest in 
the NutraSweet Co. to a group of investors. "
543,4," After 1995, Nog purchased Aspartame from another distributor, 4 the Norben Company. In 2004, Nog substituted Sucralose, 
another artificial sweetener, for Aspartame. "
544,5," Sorbee stopped manufacturing sugar-free products in 2002 and thereafter 5 only acted as a distributor of sugar-free 
 [*10] products. "
545,6," As previously noted, at summary judgment the Court must 6 determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding 
that (a) Defendants engaged in affirmative acts of concealment designed to mislead Plaintiffs regarding facts supporting their 
claim, (b) Plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence and (c) Plaintiffs were not aware, nor should they have been aware,  [*16] of 
the facts supporting their claim until a time within the limitations period measured backwards from when the Plaintiffs filed their 
complaint. See Forbes v. Eagleson, 228 F.3d 471, 487 (3d Cir. 2000) "
546,7," In addition to not taking any steps to investigate their 7 claims prior to becoming aware of their existence from counsels, neither 
Plaintiff took any steps to investigate their claims once they were made aware of their claims."
546,8," According to Sorbee, Andrew Feinberg, the employee that purchased 8 Aspartame, left  [*19] the company in September 2002 
and his files have not been recovered. There is no indication in the record that Sorbee has attempted to obtain any information 
related to this matter from Mr. Feinberg nor has it requested this Court's assistance in obtaining information from Mr. Feinberg. 
At summary judgment, this Court must take the record as it stands."
546,9," The requirement that defendant first point to the existence of ""red flags"" or ""storm warning"" and only then establish that 
reasonable diligence would have lead to an awareness of the claims is applicable to determining whether a plaintiff is on inquiry 
notice in the context of the injury discovery rule, which is used to determine the accrual of a claim in a civil RICO suit. See Cetel 
v. Kirwan Financial Group, Inc., 460 F.3d 494, 507 (3d Cir. 2006). The discovery rule, however, is distinct from the doctrine of 
equitable tolling. See Forbes v. Eagleson, 228 F.3d 471, 486 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 
38 F.3d 1380, 1390 (3d Cir.1994)). Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiffs cite cases that set forth this standard in the context 
of fraudulent concealment, it is the opinion of this Court that this does not adequately set forth the appropriate standard 
established by the Third Circuit and which we are bound to follow. "
547,10," In a Memorandum and Order denying Defendants' motion t 10 o dismiss the claims brought by the Plaintiffs, the Court noted 
the omission of this information. Specifically, the Court stated ""While the complaint is not robust in its factual allegations "
548,," regarding due diligence, especially in that it provides no indication of how plaintiffs ultimately learned of the alleged conspiracy, 
this is not fatal to plaintiff's fraudulent concealment allegation at this time."" (Memorandum and Order 13, Jan.  [*25] 18, 2007). "
557,1," ""Warner Chilcott"" refers to Warner Chilcott Holdings Company III, Ltd., Warner Chilcott Corporation, Warner Chilcott (US) Inc., 
Warner Chilcott Company, Inc., and Galen (Chemicals), Ltd."
557,2," On July 10, 2008, the Court approved a settlement  [**8] between Plaintiffs and Warner Chilcott that dismissed Warner Chilcott 
as a Defendant in the above-captioned cases. See Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., Civ. A. No. 05-2195, 
[181] Order and [182] Mem. Op., 565 F. Supp. 2d 49, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52410 (July 10, 2008). Barr is the sole remaining 
Defendant."
557,3," As the Court previously informed the parties, see, e.g., No. 05-2195, Order at 1 (Dec. 9, 2005), the Court strictly adheres to the 
text of Local Civil Rule 56.1 when resolving motions for summary judgment. See Burke v. Gould, 351 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 286 F.3d 
513, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (district  [**10] courts need to invoke Local Civil Rule 56.1 before applying it to the case). Accordingly, 
the Court ""assumes that facts identified by the moving party in its statement of material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is 
controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion."" LCvR 56.1. Thus, in most instances the Court 
shall cite only to Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts (""Pls.' Stmt."") or Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (""Def.'s Stmt."") 
unless a statement is contradicted by the opposing party. Where a party objects to relevant aspects of an opposing party's 
proffered material fact, the Court shall cite to Plaintiffs' Response to Def.'s Stmt. (""Pls.' Resp. Stmt."") or Defendant's Response to 
Pls.' Stmt. (""Def.'s Resp. Stmt.""), as necessary. Where a party objects to a proffered fact based on its materiality, or seeks to 
merely re-characterize a fact contained in the opposing party's Statement, the Court shall disregard the objection because it 
does not comport with the requirements of LCvR 56.1. The Court shall also cite directly to evidence in the record, where 
appropriate, to provide additional information not covered in either of the parties'  [**11] Statements. Finally, the Court notes that 
Plaintiffs submitted a ""counterstatement of material facts"" that Barr argues should be disregarded because it contains facts that 
are voluminous and/or immaterial. See Def.'s Resp. Stmt. to Pls.' Counterstatement of Facts at 2. The Court finds that both 
Parties included voluminous and/or immaterial ""facts"" in their Statements, and that there is no basis to disregard Plaintiffs' 
factual counterstatement. "
558,4," Plaintiffs deny that BMS was obligated to supply Warner Chilcott with ""line extension"" products, citing section 2.10.1 of the 
agreement. See Pls.' Resp. Stmt. P 7; Pls.' Stmt. P 52; Def.'s Mot., Ex. 42 (1/26/00 Agreement). Plaintiffs' argument and citation 
are puzzling given that the very next section of the agreement states that ""[o]nce [Warner Chilcott] has obtained any regulatory 
approvals that may be required, if any, to market a Line Extension Product in any country, such Line Extension Product shall be 
included as a Product under this Agreement . . . ."" Def.'s Mot, Ex. 42 § 2.10.02. Plaintiffs' meritless objection is, in any event, 
irrelevant to the disposition of the instant motions."
558,5," A company seeking to market a new drug in the United  [**12] States must first obtain approval by filing a New Drug 
Application (""NDA"") with the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). Pls.' Stmt. P 48; 21 U.S.C. § 355. The NDA 
must include reports and other materials showing that the drug is safe and effective for use. Pls.' Stmt. P 48; 21 U.S.C. § 
355(b)(1). A company seeking approval to market a generic drug may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (""ANDA"") with 
the FDA, which allows the company to rely on the FDA's prior determinations, made in the course of approving a new drug 
pursuant to an NDA, that the active ingredients of the proposed new generic drug are safe and effective. Pls.' Stmt. P 48; 21 
U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)."
558,6," Barr disputes the magnitude of Warner Chilcott's lost sales projections. See Def.'s Resp. Stmt. P 6. For example, Barr contests 
the forecasts described by Mr. Poll, apparently on the basis that Mr. Poll was unsure of his projections.  [**15] Id. The fact 
remains, however, that Warner Chilcott projected substantial lost sales and profits due to the entry of a generic version of 
Ovcon. "
559,7," The FTC also submitted a statement to the Court to ""correct misrepresentations"" concerning how Defendants Barr and (at the 
time) Warner Chilcott were characterizing their interactions with the FTC during this period. See State of Colorado v. Warner 
Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., No. 05-2182 (June 21, 2006), Docket No. [49]. According to the FTC, ""more than a month 
 [**18] before [Defendants] entered into the final agreement, they were aware that Commission staff had significant concerns 
about the defendants' agreement and was investigating the transaction."" Id. at 1. The FTC characterizes ""Defendants' efforts to 
make relevant to this litigation their interactions in 2003 with some FTC staff members--along with what they deem the 
Commission's lack of dispatch in issuing its complaint"" as a ""sideshow"" that is ""misleading."" Id. at 2."
559,8," The agreement actually consists of two separate agreements that were simultaneously executed -- an Option and License 
Agreement and a Finished Product Supply Agreement. See Def.'s Mot., Ex. 85 (3/24/04 Finished Product Supply Agreement), 
Ex. 86 (3/24/04 Option and License Agreement). Following the convention of the parties and unless otherwise specified, the 
Court shall refer to both agreements as Barr and Warner Chilcott's single ""Agreement."" "
560,9," Barr did not begin purchasing Ovcon from Barr until May 2005 (approximately one year after execution of the licensing 
agreement) and continued to receive its supply from BMS until that time. Pls.' Stmt. PP 86-87. Barr explains that it was not in a 
position to immediately begin production of Ovcon once Warner Chilcott exercised its licensing option. Def.'s Resp. Stmt. P 86."
560,10," Plaintiffs object to the relevance and description of Barr's sampling explanation, but do not object to the underlying premise 
that companies such as Warner Chilcott engage in the practice of sampling for their brand-name products, and that such 
practices are generally terminated once a generic equivalent of the branded drug is introduced into the market. Pls.' Resp. Stmt. 
PP 25-27."
560,11," Both parties include extensive ""facts"" related to market definition and competition in their factual statements that are far from 
undisputed. The Court shall address these areas in the context of the parties' summary judgment arguments, where they 
 [**22] are more appropriately considered. "
561,12," The captions on these briefs include State of Colorado v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III., Ltd., No. 05-2182. The plaintiffs in 
that proceeding reached a settlement with Barr on February 25, 2008, after the above briefing had already been completed, and 
are therefore not parties to this opinion. See Civ. A. No. 05-2182, Docket No. [157] (Stipulated Final Order and Permanent 
Injunction)."
561,13," The Court granted the Parties' requests for leave to file their pleadings and accompanying exhibits under seal, but required 
that they ""file on the public docket a redacted copy of all documents filed under seal."" Min. Order dated Nov. 28, 2007. "
564,14," For this reason, the Court rejects as legally inaccurate Plaintiffs' argument that ""a decision to apply the per se rule does not 
depend on any inquiry into market definition or market power . . . [because that inquiry] is made only after a court has decided 
not to apply the per se rule."" Pls.' Reply at 8 (emphasis in original).  [**37] Even a cursory examination of the precedents in the 
text above reveals that courts must evaluate relevant market dynamics prior to condemning a restraint as a per se violation of 
the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 459 (discussing group boycotts and explaining that ""the per 
se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to 
discourage them from doing business with a competitor,"" thereby necessitating an inquiry into market power prior to application 
of the per se rule). "
565,15," Plaintiffs attempt to diminish the significance of Dr. Rubinfeld's concession by characterizing it as testimony relating to a ""legal 
standard."" See Pls.' Reply at 5 n.9. While Plaintiffs are correct that Dr. Rubinfeld's testimony as to whether the Agreement 
should be analyzed under the rule of reason or the per se rule would have no bearing on the Court's determination of the same, 
Dr. Rubinfeld's analysis concerning the economic effects of delayed generic entry is an appropriate area for expert testimony 
and is a relevant consideration in the Court's analysis."
565,16," Plaintiffs argue that ""there is ample evidence . . . that the  [**42] supply relationship [between Barr and Warner Chilcott] was 
merely a pretext to disguise the Agreement's actual purpose . . . ."" Pls.' Reply at 4. As Plaintiffs concede, however, whether the 
supply relationship was pretextual ""must be determined by the trier of fact and cannot be resolved on summary judgment."" Pls.' 
Opp'n at 12 n.11. "
566,17," Plaintiffs' reliance on Engine Specialities, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd. is also unpersuasive. 605 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1979).  [**44] In 
that case, two companies entered into a horizontal agreement to allocate certain markets pursuant to an envisioned joint 
venture. Id. at 8. Even though the parties implemented their agreement, the joint venture ""never materialized,"" resulting in a 
naked restraint on competition without the procompetitive benefits of the joint venture. Id. at 11. Cf. Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 
U.S. 1, 6, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (""though [a joint venture's] pricing policy maybe price fixing in a literal sense, it 
is not price fixing in the antitrust sense,"" and joint venture pricing decisions ""do not fall within the narrow category of activity that 
is per se unlawful under § 1 of the Sherman Act""). Unlike Engine Specialities, Barr and Warner Chilcott did execute their 
exclusive supply relationship, and its resulting effects are unclear for the reasons described in the text above."
566,18," The Court notes that Barr raised two other arguments on which the Court expressly does not rely. First, Barr argues that the 
per se rule is inappropriate in instances where a party marshals evidence of procompetitive effects. The Court rejects this 
argument because the Supreme Court ""has consistently rejected the notion that naked restraints of trade are to be tolerated 
because they are well intentioned or because they are allegedly developed to increase competition."" United States v. Topco 
Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). Thus, if the Court were to find that the Agreement 
were subject to the per se rule as a naked restraint of trade, Barr's proffered procompetitive benefits would not alter that finding. 
Second, Barr repeatedly emphasizes that it submitted its Letter of Intent with Warner Chilcott to the FTC before finalizing the 
contemplated Agreement.  [**47] See Def.'s Opp'n, Ex. 80 at 1 (4/30/03 Letter from M. Kovner to Pre-merger Notification Office 
and the Director of Operations and Civil Enforcement). Barr argues that the Agreement could not constitute a naked restraint of 
trade because the FTC waited approximately two years to bring suit against Barr. See, e.g., Def.'s Opp'n at 3. The Court rejects 
the idea that the FTC's investigation and ultimate filing of charges against Barr for a per se violation of the antitrust laws 
somehow belies Barr's alleged anticompetitive conduct simply because the FTC did not move with the dispatch that Barr would 
expect. "
569,19," Plaintiffs argue that Barr's counterclaim filed in  [**57] Celgene Corp. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., No. 07-286, 2008 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 47639 (D. N.J.), a case concerning a different branded drug, contains statements that support Plaintiffs' position in this 
case. See Pls.' Opp'n at 22-23. While this argument may reflect the researching adeptness of Plaintiffs' counsel, the Court 
cannot make a finding as to the relevant market or scope of competition in this case by relying on arguments raised in a different 
case involving a different product market--particularly where Barr disputes the similarities of the markets between that case and 
the one at present. See Def.'s Reply at 22 n.14 (""[t]he product at issue in that case, thalidomide, was a highly controlled 
substance with highly specialized therapeutic uses . . . unlike the market for oral contraceptives in which there are over 80 
products available on the market that are prescribed for precisely the same purpose . . . ."")."
569,20," The parties do not appear to dispute that Ovcon and its generic equivalents are in the  [**59] same market; they dispute 
whether the market also consists of other oral contraceptives. See Pls.' Opp'n at 26 n.39. Thus, the Court's references to 
""Ovcon"" (as opposed to ""non-Ovcon oral contraceptives"") throughout this section are meant to denote both Ovcon and generic 
equivalents of Ovcon unless otherwise specified. "
572,21," Plaintiffs counter that Barr's internal documents suggest that Barr considered the relevant market to be limited to Ovcon and 
its generic equivalents. See Rubinfeld Rebuttal Report P 33 (""in its various sales forecasts for generic Ovcon, Barr identifies the 
price of generic Ovcon as a percentage of the branded Ovcon price. Barr then calculates the expected market share of generic 
Ovcon as a percentage of a market consisting only of branded Ovcon and it's A-rated generics."")."
572,22," Plaintiffs seek to diminish the importance of promotional activities such as sampling by arguing that ""Warner Chilcott did not 
react by increasing sampling during periods when entry of other branded and less expensive generic non-Ovcon oral 
contraceptives occurred."" Pls.' Opp'n at 28; Def's Mot., Ex. 7 P 27 (Rebuttal Report of Keith Leffler) (""the sampling of Ovcon 35 
was relatively constant from April 2002 through 2005, a period of substantial entry of both branded and generic oral 
contraceptives""). "
573,23," Defendants also quote from a book that Dr. Rubinfeld co-authored that stated ""[i]in the pharmaceutical industry . . . [m]arkets 
are usually defined in terms of therapeutic classes of drugs."" Def.'s Mot. at 31 (quoting Pindyck, Robert S. and Rubinfeld, Daniel 
L., Microeconomics (6th ed. 2005) at 10). The Court is unpersuaded that the general statements contained in this book have any 
application to the particular market at issue in this case. "
574,24," Although the Court does not reach the merits of Barr's proffered procompetitive benefits, the Court notes that ""benefits"" are 
only procompetitive when they promote and protect competition, not competitors, see Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 224, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993), and when they do not rely on ""the assumption 
that competition itself is unreasonable,"" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 696, 98 S. 
Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978). "
575,25," Barr cites to In re Ditropan XL Antitrust Litigation for support, but it has no relevance to the present matter. 529 F. Supp. 2d 
1098 (N.D. Cal. 2007). In that case, the court merely held that the plaintiff had failed to allege in its complaint that it had received 
an assignment from the wholesaler Cardinal. Id. at 1100. The court therefore dismissed the plaintiff's antitrust claim with leave to 
amend. Id. "
584,1," RBCGF drugs treat severe anemia, which is most commonly seen in patients (1) with chronic kidney disease pre-dialysis or 
while undergoing dialysis, (2) undergoing chemotherapy, or (3) undergoing zidovudine treatment for HIV. WBCGF drugs treat 
neutropenia, a white blood cell deficiency and common side-effect of chemotherapy."
584,2," The only other WBCGF drug sold is Leukine, distributed by Berlex Laboratories. Ortho does not sell a WBCGF drug."
584,3, The threshold for Aranesp was set at dollar amounts equal to 65% of a clinic's prior RBCGF drug purchases. 
585,4," The Complaint alleges two kinds of antitrust activity: (1) unlawful tying, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and (2) 
monopolization of the RBCGF oncology clinic market, in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See  [*9] Compl., PP 96-100. "
586,5," In contrast, the standard articulated in Conley was that the ""complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless 
it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 
Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46. The Supreme Court abrogated the Conley ""no set of facts"" standard in Bell Atlantic. Bell Atlantic 
Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1969."
586,6," The Eastern District of Pennsylvania followed the leading case for one of the two competing approaches - the ""package"" 
approach - in rejecting the defendant's argument that summary judgment should be granted because there was insufficient proof "
587,," of antitrust injury. Pennsylvania v. Milk Indus. Mgmt. Corp., 812 F.Supp. 500, 508 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (citing Kypta v. McDonald's 
Corp., 671 F.2d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 857, 103 S. Ct. 127, 74 L. Ed. 2d 109 (1982)). In that case, 
however, the antitrust suit was not based on illegal tying, but rather on a conspiracy to restrain trade by submitting rigged bids 
for a school district's milk contracts."
587,7," The Courts of Appeals of the Fifth, Seventh, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have defined antitrust injury according to the package 
approach. United Farmers Agents Ass'n. v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 89 F.3d 233, 237 (5th Cir. 1996); Will v. Comprehensive 
Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 672-73 (7th Cir. 1985); Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43, 52 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 
405 U.S. 955, 92 S. Ct. 1173, 31 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1972); Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F2d 705 718-19 
(11th Cir. 1984);  [*19] see also L. Knife & Son, Inc. v. Banfi Prod. Corp., 118 F.R.D. 269, 271 (D.Mass. 1987) (applying package 
approach to calculation of damages in ruling on discovery dispute); Freeland v. AT&T Corp., 238 F.R.D. 130, 149-50 (S.D.N.Y. 
2006) (applying package approach to identify antitrust injury-in-fact in denying motion for class certification). "
588,8," Amgen correctly points out that injury-in-fact is also a requirement of Article III standing under the United States Constitution, 
and its absence would deprive this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court, however, notes that its determination that 
SMW lacks statutory standing to pursue a claim for injunctive relief under the Clayton Act does not deprive this Court of subject 
matter jurisdiction over the entire action,  [*21] which is also properly before this Court by virtue of class action diversity 
jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. 1332(d). The Complaint asserts claims under the antitrust statutes of 28 different states, and the 
matter of statutory standing under those statutes has not been briefed. Based on the papers submitted on this motion, it is not 
clear to this Court whether those various jurisdictions would define antitrust injury in the same way federal law does, in particular 
because the federal jurisprudence on what constitutes antitrust injury in a tying arrangement is not settled. Moreover, as 
discussed in Section IV.A, class certification must be decided before the Court reaches the question of SMW's Article III standing 
with regard to the state claims. The Court finds that it would be premature to make a determination on SMW's standing to pursue 
various state antitrust claims based on lack of injury-in-fact, particularly where the parties have not had the opportunity to brief 
the law of each state adequately. "
589,9," Count Three, for violation of California's unfair business practices statute, does not concern  [*26] antitrust law, as do all other 
claims in the Complaint. The Court's discussion of the legal sufficiency of the federal and state antitrust claims is not applicable 
to the claim asserted in Count Three. The Court, however, will not deal with that claim in a separate section of this Opinion. 
Though Amgen moves to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, its argument regarding the insufficiency of the California unfair 
business practices claim appears only in a short footnote. The Court is not in a position, based on this briefing, to make a well- "
590,," informed decision on whether Count Three states a claim upon which relief may be granted. Therefore, to the extent this motion 
seeks to seeks to dismiss Count Three, it will be denied without prejudice."

Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin. "
591,11," The Complaint does not expressly request injunctive relief under the state statutes. Following an assertion that Amgen's 
conduct has violated the statutes, the Complaint state its ""Prayer for Relief,"" asking for ""damages . . . and such other relief as 
this Court may deem just and proper."" "
592,12," Though urged by Amgen, the Court declines to take judicial notice of facts alleged by SMW in a lawsuit pending in California. "

choice for transferee district."

Co., Inc.; Honeywell International Inc.; Wix Filtration Corp. LLC; Mann + Hummel U.S.A., Inc.; Purolator Filters N.A., LLC; and 
United Components, Inc. "
613,1," In his notice of appeal and appellate briefs, plaintiff did not include any reference to Corsaw Log & Lumber, Inc., or Illinois River 
Holdings, Inc. Accordingly, we consider plaintiff Edwards, as an individual, as the sole plaintiff for purposes of this appeal. "
623,1," ""[A] third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards"" is the ""quick look"" rule of reason. 
Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 461 n.6 (D.N.J. 1998).  [*11] This method ""applies in cases where per se 
condemnation is inappropriate but where no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character 
of an inherently suspect restraint."" Gordon, 423 F.3d at 209-210 (citing Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669). Under the ""quick look"" 
method, ""the competitive harm is presumed and the defendant must set forth some competitive justification for the restraints."" Id. "
624,," at 210. ""[T]he quick look approach may be applied only when an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics 
could conclude that the arrangement in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Id. As the 
Second Circuit found in Todd, ""[t]he alleged conduct in this case-the exchange of information-is not so inherently or intuitively 
anticompetitive."" 275 F.3d at 207. "
626,2," In this context, the Todd Court stated that the fact that the plaintiff, Robert Todd, ""left Exxon for a higher paying job outside of 
the industry . . . is but one small piece of the broader cross elasticity analysis."" Id. at 204 & n.7."
626,3," The Second Circuit noted that because of these differences, the large proposed class might have difficulty with class 
certification. This proved to be the case. "
627,4," Direct proof was not a contested issue in Broadcom. Indeed, the court identified ""the relevant market as the market for 
Qualcomm's proprietary WCDMA technology"" and ruled that the ""Complaint adequately alleged . . . monopoly power in the 
relevant market."" 501 F.3d at 315. "
628,5," None of the cases cited by Plaintiff stand for the proposition that ""direct evidence"" can be completely untethered or unmoored 
from a roughly identified relevant market. Indeed, the only other Third Circuit case cited by Plaintiff on this point presumes the 
existence of some roughly  [*27] definable relevant product market. See Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 668 (""The Plaintiff bears the 
initial burden . . . of showing . . . anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets"")."
628,6," Notably, Plaintiffs do not argue that they can prove market power by direct evidence in the job markets relevant to the ten 
 [*28] individual Plaintiffs in this case. For example, Plaintiffs do not contend that they could show that there was anticompetitive 
conduct in the labor market applicable to Ms. Todd. Nor do Plaintiffs contend that they can show that the labor market applicable 
to Ms. Todd is limited to the oil and petrochemical industry. "
629,7," Moreover, it is not clear that the evidence put forth by Defendants was before the Second Circuit in Todd. Although the parties 
dispute the precise extent of discovery that has taken place, there was some degree of discovery in the Todd v. Exxon matter 
after the Second Circuit remanded the matter. (56(f) Aff. at 2; Defs.' Reply Br. at 14 n.4.) Moreover, in this consolidated action, 
the parties have  [*34] conducted class discovery, which included depositions of the individual plaintiffs. "
630,8," At oral argument, Plaintiffs seemingly conceded this point by acknowledging that they were not alleging the existence of an 
agreement subject to per se condemnation. "
638,1," Plaintiffs' original Motion for Class Certification, Appointment of Class Representatives, Appointment of Class Counsel, and 
Approval of Notice of Class Action was filed on December 1, 2005 (Doc. 452). As the parties filed updated documents in light of 
discovery, the Court DENIES the original motion as moot."
638,2," For the purposes of the Motion for Class Certification, the Court considered and accepts the Plaintiffs' expert opinion but finds 
nonetheless that his opinions did not justify class certification. "
639,3," Plaintiffs alleged that to perpetrate the scheme, TCO later convinced two other pipeline companies to participate because their 
pipeline systems interconnected with TCO's interstate pipeline system. TCO and Columbia Gulf later involved Dominion Cove 
Point LNG, L.P. f/k/a Cove Point LNG L.P. in the  [*6] alleged scheme as they needed more pipeline to free up capacity. Cove 
Point has since been voluntarily dismissed by Plaintiffs."
639,4, Dynergy Inc. is a holding company which through Dynergy Marketing and Trade engaged in the alleged conduct. 
642,5," On April 15, 2008, the parties stipulated dismissal of Dominion Cove Point LNG, LP, Dominion Cove Point Company, LLC, 
Columbia LNG Corporation, and CLNG Corporation. "
644,6," Plaintiffs propose  [*28] to define the class as follows: ""All purchasers, marketers, wholesalers, sellers and/or shippers of 
natural gas (except local distribution companies, shippers that ship gas solely for their own consumption) that had one or more 
service agreements with Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (""TCO"") and/or Columbia Gulf Transmission Company 
(""Gulf""), or which obtained rights to one or more of such service agreements by means of capacity release, or which used one or 
more of such service agreements held in the name of another as part of a joint venture, or the successor-in-interest to any of the 
aforementioned entities, from February 1, 1996 to May 31, 1999 (the ""Class Period"") and/or from June 1, 1999 to the present 
(the ""Extended Class Period""), excluding shippers that participated in illegal gas imbalance transactions with TCO and Gulf "
645,," during the Class Period and/or Extended Class Period."" Defendants argue that this definition is overly broad, in that it includes 
companies that are no longer in business or were not in business throughout the class period, as well as companies that 
received benefits from the ""illegal scheme."" "
648,7," ""The primary distinction between W.Va. Code § 47-18-3(a) and Section 1 of the Sherman Act is that the West Virginia statute 
applies to contracts and conspiracies in restraint of trade 'in this State' while the federal statute is applicable to contracts and 
conspiracies 'in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.'"" Kessel, 648 S.E.2d at 375. 
The Court stated, ""we must presume that the Legislature knew the scope of federal antitrust law and the terms of art utilized 
therein at the time it enacted the WVATA and directed its construction in harmony with federal law."" Id. at 376. After reviewing 
precedents, the Court concluded that ""policy considerations suggest following federal precedent for substantive offenses"" under 
WVATA also. Id. at 379. The Court explained, ""[w]ithout uniform construction  [*43] between state and federal antitrust laws, 
businesses will have a difficult time predicting the antitrust implications of their business decisions. Enforcement of state and 
federal antitrust laws will also be aided by a policy of uniform interpretation."" Id. "
668,1," MasterCard also moves in a footnote in its motions that ""[f]or the reasons set forth in Visa's motion,"" that any claims for third-
party acquiring based on the CPP should be time barred; this motion is DENIED for the reasons set forth in this section. "
683,1," That plaintiffs now characterize this litigation as involving a horizontal conspiracy is of little relevance. The Court must examine 
the factual allegations made by plaintiffs rather than the labels plaintiffs place on defendant's conduct. "
686,2," Many cases also refer to cross-elasticity of demand as important to defining the relevant market. See, e.g., Queen City Pizza v. 
Domino's Pizza, 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3rd Cir. 1997). Cross-elasticity of demand refers to the relationship between the price of one 
product and the demand for another. The cross-elasticity of demand between two products is high if an increase in one's price 
causes an increase in the other's demand. See Philip A. Freeda & Herbert Hovencamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust 
Principles and Their Applications P 562. Plaintiffs do allege, at paragraph 43 of the FAC, that ""Brighton-brand products are 
distinct products characterized by an inelasticity of demand."" Plaintiffs have not, however, alleged facts which explain their 
conclusory allegation. This is precisely the type of conclusory allegations the Supreme Court cautioned against in Twombly, 127 
S. Ct. at 1966  [*29] (""[s]omething beyond the mere possibility of [relief] must be alleged lest a plaintiff with a largely groundless 
claim be allowed to take up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of 
the settlement value."")"
686,3," Plaintiffs also ignore the obvious defect in their attempt to group products with widely disparate uses in a single market. As 
defendant properly notes, picture frames do not compete with women's handbags and shoes do not compete with jewelry."

687,6," This statement of the Supreme Court's holding in Kodak is from the Sixth Circuit's decision in Tarrant Service Agency, Inc. v. 
American Standard, Inc., 12 F.3d 609 (6th Cir. 1993). "
688,7," In fact, the Sixth Circuit, in examining the Kodak decision, appears to have found the ""lock-in effect of Kodak's restrictive parts 
policy to be largely determinative in PSI Repair Services, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 104 F.3d 811, 818 (6th Cir. 1997)(finding the 
primary equipment market to be the relevant market and holding ""that an antitrust plaintiff cannot succeed on a Kodak-type 
theory when the defendant has not changed its policy after locking-in some of its customers, and the defendant has been 
otherwise forthcoming about its pricing structure and service policies"")."
688,8," Plaintiffs initially argue that ""defendant fails to identify how its vertical minimum resale pricing activities have benefitted 
consumers."" Memo. in Opposition, [Doc. 17], p. 16. This argument, however, improperly attempts to shift the burden on the issue 
of anticompetitive effect to the defendant. The burden is on the plaintiffs to plead and establish that Leegin resale price 
maintenance agreements have anticompetitive effects. "
690,9," Indeed, the only case which the parties have cited or which this Court could locate which applies a standard of liability different 
from that established under the federal antitrust statutes is Freeman Industries, LLC v. Eastman Chemical Company. The 
Freeman case, however, deals with a question of statutory interpretation peculiar to the language of TTPA. Nothing in the 
language of Tennessee Code Annotated § 47-25-101, however, deals with the question of whether to examine resale price 
maintenance agreements through a per se analysis or the rule of reason. As the Tennessee Supreme Court points out in 
Freeman, states may provide a remedy under their state antitrust  [*43] statutes which is not provided by the federal antitrust 
statutes. Freeman, 172 S.W.3d at 518-19. This is not one of those cases, however, where it appears that the Tennessee 
Legislature has, by statute, extended the reach of the state antitrust statute beyond that of the federal antitrust law. "
693,1," In the First Amended Complaint, plaintiff refers to the two entities collectively as ""Sunham Defendants."" (See FAC P 10.) 
Defendants, while noting that Ham King Enterprises, Inc. and Sunham Home Fashions, LLC are ""distinct entities with separate 
business operations,"" (see Mot. at 1 n.2), have adopted plaintiff's terminology for purposes of the instant motion, (see id.). "
694,2," The motion was denied in part to the extent defendants moved to dismiss defendants Yung and Courbanou pursuant to 
 [*3] Rule 12(b)(2), without prejudice to defendants refiling such a motion in the event either Yung or Courbanou was named in 
an amended complaint. (See Order filed April 29, 2008 at 3:20-23.) Plaintiffs subsequently named Yung and Courbanou as 
defendants in the FAC and defendants have, in the instant motion, again moved to dismiss Yung and Courbanou pursuant to 
Rule 12(b)(2)."
694,3," Paragraph 20 of the FAC states, in its entirety: ""On information and belief, in an effort to maintain their market share against competitors such as [plaintiff], Defendants 
engage in certain illegal and/or unfair business practices."" (FAC P 20.) "
695,4," Exclusive dealing arrangements are not evaluated as a ""per se"" violation of antitrust laws, but rather under the ""rule of reason."" 
See Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 1997)."
695,5," Indeed, plaintiff acknowledges that ""[t]he true  [*8] names and capacities of . . . the suppliers, designers and manufacturers 
who have coordinated with the Sunham Defendants in boycotting Plaintiff . . . are unknown to the Plaintiff."" (See FAC P 14.)"
695,6," Plaintiff alleges ""the specific market at issue in this case concerns the distribution channel through which top-of-the-bed linens, 
such as quilts, duvets, coverlets, and other such bed coverings that are manufactured in China, are imported/distributed into the 
United States."" (See FAC P 2.) Plaintiff further alleges that ""the market affected by defendants['] unlawful conduct consists of 
these mid-quality, low-cost bed coverings that are sold by intermediaries such as Plaintiff to bulk-purchaser, value-oriented, 
directed retailers (e.g., Target, Mervyns) or warehouse stores (e.g., Sam's Club, Costco), who, in turn, ultimately resell such 
products to American consumers."" (See id.)"
695,7," Plaintiff does not allege, for example, that the geographic origin of the products at issue is in any manner significant to the 
relevant consumers."
695,8," The Court's ruling in this regard is not based on any evidence for which defendants sought judicial notice. Consequently, the 
Court does not reach the parties' arguments with respect to the propriety of the Court's taking such notice. "
696,9," Defendant's reliance on Buckland v. Threshold Enterprises, Ltd., 155 Cal.App.4th 798, 66 Cal. Rptr. 3d 543 (2007) is 
unavailing, for the reason that the court explicitly limited its conclusion therein to the facts of that case, ""which involve[d] an 
individual who voluntarily [bought] a defendant's product to pursue a UCL action in the public interest,"" see id. at 818 n.11."
696,10," Defendant does not argue plaintiff's allegations are insufficient under the ""unlawful"" prong of the UCL, (see Reply at 13 n.8), 
and plaintiff has not alleged a violation of the UCL under the ""fraudulent"" prong, (see FAC P 50). "
706,1," The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege a class period extending from at least January 1, 1996 through at least December 31, 
2006. IP-CAC P 1."
706,2, The indirect purchaser plaintiffs' consolidated amended complaint contains similar allegations. 
707,3," As discussed infra, the Court agrees with defendants that the complaint as currently plead does not contain sufficient 
allegations specific to each defendant. "
710,4," Some defendants were not named in the initial complaint, and thus the limitations period for those defendants is different. "
711,5," In addition, the State of California has filed an amicus brief arguing that plaintiffs in a component-cost pass-on case such as the 
instant one have standing under California law to pursue their claims under California's Cartwright Act. The California Attorney 
General also argues that even if the Court applied the AGC factors, plaintiffs have would have standing in such a case. "
712,6," Judge Hamilton noted that her ruling ""is not without controversy or uncertainty, given the state of the law on the issues raised 
herein with respect to antitrust injury."" DRAM II, 536 F. Supp. 2d at 1142. By order filed June 26, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals granted the indirect plaintiffs permission to appeal Judge Hamilton's order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)."
712,7," Twelve of those states at issue in GPU are also at issue here: Arizona, California, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, 
Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin. In addition, GPU involved Tennessee and the District of 
Columbia. Judge Alsup did not evaluate New York, North Carolina, and North Dakota. "
716,8," Plaintiffs state that they inadvertently failed to identify the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act as the basis of their state law 
claim, and that they will amend to correct this error. "
717,9," The Court notes that because the consolidated amended complaint does not include any named plaintiffs from Pennsylvania, 
the parties' discussion of business entities' standing is largely hypothetical. "
720,10," These jurisdictions are Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Kansas,  [**58] Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."
720,11," These states are Arizona, Hawaii, Nebraska, and North Carolina."
720,12," Plaintiffs concede that fraudulent concealment does not exist under the laws of Puerto Rico, and thus any claims under Puerto 
Rico law are limited to the statute of limitations period. "
724,1, First DataBank is not a party to this action.
724,2," McKesson also contends that plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims under the federal antitrust laws because they did not 
directly purchase the Marked Up Drugs. As such, they contend that their federal antitrust claims are foreclosed by the direct 
purchaser rule set forth in Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Plaintiffs counter by 
arguing that the Illinois Brick rule does not apply here because the Plaintiffs are the only ones hurt by the overcharges. See 
Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 215 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding that an indirect purchaser has standing under the co-
conspirator exception to the direct purchaser rule because he or she ""is the  [**3] only party who has paid any overcharges""). 
Since this presents a thorny issue of statutory jurisdiction, see California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 102-03, 109 S. Ct. 
1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989) (direct purchaser rule is matter of statutory construction), the court will bypass the issue since, as 
set forth below, ""the outcome on the merits is foreordained."" See Royal Siam Corp. v. Chertoff, 484 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 2007) 
(permitting bypassing of thorny issues of statutory jurisdiction where ""precedent clearly adumbrates the result on the merits."") 
(citations omitted). "
729,1," Unless otherwise indicated, citations to ""Compl."" are to the second amended complaint. "
730,2," In support of their opposition to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs refer to exhibits and by separate motion seek to convert Bard's 
motion to dismiss to a motion for partial summary judgment. This motion to convert will be denied. "
731,3," Courts have not applied the continuing violation theory to Clayton Act claims. See Midwestern Mach. Co. v. Northwest 
Airlines, Inc., 392 F.3d 265, 270 (8th Cir. 2004) (noting that theory has been applied claims under §§ 1 and 2 of Sherman Act, 
but not to Clayton Act claims)."
731,4," As noted above, see note 3, the allegations in Count III are not subject to the continuing violation  [*13] exception. "
732,5," The Court notes that the significance of the January 1, 1999, date is not explained anywhere  [*14] in the second amended 
complaint. "
733,1," This motion supersedes a Motion to Dismiss (# 7) directed at the original Complaint, and the Court denies that earlier motion as 
moot. "
734,2," Under Colorado law, an Alford plea is one in which the defendant ""consent[s] to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he 
is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime."" People v. Schneider, 25 P.3d 755, 759 (Colo. 
2001). An Alford plea ""the functional equivalent of a guilty plea."" Id."
734,3, The Court assumes that all of the tort claims are asserted to arise under Colorado law. 
736,4," The Court also has doubts that ""in and around the Vail Valley"" is sufficient to plead the relevant geographic market, as it does 
not purport to explain why shuttle services (or other transportation services) operating in adjacent areas could not practicably 
compete in the Vail Valley. "
737,5," In addition, the Court would find that the Amended Complaint does not adequately allege an agreement to monopolize. The 
only Amended Complaint alleges conclusorily that Defendant Frampton ""conspired to monopolize the shuttle service,"" Docket # 
35, P 31, but does not allege whom Defendant Frampton is alleged to have conspired with. The only express allegation of 
Defendant Frampton conspiring with another person relates to after-the-fact events in which Defendant Frampton ""conspired 
with his business partners and employees by instructing them to fraudulently conceal from [the Plaintiff] and everybody else how 
they had illegally ruined [the Plaintiff's] business and  [*16] reputation."" Id. at P 28. These averments are insufficient to establish 
the first element of a conspiracy to monopolize claim. "
738,6," Admittedly, Noerr-Pennington immunity does not encompass fraudulent or illegal actions. Tal, 453 F.3d at 1260. Arguably, the 
intrusion into the Plaintiff's home to gather the information that was later submitted to the police could be said to be an illegal act. 
Nevertheless, it is not the entering of the Plaintiff's home that caused the anticompetitive injury,  [*20] but rather, the Plaintiff's 
incarceration on charges that were admitted by him to be substantiated. Thus, the fraud/illegality exception to Noerr-Pennington 
would not apply here. "
742,1," The second time Avaya amended its complaint, it added Scott Graham, Douglas Graham, and Bruce Shelby as defendants."
742,2," In October 1996, American Telephone and Telegraph Company (""AT&T"") spun off various telecommunication business units to 
form Lucent Technologies, Inc. (""Lucent""). (Counterclaims P 40.) On September 2000, Lucent spun off its ""enterprise network 
group"" to form Avaya. (Counterclaims P 1, 55.) "
743,3," It appears that Avaya refers to ISPs as ""unauthorized service providers."" (Counterclaims P 280; Avaya's Br. at 8.) The Court 
uses the terms interchangeably."
743,4," According to the Counterclaimants, Definity systems ""contain two types of software - the operating systems software and the 
telephony application software."" (Counterclaims P 126.) The operating systems software ""perform[s] basic systems tasks such 
as controlling and allocating memory, managing the sharing of resources and files of a system, and providing a platform for other 
software applications."" (Id. P 127.) ""[T]he telephony application software, which is loaded on to the main server of a Definity 
system, is designed generally to provide all of the functions and features of the phone system purchased by the customer."" (Id. P 
129.) "
744,5," Counterclaimants allege that no other manufacturer of PBX systems blocks access to an owner's ability to perform 
maintenance functions using the software on the purchased system. (Id. P 168.) "
748,6," ""[A] third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards"" is the ""quick look"" rule of reason. 
Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 461 n.6 (3d Cir. 1998).  [*24] This method ""applies in cases where per se 
condemnation is inappropriate but where no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character 
of an inherently suspect restraint."" Gordon, 423 F.3d at 209-210 (citing Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669). Under the ""quick look"" 
method, ""the competitive harm is presumed and the defendant must set forth some competitive justification for the restraints."" Id. 
at 210. ""[T]he quick look approach may be applied only when an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics 
could conclude that the arrangement in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Id. "
749,7, Counterclaimants do not dispute this.
749,8," ""Information costs are barriers that prevent primary market consumers from evaluating the lifecycle costs of a product."" 
Harrison Aire, Inc., 423 F.3d at 382. Switching costs inhibit movement to another product in the primary market and serve to 
""lock in"" the aftermarket customers. Id. at 383. "
750,9," Whether the Court analyzes Avaya's ""relevant market"" argument under the rubric of market power or relevant market makes 
little  [*32] difference. As the Kodak Court stated: ""Because market power is often inferred from market share, market definition 
generally determines the result of the case. Kodak chose to focus on market power directly rather than arguing that the 
relationship between equipment and service and parts is such that the three should be included in the same market definition. 
Whether considered in the conceptual category of 'market definition' or 'market power,' the ultimate inquiry is the same - whether 
competition in the equipment market will significantly restrain power in the service and parts markets."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 469 
n.15 (citations omitted). Indeed the Third Circuit has dealt with Kodak under both conceptual categories. Compare Brokerage 
Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 515 (3d Cir. 1998) (granting summary judgment where plaintiff could not 
establish that the aftermarket was a relevant market); Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d 430 (granting a motion to dismiss for failure to 
plead a plausible relevant market), with Harrison Aire, 423 F.3d at 381-85 (applying Kodak in a market power context)."
750,10," Avaya mistakenly claims that ""Counterclaimants have expressly alleged only one relevant antitrust product market for the 
purpose of all of their antitrust claims."" (Avaya's Br. at 9.) As discussed above, Avaya alleges that one relevant market applies to 
its PBX-related antitrust counterclaims (Counterclaims P 296), while a different relevant market applies to its PDS-related 
antitrust counterclaim (Id. P 342.) "
751,11," Avaya may also be reading Kodak too narrowly in contending that it only applies to a situation  [*36] in which a manufacturer 
has changed a policy relating to the aftermarket. See Harrison Aire, 423 F.3d at 384 (""an 'aftermarket policy change' is not the 
sine qua non of a Kodak claim""). The Court need not reach this issue because Counterclaimants allege such a change in policy."
751,12," Avaya argues that because ""unauthorized service providers cannot provide maintenance at all . . . then the 'other 
anticompetitive conduct'""  [*40] referenced by Counterclaimants ""could not have excluded them"" because ""they were already 
excluded by the denial of access to the proprietary maintenance software."" (Avaya's Reply Br. at 7.) "
752,13," Avaya's citation, in the same footnote, to United Asset Coverage, Inc. v. Avaya, Inc., 409 F. Supp. 2d 1008 (N.D. Ill. 2006) is 
unhelpful here, because in that case, the court conducted  [*42] an evidentiary hearing prior to ruling on the pending motion for a 
preliminary injunction. (Avaya's Reply Br. at 8 n. 9.) Here, on the other hand, the Court must assume the facts alleged in the 
Counterclaims are true. "
753,14, The first of these arguments was rejected above.
753,15," Additionally, to the extent the counterclaims allege a ""shared monopoly"" or ""joint monopoly,"" the counterclaim is questionable 
at best. See Santana Products, Inc. v. Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 249 F. Supp. 2d 463, 519-520 (M.D. Pa. 2003) (""a

756,17," As discussed above, Counterclaimants allege a conspiracy by way of the Avaya One contract and the Sales Engagement 
Principles agreement. Thus, Avaya is incorrect in stating that no particular communications or meetings are alleged. (Avaya's Br. 
at 40.)"
756,18," Avaya has cited no authority to the contrary. Moreover, Avaya presumably knows who its BusinessPartners are, as it has 
entered into an ""Avaya One"" contract with each of them."
756,19," In the final footnote in Avaya's moving brief, (Avaya's Br. at 41 n.38), Avaya states that ""a non-participating competitor typically 
does not have standing to challenge"" an agreement to allocate customers  [*58] or territories or an agreement to take steps 
designed to eliminate competition. But in its reply brief, Avaya clarifies that it is not arguing at this time that the Counterclaimants 
lack standing to assert their Section 1 counterclaim. (Avaya's Reply Br. at 16 n.23.) Therefore, the Court need not address the 
standing issue. "
759,1," Parties sought transfer because this Court was already ""presiding over a pending case, Avaya Inc. v. Telecom Labs, Inc., 06-
cv-2490 (GEB), that involves claims against Avaya that arise out  [*2] of the same set of facts and events. Among other things, 
the Telecom Labs case involves Counterclaims, including those under the federal antitrust laws, that are nearly identical to the 
Complaint in the Black Box case."" (Letter from Robert T. Egan, Jan. 9, 2008, Docket No. 6 at 1.)"
759,2," In October 1996, American Telephone and Telegraph Company (""AT&T"") spun off various telecommunication business units to 
form Lucent Technologies, Inc. (""Lucent""). (Compl. P 39) On September 2000, Lucent spun off its ""enterprise network group"" to 
form Avaya. (Compl. PP 2, 50.) "
760,3," It appears that Avaya refers to ISPs as ""unauthorized service providers."" (Compl. P 257; Avaya's Br. at 8.) The Court uses the 
terms interchangeably."
760,4," According to the Complaint, Definity systems ""contain two types of software - the operating systems software and the telephony 
application software."" (Compl. P 116.) The operating systems software ""perform[s] basic systems tasks such as controlling and 
allocating memory, managing the sharing of resources and files of a system, and providing a platform for other software 
applications."" (Id. P 117.) ""[T]he telephony application software, which is loaded onto the main server of a Definity system, is 
designed generally to provide all of the functions and features of the phone system purchased by the customer."" (Id. P 119.) "
762,5," Black Box has not defined ""T&M maintenance."" "
764,6," ""[A] third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards"" is the ""quick look"" rule of reason. 
Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 461 n.6 (3d Cir. 1998). This method ""applies in cases where per se 
condemnation is inappropriate but where no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the  [*22] anticompetitive 
character of an inherently suspect restraint."" Gordon, 423 F.3d at 209-210 (citing Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669). Under the ""quick 
look"" method, ""the competitive harm is presumed and the defendant must set forth some competitive justification for the 
restraints."" Id. at 210. ""[T]he quick look approach may be applied only when an observer with even a rudimentary understanding 
of economics could conclude that the arrangement in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" 
Id. "
765,7, Black Box does not dispute this. 
766,8," Notably, the parties appear to treat service and maintenance on ""Definity"" systems and service and maintenance on ""ECG 
platform equipment"" as substitutable products. Avaya does not contest the relevant market should be limited to Definity systems 
as it is in the TLI case."
766,9," ""Information costs are barriers that prevent primary market consumers from evaluating the lifecycle costs of a product."" 
Harrison Aire, Inc., 423 F.3d at 382. Switching costs inhibit movement to another product in the primary market and serve to 
""lock in"" the aftermarket customers. Id. at 383. "
767,10," Whether the Court analyzes  [*30] Avaya's ""relevant market"" argument under the rubric of market power or relevant market 
makes little difference. As the Kodak Court stated: ""Because market power is often inferred from market share, market definition

Complaint are true."
769,14, The first of these arguments was rejected above. 
770,15," At this time, the Court declines to address Avaya's other arguments in support of dismissal of this claim. "
771,16," Additionally, to the extent the counterclaims allege a ""shared monopoly"" or ""joint monopoly,"" the counterclaim is questionable 
at best. See Santana Products, Inc. v. Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 249 F. Supp. 2d 463, 519-520 (M.D. Pa. 2003)  [*47] (""a

772,17," As discussed above, Black Box alleges a conspiracy by way of the ""Avaya One"" contract and the Sales Engagement 
Principles agreement. Thus, Avaya is incorrect in stating that no particular communications or meetings are alleged. (Avaya's Br. 
at 38.)"
772,18," Avaya has cited no authority to the contrary. Moreover, Avaya presumably knows who its BusinessPartners are, as it has

does not have standing to challenge"" an agreement to allocate customers or territories or an agreement to take steps designed 
to eliminate competition. Avaya again states in its reply brief that there are no allegations regarding injury to Black Box. 
However, as the Court stated above, Black Box alleges that co-conspirators entered agreements which restricted Black Box's 
ability to obtain the necessary logins from either Avaya or the BusinessPartners. In any event, the Court determines that it is 
inappropriate to address antitrust injury at this early stage of the litigation, especially in light of the relatively scant briefing on the 
issue. See Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp., 64 F.3d 869, 876 (3d Cir. 1995) (""the existence of an 'antitrust injury' is not typically 
resolved through motions to dismiss""). "

780,4," Because Counts V-VII are dismissed on other grounds, the Court will not address the issue of whether the plaintiffs have 
standing to assert the section 2 claims pertaining to insurance services. "
781,5," For purposes of ruling on the motions to dismiss, the Court will assume, without deciding, that all claims relate back to the 
second amended complaint as to the defendants first named in that complaint and back to the original complaint as to Baptist 
Health. No argument is made that the claims against defendants other than Baptist Health relate back to the original complaint 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C). "
785,6," As noted above, Baptist Health is not named in Count VII. "
791,7," The plaintiffs' argument on this point is also inconsistent with their  [**49] (so far successful) argument in state court that Baptist 
Health's economic credentialing policy constitutes tortious interference with the doctor-patient relationship. See Baptist Health v. 
Murphy, 365 Ark. at 123-25, 226 S.W.3d at 807-08. "
793,8," The use of the phrase ""such as,"" indicates that there are surrounding cities other than Conway and Searcy in which hospitals 
that admit cardiology patients are located. In light of the allegations in paragraph 49, presumably these cities would include Pine 
Bluff and Hot Springs. "
800,1," Defendants  [**4] are Tyco International, Ltd., Tyco International (U.S.), Inc., Tyco Healthcare Group, L.P. (now Covidien), and 
The Kendall Healthcare Products Company (collectively, ""Tyco"")."
800,2," Plaintiffs propose to certify a class comprising: All persons who purchased Sharps Containers in the United States directly from Tyco at any time during the period October 
4, 2001 through the present (and continuing until the effects of Tyco's anticompetitive conduct alleged herein cease) (the 
""Class Period""). The Class excludes Tyco, Tyco's parents, subsidiaries and affiliates. (Compl. P 16). "
817,1," In a declaration filed after his deposition, Abu Issa contradicts his deposition testimony, stating that Roots did not participate in 
the negotiation of the written agreement and only allowed Gabana to serve as intermediary on the condition that the written 
agreement not modify or extinguish any rights awarded orally by Gap. See Abu Issa Decl. PP 9, 12. The Court can only 
conclude that Abu Issa's deposition - which flatly contradicts his earlier testimony - is a ""sham."" See Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. 
Co., 952 F.2d 262, 267 (9th Cir. 1991).  [*18] Abu Issa's earlier testimony was consistent with Roots' original legal theory that 
Roots was involved in the negotiation of the 2003 written contract and that its ISP rights were derivative of the rights established 
by the written agreement. See,e.g., Second Amended Complaint PP 28, 45. Only when the Court granted Gap's first and second 
motions to dismiss on the basis of the parol evidence rule did Abu Issa suggest that parol evidence could not be applied 
because Roots played no part in the negotiation of the written agreement. "
823,1," The Association is the plaintiff, Country Point at Dix Hills Home Owners Association, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation. "
827,2," The Beechwood defendants are the Beechwood Carmen Building Corp., Country Pointe's sponsor, and the Beechwood 
Organization, whom the plaintiff alleges is an alter-ego of the sponsor. "
845,1," The Association is the plaintiff, Country Point at Dix Hills Home Owners Association, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation. "
846,2," The court notes that, although the seventh cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and the fifteenth cause of action for a 
declaratory Judgment are asserted against the moving defendants, they make no arguments for dismissal thereof. In addition, 
the same causes of action that are asserted against the moving defendants are also asserted against the defendant Beechwood 
Organization. The Beechwood Organization, however, does not join in the present motion. Since it is improvident for the court to 
search the record sua sponte on a motion to dismiss (see, Barry & Sons, Inc. v. Instinct Prods. LLC, 5 Misc 3d 172, 179, 783 
N.Y.S.2d 225; see also, West Washington Cut Meat Ctr. v. Solomon, 260 AD 741, 742, 24 N.Y.S.2d 209), the court will not 
address either dismissal of the seventh and fifteenth causes of action or dismissal of the complaint insofar as it is asserted 
against the Beechwood Organization. "

856,3," OEMs typically resort to the spot market when their needs for DRAM exceed the quantities negotiated or available under the 
terms of their contracts with defendants, or in the event spot market prices were to fall substantially below contract prices. TAC P 
87. Similarly, when OEMs purchase or acquire greater quantities of DRAM through contract purchases than are anticipated or 
needed for equipment production requirements, OEMs will sell their excess inventories into the spot market. Id."
856,4," Presumably, the distributors might also re-sell DRAM modules to other distributors, in addition to OEMs and end-users. "
857,5," Since the filing of the instant action, notices of voluntary dismissal have been filed by plaintiff States Ohio, New Hampshire, 
Texas, Alaska, Delaware, and Vermont. "
858,6," The third amended complaint originally pled the County of Sandoval as the only additional class  [*20] representative for New 
Mexico's government entity class. See TAC at P 176. Defendants moved to strike the County of Sandoval as class 
representative, however, and the court granted defendants' request on the record at the April 9 hearing that was held in 
connection with the instant motion. The court allowed plaintiffs additional time in which to proffer a new class representative, and 
on April 23, 2008, plaintiffs identified Rio Rancho Public Schools as the substitute representative. On August 13, 2008, the court 
furthermore granted plaintiffs' request to submit the Declaration of Randall C. Evans in support of New Mexico's request for 
certification of a government entity class. Accordingly, and for purposes of the instant motion and order herein, the court treats 
Rio Rancho Public Schools as the designated additional class representative for the State of New Mexico's proposed 
government entity class."
858,7," With respect to the motions to seal, defendants request to file under  [*22] seal excerpts from the testimony of both Dr. Kenneth 
Flamm and Ms. Guerin-Calvert, as well as selected portions of their opposition brief. Plaintiffs have also filed a request to seal 
excerpts of Dr. Flamm's and Ms. Guerin-Calvert's testimony, as well as certain excerpts from the deposition of Dr. Johann 
Harter. Third party Dell furthermore supports the requests as to certain information provided by Dell. The court hereby DENIES 
the requests to seal, however, as it finds that an insufficient showing has been made by the parties as to the need for sealing. As 
for the parties' requests for judicial notice, the court hereby GRANTS them. Defendants seek judicial notice of various orders 
issued in several out-of-circuit and unrelated cases, and plaintiffs seek judicial notice of certain report excerpts issued by the 
U.S. Census Bureau. The court finds that both parties have made a sufficient showing pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 
201. "
860,8," Both classes also appear to plead violations of their states' respective consumer protection statutes. See TAC at PP 231-33, 
313-14. Plaintiffs' motion, however, analyzes the propriety of class  [*28] certification vis-a-vis the antitrust claims only. Thus, this 
court does the same, and the instant analysis is limited to the question of certification in connection with the proposed classes' 
antitrust claims only."
860,9," The parties' more particularized focus on the impact element makes sense, in view of the fact that predominance is frequently 
satisfied as to the antitrust violation factor in cases alleging price-fixing conspiracies, and the standard for showing 
predominance as to damages is arguably less than that for impact. See, e.g., In re Bulk [Extruded] Graphite Prod. Antitrust Litig., 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16619, 2006 WL 891362 at *9 (whether a conspiracy exists is a common question that predominates over 
other issues in the case and ""has the effect of satisfying the first prerequisite of FRCP 23(b)(3)""); In re Rubber Chem. Antitrust 
Litig., 232 F.R.D. at 354 (at certification stage of an antitrust  [*29] class action, plaintiffs have ""a limited burden with respect to 
showing that individual damages issues"" do not predominate); In re Potash Antitrust Litig., 159 F.R.D. at 697 (plaintiffs need not 
supply a ""precise damage formula,"" but must simply offer a proposed method for determining damages that is not ""so 
insubstantial as to amount to no method at all""). "
868,1," Three thousand imprints were for the Chardonnay; the remaining 1,500 were for the Sauvignon Blanc. See Garcia Decl., Ex. 
12. The term ""shells"" refers to masters -- i.e., labels without any information about the particular varietal. See Garcia Depo. at 
147. "
870,2," To the extent Defendants argue that a person's involvement in an industry alone can establish chargeable knowledge, the 
Court does not agree. A person's involvement in an industry is a factor to consider and may at times be a significant factor, but 
alone it is not enough to establish chargeable  [*19] knowledge. The nature and breadth of the infringement must also be 
considered. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Cameron, 482 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1148 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (in case in which plaintiff claimed "
871,," infringement based on the Terminator movies, noting that the movies ""have been exceedingly popular both domestically and 
abroad"")."
871,3," See, e.g., Parsons v. Tickner, 31 Cal. App. 4th 1513, 1525, 37 Cal. Rptr. 2d 810 (1995) (""The rule is that the plaintiff must 
plead and prove the facts showing: (a) Lack of knowledge. (b) Lack of means of obtaining knowledge (in the exercise of 
reasonable diligence the facts could not have been discovered at an earlier date). (c) How and when [s]he did actually discover 
the fraud or mistake. Under this rule constructive and presumed notice or knowledge are equivalent to knowledge.""). "
873,4," The common law unfair competition claim is essentially the same as the common law misappropriation claim. See FAC 58 (""By 
appropriating Plaintiff's 'SONOMA RIDGE' brand name for their own proprietary wines, Defendants David Coleman and 
Amerivine have engaged in unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business acts or practices""). As noted above, it appears that the 
common law misappropriation claim is subject to a two-year statute of limitations."
873,5," At the hearing, Mr. Garcia explained that the conversion claim is based on the alleged theft of the wine labels (i.e., tangible 
property) that Defendants used. In contrast, the misappropriation claim is based on the alleged misappropriation of the Sonoma 
Ridge brand name (i.e., intangible property). Given Mr. Garcia's comments at the hearing, the Court understands Mr. Garcia to 
have given up any claim for misappropriation based on misappropriation of tangible property. See FAC P 43 (claiming 
misappropriation of not only the Sonoma Ridge brand name but also the master printing plates). "
874,6," There is a broader discovery rule when there is a theft of ""any article of historical, interpretive, scientific, or artistic significance."" 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 383(c) (""An action for taking, detaining, or injuring any goods or chattels, including actions for the specific 
recovery of personal property. The cause of action in the case of theft, as defined in Section 484 of the Penal Code, of any 
article of historical, interpretive, scientific, or artistic significance is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery of the 
whereabouts of the article by the aggrieved party, his or her agent, or the law enforcement agency that originally investigated the 
theft.""). There is no allegation that any such article is at issue in the instant case."
874,7," Fraudulent concealment can also be a basis for equitable tolling. See, e.g., Bernson, 7 Cal. 4th at 931 (1994) (noting that 
fraudulent concealment is a well-established ground for equitable tolling). "
875,8," To the extent Mr. Garcia alleges a civil conspiracy claim based on copyright infringement, that claim is preempted. See RDF 
Media Ltd. v. Fox Broad. Co., 372 F. Supp. 2d 556, 565-66 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (indicating that unfair competition and  [*37] civil 
conspiracy claims based on copyright infringement were preempted because they did not contain extra elements beyond the 
basic elements of copyright and did not protect rights qualitatively different from those protected by copyright); Idema v. 
Dreamworks , Inc., 162 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1193-94 (C.D. Cal. 2001) (noting that ""Plaintiffs' Eleventh Claim for Relief, for Civil 
Conspiracy, is largely just a restatement of Plaintiffs' prior (FAC) 'conspiracy to infringe copyright' claim, which was already 
dismissed with prejudice by this Court""; then concluding that ""[t]he Eleventh Claim for Relief is clearly preempted . . . to the 
extent it attempts to seek liability under this alternate theory for the same conduct challenged under copyright""). "
876,9," Given the correspondence between Mr. Garcia's counsel and the U.S. Copyright Office, there should be no dispute that the 
only work that is copyrighted is the Sonoma Ridge photograph itself. See Arnone Decl., Exs. E-G. "
877,10," Defendants also contend that Mr. Garcia cannot bring such a trademark infringement claim because he abandoned the brand 
name, and now Allied, and not he, owns the trademark for the name. See Mot. at 15. The Court need not address this argument 
for the reasons discussed below. "
878,11," Defendants do not appear to be making any preemption argument here -- i.e., an argument that the misappropriation claim is 
preempted by trademark law. To the extent that Defendants are, that argument would not have much merit. See Golden Door, 
Inc. v. Odisho, 646 F.2d 347, 352 (9th Cir. 1980) (indicating that there is no preemption by the Lanham Act so long as the state 
law does not conflict with the federal law; also indicating that there is no conflict where state law, like the Lanham Act, ""protects

887,1," St. Tammany Pearl River Salvage was terminated from the case on October 30, 2006. (R. Doc. 86)."
887,2," Plaintiffs' latest memorandum suggests they made claims under the Sherman Act as well as state  [*4] antitrust statutes. 
Plaintiffs did not make these claims in any of their complaints, and thus the Court will not consider them. "
890,3," The vessel owners who carried insurance and whose insurers voluntarily paid the prices they freely negotiated with Resolve 
and the other salvors would have incurred no damages from the alleged conspiracy. "
891,4," In his affidavit, Augustus Bazin states that he had to scale a wall to access his vessel in the Orleans Marina. As such, he may 
have been ""denied"" access to his vessel. Still, Bazin does not state that his vessel needed to be salvaged or that he had any 
dealings with Marine Recovery or Resolve. "
892,5," Defendants dispute that Lambert was denied access to his vessel, since Lambert testified in his deposition that he went to the 
marina quite often after the storm. He stated that although the main gates were closed, he was able to get into the marina by 
climbing over a walk-through gate. (R. Doc. 140-4 at 27)."
892,6," Scott testified that he could not enter the marina during the month of September, 2005, because  [*22] the National Guard 
would not let him enter the city. (R. Doc. 122-1 at 28-29). "
893,7," Additionally, Lovelock's testimony that Horizon was ready to salvage his boat is contrary to plaintiffs' claim of a conspiracy to 
keep out all salvors but Resolve and St. Tammany Pearl River. "
902,*," Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by 
designation. "
934,1," It is unclear how much weight the majority  [**122] places on the lack of any explicit price or output restrictions, see Maj. Op. at 
55-61 (Parts II.C.1-2), or whether it ultimately relies on the distinctions it draws between this case and Broadcast Music, Inc. v. 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979), and NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 
U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984), see Maj. Op. at 61-85 (Parts II.C.3-4), in reaching its conclusion that the rule of 
reason should apply."
934,2," As noted by the majority, there are a few limited exceptions to the exclusivity agreement, including, for example, allowing Clubs 
to license their own trademarks on hot dogs and similar items sold within their home broadcasting territory. See Maj. Op. at 11-
12. Notwithstanding these narrow exceptions, nearly all retail products containing the intellectual property of Major League 
Baseball or the Clubs must be licensed through MLBP. "
935,3," The majority also implies that MLBP's choice to set a royalty rate rather than a uniform price or ""sum certain"" is somehow less 
problematic for antitrust purposes, believing that MLBP's licensing fees are ""entirely responsive to the preferences of licensees 
and retail product consumers."" Maj. Op. at 72-74. Such a distinction between royalty rates and uniform prices is meaningless. 
First, for purposes of the Sherman Act, prices ""are fixed because they are agreed upon,"" whether it be in the form of a uniform 
price or a price set by formula. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. at 222. Competitors who agree to fix royalty rates, no less than 
competitors who agree to fix a single uniform price, violate the Sherman Act. MLBP's expert does not even contest that it has 
 [**125] fixed a single price in this case. See Fisher Report P 29-30 (""MLBP has chosen to set a single price (or royalty rate) 
irrespective of the popularity of a Club . . . .""). Second, whether or not an agreed upon price is responsive to consumer demand 
is irrelevant. See Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. at 222-23 (""[T]he fact that, as here, [prices] are fixed at the fair going market 
price is immaterial. For purchases at or under the market are one species of price-fixing.""). The antitrust laws seek to ensure that 
the determination of price is by free competition alone; the reasonableness of an agreed upon price is not a defense. See id. at 
223; Catalano, Inc., 446 U.S. at 647. Furthermore, the majority incorrectly believes that the licensing fees are ""entirely responsive"" to demand. A simple example 
displays the majority's fallacy. Take Club C, a Club that has two fans A and B. A is willing to pay $ 15 for a Club C hat while B is 
willing to pay $ 12 for the same hat. Assume that Producer P will sell Club C hats at its marginal cost to produce them of $ 10 
and assume that MLBP charges a 20% license fee. Under this scenario, the price for a licensed hat would be $ 12.50 (price = $ 
10 /(1 -  [**126] 0.20)), and only A would be willing to buy a Club C hat. However, if Club C was pricing its own licenses, it could 
drop the license fee to 15%, in which case both A and B would be willing to buy Club C hats for $ 11.76, and licensing revenue 
for Club C would increase from $ 2.50 to $ 3.52. As this example shows, the licensing fees here are not totally responsive to 
consumer demand. Basic principles of economics teach us that as royalty rates increase, the price for licensed goods will 
increase, and output will decline as fewer consumers are willing to purchase licensed goods at higher prices. This is Salvino's 
central contention--that if the Clubs were forced to compete with each other for licensing fees, they would offer licenses at lower 
rates, thereby resulting in lower prices (and increased output) for licensed goods. "
936,4," MLBP further argues that eliminating price competition between the Clubs causes no harm to the market because the Clubs 
must compete with a wide array of entertainment entities, including other sports leagues and entertainment companies, in the 
licensing of intellectual property, and therefore lack the market power necessary to affect prices."
936,5," For a detailed explanation of the per se, quick look, and rule of reason methods of analysis under the Sherman Act, see Part 
II.B of the majority opinion. See Maj.  [**130] Op. at 48-54. "
937,6," The doctrine of ancillary restraints has its roots in an 1898 opinion by then-Judge Taft. See United States v. Addyston Pipe & 
Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 280-83 (6th Cir. 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 (1899). The principle has been 
adapted over the last  [**136] few decades to the context of joint ventures, as noted in the cases cited above."
937,7," However, a non-ancillary restraint is not necessarily unlawful or evaluated under a per se rule; rather, it is simply evaluated 
independent of the joint venture because its competitive effects are irrelevant to the joint venture and vice versa. Conversely, an 
ancillary restraint is not necessarily lawful. Its competitive benefits and harms must still be weighed, as part of the joint venture, 
under a rule-of-reason analysis. See Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1102 (1st Cir. 1994). "
938,8," Several courts and commentators have--I believe correctly--viewed Broadcast Music and NCAA, the two cases primarily relied 
upon by the majority, as implicit applications of the ancillary restraints analysis. See, e.g., Sullivan, 34 F.3d at 1102; Polk Bros., 
776 F.2d at 189; see also XI Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law PP 1908b, 1908d, 1908e, at 253-58, 261-65 (2d ed. 2005). In 
Broadcast Music, the need to reach some pricing agreement was necessary in order to sell a blanket license; otherwise, the 
product would not have been possible at all. See 441 U.S. at 20-23. Consequently, the Court examined the venture  [**137] as a 
whole, implicitly viewing the pricing restraint as ancillary. In contrast, the Court reviewed the television agreement in NCAA as a 
non-ancillary naked restraint, apart from the rest of the joint venture, because the Court could not find any reason for the 
agreement that would be reasonably necessary to achieve any of the efficiency-enhancing objectives of the NCAA. See 468 
U.S. at 113-15; see also Texaco Inc., 547 U.S. at 7 (citing NCAA as an application of the ancillary restraints doctrine)."
938,9," Salvino argues that ""there are  [**139] better ways to address"" the externalities than these two challenged provisions. Whether 
the externalities could be eliminated in a substantially less restrictive manner is an inquiry that should generally be part of a rule-
of-reason analysis rather than part of a per se or quick-look approach. See, e.g., Care Heating & Cooling, Inc. v. Am. Standard, 
Inc., 427 F.3d 1008, 1012 (6th Cir. 2005)."
938,10," Empirical analysis could ultimately show that the anticompetitive harms from the challenged provisions outweigh any 
procompetitive benefits. The point is simply that Salvino's expert recognized that empirical analysis is necessary to determine 
whether these provisions have a positive or negative competitive effect. When empirical analysis is required to determine a 
challenged restraint's net competitive effect, neither a per se nor a quick-look approach is appropriate because those methods of 
analysis are reserved for practices that ""facially appear[] to be one[s] that would always or almost always tend to restrict 
competition and decrease output."" Broad. Music, 441 U.S. at 19-20; see also Texaco Inc., 547 U.S. at 7 n.3 (explaining that a 
quick-look analysis applies only where ""business activities  [**140] are so plainly anticompetitive that courts need undertake only 
a cursory examination before imposing antitrust liability"")."
938,11," Salvino argues that the exclusivity and profit-sharing provisions are not essential to the success of MLBP. Even if true--one 
certainly could imagine MLBP prospering without these provisions--the analysis here is not altered. Under the ancillary restraints 
doctrine, a challenged restraint need not be essential, but rather only ""reasonably ancillary to the legitimate cooperative aspects 
of the venture."" Freeman, 322 F.3d at 1151; see also Polk Bros., 776 F.2d at 189 (explaining that a restraint is ancillary if it may 
promote the success of the more extensive cooperation and will then be scrutinized under the rule of reason). "
941,1," The court dismissed all claims against AC Nielsen SA de CV and former ACN-PR manager Roberto Trigos. See Docket No. 
21. The court also previously dismissed PMR's claims against Walgreens alleging tortious interference (Count 6) and a violation 
of Article 4 of Puerto Rico Law 77, P.R. Law Ann. tit. 10, § 260 (Count 9). See id. The court addressed PMR's federal copyright 
and related Puerto Rico law claims against ACN-PR (Counts 1-7) in a separate opinion and order issued on March 28, 2008. 
See Docket No. 118. As noted in the court's opinion and order, the parties dispute whether PMR served ACN with a summons 
and complaint and/or whether ACN waived service of process. See id. n.1. The court reiterates that any party desiring relief with 
respect to this issue shall file a motion with the court."
941,2, The court concludes that oral argument will not assist in resolving the summary judgment motions. 
942,3," The court's orders at Docket Nos. 75 and 105 authorized the parties to temporarily rely upon Spanish-language materials and 
made clear that they still had to comply with the English-language requirement. "
943,4," The parties also refer to PMR's product as ""store test audit service,"" ""shelf incidence report or service,"" ""store incident report,"" 
and ""out of stock tracking service."" To avoid confusion, the court refers to PMR's product as the ""store test/store track service"" 
throughout this opinion and order. "
945,5," At summary judgment, Rodríguez states that he made the August 2002 business decision to limit PMR's access because the 
presence of different enterprises tended to disrupt store activities. He claims that he consulted only Walgreens District Managers 
in reaching his decision. This conflicts with the statement he allegedly made to Cabrero. For summary judgment purposes, the 
court accepts the non-moving party, PMR',s allegation regarding Rodríguez's statement. "
947,6," The court has analyzed PMR's tying claim under Section 1. Assuming PMR also or alternatively brings its tying claim under 
Section 2, the court's analysis applies equally to that claim. "
949,7," The First Circuit distinguishes between vertical and horizontal agreements. A vertical restraint on trade involves a combination 
of persons at different levels of the market structure. M&H Tire Co. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 733 F.2d 973, 978 (1st Cir. 
1984). A horizontal restraint involves an agreement between competitors at the same level of market structure. Id. Horizontal 
restraints typically constitute ""naked restraints of trade with no purpose except stifling competition,"" and, therefore, per se 
Sherman Act violations. Id. (quoting Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 131 (2d Cir. 1978) (en banc). Conversely, 
vertical restrictions may promote competition and, therefore, are examined under the rule of reason. Id. "
952,1," On May 10, 2005, Plaintiff, then represented by Rafael Pio Fonseca, filed a Complaint in which it was alleged:"
952,8," . Beginning on or about September 1, 2004, Defendants began the practice of racial discrimination against Plaintiff which 
consists of the enforcement against Plaintiff of General amendments to the Kings County general plan targeted against 
Plaintiff as an individual African American and designed with the specific intent to prevent Plaintiff from engaging the [sic] 
lawful of [sic] operation of a recycling business on land purchased for that purpose and Plaintiff further alleges that on or 
about February 25, 2005 Defendants continued their discrimination against Plaintiff by selective enforcement against 
Plaintiff as to similar business operations in Armona, California situated in Kings county [sic] under the color of official 
authority. On information and belief Plaintiff further alleges that other individuals similarly situated have not been subjected 
to these practices. The Complaint alleged claims for injunctive and declaratory relief based on the Equal Protection Clause  [*3] of the California 
and United States Constitutions; for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and for violation of 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
961,2," It is well established in the Ninth Circuit that an allegation based on nothing more than a bare averment that the official's 
conduct conformed to official policy, custom or practice suffices to state a Monell claim under Section 1983. See Karim Panahi v. "
962,," L.A. Police Dept., 839 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1988); Shah v. County of L.A., 797 F.2d 743, 747 (9th Cir. 1986); Guillory v. 
County of Orange, 731 F.2d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir. 1984). "
963,3," Although the Local Government Antitrust Act does not bar injunctive or declaratory relief, Thatcher Enterprises v. Cache 
County Corp., 902 F.2d 1472, 1477 (10th Cir.1990), the FAC does not seek injunctive or declaratory relief in connection with the 
Third Cause of Action. "
966,4," Plaintiff does not appear to have lodged a copy of his deposition transcript, as required by Rules 5-133(j) and 56-260(e), Local 
Rules of Practice, and has not attached copies of the excerpts of the transcript to his opposition to the motion for summary 
judgment. Further, evidence that Plaintiff's son and a tenant on Plaintiff's property have been the subject of code inspections by 
 [*54] officials of Kings County is not relevant to establish that Plaintiff was discriminated on the basis of his race by the 
amendment to the General Plan, absent a showing that others similarly situated to Plaintiff's son and tenant were not the subject 
of such code inspections. Plaintiff's evidence that property owned by him in Armona was inspected in late 2004/early 2005 in 
response to multiple public complaints is not relevant to show racial discrimination in the amendment to the General Plan absent 
a showing that no such public complaints were made to the Kings County Planning Agency or that the items listed by the County 
for correction or improvement were actually up to code standards at the time the Armona property was inspected. No such 
evidence is presented. See discussion infra. "
969,5," Defendants move for summary  [*65] judgment in connection with the allegation in the Complaint that ""on or about February 25, 
2005 Defendants continued their discrimination against Plaintiff by selective enforcement against Plaintiff as to similar business 
operations in Armona, California situated in Kings county [sic] under the color of official authority."" Because the FAC contains no 
allegations of discrimination in connection with Plaintiff's business operations in Armona, the motion for summary judgment on 
this ground is moot. Whether evidence of other acts of alleged racial discrimination against Plaintiff or his family members is 
admissible at trial will be the subject of a motion in limine. "
980,1," Unless otherwise indicated, citations to ""Compl."" are to the second amended complaint."
980,2, Bard places the figure at  [*4] less than 30%.
980,3," The Court notes that Plaintiffs cite their second amended complaint as authority for allegations in their memorandum about 
GPOs and Bard's contracts with them. Allegations are not established by citation to other allegations. The ones at issue, 
however, are general descriptions and do not appear to be contested, at least for purposes of the instant motion, by Bard. 
Moreover, Plaintiffs have filed as exhibits copies of two agreements between Bard and GPOs, both of which include provisions 
on sole source and dual source status. (See Pls. Reply Exs. L and M.) "
981,4," There are seven GPOs: Novation, Premier, Consorta, MedAssets, Healthtrust, Broadlane, and AmeriNet. "
982,5," The Court notes that,  [*11] in a different context, Bard has submitted eight affidavits from hospital representatives who attest 
that they directly purchase Bard's urological catheters from a GPO. (Bard Exs. E, P 5; F, P 6; H, P 11; I, P 8; J, P 4; K, P 16; L, P 
15; M P 8.) These hospitals are in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia and total fifteen. It is 
nonsensical to argue that Plaintiffs have not satisfied the numerosity requirement given this sampling of potential class members 
from five states. "
983,6," As stated above, the Hospital cannot continue as a Plaintiff because it is not a class member."
983,7," The deletion of the ""co-conspirator"" exclusion would also resolve Bard's argument that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the 
numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) because  [*15] they have not shown how many direct purchasers of their urological 
catheters through GPO contracts are not co-conspirators."
983,8," As discussed below, the claims of disparagement also fail under Rule 23(b)(3)."
983,9," This adequacy requirement also involves an inquiry into whether the class member's counsel ""will competently and vigorously 
pursue the lawsuit . . . ."" Hervey v. City of Little Rock, 787 F.2d 1223, 1230 (8th Cir. 1986). There is little dispute that class 
counsel satisfy this part of the requirement. "
984,10," Because the Hospital is not a proper named class representative, the Court will henceforth refer only to St. Francis."
984,11," The Court has carefully and thoroughly reviewed the class certification record, including competing experts' lengthy 
declarations; however, the Court will not discuss each and every argument made, but will discuss only those of particular 
relevance."
984,12," For instance, Bard cites the geographical location of the hospital as requiring an individualized assessment of its pricing 
variations. (Its representative, James Bailey, testified that Bard's prices do not vary depending on location. See Reply Ex. D at 
21-22.) According to the evidence now before the Court, St. Francis may prevail, however, only if it can establish that Bard had a 
tiered-pricing structure that was used to further an anti-competitive scheme. Bard also cites a movement away from infection "
985,," control catheters as a reason why a competitor may be losing sales. This explanation goes to the merits of St. Francis' antitrust 
claims and not to the merits of its request for class certification."
985,13," A ""but-for world"" is one that is ""free of the restraints and conduct alleged to be anticompetitive.""  [*22] Blades, 400 F.3d at 
569. This hypothetical world must be constructed by an expert to establish an antitrust impact. Id."
985,14," As discussed above, Bard's expert, Dr. Kaplan, takes issue with the worth of these models. The question now before the 
Court, however, is not the weight to be given the respective experts but wether St. Francis ""has made a threshold showing of 
how [it] intend[s] to prove impact using generalized evidence on a class wide basis."" In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 209 F.R.D. 
at 267-68. "
986,15," Bard's expert, David P. Kaplan, Ph.D., cites purchases through individual contracts or integrated delivery networks (""IDN"") as 
a factor why the formulaic approach of Dr. Singer will not work. The class definitions do not include such purchases."
986,16," Indeed, Drs. Singer and Litan propose no models that address the issue of disparagement. "
996,1," N.Y.G.B.L. § 360-l is the current version of N.Y.G.B.L. § 368-d, which was repealed effective January 1, 1997. "

Oktyabr"" and demarcate any changes from the original document with []."
997,3," The parties dispute the classification of the 2005 Agreement between plaintiff and Rot Front. Plaintiff refers to it as the ""2005 
Licensing Agreement,"" while defendants refer to it as the ""2005 Distributorship Agreement."" Although on its face the 2005 
Agreement is a contract between Rot Front and plaintiff, the Managing Director of United Confectioners attests that Rot Front 
made the agreement on behalf of United Confectioners. Nosenko  [**7] Aff. P 3. "

1002,7," Plaintiff presents no evidence of any differences between the export and domestic versions of the Rot Front or Babayevsky

1003,8," Because the analysis for Section 32 and 43 claims is similar, even if plaintiff had standing to bring a Section 32 claim,

claim. "

1004,10, Plaintiff has not moved for summary judgment on this claim and has not addressed the claim in its briefs. 
1006,11," Defendants stated that candy makes up 70 percent of their total business. Of that percent, only approximately 30 percent 
comes from Russia. Thus, Russian candy  [**38] constitutes only 21 percent of their total business (70% x 30% = 21%). 
Kerzhner Dep. at 27-28. Of this 21 percent, the candy in dispute makes up an even smaller percentage of their total business, as

1027,5," The memorandum in support of the omnibus motion (Dkt. Entry 501) is referred to herein as ""Omnibus Mem. in Supp.""; the 
omnibus memorandum in reply (Dkt. Entry 674) is referred  [*68] to as ""Omnibus Reply Mem."" The memorandum in support of

under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6) (Dkt. Entry 563) (""12(b)(6) Opp'n Mem.""); (2) a memorandum in opposition to dismissal of the

memorandum in opposition to the motions by Thai Airways, Saudi Arabian Airways, and South African Airways (Dkt. Entry 577) 
(""FSIA Opp'n Mem.""). "
1028,6," Separate motions to dismiss by Air Mauritius and Ethiopian were filed, fully briefed, and argued. While the motions were under 
consideration, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss Air Mauritius and Ethiopian Airlines from this action, rendering their 
motions moot. (See Notices of Voluntary Dismissal, Dkt. Entries 769, 770; July 22, 2008 Order by Judge Gleeson (""so-ordering"" 
dismissal).)"
1028,7," During a conference on May 31, 2007, the court offered the plaintiffs the opportunity to replead their complaint in light of 
Twombly. (May 31, 2007 Tr. of Pre-Motion Conference Before The Honorable Viktor Pohorelsky, United States Magistrate 
Judge, Dkt. Entry 785, at 31-32.) That offer was not accepted. "
1031,8," The court finds indistinguishable from the allegations here the conclusory allegations deemed insufficient in In re Elevator 
Antitrust Litig., No. 04 CV 1178, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34517, 2006 WL 1470994, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2006), Kahn v. 
iBiquity Digital Corp., No. 06 Civ. 1536, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89049, 2006 WL 3592366, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006), and 
Klebanow v. New York Produce Exch., 344 F.2d 294, 299 (2d Cir. 1965). "
1033,9," It bears noting that Twombly applies with equal force to the plaintiffs' foreign law claims. The European Union law claims should 
be dismissed for the additional and independent reasons articulated in Section III below. "
1035,10," By contrast, where defendants challenge the factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction, a court is ""not obligated to accord 
presumptive truthfulness to the allegations of the complaint"" and ""may weigh the evidence on the record accompanying the Rule 
12(b)(1) motion, or hold an evidentiary hearing, and decide for itself the merits of the jurisdictional dispute."" Dow Jones, 237 F. 
Supp. 2d at 404; see also Filetech S.A. v. Fr. Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932 (2d Cir. 1998)."
1035,11," As  [*96] noted in Boyd v. AWB Ltd., it may not be entirely precise to term the FTAIA's limitations as a constraint on a court's 
jurisdiction. 544 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Boyd observed that ""the express language of the FTAIA -- i.e., that the 
Sherman Act ""shall not apply"" to certain kinds of foreign conduct -- suggests a limitation, not on a court's power to decide the 
case, but rather, on the substantive applicability of the statute."" Indeed, ""such imprecision has significant consequences."" 
Ayyash v. Bank Al-Madina, No. 04 Civ. 9201, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9677, 2006 WL 587342, at *4 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2006) 
(noting that ""[u]nlike merits challenges, challenges to a court's subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and can be raised 
even after trial has concluded and judgment has been entered,"" and that ""factual disputes as to jurisdictional questions are 
typically resolved by the judge in a pre-trial hearing, not by a jury at trial""). In this case, as in Boyd, none of the parties challenge 
the characterization of the issue as jurisdictional in nature. "
1038,12," The indirect domestic purchaser plaintiffs assert these claims on their own behalf, as well as on behalf of the U.S. Indirect 
Purchaser Class, which includes the U.S. Indirect Purchaser Subclass. (Compl. PP 192, 193, 213-221.) The Complaint identifies 
the individually named U.S. indirect purchaser plaintiffs, and the U.S. indirect purchaser class as ""persons and entities in the 
United States that purchased Airfreight Shipping Services for shipments within, to, or from the United States indirectly from any 
of the Defendants or any predecessor, subsidiary, or affiliate of each, at any time"" during the class period. (Compl. P 192.) The 
U.S. Indirect Purchaser Subclass is comprised of: [A]ll persons and entities (excluding governmental entities, Defendants, and Defendants' respective predecessors, 
subsidiaries, affiliates, and business partners) within the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, 
 [*110] Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and within the District of 
Columbia that purchased Airfreight Shipping Services for shipments within, to or from the United States indirectly from any 
of the Defendants or any predecessor, subsidiary, or affiliate of each, at any time during the period from no later than 
January 1, 2000 to the present. "
1039,13, The exceptions to which this provision refers are not applicable to the instant claims.
1039,14," The version of the ADA in effect when the Court decided Morales used the phrase ""relating to"" in place of the phrase ""related 
to"" (used in the current version). This slight change in terminology, which occurred in 1994, had no substantive effect on the 
provision and does not undercut the precedential value of Morales. See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe, 448 F.3d 66, 75 n. 
11 (1st Cir. 2006), aff'd, 128 S. Ct. 989, 169 L. Ed. 2d 933 (2008). "
1040,15," In Morales, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the enforcement of guidelines on fare advertising, promulgated 
by the National Association of Attorney Generals, through state consumer protection laws, was preempted by the ADA. 504 U.S. 
at 379. After observing that the guidelines required disclosures of restrictions on price, that advertised fares be available in 
sufficient quantity to meet expected demand, and that advertised fares include all taxes and surcharges, Morales found that 
""[o]ne cannot avoid the conclusion that these aspects of the guidelines 'relate to' airline rates."" Id. 387- 88.  [*115] If state actions 
aimed at ""[p]rice advertising surely 'relate[] to' price,"" this court must conclude that the state law claims asserted here aimed at 
price-fixing ""surely relate[] to price."""
1040,16," The plaintiffs advance a number of alternative arguments that also lack merit. First, the plaintiffs attempt to draw a distinction 
between state law claims that concern conspiracies to fix airline prices, and state law claims that concern airline prices, but the 
argument is semantic, and lacks legal support. (See ADA Opp'n Mem. 33-34) (failing to cite a single opinion where a court drew 
such a distinction to exempt claims from preemption). It is defeated by the broad reach of the ADA preemption provision. The plaintiffs also argue that their state law claims avoid preemption because the defendants' conduct is ""outrageous"" and ""too 
tenuously related"" and ""unnecessary to an airlines' [prices]."" (ADA Opp'n Mem. 36-37 (citing Smith v. Comair, Inc., 134 F.3d 254 
(4th Cir. 1998).) Plaintiffs also attempt to argue that, because price-fixing is not ""necessary"" to an air carrier's operations and 
price-setting, then the ADA preemption should not be construed to ""insulate air carriers from liability for injuries"" caused by it. 
The cases cited by plaintiff are inapposite. In Comair, the court found that an airline employee's rude behavior towards a 
customer was  [*117] outrageous and therefore constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress. See 134 F.3d at 260. 
Finding state laws preempted here does not ""insulate[] air carriers for injuries caused by outrageous conduct that goes beyond 
the scope of normal aircraft operations,"" (ADA Opp'n Mem. 36-37), particularly where many causes of action are available under 
federal law. "
1041,17," The  [*119] issue in Abdu-Brisson was whether an age discrimination suit brought by air pilots under New York law was 
preempted by the ADA. The Second Circuit decided that it was not, finding that it would have too attenuated of an impact on air 
carrier prices and services, and was too far removed from the field of air carrier competitiveness and efficiency, to be within the 
scope of ADA preemption. Abdu-Brisson, 128 F.3d at 84-85. The plaintiffs also cite to Sakellaridis v. Polar Air Cargo, Inc., which 
cited Abdu-Brisson as authority for the proposition that ""[a] provision is not ""related to"" prices, routes, or services when the state 
law does not interfere with the purposes of the federal statute."" 104 F. Supp. 2d 160, 163 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). In Sakellaridis, a pre-
Morales decision, Judge Weinstein found that a personal injury claim lawsuit brought under New York law by a worker who fell 
from a scaffold while preparing to work on an aircraft at JFK International Airport was not preempted by the ADA. After Rowe, 
that decision remains well-reasoned to the extent that it relies on the finding that ""[e]nforcing state labor law provisions allowing 
injured contractors' workers to bring personal injury  [*120] claims against airlines would have no significant effect on airline 
deregulation,"" rather than whether the New York law frustrates purpose of the ADA. 104 F. Supp. 2d at 163. "
1042,18," See Chapter 411 of Subpart II, which provides for the certification of United States air carriers to provide air transportation to, 
from, and within the United States. 49 U.S.C. Subpt. VII, Pt. A, Subpt. II. "
1043,19," See Chapter 413 of Subpart II, which provides for the certification of foreign air carriers to provide air transportation to, from, 
 [*127] and within the United States. Id."
1043,20," The plaintiffs also argue that two of the thirty-nine air carriers have failed to satisfy their burden to demonstrate that they were 
authorized to provide air transportation. Because foreign air carriers require an appropriate certificate to legally provide air 
transportation, because these certificates are a matter of public record in various places, (Omnibus Reply Mem. 86 n. 63), and 
because there is no reason to conclude that the airlines operated illegally in the United States, the court declines to conclude 
that these air carriers have failed to satisfy any such burden."
1043,21," The plaintiffs' contention that the ""petitioner's failure in Morales to raise the issue in a timely manner waived their entitlement 
to, and prevented any such consideration of the merits"" (ADA Opp'n Mem. 25), is erroneous. ""A challenge to subject matter 
jurisdiction is not waivable, and may be raised and entertained at any time."" Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506, 126 S. 
Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (""The objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 
12(b)(1), may be raised by a party, or by a court on its own initiative, at any stage in the litigation,  [*129] even after trial and the 
entry of judgment.""); see also FED. R. CIV. PROC. 12(h)(3) (""Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that 
the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.""); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455, 124 S. 
Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004) (noting that a ""litigant generally may raise a court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any 
time in the same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance"")."
1043,22," In 1994, Congress reenacted the Aviation Code. The preemption provision was recodified at 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1) (2000), 
and the language of the provision was revised to the current language. The revision was intended to effect no substantive 
change. See Am. Airlines v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219, 223 n.1, 115 S. Ct. 817, 130 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1995) (""Reenacting Title 49 of 
the U.S. Code in 1994, Congress revised [the language of the preemption provision] . . . Congress intended the revision to make 
no substantive change."") (citation omitted); see also H.R. Rep. No. 103-180, at 1 (1994) (""the purpose of H.R. 1758 is to restate 
in comprehensive form, without substantive change, certain general and permanent laws related to transportation and to enact 
those laws as subtitles II, III, V-X of title 49, United States Code, and to make other technical  [*131] improvements in the code."") 
(emphasis added), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 818, 818. "
1044,23," Although the plaintiffs argue that Lawal incorrectly relied on Morales because Morales did not directly decide the issue, Lawal 
properly concluded that Morales ruled on the issue by implication. See also note 4 supra. "
1045,24," Arguments identical to those made by the parties here have been raised in the context of a motion  [*139] to dismiss a 
complaint in multidistrict litigation pending in the Central District of California, In re Korean Air Lines Co. Ltd. Antitrust Litigation, 
567 F. Supp. 2d 1213 (C.D. Cal.) In re Korean Air Lines is a class action antitrust litigation brought by ticket purchasers for flights 
between the United States and Korea, against Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, alleging a conspiracy among these two airlines to 
fix prices on the purchased flights, and raising state and federal claims. On July 23, 2008, District Judge James Otero granted "
1046,," the defendants' motion to dismiss the state law claims, finding that they were preempted by the ADA, and that foreign air carriers 
were included in the scope of the provision. Id., Dkt. Entry 67 (order granting defendant's motions to dismiss). Judge Otero's 
opinion comports with the reasoning and conclusions reached in the section above."
1046,25," The label ""EU plaintiffs"" is a reference to the types of claims they assert, rather than a reference to their country of 
incorporation. The plaintiffs asserting Count IV are foreign entities who directly purchased air cargo shipping services for 
shipments from the United States to the EU. The plaintiffs asserting Count V are foreign entities that indirectly purchased air 
cargo shipping services for shipments from the United States to the EU. The plaintiffs asserting Count VI are foreign entities that 
directly or indirectly purchased shipping services between the United States and the EU, and to, from or between any EU 
member state, excluding shipments to or from the United States. The plaintiffs asserting Count VII  [*141] are foreign and 
domestic entities who directly or indirectly purchased air cargo shipping services shipments to, from or between any EU member 
states, excluding shipments to or from the United States."
1046,26," In relevant part, Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty states that: The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions 
by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have 
as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular 
those which: (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions; (b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment; (c) share markets or sources of supply . . . . Article 53(1) of the EEA Treaty mirrors the language of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty except that it applies only to Iceland, the 
Principality of Liechtenstein, and the Kingdom of Norway. "
1048,27," The Capital Currency Exchange opinion refers to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, which were later renumbered as Articles 81 
and 82. "
1051,28," The court's reliance on this iteration of comity obviates the need to address the dispute between the parties over whether there 
is, or needs to be, a ""true conflict"" between United States and European Union law. (See EU Opp'n Mem. 32-33, EU Reply Mem. 
5-8.) The plaintiffs argue that ""[u]nder binding Second Circuit authority, ""[i]nternational comity comes into play only when there is 
a true conflict between American law and that of a foreign jurisdiction."" (EU Opp'n Mem. 32.) The issue here, however, is not 
whether compliance with both laws is possible, because, as the plaintiffs concede,  [*163] United States law does not extend to "
1052,," much of the conduct that gives rise to their EU claims. Instead, the issue is which court will apply the EU law. A ""true conflict"" 
arises when the extraterritorial application of United States law imposes obligations that conflict with that territory's laws. See, 
e.g., In re Maxwell Commc'n Corp., 93 F.3d 1036, 1049-50 (2d Cir. 1996) (faced with conflicting obligations of United States and 
British bankruptcy laws)."
1052,29," See Council Regulation 17/62, art. 9, 1962 O.J. (L 13) 204 (""The Commission shall have power to apply Article [81(1)] and 
Article [82] of the Treaty."") "
1053,30," The Regulation also decentralized the public enforcement power, which had previously resided solely in the European 
Commission, to the competition authorities in the member states. Id. at art. 6."
1053,31," The current EC Commissioner for Competition has expressed that Europe does ""not want to cut-and-paste an American style

1053,32," It also bears noting that precedent supporting U.S. adjudication of Article 81 claims would also undermine European amnesty 
programs - vital tools in the detection and prosecution of European cartel behavior, thereby undermining the European interest in 
regulating anticompetitive behavior within the European Union. (See EU Mem. in Supp. 31-32.) "
1055,33," This is because European legal principles conceptualize legal rights as resident in the individual and not assertable on behalf 
of third parties absent consent. (Affidavit of Dr.  [*180] Astrid Stadler Decl. in Support of Omnibus Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. Entry 
502, P 5.) ""Opt-in"" class actions, however, are permitted. (Id. P 9.) "
1058,34," Unless otherwise  [*187] noted, this section draws on the undisputed facts contained in SAA's and the plaintiffs' 
memorandums, exhibits and affidavits on this issue. Where facts are disputed, it will be noted. "
1059,35," SAA cites to a number of cases from other circuits that were decided before Dole v. Patrickson. None of the decisions address 
the issue of whether an entity became a ""foreign state,"" thereby changing from diversity to FSIA jurisdiction, after suit was filed. 
The Ninth Circuit in Wolf v. Banco Nacional de Mexico, S.A., 739 F.2d 1458, 1460 (9th Cir. 1984), indicated that the 
nationalization of a publicly-held bank at the summary judgment stage allowed it to become a ""foreign state"" for the purposes of 
FSIA, but it conducted no explicit analysis of the issue. Ten years later, the Ninth Circuit, while deciding another issue, noted that 
Wolf ""implied that the FSIA may be applicable if a party that becomes a ""foreign state"" after the commencement of a lawsuit 
promptly brings its status as a ""foreign state"" to the district court's attention."" Straub v. A P Green, Inc., 38 F.3d 448, 451 (9th 
Cir. 1994).  [*193] In Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., 764 F.2d 1101, 1104, 1106 (5th Cir. 1985), the court again did not decide the 
issue, but noted that defendant Bancomer was nationalized after the suit was filed in state court, and successfully removed to 
federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(d). Under Dole, however, which unanimously affirmed that an entity seeking removal to 
federal courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(d) must be an instrumentality at the time suit is filed, it is clear that the district court in 
Callejo erred in permitting removal. The only case plaintiffs cite which explicitly found that post-filing change of sovereign status affected the applicability of FSIA is 
Matton v. British Airways Board, Inc., No 85-CV-1268, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11869, 1988 WL 117456, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 27, 
1998). In Matton, the court decided, in an unreported opinion, that the post-filing privatization of an entity changed its jurisdiction 
over it from FSIA to diversity jurisdiction. This court is not alone in disagreeing with the reasoning and decision in Matton. See, 
e.g., Olympia, 509 F.3d at 350. "
1060,36," It should be noted that, according to the Department of Public Enterprise, SAA was nationalized in order to better leverage it 
for the benefit of the South African economy, and the African continent. (SAA Bill at 5; see also Ntuli Decl. P 17, 18.) However, 
SAA does not argue that it could be so leveraged prior to the finalization of the renationalization process. "
1061,37," ""A foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only if the foreign air carrier holds a permit issued under this 
chapter authorizing the foreign air transportation."" 49 U.S.C. § 41301."
1061,38," Saudi Arabian Airways argues that a waiver similar to the one here was noted by the Ninth Circuit to be ""limited in scope to 
'cases with substantial contact with the United States."" (SAA Reply Mem. 4 (citing Compania Mexicana de Aviacion S.A.v. U.S. 
Dist. Court, 859 F.2d 1354, 1359 & n.4 (9th Cir. 1988).) In Mexicana, however, the Ninth Circuit found the waiver inapplicable 
because defendant's ""operations"" that were the ""subject of [plaintiffs'] action did not occur 'under [the] permit' issued by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation."" 859 F.2d at 1359. Notably, the plaintiff in Mexican was suing on basis of air transportation 
services purchased within Mexico for transportation between points solely in Mexico. Id. Here, however, most of defendants' 
operations which are the ""subject of [plaintiffs'] actions"" -- the air cargo services provided to points in the United States from 
abroad -- occur ""under the permit"" or exemption, and  [*202] could only occur pursuant to such permission, issued by the 
Department of Transportation. Claims concerning those air cargo services, therefore, are covered by the waiver. "
1062,39," The cases the defendants cite involve the application of the commercial activity exception, not the interpretation of a waiver. 
 [*204] See, e.g., Moses v. Air Afrique, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2855, 2000 WL 306853 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (Gleeson, J) (finding 
commercial activity exception inapplicable to suit against airline by airline passenger for assault by airlines' ground crew in 
Senegal); Nazarian v. Compagnie Int'l Air Fr., 989 F. Supp. at 507 (addressing application of commercial activity exception.) In 
fact, neither even mention the term waiver. "
1065,1," Heartland also alleges that MICROS has a market share in excess of forty percent in the broader market for POS systems 
used by all restaurants, including both quick service and table service restaurants."
1065,2," It is unclear from the complaint whether merchants could purchase a direct interface from processors like Heartland,  [*6] or 
whether a direct interface must either come with a POS machine, or be purchased from a POS manufacturer. If the latter, then it 
is MICROS' decision not to sell a direct interface for its POS machine, not the agreement at issue, that prevents merchants from 
obtaining a direct interface to processors like Heartland. However, the complaint implies the former: ""Indeed, Paymentech's "
1066,," competitors [,e.g., Heartland,] would provide the same interface to MICROS POS transactions as Merchant link at no additional 
cost to merchants."" Complaint, P 4 (emphasis added). In any event, even if Heartland and other processors do not provide a 
direct interface for MICROS systems, the agreement between MICROS and Merchant Link still prevents merchants from using 
competing gateway services. In other words, the allegations of the complaint allege that the agreement has anti-competitive 
consequences in the gateway market."
1066,3," ""[A] transaction which would cost a non-MICROS using customer of Heartland $ 0.03 to $ 0.04 costs Heartland's customers 
who use MICROS with a high-speed connection $ 0.07 to$ 0.08."" Complaint, P 49."
1066,4," Heartland describes the effect of defendants' arrangement as follows. ""For example, when a Heartland customer purchases a 
MICROS POS system for its restaurant it soon discovers that it cannot continue to process with Heartland at the rate to which it 
is accustomed. The merchant is informed (most often by Heartland) that the processing from a MICROS system entails an 
additional charge of $ 0.04 a transaction, often double their previous rate, because of the fee imposed by Merchant Link. The 
merchant is told that Heartland can do nothing about the additional charge because MICROS requires Heartland to use 
Merchant Link, even though there is no practical reason for the requirement. The merchant discovers that it is bound by its 
MICROS agreement and cannot opt out of the Merchant link 'service.'The merchant next is told (most often by its MICROS 
distributor) that if he switches his processing to Paymentech,  [*11] Paymentech, because it owns Merchant Link, will be able to 
charge a rate lower than that available from Heartland."" Id. P 52. "
1068,5," The Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, provides that, ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is . . . illegal."" Section 4 the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, enables private parties injured by antitrust violations to maintain a private action for treble damages. "
1069,6," Thus, the Court need not distinguish between Heartland's per se and rule of reason tying claims at this juncture. Tying 
arrangements ""can be deemed illegal per se or be found to violate the rule of reason. Per se liability exists where the defendant 
is found to have appreciable market power in the tying market. In such cases, the ability to leverage this power to restrain trade 
in the tied market is presumed and no inquiry need be made into  [*19] the actual prevailing market conditions in that market. 
See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 15-18 & n. 25, 104 S.Ct. at 1559-61 & n. 25; Town Sound, 959 F.2d at 477. Where 
appreciable tying market power cannot be shown, inquiry into the tied product market cannot be avoided, and the plaintiff 
therefore has the more difficult burden of showing that the arrangement violated the rule of reason because it unreasonably 
restrained competition in the tied product market. See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 29, 104 S.Ct. at 1567."" Brokerage Concepts, 
140 F.3d at 511. MICROS' market power in the tying market is not at issue in the present motion."
1069,7," Defendants argue that the complaint merely alleges that the tie forces merchants to take gateway services from Merchant Link 
rather than to agree to not purchase an alternative interface for their MICROS system from any other supplier. Reply Brief, 7. 
This ignores allegations in the complaint: ""Defendants have conspired to squash competition . . . by forcing merchants who buy 
MICROS POS systems to use Paymentech's gateway,"" Complaint, P 36; Defendants ""entered into an agreement pursuant to 
which MICROS' devices exclusively use Merchant-Link services for  [*20] the transmission of electronic transactions,"" Id. P 37; 
""MICROS . . . imposes on purchasers of POS systems the condition that they use only Merchant Link."" Id. P 40. "
1072,8," Heartland's allegations on this point are admittedly confusing. For if processors like Heartland address the technical issues 
involved in maintaining a connection between a POS machine and the processor even absent the tying arrangement, it is 
unclear how Heartland can allege that ""the effect of the Merchant Link tie shifts the entire technical support burden away from 
MICROS and its distributors and puts the burden and expense on the processor."" Complaint, P 8. "
1073,9," Even though Heartland retains the burden of establishing the competitive unreasonableness of the tying arrangement with 
respect to its rule of reason tying claim, the fact that the tying arrangement may relieve MICROS of some its technical support 
burden does necessarily mean that Heartland cannot meet its burden. "
1075,10," It should be emphasized that suffering an antitrust injury is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for antitrust standing. As 
such, on a subsequent motion, defendants may still argue that Heartland lacks standing based on the remaining factors 
enumerated in Broadcom Corp, 501 F.3d at 320, or that Heartland lacks standing to pursue certain damages, namely, damages 
that pose a risk of duplicative recovery. See, e.g., International Raw Materials, Ltd. v. Stauffer Chemical Co., 978 F.2d 1318, 
1329 (3d Cir. 1992) (""Because the industrial consumers of soda ash, for example, could still bring suit and raise these same 
claims, permitting [the plaintiff] to go forward with this claim creates the risk of duplicative recovery."") Moreover, courts have 
barred antitrust claims even where the risk of duplicative recovery is minimal. See Howard Hess Dental Laboratories Inc. v. 
Dentsply Intern., Inc., 424 F.3d 363 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding plaintiff did not have antitrust standing as an indirect purchaser where 
direct purchasers formally released the defendant from antitrust liability); Merican, Inc. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 713 F.2d 958 
(3d Cir. 1983)  [*43] (precluding an indirect purchaser from asserting an antitrust claim because of the risk of duplicative 
recovery where direct purchaser stated in an affidavit it had not suffered any injury from the alleged antitrust conspiracy.). On 
this motion, no argument as to these factors has been presented by defendants to provide the Court a basis for assessing 
standing on these grounds. "
1076,11," Further, because the complaint contains allegations of Paymentech's involvement in the scheme independent of the fact that 
Merchant Lank is a subsidiary of Paymentech, defendants' argument that the complaint ""ignor[es] Merchant Link's separate 
corporate existence"" fails. Defendants Brief, 17. "
1077,12," Defendants argue that Heartland's allegations of ""concealment"" are inconsistent with other allegations in the complaint, 
specifically that Heartland's billing practices reveal Merchant Link fees to the merchant, Complaint, P 52 n. 1, and that MICROS 
distributors ""confirm"" the Merchant Link fees to merchants. Id. P 45. Of course, the allegation required for Heartland's 
explanation of MICROS' motivation to engage in the alleged conspiracy (and the allegation actually contained the complaint) is 
not that merchants never learn about Merchant Link's supracompetitive fees, but that they learn about the fees after they 
purchase their MICROS POS machine, and are ""locked in"" to the agreement between MICROS and Merchant Link. Thus, 
Heartland's concealment theory is consistent with the allegations of the Complaint, and must be considered when assessing 
whether the alleged conspiracy is plausible,  [*54] i.e., makes economic sense. "
1080,1, The Complaint referred to herein is the Corrected Complaint.
1080,2," Lockheed has recently charged $ 75-80 million per P-3 aircraft and attempted to charge $ 125 million per aircraft, but  [*5] it is 
unclear whether any planes have been sold at the latter price. (Compl. PP 14-15). "
1081,3," Although L-3's antitrust claims allege violations of the Sherman Act, L-3's ability to bring such claims derives from sections 4 
and 16 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes antitrust suits by private parties who are threatened with antitrust loss or damage. 15 
U.S.C. §§ 15, 26. "
1082,4," Moreover, the Davray case cited by Lockheed was a determination on summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss. Clearly 
there is a stark difference between determining whether allegations, taken as true, support one element of an antitrust claim and 
determining whether sufficient evidence has been adduced to prove  [*12] each element of a particular antitrust claim. "
1084,5," As Lockheed properly notes, in Taylor Publishing, the Fifth Circuit cited an antitrust treatise that argues that tortious 
interference with current contracts should not be cognizable under section 2 of the Sherman Act. Taylor Publ'g Co. v. Jostens, 
Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 484 (5th Cir. 2000). However, the Fifth Circuit expressly did not adopt that treatise's statement or base its 
holding on that idea. Id."
1084,6," This test originated in the case law in the Second Circuit case of National Ass'n of Pharm. Mfrs., Inc. v. Ayerst Labs, 850 F.2d 
904, 916 (2d Cir. 1988) in which the court adopted the test based on a suggestion in an antitrust treatise. In applying the test, the 
court reversed a dismissal, at the preliminary stage, of a violation of the Sherman Act based on publication of a letter about the 
plaintiff's product, which the plaintiff alleged was false and misleading. The court also appeared ready to balance the six factors 
in its ultimate determination (instead of applying them conjunctively), as  [*22] it allowed discovery to proceed even though it 
found it unlikely that the plaintiff would succeed on factors four or five. Id. at 916-917. "
1085,7," Although the Aldridge court and others use the term ""clearly false,"" the Court finds that terminology more appropriate in the 
original false advertising cases from which the six factor test derived, where a consumer might be able to readily examine a 
physical product to determine whether the speech was false. While the Court finds that the extent of the falsity of the statement 
may be relevant to the believability of the speech, and hence its ultimate exclusionary effect, it cannot be said that simply 
because the parties disagree about whether something is false that a claim based on that disputed statement would fail as a 
basis for an antitrust claim at the preliminary motion to dismiss stage."
1085,8," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine originated in two Supreme Court cases--Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor 
Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), which established the constitutional immunity flowing from the right of petition to the government. 
The Supreme Court later extended immunity to specifically include petition to the judicial branch through litigation activities. 
California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972). "
1086,9," The fact that the Georgia litigation is being heavily litigated does not determine the objective reasonableness of the litigation for 
many reasons. First, there was no preliminary injunction application, and thus there is not even  [*29] a preliminary 
determination of Lockheed's likely success on the merits. Second, as mentioned, there has been no final determination on the 
merits. Third, it is plausible that Lockheed made the business decision to spend a few million dollars engaging in baseless trade 
secret litigation and threatening suppliers in order to deter potential foreign customers, whose contracts are worth hundred of 
millions of dollars, from considering contracting with its alleged only real competitor in the P-3 market-L-3."
1086,10," The Court notes that the Noerr-Pennington is also potentially available to Lockheed as a defense to L-3's state law tortious 
interference claims. Video Int'l Prod., Inc. v. Warner-Amex Cable Comms., Inc., 858 F.2d 1075, 1084 (5th Cir. 1988). However, 
for the same reasons applicable to the antitrust claims, the Court cannot rely on this alleged immunity to dismiss the state law 
claims at this time. "
1087,11, Def.'s Br. at 19.
1087,12," This is comparatively more stringent that the Noerr-Pennington defense, as with that defense Lockheed has an absolute 
right/immunity based on bringing a lawsuit and, even with respect to threats, it would only have to show that they were made in 
anticipation of litigation. L-3 then bears the burden of showing that such litigation would be, or is, a sham. "
1088,13," The Texas Supreme Court has not definitively established the elements necessary for a cause of action for tortious 
interference with prospective business relationships. Nano-Proprietary, Inc. v. Canon, Inc., 537 F.3d 394, 2008 WL 2854816, at 
*6-7 (5th Cir. 2008). The Fifth Circuit has noted its belief that there are two lines of thought in Texas Appellate  [*36] courts 
regarding the elements, with the only difference being in the first element requirement of some courts of only a business 
relationship and other courts requiring a more formal contractual relationship. Apani Southwest, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Enters., Inc., 
300 F.3d 620, 634-635 (5th Cir. 2002). As of yet, the Fifth Circuit has not determined the issue of the extent of the required 
relationship, and this Court finds it unnecessary to do so as well. Id. A contractual relationship versus a business relationship 
seems to be a distinction without difference in this case, as L-3 has pled that Lockheed is interfering with its ability to enter into 
contracts."
1088,14," None of the Texas state court cases cited by Lockheed involve dismissal at the pleading stage of the proceedings and are 
thus inapposite at this time. See, e.g., Richardson-Eagle, Inc. v. William M. Mercer, Inc., 213 S.W.3d 469, 475-476 (Tex. App.--
Hous. [1st Dist.] 2006, rev. den'd) (determining claim for tortious interference based on summary judgment evidence). "
1091,1," ""HTC"" is also used to refer to HTC Sweden, HTC, LLC, and HTC, Inc. collectively. "
1096,2," In a footnote, HTC also asserts that Innovatech generally failed to allege claims under the the Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. § 8, 
and the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. The Court only addresses HTC's specific arguments for dismissal. "
1098,3," ""It is as important to the public that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents, as that the patentee of a really 
valuable invention should be protected in his monopoly."" Lear, Inc., 395 U.S. at 663-64 (citation omitted). However, patents are 
presumptively valid and the burden of proof to overcome this presumption is on the party attacking its validity. See Tillotson Mfg. 
Co. v. Textron, Inc., 337 F.2d 833, 841 (6th Cir. 1964) (citing 35 U.S.C. § 282). While Innovatech states that Contec's legal 
counsel advised Contec that HTC's patents were unenforceable, Innovatech itself does not challenge the patents or provide 
facts to support a claim that the patents were unenforceable. Accordingly, the Court will treat HTC's patents numbered 700327 
and 5637032 as valid for the purposes of this discussion."
1098,4," Innovatech originally alleged wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 as a predicate offense but it agrees in its response to 
no longer rely upon wire fraud. Innovatech also alleges extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(d) in Counterclaim X. However, 
as noted by HTC, 18 U.S.C. § 875(d) is not a predicate offense under the RICO statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). "
1130,1," For purposes of clarification, if the Merger does not occur, the Charitable Commitment shall terminate and this letter shall be of 
no further force or effect. "
1154,1," Establishing that Alexa has engaged in sham litigation would not appear to support a section 1 claim because there is no 
""contract, conspiracy or combination"" between two entities. See 15 U.S.C. § 1. O'Driscoll is Alexa's CEO, and as its agent, 
cannot ""conspire"" with Alexa in violation of section 1. "
1155,2," This does not leave Girafa lacking a remedy. If Alexa's litigation ends in Girafa's favor and was as baseless as Girafa suggests, 
Girafa can bring a claim for malicious  [*7] prosecution. See Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., 50 Cal.3d 1118, 1130-
31, 270 Cal. Rptr. 1, 791 P.2d 587 (1990) (explaining the elements of a malicious prosecution claim). "
1156,3," Given the tenor of the Legislature's findings, it is difficult to imagine that it contemplated that a series of patent disputes 
between two companies would represent the exercise of the right to petition ""in connection with a public issue."" However, the 
law specifically defines this phrase as including ""any written or oral statement or writing made before a . . . judicial proceeding."" 
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(e)(1). Thus, Alexa's litigation in Texas qualifies for protection under the anti-SLAPP law."
1156,4," The court refers to the exceptions as ""narrow"" based on their use of highly specific language, and also because section 425.16 
contains a mandate to the courts to interpret the section ""broadly."" Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(a). Section 425.17 lacks any 
similar directive. "
1168,1," The parties have submitted the following briefs in connection with Defendants' motion to dismiss: Defendants' Joint 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended 
Complaint (""Defs.' Mem.""); Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion  [**15] to Dismiss and to Strike 
Portions of Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (""Pls.' Opp'n""); and Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Further Support of Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (""Defs.' 
Reply"")."
1168,2," The parties have submitted the following briefs in connection with Plaintiffs' motion to amend: Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in 
Support of Their Motion for Leave to Amend Paragraph 99 of the Complaint (Pls.' P 99 Mem.""), and Defendants' Memorandum 
of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend Paragraph Ninety-Nine (99) of the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint 
(""Defs.' P 99 Opp'n""). "
1169,3," The SCAC alleges that Defendants Bertelsmann, WMG and EMI launched MusicNet, while UMG and Sony launched 
""pressplay,"" originally called ""Duet."" (SCAC PP 67, 72.)"
1169,4," ""Digital rights management"" refers to the restrictions on a consumer's use of Internet Music. (See SCAC P 75.) The SCAC also 
notes that the joint ventures allowed Defendants ""to engage in the anticompetitive practice of tying or 'bundling' Internet Music 
onto a single online 'album.'"" (Id. P 84.)"
1169,5," The SCAC alleges that, at the same time Defendants licenced their music to the joint ventures, they also licensed it to third-
party vendors. The SCAC notes that Defendants also enforced their agreement during the joint venture phase by imposing the 
same price and use restrictions on the third party licensees and, further, by penalizing such licensees with higher prices or 
license termination if they dealt with other record labels. (Id. P 79.) "
1170,6," The SCAC also  [**20] alleges that the Recording Industry Association of America (""RIAA""), allegedly the main industry trade 
association and under Defendants' control, ""provides another forum and means through which Defendants can communicate 
about the pricing, terms and use restrictions they collectively agree upon with respect to Internet Music."" (SCAC P 88.) "
1171,7," Those terms describe the process ""by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, setting their 
prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence 
with respect to price and output decisions."" Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. 
Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). "
1172,8," Plaintiffs do not argue that the joint ventures themselves violate the antitrust laws: ""[I]t is not the existence or creation  [**30] of 
these joint ventures that form the basis of the Plaintiffs' allegations. Rather, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants . . . used those 
ventures as a means to implement their anticompetitive agreements."" Pls.' Supp. Opp'n 10; see also Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) (noting that joint ventures who ""hold the 
promise of increasing a firm's efficiency and enabling it to compete here effectively"" are reviewed under the rule of reason). "
1173,9," I may consider the Bulcao complaint as a predecessor to the SCAC. See United States v. GAF Corp., 928 F.2d 1253, 1259 (2d 
Cir. 1991) (""[T]he law is quite clear that HN4[
] superseded pleadings in civil cases may constitute admissions of party 
opponents, admissible in the case in which they were originally filed, as well as any subsequent litigation involving that party."" 
(citing United States v. McKeon, 738 F.2d 26, 31 (2d Cir. 1984)))."
1173,10," I am permitted to take judicial notice of the Tucker complaint under Rule 201 (b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Kramer 
v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir. 1991)."
1173,11," Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants ""conspired to mask their anticompetitive conduct by pretextually establishing rules to 
prevent antitrust violations"" (SCAC P 90) is wholly conclusory. Further, I decline to infer that the joint ventures were designed to 
hide a true purpose of information sharing simply because Defendants structured them so as to comply  [**34] with the antitrust 
laws."
1173,12," Some guidance may also be taken from the cases limiting the inference that may be drawn from allegations of antitrust 
conspiracy in other markets, see, e.g., Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 595-96, or from commentary recognizing the limits of allegations "
1174,," of earlier conspiracy in the same market, see 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, § 1421b(3). Of course, the inference of agreement 
is weaker here a fortiori because Plaintiffs do not claim that the joint ventures were illegal."
1174,13," Inertia is yet another possible explanation for Defendants' parallel conduct that does not implicate prior agreement. As Areeda 
and Hovenkamp discuss, parallel conduct can just as easily result from convention, under which circumstances an inference of 
prior agreement is illogical. See 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, § 1410c (quoting and discussing D. Lewis, Convention: A 
Philosophical Study (1969)). "
1175,14," Plaintiffs seek leave to amend SCAC Paragraph 99. Because I conclude that their proposed amendment would be futile, leave 
to amend is DENIED. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962); Jin v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 
310 F.3d 84, 101 (2d Cir. 2002). "
1176,15," Judge Posner observes how judicial treatment of the ""plus factors"" analysis has often mistakenly demanded evidence of 
actual agreement: ""[w]hat the cases seem to mean, however, and what some of them make explicit, is that there must be an 
explicit agreement based upon actual communication between the parties."" See Posner, supra, at 94 (emphasis in original, 
footnote  [**44] omitted); see id. at 99-100 (discussing language in Monsanto that aggravates judicial confusion regarding proof 
of tacit agreement). He argues against that requirement: ""[i]f the economic evidence presented in a case warrants an inference 
of collusive pricing, there is neither legal nor practical justification for requiring evidence that will support the further inference 
that the collusion was explicit rather than tacit."" See id. at 94."
1176,16," Plaintiffs allege that the Digital Music market is characterized by low buyer-side concentration because ""there are thousands of 
class members."" (See Pls.' Opp'n 9.) That assertion is undermined somewhat by the allegation elsewhere in the SCAC that 
Defendants sold largely to retailers (see SCAC PP 56-57, 79), a group as to whose size the SCAC is silent Further, it is worth 
noting that SCAC's description of the market for Internet Music is inconsistent in some basic respects with the type of market 
Judge Posner describes as vulnerable to price collusion. That is to say, as it is described in the SCAC, the Internet Music market 
is not characterized by the relative inability of competitors to increase supply or decrease prices to challenge effectively 
 [**45] the conspirators' market control, see Posner, supra, at 63-64, but rather as one where, for instance, eMusic was able to 
increase its ""production"" rapidly through relationships with ""hundreds of independent record labels,"" sufficient even to surpass 
Defendants in the market (see SCAC P 104)."
1176,17," It should be noted that the paragraphs in the SCAC invoked to support the claim that Plaintiffs have pleaded high barriers to 
market entry (see Pls.' Opp'n 11 (citing SCAC PP 55-57)) do not mention barriers to market entry. Paragraph 55 states: 
""Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class, thereby making final injunctive relief or 
corresponding declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the Class as a whole."" Paragraphs 56 and 57 duplicate each other, 
and state: ""Defendants produce, license and distribute Digital Music, including Internet Music and CDs, to retailers for sale 
throughout the United States and in some instances sell Internet Music and CDs directly to consumers through Internet sites, 
record clubs and other entities which they own or control."""
1176,18," Paragraph 136(n) of the SCAC purports to assert claims under the ""New York common law against restraints of trade."" New 
York law includes an antitrust provision, called the Donnelly Act. See N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340 et seq. (McKinney 2004). 
Nevertheless, Plaintiffs state that it is not their intention to bring any claim under that Act (see Pls.' Opp'n 29 n.29); and they do 
not discuss or even identify the distinct ""common law against restraints of trade"" upon which to base their claim Therefore, to the 
extent the SCAC asserts claims under New York law apart from its claims under New York's Consumer Protection from 
Deceptive  [**47] Acts and Practices provisions, see N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 346 (McKinney 2004), those claims are DISMISSED. 
In any event, the substantive provisions of the Donnelly Act mirror federal antitrust law, see, e.g., State v. Mobil Oil Corp., 38 
N.Y.2d 460, 463, 344 N.E.2d 357, 359, 381 N.Y.S.2d 426 (1976); Reading Int'l, Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Mgmt. LLC, 317 F. Supp. "

1185,3," The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, which was premised solely on jurisdictional grounds. It is unclear, 
however, whether the FTAIA is more appropriately viewed as withdrawing jurisdiction from the federal courts when a plaintiff fails 
to establish proximate cause  [**6] or as simply establishing a limited cause of action requiring plaintiffs to prove proximate 
cause as an element of the claim. Compare Empagran S.A. v. F. Hoffmann-Laroche, Ltd., 368 U.S. App. D.C. 18, 417 F.3d "
1186,1267," , 1268-69, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (affirming dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), with In re 
Elevator Antitrust Litigation, 502 F.3d 47, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2007) (affirming dismissal on 12(b)(6) grounds). The Supreme Court's 
decision in Empagran I provides little guidance because, although the district court had dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court 
did not explicitly address whether the issue was properly viewed as one of federal question subject matter jurisdiction or of a 
failure to state a claim under federal law. We decline to resolve the question, because it was not argued by the parties and in this 
case the result and analysis are the same. Accordingly, we assume without deciding that the district court correctly dismissed 
under Rule 12(b)(1)."
1186,4," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1186,5," HN3[
] The FTAIA states: Sections 1 to 7 of [the Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or 
import commerce) with foreign nations unless -- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect -- (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce 
with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the 
United States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section. § 6a. "
1187,6," We focus on whether the exception to the FTAIA's general rule excluding application of the Sherman Act is available because it 
is undisputed that the alleged price-fixing conduct falls within the FTAIA's general rule because the price-fixing activity 
constitutes ""conduct involving trade or commerce . . . with  [**10] foreign nations."" § 6a."
1187,7," The Areeda & Hovenkamp treatise comments on this open question as follows: Clearly [the Supreme Court] could not have meant that the mere fact that this was a conspiracy involving both sellers and 
buyers all over the world was sufficient. To be sure, in such a conspiracy the injury to any particular buyer is linked to the 
injury suffered by other buyers or else the conspiracy would not work. . . . But the forbearance of one cartel member from cutting price or shipping into another cartel member's territory is necessary 
to the functioning of every cartel. To interpret ""linkage"" of foreign and domestic injury this broadly would have undermined 
the entirety of the Court's opinion, which unambiguously held that foreign plaintiffs injured by a conspiracy that also injured 
American  [**12] purchasers could not sue under the Sherman Act. Areeda & Hovenkamp P 272i5, pp. 317-18. "
1188,8," The case before us illustrates this point well. At oral argument, Centerprise acknowledged ""[it] could"" bring suit in the United 
Kingdom against the defendants for their anticompetitive conduct. We recognize that some of the defendants here are American 
corporations, but many are not, and Centerprise does not dispute that all of its purchases were made outside U.S. commerce, 
making real the risk of interference with a foreign nation's ability to regulate its commercial affairs. "
1189,9," Centerprise's argument that its case is similar to Caribbean Broadcasting Systems, Ltd. v. Cable and Wireless PLC, 331 U.S. 
App. D.C. 226, 148 F.3d 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1998), and MM Global Services v. Dow Chemical Co., 329 F. Supp. 2d 337 (D. Conn. 
2004), also fails. First, it is questionable whether Caribbean Broadcasting has any relevance, because it pre-dates Empagran I 
and does not interpret the provision of the FTAIA at issue here. See Caribbean Broad., 148 F.3d at 1087. Second, the case is 
factually distinguishable. There, the plaintiff alleged the defendants violated the Sherman Act in maintaining a broadcast 
monopoly in the eastern  [**20] Caribbean by misrepresenting to its advertising customers the breadth of the station's 
broadcasting reach, an effect of which was that U.S. advertisers paid excessive prices for advertising. This effect in the United 
States directly caused the plaintiff to lose revenue because it could not sell advertising to the same U.S. businesses. Centerprise 
alleges no such foreclosure of the market by rivals. MM Global Services is also inapposite because the plaintiffs there pled direct 
participation in domestic commerce, unlike Centerprise whose complaint concerns only wholly foreign transactions. The plaintiffs 
argued that the defendants fixed minimum resale prices and other terms for selling and reselling products in and from the United 
States, and compelled plaintiffs to agree to engage in a price maintenance conspiracy, thereby injuring the plaintiffs by 
precluding them from fully competing in the sales of their products. See MM Global Services, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 342."
1189,10," Most notably, paragraph 75 of its complaint alleges: Memory purchases are a 24 hour global business, dependent in large part on United States events. For example, Plaintiff 
and many Class members start their days with communications to Defendants in Taiwan and Korea to understand what "
1190,," pricing is available for DRAM, and as the day goes on follow sales in the United States. Plaintiff and Class members were 
required to track the DRAM prices in dollars, which was the only available measure due to Defendants' sales and 
distribution practices, then work on dollar exchange rates in order to buy the DRAM at the best available price worldwide. 
The United States prices were the source of, and substantially affected the worldwide DRAM prices. The significance of these assertions, however, is not self-evident and Centerprise has not elaborated on how any of its asserted 
facts show that the higher U.S. DRAM prices proximately caused the excessive DRAM prices that Centerprise paid."
1190,11," In light of our decision on FTAIA subject matter jurisdiction and the district court's refusal of leave to amend the complaint, we 
do not reach defendants' contention that Centerprise lacks antitrust standing."

1194,3," ""Goldfein Decl."" refers to the declaration of Shepherd Goldfein,  [*8] sworn to on June 2, 2008. Because MSG incorporates the

1199,6," The MCM Court, it should be noted, did not take up the question of whether an ""affirmation"" of a pre-release agreement might 
constitute a ""new, post-Release"" agreement, see 161 F.3d at 448 (emphasis added), and so it is cited here for the more limited 
purpose of discrediting MSG's argument that antitrust claims can never be released when they are predicated on alleged 
ongoing violations. "
1201,7," The authors of Antitrust Law have observed that ""the more recent decisions have paid increased attention to what the plaintiff 
knew or should have known when the initial act constituting the violation occurred."" P 320c1, at 288-89. This consideration would 
clearly weigh in favor of the League because the policies being challenged have been in existence for well over ten years. The 
Court notes, however, that in Klehr the Supreme Court indicated that a plaintiff's knowledge ought not play in a role in 
determining  [*35] whether there is a continuing violation. 521 U.S. at 189. "
1208,1," Defendants additionally challenge the expert opinion testimony of Michael McCormack as being irrelevant and unreliable. 
Because McCormack is a rebuttal expert witness, the Court reserves judgment on the admissibility of his testimony. Discover is 
directed not to address the disputed portions of McCormack's testimony in its opening remarks."
1208,2," Because Discover must prove that its alleged injury was caused in substantial part by the issuance bans, MasterCard's motion 
in limine to preclude any evidence that any MasterCard member, between June 1996 and October 2004, was unwilling to do 
third-party acquiring for Discover due to the CPP's issuance ban is DENIED."
1208,3," Similarly, there is no basis in the record to challenge the qualifications of Dr. Hausman. Dr. Hausman is qualified as an expert 
witness in the field of economics given his extensive credentials, including his education, experience and general knowledge of 
the subject matter. See McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., 61 F.3d 1038, 1043 (2d Cir. 1995). "
1209,4," The Court notes that this finding is not inconsistent with its prior ruling that ""the entirety of [alleged] damages stemming from 
the failure to engage in third-party acquiring must flow from the issuance ban, not the acquiring ban, which has never been found 
unlawful."" Discover Fin. Svs. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., No. 04 Civ. 7844, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63566, 2008 WL 3884383, at *15 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2008). Regardless of potential alternative causes, Discover still bears  [**11] the ultimate burden of proving 
that its damages with respect to third-party acquirers flowed from the issuance bans themselves. See Phillip E. Areeda, et al., 2A 
Antitrust Law P 338a (2007) (describing burden-shifting scheme with regard to causation); Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 297 (2d Cir. 1979) (HN6[
] ""[P]laintiffs in an antitrust action must prove injury of the type the antitrust 
laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."") (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). The Court cautions, however, that Discover's explanation of the difference between disaggregation of damages and causation is 
potentially misleading in this case. See Discover's Mem. at 5 (HN7[
] ""[W]hile potential alternative causes need to be taken into 
account in terms of disaggregating damages, it is well-settled that a plaintiff need not disaggregate a cause that is intertwined 
with the illegal conduct.""). To be clear, disaggregation of damages applies when an antitrust plaintiff is claiming injury caused by 
one or more of the defendant's unlawful practices. See, e.g., MCI Commc'ns Corp. v. AT&T Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1161 (7th Cir. 
1983). ""The  [**12] disaggregation requirement is distinct from the requirement that the plaintiff's damage calculations must 
control for exogenous factors that also have an adverse impact on the plaintiff's economic conditions."" Areeda, et al., 2A 
Antitrust Law P 392g. Because the CPP acquiring ban is not being challenged as unlawful conduct in the instant litigation, the 
disaggregation analogy is inapt. Instead, the CPP acquiring ban is an ""exogenous factor"" that must be accounted for in 
Discover's damage calculations, as ultimately the jury must have a reasonable basis for separating the impact of the alleged 
unlawful violations from other factors. See id. at P 338a. "
1210,5," Hanft's testimony is relevant for the reasons explained above. The Court also finds that the probative value of this evidence 
substantially outweighs the possibility for prejudice to the Defendants under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Accordingly, 
MasterCard's motion in limine to preclude Discover from calling Hanft as a witness at trial  [**15] on this ground is denied."
1210,6," In this regard, MasterCard's voluntary repeal of the acquiring ban is relevant to the issue of damages flowing from Discover's 
alleged inability to engage third-party acquirers. The Court finds that the probative value of this evidence substantially outweighs 
the possibility for prejudice to the Defendants under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Further, Defendants' argument that allowing 
evidence of the voluntary repeal would contravene the policy against admitting evidence of a ""subsequent remedial measure,"" is 
meritless on the ground that the acquiring ban was never challenged as being unlawful conduct. See Fed. R. Evid. 407. 
Defendants' objection that MasterCard's acquiring ban was repealed based on ""privileged legal considerations,"" likewise fails. 
MasterCard merely speculates that it ""would"" have come to the decision to repeal its acquiring ban only after extensive 
consultation with its attorneys. Defs. Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. to Preclude Evidence Referencing MasterCard's Voluntary Repeal 
of the Acquiring Prohibition Component of the CPP at 3. This statement, however, is contradicted by Hanft's testimony that the 
CPP acquiring prohibition was eliminated because  [**16] the ""business reason"" for adopting it ""related primarily to consistency"" 
with the existence of the issuing prohibition. Kadetsky Decl. P 2, Ex. D, at 257 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court denies 
Defendants' motion in limine to preclude the fact that the CPP acquiring ban was voluntarily repealed. "
1211,7," Moreover, the Court notes that the possibility of some un-eliminated causes does not render Dr. Hausman's testimony 
unreliable. See Astra Aktiebolag v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 222 F. Supp. 2d 423, 488 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Defendants are free to 
persuade the jury at trial that their explanation of Discover's inability to use third-party acquirers is equally or more likely. "
1219,1," Plaintiff attempts to distinguish City of Columbia from the instant case. First, Plaintiff notes that City of Columbia ""did not involve 
an agreement among multiple competitors that restrains trade, which is then made applicable to all other competitors through 
legislation that is expressly intended to 'neutralize' competition from those non signatories."" (Pl.'s Br. 6.) However, City of 
Columbia's relevant holding-that HN8[
] courts should not consider the official intent behind legislation that allegedly 
neutralizes competition-did not depend on the number of competitors that were party to  [*13] the agreement to restrain trade. Second, Plaintiff observes that the instant case, unlike City of Columbia, does not involve allegations of bribery or improper 
campaign contributions designed to secure favorable legislation. Again, however, these facts were not essential to City of 
Columbia's relevant holding."
1219,2," Though Plaintiff mostly discusses the relevance of the ""intended purpose of State regulation"" to its antitrust claim, in a footnote 
Plaintiff suggests that it is also relevant to its dormant commerce clause claim. (Pl.'s Br. 6 n.2.) To the extent that Plaintiff refers 
to the official intent behind the regulation, this is an impermissible inquiry, per City of Columbia. To the extent that Plaintiff refers 
to the private intent of the OPMs in drafting the MSA, this is irrelevant. As the Second Circuit made clear in Freedom Holdings, 
HN11[
] to prevail on the dormant commerce clause claim, Plaintiff must show that the restraints have ""the practical [*15] effect of controlling commerce occurring wholly outside that State's borders."" 357 F.3d 205, 219. This prospective inquiry 
examines the effects of the restraints and not the intent-private or otherwise-behind it. Plaintiff cites C&A Carbone v. Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 114 S. Ct. 1677, 128 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1994), and Buck v. Kuykendall, 
267 U.S. 307, 45 S. Ct. 324, 69 L. Ed. 623 (1925), for the proposition that a restraint's design or purpose is relevant to dormant "
1220,," commerce clause analysis. In both of those cases, however, the Supreme Court only truly considered the effects of the restraint 
of trade at issue. "
1222,1," The earliest date the ANDAs could have been filed by generic manufacturers was September 2002, one year prior to expiration 
of Aventis's patent for Arava, in the form of challenges to the patent. (Pl. 56.1 Response P 24.) Aventis de-listed the patent for 
Arava in August 2002 at which point no challenge to the patent was feasible prior to the five year period of marketing. Id. The six 
month extension for pediatric marketing exclusivity under 21 U.S.C. § 355a extended the exclusivity to March 10, 2004. (Def. 
SOF PP 23, 31.)"
1222,2," The Defendants learned in February 2005 that the companies marketing in Canada did in fact reference the 100 mg loading 
dose in their label. (Pl. 56.1 Response P 36, PEx. 32.) Thus, the basis for Defendants' Petition-- that they were concerned that 
U.S. generic manufacturers would similarly market the drug without mentioning or producing the 100 mg loading dose--was not 
only speculative, but completely undermined by this revelation. "
1223,3," The 100 mg strength served as a loading dose to be taken for three days to ""quickly reach steady state plasma concentrations"" 
of the metabolized form of leflunomide. (See Compl., Exh. 1, at 2.) Aventis stopped selling the 100-mg tablet in pharmacies in 
January 2002, but continued distribution at no charge to physicians via blister packs of three tablets for the loading dose. (Def. 
Rule 56.1 SOF PP 19-20.)"
1223,4," The Life Cycle Management Group, or the ""Life Cycle Prolongation Department"" is a unit  [*7] charged with evaluating potential 
life cycle management projects, i.e. to prolong sales of Defendants' products. (Pl. 56.1 SOAF P 24, Def. Ex. 27, Gardella Tr. 
20:20-21:15.) The mission statement of the group is to ""mitigate generic erosion and to prolong, as much as possible, the life 
cycle of our products."" (Pl. 56.1 SOAF P 24.) "
1225,5," Though not appropriate for the objective prong analysis, throughout their memorandum Defendants insist that the reason for 
their having filed the Citizen Petition was their concern for safety, even though such statements are more appropriate for the 
subjective prong of the sham exception. To the extent that they raised these issues, and that it does implicate their knowledge of 
the need or lack thereof for the loading dose, the following internal reports and studies show that the loading dose was not 
necessarily safe or more effective than non-use of a loading dose. The Arava(R) label itself said the loading dose was 
recommended but also cautioned that the drug was safer without the loading dose for most users (Def. Ex. 19, March 2004 
Arava label  [*15] at 23). They knew that they themselves had ceased to supply the loading dose to pharmacies and retailers as 
doctors had abandoned the loading dose for safety reasons due to tolerability problems and risk of discontinuance (ASOF 60-64: 
Strobos Rep.; PEx. 18, 19 e-mails Dr. Steve Kovacs, Sanofi-Aventis Clinical Pharmacologist). They knew that at least one study 
found that Arava was safer without the loading dose (see Strobos Report) and many other internal reports cited safety concerns 
with adults and children (see Pl. Ex. 17, Dr. Kovacs and Dr. Jun Shi, Population Pharmacokinetics Report, August 21, 2003)."
1225,6," The FDA letter states in relevant part: As does the approved labeling for Arava . . . approved labeling for generic leflunomide products would include the 
recommendation of using 100-mg tablets for the loading dose. . . . As reflected by existing precedents, ANDA sponsors 
may refer in their labeling to products they do not manufacture. . . . It is also not uncommon for brand name products to 
refer in their labeling to other drugs that are not provided by the sponsor of the brand name product  [*17] (e.g., the labeling 
of Oncaspar, an Aventis product, recommends its use in combination with . . . products not made by Aventis . . .). (Def. Ex. 73, at 6-7.) "
1226,7," The drug was actually Arava(R) with a different stamp, and hence did not require an ANDA to be filed."
1226,8," From May 10-12, 2005 a series of internal Aventis emails confirmed that there was no requirement for its generic partner, 
Prasco, to produce the 100 mg leflunomide tablet, but the Arava version and loading dose information should be referenced in 
the generic partner label."
1226,9," Causation is a necessary element of any claim for relief under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which is the provision for treble 
damages for antitrust injury to a private plaintiff. 15 U.S.C. § 15; Discover Financial Services, DFS v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 
04cv7844, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65627, 2008 WL 4067445 (S.DN.Y. Aug. 26, 2008) (citing Argus v. Eastman Kodak Co., 801 
F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir. 1986))."
1226,10," See also Dr. Scott Gottlieb, M.D., speech before Annual Generic Drug Forum, Apr. 7, 2006. (Def. Ex. 159.) "
1227,11," Defendants do not challenge Ms. Bennett's credentials. ""Ms. Bennett is currently an independent consultant on FDA matters, 
including technical and regulatory matters concerning ANDA's, and prior to that worked for FDA itself."" (Pl. Opp. Mem. to Excl. 
Expert P 3.) ""She worked for the FDA for thirteen (13) years."" (Id. P 3.) ""Ms. Bennett has taught and lectured extensively on FDA 
regulatory requirements and has reviewed hundreds of NDA's and ANDA's."" (Id. P 3.) ""Half of the work she did with the FDA as 
a field investigator pertained to generic drugs."" (Id. P 4.) ""She was involved in responding to approximately twenty CP's and has 
continued to be involved with CP's, particularly involving generic drugs, following her departure from FDA.""  [*22] (Id. P 4.)"
1227,12," See also Bennett Dep. Tr. 196 -- explaining why ANDA review may slow down in face of a Citizen Petition: ""Because the 
Citizen Petition may generate a higher pressure than the pressure to meet a deadline on an ANDA. Citizens Petitions can go to 
litigation and having worked on them and having written defenses for the agency's position, I remember spending time doing 
legal research and writing essentially briefs in response to Citizens Petitions just in the anticipation that our decision might go 
before a court."" Bennett cites to numerous FDA reports, congressional hearings and bills focusing on this very issue. "
1228,13," These are 1) FDA Law Blog June 7, 2007 and 2) Kaufman, ""Petitions to FDA Sometimes Delay Generic Drugs"" July 3, 2006."
1228,14," These items include the public agency statements of the FDA head concerning activities of the agency, Report to the House 
and Senate Committee on Appropriations to discuss the abuse of Citizen Petitions; Aventis's own intelligence reports forecasting 
entry of generics into the marketplace and strategy reports. "
1238,1," Accordingly, whether Smithfield's allegedly inequitable conduct has a sufficient ""nexus"" to the  [**18] pending matter to qualify 
for an unclean hands defense is of no consequence. "
1244,*," Honorable T. John Ward, District Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, sitting by designation. "
1245,1," The filer of a Paragraph IV ANDA certifies that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic drug. 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV)."
1245,2, Barr did not certify that its product did not infringe the '444 patent. 
1246,3," Notably, the Agreements were entered into before the 2003 amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, requiring a patent holder 
and a first Paragraph IV ANDA filer who settle their patent litigation to file their agreement with the Federal Trade Commission 
and Department of Justice for review, and if the agreement is found to violate the antitrust laws, the first ANDA filer loses its right 
to the 180-day exclusivity period. Pub. L. No. 108-173, § 1112; see 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(V)."
1246,4," Barr, however, preserved the option to reamend its ANDA to a Paragraph IV certification--in order to reclaim the 180-day 
exclusivity period--in the event a court declared the '444 patent to be invalid or unenforceable."
1246,5," Added to the $ 49.1 million initial payment, the payments from Bayer to Barr totaled $ 398.1 million. Barr shared the payments 
equally with HMR. "
1247,6," In Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965), 
the Supreme Court held that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent office may be a violation of the 
Sherman Act provided that the other elements necessary to a Sherman Act claim are present. Id. at 177. Here, however, the 
plaintiffs alleged a violation of state antitrust laws."
1247,7," The court further noted that there was a serious question whether the indirect purchasers even had standing to assert a Walker 
Process claim. Id. at 547."
1247,8," Count V is subject to exclusive federal court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) because the determination of fraud before 
the PTO necessarily involves a substantial question of patent law. See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 
800, 808, 108 S. Ct. 2166, 100 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1988). "
1248,9," Specifically,  [**16] the appellants contend that there are genuine issues of material fact relating to whether the defendants 
received far more under the Agreements then they could have had Barr won the litigation against Bayer, invalidated the '444 
patent, and entered the market. Further, the appellants aver that the court needs to assess the apparent strength of the patent at 
the time of the Agreements. "
1250,10," Under the Cipro Supply Agreement, however, Barr was allowed to sell a competing ciprofloxacin product six months before 
the '444 patent expired."
1250,11," Indeed, a sizable exclusion payment from the patent holder to the generic manufacturer is not unexpected under the Hatch-
Waxman Act, where the relative risks of litigation are redistributed. Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d at 1074; see infra pp. 23-24. "
1252,12," Although certain statements by the Eleventh Circuit have been interpreted to mean that it advocated consideration of the 
validity of the patent, Brief for the United States at *16, Joblove, 551 U.S. 1144, 127 S. Ct. 3001, 168 L. Ed. 2d 726 (No. 06-
830); Brief for the United States at *17-19, Schering-Plough 548 U.S. 919, 126 S. Ct. 2929, 165 L. Ed. 2d 977 (No. 05-273), 
the district court correctly noted that the Eleventh Circuit did not consider or rely on evidence of patent invalidity in either Valley 
Drug or Schering-Plough. Cipro II, 363 F. Supp. 2d at 525, 529. "
1254,13," At oral argument, the appellants emphasized that Mylan  [**42] was delayed for two-and-a-half years in filing its ANDA and 
challenging the patents because it believed that Barr was entitled to the 180-day exclusivity period. Oral Arg. at 5:56-6:29, 6:49-
7:02, available at http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oralarguments/mp3/2008-1097.mp3. They further asserted that because of the 
delay, none of the generic challengers raised the issue of inequitable conduct. Id. at 7:05-7:57."
1254,14," Although the Agreements apparently did contain a provision preserving the option for Barr to reamend to a Paragraph IV 
ANDA (presumptively for the purpose of reclaiming the 180-day exclusivity period) if the '444 patent was subsequently declared 
by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision does not change the analysis. Under the FDA regulations in effect at the 
time of the Agreements, the first generic manufacturer was not entitled to the 180-day exclusivity period unless it had satisfied "
1255,," the successful defense requirement. Furthermore, since the option was never exercised, there was no evidence of an actual 
adverse effect on competition due to that provision. See Clorox, 117 F.3d at 56. "
1257,1," EchoStar is the principal plaintiff in this matter. Accordingly, where appropriate, the Court refers to plaintiffs collectively as 
""EchoStar."""
1257,2," NDS is the principal defendant in this matter. Accordingly, where appropriate, the Court refers to defendants collectively as 
""NDS."" "
1272,1," Melissa J. Baily has filed at least four declarations related to the motions that are the subject of this order. The court refers to 
them as follows: Decl. of Melissa J. Baily In Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Submit Additional Expert Disclosure (""Baily 
I""); Second Decl. of Melissa J. Baily In Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Submit Additional Expert Disclosure (""Baily II""); 
Decl. of Melissa J. Baily In Support of Plaintiffs' Opposition to NAVTEQ's Motion to Strike Declarations in Support of Plaintiffs 
Opposition to NAVTEQ's Motions for Partial Summary Judgment (""Baily III""); and Decl. of Melissa J. Baily in Support of Plaintiffs' 
Opposition to NAVTEQ's Motions for Partial Summary Judgment (""Baily IV""). "
1273,2," Megan E. Gervase has  [*6] also filed a number of declarations related to the motions that are the subject of this order. The 
court refers to them as follows: Decl. of Megan E. Gervase In Support of Defendant NAVTEQ Corp.'s Opposition to Plaintiffs' 
Motion for Leave to Submit Additional Expert Disclosure (""Gervase I""); Decl. of Megan E. Gervase In Support of Defendant 
NAVTEQ Corp.'s Motion to Strike Declarations in Support of Plaintiffs' Opposition (""Gervase II""); and Decl. of Megan E. Gervase 
In Support of Defendant NAVTEQ Corp.'s Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims Other Than Tying (""Gervase III""). "
1275,3," Tele Atlas' excerpts from the Garmin 30(b)(6) deposition do not reveal the date of the deposition. It appears from another letter 
that the deposition was scheduled for June 1, 2007. See Baily III, Ex. 3. If two months in fact elapsed between the two events, 
Tele Atlas does not appear to have been especially diligent in resolving the problems that arose at the deposition. "
1276,4," NAVTEQ also faults Tele Atlas for failing to properly disclose Steven Notaro as a person with knowledge pursuant to Rule 26. 
Because the court finds that the only relevant paragraphs of Mr. Notaro's declaration are inadmissible hearsay, it does not reach 
this issue. "
1277,5," Because this matter arises on two motions for summary judgment, the court draws these background facts from the 
declarations submitted by the parties, deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories and undisputed facts. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
56(e). HN6[
] The court considers this evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, i.e., Tele Atlas. However, 
the court does not credit material submitted with declarations that would not be admissible at trial. See Canada v. Blain's 
Helicopters, Inc., 831 F.2d 920, 925 (9th Cir. 1987). NAVTEQ complains generally that Tele Atlas's opposition ""engages in subterfuge,"" ""makes assertions unsupported  [*21] by the 
record . . . cross-references nonexistent evidence, and engages in more factual overstatements than could possibly be corrected 
by this reply."" NAVTEQ does not, however, specifically object to any portion of the record other than the issues discussed above 
and Baily IV, Exhibit 80 (discussed infra). This raises the issue of whether the trial court may exclude evidence as inadmissible absent an objection. Some Ninth Circuit 
authority suggests that it is an abuse of discretion to exclude evidence from the record on summary judgment absent an 
objection. Fonseca v. Sysco Food Services of Arizona, Inc., 374 F.3d 840, 846-47 (9th Cir. 2004). Other authority emphasizes 
that a trial court may only consider admissible evidence. Orr v. Bank of America, NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir. 2002). It 
is unclear in Orr whether the opposing party objected to every exhibit lodged by the plaintiff, or if the trial court sua sponte made 
evidentiary rulings excluding all but three exhibits. See id. The court does not resolve this tension because it is not necessary to 
do so to decide these motions. The court therefore strikes only evidence to which NAVTEQ has properly objected. Nevertheless, 
the  [*22] court notes that many exhibits lodged by Tele Atlas in support of its opposition are flagrant hearsay. "
1278,6," Mr. Ribbink's receipt of the letter appears to predate NAVTEQ's agreement with Philips, as well as the beginning of the 
licensing negotiations between NAVTEQ and Philips. In fact, the letter appears to have been sent to TomTom  [*25] on 
December 17, 2003. See Baily IV, Ex. 42. "
1279,7," Brunswick New Technologies purchased a controlling stake in Navman at some point before December 2003. Baily IV, Ex. 64 
at 3, 11. "
1280,8," The court sustains NAVTEQ's objection to the obvious hearsay in Exhibit 80. It is not the only hearsay polluting the record in 
this case. A non-exhaustive list comprises exhibits 62, 63, 65, 68, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 79, 81 and 90 from the Baily IV declaration. 
All raise obvious hearsay concerns, but NAVTEQ has not specifically objected to their presence in the record."
1280,9," Tele Atlas also submits an email from Brunswick New Technologies' general counsel to NAVTEQ. Id., Ex. 68. This email is 
inadmissible hearsay, and the court grants it no weight. The same email also appears in the record as Exhibit 72 to the Baily IV 
declaration. "
1281,10," It seems unlikely that the slide show submitted by Tele Atlas as evidence was the actual presentation given by NAVTEQ to 
Samsung. For example, slide 13 of the presentation is blank except for the header ""Map Update."" Id. at NVT-TA829705. Slide 
46 explains that the [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] is discussed on ""slide 39,"" but slide 39 does not discuss [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT]. Id. at NVT-TA829731; NVT-TA829738. However, it is a reasonable inference on summary 
judgment that the slides were presented and that the completed slides were not  [*33] changed before the presentation."
1281,11," Tele Atlas also submits that DeCarta has previously used Tele Atlas data and that DeCarta exclusively used NAVTEQ data 
after entering the patent and map data license agreements. Nothing in the cited exhibits (comprising in total the patent license 
and the map data license) provides evidentiary support for either inference."
1281,12," Tele Atlas cites Exhibit 89, a string of internal NAVTEQ emails, for the proposition that ""Via Michelin agreed to purchase data 
exclusively from NAVTEQ."" No such inference is possible from the email, which noted that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
Id. "
1282,13," With respect to the Electronic Horizon patent, the court grants NAVTEQ's motion for summary judgment, as Tele Atlas has 
submitted no evidence to support its allegation that NAVTEQ tied the Electronic Horizon patent to the a map data license, let 
alone any evidence that NAVTEQ ever licensed the Electronic Horizon patent. "
1283,14," The document appears to be a spreadsheet of NAVTEQ's payments to Phillips. It bears a NAVTEQ Bates stamp, permitting 
the court to infer that it is authentic and that it is an admission pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(A). "
1285,15, NAVTEQ's motion does not challenge Tele Atlas' definition of the relevant technology markets. 
1286,16," Tele Atlas also submits various market share calculations conducted by Dr. Neels and disclosed in his ""rebuttal"" report. The 
court declined to grant Tele Atlas leave to submit this report and does not consider Dr. Neels' report. Even if it had, it is not 
certain whether this evidence would have sustained Tele Atlas's burden.  [*51] See Hynix Semiconductor, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
777, 2008 WL 73689, *9 (explaining how a patent holder with 100% share of a technology market could often lack market 
power)."
1286,17," Tele Atlas also states that ""although Tele Atlas has considered the option of offering such indemnification [for users of its 
workaround] to blunt the force of the tie, it has never done so."" Tele Atlas argues that this unwillingness to indemnify supports its 
position that there are no viable substitutes to the 3D patents' technology. To support this proposition, Tele Atlas cites deposition 
testimony that Tele Atlas has [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Baily IV, Ex. 169 at 127:18-20. It is entirely unclear that the 
cited testimony has anything to do with the 3D patents. On the other hand, the testimony of George Fink is that [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] See Johnstone Decl., Ex. H at 53:18-21. "
1287,18," Tele Atlas submits a slideshow titled ""NAVTEQ Software Business Overview"" from April 2006. Baily IV, Ex. 97. One slide 
explains that ""[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]"" Id. at NVT-TA 120647. Tele Atlas cites to this document in its discussion of 
NAVTEQ's map data licensing contracts for [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. The presentation, which is about NAVTEQ's 
software business, not its map data business, is irrelevant. To the extent it is relevant, it hurts Tele Atlas's case because it 
suggests that NAVTEQ needed to convert its map data customers into software customers because it was too easy to switch to 
Tele Atlas data. "
1288,19," Tele Atlas also submits a ""TA/GDT Merger Study"" comprised of findings from an interview with a NAVTEQ employee to 
support the proposition that Tele Atlas and NAVTEQ offered similar quality data while NAVTEQ  [*58] charged substantially 
more. Baily IV, Ex. 132. While the document comes from NAVTEQ's files, the court cannot find, based on the evidence supplied 
by Tele Atlas, that the document was more likely than not prepared by a NAVTEQ employee or agent. It appears more likely that 
the document was prepared by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice in evaluating the impact of Tele 
Atlas's purchase of GDT. Accordingly, the document does not appear to be exempt from the hearsay rule pursuant to 
801(d)(2)(A) and is inadmissible based upon the current record. The court does not strike the exhibit, however, because it does 
not impact the court's ruling on the relevant portions of the summary judgment motions."
1288,20," Mr. Vu states that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. Vu Decl. P 5. According to Mr. Vu, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE 
COURT]. See id. "
1290,21," Tele Atlas also submits evidence that NAVTEQ [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] by entering into contracts with Circuit 
City and Best Buy. As a factual matter, these attempts appear to have failed in that NAVTEQ's promotional deal with Best Buy 
appears to have lasted only six months and NAVTEQ's deal with Circuit City never materialized. Nonetheless, Tele  [*65] Atlas 
fails to explain how this conduct violated section 1."
1290,22," HN14[
] Because Tele Atlas has failed to produce evidence that NAVTEQ possessed market power in the tying technology markets, its rule of reason claims under section 1 based on the alleged tying also fail. Illinois Tool Works, 547 U.S. 28, 42-43, 
126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26. "
1292,23," Analogously,  [*75] Tele Atlas's claim under California Business & Professions Code § 17200 survives. "
1297,1," The sale agreement was later amended to specify that Top Enterprise, LLC would lease the Brooklawn Station and Top Speed 
Gas, LLC would purchase the Cherry Hill Station. Mr. Top controlled both entities. "
1298,2," Defendants' statement that ""Top Speed never sold non-BP products at the Cherry Hill Premises"" (Def. Br. at 8) is curious, since 
Defendant  [*4] admitted to this Court in a previous proceeding that he ""had no other option than to begin selling unbranded 
gasoline [at the Cherry Hill Station]. It was a matter of financial survival."" BP Products North America, Inc. v, Top Speed Gas, 
LLC, slip op., Civ. No. 06-465 (D.N.J. Feb. 23. 2006) (TRO Opinion). "
1299,3," In their Reply Brief, Defendants make a perfunctory attempt at preserving the applicability of their motion to this monetary issue 
by reciting a few conclusory sentences (only after Plaintiff's Opposition Brief noted the absence of argumentation on these 
issues). (Def. Resp. Br. at 12.) The Court is not persuaded by this superficial effort. However, to the extent Defendant seeks to 
challenge the Court's calculation of attorney's fees awarded in the judgment, the Court leaves open the possibility that 
Defendants may, pursuant to Rule 60, move to modify the fee award contained in the judgment. See, e.g., Weitzman v. Stein, 
908 F. Supp. 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). "
1300,4," Defendants also remark that ""the Court must decide"" whether the exchange of considerations was equitable. [Def. Mot. Br. at 
31.] Defendants offer no reasons why the Court might determine the exchange of considerations to be unreasonable, however. 
 [*11] Based on the information before it, the Court has no reason to doubt the fairness of the exchange of considerations for 
which Defendants and Plaintiff bargained."
1300,5," The Court need not reach the question of whether the restrictive covenant is a ""tying arrangement."" Plaintiff argues that it is 
not, because Defendants are not required to sell Plaintiff's brand of gasoline; they are only barred from selling other brands of 
gasoline. (Defendants could, in compliance with the covenant, operate another sort of business altogether on the properties.) 
(Pl. Op. Br. at 28.) The Court merely holds that the restrictive covenant, whether or not a tying arrangement, is well within the 
range of permissible covenants. "
1301,6," If lease assignment contracts were not enforceable by assignors, as Defendants argue, then assignors could never seek 
indemnification for an assignee's non-payment of rent. As is well established, if an assignee fails to pay rent, the assignor 
remains liable to the landlord; however, because the assignor and assignee are in privity of contract, the assignor can seek 
indemnification from the assignee. Friedman, supra, at § 7:5.1. This illustrates that Defendants' premise -- that an assignor has 
no enforceable rights under the assignment contract -- is clearly incorrect. "
1308,*," District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana, sitting by designation."
1308,1," The summary judgment briefing included defendants Nokia, Motorola, T-Mobile, Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Lucent. 
Subsequently the district court entered dismissals as to T-Mobile and Nokia, so the only appellees to this action are Motorola, 
Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Lucent (""Appellees""). "
1311,2," Accordingly, though we affirm  [**14] the district court's ruling, our opinion should not be construed to endorse its conclusion 
that if GBT had shown an agreement in restraint of trade, the Appellees' conduct would be considered per se illegal. A proper 
review of that conclusion would consider whether it conflicts with Consol. Metal Prods., where we held that a standard setting 
organization's decision not to certify a particular product did not pe se violate Sherman Act § 1. See 846 F.2d at 292. "
1319,*," This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under  [**2] the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and 
collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. "
1321,1, It is undisputed that we look to Colorado for the governing law. 
1322,2," Because we conclude that PDI had no legal obligation to present proof regarding ProLease's knowledge of the specific 
potential purchaser, we need not reach ProLease's contentions that (a) there was insufficient evidence of its knowledge of ""other 
suitors""; and (b) it cannot be held liable for tortious interference because it did not know of the prospective contract with Global 
until negotiations had ceased. "
1323,3," Although we may review summary judgment rulings based purely on legal questions after final judgment, we may not review 
denials of summary judgment based on factual disputes. See Kelley, 542 F.3d 802, 2008 WL 4238967, at *13; Wolfgang v. Mid-
Am. Motorsports, Inc., 111 F.3d 1515, 1521 (10th Cir. 1997). Appellate review of an improperly denied motion  [**16] for 
summary judgment on the facts is confined to subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law: Because of this critical distinction . . . prudent counsel will not rely on their own interpretations of whether an issue is purely 
a question of law or fact. Out of an abundance of caution, . . . counsel should renew summary judgment grounds in a Rule 
50 motion . . . at the close of all the evidence, and again, . . . after the jury has returned a verdict . . . . Wolfgang, 111 F.3d at 1521. Failure to move for judgment as a matter of law on an issue of fact at the conclusion of the 
evidence precludes review of the issue except for ""the most manifest error."" Smith v. Nw. Fin. Acceptance, Inc., 129 F.3d 1408, 
1415-16 (10th Cir. 1997); see Kelley, 542 F.3d 802, 2008 WL 4238967, at *13. "
1324,4," One commentator has suggested that the PRE Court's reliance on the malicious prosecution analogy, and particularly the 
probable cause concept, imports a subjective feature into the objective-baselessness inquiry because the court is called upon to 
assess what the litigant actually knew or should have known, or believed to be true. See Brunell, supra, at 34-35 (""[B]y relying on 
the malicious prosecution analogy, the Court has incorporated an element of subjectivity into the 'objective' baselessness test. . . 
. [A]n element of subjectivity is inherent in the Court's focus on whether 'a reasonable  [**20] litigant in the defendant's position 
could realistically expect success on the merits of the challenged lawsuit.'"" (quoting PRE, 508 U.S. at 63)). "
1325,5," As ProLease contends, the Maryland district court's grant of summary judgment in PDI's favor is not, in and of itself, 
determinative. The Maryland district court's holding cannot be interpreted as a finding that ProLease's case was objectively 
baseless. Although the court found ProLease's arguments unconvincing, it did not find them baseless. "
1326,6," HN12[
] Generally, we do not consider issues on appeal that were not presented to the district court. Anderson v. Blake, 469 F.3d 910, 918 (10th Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Anderson, 374 F.3d 955, 958 (10th Cir.2004) (""This is not a novel 
concept. We have held . . . that a party may not raise on appeal specific theories he did not present before the district judge.""). 
""The failure to raise the issue with the trial court precludes review except for the most manifest error."" Hicks v. Gates Rubber 
Co., 928 F.2d 966, 970 (10th Cir. 1991)."
1326,7," ProLease did not include its proposed jury instructions in its appendices, nor were they included in the appendices of PDI. 
Accordingly, we may only  [**29] draw clues regarding the contents of those instructions from other pieces of the record. It was 
ProLease's obligation to provide us with an adequate record for review. See Milligan-Hitt v. Board of Trustees of Sheridan 
County School Dist. No. 2, 523 F.3d 1219, 1231 (10th Cir. 2008) (""If the appendix and its supplements are not sufficient to 
decide an issue, we have no obligation to go further and examine documents that should have been included, and we regularly 
refuse to hear claims predicated on record evidence not in the appendix."")."
1326,8," Arguably, ProLease should be categorically barred from availing itself of plain error review because (without reserving an 
objection concerning the sham litigation standard) it endeavored to influence the content of the court's legally protected interest 
instruction and proposed a version of such an instruction. Specifically, in doing so, ProLease arguably waived (as opposed to 
forfeited) an objection to the court's decision to give an instruction embodying the legally protected interest privilege that would 
have been predicated  [**31] on the alleged shortcomings of that standard to protect its First Amendment rights. Cf. Aves By and 
Through Aves v. Shah, 997 F.2d 762, 766 (10th Cir. 1993) (""Dr. Shah urges a review for plain error. Under the circumstances, 
we decline to do so. 'A party who requests an instruction invites any error contained therein and, absent an objection before the 
instruction is given, waives appellate review of the correctness of the instruction.'"" (quoting Gilchrist v. Jim Slemons Imports, "
1327,," Inc., 803 F.2d 1488, 1493 (9th Cir. 1986))); see also Northern Nat. Gas Co. v. Trans Pacific Oil Corp., 248 F. App'x 882, 888 
(10th Cir. 2007) (""Northern did not object to the Special Verdict Form after it was read and submitted to the jury or seek 
clarification of the verdict before the jury was dismissed. It cannot now assert the form was flawed.""); see generally United States 
v. Carrasco-Salazar, 494 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting that ""a party that has forfeited a right by failing to make a 
proper objection may obtain relief for plain error; but a party that has waived a right is not entitled to appellate relief"" (internal 
quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). We need not, however, decide this  [**32] point. As noted infra, ProLease has not 
otherwise demonstrated the existence of circumstances that would trigger our plain error review."
1327,9," ProLease's Rule 50(b) motion argued that its interference with PDI's prospective contracts was privileged under the legally 
 [**33] protected interest privilege, claiming that the evidence showed that it ""had good reason to believe that the Letter of Intent 
. . . constituted a binding agreement"" or, in the alternative, that the LOI ""obligated the parties to negotiate the sale in good faith."" 
Aplt. App. at 856. However, although ProLease moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of PDI's case-in-chief under 
Rule 50(a), it did not raise in this motion a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge concerning the legally protected interest 
privilege. The district court determined that ProLease's failure to raise this issue in a Rule 50(a) motion constituted a waiver of 
any challenge to ""the jury's findings related to their privilege defense."" Aplt. App. at 889. We agree with the district court that 
ProLease waived any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the legally protected interest privilege. See Marshall 
v. Columbia Lea Reg'l Hosp., 474 F.3d 733, 738-39 (10th Cir. 2007) (HN15[
] ""The renewed motion under Rule 50(b) cannot assert grounds for relief not asserted in the original motion."")."
1327,10," In considering ProLease's evidentiary objections, the district court took judicial notice of both the Maryland district court's 
memorandum opinion and the case of Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance v. Shady Grove Plaza Partnership, 734 F. Supp. 1181 (D. 
Md. 1990). HN18[
] Judicial notice of facts is distinct from judicial notice of law. See Getty Petroleum Mktg., Inc. v. Capital Terminal Co., 391 F.3d 312, 321-22 (1st Cir. 2004) (Lipez, C.J., concurring). Judicial notice of facts ""is an adjudicative device 
that alleviates the parties' evidentiary duties at trial, serving as 'a substitute for the conventional method of taking evidence to "
1328,," establish facts.'"" York v. AT&T, 95 F.3d 948, 958 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Grand Opera Co. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film 
Corp., 235 F.2d 303, 307 (7th Cir. 1956)). In contrast, judicial notice of law is ""the commonsense doctrine that the rules of 
 [**36] evidence governing admissibility and proof of documents generally do not make sense to apply to statutes or judicial 
opinions--which are technically documents--because they are presented to the court as law, not to the jury as evidence."" Getty 
Petroleum Mktg., Inc., 391 F.3d at 322. The district court can judicially notice a matter of law as a matter of fact, ""i.e., the court 
can look to the law not as a rule governing the case before it but as a social fact with evidential consequences."" City of Wichita v. 
U.S. Gypsum Co., 72 F.3d 1491, 1496 (10th Cir. 1996). Thus, the law allows the district court to take judicial notice of opinions 
and case law from other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding, the district court in this case actually admitted the documents at issue 
into evidence, negating the efficacy of judicial notice as a device to establish disputed facts."
1328,11," The rule provides: HN19[
] ""Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed 
by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of 
time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. Prior to trial, ProLease objected that both documents 
constituted inadmissible hearsay. Because ProLease does not raise this argument on appeal, we deem it to be waived. See 
Wyoming v. Livingston, 443 F.3d 1211, 1216 (10th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1019, 127 S. Ct. 553, 166 L. Ed. 2d 409 
(2006); Silverton Snowmobile Club v. U.S. Forest Serv., 433 F.3d 772, 783 (10th Cir. 2006)."
1328,12," ProLease's additional argument that  [**38] the judicial opinions were cumulative in light of the jury instructions that informed 
the jury that a prior determination had been made that it had no legally protected interest may be summarily rejected. As PDI 
rightly notes, as relevant here, HN20[
] Rule 403's concern is evidence that is cumulative of other evidence. See, e.g., Joseph v. Terminix Intern. Co., 17 F.3d 1282, 1284-85 (10th Cir. 1994). Jury instructions are not evidence. Accordingly, ProLease's 
argument is wholly without merit. "
1330,13," Section 5-12-102 provides: HN23[
] (1) Except as provided in section 13-21-101, C.R.S., when there is no agreement as to the rate thereof, creditors shall receive interest as follows: (a) When money or property has been wrongfully withheld, interest shall be an amount which fully recognizes the gain 
or benefit realized by the person withholding such money or property from the date of the wrongful withholding to the 
date of payment or to the date judgment is entered, whichever first occurs; or, at the election of the claimant, (b) Interest shall be at the rate of eight percent per annum compounded  [**47] annually for all moneys or the value of 
all property after they are wrongfully withheld or after they become due to the date of payment or to the date judgment 
is entered, whichever first occurs. "
1331,14," We find PDI's cited authority inapposite. The cases on which PDI relied to demonstrate the mandatory nature of the statute--
James v. Coors Brewing Co., 73 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1254 (D. Colo. 1999), and Todd v. Bear Valley Village Apts., 980 P.2d 973, 
980-81 (Colo. 1999)--interpret § 13-21-101(1), which provides, in personal injury cases, ""it is the duty of the court in entering 
judgment for the plaintiff,"" to add interest to the damages award. COLO. REV. STAT. § 13-21-101(1) (emphasis added). 
According to these courts, the emphasized language mandates an award of prejudgment interest in every personal injury case. 
Section 5-12-102 does not contain the operative language of section 13-21-101(1). "
1332,15," Similar to the district court in this case, the district court in Echo Acceptance Corp. awarded less than the prejudgment interest 
to which the prevailing party was due because of the length of time during which prejudgment interest accrued. We rejected this 
approach stating ""we are constrained by the statute"" to award interest calculated at the statutory rate. Echo Acceptance Corp., 
267 F.3d at 1082. We likewise reject the district court's identical rationale for refusing to award PDI prejudgment interest here."
1332,16," PDI maintains that it is entitled to interest calculated from the date on which ProLease filed its breach of contract action. We 
disagree. Even if we were to find that PDI was ""wronged"" when ProLease filed its action, the ""wrongful withholding"" undeniably 
occurred on August 27, 1999, which is ""when [PDI's] injury is measured."" Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 193 P.3d 821, 2008 WL

1339,3," The parties also disagree as to whether Analogix pled both attempted monopolization and monopolization. Because Analogix 
will be granted leave to file an amended complaint, the Court expresses no opinion as to this issue."

not allege expressly the elements of fraud. Analogix may attempt to plead a fraud claim in its amended complaint. "
1343,1," As Desotech points out, 3DS did not couch its motion in the language of ""good cause."" The motion does argue, however, that a 
stay should be granted because of the lopsided discovery burdens imposed by the antitrust portion of this case--in other words, 
good cause. To deny defendants' motion because it failed to invoke the ""good cause"" label in its opening motion would elevate 
form over substance, a position this court declines to take."
1343,2," Although the interrogatories given to the court in the cited exhibit were offered in support of 3DS's motion to bifurcate trial on 
the patent claims, Desotech admits in its memorandum opposing that motion that many of its discovery requests go to both the 
antitrust counts and the patent counts. Pl.'s Memo Opp. to Mot. to Bifurcate (Dkt. No. 53), at 2."
1343,3," Of course, these burdens on 3DS will not bar such discovery if Desotech's complaint survives, in whole or in part, the motion to 
dismiss that is currently pending. In that case, discovery would continue and the parties would generally have to rely on 
protective orders and other discovery tools to safeguard confidential information. "
1344,4," The court is mindful that 3DS has thus far taken it upon itself, without court approval, to withhold discovery on these claims and 
cautions 3DS to ensure that it complies with Desotech's legitimate discovery requests moving forward. The court also 
recognizes, however, that the purpose of the present motion almost certainly would have been frustrated had 3DS fully complied 
with all of Desotech's discovery requests up to this point. "

would have to identify damages and apportion ""them among directly victimized contractors and subcontractors  [**27] and

U.S.C.A. § 717 et seq.] and the jurisdiction of the Commission under such Act shall not apply to any natural gas solely by 
reason of any first sale of such natural gas. …."
1383,5," 15 U.S.C.A. § 3301(21) defines ""first sale"" as follows: HN9[
] (A) General rule "
1384,," The term ""first sale"" means any sale of any volume of natural gas- (i) to any interstate pipeline or intrastate pipeline; (ii) to any local distribution company; (iii) to any person for use by such person; (iv) which precedes any sale described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii); and (v) which precedes or follows any sale described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) and is defined by the Commission as a first 
sale in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this chapter. (B) Certain sales not included Clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall not include the sale of any  [*13] volume of natural gas by any 
interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any affiliate thereof, unless such sale is attributable 
to volumes of natural gas produced by such interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any 
affiliate thereof. "
1385,6," The court explained that HN10[
] ""[a] wash trade is a transaction where two parties simultaneously buy and sell the same 
quantity of natural gas at the same price and on the same day,"" which creates a false appearance of demand for and short 
supply of natural gas. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 503 F.3d at 1032, n.3. "
1386,7," To the extent the Natural Gas Companies present additional arguments on appeal, regarding statutory construction and also 
the doctrine of preemption as it relates to ""first sales,"" we find their arguments without merit for the reasons discussed by the 
Ninth Circuit in E. & J. Gallo Winery, 503 F.3d at 1046-47. In particular, we agree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that state 
antitrust and fair competition laws complement, rather than undermine, Congress' intent to move toward a less regulated natural 
gas market. Id. at 1046. Therefore, we find this case distinguishable from Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil 
and Gas Bd. of Mississippi, 474 U.S. 409, 422, 106 S. Ct. 709, 88 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1986),  [*24] where the regulations at issue

required by this rule, shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted. An assertion of fact set forth in a statement of 
material facts shall be followed by a citation to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the 
assertion. The court  [**3] may disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material

1400,4," Ticket Center also provides evidence of promotional material advertising a discount on the ticket price when purchased through

matter asserted (i.e., that Banco Popular conditioned its provision of financial services and advertising placement on use of 
TicketPop's ticketing services). See Finn v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 782 F.2d 13, 16, n.4 (1st Cir. 1986)."
1405,11," While Mr. Grau's testimony may be admissible at trial in order to impeach Mr. Jover's testimony or to refresh Mr. Jover's 
memory of the statement, Fed. R. Evid. 613, 612, it would be inadmissible under Rule 801(d)(1) to prove the truth of the matter 
asserted (i.e., that Banco Popular conditioned its provision of financial services on Casa de los Tapes acting as a TicketPop 
outlet). See Finn, 782 F.2d at 16, n.4. "
1406,12," While Mr. Otero Caballero's testimony may be admissible at trial in order to impeach Mr. Martinez Souss's testimony or to 
refresh Mr. Martinez Souss's memory of the statement, Fed. R. Evid. 613, 612, it would be inadmissible under Rule 801(d)(1) to 
prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that Banco Popular conditioned its sponsorship of the Torneo on the use of TicketPop 
services). See Finn, 782 F.2d at 16, n.4. "
1409,13," Ticket Center cites only to its own pleadings in the state court proceedings, not to any ""competent knowledge."" Libertad, 53 
F.3d at 435."
1409,14," The only record evidence in support of this assertion is the declaration of Mr. A. Grau, which is not based on personal 
knowledge in violation of Rule 56(e), and an untranslated copy of Spanish-language advertisements announcing ticket prices, 
which fails to comply with the requirement of Local Rule 10(b) that Spanish language documents be accompanied with an 
English translation. Moreover, even if these pieces of evidence were admissible, none of them contains facts suggesting that the 
prices were anti-competitive or in any way illegal. "
1410,15," Based on the disposition of Banco Popular's motion for summary judgment, I do not need to reach Banco Popular's 
supplemental motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment (Docket No. 217). "
1412,1," On November 30, 2007, this Court issued an Order dismissing Count Eight of Venali's amended counterclaim and third party 
complaint. "
1413,2," Venali originally filed the SACC by stipulation on August 20, 2008. See Docket Nos. 133 & 134. Catch Curve filed this motion 
for summary judgment based on the SACC on August 22, 2008. See Docket No. 137. Because of a filing deficiency, the SACC 
was stricken on August 27, 2008. See Docket No. 140. With leave from the Court, Venali fixed this deficiency by lodging the 
SACC on October 3, 2008. See Docket No. 167. The Court considers this Motion for Summary Judgment with reference to that pleading. Because the parties have submitted 
their papers on the assumption that the SACC is the operative pleading, the Court considers this motion properly before it."
1413,3," In discussing the parties' arguments in support of the current motion, the Court refers to Catch Curve and j2 collectively as 
""Catch Curve."" "
1415,4," Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 690 F.2d 1240, 1253 (9th Cir. 1982), decided a decade prior to 
PRE, is not to the contrary. The court's statement that ""[w]hether something is a genuine effort to influence government action, 
or a mere sham, is a question of fact"" referred to the immunity inquiry as a whole. Here, the Court looks only to objective 
baselessness, an inquiry more suited to disposition on summary judgment than the subjective prong of PRE. Cf. Thermalloy, 
935 F. Supp. at 66."
1415,5," The Claim Construction Order, issued on May 11, 2007, is Docket Entry 81. "
1418,6," Repeated early settlements may not prevent an antitrust plaintiff from piercing Noerr-Pennington immunity through the USS-
POSCO approach in all cases. For example, this case might be different if Venali had presented evidence, rather than simply 
argument, that Catch Curve had secured its licenses by inappropriate means. Although its papers suggest anticompetitive 
conduct in securing licenses, Venali has not supplemented its arguments that Catch Curve repeatedly settled for less than the 
cost of litigation with, for example, evidence that its licenses were secured by threats aside from the pressure inevitably exerted 
by the looming possibility of litigation expenses. Venali has presented a complaint from the Northern District of Georgia alleging 
that j2 decided to sue the antitrust plaintiff for patent infringement after that plaintiff refused j2's offer for purchase. O'Keefe Decl. 
Ex. I. Notably, however, Venali has not provided any testimony regarding the improper nature of licensing. "
1419,7," To show that these cases were filed without regard to the merits, Venali also cites to the patent claims and prosecution history, 
as well as what it construes as inconsistent litigation positions from when j2 was defending a suit against the prior patent owner. 
The Court finds the reasonable inferences flowing from these arguments insufficient, even when construed in Venali's favor, to 
create a genuine issue as to whether these cases were filed ""without regard to the merits"": the former arguments derive primarily 
from the Court's resolution of the claim construction matters, while the latter is typical in litigation, particularly at the early stages. 
Even drawing the inferences regarding j2's prior litigation position in favor of Venali, undisputed evidence -- that j2 paid a not 
insubstantial license fee and purchased the patents -- squarely points in the other direction. Venali's other evidence and 
arguments do not address whether litigation was filed ""without regard for the merits,"" but rather whether it was ""for the purpose 
of injuring a market rival."" See 31 F.3d at 811. "
1429,1," Because the court has ruled that plaintiff has failed to state a viable antitrust claim under the Sherman Act, defendant's 
argument that the Released Rate Program adopted to comply with Carmack is immune from antitrust liability is not addressed 
herein. "
1449,1," Plaintiffs have filed a second amended complaint adding two defendants that do not manufacture vitamin C. Defendants have 
moved to dismiss the second amended complaint."
1449,2," There are multiple complaints in this consolidated multi-district litigation action, but all recite essentially the same background 
facts. "
1451,3," The Ministry was formerly known as the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (""MOFTEC""). Both entities will be 
referred to as the Ministry herein."
1451,4," A plurality of the Supreme Court has recognized a commercial exception to the act of state doctrine, pursuant to which ""the 
concept of an act of state should not be extended to include the repudiation of a purely commercial obligation owed by a foreign 
sovereign or by one of its commercial instrumentalities."" Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. The Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, 
695, 96 S. Ct. 1854, 48 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976). The Second Circuit, however, has not adopted this exception. See Braka v. 
Bancomer, S.N.C., 762 F.2d 222, 225 (2d Cir. 1985) (""We leave for another day consideration of the possible existence in this 
Circuit of a commercial exception to the act of state doctrine under Dunhill.""). Even if the exception were recognized within this 
Circuit, defendants and the Ministry have made a compelling argument for why the Chinese government's involvement - to the 
extent it exists - in defendants' price-fixing scheme amounts to a public, rather than commercial, act. Namely, they argue that the 
government was working to guide the vitamin C industry in China's transition  [**15] from a command to a market economy. If 
so, and if - as defendants and the Ministry argue - defendants were acting in a governmental capacity when they fixed prices, it 
is not even clear that the Sherman Act would apply, as it is directed at private actors. "
1452,5," The factors given by the Ninth Circuit in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N.T. & S.A., 549 F.2d 597, 614 (9th Cir. 
1976) are: [1] the degree of conflict with foreign law or policy, [2] the nationality or allegiance of the parties and the locations or principal places of businesses or corporations, [3] the extent to which enforcement by either state can be expected to achieve compliance, [4] the relative significance of effects on the United States as compared with those elsewhere, [5] the extent to which there is explicit purpose to harm or affect American commerce, [6] the foreseeability of such  [**17] effect, and [7] the relative importance to the violations charged of conduct within the United States as compared with conduct abroad. The factors listed by the Third Circuit in Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1297-98 (3d Cir. 1979) are:"
1452,1, . Degree of conflict with foreign law or policy;
1452,2, . Nationality of the parties;
1452,3, . Relative importance of the alleged violation of conduct here compared to that abroad;
1452,4, . Availability of a remedy abroad and the pendency of litigation there;
1452,5, . Existence of intent to harm or affect American commerce and its foreseeability;
1452,6, . Possible effect upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief;
1452,7," . If relief is granted, whether a party will be placed in the position of being forced to perform an act illegal in either country 
or be under conflicting requirements by both countries;"
1452,8, . Whether the court can make its order effective;
1452,9, . Whether an order for relief would be acceptable in this country if made by the foreign nation under similar circumstances;
1452,10, . Whether a treaty with the affected nations has addressed the issue.
1452,6," Defendants assert that courts ""routinely consider, and often grant, dismissal of [similar] cases … at the Rule 12 motion stage,"" 
but they cite only four cases, all of which were decided between 1971 and 1983. Of those four, one was decided after discovery 
was completed, Van Bokkelen v. Grumman Aerospace Corp., 432 F. Supp. 329 (E.D.N.Y. 1977), and three were dismissed 
based on the allegations in the complaint, see Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 410 F. Supp. 10 (S.D.N.Y. 1975); Clayco Petroleum 
Corp. v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 712 F.2d 404 (9th Cir. 1983); Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Buttes Gas & Oil Co., 331 F. 
Supp. 92 (C.D. Cal. 1971). "
1454,7," The Ministry argues that such documents should not be taken at face value. The Ministry argues that many of the terms 
appearing in defendants' and the Chamber's documents have meanings in the context of China's government and economic 
policy that are quite different from their literal translations. Among the controversial terms are ""social organization,"" ""voluntary 
self-restraint,"" ""coordination,"" ""industry self-discipline,"" and ""verification."" "
1455,8," The deponent testified as follows: Q. Does the Chamber review the contracts to determine whether a minimum export price has been met? A. They might, I think they should."
1455,*," * * Q. Are you the main person responsible for negotiating prices of vitamin C with U.S. customers? A. Yes, I handled the very specific processes. I do that. Q. Are you aware of any minimum export price today for vitamin C? A. I think so. I feel that it might be. Q. Do you know what it is? "
1456,, A. I can't recall.
1456,*," * * Q. No one has ever told you that the Chamber won't approve a contract with a price below $ 335 cents, have they? A. I cannot recall. Dep.  [**30] of Ning Hong, at 68-70."
1456,9, Plaintiffs do not describe the source of this document. It bears Bates number JJBA11-1. 
1457,10," The Ministry asserts that if the court exercises jurisdiction over this action ""[i]t cannot be denied that the possibility of insult to 
 [**35] China is significant."" Ministry Br. at 22. Not every court agrees with this basis for abstention. The Ninth Circuit has noted: HN7[
] Federal judges cannot dismiss a case because a foreign government finds it irksome, nor can they tailor their 
rulings to accommodate a non-party . . .. If a foreign government finds the litigation offensive, it may lodge a protest with our 
government; our political branches can then respond in whatever way they deem appropriate - up to an including passing 
legislation…. If courts were to take the interests of foreign governments into account, they would be conducting foreign 
policy by deciding whether it serves our national interests to continue with the litigation…."" Patrickson v. Dole Food Co., Inc., 251 F.3d 795, 803-05 (9th Cir. 2001) (Kozinski, J.). "
1458,11," At oral argument, counsel for the Ministry explained: [T]he laws of the government of China do not have . . . quite the same transparency as the laws of the United States, in the 
sense that there are statute books that are available, that there are lengthy Congressional statements of intent, where you 
can read what the debates were all about. The way the Chinese system operates is that you have the state council and the state council is  [**40] then composed of a 
number of key ministries. The Ministry of Commerce is not some backwater regulator in a small city in China. The Ministry 
of Commerce is the preeminent regulator of the economy, export economy of the People's Republic. Tr. of Mot., June 5, 2007, at 46-47. "
1459,12," One area that appears to be ripe for discovery is the degree to which defendants coordinated pricing before and after 
December 2001. If the apparatus and mandate for price-fixing was in place as of 1991 (when the Chamber was formed) or 1997 
(when the Vitamin C Sub-Committee was formed), but no price-fixing occurred until market power was achieved, plaintiffs would 
have a stronger argument that defendants' actions were voluntary. "
1465,1," The papers submitted in connection with this motion include Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Class Action 
Complaint (""Compl.""); Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Complaint; Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs' Opposition in  [**9] Response to Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss; and Defendants' Joint Reply to Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs' Opposition in Response to Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss. "
1466,2," The direct purchaser plaintiffs are represented by Dust Pro, Inc.; Carter Distributing Company; Strates Shows, Inc.; US 
Magnesium LLC; Zinifex Taylor Chemicals, Inc.; Donnelly Commodities, Inc.; Dakota Granite Company; and Cedar Creek 
Wholesale, Inc. "
1468,3," The Court notes the concern expressed in Twombly that district courts not ""forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be 
expensive."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1966. Yet as sensitive as courts must be to the cost to litigants of 
discovery, where plaintiffs have made out a plausible antitrust claim, as they have here, they are entitled to discovery in order to 
determine to what relief, if any, they are entitled. See id. at 1965 (""Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not 
impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that 
discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.""). "
1469,4," When considering an antitrust complaint, the allegations ""cannot be compartmentalized and considered in isolation 'as if they 
were separate lawsuits, thereby overlooking the conspiracy claim itself.'"" Jung v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d 
119, 155 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 685 F.2d 810, 822 (3d Cir. 1982)). Twombly did not change this 
principle: ""[T]he character and effect of a [Sherman Act] conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its 
separate parts."" In re Southeastern Milk Antitrust Litig., 555 F. Supp. 2d at 943-44  [**21] (quoting Continental Ore Co. v. Union 
Carbide and Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962)). "
1471,5," While the Court is not, of course, bound by the STB opinion, the STB's findings, and the logic underlying them, reinforces the 
Court's view that plaintiffs' claims  [**30] are plausible."
1471,6," Plaintiffs do not allege that defendants coerced one another to assure adherence to the AIILF. It is enough, however, that they 
have alleged an agreement and coordinated use of the mechanism to restrain trade. See United States v. National Ass'n of 
Broadcasters, 536 F. Supp. 149, 163 (D.D.C. 1982)  [**31] (""[I]t is well established that the parties to an agreement which per se 
violates the antitrust laws may not defend on the basis that they have applied no coercion to bring about adherence to the 
combination or to compel obedience to its terms."") "
1475,1," Insignia attempts to base its motion on Rule 15(a), however, once a court has entered a Rule 16 scheduling order, the court 
may properly require that good cause (and not the more liberal Rule 15 standard) be shown for motions to amend that are 
""substantially out of time."" In re Milk Prods. Antitrust Litig., 195 F.3d 430, 438 (8th Cir. 1999). ""If we considered only Rule 15(a) 
without regard to Rule 16(b), we would render scheduling orders meaningless and effectively would read Rule 16(b) and its good 
cause requirement out of the Federal Rules.""). Id."
1475,2," Local Rule 16.3 reinforces the need for a party to show good cause when seeking to extend a pretrial deadline as the rule is 
""intended to discourage modifying pretrial schedules unless good cause has been shown."" Local Rule 16.3 advisory committee 
notes."
1475,3," ""Compliance rate is the number of an in-store advertiser's signs actually installed instore versus the number contracted for by a 
CPG [i.e., consumer packaged goods manufacturers]."" Pl.'s Mem. 3 [Docket No. 395]."
1475,4," NAM's field force was defined by the number of employees who helped ""install, maintain, and do back end reporting associated 
with [its in-store marketing] programs."" See Pl.'s Mem. 7. "
1477,5," NAM identifies several different types of discovery that it would have sought had Insignia's unfair competition claim been timely 
filed: (1) the potential business relationships that Insignia's claims are relevant to said claim; (2) the ""facts"" supporting Insignia's 
allegation that it had a reasonable expectation that it would contract with these potential business relations; (3) the basis for 
statements made by Mr. Richard Rodriguez, an Insignia employee, in the declaration he submitted in support of Insignia's 
motion; (4) how each of the acts listed by Insignia that it claims are relevant to its proposed claim actually caused CPGs to 
refrain from dealing with Insignia; and (5) what losses Insignia allegedly incurred in connection with its claim. Id. "
1478,1," In both his complaint and his amended complaint Plaintiff also brought suit on behalf of other ""unknown and unnamed"" 
plaintiffs, but the Court has already ordered these unknown plaintiffs stricken from the complaint as legally frivolous [Docket Item 
2]. "
1479,2," Though not specifically plead, Plaintiff is necessarily seeking relief under section four of the Clayton Act, which provides the 
private right of action for all federal antitrust violations. 15 U.S.C. § 15(a); 2660 Woodley Road Joint Venture v. ITT Sheraton 
Corp., 369 F.3d 732, 738 (3d Cir. 2004). Section four reads in relevant part: [A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in  [*3] controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost 
of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
1479,15, U.S.C. § 15(a).
1479,3," Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint incorporates the arguments from Defendants' motion to dismiss 
Plaintiff's initial complaint. (Def. Br. Am. Compl. at 3, n.1) Thus, the Court will refer to both motions throughout this opinion. 
However, because Plaintiff has submitted an amended complaint, Defendants' initial motion to dismiss is deemed moot."
1479,4," Plaintiff bases his allegations on three overdrawn account notices that were postmarked four to six days after the date on the 
notice, and compares them to five account statements that were postmarked either the same day or one to two days later. (Id. at 
45-46.) "
1480,5," Of the banks Plaintiff surveyed, fees ranged between $ 20 to  [*6] $ 38. (Id. at 27-32.) By way of example, Citizens Bank 
charges $ 35 for each item overdrawn for the first three days the account remains overdrawn, and then the fee goes up to $ 38 
per item. (Id. at 27.) Bank of America charges $ 20 for the first day and $ 35 for all subsequent days. (Id. at 28.) Wachovia Bank 
charges $ 22 for the first overdraft and then $ 35 for all subsequent overdrafts. (Id. at 30.) "
1481,6," Sherman Act § 1 declares: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1481,7," Sherman Act § 2 states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
1482,8," Plaintiff's standing, for the purposes of antitrust claims, requires more than that needed for Article III standing. As the Supreme 
Court has explained, ""Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, 
but the court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff  [*13] is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" 
Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 
2d 723 (1983)."
1482,9," The district court held that ""an injury to Dr. Angelico personally does not confer standing upon him without a showing that his 
absence from the relevant product and geographic markets injured competition and/or the consumers of cardiothoracic surgical 
services in these markets."" Angelico, 184 F.3d at 273. "
1483,10," The language of the New Jersey Antitrust Act is virtually identical to the antitrust provisions in the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. §§ 
1, 2; N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 56:9-3, -4. Furthermore, the New Jersey act specifically provides that it ""be construed in harmony with 
ruling judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes and to effectuate, insofar as practicable, a uniformity in the 
laws of those states which enact it."" N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:9-18. As a result, courts look to federal jurisprudence on the Sherman 
Act when analyzing the New Jersey Antitrust Act. Desai v. St. Barnabas Med. Ctr., 103 N.J. 79, 510 A.2d 662, 671 (N.J. 1986); 
Patel, 848 A.2d at 826."
1483,11," The Court notes that overdraft fees, in and of themselves, are not illegal. See Withers v. Jefferson Trust Co., 123 N.J. Eq. 113, 
196 A. 442, 443 (N.J. Ch. 1938) (""[T]he payment of an overdraft by a bank amounts to a loan to its depositor, which is 
recoverable in the absence of an equitable defense.""); see also Center Cadillac, Inc. v. Bank Leumi Trust Co., 859 F. Supp. 97, 
105 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (""Established precedent suggests that defendants had a legal right to treat plaintiffs' overdraft as a loan and 
impose terms and conditions upon its repayment, including charging them a reasonable interest rate.""). "
1484,12," The Court has found insufficient allegations of conspiracy and so it need not address further claims under  [*20] Sherman Act 
§ 1. The Court will, however, very briefly note that Plaintiff's perfunctory suggestion that Defendants are guilty of ""tying"" does not 
state a claim for which relief could be granted, had the Court concluded there were sufficient allegations of concerted action. See 
Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 510 (3d Cir. 1998). Plaintiff bases his tying claim on the offer 
by some unknown bank official that Plaintiff create an overdraft line of credit to avoid future overdraft fees. (Am. Compl. at 41.) 
Because, inter alia, Plaintiff has not alleged that he was forced to set up this credit line in order to open a bank account, he fails 
to state a claim of tying. See Brokerage Concepts, 140 F.3d at 510 (""Tying exists where a seller conditions the sale of one good 
(the tying product) on the buyer also purchasing another, separate good (the tied product)."")"
1484,13," Plaintiff's conclusory statement that Defendants have ""effectively barricaded entry into the market"" is not supported anywhere 
in his amended complaint and does not constitute a ""fact"" in support of his allegations of monopolization. (Am. Compl. at 12.) 
Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1964-65 (""While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed 
factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and 
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  [*24] will not do."") (quoting Papasan, 478 U.S. at 
286). "
1485,14," Any claim of attempted monopolization must similarly fail because, as discussed above, Plaintiff has not sufficiently plead ""that 
[Defendants have] engaged in predatory or anticompetive conduct."" See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 
113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993)."
1485,15," The federal bank fraud statute forbids the following conduct: Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice-- (1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or 
control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; shall be fined not more than $ 1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both."
