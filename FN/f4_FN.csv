22,1," The Court will grant, without any opposition in the record, Vista Healthplans' Motion for Judicial Notice of the Maximus/ACHA 
decisions."
22,2," On June 11, 2003, Maximus rendered its initial decision in a claims dispute between BayCare Health System, Inc. and Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Florida/Health  [*6] Options. Following BayCare's withdrawal of its claims, on August 11, 2003, ACHA 
rendered its final decision dismissing the matter. Exhibit D to Plaintiff's Omnibus Consolidated Opposition to Defendants' 
Motions [DE 67]. The First District Court of Appeal reversed this dismissal in the Health Options opinion cited supra. "
23,3," Plaintiffs also attempt to assert acts of extortion as predicate acts. There are at least two reasons to reject this attempt. First, in 
Scheidler v. NOW, 537 U.S. 393, 123 S. Ct. 1057, 154 L. Ed. 2d 991 (2003), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must allege 
that a RICO defendant acquire  [*9] some property from injured plaintiffs. Though Plaintiffs assert that Defendants have withheld 
money belonging to Plaintiffs, rather than an act of extortion, the parties actually have a dispute over interpretation of ""usual and 
customary"" charges. Second, in this case the medical providers are required to provide services by statute and cannot balance "
24,," bill their HMO patients. Thus, Defendants are not making any threats to Plaintiffs regarding their property, but rather are simply 
(allegedly) not paying enough under the statute."
24,4," The Court may consider documents referred to by a plaintiff in a complaint which are central to the plaintiff's claim for purposes 
of a motion to dismiss without conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Brooks v. Blue Cross & 
Blue Shield of Fla., 116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997) (opinion of then United States District Court Judge Stanley Marcus 
attached to Eleventh Circuit opinion); Smith Barney, Inc. v. Scanlon, 180 F.R.D. 444, 446 (S.D.Fla. 1998). "
25,5," As for the letters Defendants' sent to subscribers informing them that the providers cannot bill the subscribers for the unpaid 
balance (Exhibit 2 to Complaint), these too are accurate statements containing no deception. Furthermore, as the Plaintiffs were 
not the recipients of those letters, Plaintiffs conceded that they cannot use these letters as predicate  [*14] acts which caused 
injury to Plaintiffs. Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1110 (11th Cir. 2001), citing Pelletier v. Zweifel, 921 F.2d 1465, 1499 (11th 
Cir. 1991)."
25,6," Though not necessary at this point (though the issue was fully briefed and argued), the Court does reject Defendants' argument 
that Plaintiffs cannot show any reliance upon Defendants' acts of sending  [*15] the EOB's because the providers are required to 
treat the patients before they are aware of the reimbursement rate. The providers are relying upon receipt from Defendants of 
""the usual and customary charges,"" pursuant to ยง 641.513, in return for their provision of emergency services to HMO 
subscribers. Thus, under the particular statutory duties of provision of care and payment to providers, the Court will infer that the 
reliance element is present in this case. "
26,7," Examples of ""plus"" factors include: ""(1) signaling of intentions; (2) permanent allocations programs; (3) monitoring of sales; (4) 
actions taken contrary to economic self-interest, including (a) little analysis of whether to follow price increases, (b) [competitors] 
pulling away from the discount cigarette market, (c) the May 1995 price increase lead by RJR and followed by Philip Morris, (d) 
Philip Morris' agreement to base the initial [Management Science Associates] ... payments on market capitalization rather than 
market share, and (e) 'excessive' price increases after the MSA; (5) nature of the market; (6) strong motivation; (7) reduction in 
the number of price tiers; (8) opportunities to conspire; (9) pricing decisions made at high levels; (10) the smoking and health 
conspiracy; and (11) foreign conspiracies."" Williamson Oil Co., 346 F.3d at 1305. "
27,8," With regard to Plaintiffs' claims of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit, counsel for Health Options appeared to concede, upon 
questioning by the Court of Plaintiffs' available remedies if no private right of action exists, that such claims could be brought in 
state court. The Court need not decide if such a concession was made, as it will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction."
27,9, The Court notes that Defendant Aetna asserts that this reference is intended to mean ERISA litigation. 
38,1," Section 20-2.1-5(1)(ii) provides that HN1[
] ""duly licensed persons in a fishery as of December 31 of the immediately 
preceding year, shall be eligible to obtain a principal effort license for the fishery sector for which they were licensed on 
December 31 of the immediately preceding year, which principal effort license shall allow its holder to fish in a fishery sector at 
the full harvest and gear levels."""
38,2," Prior to receiving any decision of the Commercial Fishing License Review Board, Riley was notified on April 22, 2003 that said 
Review Board had not yet been fully appointed. Riley asserts that the Board had, in fact, been appointed on April 16, 2003."

public waters, such as the sea, great lakes, etc. Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 14 S. Ct. 548, 38 L. Ed. 331. Such rights are

Law Dictionary 637 (6th ed. 1990)."

mineral and other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect the natural

the natural resources of the state and for the preservation, regeneration and restoration of the natural environment of the 
state."" R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 17."
42,7," This Court agrees that a shortened fishing season would be problematic both for the commercial fishing industry and the 
economy in Rhode Island. Without comprehensive regulation of the fishing industry through licensing, etc. the number of parties 
fishing would likely increase and catch quotas would be met sooner, resulting in a significantly abbreviated fishing season. 
Though Appellant argues the fishing industry could regulate itself, the reality of a ""Tragedy of the Commons"" type instructs us 
otherwise. Too many participants lead to premature depletion of the resource, in this case, fish and shellfish species."

46,15, The Hearing Officer's authority prohibited her from addressing the constitutional issues raised by the Appellant.

98,1," Nonetheless, courts have not foreclosed the possibility that under certain circumstances a well-defined, distinct market could 
consist of just one brand of a product. See U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Industries, Inc., 7 F.3d 986, 998 (11th Cir. 1993)(""A

Bros. Co., Inc., 952 F.2d at 723."
98,2," This is in contrast to the purpose of the NFL trademarks discussed in Weber v. NFL, 112 F. Supp. 2d 667 (N.D.Ohio 2000). In 
Weber, the plaintiff attempted to define a market around Internet domain names employing the trademarked names of NFL 
teams. The exact purpose of a domain name is to identify the origin and represent the content of the Internet site for which it 
serves as an address. Thus, the use of an NFL team name in a domain name does serve as a symbol of the product and the 
content one would find at that address. "
100,3," Though the markets in Board of Regents, 468 U.S. at 85, International Boxing Club, 358 U.S. at 242, and Chicago Professional 
Sports, 961 F.2d at 667, are more properly identified as ""submarkets,"" this distinction is largely irrelevant since submarkets are 
legitimate markets for purposes of antitrust actions. Whether or not a market can be classified as a subset of another larger 
market does not impact the analysis if it is distinct enough to constitute its own legitimate market."
100,4," Though it is not relevant to the inquiry before us and carries no weight at this stage in the litigation, it is worth noting that 
Reebok's 2004 Annual Report, contradicts the complaint's assertion that the company is ""the exclusive provider of apparel and 
headwear bearing the Trademarks of the individual NFL Teams and the NFL."" Reebok's Annual Report states that It has an 
exclusive right to manufacture and distribute NFL-branded replica jerseys, headwear, footwear and gloves and is the exclusive 
distributor of NFL-branded apparel and accessories in some distribution channels. However, it is ""a non-exclusive distributor of 
NFL-branded apparel through catalogs, in retail stores that primarily carry NFL-branded products and in other retail channels."" "
105,*," Circuit Judge Torruella participated in oral argument in this case, but has since recused himself and has not participated in the 
decision of the case. The remaining two panelists, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 46(d), issue this opinion."
105,1," Because we set aside the judgment awarded to Able, we do not address CAPR's second argument on appeal: that the district 
court erred in the calculation of damages. "
106,2," CAPR does point out that Able's chairman admitted at trial that the other two and five pound bag sugar distributors ceased 
operations on January 1, 2002, prior to the alleged predatory pricing period from February of 2002 to September of 2002. The 
district court's finding, however, has no bearing on whether or not there is subject matter jurisdiction; we merely note the 
discrepancy. "
107,3," In a footnote, the district court referenced the transaction between Tropical and CAPR as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction 
and stated ""CAPR did sell refined sugar for exportation."""
107,4," HN3[
] In general, primary line violations involve a claim by the injured party that ""[a] business rival has priced its products in 
an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the "
108,," relevant market."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222; see also III Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 745e, at 477 (2d ed. 
2002). We express no view as to whether the district court correctly determined that the facts alleged by Able establish a primary 
line violation of ยง 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act. This issue has not been raised on appeal. The only question before us is 
whether the ""in commerce"" requirement of the Robinson-Patman Act is satisfied."
108,5," We have excluded language concerning the requirements as to ยง 7 of the Clayton Act, as no ยง 7 allegations are made here."
108,6," To support the finding that Able's transactions could satisfy the ""in commerce"" requirement, the district court erroneously read 
language in Gulf Oil that states, "" ยง 2(a) applies where at least one of the two transactions which, when compared, generate a 
discrimination . . . crosses a state line."" Gulf Oil, 419 U.S. at 200 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Gulf Oil involved "
109,," a secondary line violation which requires, among other things, the discriminating seller to sell to one buyer (the favored buyer) at 
a lower price than to another buyer (the disfavored buyer). The two transactions to be compared, as this court's opinion in 
Coastal Fuels explained, are ""either the sale to the favored buyer or the sale to the buyer allegedly discriminated against."" 
Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 189. In either a primary line violation or a secondary line violation, it is the sales by the defendant 
which are the focus."
109,7," CAPR suggests in its reply brief that the one-time importation of raw sugar cannot satisfy the ""in commerce"" requirement of ยง 
2(a) because CAPR did not regularly import products from across state lines and there was not a ""constant flow"" of raw sugar 
into Puerto Rico. We express no view on the validity of this argument. "
110,8," The district court did not make a specific finding as to whether the refinement process interrupted the flow of commerce. In 
response to CAPR's argument that it did, the district court stated, ""even if the CAPR's refined sugar is not considered to be in the 
flow of commerce, Able Sales' refined sugar, which does not undergo any processing, is undeniably within the flow of 
commerce."""
110,9," We do not understand Able to say it could not buy from CAPR at the same price Tropical did for sugar, whether intended for 
export or not. Nor does Able say that it and Tropical compete with each other to export sugar from Puerto Rico. We understand 
Able's argument to be based on an overall theory of predatory pricing, that CAPR artificially lowered its price in order to drive 
Able, its competitor in the distribution of sugar, out of business. "
111,10," Areeda also warns against reliance on a party's intentions, as opposed to actions, except to cover the situations of ""evasions 
calculated to keep illegal activities entirely intrastate while employing the channels of interstate commerce."" IA Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 267 b, at 324-327 (2d ed. 2000). "
115,1," The Nan Ya Defendants (Nan Ya Taiwan, Nan Ya America and Robert Bradley Dutton) recently settled claims against them 
with all Non-Class Plaintiffs, including Parkdale and Avondale. Although Nan Ya America has not notified the Court that it no 
longer seeks to compel production from Parkdale and / or Avondale, presumably this issue is moot as to these parties."

Second Am. Compl., PP3,80; Parkdale Compl., PP63,64)"
115,6," Plaintiff National Textiles allegedly made indirect purchases of PSF ""in finished yarn products manufactured by certain 
defendants"" and ""purchased  [*12] yarn that incorporated PSF manufactured by one or more defendants."" (Defendants' Exh. E / 
National Textiles' Compl., PP3, 8,29) WestPoint Stevens' Complaint alleges it ""purchased products containing PSF from third

116,7," The Indirect Purchaser Class does not seek monetary damages. (Delta Clothing's Am. Compl., 3:02CV503-V)"
116,8," At least one individual, a former vice president of sales for the now defunct North Carolina-based yarn spinner company Harriet 
& Henderson Yarns, Inc., has agreed to enter a guilty plea in the Eastern District of North Carolina. This individual admitted 
participation in the alleged conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws within the spun yarn industry. (See Press Release, DOJ, (Feb. 
10, 2005))."
116,9, Polyester staple can be either spun by itself into yarn or blended with cotton and spun into yarn.
116,10," In the polyester  [*15] cotton yarn (""PCY"") civil litigation, the Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs define yarn as follows: ""Yarn"" means open-end, air jet cotton and / or poly-cotton yarn, which is textured yarn utilized in connection with the 
manufacture of home furnishings, apparel and industrial fabrics, automotive, upholstery, hosiery, and sewing thread, and is 
produced through the yarn spinning process."" (Defendants' Exhibit C, P5 at 2.)"
116,11," The undersigned did not reach the issue regarding Indirect Purchasers' ability to recover  [*16] monetary damages under 
North Carolina law. (Id. at 6, n.6) "
117,12," The United States opposes Defendants' motion to compel with respect to the documents disclosed in connection with its 
ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the Antitrust Division of the United States Justice Department within the 
Eastern District of North Carolina. According to the Government, compelling production of documents  [*19] as requested within 
Defendants' motion would ""compromise the integrity and secrecy of the grand jury investigation."" (Gvmt.'s Amicus Brief, at 1.)"
117,13," In an attempt to distinguish PCY from any other end-use, Defendants suggest that, for purposes of textile applications, 
polyester cotton yarn is an ""alternative"" for polyester staple. Apparently, some of the larger textile manufacturers are capable of "
118,," purchasing polyester staple and spinning their own yarn while some textile manufacturers out-source all of their yarn-spinning. 
(Defendant's Brief, at 3, 6.) Defendants contend that Springs and others were able to avoid the alleged PSF price increases by 
shifting their purchases to PCY. (Suppl. Mem. at 2.) Even so, the ability to ""shift"" or reduce PSF purchases to another product 
would merely reduce the amount of damages that particular PSF purchaser was entitled to recover as the result of any alleged 
overcharge for actual purchases. (2/15/04 Order, at 5.) The Court does not find this argument persuasive."
118,14," Defendants apparently concede that indirect purchasers are entitled to monetary damages under the laws of certain states. 
Whether indirect purchasers are entitled to monetary damages for antitrust violations in North Carolina, and the extent of 
damages that may be recoverable by indirect purchasers, are issues that have not been fully briefed by the parties. The current 
state of North Carolina law is unclear. Compare Hyde v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 123 N.C.App. 572, 473 S.E.2d 680 (1996); 
N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 75-16; Adams v. Aventis, S.A., 2003 NCBC 7, 2003 WL 22015384 (N.C. Super. 2003); and Crouch v. 
Crompton Corp., 2004 NCBC 7, 2004 WL 2414027, *12 (N.C. Super. 2004)(""There is no definitive decision from the North 
Carolina Supreme Court ruling upon the issue of indirect purchaser standing in North Carolina, nor is there a clear legislative 
history."") In some of the states that are deemed Illinois Brick ""repealer"" states, indirect purchasers are allowed to recover the full extent 
 [*23] of the illegal overcharge just as a direct purchaser would. Report of the Indirect Purchaser Task Force: Section of 
Antitrust Law American Bar Association, 63 ANTITRUST L.J. 993 (Spring 1995). If that were the case in each of the states 
relevant here, the Court's analysis would be the same for both indirect and direct purchasers. In Hyde, however, the North 
Carolina Court of Appeals contemplated that indirect purchaser plaintiffs would be tasked with parcing out the amount of illegal 
overcharge that was passed on to indirect purchasers. Hyde, 123 N.C.App. at 584; Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7, 2004 WL 2414027. "
122,1," The Court notes that the only other remaining Defendants, Linda S. Aldrich and Fox Lea Farm, Inc. did not file dispositive

Shows Association, Inc. (""AHSA"")), Bob Bell, Classic Company Ltd., Kernan Hodges a/k/a Mrs. George H. Hodges, Jr. and 
North Florida Hunter & Jumper Association, Inc. apparently settled with the Plaintiffs and have been dismissed from the case 
(Doc. Nos. 195, 261, 267 and 350). "
123,2," The Court notes that as to Plaintiff Gallagher, the Court granted without prejudice the Burton Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the 
First Amended Complaint since Plaintiff Gallagher did not allege compliance with ""the Federation procedures and did not plead 
he sought a waiver of the Mileage Rule from the Burton Defendants"" (Doc. No. 59)."
123,3," The Mileage Rule provides, in part, that in all States other than Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, 
New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, horse shows offering ""A"" rated hunter and jumper events must be held at least 250 
miles apart on the same date. The Mileage Rule may be waived by a conflicting horse show promoter."
123,4," The Court will not restate the entire factual background of this case. Instead, the Court incorporates by reference the factual 
background as outlined in the Court's Order granting the Burton Defendants, the Federation, the Bell Defendants and Defendant

126,14," The dates that were subject to JES' request were February 5-9, 2003, February 12 - 16, 2003, February 19 - 23, 2004, 
February 26 - March 3, 2003, March 5-9, 2003, March 13 - 16, 2003, March 19 - 23, 2003 and March 25 - 29, 2004 (Doc. No. 
293, Mische Decl., Exh. A). "
128,15, The USOC. 
129,16," In order for an American to play basketball in amateur competition outside of the United States, the player is required to qualify 
as an amateur by receiving a travel permit from the Amateur Basketball Association of the United States (""ABA/USA"") and a 
license from the Federation Internationale de Basketball Amateur (""FIBA"")"
129,17," With respect to Plaintiffs' argument that the Mileage Rule does not minimize scheduling conflicts since it permits a promoter to 
""waive"" a mileage conflict, this Court notes that under the January 2005 rule changes, USEF has ultimate control over all 
waivers (Doc. No. 289, Exh. 1, Long Decl., Exh. C thereto). Furthermore, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that under the January 
2005 rule changes, the only modification is that USEF must give prior approval to ""the incumbent promoters' veto power,"" this 
bolsters the presumption that the Mileage Rule is necessary. Specifically, incumbent promoters may not ""dispense"" with the 
Mileage Rule simply because it suits their purposes. "
130,18, The Burton Defendants join in this argument.
130,19," Plaintiffs' Response to Motions for Summary Judgment incorrectly states that Defendants do not challenge Plaintiff Gallagher's 
standing to sue. "
131,20," At times referred to as ""plus factors."" "
134,21, There is no evidence before this Court as to why the Mileage Rule was originally implemented. 
136,22," David E. Burton, Sr., David E. Burton, Jr., Burtons and Sons, Inc., Littlewood Fences, Inc., Kernan Hodges, USA Equestrian, 
Inc., Bob Bell, Classic Company, Ltd. and North Florida Hunter & Jumper Association, Inc. "
137,23," Plaintiffs concede that their FDUTPA claims ""survive"" or ""fall"" with their antitrust claims. "
140,1," Defendants also move to dismiss under England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 84 S. Ct. 461, 
11 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1964). The Court considered this contention in the April 11, 2005 Order and will not reconsider it here."
140,2," The Court grants Defendants' requests for judicial notice of these and other documents. It is appropriate to refer to documents 
outside the pleadings on this motion to dismiss. To determine claim and issue preclusion, the Court must refer to the previous 
decisions of the state courts. Also, neither party objects to the Court referring to state court documents. "
141,3," Plaintiffs also alleged the same facts in the first amended complaint as part of a substantive due process cause of action. Claim 
preclusion bars relitigation of a substantive due process cause of action based on these facts because, as discussed above, the 
state court rejected due process claims relating to the permit process. "
142,4," To the extent Plaintiffs believe the state courts erroneously relied on failure to exhaust administrative remedies in connection 
with the substantive due process cause of action, that would be the subject of an appeal within the state court system, not 
relitigation by this federal Court. This Court does not review state court decisions. "
144,5," The Court does not rule on Defendants' contention the other taxicab franchisees are indispensable parties to an antitrust claim. 
The parties have not adequately briefed this issue."
144,6," Defendants oppose the counter-motion procedurally, but not on the merits. Defendants have not shown they will be prejudiced 
if the Court considers the motion. The Court will consider the motion."
144,7," For example, Plaintiffs assert their right to damages under ยง 1983 would stem from an equal protection violation. (Pls.' Opp'n at 
3:23-4:9.) The state court did not find an equal protection violation, but found the permit ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. "
145,," Plaintiffs have not shown, and Defendants have not discussed, whether an unconstitutionally vague ordinance entitles Plaintiffs 
to damages under ยง 1983. "
152,1," Although initially Black was named as a codefendant, in 1999 Black was granted summary judgment dismissing the action 
against it and thereafter the action was discontinued against Black."
152,2," The Donnelly Act is ""construed in light of Federal precedent and given a different interpretation only where State policy, 
differences in statutory language or the legislative history justify such a result"" (Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v Abrams, 71 N.Y.2d 327, 
335, 520 N.E.2d 535, 525 N.Y.S.2d 816 [1988]; see X.L.O. Concrete Corp. v Rivergate Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 513, 518, 634 N.E.2d 
158, 611 N.Y.S.2d 786 [1994]). "
155,3," See below, on motion for reargument. "
156,4," Stark contended that ""the issues of damages and liability are completely unrelated. The existence of a price-fixing conspiracy 
has no bearing on the measure of damages purportedly sustained by [Miller] after its termination as a . . . distributor."" According 
to Stark, bifurcation would ""further judicial economy, promote juror understanding of the issues, and require shorter and less 
encompassing closing arguments and jury charges."" Miller did not oppose bifurcation. "
158,5," Assuming that the trier of fact returns a verdict in favor of Miller during the liability portion of the trial, it will then be Miller's 
burden of proof during the damage portion of the trial to show ""the amount of damages"" (see Rossi v Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 
F.3d 452, 484 [3d Cir 1998])."
158,6," Even under the previous order of the court, it was recognized that evidence of the termination was relevant on the issue of 
damages. "
162,7," Stark's current position is ironic, given that it argued on the original motion that the charged conspiracy between it and plaintiff 
could not be shown under Monsanto absent proof that defendant also agreed on similar terms with its other nonterminated 
distributors. That motion proceeded, and was decided, on the assumption that plaintiff had no other proof of the agreement 
between it and Stark. This motion was brought in response to plaintiff's assurances after the court's decision that, indeed, it had 
such other proof. The court also rejects Stark's argument that it had insufficient discovery of such proof. Plaintiff provided interrogatory answers 
identifying the ""other distributors"" as having been involved in the conspiracy and, in any event, it is no secret who Stark's upstate 
distributors were and their respective territories. "
173,1," Although the commission's rule has not yet been codified, we will use its administrative code citation for the sake of clarity and 
convenience. We will refer to the rule as the Wholesale Market Oversight Rule (WMO Rule). "
174,2," Appellants include TXU Generation Company, L.P., TXU Portfolio Management Company, L.P., TXU Electric Delivery 
Company (collectively, TXU); Coalition of Wholesale Electric Market Participants (Coalition); Occidental Chemical Corporation, 
Occidental Permian, Ltd., Occidental Power Marketing, L.P., Occidental Power Services, Inc., Oxy Vinyls, L.P., Ingleside 
Cogeneration, L.P. (collectively, Occidental); Coral Power, L.L.C.; and Texas Genco, L.P. is the intervener."
174,3, ERCOT is also a term used to refer to the transmission system which provides power to roughly 85 percent of the State.
174,4," The BES is a market for same day purchases of power made in fifteen-minute intervals. The ancillary services market is a 
market for same day or day-ahead purchases of capacity. "
177,5," Coalition contends that the final sentence in section 35.004(e) negates the Commission's authority over the ancillary services 
market once customer service is introduced. The final sentence of section 35.004(e) states: On the introduction of customer choice in the ERCOT power region, acquisition of generation-related ancillary services on a 
nondiscriminatory basis by the independent organization in ERCOT on behalf of entities selling electricity at retail shall be 
deemed to meet the requirements of this subsection. Tex. Util. Code Ann. ยง 35.004(e) (West 2004-05) (emphasis added). Reading the statute as a whole, however, it is clear that the 
legislature intended that only acquisitions of ancillary services by the independent organization would be deemed to meet the 
requirements of the section. This is because the independent organization is not affiliated with any market participant and is 
already subject to Commission oversight. See id. ยง 39.151. "
179,6," Texas Genco cites language in PURA section 39.158(b) that the statute is intended to complement other existing state and 
federal antitrust law. It contends that this provision indicates the legislature's intent that the statute be construed using 
""established antitrust principles."" Texas Genco's contention is based on a reading of one sentence in section 39.158(b) in 
isolation. Section 39.158(b) has nothing to do with construing other provisions within the statute; it merely states that the 
remedies in the statute were intended to add to, not replace, existing antitrust provisions."
179,7," Texas Genco acknowledges in its reply brief that increased prices in the Texas wholesale market will be reflected in the retail 
market by distinguishing the Texas industry from California where ""utilities could not increase rates to reflect increases in "
180,," wholesale power costs."" Occidental also distinguishes the California system explaining that California ""created a framework for 
retail competition whereby the regulated retail prices became significantly divorced from wholesale prices. "
181,8," Although the burden of proof is not discussed in section 22.246 of the administrative code, the Commission states in its post-
submission letter brief that ""in all cases the burden is on the Commission staff to demonstrate the elements of a prima facie case 
to the satisfaction of an administrative law judge, if applicable, and ultimately to the Commissioners as decisionmakers."" "
183,9," We decline the Commission's invitation to apply the less stringent standard for vagueness applicable to economic regulation. 
Where, as here, a rule or statute carries ""'potentially significant civil and administrative penalties, including fines and license 
revocation,' quasi-criminal treatment is appropriate and thus the more strict standard of review applies."" Ford Motor Co. v. Texas 
Dep't of Transp., 264 F.3d 493, 508 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Women's Med. Ctr. of N. W. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 422 (5th 
Cir. 2001)). "
184,10," The Commission also points out in its post-submission letter brief that the ERCOT protocols address issues such as 
scheduled maintenance and the shutdown of plants. When an action is authorized by ERCOT under its protocols, it is not a 
prohibited activity. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code ยง 25.503(g) (prohibited activity excludes acts or practices expressly allowed by 
ERCOT protocols or by official interpretations of protocols)."
184,11," TXU complains of the stigmatizing effect of informal commission investigations in which it is compelled to provide information 
demonstrating that certain actions served legitimate business purposes. However, we cannot conclude that an informal 
investigation, even when it is disclosed to the public, amounts to the sort of ""punishment"" which raises vagueness concerns. "
185,12," In Nash, Justice Holmes explained that the constitution's guarantee of fair notice does not equate to perfect notice: The law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates 
it, some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may 
incur the penalty of death. . . . The criterion in such cases is to examine whether common social duty would, under the 
circumstances, have suggested a more circumspect conduct. Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 33 S. Ct. 780, 781-82, 57 L. Ed. 1232 (1913)."
185,13," In construing the DTPA, the supreme court noted the need for section 17.46(a)'s ""catch-all"" provision: A broad interpretation is warranted, however, due to human inventiveness in engaging in deceptive or misleading conduct. 
The legislature did not intend its express purpose of protecting consumers from false trade practices to be circumvented by 
those who would seek out loopholes in the Act's provisions. Pennington v. Singleton, 606 S.W.2d 682, 688, 23 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 587 (Tex. 1980). "
186,14," We also reject the dissent's argument that vagueness in the WMO Rule would ""chill competition in a manner inconsistent with 
the legislature's intent."" As we have discussed above, the affirmative defense included in the WMO Rule alleviates much of the 
complained of uncertainty by giving a market participant guidance that, if it is diligent as to the effects of its actions on the 
market, the market participant will not be subject to liability under the rule. Nor do we conclude that any remaining uncertainty in 
the WMO Rule would result in some sort of de facto regulation. "
187,15," Occidental contends that the prohibition on creating ""artificial congestion"" is unconstitutionally vague because ""a market 
participant cannot create artificial congestion without knowing how others operate their units . . . and that market participants do 
not always have sufficient knowledge to anticipate the effects the their actions may produce."" If, in fact, the market participant 
lacked access to information which would reveal the possibility of creating congestion, section 25.503(h) would exempt the 
conduct from prosecution as a prohibited activity. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code ยง 25.503(h). "
188,16," Counsel for TXU acknowledged at oral argument that a facial challenge would be inappropriate if the rule does not require a 
market participants to price power at marginal cost. "
191,17," ""On or before June 30, 2001, the commission shall modify its current rules regarding customer protections to ensure that at 
least the same level of customer protection against potential abuses and the same quality of service that exists on December 31, 
1999, is maintained in a restructured electric industry."" Sec. 39.101(f)."
191,1," I thus disagree with the majority's dismissal of state and federal antitrust authorities as merely ""persuasive."" Slip op. at 14 & 
n.6. "
192,2," The WMO Rule does not define ""market power abuse"" other than to explain that the term includes ""withholding of production, 
whether economic withholding or physical withholding, by a market participant who has market power, constitutes an abuse of 
market power."" See 16 Tex. Admin. Code Ann. ยง 25.503(g)(7). Given the nature of the wholesale electricity market, it is unclear 
whether or how market participants could ascertain whether they possess ""market power"" at a given moment amid the myriad, 
fluid circumstances on the grid, much less conform their conduct to avoid the prohibited effects. Nor is it clear whether or how 
market participants could ascertain how to avoid committing such other violations as creating ""artificial congestion."" See id. ยง 
25.503(g)(1)."
192,3," In response to my discussion of Caller-Times and federal antitrust cases, the majority inaccurately portrays my arguments and 
attempts to pigeonhole them as relating to constitutional vagueness issues rather than statutory construction. Slip op. at 29-30. 
As is apparent above, my arguments concern the proper construction of section 39.157, and respecting the legislature's 
balancing of interests reflected therein. Having determined that rule 25.93 exceeds the Commission's statutory power, I would 
not reach the constitutional issues. "
193,4," In such an environment, it is perhaps not surprising that several of the market participants equate rule 25.503 with back-door 
price regulation. They contend that uncertainty regarding the nature of competitive conduct that is proscribed, the prospect of 
sanctions based not on intent but mere effect, and a ""guilty until proven innocent"" burden of proof has compelled them to cling to 
any guidance they could discern from the rule, such as the Commission's reference to marginal cost pricing in the preamble to 
the rule. See 29 Tex. Reg. 1899, 1916 (2004) (to be codified at 16 Tex. Admin. Code ยง 25.503 (Pub. Util. Comm'n)) (""Pricing in 
excess of marginal cost by a seller who is immune from the chastening hand of competition is an abuse of market power.""). "
194,5," The legislature enacted section 35.004(e) as part of the 1999 electricity deregulation bill. See Act of May 27, 1999, 76th Leg., 
R.S., ch. 405, ยงยง 17, 39, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 2543, 2552, 2558-2602. "
198,1," The amended motion (Dkt. # 124) was submitted before plaintiffs' response was filed, but only officially filed thereafter. The 
amended motion is not substantively changed from the original, only correcting citation problems. The response was filed with 
reference to the original motion; the reply was originally filed with reference to the amended motion. The sur-reply was filed with 
reference to both. The Court will therefore address both. "
200,2," HN1[
] To bring an antitrust claim for injunctive relief, private plaintiffs must show, above and beyond the constitutional case 
or controversy requirements, ""(1) that the acts violating the antitrust laws โฆ threatened to cause [those plaintiffs] injury in fact to 
[their] business or property; (2) that this injury is not too remote or duplicative of the recovery of a more directly injured person; 
[and] (3) that such injury is antitrust injury,' which is defined as the kind of injury that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent 
and flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.'"" 2 Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law P335a (2d ed. 2000) 
(quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)); see also Full Draw 
Prods. v. Easton Sports, Inc., 182 F.3d 745, 750 (10th Cir. 1999); Sports Racing Servs., Inc. v. Sports Car Club of Am., Inc., 131 
F.3d 874 (10th Cir. 1997); City of Chanute, Kan. v. Williams Natural Gas Co., 955 F.2d 641, 652 (10th Cir. 1992). Plaintiffs' 
complaint sufficiently alleged both antitrust injury and causal connection to withstand a motion to dismiss. However, at this stage, 
the Court must address the merits of plaintiffs' allegations of antitrust injury before proceeding with standing analysis. "
201,3," Plaintiffs cite United States v. Socony Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 221-223, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940), for the 
proposition that the Sherman Act condemns any agreement or state legislation that raises, depresses, fixes, pegs, or stabilizes 
the price of a commodity. Plaintiff's Response (Dkt. # 114), at 14 (emphasis added). However, Socony Vacuum was the criminal 
prosecution of an oil company and others under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and dealt only with private action. Similarly, the 
other cases cited in plaintiffs' response and surreply briefs to support the argument that raising rivals' costs is a per se violation 
involve only private action. See United States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645 (7th Cir. 2000); Gen. Leaseways. Inc. v. Nat'l Truck 
Leasing Assn, 744 F.2d 588 (7th Cir. 1984); Nat'l Soc'y. of Prof'I Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 
2d 637 (1978)."
201,4," Defendant also argues that (1) there is no basis for evaluating the MSA or Allocable Share Amendment under the rule of 
reason; and (2) even if the analysis laid out in California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum. Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 
100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980), were applied, state supervision of the only conduct required or authorized by the statute 
-- payment of statutorily specified amounts into escrow--would prevent any challenge to the Allocable Share Amendment. "
202,," If there has been no delegation of regulatory authority to private parties, the state action is ""ipso facto"" immune from antitrust 
challenge and so, not subject to preemption. Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 567-68, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984). 
Further, where a state does not authorize or require a party to engage in private or hybrid conduct that would violate antitrust 
laws, Midcal analysis is not required. Massachusetts Food Ass'n v. Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 197 
F.3d 560 (1st Cir. 1999). Accordingly, because the Court has found no hybrid restraint, nor any other manner in which the 
Allocable Share Amendment serves to enforce an private decision to restrain competition, it does not reach either of these 
arguments."
202,5," Although plaintiffs, in their surreply, assert that the Court has found the Allocable Share Amendment serves to enforce the 
MSA, obviating the need for private parties to act to create an anticompetitive scheme, plaintiffs have overstated the Court's 
order addressing defendant's motion to dismiss. By its nature, an order addressing a motion to dismiss makes no finding as to 
the merits of a case. The sole purpose of such an order is to determine whether the allegations of a plaintiff's complaint 
sufficiently support a claim for relief. The Court found that the allegations supported an antitrust claim, not that the allegations 
had been proved."
202,6," Although plaintiffs point to the Allocable Share Amendment's imposition of higher costs upon NPMs, and their resultant 
increase in prices, the fact that the higher costs may affect NPM decisions about where to distribute their cigarettes or lessen 
their competitive advantage as against PMs has no bearing on antitrust analysis as long as there is no private or hybrid restraint. 
So, although these facts may be disputed, they do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to plaintiffs' antitrust claim. "
203,7," Although plaintiffs have pointed to the Bedell court's recognition of OPM lock-step price increases following the initial 
enactment of the MSA implementing legislation and to the OPMs' similar substantial price increases in January 2005, they have 
offered no evidence, other than temporal proximity, supporting a causal connection between these later price increases and the 
Allocable Share Amendment. This, in light of the expert testimony that PMs make their output and pricing decisions unilaterally, 
is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact."
203,8," Because the Court has found no Sherman Act violation, and so no antitrust injury, it grants summary judgment based on state 
action immunity and does not reach the remainder of the standing analysis discussed in note 2 supra. In the briefing related to the motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs also claim to seek an injunction against enforcement of 
any associated tax regulations intended to be applied in connection with the Allocable Share provision. Because the Court has 
dismissed constitutional challenges to the amended escrow statute, and granted summary judgment as to the antitrust claim, the 
issue of the tax regulations is moot. "
213,1," Although there are two separate MSAAs in the record, each covering different labor organizations, they have identical terms. 
(Pls.' Exs. 16 & 17). We thus refer to them as a single agreement."
213,2," The revenue-sharing formula is set forth at paragraph 6 of the MSAA, and is reproduced verbatim as Appendix A to this 
Memorandum and Order."
213,3," The Supermarkets and the unions entered into an agreement to end the strike on February 26, 2004. The unions' members 
ratified the agreement on February 29, 2004. (Cox Decl. P 7; Schroeder Decl. P 15). "
214,4," Throughout this opinion we refer to Brown v. Pro Football, Inc. simply as ""Brown."" There is, however, another similarly named, 
relevant Supreme Court opinion. See NLRB v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839, 85 S. Ct. 980 (1965). To distinguish the 
two, we refer to the latter by its full name (""NLRB v. Brown""). "
215,5," Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Brown, the Ninth Circuit used a three-factor test to determine whether this exemption 
applied. Phoenix Elec. Co. v. Nat'l Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 81 F.3d 858, 861 (9th Cir. 1996) (applying the exemption when ""(1) 
the restraint primarily affects the parties to the agreement and no one else, (2) the agreement concerns wages, hours, or 
conditions of employment that are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, and (3) the agreement is produced from bona 
fide, arm's-length collective bargaining."") (citing test from Mackey v. Nat'l Football League, 543 F.2d 606, 614 (8th Cir. 1976)). 
To the extent that this so-called ""Mackey test"" exempts only agreements between unions and employers, it does not survive 
Brown, which extended the exemption to an employer-only agreement. See Clarett v. Nat'l Football League, 369 F.3d 124, 134 
(2d Cir. 2004) (""the suggestion that the Mackey factors provide the proper guideposts . . . simply does not comport with the 
Supreme Court's most recent treatment of the non-statutory labor exemption in Brown. . . .""). Moreover, while the Mackey test 
required all three factors to be present, Brown does not adopt such a rigid test. But even if Phoenix Elec. Co. were still good law, 
the challenged provisions would clearly not be exempt from antitrust scrutiny because they do not concern wages, hours or 
conditions of employment as required by the second factor of the Mackey test. "
217,6," By this we do not mean to suggest that national labor policy supports use of a revenue-sharing agreement during a strike. See 
discussion infra Part IV.B.2. We simply point out that HN9[
] once the strike is over and a new CBA is agreed upon, there is not 
even an arguable case for reliance on the collective bargaining process to justify an exemption from the antitrust laws."
217,7," We use the phrase ""relative market shares"" in a very specific sense. Defendants shared revenue based on each chain's 
individual share of the aggregated, pre-strike sales. While this did not necessarily constitute apportionment of the entire market 
for groceries in Southern California, by its own terms it sought to maintain each competitor's portion of their aggregated share of 
that total market. "
218,8," Before Brown, courts generally limited the application of the exemption to agreements whose anticompetitive restraints fell 
primarily and directly on the labor market. See Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 311 U.S. App. D.C. 89, 50 F.3d 1041, 1051 (D.C. 
Cir. 1995), aff'd 518 U.S. 231, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521, 116 S. Ct. 2116 (1996) (""[T]he case for applying the exemption is strongest 
where a restraint on competition operates primarily in the labor market and has no anti-competitive effect on the product 
market.""); Mid-Am. Reg'l Bargaining Ass'n v. Will County Carpenters District Council, 675 F.2d 881, 893 (7th Cir. 1982) (""Thus, a 
complaint must allege conduct operating as a direct restraint upon the business market in order to avoid application of the 
nonstatutory exemption.""); Consol. Express, Inc. v. N.Y. Shipping Ass'n, 602 F.2d 494, 513 (3rd Cir. 1979), vacated on other 
grounds, 448 U.S. 902, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1131, 100 S. Ct. 3040 (1980) (""The term nonstatutory exemption . . . is a shorthand 
description of an interpretation of the Sherman Act, making that statute inapplicable to restraints imposed in the interest of lawful 
union monopoly power in the labor market.""). Brown did not negate or implicitly overrule this nexus between exempted conduct 
and the labor market. See Connell, 421 U.S. at 622 (""[T]he nonstatutory exemption offers no . . . protection when a union and a 
nonlabor party agree to restrain competition in a business market."")."
218,9," Defendants cite two out-of-circuit cases for the proposition that employer revenue-sharing agreements like this one are 
protected by the nonstatutory labor exemption. In the first, the Second Circuit upheld a joint strike insurance plan against an 
antitrust challenge. Kennedy v. Long Island R.R., 319 F.2d 366, 374 (2d Cir. 1963). However, the applicability of the 
nonstatutory labor exemption was not before, and was not considered by, the court. The court focused instead upon whether the 
insurance policy was a substantive violation of the antitrust laws. Of course, whether the challenged MSAA provisions violate the 
antitrust laws is not before us on this motion. Thus, Kennedy offers us no guidance here. Defendants also rely upon a case in which several airlines joined together in a mutual aid pact. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l v. Civ. 
Aeronautics Bd., 163 U.S. App. D.C. 451, 502 F.2d 453 (D.C. Cir. 1974). This case does not assist our inquiry because the court 
declined to address the antitrust issue due to the plaintiff's failure to exhaust an administrative remedy. Id. at 457. Further, Air 
Line Pilots involved an explicit statutory exemption in the Federal Aviation Act, not the implicit nonstatutory exemption now 
before us. Id. at 457 & n.14 (citing 49 U.S.C. ยง 1384 (1974), which relieved the potential defendant ""from the operation of the 
antitrust laws'"" (repealed by the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984, PL 98-443)). "
221,10," The record contains two separate collective bargaining agreements between Food 4 Less and UFCW locals. (See Pl.'s. Exs. 
2-3). Both agreements ran from February 27, 2000 through February 28, 2004. (Id.). As the differences between these two 
agreements are not salient to the present dispute, we refer to them as a single agreement."
221,11," Food 4 Less never received the benefit of this reciprocal revenue-sharing provision, however, as it was able to avert a strike 
when negotiating its own CBA. (Supp. Schroeder Decl. PP 2-5)."
221,12," The State proffered the Food 4 Less CBA that was executed by an entity referred to as Food 4 Less of California, Inc. which 
appears to be a corporate entity distinct from Ralphs. (Pl.'s Exs. 2-3). In fact, Food 4 Less is sometimes treated as a separate 
entity in The Kroger Company's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the corporate hierarchy. 
(See Pl.'s Exs. 1, 49-51). Defendants submitted evidence demonstrating that Food 4 Less is merely a dba of Ralphs, and ""Food 
4 Less of California"" is a dormant subsidiary whose name was used in error on Food 4 Less's CBA. Defendants also 
demonstrated that Food 4 Less's administrative structure is closely tied to Ralphs's own operations, and that Food 4 Less had 
an interest in the Ralphs/Vons/Albertson's CBA because Food 4 Less's own contract would be affected by it. (Schroeder Decl. 
PP 3-5, 7, 14; Defs.' Exs. I & J)."
221,13, See discussion supra n.9. 
222,14," Defendants also cite a district court case from the Southern District of New York for the proposition that inclusion of Food 4 
Less in the MSAA does not preclude application of the exemption. See Sage Realty Corp. v. ISS Cleaning Servs. Group, Inc., 
936 F. Supp. 130, 137-39 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). The primary holding of the case was that the plaintiff suffered no antitrust injury. Id. 
at 136-37. The district court's analysis of the applicability of the exemption sheds no light on the relevant considerations set forth 
in Brown. See id. at 137-38. Significantly, it offers no guidance whatsoever on the implications of involvement of a competitor, 
like Food 4 Less, who is not a member of the multiemployer bargaining unit. See id. at 138 n.7 (noting that the defendants' 
actions had no anticompetitive effect on the market). We do not find Sage Realty's analysis of the exemption persuasive in a 
situation, like ours, in which the conduct at issue involved an employer who is purportedly a horizontal competitor of the 
members of the multiemployer bargaining unit. "
223,15," Defendants also imply that because lockouts, which are afforded the nonstatutory immunity, are ""responses"" to strikes, 
revenue sharing, which is a ""response"" to selective picketing, should be similarly immune. The syllogism is false. 
""Responsiveness"" is not the touchstone of the nonstatutory immunity. As we addressed above, see supra discussion Part 
IV.B.2, lockouts warrant immunity because their primary and direct restraint falls on the labor market. The same cannot be said 
of the revenue sharing scheme in the MSAA. "
229,1," Plaintiffs allege that Equilon and Equiva Services are related to and controlled by Shell Oil Company, and that all defendants 
are jointly and severally liable for the acts complained of in this lawsuit. Defendants do not contest this characterization in their 
motion to dismiss. "
231,2," Count 3 is based on allegations that each plaintiff was eligible for an ""Interim Rent Challenge"" (a Shell program allowing for a 
reduction in lease rates for franchisees who complained of high rents), that Shell intentionally withheld information from plaintiffs 
about the Interim Rent Challenge, and affirmatively misrepresented to plaintiffs that Shell had no procedure available to 
franchisees to challenge allegedly excessive rental rates. (Complaint PP 76-85.) In addition to its Rule 9 argument, Shell claims 
(without citation to authority) that there can be no claim for damages based on these facts, essentially because such damages 
would be speculative. This argument fails. While plaintiffs may face a difficult challenge in proving the extent of damages, their 
allegations are sufficient to state a claim. See, e.g., McHugh v. Westpac Banking Corp., Nos. 93C3058, 93C3059, 1995 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 11397, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 8, 1995) (noting that allegations of lost business opportunities are sufficient to support a

248,30," The court instructed the jury regarding anticompetitive conduct as follows: Anti-competitive conduct is conduct that has the effect of wrongly preventing or excluding competition, or frustrating or 
impairing the efforts of other firms to compete for customers within the relevant market, making it very difficult or impossible 
for competitors to engage in fair competition. Not everything that enables a company to gain or maintain a monopoly is anti-
competitive. In deciding whether conduct is anti-competitive, you should consider whether the conduct lacks a valid business purpose, 
or unreasonably or unnecessarily impedes the efforts of other firms to compete for raw materials or customers, or if the 
anticipated benefits of the conduct flow primarily from its tendency to hinder or eliminate competition. Anti-competitive 
conduct does not include ordinary means of competition, such as offering better products or services, exercising superior 
skill or business judgment, utilizing more efficient technology, better marketing, or exercising natural competitive 
advantages such as unique geographic access to raw materials or markets. . . . . One of Plaintiffs' contentions in this case is that the Defendant purchased more logs than it needed or paid a higher price 
for logs than necessary, in order to prevent the Plaintiffs from obtaining the logs they needed at a fair price. If you find this

Sundar V. Nilavar (Doc. #124), but subsequently withdrew said motion. See Agreed Order Relating to Discovery Motions (Doc.

275,5," With respect to the purported case law rejecting Dr. Pisarkiewicz's definition of the product market, Defendants cite cases that 
are of the same ilk as Jefferson Parish and Reddy. Similarly to Defendants' reliance on Jefferson Parish and Reddy, the cases 
simply do not stand for the proposition that the relevant product market in this case has been defined as a matter of law, and, 
even if it had, such an argument would not, per se, be a reason to exclude Dr. Pisarkiewicz's testimony. "
277,6," These hospitals include Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, James Cancer Hospital 
and Solove Research Institute, Children's Hospital Columbus, and The Children's Medical Center of Dayton, Dearborn County, 
Gateway Rehab, Hillside Rehabilitation, Margaret Mary, Reid, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, St. Elizabeth, St. Lukes 
East and West, Todd Children's Hospital, ""and other out of state hospitals"" (Doc. #125 Ex. Q, Table 1). "
278,7," With respect to the notion of ""sufficient quantity,"" in his original Report, Dr. Pisarkiewicz explained that there are types of 
""specialized medical services ... for which patients are likely to search more widely and place greater trust in a hospital [that] 
performs these specialized procedures more frequently than [Mercy Medical Center, Mercy Memorial Hospital or Community 
Hospital]"" (Pisarkiewicz Report at ยถ 34). Accordingly, to say that a service is not available in sufficient quantity is actually another 
way of saying that it is perceived to be not available in sufficient quality. "
279,8," Defendants suggest that some of the hospitals in Dr. Pisarkiewicz's list are not actually specialty facilities. For example, they 
suggest that the Cleveland Clinic ""is not a specialty hospital at all but rather a tertiary acute care hospital"" (Doc. #141 at 10). "
281,9," Locum tenens physicians are essentially temporary physicians who, according to Dr. Pisarkiewicz, are ""paid little and are 
unfamiliar with the staff, the equipment and the hospital procedures"" and are paid less than regular physicians (Pisarkiewicz 
Report at ยถ 52). "
296,1," Plaintiff has not offered market share information. Defendants have submitted figures showing the number of shoppers inserted 
in El Nuevo Dia. These figures do not include shoppers distributed in other newspapers or by other means and, therefore, do not 
constitute complete market shares. "
298,2," Defendants contend that count 2 was necessarily dismissed as a result of our ruling on February 6, 2004, because our ruling 
dismissed all conspiracy claims and count 2 alleges concerted action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiff contends that 
count 2 is a claim for an unlawful tying arrangement under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and, therefore, the reasoning behind 
the dismissal of Plaintiff's other conspiracy counts does not apply. Because our discussion herein of Plaintiff's tying claims under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act applies equally to a tying claim asserted under Section 1, we will treat count 2 as a surviving claim. "
299,3," HN12[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act forbids any monopoly, or attempt to monopolize, or combination or conspiracy to monopolize. 15 U.S.C. ยง 2. "
303,4," Plaintiff contends that Defendants have engaged in unlawful tying in violation of Section 1, and then argues that those tying 
arrangements support its attempted monopolization claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Docket Document No. 176. The 
existence of two separate products and the presence of coercion are essential elements of an unlawful tying arrangement under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act. If Plaintiff's tying claims fail under Section 1, then they cannot provide evidence for its attempted 
monopolization claims under Section 2. "
304,5," Corporate supplements, thus, resemble other advertising vehicles as to which courts have rejected tying claims that attempted 
to split integral components of those vehicles into tied and tying products. Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 674 F.2d 1343, 1347 
(9th Cir. 1982) (advertising in legal directory and requirement to purchase copy of directory single product); RFD Publ'ns, Inc. v.

on by Plaintiff, is inapposite. The single-product plaintiff in 3M was unable to compete with the defendant's multi-product 
discounts: The plaintiff's ""healthy operating income"" fell and became ""large operating losses,"" its sales and its market share 
declined, and it closed one of its two plants. 324 F.3d at 161-62. Here, Plaintiff has been profitable, its shopper sales have 
increased, its market share has remained constant, and it has added new production capacity. Moreover, in 3M, the defendant 
was an admitted monopolist that used its multi-product discounts to prevent the plaintiff from successfully entering the market. 
Id. at 159-60. Here, Defendant AGP was a new entrant and Plaintiff was the dominant incumbent, whose market share prior to 
AGP's entry was in excess of 80 percent. "
307,7," Plaintiff also argues that Defendant AGP charged prices below average variable cost to certain customers when it first entered 
the market in 1997, and shortly thereafter. Docket Document No. 176. HN38[
] Promotional discounts by new entrants, 
however, are not regarded as predatory. HN39[
] ""Unless continued over a long period of time, in which case it is no longer 
promotional, promotional pricing by new entrants . . . [is] no threat to competition. . . . Under these circumstances courts find 
promotional prices lawful, no matter what that price-cost relationship."" III Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 
492 (2002) (footnote omitted). See also Am. Academic Suppliers, Inc. v. Beckley-Cardy, Inc., 922 F.2d 1317, 1322 (7th Cir. 
1991) (""It is commonplace for new entrants to use deep discounts to persuade customers to switch from established firms. 
These promotional discounts raise no antitrust problems. . . ., though often they are below incremental cost in a superficial 
sense.""). Moreover, Defendant AGP's general manager in 1997-1998, in testimony offered by Plaintiff, said that the company 
never priced below cost."
307,8," In its complaint, Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant El Dia engaged in below-cost pricing of insertion services in the 
newspaper. Docket Document No. 1. Plaintiff subsequently contended that Defendant El Dia's above-normal profits on insertion 
proved that it possessed market power. Docket Document No. 176. Those two positions are inconsistent. Defendants' 
accounting expert concluded that Defendants priced above average variable costs for insertion services, and there is no genuine 
dispute that Defendants' insertion pricing was not below any relevant measure of cost. "
318,1," The rule provides: HN1[
] The Chief Master or Vice-Chief Master of the Professional Responsibility Tribunal shall notify the respondent and 
the General Counsel of the appointment and membership of the Trial Panel and of the time and place for hearing, which 
shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of appointment of the Trial Panel. Extensions of 
this period may be granted by the Chief Master (or the Vice-Chief Master, in case of the unavailability of the Chief Master) 
for good cause shown. "
319,2," HN2[
]  Rule 33(d) provides that a member in good standing of the bar of another State may be admitted to appear pro hac 
vice in Arizona upon approval by the court hearing the matter. HN3[
] Rule 34 lists the requirements for admission to the State 
Bar of Arizona, which include passing the bar examination and being certified by the Committee on Character and Fitness as 
possessing good moral character. "
320,3," The district court's dismissal of the Oklahoma defendants was premised upon the absence of personal jurisdiction, not subject 
matter jurisdiction. HN7[
] Where ""subject-matter jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry,"" however, ""both expedition and 
sensitivity to state courts' coequal stature should impel the federal court to dispose of that issue first."" Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon 
Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 587-88, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760, 119 S. Ct. 1563 (1999). Here, the subject matter jurisdiction inquiry involves a 
straightforward application of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, and we accordingly adhere to the Supreme Court's admonition by 
relying upon the lack of subject matter jurisdiction to dismiss the Oklahoma defendants. "
336,1," General Statutes ยง 35-31 (b) provides: HN1[
] ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person 
when said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States."""
336,2," Saunders is a founding member of Miller's Pond Company, LLC, and Schacht is a managing member of that company."
336,3," The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and upon the unopposed motion of the 
defendants, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes ยง 51-199 (c) and Practice Book ยง 65-2."
336,4," General Statutes ยง 35-44b provides: HN2[
] ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-"
336,46," , inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."""
336,5," For purposes of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants admitted all of the factual allegations in the plaintiffs' 
complaint. The trial court, therefore, treated the defendants' motion for summary judgment as the equivalent of a common-law 
motion for judgment on the pleadings. See, e.g., Sewer Commission v. Norton, 164 Conn. 2, 5, 316 A.2d 775 (1972) (stating that 
HN3[
] motion for judgment on pleadings ""requires a situation where the parties are willing to admit the facts and place their 
entire case on the legal issues raised, waiving the right to replead if the legal issue is decided against them"" [internal quotation 
marks omitted]). Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, we accept as undisputed the facts pleaded in the complaint, and 
unless otherwise noted, quotations from the record originate from that pleading. "
337,6," The 1988 agreement also provides that, in the event that the city determines that a water shortage exists, Waterford ""shall"" 
make available ""a suitable additional source of water supply,"" if possible. If there is no additional source available, the city may 
refuse to accept new applications for water service in both the city and Waterford until the supply reserves are replenished."
337,7," The plaintiffs note that during the negotiation of the 1990 agreement, Waterford refused to allow the Faria Corporation, a major 
industry in Montville, to have access to water for fire protection purposes. "
338,8," The New London water authority reiterated its refusal to deal with the plaintiffs at a meeting in May, 2000. The chairman of the 
water authority told the plaintiffs that ""'we're the only game in [Waterford]. Forget going into the water business and forget the 
Connecticut Water Company.'"""
338,9," These other sources are located outside the city and Waterford, and are not subject to the 1988 agreement and its deterrence 
clause. "
339,10," General Statutes ยง 35-26 provides: HN4[
] ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or 
commerce is unlawful."""
339,11," General Statutes ยง 35-27 provides: HN5[
] ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."""
339,12," General Statutes ยง 35-28 provides: HN6[
] ""Without limiting section 35-26, every contract, combination, or conspiracy is unlawful when the same are for the purpose, or have the effect, of: (a) Fixing, controlling, or maintaining prices, rates,

manufacture, mining, sale, or supply of any part of trade or commerce; (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets, either 
functional or geographical, in any part of trade or commerce; or (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing third 
parties to refuse to deal with another person."""
339,13," General Statutes ยง 35-29 provides: HN7[
] ""Every lease, sale or contract for the furnishing of services or for the sale of 
commodities, or for the fixing of prices charged therefor, or for the giving or selling of a discount or rebate therefrom, on the 
condition or understanding that the lessee or purchaser shall not deal in the services or the commodities of a competitor or 
competitors of the lessor or seller, shall be unlawful where the effect of such lease or sale or contract for sale or such condition 
or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any part of trade or commerce and 
where such goods or services are for the use, consumption or resale in this state."" HN8[
] Under ยง 35-29, a ""tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchase a different (tied) product, or at least agree that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier."" 
State v. Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., 181 Conn. 655, 659, 436 A.2d 284 (1980). "
340,14," The trial court also relied on a pair of state and federal trial court decisions applying ยง 35-31 (b), both of which were authored 
by Judge Covello. See generally Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, Inc. v. Galante, 136 F. Supp. 2d 21, 2000 WL 863029 
(D. Conn. 2001); Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Blackstone, 35 Conn. Sup. 136, 400 A.2d 1031 (1978)."
340,15," General Statutes ยง 25-33c provides: HN9[
] ""The General Assembly finds that an adequate supply of potable water for 
domestic, commercial and industrial use is vital to the health and well-being of the people of the state. Readily available water 
for use in public water systems is limited and should be developed with a minimum of loss and waste. In order to maximize 
efficient and effective development of the state's public water supply systems and to promote public health, safety and welfare, 
the Department of Public Health shall administer a procedure to coordinate the planning of public water supply systems."" "
341,16," The trial court, in discussing Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. 341, stated that it ""is interesting to note that this doctrine has 
evolved through the years; under federal antitrust laws, the defendants' activities would clearly be exempt from liability."" 
Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to consider the defendants' proposed alternate ground for affirmance. See, e.g., New Haven 
v. Bonner, 272 Conn. 489, 497, 863 A.2d 680 (2005) HN11[
] (declining to consider alternate ground for affirmance that was 
not raised before trial court)."
341,17," The Sherman Act provides in relevant part: HN14[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."" 15 
U.S.C. ยง 1. "
342,18," Indeed, we note that the defendants cite multiple cases wherein municipal water and sewer companies have been held 
immune from federal antitrust liability under the Parker doctrine. See, e.g., Hallie v. Eau Claire, supra, 471 U.S. 42 (Stating that 
""it is sufficient that the statutes authorized the city to provide sewage services and also to determine the areas to be served. We 
think it is clear that anticompetitive effects logically would result from this broad authority to regulate.""); McCallum v. Athens, 976 
F.2d 649, 655 (11th Cir. 1992) (concluding that municipal waterworks is immune from antitrust liability in action brought by retail 
customers because statutes ""unequivocally revealed that [state legislature] contemplated that its municipalities might engage in 
anticompetitive conduct""); Kern-Tulare Water District v. Bakersfield, 828 F.2d 514, 519-20 (9th Cir. 1987) (concluding that city's 
refusal to consent to water district's transfer of surplus water to other utilities was ""foreseeable within the [statutory] authority of 
the city to contract for, acquire and hold water rights, to furnish itself and its inhabitants with water, and to sell, lease, exchange, 
or transfer surplus water""), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1015, 108 S. Ct. 1752, 100 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1988). "
344,19," General Statutes ยง 35-35 provides: HN21[
] ""The state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a consumer, injured in its 
business or property by any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable 
attorney's fee and costs."""
344,20," The relevant provision of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15, provides in relevant part: HN22[
] ""(a) Amount of recovery; 
prejudgment interest ""Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the 
defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. . . ."""
344,21," In so concluding, we also noted the extensive legislative history behind the failure of numerous ""Illinois Brick repealer bills,"" 
which attempted to nullify at the state level the United States Supreme Court holding in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, 431 
U.S. 735; Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., supra, 260 Conn. 77-82, 77 n.22; as well as the ""the inferential value of failed attempts to 
amend existing laws with respect to the intent of the legislature to acquiesce in prevailing judicial interpretations of such laws."" 
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 79."
344,22," Discussed at oral argument before this court, another example of a federal-state antitrust distinction is Congress' express 
prohibition on the recovery of damages from a municipality under the Clayton Act, an enactment that has no parallel in the state 
statutory scheme. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 35 (a) (""no damages, interest on damages, costs, or attorney's fees may be recovered under "
345,," section 4, 4A, or 4C of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C. ยงยง 15, 15a, or 15c] from any local government, or official or employee thereof 
acting in an official capacity"")."
345,23," We note that the legislative history of ยง 35-44b indicates that the legislature's purpose in enacting that statute was to ""mirror 
what Connecticut has done with unfair trade practices. Under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act . . . Connecticut looks 
to Federal Unfair Trade Practices Act, jurisprudence. [Section 35-44b] would attempt to do the same thing with antitrust law. 
The goal being to have a single antitrust jurisprudence in the United States. This is vital if corporations are going to be able to 
make critical decisions about research and development projects, that they may undertake. ""[This is like] corporate ventures in general, where antitrust laws may pose an obstacle. This would allow them to look to a single 
case law jurisprudence, in order to know whether they're in compliance with our laws or not. Currently, a corporation in 
Connecticut or elsewhere, may have to look to [fifty] different sets of jurisprudence. This would move towards a national 
jurisprudence, and I believe it will strongly enhance the international competitiveness of Connecticut, and of American 
manufacturing and research companies, wherever they may be."" 35 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1992 Sess., pp. 2386-87, remarks of 
Representative Thomas Moukawsher; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Commerce and Exportation, Pt. 2, 
1992 Sess., p. 735, testimony of Joseph Brennan, vice president of legislative affairs for Connecticut Business and Industry 
Association (""The Connecticut Antitrust Act, however, is inconsistent in its language and its application to federal antitrust law. 
The possibility of multiple enforcement by agencies applying different standards can create serious problems for businesses 
engaged in interstate commerce."")."
345,24," A brief review of the legislation and case law of other states demonstrates that had the legislature desired the wholesale 
incorporation of federal law into the state scheme, it could have done so. See Duck Tours Seafari, Inc. v. Key West, 875 So. 2d 
650, 653 (Fla. App. 2004) (""Under Florida law, 'Any activity or conduct . . . exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws of the 
United States is exempt from the provisions of this chapter [542].' ยง 542.20, Fla. Stat. (1995). Thus, the doctrine of state action 
immunity which has developed under federal antitrust law is also an available defense to a suit against a municipality for a 
violation of Florida's antitrust laws.""), review denied, Docket No. SC04-1382, 890 So. 2d 1114, 2004 Fla. LEXIS 2183 
(November 22, 2004); see also Dill v. Board of County Commissioners, 928 P.2d 809, 815-16 (Colo. App. 1996) (""any person 
exempt or immune under federal antitrust law is exempt from the Colorado Antitrust Act of 1992""). Moreover, statutes such as ยง 
35-44b do not necessarily counsel blind adherence to all things federal. See Fine Airport Parking, Inc. v. Tulsa, 2003 OK 27, 71 
P.3d 5, 10-11 (Okla. 2003) (acknowledging statute requiring state antitrust law to ""be interpreted and applied consistent with 
federal antitrust law,"" but stating that ""the principles of federalism supporting the Parker doctrine are meaningless in an analysis 
of municipal liability under [state antitrust statutes]"" because ""the state is the sovereign and the municipality is a political 
subdivision of the state""). "
346,25," The concurring opinion concludes that ""because ยง 35-31 (b) is more specific than ยง 35-44b, its terms should prevail in this 
case. Thus, there is no need to go beyond the plain and unambiguous language of the statute."" The concurrence further states 
that it ""sees no need"" for much of the analysis herein, including our ""lengthy"" explanation of how federal antitrust state action 
immunity relates to Connecticut's antitrust state action immunity. We take this opportunity to express briefly our respectful 
disagreement with much of the concurrence's analysis. We first note that the concurring opinion, while professing to follow strictly ยง 1-2z, in fact departs from the analysis directed by 
that statute by invoking the canon of statutory construction that provides, ""where statutes contain specific and general references 
covering the same subject matter, the specific references prevail over the general."" Galvin v. Freedom of Information 
Commission, supra, 201 Conn. 456. If the statutes at issue were in fact as plain and unambiguous as the concurrence states, 
resort toHN25[
]  this canon, which is itself a form of ""extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute""; General Statutes ยง"
346,1," -2z; simply would be unnecessary. Moreover, HN26[
] while canons certainly do have their place in the construction of 
statutes, it strikes us as unwise to elevate them over all other forms of ""extratextual evidence"" because, for almost every maxim 
found in the ""grab bag"" of canons, an equal and opposite proposition may be found. We have stated: ""Although the so-called 
canons of statutory construction may at times serve as useful tools in deciphering legislative meaning, to rely on any one of them 
as a compelling factor in the interpretive process is problematic, because as Professor Karl Llewellyn persuasively has 
demonstrated, 'there are two opposing canons on almost every point.' K. Llewellyn, 'Remarks on the Theory of Appellate 
Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed,' 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 401 (1950). The so-called 
'canons' are not that, at least in the sense that any one of them reliably can be determined to apply or not to apply in any given 
case. They are, instead, merely guides drawn from experience, to be employed or not to be employed carefully and judiciously, 
depending on the circumstances. See F. Frankfurter, 'Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,' 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 
544-45 (1947); see also United Illuminating Co. v. New Haven, 240 Conn. 422, 455, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). 'To permit them to 
displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields . . . would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the 
judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable 
public policies.' United Illuminating Co. v. New Haven, supra, 455."" Burke v. Fleet National Bank, 252 Conn. 1, 23-24, 742 A.2d 
293 (1999). We also disagree with the analysis contained in footnote 3 of the concurring opinion, namely, that ""federal antitrust law 
pertaining to state action immunity is more lenient than ยง 35-31 (b), but is just as specific. The reason that we should not follow 
federal law in this case is that the provisions of ยง 35-31 (b) are more specific than the provisions of ยง 35-44b and, therefore, to 
the extent that there is a patent inconsistency between the plain language of ยง 35-31 (b) and the federal law, the provisions of ยง 
35-44b requiring us to follow federal law do not apply."" We do not perceive the resolution of this case as turning on whether ยง 
35-31 (b) is more specific than ยง 35-44b, because the statutes fundamentally are different. Section 35-31 (b) is a substantive 
rule of law pertaining directly to the parties' conduct while, in contrast, ยง 35-44b evinces the legislature's intent with respect to 
the interpretation of substantive antitrust statutes like ยง 35-31 (b). The concurrence's analysis misstates the central issue herein, 
which is the applicability of ยง 35-44b, and to resolve that question, we necessarily must compare ยง 35-31 (b) and 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, 
to ascertain the relevant similarities and differences between the state and federal enactments."
346,26," We also note that adoption of the federal standard would diminish the strict construction that we give to the exceptions under ยง 
35-31, including ยง 35-31 (b). Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. v. Hartford, 270 Conn. 619, 628, 854 A.2d 1066 (2004), citing 
Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., supra, 169 Conn. 355. "
348,27," We note that further explication on this point by the trial court would have greatly aided our review of the market definition 
issue, and that the better practice would have been for the plaintiffs, who as the HN32[
] appellants bear responsibility for providing an adequate record for review, to move for an articulation pursuant to Practice Book ยง 66-5. Nevertheless, the 
plaintiffs' claim remains reviewable because: (1) the underlying facts are undisputed in light of the trial court's decision to treat 
the defendants' summary judgment motion as one of judgment on the pleadings; see footnote 5 of this opinion; (2) HN33[
] 
whether the trial court properly granted a motion for summary judgment is a question of law subject to de novo review; and (3) 
the relevant documents are part of the record on appeal. See Ammirata v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 264 Conn. 737, 744-45, 
745 n.10, 826 A.2d 170 (2003) (res judicata and collateral estoppel claims); Niehaus v. Cowles Business Media, Inc., 263 Conn. 
178, 185, 819 A.2d 765 (2003) (whether agreement was clear and unambiguous)."
348,28," We note that the applicable department of public health regulations also contemplate a wholesale market, as HN34[
] the definition of ""'available water'"" includes water supplied by contract, as well as that obtained through ""active sources . . . ."" Regs., 
Conn. State Agencies ยง 25-32d-1a (4). To be ""available,"" however, the contract must not be ""subject to cancellation or 
suspension . . . ."" Id."
348,29," We have reviewed the myriad of statutes and regulations cited by the defendants in the synopsis contained in their appendix, 
as well as those actually discussed in their brief. We do not, however, discuss all of them in this opinion because many are, 
despite their pervasive verbosity, nevertheless tangential or irrelevant to the issues discussed herein. "
349,30," We note that both the plaintiffs and the defendants engage in extensive discussions of the special act through which the 
General Assembly established the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority in 1967. See Special Acts 1967, No. 381. The 
plaintiffs rely on language in the special act that expressly mentions the authority of the Southeastern Connecticut Water 
Authority to obtain and sell water at wholesale to water utilities. See Special Acts 1967, No. 381, ยง 14 (h). The defendants, in 
contrast, rely on the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority's eminent domain power, which it received despite concerns of 
investor-owned water utilities that were expressed in committee hearings. See Special Acts 1967, No. 381, ยง 14 (c). We 
conclude that, although this special act supports the plaintiffs' contentions with respect to the distinction between wholesale and 
retail water markets; see part II A of this opinion; it is otherwise tangential to the present case because it does not provide water 
companies or municipalities with any relevant powers."
349,31," We note that the trial court's decision in the present case cited and quoted only ยง 25-33c in discussing the statutory and 
regulatory scheme, but acknowledged that the defendants provided it with a comprehensive synopsis of the entire scheme."
349,32," Accordingly, the legislature also gives the department of public health jurisdiction over ""all matters concerning the purity and 
adequacy of any water supply source used by any municipality, public institution or water company for obtaining water, the 
safety of any distributing plant and system for public health purposes, the adequacy of methods used to assure water purity, and 
such other matters relating to the construction and operation of such distributing plant and system as may affect public health."" 
General Statutes ยง 25-32 (a). By way of illustration, the defendants cite several examples of the department of public health's extensive jurisdiction over water 
companies and their properties, such as the requirement of a written permit for the transfer, lease, assignment or change in the 
use of watershed lands. See General Statutes ยง 25-32 (b), (c), (d) and (e). Moreover, a water company may not agree to sell 
water reserves in excess of what it needs to provide adequate services without a permit to do so from the department of public 
health. General Statutes ยง 22a-358. Similarly, a water company may not abandon a water supply source without approval of the 
department of public health, which shall not be granted if that source would be necessary in an emergency or ""the proposed 
abandonment would impair the ability of such company to provide a pure, adequate and reliable water supply for present and 
projected future customers,"" for fifty years from the date of application. General Statutes ยง 25-33k (c) (2). Indeed, a water company desiring to sell even a potential or abandoned source of water must notify the department of public 
health, which shall order that company to notify ""other water companies that may reasonably be expected to utilize the source, 
potential source or abandoned source of its intention and the price at which it intends to sell such source. . . ."" General Statutes 
ยง 25-33 (a). That statute also prescribes a procedure for other water companies to buy that source, and empowers the 
department of public health to determine who may buy the source if it is desired by multiple water companies. General Statutes 
ยง 25-33l (b). "
350,33," General Statutes ยง 25-33h (a) provides: ""Each water utility coordinating committee shall prepare a coordinated water system 
plan in the public water supply management area. Such plan shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Public Health for his 
approval not more than two years after the first meeting of the committee. The plan shall promote cooperation among public 
water systems and include, but not be limited to, provisions for (1) integration of public water systems, consistent with the 
protection and enhancement of public health and well-being; (2) integration of water company plans; (3) exclusive service areas; 
(4) joint management or ownership of services; (5) satellite management services; (6) interconnections between public water 
systems; (7) integration of land use and water system plans; (8) minimum design standards; (9) water conservation; (10) the 
impact on other uses of water resources; and (11) acquisition of land surrounding wells proposed to be located in stratified 
drifts."""
350,34," General Statutes ยง 25-32d (e) directs notice and the content thereof to municipalities when water companies submit a plan or 
revised plan that ""involves a forecast of land sales, abandonment of any water supply source, sale of any lands, or land 
reclassification . . . ."""
350,35," General Statutes ยง 25-32d (d) requires the department of public health to adopt implementing regulations, ""in consultation 
with"" the department of environmental protection and the public utilities control authority, and that ""such regulations shall include 
a method for calculating safe yield, the contents of emergency contingency plans and water conservation plans, the contents of 
an evaluation of source water protection measures, a process for approval, modification or rejection of plans submitted pursuant 
to this section, a schedule for submission of the plans and a mechanism for determining the completeness of the plan. . . ."" "
351,36," Agency regulations implementing ยง 25-32d prescribe a process for the submission, completion and approval of the plan. 
Section 25-32d-5 (c) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides a timeline for the process by which the 
department of public health consults with the department of environmental protection and the department of public utility control. 
Section 25-32d-5 (c) (3) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies requires the commissioner to approve, reject, or 
approve the plan ""with conditions"" within sixty days of department of environmental protection or department of public utility 
control comment, or if there has been no such comment, ""in no case more than one hundred and fifty days after written notice

351,37," General Statutes ยง 25-33h (b) prescribes a procedure for the adoption of the plan, and requires that the committee seek

353,38," The defendants rely heavily on the phrase ""totality of the mandate,"" as coined by Judge Covello in Professional Ambulance 
Service, Inc. v. Blackstone, 35 Conn. Sup. 136, 143, 400 A.2d 1031 (1978), in support of their argument that the water supply 
statutes, in sum, ""specifically commanded or directed"" their conduct. We emphasize, however, that ยง 35-31 (b) immunity 
requires a statute that addresses the challenged conduct directly and explicitly, and accordingly, is not triggered by implication 
alone."
353,39," HN40[
]  Trial court opinions are, ""although entitled to serious consideration . . . not binding authority in this court."" 
Commission on Hospitals & Health Care v. Lakoff, 214 Conn. 321, 333, 572 A.2d 316 (1990). Nevertheless, the trial court cases 
discussed herein provide particularly cogent illustrations of the correct application of ยง 35-31 (b), and their inclusion is warranted 
because that issue has been addressed only once on the appellate level, by this court's decision in Mazzola. "
354,40," The trial court in Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Blackstone, supra, 35 Conn. Sup. 138-39, stated that the mayor's 
actions were ""the product of the implementation of a series of state regulations promulgated by the Connecticut department of 
health in furtherance of the emergency medical services program authorized by General Statutes [ยง ] 19-73u et seq. [now 
General Statutes ยง 19a-175 et seq.]. [General Statutes ยง ] 19-73ee [now General Statutes ยง 19a-183] authorizes the 
establishment of a series of regional emergency medical service councils. The council for the geographic area which includes 
East Hartford is known as the North Central Emergency Medical Services Council. . . . ""Among their other duties, those councils are required by state regulation to designate so-called 'Primary Service Areas' for the 
various communities within their region. A primary service area . . . is simply a defined or known geographic area. [Sections] 19-
73w-404 (B) and 19-73w-400 (D) [of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] both require that within each primary 
service area there shall be only one firm assigned for a given category of service."" The court also noted ยง 19-73w-307 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provided: ""'Ambulance services 
shall not advertise emergency medical services or emergency personnel for any political subdivision which has designated a 
phone number to be used to obtain EMS [Emergency Medical Service]. . . .'"" Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. 
Blackstone, supra, 35 Conn. Sup. 140 n.5."
354,41," The court dismissed the Sherman Act counterclaims after conducting a separate analysis pursuant to Parker v. Brown, supra, 
317 U.S. 341, and its progeny. Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, Inc. v. Galante, supra, 136 F. Supp. 2d 21, 2000 WL

355,42," General Statutes ยง 7-273bb (b) gives powers to municipal and regional resource recovery authorities and provides: ""It is the 
intention of this chapter that the authorities shall be granted all powers necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter and to 
carry out their assigned responsibilities and that the provisions of this chapter are to be construed liberally in furtherance of this 
intention."" See also General Statutes ยง 7-273bb (a) (12) (recovery authority may ""do all things necessary for the performance of 
its duties, the fulfillment of its obligations, the conduct of its operations, the maintenance of its working relationships with the 
state, other municipalities, regions and persons, and the conduct of a comprehensive program for solid waste disposal and 
resources recovery, and for solid waste management services, in accordance with the provisions of the state or local solid waste 
management plan, applicable statutes and regulations and the requirements of this chapter"")."
355,43," In contrast, we note Interstate Aviation, Inc. v. Meriden, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven at Meriden, Docket No. 
CV92-0240874S (May 26, 1995), wherein the plaintiff unsuccessfully bid on the opportunity to operate a municipal airport. The 
plaintiff brought an action against the city and the successful bidder, claiming violations of municipal competitive bidding laws 
and antitrust statutes. With respect to the antitrust claims, the city claimed immunity pursuant to ยง 35-31 (b), and moved for 
summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment, relying on Mazzola and concluding that the statute, 
General Statutes ยง 13b-43, provided only that ""any municipality . . . may establish, maintain and operate an airport at any 
location within the state approved by the commissioner and by the municipality or municipalities within which such airport is to be 
established, and may take any land or interest therein necessary for such establishment at such location upon paying just 
compensation to the owner of such land or interest therein. . . ."" The court stated that theHN41[
]  ""use of the term 'may' does 
not support the notion that such action is specifically directed or required by statute,"" and also that because the enabling 
legislation provided for acquisition of competitors, but only ""in exchange for payment, it 'very clearly negates any defense claim 
of entitlement to impunity or immunity.'"" Interstate Aviation, Inc. v. Meriden, supra. "
356,1," General Statutes ยง 35-31 (b) provides: ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said 
activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States."""
356,2," General Statutes ยง 35-44b provides: ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, 
inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."""
356,3," The majority applies this principle to conclude that ยง 35-31 (b) should apply over the more general provisions of the Sherman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, as construed by the federal courts. I disagree. Federal antitrust law pertaining to state action immunity is 
more lenient than ยง 35-31 (b), but is just as specific. The reason that we should not follow federal law in this case is that the 
provisions of ยง 35-31 (b) are more specific than the provisions of ยง 35-44b and, therefore, to the extent that there is a patent 
inconsistency between the plain language of ยง 35-31 (b) and the federal law, the provisions of ยง 35-44b requiring us to follow 
federal law do not apply. I recognize that ยง 35-44b requires us, as a threshold matter, to compare the plain language of ยง 35-31 
(b) with the relevant federal law to determine whether such an inconsistency exists in the first instance. Once it has been 
determined that such an inconsistency exists, however, we are no longer bound by ยง 35-44b in construing the meaning of ยง 35-
31 (b). The majority argues that my analysis is internally inconsistent because the canon of statutory construction providing that specific 
statutes prevail over more general statutes is, itself, a form of ""'extratextual evidence . . . .'"" I disagree. I believe that ""we may 
apply the ordinary canons of judicial construction in seeking the plain meaning"" of the statutory scheme. (Emphasis added.) 
State v. Courchesne, 262 Conn. 537, 634, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (Zarella, J., dissenting, joined by Sullivan, C. J.). Thus, this 
canon informs us, before we ever look to federal law, that if there is an inconsistency between federal law and ยง 35-31 (b), ยง 35-
31 (b) prevails over ยง 35-44b. Finally, the majority argues that the canon providing that the specific prevails over the general does not apply because ยง 35-31 
(b) and ยง 35-44b are fundamentally different. At the heart of the majority's analysis, however, is its recognition that the general 
rule that we follow federal precedent when interpreting the Connecticut Antitrust Act does not apply when the specific text of our "
357,," antitrust statutes requires us to do otherwise. See Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, 235 Conn. 1, 15-16, 
664 A.2d 719 (1995). This is an application of the very canon that the majority purports to reject. Thus, my disagreement with the 
majority is not with its general approach to the issue or its conclusion, but with its apparent unwillingness to state simply and 
explicitly that, because the language of ยง 35-31 (b) is plain and unambiguous, we are bound by that language and, because ยง 
35-31 (b) is more specific than ยง 35-44b, we are not bound by ยง 35-44b. "
362,1," As described at length in the LePage's litigation, 3M's bundled rebate programs provided purchasers with significant discounts 
on 3M's products. However, the availability and size of the rebates were dependant upon purchasers buying products from 3M 
from multiple product lines. See LePage's II, 324 F.3d at 154-55."
362,2," On August 18, 2004, the Court certified as a class ""all persons who directly purchased invisible or transparent tape from 3M 
between October 2, 1998 and the present, who have not purchased, for resale under the class member's own label, any 'private 
label' invisible or transparent tape from 3M or any of 3M's competitors at any time from October 2, 1988 to the present."" (August 
18, 2004 Memorandum and Order.) "
363,3," Throughout this opinion the Court will use the phrase ""issue preclusion"" and ""collateral estoppel"" interchangeably. See 
Witkowski v. Welch, 173 F.3d 192, 198 (3d Cir. 1999) (noting that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now commonly referred to 
as issue preclusion)."
363,4," For the sake of simplicity, the Court will refer to the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel as ""collateral estoppel"" 
and ""offensive collateral estoppel"" when addressing the legal rule which governs the preclusive effect of a prior judgment in this 
case. See Raytech Corp. v. White, 54 F.3d 187, 190 n.5 (3d Cir. 1995). "
365,5," In its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Bradburn had asked the Court to establish through the application of collateral 
estoppel that 3M's predatory or exclusionary conduct during the relevant period included: a) 3M's rebate programs, such as Executive Growth Fund, Partnership Growth Fund, Brand Mix Program; b) 3M's Market Development Fund, and other payments to customers conditioned on customers achieving certain sales 
goals or growth targets; c) 3M's efforts to control, or reduce, or eliminate private label tape; d) 3M's efforts to switch customers to 3M's more expensive branded tape; and e) 3M's efforts to raise the price consumers pay for Scotch tape. The Court, however, declined to apply collateral estoppel to this issue because the jury in LePage's could have ""based its finding 
of predatory or exclusionary conduct on any one of the five examples alone,"" and thus ""none of the five alleged predatory or 
exclusionary practices were essential to the judgment in LePage's."" (03/30/2005 Memorandum and Order at 27.) "
367,6," The Court notes that this amendment to the March 30, 2005 Memorandum and Order has no impact on this Court's 
determination that the application of collateral estoppel in this case is fair to 3M and will serve judicial economy. See (03/30/2005 
Memorandum and Order at 27-41.) "
372,1," It would seem that an implication of Microsoft's contention that Novell lacks antitrust standing as to the claim asserted in Count 
I is that Sun and Netscape also lacked antitrust standing to the extent that they were not direct competitors in the operating 
system market, i.e., owners of alternative operating systems, but rather developers of middleware products that threatened to 
render Microsoft's operating system obsolete. Even if that is not so, however, I am satisfied that for the reasons I have stated, 
Novell may (just as Netscape and Sun did) assert antitrust claims for harm allegedly caused to its non-operating system 
products as a result of Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior designed to protect its Windows monopoly."
372,2," As Novell notes, several courts have glimpsed at the record in the government suit in order to evaluate the comparability of the 
government and private actions. See, e.g., Morton's Market, 198 F.3d at 830-32. That approach, however, does not provide any 
greater support for Novell than does a simple comparison of its complaint and the complaint in the United States' action against 
Microsoft. The record in the government suit confirms that while an occasional expert may have referred to abuses that occurred 
in related software markets, those references did not result in any charge of monopolization or attempted monopolization in the 
office productivity applications market. Indeed, the greatest difference between the complaint in the government action and the 
ultimate resolution of the case was that whereas the complaint alleged anticompetitive behavior both in the operating system 
market and in a browser market, the Court of Appeals ultimately found that the evidence did not substantiate the existence of the 
latter market. United States v. Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 81-81 (D.C. Cir. 2001). "
373,3," That such a charge could have been asserted certainly was not unknown. State Attorney Generals originally included a claim 
for harm for a market for office productivity applications in the complaint they filed. (See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft 
Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)). Of course, the filing of this claim did not toll limitations 
because section 16(i) applies only to actions brought by the United States. In any event, within two months the Attorney 
Generals abandoned that claim when filing an amended complaint. (See First Amended Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft 
Corp., No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed July 17, 1998)). "

387,5, The district court rulings on Section 1 claims were not appealed in either Microsoft or Dentsply. 
388,6," The Court recognizes that absent Wyeth's concession on this point, a careful analysis of the existence of monopoly power is 
required. See generally, Re/Max Int'l, Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1018-1019 (6th Cir. 1999). The Court also 
acknowledges that its concession will not prohibit Wyeth from challenging plaintiffs' allegation of its monopoly power in the event 
of a trial in this case."

389,8," The CVS/RiteAid expert Keith Leffler admitted in his deposition that the ""more significant thing"" in his analysis was the market 
share rebate, rather than the ""sole CE"" clause. See Leffler Deposition at p. 163-164. The Court does not view this testimony as 
limiting the CVS/RiteAid claim to Wyeth's rebate clauses, as Wyeth suggests. "

426,11," On December 23, 1999, Dr. MacArthur was informed by Cleal Bradford of the SJHSD that he had been granted ""temporary"" 
privileges, which would last from December 23 through January 5, 2000, while his request for full provisional privileges was 
being considered. According to the defendants, when Dr. MacArthur first discussed his ""temporary"" privileges with Mr. Bradford, 
Bradford asked Dr. MacArthur to specify the number of patients that Dr. MacArthur thought he would treat during the temporary 
privilege period. When Dr. MacArthur indicated that it would be difficult to estimate exactly, Bradford told MacArthur to increase 
his estimate to cover any potential but unplanned patients. Defendants insist that Dr. MacArthur's ""temporary privileges"" did not 
carry any limitation  [**20] on the actual number of patients that Dr. MacArthur could see during the ""temporary"" privileges 
period--but the same may not be true of the number of patients he could treat at SJHSD facilities. On January 10, 2000, Dr. 
MacArthur's ""temporary"" privileges were extended from January 5, 2000, through January 25, 2000. On January 26, 2000, Dr. 
MacArthur was again granted an extension through February 2, 2000. "
427,12," While working under the supervision of Drs. Redd and Jones at the Blanding Urgent Care Center, plaintiffs allege that ""Mrs. 
Lyman did the following patient procedures: a) Took care of acute head trauma's; and, b) Put in chest tubes; and, c) Delivered a couple of babies; and, d) Sutured cuts; and, e) Dealt with heart attacks; and, f) Informed families of tragedies; and, g) Ordered tests; and, h) Prescribed medications and shots; and, i) Prescribed tests to be run on the patients; and, j) Admitted and discharged patients; and, k) Consulted  [**25] other specialists by phone; and, l) Treated patients with infectious diseases; and, m) Referred patients to the San Juan Hospital and to the other district facilities, all without a Dr. at her side and without on site supervision, and with no Dr. even in town available for assistance. (Proposed Amended Complaint at 55-57 P129.) However, plaintiffs then allege that ""Mrs. Lyman and Dr. Key, before he left, 
informed Dr. Redd and Dr. Jones that this practice of leaving Mrs. Lyman without either Dr. on call was wrong, and that the 
practice should be changed,"" (id. at 57  P130), and now characterize that practice as a ""Violation of Medical ByLaws and State

428,14," At pretrial, however, counsel insisted Drs. Penn and Mena continued to supervise Ms. Lyman at a distance even after Dr. 
MacArthur left for Nevada--concededly doing do at that point without SJHSD privileges--and that when Drs. Penn and Mena no 
longer supervised her, Ms. Lyman ""went to work under Dr. Jones,"" and therefore ""there was never a time that she wasn't without

defendant named ""Laurie Walker""--in reality, Lori Wallace, R.N., a former SJHSD employee who was working in the San Juan 
Hospital emergency room on April 14, 1999 when plaintiff Helen Valdez was there seeking treatment. ( See Answer to Complaint 
by Laurie Walker (Lori Wallace), filed September 25, 2000 (dkt. no. 46) (name correction noted on docket).)"
430,26," Commissioner Redd was a member of the SJHSD Board for a brief period in late 1998 and early 1999, and Commissioner 
Lewis was a member from late 1998 to mid-1999. (Proposed Pretrial Order at 67 P2.)"
430,27," ""County Commissioner Ty Lewis made the statement and determination in a public meeting that the County would drive out 
qualified private competitors,"" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 29 P135); ""in  [**37] areas of health care, Commissioner Ty Lewis is 
against a private entity that would or will compete with the District."" ( Id. at 20 P50; Proposed Amended Complaint at 34 P50 
(same)). "
431,28," Plaintiffs assert that ""Cleat Bradford and James Redd had access to District board members and County Commissioners and 
the County Attorney as relatives and close friends, in a highly rural and isolated area,"" whereas plaintiffs MacArthur and Lyman 
did not. (Proposed Pretrial Order at 32 PP151-152.)"
431,29, Plaintiffs allege that
431,223," . [On] December 21, 1999 Ms. Lyman Attended San Juan Health Care Services board Meeting to discuss and attempt 
to resolve her problems with SJHSD staff with the SJHSD board. She requested to have a public meeting so the public 
could fully understand the issues involved in the health care system their tax dollars support."
431,224," . SJHSD governance board chairman Roger Atcitty stated that he and SJHSD Patsy Shumway and SJHSD Karen 
Adams had discussed the situation before the official meeting and had decided that the grievance meeting with SJHSD "
432,," governance board would be private. Such a decision being made before the meeting and without public input appears to be 
in violation of Utah's Open Meeting law. (cmplt. # 162-168). (Proposed Amended Complaint  [**40] at 83-84 PP223-224; see Proposed Pretrial Order at 57 P223-224 (same).) John Housekeeper did do some investigation for Mrs. Lyman, but labeled Dr. MacArthur a troublemaker because Dr. 
MacArthur was perceived by him to be associated with his current counsel in a lawyer/client relationship when Dr. 
MacArthur appeared at the District Board meeting in December, 1999. ( Id. at 22.) Mrs. Valdez, Dr. MacArthur, Mrs. Lyman informed the District of their problems and to no avail. Dr. MacArthur and others 
reporting problems to Board member Patsy Shumway and John Housekeeper were labeled either troublemakers or Dr. 
Redd detractors. (Proposed Pretrial Order at 14.) The Defendant community leaders Rick Bailey, Ty Lewis, John Lewis, Karen Adams, Cleal Bradford, with the power and 
authority over the entire district, did nothing to investigate, find and hold accountable the responsible parties, and carried 
out a state identified de facto policy that diminished the standard of care for the patients. ( Id. at 27 P112(b).)"
432,30," Concerning Mr. Housekeeper, the Proposed Amended Complaint alleges that Ms. Lyman ""suffered from Dr. Redd driving by 
her home honking his horn,"" and relates that ""the horn honking  [**41] subsided notably when John Housekeeper was notified as 
board member that it was going on and was asked to tell Dr. Redd to stop the honking."" (Proposed Amended Complaint at 17, 
22-23.) Plainly this scenario would not serve as a basis for any liability on the part of Mr. Housekeeper. "
433,31," Plaintiffs also allege that ""Dr. MacArthur had an incident report allegedly filed against him by Marilee Bailey, Julie Bronson, 
Laurie Shafer, Cleal Bradford that was never discussed  [**45] with him or placed in his District file, and is a report that he 
considers to be untrue."" (Proposed Amended Complaint at 39 P88; Proposed Pretrial Order at 25 P96 (same).) "
435,32," On ""February 1, 2000 Carla Grimshaw calls Ms. Lyman's office to say that Ms. Lyman and Dr.  [**51] MacArthur need to be at 
Medical staff Meeting in the a.m. at 0800. Ms. Grimshaw states nothing about their privileges being an agenda item, or that 
medical staff would making any decisions about those privileges."" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 58-59 P229.) "
436,33," According to plaintiffs, With the exceptions of Dr. Jones and a Monument Valley clinic doctor, all other physicians and P.A.'s 
within San Juan District are employees of San Juan District."" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 20 P43.) "
439,34," More recently, plaintiffs' counsel has invoked the Utah Antitrust Act, Utah Code Ann. ยงยง 76-10-911 through 76-10-926 (2003), 
in addition to the federal antitrust statutes. (Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff MacArthur's Motion for the Court to Reconsider 
its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Claims and Plaintiffs' Cross- Motion for Summary Judgment, filed November 23, 2004 (dkt. no. 
670), at 4.)"
439,35," Plaintiffs' counsel now refers to ""civil and criminal defamation with malice,"" apparently invoking Utah Code Ann. ยง 76-9-404 
(2003) in addition to the common law theories. (Id.)"
439,36," Plaintiffs' counsel would now extend this theory to reach interference with a plaintiff's ""right to pursue his profession and 
business affairs by lack of good faith and fair dealing inherent and mandated in all Utah business relations."" (Id.) "
440,37," The statute of limitations applicable to civil RICO actions is the four-year limitations period governing civil enforcement actions 
under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15b. See, e.g., Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 
S. Ct. 2759, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1987); Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1273 n. 12 (10th Cir. 1989)."
440,38," ""The various acts of racketeering activity described in the statute are often referred to as 'predicate acts' because they form 
the basis for liability under RICO."" BancOklahoma Mortgage Corp., 194 F.3d at 1102 (citing Bacchus Industr., Inc. v. Arvin 
Industr., Inc., 939 F.2d 887, 891 (10th Cir. 1991)).  [**68] Plaintiffs' counsel also refers to ""(d) illegal destruction or tampering with confidential documents in a federally contracted facility;"" 
and ""(e) intimidation of witnesses for monetary gain,"" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 3 P(5)), but these are not found among the 
offenses enumerated in the statute's definition of ""racketeering activity"" and thus cannot serve as RICO predicate acts. 18 
U.S.C. ยง 1961(1) (""racketeering activity"" defined). "
442,39," HN20[
] Section 1512 addresses specific affirmative coercive or misleading conduct intended to inhibit or influence future witness testimony or the availability of evidence yet to be offered in a pending or future federal proceeding. See United States v. 
Rose, 362 F.3d 1059, 1067-1068 (8th Cir. 2004); United States v. Davis, 357 F.3d 726, 728-729 (8th Cir. 2004),  [**76] vacated 
on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1099, 125 S. Ct. 1049, 160 L. Ed. 2d 993 (2005) (mem.); United States v. Romero, 54 F.3d 56, 62 
(2d Cir. 1995) (""knowing interference with a potential communication between an individual who might become a witness and 
federal law enforcement officials falls within the ambit of Section 1512. We have thus previously noted that the statute covers 
'potential' witnesses. United States v. Hernandez, 730 F.2d 895, 898 (2d Cir. 1984) ('[section] 1512 explicitly covers ""potential""

with the intent to cause the witness to withhold future testimony"")."
442,40," More recently, plaintiffs' counsel has asserted that Dr. MacArthur and Ms. Lyman suffered retaliation in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 
1513 for having informed the SJHSD's governance board of remarks made by SJHSD administration and staff concerning Dr. 
Nathaniel Penn being a ""little New York Jew."" (See Plaintiff MacArthur's Motion for the Court to Reconsider its Motion to Dismiss 
Plaintiff's Claims and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, filed November 23, 2004 (dkt. no. 670), at  [**77] 17); 
Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff Lyman's Motion for the Court to Reconsider its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Valdez' [sic] 
Discrimination Claims and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, filed December 28, 2004 (dkt. no. 696), at 24.) HN21[ ] Section 1513 prohibits violent retaliation (e.g., killing, attempting to kill, causing bodily injury, damaging tangible property) "
443,," against any person for attending or furnishing testimony or evidence in a federal proceeding or providing information to a law 
enforcement officer ""relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense. โฆ"" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1513(a), (b). 
Plaintiffs have alleged no federal proceeding, no reporting of a federal offense, and no violent retaliation. Even ยง 1513(e), which 
prohibits ""interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person for providing to a law enforcement officer any 
truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense,"" simply cannot be read to reach 
the reporting of ethnic remarks to a local hospital's governance board. Counsel's assertion that ยง 1513 was violated by conduct so plainly outside the clear language of the statute raises 
 [**78] serious concerns under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. "
444,41," Plaintiffs assert that Ms. Lyman's patients ""were told that even in an emergency they would not be seen by the District if they 
continued to visit Mrs. Lyman  [**84] for health care. Mrs. Lyman believes threatening patients that emergency care will be 
denied in an emergency is extortion of the lowest kind."" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 63 P255.) A threat of denial of emergency 
medical care by a public facility may be found to be improper for a number of reasons, but such a threat does not constitute 
""extortion"" within the meaning of the Hobbs Act."
444,42," The potential for abuse of the civil RICO remedy was recognized some years ago: ""'Given the resulting proliferation of civil 
RICO claims and the potential for frivolous suits in search of treble damages, greater responsibility will be placed on the bar to 
inquire into the factual and legal bases of potential claims or defenses prior to bringing such suit or risk sanctions for failing to do 
so.'"" Chapman & Cole v. Itel Container Int'l, 865 F.2d 676, 685 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 201, 107 L. Ed. 
2d 155 (1989) (quoting Black & Magenheim, Using the RICO Act in Civil Cases, Houston Law.  , Oct. 1984, at 20, 24-25 (Oct. 
1984)). "
445,43," Section 248(a)(3) also prohibits conduct which ""intentionally damages or destroys the property of a facility, or attempts to do 
so, because such facility provides reproductive health services, or intentionally damages or destroys the property of a place of 
religious worship."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 248(a)(3)."
445,44," As the case proceeded, Ms. Valdez' EMTALA and HCQIA claims were specifically dismissed on motion by her own counsel. 
(See Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss, filed November 25, 2002 (dkt. no. 463).) As written,  [**89] that motion moved ""for an order 
dismissing the defendants' motions to dismiss EMTALA and Health Care Quality Improvement Act claims, due to mootness"" -- 
apparently making what amounted to a motion to strike the defendants' moving papers. (Id. (emphasis added); see Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss Plantiffs' EMTALA Claims, filed November 13, 2002 (dkt. no. 447).) The Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss was not 
accompanied by an explanatory memorandum. However, as docketed, calendared and heard, the Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss was treated as a motion to dismiss Ms. Valdez' 
EMTALA and HCQIA claims as moot: THE COURT: โฆ Many of the items that we dealt with before have heretofore been resolved. I do note that plaintiff's motion 
to dismiss the EMTALA and Health Care Quality Improvement Act Claims, docket number 463, filed November 25th are "
446,," now moot and I take it ought to be, you don't have any problem with that determination, your motion, that is you're 
dismissing those claims? MS. ROSE: Uh, yes. THE COURT: Isn't that right, the EMTALA and Health Care Quality Improvement Act claims? MS. ROSE: That would be fine. THE COURT: It was your motion and I think we can grant that at this point without further  [**90] ado. . (Transcript of Hearing, dated January 7, 2003, at 4:23-5:10 (emphasis added).) The dismissal of plaintiff's EMTALA and HCQIA 
claims was duly noted in the Minute Entry. (See Minute Entry, dated January 7, 2003 (dkt. no. 480) (""Grants, motion to dismiss 
(Dkt # 463)."" See also Transcript of Hearing, dated February 24, 2003, at 30:19-31:8 (The Court).)"
446,45," HCQIA ยง 412 reads in part: (a) HN28[
] In general. For purposes of the protection set forth in section 11111 (a) of this title, a professional review action must betaken- (1) in the  [**91] reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care, (2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter, (3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures 
as are fair to the physician under the circumstances, and (4) in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain 
facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph (3). A professional review action shall be presumed to have met the preceding standards necessary for the protection set out in 
section 11111 (a) of this title unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence."
446,42, U.S.C. ยง11112(a) (2000).
446,46," 11 of HCQIA provides: (1) HN29[
] Limitation on damages for professional review actions If a professional review action (as defined in section 11151 (9) of this title) of a professional review body meets all the 
standards specified in section 11112 (a) of this title, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section- (A) the professional review body, (B) any person acting as a member or staff to the body, (C) any person under a contract or other formal  [**92] agreement with the body, and (D) any person who participates with or assists the body with respect to the action, shall not be liable in damages under any law of the United States or of any State (or political subdivision thereof) with 
respect to the action."
446,42," U.S.C. ยง 11111 (2000) (emphasis added). HN30[
] Section 11111 makes an express exception as to liability under ""any law of the United States or any State relating to the civil rights of any person or persons, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 "
447,," U.S.C. 2000e, et seq. and the Civil Rights Acts, 42 U.S.C. 1981, et seq."" and for actions by the Attorney General under the 
federal antitrust laws. Id."
447,47," Subsection (d) of ยง 1395dd reads: HN35[
] (2) Civil enforcement "
448,," (A) Personal harm Any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a participating hospital's violation of a 
requirement of this section may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain those damages available for 
personal injury under the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and such equitable relief as is appropriate: (B)  [**96] Financial loss to other medical facility Any medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a 
participating hospital's violation of a requirement of this section may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, 
obtain those damages available for financial loss, under the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and such 
equitable relief as is appropriate. (C) Limitations on actions No action may be brought under this paragraph more than two years after the date of the 
violation with respect to which the action is brought."
448,48, Plaintiffs' counsel now points to two paragraphs out of 523 in the original Complaint as invoking the EMTALA civil remedy:
448,365," . In violation of EMPTALA [sic] and COBRA violations Mrs. Valdez was not examined, checked, asked what her 
problem was, nor had her temperature and blood pressure checked  [**98] while Mrs. Valdez was in such a condition."
448,*, * * *
448,377," . Mrs. Valdez had a right to expect an examination by a Dr. Of her choice at San Juan Hospital at the time of 
presentment with her malady pursuant to her insurance contracts and EMPTALA [sic] and COBRA statutes and 
regulations. (Complaint (Verified), filed July 25, 2000 (dkt. no. 1), at 108-109 PP365, 377.) Besides the fact that neither paragraph accurately 
states an EMTALA requirement, the original Complaint makes no reference to EMTALA or COBRA in its extended statement of 
the plaintiffs' ""Causes of Action,"" (id. at 118-154 PP443-523). Clearly, the original Complaint did not give fair notice to the SJHSD of any claim of liability under EMTALA, even if one had been 
intended. "
449,49, Her EMTALA claim fails on its merits as well. (See infra at 109 & n. 81.)
449,50," The remaining language of this section gives limited statutory authority for beneficiaries to contract for health care services, 
e.g., with managed care networks. 42 U.S.C ยง 1395a(b). "
450,51," 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 (2000) was originally enacted as part of the HN42[
] Civil Rights Act of 1866, Act of April 9, 1866, ch. 31,"
450,14," Stat. 27, the first of the Reconstruction Era civil rights acts, and was grounded upon the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified a 
year earlier. The provision was re-enacted in 1870, two years after the ratification  [**105] of the Fourteenth Amendment. See. 
Act of May 31, 1870, ch. 114, ยง 16, 16 Stat. 144. It was amended more recently by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-

 [**111]"
452,54," See 1 Nahmod, supra, at ยง 3:2: Different Fourteenth Amendment violations (and hence Bill of Rights violations) require different states of mind, apparently 
because of the language and history of the applicable constitutional provisions. For example, equal protection violations "
453,," require purposeful discrimination, Eighth Amendment violations require deliberate indifference, and due process violations 
require more than mere negligence. The Supreme Court finally made clear the distinction between ยง 1983 and the 
underlying constitutional violation in Parratt v. Taylor when it held that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, ยง 1983 
imposed no independent state-of-mind requirement  [**113] for the prima facie case, in contrast to state-of-mind 
requirements for the violation of particular constitutional provisions themselves. [Footnotes omitted.]"
453,55," Plaintiffs also assert their reliance upon a due process guarantee in the provisions of the Health Care Quality Improvement 
Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 11112 (2000), discussed infra. "
454,56," More recently, counsel argued that ""[a] repeated pattern of a government entity's conduct is a de facto 'silent' policy enabling 
[individual defendants] to ultra vires arbitrarily deny a plaintiff of his liberty and property rights,"" that ""careful or heightened 
scrutiny attaches when these liberty and property rights are compromised by government,"" and that the federal civil rights acts 
are ""designed to specifically cure a situation wherein the officials refuse  [**120] to enforce provisions of the law."" (Memorandum

doctor was a medical staff member and then only if the physician was in the same town as she."
457,33," . While the policy for P.A.s appears neutral, it effected only Michele Lyman in how it was applied, monitored, and carried 
out."
457,*, * * *
457,209," . Dr. Penn and Ms. Lyman attended the Medical staff Meeting for June, 1999. Dr. Penn and Ms. Lyman requested full 
privileges be restored and Dr. Redd and Jones both stated that only if Dr. Penn was willing to sit in Blanding with Ms. 
Lyman while Ms. Lyman took ER call and they would not supervise me. Mr. Bryant as a P.A. working under Dr. Jones while 
Dr. Jones was not in Blanding, had no such restraints. Mrs. Lyman pointed out that she covered the ER (Blanding urgent 
care clinic) in Blanding by herself on many occasions. There was no response. (Cmplt. 137-145) Staff had previously voted 
for her privileges and then the County, Board, and medical staff did nothing while District staff Ora Lee Black, Dr. Redd, 
Gloria Yanito denied her the same. Some privileges as to labs and exrays were eventually restored. (Proposed Amended Complaint at 31 PP31-33; 78 P209; see  [**130] Proposed Pretrial Order at 18 PP31-33; 54 P209 (same).) Recounting that the medical staff ""passed a policy saying in order to have privileges your supervising physician has to be in the 
same town,"" Ms. Lyman's counsel asserted that she did not see ""where the governing board adopted that policy so it was an 
action taken by medical staff but under the bylaws the governing board is the body that sets the policy."" (Tr. 11/15/02, at 15:7-24 
(Ms. Rose).) Apparently the argument is that the SJHSD Board adopted a ""policy"" of letting the medical staff make ""policy"" 
concerning Physician Assistants' staff privileges, but that it did so without any formal Board action."
457,58," Plaintiffs also allege that ""as a policy and pattern of practice, those who inform those in power of problems are subjected to 
reputation assassination within the area."" (Id. at 17.) "
458,59," HN62[
] Once a defendant raises a the defense of qualified immunity, ""the burden shifts to the plaintiff [to] satisfy a heavy 
two-part burden"" to ""demonstrate that the defendant violated a constitutional or statutory right[,]"" and ""'that the right at issue was 
clearly established at the time of the defendant's unlawful conduct.'"" Gross v. Pirtle, 245 F.3d 1151, 1155, 1156 (10th Cir. 2001). 
If the plaintiff cannot make both showings, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity; if he can, the burden shifts to the 
defendant ""to prove that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law."" Id. at 1156."
458,60," The Supreme Court has expressly held that HN63[

461,64," In Hayman, the Court stated that the only protection claimed here is that of appellant's privilege to practice his calling. However extensive that protection 
 [**144] may be in other situations, it cannot, we think, be said that all licensed physicians have a constitutional right to 
practice their profession in a hospital maintained by a state or a political subdivision, the use of which is reserved for 
purposes of medical instruction. It is not incumbent on the state to maintain a hospital for the private practice of medicine. Hayman v. City of Galveston, 273 U.S. 414, 416-417, 71 L. Ed. 714, 47 S. Ct. 363 (1927)."

wages for women and children in private employment, without reference to the pursuit of a particular line of employment. See id. 
at 545-546 (""the right to contract about one's affairs is a part of the liberty of the individual protected by this [Due Process] 
clause,"" and although ""there is, of course, no such thing as absolute freedom of contract[,] โฆ freedom of contract is, 
nevertheless, the general rule, and restraint the exception, and the exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified 
only by the existence of exceptional circumstances""), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 81 L. Ed. 703, 
57 S. Ct. 578 (1937). The Court has long since abandoned Adkins' expansive view of freedom of contract. See Planned 
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 860, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992). "
462,66," In arguing the denial of procedural due process, Dr. MacArthur's counsel retreated somewhat from her substantive due 
process theory: THE COURT: Okay. Well your idea is that in rural areas a doctor with a medical degree and a medical license has 
unrestricted power to practice in a local hospital? MS. ROSE: No, Your Honor, it is subject to what is called peer review. It is subject to notice and due process and that's 
verified in 42 U.S.C. 11112 โฆ. Tr. 11/14/02, at 31:25-32:5.) In counsel's view, the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 11112, discussed supra, 
""requires that if you're going to limit or deny privileges to a doctor you do it with adequate and fair notice and due process."" (Tr. 
11/14/02, at 33:7-9 (Ms. Rose).) As noted above, ยง 411 of the HCQIA,42 U.S.C. ยง 11111, encourages the use of peer review 
procedures in supervising physicians' practice privileges by immunizing the review participants from civil liability arising from a 
review action (with specific exceptions)  [**148] if that action meets ยง 11112's procedural criteria. The HCQIA does not impose 
due process requirements on hospitals and health care facilities; it provides an incentive for the adoption of notice-and-hearing 
procedures by the facilities themselves. Section 11111(a)(1) does not immunize peer review participants from liability under the 
federal civil rights acts, including 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. "
463,67," The Utah courts have also entertained contractual ""due process"" claims involving the limitation or revocation of practice 
privileges at private hospitals based upon notice-and-hearing requirements found in hospital bylaws. See, e.g., Rees v. 
Intermountain Health Care, Inc., 808 P.2d 1069 (Utah 1991); Houston v. Intermountain Health Care, Inc., 933 P.2d 403, 408 
(Utah Ct. App. 1997). In this case, Dr. MacArthur and Ms. Lyman have not pleaded such claims based upon the SJHSD 
 [**152] medical staff bylaws, instead choosing to attack the validity of the bylaws themselves. See infra note 104. "
464,68," This statutory definition has been in effect since its enactment in 1997. See 1997 Utah Laws ch. 229, $ 11. "
465,69," Starting from the  [**159] premise that ""while working for Dr. Redd, Mrs. Lyman applied for and received privileges with the 
District, with the same scope of privileges as Dr. Redd,"" (Proposed Pretrial Order at 27 P117; see id. at 39 P127 (""Mrs. Lyman's 
scope of privileges was originally for duties equal to Dr. Redd's.""), Ms. Lyman alleges that after leaving Dr. Redd's supervision in 
October, 1998, her privileges were restricted in several respects: ""Mrs. Lyman could not admit or discharge patients without first 
her supervising doctor initially and officially and physically signing off on the patient's admit or discharge,"" (id. at 48 P169); she 
was told on one occasion in December 1998 that she could not give orders to SJHSD staff, (id. at 48-49 P170); later that same 
day, she was told she ""could use the lab and xray only during Dr. Penn's office hours, [and that] otherwise Ms. Lyman did not 
have privileges,"" (id. at 49 P186 (emphasis in original); ""later the limited privileges of lab and exray [sic] were extended to her for 
her patients as required by State law,"" (id. at 49 P187), but in September 1999, her secretary was told ""that Ms. Lyman would 
not be allowed to order labs until Ms. Lyman sent a letter to  [**160] Dr. Redd stating who her supervising physician was."" (Id. at 
55 P213). (See Proposed Amended Complaint at 55 P127; 69-70 P11 169-170; 70-71 P1 186-187; 79-80 P213 (same); Tr.

patient was denied (id. at 49 P185); on at least two occasions, her request for patient medical records was refused by Dr. Redd, 
(id. at 50-51 PP189, 193-194); despite an understanding with the SJHSD medical staff concerning injections, ""Ms. Lyman tried 
on several occasions to call in injections to the โฆ ER (Blanding Urgent Care Clinic) and was denied every time. Ms. Lyman 
always had to call Dr. Penn's office and have him call the order in requests to the Blanding Urgent Care Center for injections for 
patients were denied by SJHSD staff,"" (id. at 54-55 P210). (SeeProposed Amended Complaint at 70-73 PP185, 189, 193-194, 
210 (same); Tr. 11/15/02, at 16:10-17:5, 21:19-21, 22:5-14, 26:12-25, 30:4-31:6, 39:3-40:12; compare supra n. 12.)"
465,70," Substantive due process  [**161] requires that a termination, suspension, denial or restriction of a plaintiff's practice privileges 
not be ""'arbitrary, capricious, or without a rational basis.'"" Tonkovich v. Kansas Bd. of Regents, 159 F.3d 504, 528 (10th Cir. 
1998) (quoting Brenna v. Southern Colo. State College, 589 F.2d 475, 477 (10th Cir. 1978)). The Tenth Circuit recently reiterated the standards for evaluating substantive due process claims: In analyzing plaintiff's substantive due process claim, the court assumes plaintiff's employment was an interest entitled 
to protection. In Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567 (10th Cir. 1995), we stated that ""the standard for judging a substantive 
due process claim is whether the challenged government action would 'shock the conscience of federal judges.'"" Id. at "
466,573," (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992)) (further 
quotations omitted). To ""satisfy the 'shock the conscience' standard, a plaintiff must do more than show that the 
government actor intentionally or recklessly caused injury to the plaintiff by abusing or misusing government power."" 
Id. at 574. Rather, a plaintiff ""must demonstrate a degree of outrageousness and  [**162] a magnitude of potential or 
actual harm that is truly conscience shocking."" Id. Babbar v. Ebadi, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 11798, 2000 WL 702428, at *10 (10th Cir. 2000). Ferraro v. Board of Trustees of Labette County Medical Center, 106 F. Supp. 2d 1195, 1202 (D.Kan. 2000)."
466,71," Ms. Lyman also asserts that she ""had sought privileges ever since they were de facto terminated by district policy after she 
began working for Dr. Penn, having left the practice of Dr. Redd,"" in October 1998, (Proposed Amended Complaint at 40 P91), 
but her specific factual allegations reflect that she continued to exercise her privileges through 1999. The scope of her privileges 
was the subject of discussion involving Ms. Lyman, Dr. Penn and the SJHSD medical staff in which it was acknowledged by the 
medical staff that Ms. Lyman could, inter  [**164] alia, request x-rays, lab work and injections for patients, and could continue to 
exercise privileges under local physician supervision. See supra at n. 69. In December of 1999, she requested renewal of her 
existing privileges, which had a renewal date of December 22, 1999. (See Tr. 11/15/02, at 49:6-52:6 (Ms. Rose).) Whether certain SJHSD nurses or other employees interfered with the exercise of her existing privileges is another matter, (see 
Proposed Pretrial Order at 14 (""Privileges for Mrs. Lyman were de facto denied by nursing personnel and medical staff without 
any action by the District governance board."")), raising potential claims of breach of contract or the implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing, or interference with contract. "
467,72," Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993), clarified the elements of a claim for 
gender, discrimination resulting from a hostile work environment. The Supreme Court held that conduct within the purview of 
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000e-1 et seq., must be severe or pervasive enough to create both ""an 
objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile""--and an 
environment the victim-employee subjectively perceives as abusive or hostile. Id. at 21-22. Whether an environment is ""hostile"" 
or ""abusive"" is determined by looking at the totality of circumstances, such as ""the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its 
severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; โฆ whether it unreasonably interferes 
with an employee's work performance""; and the context in which the conduct occurred. Id. at 23. Additionally, the Harris Court 
specifically noted that any relevant factor ""may be taken into account, [but] no single factor is required."" Id. "
468,73,"  If a plaintiff can show a constitutional violation by someone acting under color of state law, then the plaintiff has a cause of 
action under Section 1983, regardless of Title VII's concurrent application. See Owens v. Rush, 654 F.2d 1370, 1380 (10th 
Cir. 1981)  [**170] (""Title VII did not impair in any way [plaintiff's] independent, substantive rights created by the First and 
Fourteenth Amendments . . . . 'Substantive rights conferred in the 19th Century were not withdrawn, sub silentio, by the 
subsequent passage of the modern statutes.'"") (quoting Great Am. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 377, 
99 S.Ct. 2345, 2351, 60 L. Ed. 2d 957); Day v. Wayne County Bd. of Auditors, 749 F.2d 1199, 1205 (6th Cir. 1984) (""Where 
an employee establishes employer conduct which violates both Title VII and rights derived from another source--the 
Constitution or a federal statute โฆ the claim based on the other source is independent of the Title VII claim, and the plaintiff 
may seek the remedies provided by ยง 1983 in addition to those created by Title VII.""); cf. Meade v. Merchants Fast 
Motorline, Inc., 820 F.2d 1124, 1127 (10th Cir. 1987) (""plaintiff may properly pursue his cause of action under ยง 1981 for 
private employment discrimination despite the applicability of Title VII to the same conduct""). Starrett v. Wadley,876 F.2d 808, 814 (10th Cir. 1989)."
468,74," ""To be successful, section 1983 claimants must make two showings to establish that the conduct at  [**171] issue constituted 
state action. 'First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of 
conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible.' Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 
937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). 'Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be 
said to be a state actor.' Id."" Nieto v. Kapoor, 268 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2001)."
468,75," State action under ยง 1983 can occur when a supervisor ""participates in or consciously acquiesces in sexual harassment โฆ by 
co-workers."" Murrell v. School Dist. No. 1, 186 F.3d 1238, 1250 (10th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks and citation omitted)."
468,76," At that time, Dr. Redd was also a member of the SJHSD medical staff, and at different times in 1996 may have served as chief 
of staff. (See Tr. 11/15/02, at 3:20-22 (Ms. Rose). Dr. Redd's conduct as the SJHSD chief of staff may be state action under ยง 
1983. See, e.g., Nieto v. Kapoor, 268 F.3d 1208, 1215-1217 (10th Cir. 2001) (non-employee medical director of hospital 
department acted under color of state law for purposes of ยง 1983 ""when undertaking his supervisory duties over plaintiffs' work"" 
in that department and was ""a state actor for purposes of section 1983.""). Yet plaintiffs do not allege that Dr. Redd was acting as 
the SJHSD chief of staff--not as a private employer engaged in a private medical practice--in making the alleged derogatory 
remarks to Ms. Lyman and others who worked for him. (See Proposed  [**173] Amended Complaint at 60-68 PP145-166.)"
468,77, (Proposed Amended Complaint at 60 P143.) 
469,78," Ms. Lyman would not have standing to bring a ""hostile environment"" claim under either Title VII or ยง 1983 for verbal abuse 
occurring after October or November of 1998 because at that point she was no longer employed by Dr. Redd. She was working 
with and being supervised by Dr. Penn; after she left Dr. Redd's supervision in 1998, Dr. Redd's derogatory remarks--rude, 
offensive, antagonistic and unprofessional as they may have been--could not alter the terms, conditions, or privileges of Ms. 
Lyman's subsequent employment."
469,79, ( See supra at 59-60.) 
470,80," Claims of class-based discrimination against a non-minority plaintiff based upon association with the plaintiff's minority spouse 
have met with mixed results. Compare,  [**178] e.g., Davis v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Authority, 924 F.2d 51 (3d Cir. 
1991) (plaintiff white police officer married to African-American spouse prevailed on ยง 1983 anti-discrimination claim arising out 
of officer's discharge from employment), with University Village Music Center v. Seattle School Dist., 844 F.2d 793 (Table), 
1988 WL 33365, (9th Cir. 1988) (unpublished disposition) (conclusory allegations that the defendants discriminated against 
plaintiff's business because his former wife is of Japanese descent insufficient to state a ยง 1983 claim). "
471,81," This being so, Ms. Valdez was not denied or refused the screening, examination or stabilizing treatment for an ""emergency 
medical condition"" required by EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395dd(a), and has no arguable legal claim arising  [**181] from a violation 
of that statute. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395dd(d). ( See supra at 56-58.)"
471,82," Counsel now argues the existence of a County ""policy or custom"" of disparate treatment of ""people of color,"" relying largely on 
hearsay assertions of anecdotal evidence. ( See Memorandum of Points and Authorities Supporting Plaintiff Valdez's Motion for 
the Court to Reconsider its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Valdez' Discrimination Claims and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary 
Judgment, filed October 26, 2004 (dkt. no. 665), at xii, 18-19.)  [**182] This claim was neither pleaded through specific 
allegations in the Proposed Amended Complaint nor raised as an issue in the Proposed Pretrial Order."
471,83," Muzquiz v. W.A. Foote Memorial Hosp., Inc., 70 F.3d 422, 429 (6th Cir. 1995) (witness' ""subjective belief that minorities would 
be treated differently at the hospital was simply not probative of a discriminatory animus""). "
472,84," Ms. McCready, a subscriber to a group health care plan who had been denied reimbursement by the plan for the cost of 
services of a clinical psychologist, brought her suit under ยง 4, alleging that the plan had conspired with a professional association 
of physicians and psychiatrists to exclude psychologists from receiving payment under the plan for outpatient treatment of 
mental disorders, including psychotherapy in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act.457 U.S. at 467-70. The Court concluded that 
""the injury she suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the 
psychotherapy market. In light of the conspiracy here alleged we think that McCready's injury 'flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful . . . and falls squarely within the area of congressional concern."" Id. at 484 (footnote omitted). "
476,85," As the court of appeals recently elaborated: It is not enough that a plaintiff wishes to have the moral satisfaction of a judicial ruling that he was right and his adversary 
was wrong; the relief sought must have legal effect in determining the present and future rights and obligations of the 
parties. ""The crucial question is whether  [**202] 'granting a present determination of the issues offered . . . will have some 
effect in the real world.'"" Citizens for Responsible Gov't State Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174, 1182 
(10th Cir. 2000), quoting Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. Becker, 186 F.3d 1261, 1266 (10th Cir. 1999); see also Colorado 
Off-Highway Vehicle Coalition v. United States Forest Serv., 357 F.3d 1130, 1133 (10th Cir. 2004) (""A 'case or controversy' 
no longer exists when it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatsoever to a prevailing party.""); Air Line 
Pilots Assn., Int'l v. UAL Corp., 897 F.2d 1394, 1396-97 (7th Cir. 1990) (the test is whether the relief sought would ""make a 
difference to the legal interests of the parties (as distinct from their psyches, which might remain deeply engaged with the 
merits of the litigation)""). Utah Animal Rights Coalition v. Salt Lake City Corp., 371 F.3d 1248, 1263 (10th Cir. 2004). "
477,86," The source of judicial authority to grant relief in ""appropriate circumstances"" in Utah is the common law:"
477,20," . We begin by identifying the source of our authority to award damages for constitutional violations. Except for the 
Takings Clause, the Utah Constitution does not expressly provide damage remedies for constitutional violations. Thus, 
aside from the Takings Clause, there is no textual constitutional right to damages for one who suffers a constitutional tort. 
Nor has the legislature enacted any laws authorizing damage claims for constitutional violations in general, or the violation 
of the Due Process Clause or the Open Education Clause in particular. Thus, there is no express statutory right to damages "
478,," for one who suffers a constitutional tort. In the absence of applicable constitutional or statutory authority, Utah courts 
employ the common law. See Utah Code Ann. ยง 68-3-1 (1996). Under the common law, ""individuals had access to 
remedies of money damages for violations of their individual rights, and these rights, enumerated in fundamental 
documents, were the forerunners of many of the provisions adopted in federal and state bills of rights."" Bott, 922 P.2d at 
739  [**210] (citations omitted). Hence, a Utah court's ability to award damages for violation of a self-executing 
constitutional provision rests on the common law. The Restatement (Second) of Torts supports this view. Restatement 
section 874A states that when no specific remedy is mentioned, a court may accord an appropriate remedy to one injured 
from the violation of a constitutional provision. See Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 874A & cmt. a (1979). Comment (g) to 
section 874A suggests that a court's authority to do so arises from the common law. See id. cmt. g, at 306-07; see also 
Jennifer Friesen, State Constitutional Law ยง 7-5(c) (2d ed. 1996) (stating that section 874A espouses a common law 
doctrine)."
478,21," . This common law ability to award damages for constitutional violations requires policy decisions by the court, and it 
should be aware of them and face them candidly. . . . The court is not required to provide the civil remedy, and yet judicial 
tradition gives it the authority to do this under appropriate circumstances. The court has discretion and it must be careful to 
exercise that discretion cautiously and soundly. Restatement ยง 874A cmt. d, at 303. Spackman ex rel. Spackman v. Board of Educ. of Box Elder County School Dist., 2000 UT 87, PP20-21, 16 P.3d 533, 537-538

discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchasers involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or 
resale within the state and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to "

or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them."

diverting trade from a competitor or otherwise injuring a competitor, impairs and prevents fair competition, injures public 
welfare, is unfair competition contrary to  [**216] public policy and the policy of this act and is declared to be a violation of 
this act. See also Utah Code Ann. ยง 13-5-9 (2001) (selling goods in quantity below cost); Utah Code Ann. ยง 13-5-10 (2001) (advertising

480,90," In Trade Comm. v. Skaggs Drug Centers, Inc., 21 Utah 2d 431, 446 P.2d 958 (Utah 1968), the Utah Supreme Court upheld 
the constitutionality of the Utah Unfair Practices Act, and elaborated upon its purpose: It has been argued that the purpose of statutes such as the Utah Unfair Practices Act is to preserve a competitive climate 
by preventing large business concerns through the unrestrained use of size and resources alone, from overwhelming and 
destroying their smaller competitors. These statutes it is claimed seek to preserve the right of a competitor to enter a 
market and compete with those already operating. It has been further argued that unrestrained price cutting on a massive scale has had disastrous effect on the small 
independent retailer with limited resources. That the below cost selling has become a weapon in the fight for markets and 
customers, characterized  [**217] by the deliberate use of below cost selling to undercut, overwhelm and destroy 
competition, all to the benefit and further enrichment of the big interests. It is further claimed that to correct the 
unscrupulous conduct of these vested groups it became necessary for government to adopt such unfair trade practices acts 
as the one here in question."
480,*, * * * 
481,," We do not suggest that a purpose to divert or capture a competitor's business is wrong or unethical. It is perfectly legitimate 
so long as it is not carried out unfairly. The legislature simply has declared it unfair to accomplish it through giving away 
goods or services or selling them for less than cost. Id., 21 Utah 2d at 438, 441, 446 P.2d at 962-963, 965 (footnote omitted)."
481,91," Utah Code Ann. ยง 13-5-17 (2001) reads: Policy of act. The Legislature declared that the purpose of this act is to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of 
monopolies and to foster and encourage competition, by prohibiting unfair and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest 
competition is destroyed or prevented. This act shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be subserved."
481,92," Under Utah Code Ann. ยง 13-5-14 (2001): Any person or the state of Utah may maintain an action to enjoin a continuance of any act in violation of this chapter, and, if 
injured by the act, for the recovery of damages. If, in such action, the court finds that the defendant is violating or has 
violated any of the provisions of this chapter, it shall enjoin the defendant from a continuance of the violation. It is not 
necessary that actual damages to the plaintiff be alleged or proved. In addition to such injunctive relief, the plaintiff is 
entitled to recover from the defendant three times the amount of the actual damages sustained or $ 2,000, whichever is 
greater, plus court costs. "
482,93," This statute was first enacted by the Utah Legislature in 1965, (1965 Utah Laws ch. 174), a watershed year for civil rights,

485,98," At the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights, Madison's comments in Congress also reveal the perceived need for some sort of constitutional ""saving clause,"" which, 
among other things, would serve to foreclose application to the Bill of Rights of the maxim that the affirmation of particular 
rights implies a negation of those not expressly defined. See 1 Annals of Cong. 438-440 (1789). See also, e.g., 2 J. Story, 
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 651 (5th ed. 1891). Madison's  [**233] efforts, culminating in the 
Ninth Amendment, served to allay the fears of those who were concerned that expressing certain guarantees could be read 
as excluding others. Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 579-80, 100 S. Ct. 2814, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973 & n.15 (1980) (Burger, C.J.) 
(plurality opinion)."
485,99," The Supreme Court has rejected the assertion of reputation as a discrete interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. Reputation alone--apart from some more tangible interests such as employment-does not implicate 
 [**235] any ""liberty"" or ""property"" interests sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause; hence, to 
establish a claim under ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, more must be involved than simply defamation by a state 
official. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701-712, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976). [A plaintiff's] interest in reputation is simply one of a number which the State may protect against injury by virtue of its tort 
law, providing a forum for vindication of those interests by means of damages actions. And any harm or injury to that "
486,," interest, even where, as here, inflicted by an officer of the State, does not result in a deprivation of any ""liberty"" or ""property"" 
recognized by state or federal law, nor has it worked any change of respondent's status as theretofore recognized under 
the State's laws. For these reasons, we hold that the interest in reputation asserted in this case is neither ""liberty"" nor 
""property"" guaranteed against state deprivation without due process of law. Id.at 712."
486,100," Under Utah law, private civil damages action for common-law defamation are subject to a one-year statute of limitations: ""An

rumors allegedly being circulated about them by one or more of the individual defendants contemporaneously with the rumors' 
circulation. For Dr. MacArthur, the pertinent events  [**237] transpired between October 1999 and March 2000, at which time he 
relocated to Nevada. Ms. Lyman may have a timely claim for defamatory falsehoods that were known or reasonably 
discoverable after July 25, 1999, but some of the events of which she complains may have taken place before that date."
486,101," Utah Code Ann. ยง 78-12-25(1) (2002) provides that ""an action may be brought within four years:"" (1) upon a contract, obligation, or liability not  [**238] founded upon an instrument in writing; also on an open account for 
goods, wares, and merchandise, and for any article charged on a store account; also on an open account for work, labor or 
services rendered, or materials furnished; provided, that action in all of the foregoing cases may be commenced at any time 
within four years after the last charge is made or the last payment is received;"
486,102," Wagner defined an ""adhesion contract"" as ""'a contract entered into between two parties of unequal bargaining strength, 
expressed in the language of a standardized contract, written by the more powerful bargainer to meet its own needs, and offered 
to the weaker party on a ""take it or leave it basis. . . .""'"" 786 P.2d at 766 n.2  [**239] (quoting Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., 65 Cal.2d 
263, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 107, 419 P.2d 168, 171 (1966)). "
488,103," According to Justice Nehring, author of the Smith v. Grand Canyon Expeditionsopinion: The implied covenant is by its very nature a pliable doctrine. It is inherently amorphous and evades definitional precision. 
These traits place the implied covenant directly at odds with predictability of conduct, the most basic and cherished 
characteristic of the contracts which the implied covenant was created to serve. As one commentator observed, ""While the 
varieties of good faith are not quite as infinite as those of religious faith, it would be quite extraordinary if this protean 
concept were used in the same sense in all . . . assorted instances."" Farnsworth, E. Allan, Good Faith Performance and 
Commercial Reasonableness Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 30 U. Chi. L.Rev. 666, 668 (1968). However, this answer is unsatisfactory to many who share the view made evident in the dissent that the implied covenant 
can too easily turn away from being an ally of contract law and become its antagonist.  [**244] This happens when courts 
mishandle the subtle but important distinction between invoking the implied covenant to compel a contracting party to honor 
the ""agreed common purpose"" and ""justified expectations' of another party to the contract, Restatement Second of 
Contracts ยง 205 cmt. a (1979), and injecting it to ""establish new, independent rights or duties not agreed upon by the 
parties"" or to ""nullify a right granted by a contract to one of the parties."" Brehany v. Nordstrom, 812 P.2d 49, 55 (Utah 
1991). The parties can reduce the risk that a court will remake their contract and award one party ""benefits for which it did not 
bargain,"" . . . by bargaining for terms that limit the exercise of unfettered discretion by one party or that otherwise clearly 
articulate the purposes and expectations of the parties. In short, the parties to a contract are best served when they fill their 
own gaps. Eggett v. Wasatch Energy Corp., 2004 UT 28, P 43-45, 94 P.3d at 204 (Nehring, J., concurring)."
488,104," If these allegations were intended to refer to the SJHSD medical staff bylaws that govern medical practice at District facilities, 
the reference is well-hidden. Under Utah law, it is understood that ""hospital bylaws constitute 'a contract between the hospital "
489,," and the physician,'"" and that ""the Hospital must comply with those bylaws when taking actions which effect its staff."" Houston v. 
Intermountain Health Care, Inc., 933 P.2d 403, 408 (Utah Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Rees v. Intermountain Health Care, Inc., 808 
P.2d 1069, 1076 (Utah 1991)). In contrast to Rees and Houston, the plaintiffs in this action do not seek to enforce the provisions of the SJHSD bylaws, or even 
to enforce the implied covenant of good faith and fair  [**247] dealing as an implied term of the bylaws ""contract."" They list no 
claim for breach of contract. Instead, they apparently contend that the SJHSD ""medical staff bylaws in and of themselves are 
""unconstitutional [unconscionable?], violative of covenants of good faith and fair dealing."" (Tr. 11/14/02, at 43:5-9 (Ms. Rose).) 
Yet this view of the medical staff bylaws would necessarily hold them to be unenforceable and of no legal effect-leaving plaintiffs 
MacArthur and Lyman with no procedural mechanism by which they could have obtained or maintained practice privileges at 
SJHSD facilities."

489,106," The terms ""confidentiality"" and ""privacy"" address distinct, yet overlapping concerns: ""In the context of health care, emphasis

491,109," Under Utah law, to prevail on a claim of public disclosure of embarrassing private facts, a plaintiff must establish the following 
essential elements: (1) the disclosure of the private facts must be a public disclosure and not a private one; (2) the facts disclosed to the public must be private facts, and not public ones; [and] (3) the matter made public must be one that would be highly offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person of ordinary

""illness"" results as well. ""Illness"" is ""an unhealthy condition of body or mind."" Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 566

496,120," Neither Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(1) nor the accompanying advisory committee notes articulate the legal standard to be applied in 
determining whether a claim or defense is ""frivolous"" within the meaning of the rule. The advisory committee note to the 1983 
amendment to Rule 16 makes general reference to a case from the D.C. Circuit, Meadow Gold Products Co. v. Wright, 108 
U.S.App.D.C. 33, 278 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1960). That case states that  [**277] ""the primary purpose of the pre-trial procedure is 
to 'define the claims and defenses of the parties for the purpose of eliminating unnecessary proof and issues, lessening the 
opportunities for surprise and thereby expediting the trial,'"" but does not speak of ""frivolous"" claims. 278 F.2d at 869 (quoting 
Rosden v. Leuthold, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 89, 92, 274 F.2d 747, 750 (D.C. Cir. I960)). Some guidance may be gleaned from case law construing analogous rule and statutory language, e.g., 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e) 
(2000). Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2) (claims and defenses ""warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the

government may not rely in its prosecution on facts beyond those stipulated. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 300 
(4th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, in resolving the contentions that defendants press on appeal, we take care not to rely on allegations 
that were not admitted in the plea agreements and the incorporated statement of facts. "
556,2," Indeed, it would appear that the reach of the immunity in ยง 1706(a)(2)(B) is not as broad as defendants assume. Gosselin and 
Pasha focus on the tariff disclosure dispensation they received, but the statutory provision clearly requires a reasonable belief in 
an exemption from ""any filing or publication requirement of"" the Shipping Act. ยง 1706(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Section 
1706(a)(2)(B) thus refers not only to ยง 1707 -- the tariff disclosure provision -- but also ยง 1704, which governs disclosure of 
""agreements."" And ยง 1704(a), by its terms, extends to agreements that ""control, regulate, or prevent competition in international 
ocean transportation."" ยง 1703(a)(6). The agreements secured during the course of defendants' scheme would qualify under this 
definition, making them subject to a ""filing or publication requirement of"" the Act under ยง 1706(a)(2)(B). But if this is so, 
defendants' would hardly have a ""reasonable basis to conclude that"" their ""activity or agreements"" were exempt from ""any"" 
disclosure provision of the statute, as they must to be immunized under ยง 1706(a)(2)(B). "
558,3," Because we reach this conclusion on the substance of defendants' immunity arguments, we need not address the 
government's alternative contention that the agreements for which Gosselin and Pasha seek immunity are beyond the coverage 
provisions of the Shipping Act and likewise beyond the FMC's jurisdiction. See ยง 1703; see also Tucor, 189 F.3d 834 (discussing 
a similar argument made in that case)."
558,4," One of the factors on which the district court rested its contrary determination was the ""rule of lenity."" Under this principle of 
interpretation, the application of ambiguous criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of a defendant. See, e.g., Rewis v. 
United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 28 L. Ed. 2d 493, 91 S. Ct. 1056 (1971). The Supreme Court has counseled, however, that 
there must be a ""genuine ambiguity"" before lenity will apply, Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 49 n.13, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199, 100 
S. Ct. 311 (1979), and has warned that no such ambiguity exists when ""the ambiguous reading relied on is an implausible 
reading of the congressional purpose."" Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 316, 141 L. Ed. 2d 303, 118 S. Ct. 2007 (1998). 
The Court has also directed that ""traditional tools of statutory construction"" should be consulted before ambiguity is found. Id. 
(citing United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S. Ct. 382 (1994)). Finding, as we do, that such 
""traditional tools,"" including ""congressional purpose"" and ordinary canons of statutory construction, suffice to resolve the 
interpretive issues before us, we see no occasion for resort to the rule of lenity. "
565,*," Judge Garwood recused himself after oral argument in this case. As a result, this opinion is being entered by quorum pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. ยง 46. "
566,1," Texas' electrical system is independent from the rest of the United States' which is administered through the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (""FERC""). PUCT fulfills a similar role as FERC. "
567,2," TCE does not challenge the district court's decision to dismiss their negligent misrepresentation and fraud claims under the 
filed rate doctrine. "
568,3," TCE also contends that the district court erred by ruling that only the U.S. Congress has the authority to determine the 
applicability of the filed rate doctrine and that the doctrine may only be abrogated through an amendment to the Sherman Act. 
The defendants, however, ""do not dispute that the Texas legislature, had it chosen to do so, could have repealed the application 
of the filed rate doctrine to cases brought under the TFEAA."" Since we conclude there is no evidence that the state legislature 
sought to eliminate this doctrine from state antitrust suits, this argument is moot. "
577,1," ""Alpha"" refers to the ability to add value over a benchmark. "
580,2," Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction is tied to these claims. Thus, the Court will consider both Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Preliminary Injunction and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment together."
580,3," Pitch books are advertising materials containing information about a particular business entity sent to prospective customers by 
the business entity to solicit business."
580,4," Plaintiffs incorrectly delineated their exhibit numbers on the Wilk Affidavit. Accordingly, the Court will cite to the actual exhibit 
numbers rather than the erroneous numbers contained in the affidavit. "
590,1," In Tampa Elec., the Supreme Court addressed the plaintiff's claims brought under ยง 3 of the Clayton Act. That section provides: It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to . . . make a sale or contract for sale of goods . . . on the condition, agreement, or 
understanding that the . . . purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods . . . of a competitor or competitors of the . . . 
seller, where the effect of such . . . sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to 
substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
590,15," U.S.C.  ยง  14. Plaintiff here has not asserted a claim under ยง  3 based on the EDAs, presumably because ยง  3 reaches only 
arrangements dealing with ""goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities,"" which are not at issue here. 
Id. The Court notes that in Tampa Elec., the Supreme Court stated that if an exclusive dealing arrangement ""does not fall within 
the broader proscription of ยง  3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the [Sherman Act]."" Tampa Elec., 
365 U.S. at 335 (citing Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608-609, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953). 
Professor Hovenkamp explains that ""a few courts have followed the rule suggested in Times-Picayune of applying a more 
aggressive test under the Clayton Act than under the Sherman Act, but most apply the same test under both statutes . . . 
Nevertheless, the cases are divided, with a likely majority stating that the Clayton Act requires a smaller showing of 
anticompetitive effects."" Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 2d P1800c4 (2005). See also Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. 
Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1304 (9th Cir. 1982) (""a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required to 
establish a Sherman Act violation than a section 3 Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases""). "
591,2," The plaintiffs in Kendall alleged that the associations' setting of merchant discount fees constitutes a horizontal price fixing 
arrangement in violation of ยง 1. "
592,3," Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has stated a claim for a horizontal conspiracy, it does not reach the issue of whether, 
without such a conspiracy, Plaintiff can aggregate the portion of the market foreclosed by each individual EDA in order to show 
that a ""significant fraction of buyers and sellers are frozen out of a market."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 45. "

price. Trinko, 124 S. Ct. at 879; Aspen Skiing, 105 S. Ct. at 2853. In upholding a verdict for the plaintiff, the Court in Aspen 
Skiing found significant that the HN10[

615,1," On January 4, 2005, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint omitting the claim under the Florida 
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act against all defendants. Plaintiff's other claims remain unaltered. The Court, on January 
31, 2005, granted leave to amend the Second Amended Complaint and applied the pending Motions to Dismiss (Doc. ##108-
111) to the Third Amended Complaint, with the exception of the arguments directed to FDUTPA, which became moot. (Doc.

621,9," Plaintiff urges the Court to find that plaintiff has standing to pursue injunctive relief because the law does not require an efficient 
enforcer under section 16. (Doc. #122, pp. 29-30.) The Court disagrees. Standing for injunctive relief under the antitrust laws 
requires that the plaintiff allege ""threatened injury that would constitute antitrust injury if inflicted upon the plaintiff and the 
defendant's causal responsibility for such threatened injury."" Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1452. Having found that plaintiff does not 
suffer from antitrust injury, the Court concludes that plaintiff does not have standing to seek injunctive relief."

684,*," The Honorable Myron H. Bright, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
685,1," Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 7-57-602: For the purpose of this part, ""private act hospital authority"" is any hospital owned or operated by one (1) or more local 
governments or any hospital, hospital authority or hospital district created or authorized by a private act of the general 
assembly."
685,2," Another named defendant, West Tennessee Healthcare, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hospital District."
685,3," The stated purpose of the Acts was: The general assembly hereby finds that the demand for hospital, medical and health care services is rapidly changing as is 
the way and manner in which such services are purchased and delivered; that the market for hospital and health care 
services is becoming increasingly competitive; and that the hospital and other health care providers need flexibility to be 
able to respond to changing conditions by having the power to develop efficient and cost-effective methods to provide for 
hospital, medical and health care needs. The general assembly also finds that the increasing competition and changing 
conditions force hospitals and other health care providers to develop market strategies and strategic plans to effectively 
compete. The general assembly further finds that public hospitals in metropolitan areas are presently at a competitive 
disadvantage, and that significant investments in the public assets of private act metropolitan hospital authorities could be 
jeopardized by inability to compete with private hospitals because of legal constraints upon the scope of their operations 
and limitations upon the power granted to public hospitals under existing law. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 7-57-501(b). "
686,4," The parties do not contest that the state action doctrine, if applicable, protects both the government entity - the hospital 
authority - and the private parties with whom it contracts - BlueCross. This is sensible, as the protection would be worthless in 
many cases if a plaintiff could simply sue private parties that contracted with the government."
686,5," After Hallie, the only requirement for sovereign immunity for political subdivisions is a clearly articulated state policy. Id. at 46. 
At one time, there was also an ""active state supervision requirement,"" but in Hallie the Supreme Court noted that this was 
primarily evidentiary and discarded this part of the test unless ""regulation by a private party"" is involved. Ibid. "
687,6," Both parties rely upon the opinion of the Tennessee Supreme Court in City of Cookeville ex rel. Cookeville Regional Med. Ctr. 
v. Humphrey, 126 S.W.3d 897 (Tenn. 2004). The Cookeville court faced the issue of whether the statute authorized a hospital 
authority to close its imaging department and then enter into an exclusive contract with a private provider. The Tennessee 
Supreme Court stated: [Tennessee statute] provides in pertinent part that a metropolitan hospital authority, in the exercise of its powers, may 
""contract for or otherwise participate solely or with others"" in furtherance of the hospital's operation. Additionally, the plain 
language of this statute permits private act metropolitan hospitals to enter into a contract ""regardless of the competitive 
consequences [of the contract]."" Therefore, it is clear that private act metropolitan hospital authorities are statutorily 
authorized to execute exclusive provider contracts. Id. at 902 (citations omitted)(emphasis in original). Cookeville does confirm that the ""regardless of"" clause applies to all the 
powers granted in ยง 7-57-502(a)-(b) and that those powers are quite broad. However, Cookeville did not involve an antitrust 
claim, and is therefore of limited usefulness in determining whether the ""regardless of"" phrase was meant to create an 
exemption from the antitrust laws."
687,7," This opinion was actually issued six days before the 1995 Act was passed (the then-draft language was the same as the 
enacted version). It therefore serves a dual role as legislative history and as the opinion of the Tennessee Attorney General at 
the time the bill was passed. "
698,1," Defendants also argued that this Court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state law claims and should not exercise pendent 
jurisdiction over those claims. Since, as discussed below, this Court has determined that the state law claims are preempted by 
the LMRA, these arguments need not be addressed. "
699,2," The fact that Local 117 has not raised a single employer claim distinguishes this case from Valley Engineers. In Valley 
Engineers, the Ninth Circuit recognized that ""a single employer finding must be supplemented by a unit clarification before the 
terms of a collective bargaining agreement can be imposed on an nonsigning entity."" 975 F.2d at 614. Since only the NLRB can 
conduct the unit clarification inquiry, the Court held that where a party asserts claims under both a single employer theory and an 
alter ego theory, the district court must defer to the NLRB on both issues. Id. Here, since no single employer claim has been 
raised, the NLRB's primary jurisdiction has not been triggered."
699,3, Sysco Seattle and Sysco Post Falls have appealed this finding. 
701,4," To prove tortious interference with contractual relationships, a plaintiff must show ""(1) the existence of a valid contractual 
relationship or business expectancy; (2) that defendants had knowledge of that relationship; (3) an intentional interference 
inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy; (4) that defendants interfered for an improper 
purpose or used improper means; and (5) resultant damage."" Leingang v. Pierce County Med. Bureau, Inc., 131 Wn.2d 133, 
157, 930 P.2d 288 (1997)."
701,5," California's tortious interference with contractual relations claim is substantively identical to Washington's. Compare, Leingang, 
131 Wn.2d at 157 with Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co., 50 Cal. 3d 1118, 1126, 270 Cal. Rptr. 1, 791 P.2d 587 
(1990)."
701,6," Because the tortious interference claim is preempted by ยง 301, this Court need not determine whether it would also be 
preempted under the Garmon preemption doctrine. "
709,1," For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the court accepts all well-pleaded allegations as true and draws all reasonable 
inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Travel All Over the World, Inc. v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 73 F.3d 1423, 1428 (7th Cir. 1996). "
710,2," Defendant also argues that collateral estoppel does not apply because the California court ""did not address 'identical' issues"" to 
those presented in the instant case. In its joinder motion filed with the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (""MDL""), however, 
defendant asserts that the instant case and Doe and Service Employees ""are based on identical facts and allege identical legal 
theories."" Judicial estoppel prevents a party that has taken one position in litigating a particular set of facts from later reversing 
its position when it is to its advantage to do so, if the party to be estopped has convinced the court to adopt its position. Levinson 
v. United States, 969 F.2d 260, 264 (7th Cir. 1992). Although at this point judicial estoppel does not strictly apply because the 
MDL has not ruled on the joinder and transfer motion, the court notes that defendant's positions regarding identical facts appear 
clearly inconsistent. Id. "
711,3," Although the court does not reach plaintiff's state law claims, it is clear that Judge Wilken's rulings on the California plaintiffs' 
state law claims, brought under California law, do not have a collateral estoppel effect on a court applying Illinois law. "
712,4," HN5[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2, prohibits monopolization or attempts to monopolize: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of 
the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . ."""
712,5," In plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss, he withdraws his claims for damages under Count I of his complaint, and now 
seeks only injunctive relief. "
722,1," As described at length in the LePage's litigation, 3M's bundled rebate programs provided purchasers with significant discounts 
on 3M's products. However, the availability and size of the rebates were dependant upon purchasers buying products from 3M 
from multiple product lines. See  LePage's II, 324 F.3d at 154-55. "
724,2," Although the parties have made some arguments with respect to the possible tolling of the statute of limitations in this case, 
which would extend the damages time period in this case. The Court notes, however, that it need not decide what the applicable 
period for the calculation of damages may ultimately be in ruling on the instant Motion.  In re K-Dur, 338 F. Supp. 2d at 551. 
Moreover, Meijer has advised the Court that ""there are additional arguments for further tolling,"" which it did not develop in the 
submission currently before the Court. (04/04/2005 Tr. at 40.) Accordingly, the Court will defer ruling on the propriety of tolling 
the statute of limitations at this time. "
726,3," The Court notes that it is ""not in a position to predict whether [Meijer] will ultimately be able to sustain [its] burden of proof on 
this issue since [Meijer] has not yet had an opportunity to obtain evidence.""  Brader, 64 F.3d at 876. Accordingly, the sufficiency "
727,," of Meijer's contentions regarding the effect of 3M's conduct on prices will be resolved ""after discovery, either on summary 
judgment or after trial."" Id. "
733,1, All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2001-02 edition unless otherwise indicated. 
734,2," There is a question whether Olstad is a proper class representative. At oral argument, Olstad's counsel asserted that if this 
court reversed the circuit court's order, he would substitute a new class representative. Because the circuit court ultimately 
dismissed Olstad's complaint, it never addressed the issue of whether to certify the class. We need not reach the issue for the 
purposes of determining this appeal."
734,3," Olstad asserts that the class consists of ""all persons or entities in the State of Wisconsin who purchased for purposes other 
than re-sale or distribution during the last six years, Microsoft licensed Intel compatible PC operating systems."" The class does 
not include government entities. Id."
734,4," ""Intel"" is a brand of microprocessor commonly used in personal computers. "
735,5," Olstad decided not to pursue the circuit court's dismissal of his claim under Wis. Stat. ยง 100.18, because he did not brief that 
issue to this court. Accordingly, we address only the issue certified by the court of appeals. "
736,6," The legislature revised this statute effective February 1, 2003, to alter its penalty provisions. The revision is not material to this 
appeal and we will not address it further. See 2001 Wis. Act 109. "
737,7," In its decision, the court did not declare the contract void. It remanded the case to the circuit court for Brown County.  Pulp 
Wood Co. v. Green Bay Paper & Fiber Co., 157 Wis. 604, 625, 147 N.W. 1058 (1914). The case was tried to the court, which 
dismissed the complaint on the ground that the contract was void ""because [the contract was] contrary to both the federal and 
state anti-trust statutes.""  Pulp Wood Co. v. Green Bay Paper & Fiber Co., 168 Wis. 400, 402, 170 N.W. 230 (1919). "
738,8," In its brief, the State argued that even though the respondent corporations were ""undoubtedly engaged in interstate commerce, 
they are subject to prosecution for violating the applicable Wisconsin Statutes by conspiring to fix and control the prices at which 
other defendants"" in Milwaukee sold calcium chloride to Milwaukee County. The State quoted  Leader Theatre Corp. v. 
Randforce Amusement Corp., 186 Misc. 280, 58 N.Y.S.2d 304, 307 (1945): ""It is now well established that states, under their 
police powers, can enact and implement legislation which affects interstate commerce, when such commerce has significant 
local consequences."" The State summed up: ""While there is no denying that the respondents are engaged in interstate 
commerce and that all of the calcium chloride sold in Wisconsin is shipped in interstate commerce, significant and necessary 
parts of this conspiracy are alleged to have been carried out in [Wisconsin], concern this state and are within the jurisdiction of 
our courts."" The three chemical companies answered: ""After the calcium chloride leaves the producing point no employee or agent of the 
respondent handles or has any contact with it."" The corporations continued: ""A corporation engaged in interstate commerce 
may, of course, be subject to state antitrust laws for violations which occur in connection with transactions which are wholly 
intrastate."" (Emphasis added.) The focused argument by the parties in  State v. Allied Chemical & Dye Corp., 9 Wis. 2d 290, 101 N.W.2d 133 (1960), put the 
court's decision in context."
738,9," In his dissenting opinion, Justice Nathan Heffernan wrote: It is well settled that a state may exercise its police powers through such devices as the antitrust laws even though an 
incidental benefit may be to local commerce, providing that the law or its operation do not discriminate against interstate 
commerce or disrupt its required uniformity. There is no intimation . . . that the Wisconsin antitrust laws are applied in a "
739,," discriminatory manner. It is equally clear that state antitrust laws can be enforced concurrently with, or in the absence of, 
federal regulation. State v. Milwaukee Braves, Inc., 31 Wis. 2d 699, 739, 144 N.W.2d 1 (1966) (Heffernan, Hallows, and Beilfuss, JJ., dissenting) 
(internal citations omitted)."
739,10," In  Thurlow v. Massachusetts, 46 U.S. 504, 12 L. Ed. 256 (1847), popularly known as ""The License Cases,"" the Court did not 
file a majority opinion; each Justice concurred separately. "
741,11," Roosevelt's predecessor, William McKinley, had initiated only three antitrust cases in four years of his presidency; Roosevelt 
initiated 45 cases during his eight years in office. Marc Winerman, The Origins of the FTC: Concentration, Cooperation, Control 
and Competition,  71 Antitrust L.J. 1, 16 (2003). "
742,12," The Legislature also made minor changes to what is now Wis. Stat. ยง 133.03 in 1923, 1945, 1947, 1957, 1969, and 1975. "
745,13," In  California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661 (1989), several states alleged violations of 
both federal and state antitrust law by an interstate monopoly of concrete block producers.  Id. at 97. The parties settled the 
case, but the federal judge administering the settlement refused to allow indirect purchasers to have access to the settlement 
fund because he believed that federal law preempted the state antitrust statutes.  Id. at 99. The Supreme Court held that the 
state ""repealer"" statutes were not preempted.  Id. at 101."
745,14," Wisconsin's Department of Justice has certainly interpreted the law as enabling it to reach activities in interstate--and even 
international--commerce. See Press Release, Wisconsin Department of Justice, Doyle Announces Historic Settlements With 
Vitamin Companies; Six Manufacturers Agree to Pay More Than $ 335 Million (Oct. 10, 2000), available at www.doj.state.wi.us. 
In the ""vitamin cases,"" Wisconsin led 23 states alleging that the six companies met in secret in locations ""around the world"" to fix 
vitamin prices, harming indirect purchasers. Id. The states alleged violations of ""state and federal law."" Id. The six companies 
involved are giants in international commerce, including BASF of Germany and Eisai Company of Japan. Id. Three of the 
companies were European and three were Japanese. Id. None was based in the United States, let alone Wisconsin. We recognize that the Department's conduct cannot, sua sponte, legitimize the underlying statute. However, it is persuasive 
evidence that in practice, commercial parties tacitly agree that Wisconsin's law may apply to interstate--even international--
commerce. "
747,15," The Alabama court's statement is remarkably similar to the language in Pulp Wood: ""The contract we think involved interstate 
commerce, and if so the federal statute is applicable and the case will be treated on that basis.""  Pulp Wood, 157 Wis. at 615."
747,16," We acknowledge that the Alabama Supreme Court subsequently interpreted the same statute differently.  Abbott Laboratories 
v. Durrett, 746 So. 2d 316, 337 n.5 (Ala. 1999). The Alabama court conducted an extensive review of the Supreme Court's 
commerce clause jurisprudence, as we have.  Id. at 330-32. It reached the same conclusion we have: that during the late 
nineteenth century, the theory of ""dual sovereignty"" or, as we have termed it, ""mutually exclusive spheres"" of power, was 
predominant. Id. However, the Alabama court adopted an originalist construction of the statute, giving great weight to the 
Alabama Legislature's intent at the time it enacted the Alabama statute.  Id. at 337 n.5. Specifically, the Alabama court relied on 
the presence of the phrase ""within this state"" in the original act. Id. The case here is different because, as we have discussed, 
our legislature repealed and recreated our antitrust act, expressly deleting all references to ""in this state,"" after our decision in 
Allied Chemical. "
755,1," We have examined a CID order once before and did so under discretionary review. Kohn v. State, 336 N.W.2d 292, 295-97 
(Minn. 1983). But we did not explain why discretionary review was selected or even discuss review as of right. Id. at 294."
755,2," HN5[
] At least three federal statutes specify that orders enforcing federal CIDs are appealable under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. See"
755,15," U.S.C. ยง 57b-1(h) (2000) (Federal Trade Commission's CID); 15 U.S.C. ยง 1314(e) (2000) (federal antitrust CID); 31 U.S.C. ยง 
3733(j)(5) (2000) (False Claims Act CID). We have not previously examined the appealability of attorney general administrative 
subpoenas issued pursuant to Minn. Stat. ยง 8.16 (2004) and express no opinion on the question here. But it is helpful for our 
present analysis to note that federal courts of appeals have held administrative subpoenas to be appealable as final decisions 
under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. See Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of N.J. v. Corrigan, 347 F.3d 57, 63 (3d Cir. 2003); United States v. Legal 
Servs. for New York City, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 83, 249 F.3d 1077, 1080-81 (D.C. Cir. 2001); In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 228 "
756,," F.3d 341, 345-46 (4th Cir. 2000); E.E.O.C. v. Citicorp Diners Club, Inc., 985 F.2d 1036, 1038 (10th Cir. 1993); Sheehan v. 
Doyle, 513 F.2d 895, 898 (1st Cir. 1975). A decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is particularly instructive. In In re 
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Co., the panel sua sponte asked the parties to argue whether an order involving an administrative 
subpoena was appealable under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291, as an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292 (2000), or under the 
collateral order doctrine. 214 F.3d 586, 589 (5th Cir. 2000). The panel concluded that appeal of right was most appropriate 
because ""an order enforcing an administrative subpoena is considered a final order."" Id. "
757,3," To the extent that our determination of whether the state's rights are substantial involves consideration of the likelihood that the 
state will prevail on the merits of the appeal, we observe that the district court's analysis underlying the CID order may not have 
been complete. The district court's conclusion that the state's request was precluded by the Protective Order or the 
Confidentiality Agreement does not consider that both documents specifically authorized the state to object to GSK's 
confidentiality designations and to seek district court review. The conclusion that the documents are not ""inactive investigative 
data"" under the MGDPA may answer the wrong question. HN10[
] The classification of inactive investigation data is relevant when a civil action is not brought. Minn. Stat. ยง 13.39, subd. 3 (2004). The pertinent question under the MGDPA may be whether 
commencement of the Ramsey County action makes the investigative data public. Id., subd. 2a. And the conclusion that there is 
a First Amendment privilege for ""petitioning documents"" is not clearly recognized in case law. "

795,2," Plaintiffs define ""American commerce"" as meaning U.S. imports, ""purely domestic"" commerce, and U.S. exports. "
796,3," In addition, the TAC does not seek class-wide damages arising from ""purely foreign"" commerce, as the definition of the 
proposed class includes only (a) ""all persons"" or other ""entities"" who purchased MIO in American commerce, and (b) ""all United 
States persons"" or other ""entities"" who purchased MIO in American or in purely foreign commerce. TAC P 72. In other words, 
plaintiffs do not seek to represent foreign plaintiffs who bought in purely foreign commerce. "
798,4," The MIO was imported from Japan into the United States by ISKM. Delta took possession of the shipment in Texas, and Cintas 
took possession in California. In both cases, Mexico was the ultimate destination of the MIO. "
800,5," Those paragraphs of the TAC do not appear to support plaintiffs' argument with regard to U.S. export commerce. TAC PP 15 
and 16 allege that eMag USA purchased MIO as U.S. imports. TAC P 17 alleges that eMag USA purchased MIO in purely 
domestic commerce. TAC P 19 alleges that eMag Wales purchased MIO in purely domestic commerce. TAC P29 alleges that 
Delta purchased MIO directly as U.S imports. TAC P 30 alleges that Delta purchased MIO in purely domestic commerce. TAC P

820,3," In Exxon Mobil, the Supreme Court clarified that HN4[
] the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is only operative where a federal suit is 
initiated after state court proceedings have ended. 125 S. Ct. at 1526 (""In both [Rooker and Feldman], the losing party in state 
court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended . . . .""). Proceedings end for Rooker-Feldman purposes when 
the state courts finally resolve the issue that the federal court plaintiff seeks to relitigate in a federal forum, even if other issues 
remain pending at the state level. See Federacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico v. Junta de Relaciones del Trabajo de Puerto 
Rico, 410 F.3d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 2005) (""if the state court proceedings have finally resolved all the federal questions in the 
litigation, but state law or purely factual questions (whether great or small) remain to be litigated, then the state proceedings 
have 'ended' within the meaning of Rooker-Feldman on the federal questions at issue""). A state supreme court's interlocutory 
ruling will therefore trigger the Rooker-Feldman doctrine's applicability where such ruling constitutes the final determination of an 
issue. See id. at 28 (relying upon Exxon Mobil to conclude that Rooker-Feldman prohibited a federal district court from deciding 
an issue already finally resolved by an interlocutory ruling of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court because ""the state court 
proceedings had ended with regard to the sole federal issue""). "
821,," Here, state court proceedings ended for Rooker-Feldman purposes when the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied Mothershed's 
request that it issue a writ of mandamus halting the Oklahoma bar disciplinary proceedings against him. That May 2002 state 
court ruling finally resolved that the disciplinary proceedings complied with Rule 6.7's timing requirements and that Mothershed's 
due process rights therefore were not violated, which represent the same issues that Mothershed subsequently sought to 
relitigate in federal district court."
821,4," The district court's dismissal of the Oklahoma defendants was premised upon the absence of personal jurisdiction, not subject

526 U.S. 574, 587-88, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760, 119 S. Ct. 1563 (1999). Here, the subject matter jurisdiction inquiry involves a 
straightforward application of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, and we accordingly adhere to the Supreme Court's admonition by 
relying upon the lack of subject matter jurisdiction to dismiss the Oklahoma defendants. "

] While Daubert applies to valuation testimony, whether offered by people like Mr. Dohmeyer, certified public 
accountants, or economists, Frymire-Brinati v. KPMG Peat Marwick, 2 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1993), the Daubert factors are not to be 
rigidly applied in this or any other context. In some context, they may not be applicable at all or may have diminished utility as 
measures of reliability. Loeffel Steel Products v. Delta Brands, 372 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 2005 WL 1388076 at *6. Some courts

there is no authoritative text regarding the calculations of damages due to a machine that operates at a rate below its

and the measure of damages available under Illinois law - which the defendants concede controls this case - would have been a 
starting point. "
852,9," A similar kind of manipulation is found in the defendants' rendition of Frymire-Brinati v. KPMG Peat Marwick, 2 F.3d 183 (7th

improperly forbidden to testify that the plaintiff's expert, a certified public accountant, ""bungled"" his ""valuation of damages."" 
(Response at 16). ""Similarly,"" the defendants say, they proffer ""Mr. Dohmeyer, an economist, as its expert."" Id. Mr. Dohmeyer 
isn't an economist, and the two cases are not similar. In Brinati, the chairman of the real estate committee of the American "
853,," Institute of Certified Public Accountants, not the appraiser, testified that the plaintiff's CPA had ""bungled"" by using historical 
rather than projected future income in his cash flow analysis. 2 F.3d at 187. It was in an effort to ""move from theory to concrete 
valuation"" that the appraiser was to testify thereafter about the accuracy of property values in the financial statements."
853,10," Rule 703 provides: HN15[
] Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or 
made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in 
forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the 
opinion or inference to be admitted. Facts or data that are otherwise inadmissable shall not be disclosed to the jury by the 
proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate 
the expert's opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect. "
854,11," By way of example, the court in Dura Automotive said that a theoretical economist, who relied on the findings of an 
econometric study conducted by another economist, would not be allowed to testify if he lacked expertise in econometrics, and 
the study raised questions that only an econometrician could answer. 285 F.3d at 614. Even Judge Wood, who dissented, 
agreed with this example. Id. at 620. See also TK-7 Corp., 993 F.2d at 732 HN21[
] (the rationale of Rule 703 ""is certainly not satisfied in this case where the expert failed to demonstrate any basis for concluding that another individual's opinion on a 
subjective financial prediction was reliable, other than the fact that it was the opinion of someone he believed to be an expert 
who had a financial interest in making an accurate prediction.""). "
856,12, Barbouti was cited approvingly in Dura Automotive. 285 F.3d at 613. 
857,13," When asked at his deposition how, since he knew nothing about the customer base of Loeffel or the eight publicly traded 
companies, he could have concluded that Loeffel served the same customer market as the eight other service centers, Mr. 
Dohmeyer said: Oh they have to. I mean it's -- you're in that industry, you're competing. You can't help -- once you're in an industry, you 
can't help but compete with other people in your industry. (Dohmeyer Dep., at 124). "
858,14," HN23[
] In antitrust cases, proof of the relevant product and geographic market is absolutely essential. The relevant 
geographic market is generally defined as the area of effective competition, that is the area in which the product or its 
reasonably interchangeable substitutes are traded. A determination of the geographic market must entail an analysis of several 
factors including the location of competitors and price data. Id. Although this case presents different issues, for purposes of 
determining comparability, the analysis is much the same. "
859,15," The defendants have taken a somewhat inconsistent position on the question of Mr. Dohmeyer's expertise in the steel 
industry. First, they say that that expertise is ""inconsequential."" (Response at 9). Then, as an afterthought, they say that Mr. 
Dohmeyer ""perform[ed] thorough research on the steel industry."" Of course he did no such thing and saying it doesn't make it 
so. Finally, they say he consulted with the defendants' personnel, who have extensive experience in the steel industry. Id. There 
is nothing to support the claim that the defendants' employees are experts, and Mr. Dohmeyer never claimed that they imparted 
information beyond their labor-added theory. In any event, even if they had, that would not begin to satisfy the requirements of 
Rule 702 or 703."
859,16," In 2002, the actual sales for the eight companies ranged from $ 99 million to $ 2.296 billion. There was a similar range in gross 
profit margins ranging from a low of 6% to a high of 29.8% in 2002."
859,17," HN26[

present when his or her opinion is speculative or rests on an unsound basis. See American Bearing Co. v. Litton Industries, Inc.,

862,18," Rule 26(a)(2)(B) provides, in pertinent part: HN31[
] Except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court, this disclosure shall, with respect to a witness who is 
retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party 
regularly involve giving expert testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness. The 
report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor; the data or 
other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions; [and] any exhibits to be used as a summary of or 
support for the opinions;. . . . (Emphasis supplied)."
862,19," Mr. Wiersema's report referred to approximately 1800 pages of exhibits, detailing expenses Loeffel claims to have incurred as 
a result of the Line's malfunctioning and the damages from claimed losses of current and prospective customers."
862,20," To emphasize the extent of his experience as an expert witness, Mr. Dohmeyer's Declaration says that he has provided 
""expert witness testimony and analysis for over 15 years in hundreds of cases."" 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24730, [WL] at 2. "
863,21," The Rule requires the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the 
preceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the 
witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years."
863,22," Only a handful of the entries contain the designation ""trial"" or ""deposition."" Even as to those that did, it was impossible to tell 
anything about the engagement or Mr. Dohmeyer's testimony since the entry did not contain sufficient information to enable 
Loeffel to conduct an appropriate inquiry."
863,23," The only conceivable reference to the Dunham case in the curriculum vitae is the terse entry, ""Bankruptcy -- Valuation of an 
insurance agency,"" which was buried in the middle of the 116 entries. "
864,24," The defendants' Response calls Ms. Pratt a ""highly regarded economist,"" but does not identify the basis for the representation. 
(Response at 7). An internet search reveals that she writes on valuation of businesses. www.bvresources.com. Ms. Pratt is 
apparently in the same field as Mr. Dohmeyer. "
880,1," In this regard, Plaintiffs' somewhat premature motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of this Order indicates that a 
number of members of the Board of Directors of the Consortiums is comprised of bank members. (See Sheedy Deposition at 46-
47; Jonas Deposition at 44-45). Plaintiffs, however, have still failed to allege that the bank members knowingly, intentionally or 
actively participated in the setting of the interchange fees and, after many opportunities to amend and to plead sufficient facts, 
Plaintiffs have again apparently conducted no discovery to demonstrate such necessary facts nor have they pled the requisite 
facts to establish a claim against the Bank Defendants. In addition, Plaintiffs were admonished by this Court upon granting the 
Bank Defendants' first motion to dismiss that Plaintiffs must conduct a reasonable inquiry of the underlying factual and legal 
grounds supporting their claims before amending. See Order at 4. Because the first amended complaint represents the fifth 
attempt to allege sufficient facts to support claims against the Defendant Banks (including the three complaints filed in Reyn's on 
the same basic theories and two attempts in this matter), the Court, in its discretion, finds that amendment under these particular 
circumstances would be futile and grants the present motion without leave to amend. "
886,1," In their original complaint in this matter, Plaintiffs alleged that VISA and MASTERCARD set only the interchange fee, which 
then ""established"" the basis or floor for the merchant discount rates. (See Complaint, P21(a).) Plaintiffs lack standing to assert 
such claims because they have not suffered the requisite antitrust injury from the Consortiums' setting of the interchange rate. 
See, e.g., Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 539, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 
S. Ct. 897 (1983) (plaintiff failed to demonstrate requisite antitrust injury because it was ""neither a consumer nor a competitor in 
the market in which the trade was restrained.""); see also Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 113, 93 L. Ed. 
2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986) (""a private plaintiff must allege threatened loss or damage 'of the type the antitrust laws were 
designed to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.'"") (citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-
O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). This contention is the independent basis for much of MASTERCARD's current motion to dismiss. To the extent Plaintiffs' claims 
are premised upon the setting only of the interchange fee, MASTERCARD's argument is well-taken. However, the First 
Amended Complaint alleges that the Consortiums set, either directly or indirectly, the merchant discount rate, which, for the 
purpose of resolving the pending motions, is the more troubling of the allegations now before the Court. "
888,2," In this regard, without converting the current motion before the Court to a motion for summary judgment, the Court has 
reviewed the full evidentiary record presented by the parties in their motions for summary judgment. Although the motions for 
summary judgment filed by VISA and MASTERCARD, which are fully briefed and set for hearing on August 19, 2005, will not be 
necessary as the Court by this order will dismiss the case, the Court has substantively reviewed those motions and the evidence 
submitted in conjunction therein for purposes of resolving the current motions."
888,3," The failure of Plaintiffs to come forward with any evidence to the contrary also dictates that this Court grant the pending 
motions to dismiss without leave to amend. It is clear from the record before this Court that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate 
that they have standing to sue and have failed to garner evidence which would enable them to generate a sufficient basis for the 
Court to find standing should leave be granted. Because the first amended complaint represents the fifth attempt to allege 
sufficient claims (three complaints filed in Reyn's and two attempts in this matter), and because, after development of the factual 
record, Plaintiffs are still unable to marshal sufficient facts to confer standing, the Court finds in its discretion that amendment in 
this particular context would be futile and grants the present motions without leave to amend. "

897,1," All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. Section 17203 provides, 
in relevant part: โHN1[
] Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined 
in any court of competent jurisdiction.โ "
899,2," The third Cel-Tech ground is that the conduct threatens an incipient violation of the antitrust laws. We need not analyze this 
ground. The Independent Dealers freely admit that this is not an antitrust case under federal law or section 16720 et seq. (the 
Cartwright Act). "
900,3, Title 15 United States Code section 1 et seq. 
901,4," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides: HN5[
] โEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 
100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said 
punishments, in the discretion of the court.โ (15 U.S.C. ยง 2.) "
903,5," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: HN9[
] โEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every 
person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any "
904,," other person, $ 1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court.โ (15 U.S.C. ยง 1.) "
905,6," We find the Independent Dealers' recapitulation of the complaint perplexing for two reasons. As we have indicated, the 
complaint never states that Verizon started paying commissions to its own stores. If that were not confusing enough, the trial 
court's statement of decision indicated that the โcommission changes alleged involve Verizon and Verizon stores, notโ the 
Independent Dealers. It is unclear why the trial court made this assumption. "
906,*," Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article 
VI, section 6 of the California Constitution. "
914,1," HN4[
] It is well settled that validity and infringement are separate questions that must be answered independently of each 
other. See, e.g., Pandrol USA, LP v. Airboss Ry. Prods., Inc., 320 F.3d 1354, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (where the defendants ""did 
not waive the right to a trial on the issue of invalidity by failing to raise it in opposition to the cross-motion for summary judgment 
as to the issue of infringement""); Medtronic, Inc. v. Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., 721 F.2d 1563, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (clarifying 
that ""though an invalid claim cannot give rise to liability for infringement, whether it is infringed is an entirely separate question 
capable of determination without regard to its validity"")."
914,2," HN6[
] Even if materiality and intent have been adequately demonstrated, the district court must balance the equities to 
determine whether the patentee has committed inequitable conduct that warrants holding the patent unenforceable. Monsanto 
Co., 363 F.3d at 1239 (citing Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Promega Corp., 323 F.3d 1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). Furthermore, 
the ""defense of inequitable conduct is entirely equitable in nature, and [is] thus not an issue for a jury to decide."" PerSeptive 
Biosystems, Inc. v. Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., 225 F.3d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2000). A patentee, therefore, has no right to a jury 
trial respecting the factual element of culpable intent as part of the defense of inequitable conduct. Id. Thus, a disputed finding of "
915,," intent to mislead or to deceive is one for the judge to resolve, not the jury, albeit not on summary judgment if there is a genuine 
dispute. "
916,3," HN12[
] To establish an anti-trust violation under the Sherman Act, Defendant must show (i) a specific attempt by Plaintiff to 
monopolize the relevant market, and (ii) a dangerous probability that the attempt would be successful in achieving a monopoly in 
the relevant market. See Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd., 781 F.2d 861, 875 (Fed. Cir. 1985). "
917,4," 35 U.S.C. ยง 287(a) provides, in pertinent part: HN15[
] Patentees, and persons making, offering for sale, or selling within the United States any patented article for or 
under them, or importing any patented article into the United States, may give notice to the public that the same is 
patented, either by fixing thereon the word ""patent"" or the abbreviation ""pat."", together with the number of the patent, or 
when, from the character of the article, this can not be done, by fixing to it, or to the package wherein one or more of them 
is contained, a label containing a like notice. In the event of failure so to mark, no damages shall be recovered by the 
patentee in any action for infringement, except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to 
infringe thereafter, in which event damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice. Filing of an 
action for infringement shall constitute such notice."
917,5," Plaintiff states that since the individual tablets are far too small to display such a notice, Plaintiff ""properly marked the container 
in which the tablets are shipped to its customers in accordance with 35 U.S.C. ยง 287(a)."" Pl.'s Br. Supp. Summ. J. at p. 19. "
928,1," The Japanese courts' rationale for finding in favor of Delica was (1) while Japanese law protects a person's full name from 
exploitation, McBee's full name, including his middle name, was ""Cecil Leroy McBee,"" and thus the ""Cecil McBee"" line of "
929,," products was not an exact copy of McBee's full name; and (2) McBee received no protection for the abbreviated version of his 
name, ""Cecil McBee,"" because the name had not received sufficient recognition in general Japanese society."
929,2," McBee's expert, Joseph McNulty, testified that Delica's use of the name ""Cecil McBee"" on its Internet website could decrease 
McBee's ability to receive compensation for lending his name to another company's brand. However, as McBee's own brief 
points out, McBee has never shown any interest in this kind of product marketing. "
930,3," Delica's laches claim was rejected in a separate, earlier recommended decision of the magistrate judge, see  McBee v. Delica 
Co., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20132, No. 02-198-P-C, 2003 WL 22586387 (D. Me. Nov. 10, 2003) (unpublished), which was 
adopted by the district court. "
931,4," The magistrate judge recommended that Delica's motion for summary judgment on the remaining Lanham Act damages claims 
and on the various pendent state law claims be denied. See  McBee, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23415, 2004 WL 2634465, at *5-
*15. "
932,5," The Lanham Act was substantially amended in 1988, see Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-667, 102 
Stat. 3935, and was amended again in 1999, see Trademark Amendments Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-43, 113 Stat. 218, 
but the key jurisdictional language of the Lanham Act has remained unchanged since Steele."
932,6," The Court in a more recent case held that Title VII could not be applied extraterritorially at all, even to domestic employees 
working for domestic employers overseas. See  Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. at 250-54. The Court held that Title VII's 
jurisdictional language, in contrast to the language of the Lanham Act, did not evince a Congressional intent to apply Title VII 
abroad sufficient to overcome the presumption against such extraterritorial application. See id. "
933,7," The nationality basis for extraterritorial jurisdiction is also explicit in certain statutes. For example, both the treason statute, see 
18 U.S.C. ยง 1381, and the selective service statute, see 50 U.S.C. App. ยง 453, apply to all American citizens regardless of 
whether they might be located abroad. "
934,8," This effects test had its origins in  United States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945), although it took a 
considerable period of time to gain widespread acceptance. See generally 1 W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust 
Laws ยง 2.10 (5th ed. 1996). An older and now discredited view, reflected in  American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 
347, 356, 53 L. Ed. 826, 29 S. Ct. 511 (1909), was that antitrust laws were wholly territorial in nature. Notably, Steele cited 
American Banana and rejected a territorial interpretation of that case; it read American Banana as applying only when there 
were no effects in the United States from the foreign antitrust violation. See  Steele, 344 U.S. at 288. In 1982, Congress passed the FTAIA, which provided that the Sherman Act ""shall not apply to conduct involving trade or 
commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless . . . such conduct has a direct, substantial, 
and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on United States commerce. 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a; see 1 Fugate, supra, ยง 2.14. The Supreme 
Court has never explained the relationship between the FTAIA and the older, judicially-created effects test; thus it remains 
unclear the extent to which the FTAIA is a codification of that test and the extent to which the FTAIA amends it. See  Hartford 
Fire, 509 U.S. at 796 n.23; see also  Nippon Paper, 109 F.3d at 4."
934,9," The traditional extraterritorial test for jurisdiction in the antitrust area has often, including in Hartford Fire, been articulated as 
containing a requirement that the defendant intend to cause the substantial effects on United States commerce that actually 
have been created.  509 U.S. at 796. The FTAIA's ""reasonably foreseeable"" requirement appears to be related to this traditional 
intent requirement. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a. We need not and do not decide whether a defendant's intent to target United States 
commerce plays any role in the jurisdictional inquiry for purposes of extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act -- either, for 
example, as a requirement in addition to the substantial effect requirement, or instead as a factor that, if present, may reduce the 
amount of effects on United States commerce that a plaintiff must show. It is evident that Delica, in this case, had no intent to 
target United States commerce. We do note that lack of intent can sometimes change the scope of remedies under the Lanham Act. For example, an innocent 
infringer can generally only be subject to an injunction against future use. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 1114(2). This, of course, is not a 
jurisdictional matter. "
935,10," Some courts have criticized Vanity Fair's ""substantial effects"" inquiry as having been taken out of context, and have replaced it 
with a much less demanding ""some effect"" inquiry. These courts state that the ""substantial effects"" test was not clearly 
embraced in Steele and stems from attempts to determine when local commerce has a sufficient effect on interstate commerce 
to be congressionally reachable, which has no relevance to the question of determining when wholly foreign commerce can be 
reached. See  Am. Rice, 701 F.2d at 414 n.8;  Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., 556 F.2d 406, 428 (9th Cir. 
1977). American Rice involved domestic defendants, although the court did not restrict the modification of its test to such 
situations. The Supreme Court has embraced the ""substantial effects"" test for extraterritorial application of the antitrust laws, and 
Congress, in the FTAIA, has either codified that understanding or established an even more restrictive test. We see no reason to 
treat the Lanham Act differently."
935,11," As we noted above, the subject matter jurisdiction issue was determined on a summary judgment record, after extensive 
discovery; McBee did not file a Rule 56(f) affidavit below stating that he needed more discovery. We note also that in this 
context, the jurisdictional inquiry will generally not be wholly distinct from the merits. See 1A Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 
273a. "
936,12," We do not reach the more complicated question of whether comity concerns would ever allow a court to decline to exercise 
jurisdiction when an injunction is sought against sales in the United States."
936,13," Preliminarily, Delica disputes whether it is technologically possible to prevent access by American consumers while 
simultaneously allowing access to the website in the rest of the world. We lack the information to resolve this dispute, and at any 
rate we need not resolve it in order to decide this dispute. "
937,14," The cases cited by McBee involve such situations and are therefore easily distinguishable; as well, they contain no analysis at 
all of the question McBee has raised. See  Euromarket Designs, Inc. v. Crate & Barrel Ltd., 96 F. Supp. 2d 824, 831-33 (N.D. Ill. 
2000);  Playboy Enters. v. Chuckleberry Publ'g, Inc., 939 F. Supp. 1032, 1039-40 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). "
939,15," Were we to reach comity principles, they would most likely counsel for dismissal of McBee's claim seeking damages for 
Delica's sales in Japan. McBee argues that so long as he seeks only damages and not an injunction, there is no ""true conflict"" 
with Japanese law because it would be theoretically possible for Delica to comply with both Japanese and United States law. 
See  Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 798-99. McBee's argument makes no sense: an injunction would no more create a ""true conflict"" 
under this definition than damages, for under either form of relief it would be theoretically possible for Delica to comply with both 
nations' laws by not using the trademark. There is no meaningful distinction between an injunction and damages for this 
purpose. The reasoning developed in the antitrust context in Hartford Fire is not ""automatically transferable"" to the trademark 
context: ""It is one thing for the British reinsurers in Hartford Fire to be barred under United States law from boycotting activity that 
they might be free to engage in without violating British law. But it is quite a different thing for the holder of rights in a mark under 
German law to be ordered to refrain from uses of that mark protected by German law.""  Sterling Drug, 14 F.3d at 746-47."
939,16," It is true that HN20[
] we lack subject matter jurisdiction over claims that involve no real federal controversy because they 
""clearly appear[] to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly 
insubstantial and frivolous.""  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 89-90, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 
(1998). This test goes to whether, legally, there is any real federal interest involved in the case. The fatal flaw in McBee's claim 
here, as we explain below, is that the only sales made to the United States were sales instigated at his own behest. This sort of 
factual weakness in a claim does not go to subject matter jurisdiction. "
940,17," Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760, 119 S. Ct. 1563 (1999), is not to the contrary. Although 
Ruhrgas contained language on the importance of personal jurisdiction, the decision merely established that a court can, in 
some circumstances, dispose of a case on a different threshold ground before reaching subject matter jurisdiction. See  id. at 
584-85; see also  Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 161 L. Ed. 2d 82, 125 S. Ct. 1230, 1234 n.4 (2005). The thrust of Ruhrgas was to 
increase judicial flexibility, not to decrease it. See  Ruhrgas AG, 526 U.S. at 587-88. "

(Claim No. 15232), and Enron Energy Services, Inc (Claim No. 15233) based on their alleged manipulation of the natural gas

Power Marketing Inc. (Claim No. 15230), Enron Energy Services, LLC (Claim No. 15234) and Enron Energy Services North

952,3," The Debtors responded to the relief sought by OPL as if it included a request for leave to file late proofs of claim. However, 
since OPL neither briefed nor argued such a request, the Court only addresses the relief sought as a request to amend OPL's 
timely-filed original Claims."

973,*," Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation."
973,1," Posturing this action as one brought by W & S against the State is a harmless oversimplification. In fact, W & S's principal, 
John Haronian, is also a plaintiff and Jeffrey J. Greer, in his official capacity as associate director of Rhode Island's Department 
of Business Regulation, is also a defendant. Because their presence is essentially superfluous, we opt for simplicity and proceed 
as if W & S and the State were the only parties. "
976,2," There is no suggestion here that any of W & S's franchisees plan to terminate the franchise relationships for reasons unrelated 
to the threatened enforcement of the new statutory provisions. Therefore, this is not a case in which ""the injury complained of is 
'the result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.'"" Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (alterations and 
emphasis in original) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992)). "
978,3," HN17[
] A case like this one, in which the statute imposes no burden on the communication between the speaker and the 
intended audience but has the effect of decreasing the audience's demand for a particular kind of business advice, is 
distinguishable from cases dealing with the State's direct imposition of financial burdens on the dissemination of particular kinds 
of speech. See, e.g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115-18, 123, 116 L. Ed. 
2d 476, 112 S. Ct. 501 (1991) (invalidating law requiring publisher to place convicted criminals' income derived from publications 
about their crimes into escrow for victim compensation); Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. Comm'r of Rev., 460 U.S. 575, 
581-83, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295, 103 S. Ct. 1365 (1983) (finding that tax on paper and ink products consumed in newspaper production 
imposed an unconstitutional burden on freedom of the press). In such cases, the government, not waning market demand, was 
directly responsible for the financial disincentive to speak. "
981,4," In pertinent part, HN28[
] that amendment prohibits ""the transportation or importation . . . for delivery or use . . . of intoxicating 
liquors [into any state]"" in violation of state law. U.S. Const. amend. XXI, ยง 2. "
982,5," The conclusion that otherwise valid regulation of commercial interactions between business entities does not offend the First 
Amendment merely because such interactions have a communicative component would apply with equal force to our analysis in 
Part V(A)(1), had we found that the relevant sub-paragraphs of section 3-5-11(b)(1) did in fact impede communications between 
W & S and the holders of Class A liquor licenses. "
983,6," To be sure, W & S contends that the challenged statutes burden its fundamental rights of speech and association. We dismiss 
that contention out of hand. See supra Part V (establishing that the challenged statutes do not impermissibly impinge upon W & 
S's First Amendment rights)."
983,7," Even in the improbable event that the two markets were to be deemed substantially similar, that showing alone would not 
ensure W & S's success. Regulation must start somewhere. See FCC v. Beach Communications, 508 U.S. 307, 316, 124 L. Ed. 
2d 211, 113 S. Ct. 2096 (1993) (explaining that ""the legislature must be allowed leeway to approach a perceived problem 
incrementally""). "
988,1," This opinion uses ""C."" and ""N.J."" to identify documents respectively submitted by Caremark and North Jackson. "
992,2," North Jackson's other principal argument in favor of per se treatment is that Caremark has ""immense market power"" and that 
its activities should therefore be judged under the per se rule. That argument has no merit. HN8[
] While it is clear that "
993,," ""substantial market power is an indispensable ingredient of every claim under the Rule of Reason"" (Digital Equip. Corp. v. Uniq 
Digital Tech., Inc., 73 F.3d 756, 761 (7th Cir. 1996)), there appears to be no authority (and indeed none is found in the cases 
North Jackson cites) to support the notion that substantial market power is a sufficient, rather than a necessary, basis for finding 
that a given restraint is per se unlawful under Section 1."
993,3," It is true that the SAC alleges that consumers will ultimately be harmed by the alleged conspiracy, as ""PBMs will bankrupt 
[independent] pharmacies, thereby capturing a larger segment of the insurance-paid prescription market for the PBMs' own 
prescription-dispensing business, [which will] allow[] the PBMs to charge higher prices for that service"" (Express Scripts, 345 
F.Supp.2d at 1292). Whether that is so, however, is a question better answered by a full rule of reason inquiry. What controls for 
present purposes is that the immediate and assured consequence of the alleged agreement appears to be lower prices for the 
consumers of insurance-reimbursed prescription drugs."
993,4," For purposes of the current analysis. North Jackson's Claim II--that other aspects of Caremark's activities in conjunction with 
other PBMs assertedly restrict competition--is not implicated in the claim now under review. "
994,5," Whether (as appears likely) this opinion proves to be the last major assignment of this Court's soon-to-depart law clerk Alex 
Pearce, it well exemplifies his outstanding work throughout his clerkship year. That high quality has marked all of Alex's tenure, 
whether in the production of draft opinions or in the performance of all the other duties that devolve upon this Court's clerks in 
what is akin to a three-lawyer law firm. As always it should be made clear, however, that any errors that may have found their 
way into the final opinions signed by this Court are its responsibility rather than that of its fine clerk, for every such work product 
has been the result of this Court's word by word and sentence by sentence vetting and recasting of the clerk's original draft. "
1001,1," Given this Court's conclusion that PM's WL program violates neither the Robinson-Patman Act nor the Sherman Act, the 
preliminary injunction was improvidently granted. "
1002,2," Simply put, this means a difference in price."
1002,3," The Court notes that such is the essence of a competitive economic system. Businesses that wish to succeed and gain market 
advantage over their competitors must make such choices everyday. Some flourish, some fail, but such is the nature of 
competition. "
1007,4," Since the Master Settlement Agreement of 1998, dozens of new cigarette manufacturers have entered the market and have 
captured approximately 15% of the market despite an overall significant decline in U.S. cigarette sales over the last 20 years. "
1012,1," In his written submissions as well as at oral argument on the motion, Plaintiff asserts that the TRB Rules effectively create a 
private Patent and Trademark Office and grant a ""language monopoly"" or a ""monopoly of words from the dictionary."" (Opp. Br. at 
7; FAC, P 85.) The MPAA's private arrangement to prioritize the use of motion picture titles, as Plaintiff concedes in his 
complaint, is designed ""to avoid confusion in the marketplace between competing projects with identical or similar marks."" (FAC, 
P 84.) Such private arrangement serves its members by prioritizing the right to use a certain title among its members;  [*10] it 
does not constitute a private PTO and such prioritizing does not constitute a monopoly in the relevant market. There is no 
relevant market made up of words, or titles, and the relevant market designated by Plaintiff -- the United States motion picture 
production and distribution -- is not affected by the restrictions imposed by the TRB Rules, as discussed above. "
1013,2," In addition, Plaintiff has not alleged in his complaint that he attempted to register his title with the TRB and only represented at 
oral argument that his attempt to register was frustrated by his own refusal to abide by the terms required for registration. 
Without having tried to benefit from the TRB's registration process, Plaintiff cannot contend that he has suffered from rejection of 
the registration of his own title. "
1019,1," Defendant Douglas M. Schlechte does not join in the counterclaims. Nevertheless, for ease of reference, the court refers to the 
counterclaims throughout as ""defendants' counterclaims."""
1019,2," The counterdefendants characterize themselves as ""third-party defendants."" However, no third-party claim has been asserted 
against them because defendants do not allege that they are liable ""to [defendants] for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against 
the [defendants]."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 14 (a) . Rather, HN1[
] parties joined by a defendant to answer a counterclaim along with a 
party plaintiff are referred to as ""counterdefendants."" See, ironically, Independence Tube Corp. v. Copperweld Corp., 74 F.R.D. 
462, 468 (N.D. 111. 1977)."
1019,3, The complaint also alleges that David W. Schlechte personally guaranteed the debt. 
1021,4," Defendants do not dispute that their claim for violations of Missouri antitrust law is governed by federal antitrust law. (See 
Mem. Opp'n at 10.)"
1021,5," Elsewhere, defendants allege that certain of the offending terms had been in effect since as early as 1998 as part of a 
conspiracy between WLC and its authorized sales representatives. (See, e.g., 1st Am. Countercl. PP 39-42.) Because 1998 is 
even earlier than 1999, those allegations do not impact the court's statute of limitations analysis."
1021,6," Thus, HN12[
] federal courts have distinguished ""uncertain damages"" from ""uncertain extent of damages."" Pace Indus., Inc. v. Three Phoenix Co., 813 F.2d 234, 240 (9th Cir. 1987)(citing In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 591 F.2d 68, 73 (9th Cir. 
1979)). The former constitutes a plaintiff's inability to establish an injury and, thus, a cause of action. See id. at 240. The latter 
constitutes mere imprecision in the calculation of damages, which may be settled by the jury's reasonable estimation. See id. at 
240. "
1035,1," HN1[
] The HCQIA expressly excludes federal civil rights claims from its immunity provisions. 42 U.S.C. ยง 11111 (a) (1)."
1035,2," To overcome Defendants' immunity defense and to prove their federal discrimination claims, Plaintiffs contend that they need to 
review peer review materials. Defendants take the position that those materials are protected by the Georgia peer review 
privilege and are not subject to discovery. The ARMC Defendants, who have custody and control of the peer review materials, 
have filed a Motion for Protective Order, and therefore, those materials have not been produced to Plaintiffs. In light of the 
Court's grant of summary judgment to the ARMC Defendants and the fact that the Athens Vascular Defendants do not seek 
summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' federal discrimination claims, a question exists as to whether the peer review privilege issue, 
which had been presented by the ARMC Defendants in their motion for a protective order, is now necessary to resolve. The 
Court, as explained in further detail in this Order, finds that the issue must be decided since it is relevant to the Athens Vascular 
Defendants' summary judgment motion based upon HCQIA immunity and because those peer review materials are relevant to 
Plaintiffs' federal discrimination claims against the Athens Vascular Defendants, for which no summary judgment motion has 
been filed. "
1036,3," It appears that until April 30, 2004, when all of his staff privileges lapsed, Dr. Adeduntan maintained all privileges except for 
permission to perform AAA surgeries."
1036,4," The first charge of discrimination alleged that Dr. Adeduntan was subjected to peer review, had limited hospital privileges, and 
faced future loss of his hospital privileges because of his race and national origin. His second charge stated that he was subject 
to retaliation for filing the first charge."
1036,5," The ARMC Defendants state that Dr. Adeduntan's privileges lapsed because his application to renew them was incomplete in 
three ways: (1) he did not provide an appropriate written opinion from Dr. Vittimberga in accordance with the PRRA (discussed 
in more detail infra); (2) the reference from St. Mary's Hospital was not timely received; and (3) the reference from Elberton 
Hospital was never received. "
1038,6, Punctuation and capitalization as in original. 
1039,7," Plaintiffs' logic is inconsistent with the law in that they seem to argue that because the direct observation requirement was 
ambiguous as to whether it was prospective or retrospective in nature, they have satisfied the requirement by fulfilling it 
according to their interpretation. HN10[
] Under Georgia law, if an ambiguity exists in an agreement, the court should attempt 
to resolve the ambiguity by applying the statutory rules of contract construction. Atlanta Dev., Inc. v. Emerald Capital, 258 Ga. 
App. 472, 476, 574 S.E.2d 585, 589 (2002). If the ambiguity cannot be negated by applying the rules of construction, then parol 
evidence may be introduced, and the issue of what was intended by the parties is a matter for a jury to decide. Livoti, 263 Ga. 
App. at 903, 590 S.E.2d at 164. Simply establishing that an ambiguity exists does not mean that Plaintiffs' interpretation must 
prevail. "
1040,8," In light of this ruling, it is unnecessary to address the ARMC Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Dr. 
Adeduntan's Title VII claim based upon their contention that they were not his employer."
1040,9," The only remaining antitrust claims are those asserted against the Athens Vascular Defendants. The release in the PRRA bars 
Plaintiffs' antitrust claims against the ARMC Defendants. The Court notes that Defendant Hospital Authority of Athens-Clarke 
County is not in any event subject to Plaintiffs' antitrust claims as an instrumentality, agency, or political subdivision of Athens-
Clarke County, which Plaintiffs concede in their Complaint. (Compl. at PP 64, 69.) Even if the PRRA did not operate to bar 
Plaintiffs' antitrust claims against the ARMC Defendants, they would still be entitled to summary judgment for the reasons stated 
herein. "
1041,10," The Athens Vascular Defendants also provide numerous citations to cases outside the Eleventh Circuit that have similarly 
found that denial of a doctor's hospital privileges does not satisfy the requirement of antitrust injury. See, e.g., Patel v. Midland 
Mem'l Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 298 F.3d 333, 346 (5th Cir. 2002) (finding suspension of privileges at one hospital did not eliminate 
plaintiff as competitor when he continued to treat patients at another facility); BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Mem'l 
Area Hosp. Ass'n, 36 F.3d 664, 667, 668-69 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding anesthetists failed to show impact on competition, rather 
than themselves and also collecting federal cases that have reached same conclusion on antitrust claims); Austin v. McNamara, 
979 F.2d 728, 739 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting that ""[e]ven the elimination of a single competitor, standing alone, does not prove 
anticompetitive effect. . . . [I]njury to competition, beyond the impact on the claimant'"" is required). "
1042,11," Plaintiffs note that St. Mary's Hospital, where Dr. Adeduntan also maintains privileges, lacks open heart and dedicated 
angioplasty facilities. Although these are not facilities needed for Dr. Adeduntan to perform his surgeries, Plaintiffs submit that 
they may be needed for some of his patients, who often suffer from heart-related problems. Plaintiffs contend that the limited 
facilities at St. Mary's therefore impact Dr. Adeduntan's ability to treat patients there because patients may require a transfer 
from St. Mary's to ARMC, resulting in financial impact on those patients. However, the Court finds that this connection between 
vascular surgery and cardiac procedures is still insufficient to establish antitrust injury to the competition for vascular surgery in 
the Athens-Clarke area."
1042,12," HN22[
] The statute excludes civil rights actions brought under state or federal law. 42 U.S.C. ยง 11111(a)(1). Accordingly, the immunity sought would apply to Plaintiffs' antitrust claims-which the Court has already disposed of on other grounds-and 
their state law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. "
1043,13," As noted previously, the ARMC Defendants have refused to produce any peer review materials based upon their contention 
that such materials are not discoverable because of the Georgia peer review privilege. "
1044,14," Other circuits have rejected the application of the peer review privilege in federal question or civil rights cases, despite the 
widespread adoption of such statutory privileges throughout the United States. See Virmani v. Novant Health, Inc., 259 F.3d 
284, 293 (4th Cir. 2001); Mem'l Hosp. v. Shadur, 664 F.2d 1058, 1063 (7th Cir. 1981) (per curiam)."
1044,15," Furthermore, the Court notes that Congress, in enacting the HCQIA and providing immunity from civil damages to individuals 
who participate in medical peer review proceedings, specifically excluded immunity from suits brought for violations of civil rights. 
42 U.S.C. ยง 11111(a)(1). HN33[
] While the HCQIA is certainly intended to promote the peer review process, it does not, by its 
terms, completely bar confidential peer review information from disclosure, particularly in cases where the peer review process 
itself is at issue. "
1045,16," See also Donald P. Vandergrift, Jr., The Privilege of Self-Critical Analysis: A Survey of the Law 60 Alb. L. Rev. 171, 180-81 
(1996)."
1045,17," The Court observes that although it has granted summary judgment to the ARMC Defendants as to all of Plaintiffs' claims, it 
retains the authority to order the ARMC Defendants to produce the documents pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, as the Court has not entered final judgment as to those parties."
1045,18," In light of this ruling, the Court anticipates that the remaining parties may need to amend the scheduling/discovery order for 
the limited purpose of addressing the scheduling of the additional limited discovery permitted by this Order. The parties are 
ordered to confer and provide the Court with a proposed amended scheduling order within thirty days of the date of this Order. "
1055,1," The thirteen Hospital Plaintiffs in Case No. 05-20591 are: Bert Fish Medical Center, Inc.; Cape Memorial Hospital, Inc.; Halifax 
Hospital Medical Center; Hendry County Hospital Authority; Holmes County Hospital Corporation; Jackson County Hospital 
District; Lee Memorial Health System; North Brevard County Hospital District; North Broward Hospital District; Public Health 
Trust of Miami-Dade County, Florida, Sarasota County Public Hospital District; South Broward Hospital District; and West 
Orange Healthcare District."
1055,2," The term ""Plaintiffs"" will be used throughout this Order to refer to all three Plaintiff groups -- Boca, the Hospital Plaintiffs, and 
the Florida AG -- collectively. "
1056,3," Specifically, HN2[
] the outlier provision permits hospitals to ""request additional payments in any case where charges, adjusted to cost,"" exceed an amount that the Secretary of HHS specifies. Id.; 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(ii). According to 
CMS, ""this additional payment is designed to protect the hospital from large financial losses due to unusually expensive cases."" 
Id., 68 Fed. Reg. 10420, 10421 (Mar. 5, 2004). The outlier payment is meant to ""approximate the marginal cost of care."" Id.; 42 
U.S.C. ยง 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(iii). "
1057,4," For example, if a hospital's CCR is 0.5 and its charges for a patient total $ 10,000, then its costs to treat that patient would be 
roughly $ 5,000. Id."
1057,5," The calculation is represented by the following equation: Outlier payment = 80% x [(charges x CCR) -- IPPS Payment -- Outlier 
Threshold]. Boca Compl. P 33; Pub. Hosp. Compl. P 48. "
1058,6," CMS assigns the SWA to a hospital when its CCR falls below the national threshold because CMS presumes that a CCR below 
this level is unreasonable and probably due to a faulty data reporting or entry. Boca Compl. P 55; Pub. Hosp. Compl. P 39."
1058,7," Boca voluntarily dismissed its fraud-based causes of action, set forth in Counts III, IV, and VI of its Complaint. "
1060,8," The Florida RICO law was patterned after its federal counterpart. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1263-64 (quoting Jones v. 
Childers, 18 F.3d 899, 901 (11th Cir. 1994) (noting that ""interpretation of Florida's RICO law is informed by case law interpreting 
the federal RICO statute . . . on which Chapter 772 is patterned.'"")). The Court therefore applies the same analysis to Plaintiff's 
federal and state RICO claims. Id.; see also All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., Inc., 135 F.3d 740, 745 
(11th Cir. 1998) (""Florida's RICO statutes have consistently been interpreted using federal RICO claim cases."")."
1060,9," Tenet bases its standing argument on the following characterization of Plaintiffs' alleged causal chain: Increasing gross charges gave some Tenet hospitals low CCRs; CMS's fiscal intermediary assigned all hospitals with low 
CCRs (including some Tenet hospitals) the SWA; using the SWA gave some hospitals (including some Tenet hospitals) 
higher outlier payments from CMS; higher outlier payments by CMS to these hospitals (only some of which were Tenet 
hospitals) increased the volume of outlier payments made nationwide; CMS increased the outlier threshold in order to 
decrease outlier payments nationwide; and this increase by CMS in the outlier threshold potentially deprived plaintiffs of a 
fraction of outlier payments they might have qualified for had CMS not raised the outlier threshold. Def.'s Mem. at 16. "
1062,10," As Plaintiffs' counsel identified at the oral argument, the damages that the Government may choose to seek from Tenet are 
different that those that Plaintiffs claim in these actions. Indeed, ""the government would be seeking to recover its shortfall and 
[the Plaintiffs] would be seeking to recover damages as a result of the increased threshold; the increased deductible."" See Tr. of 
June 20, 2005, Oral Argument (""Tr.""), DE-62 at 26. "
1063,11," In Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
1064,12," In so ruling, the Court is not concluding that allegations exist to support a finding of ""fraud or trickery."" Indeed, Plaintiffs have 
dismissed their fraud claims, and have agreed to eliminate references to alleged fraud from the Complaints. However, given the 
allegations, there is support for a finding that CMS did not ""consent"" to the alleged scheme because Tenet's excessive outlier 
reimbursements were based on intentionally inaccurate charge submissions to CMS that did not reasonably reflect costs. "
1065,13," The intracorporate conspiracy doctrine holds that acts of corporate agents are attributed to the corporation itself, thereby 
negating the multiplicity of actors necessary for the formation of a conspiracy."" Kirwin v. Price Commc' ns Corp., 391 F.3d 1323, 
1326 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing McAndrew v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 206 F.3d 1031, 1035 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc)). When 
applicable, the doctrine precludes a finding of conspiracy because ""a corporation cannot conspire with its employees, and its 
employees, when acting in the scope of their employment, cannot conspire among themselves."" Id.; see also Copperweld Corp. 
v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) (holding, in the antitrust context, that 
""officers or employees of the same firm do not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a [Sherman Antitrust Act] ยง 1 
conspiracy.""). "
1066,14," The Eleventh Circuit has recognized the significant overlap between the standing and proximate cause issues. Williams, 411 
F.3d at 1261, n.4. Notwithstanding the interconnectedness of the two concepts, the Court reviews the proximate cause issue as 
a separate, distinct element of a RICO claim."
1066,15," Tenet's argument regarding the presence of intervening players and acts, addressed in the standing section of this Order, also 
merits discussion here. As a general matter, the ""presence of intervening factors breaks the causal chain between predicate acts 
and injury, thereby precluding a proximate cause finding."" Andrews v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 673, 689 (W.D. 
Tex. 2001). However, at this stage of the litigation, the degree of involvement by each alleged actor in the causal chain is 
unknown, and Tenet has simply failed to demonstrate that it should be absolved of all liability merely because some other actors 
may have impacted on Plaintiffs' injuries. "
1069,16," In a footnote, Tenet also argues that the FDUTPA claim must be dismissed to the extent that the Florida AG seeks recovery 
for conduct prior to July 1, 2001. See Def.'s Mem. at n. 16. However, Tenet has not demonstrated that these pre-2001 claims are 
subject to dismissal at this time."
1069,17," Tenet's reliance on Norwest Mortgage, Inc. v. Superior Court, 72 Cal. App. 4th 214, 225-26, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 18 (Cal. Ct. App. 
1999) is misplaced. Tenet relies on Norwest for its assertion that Boca's UCL claim must be dismissed. However, in Norwest, the 
Court specifically held that it was dismissing the UCL claim because the facts demonstrated that the non-Californians were 
injured by conduct occurring outside of California's borders, by defendants whose headquarters and principal places of operation 
are outside of California. Id. Here, as noted above, Boca has specifically alleged conduct taking place in California, and Tenet's 
executive headquarters are in Santa Barbara, California. "
1070,18, Boca is not proceeding on the theory that Tenet's practices were fraudulent. See Pls.' Mem. at n. 26. 
1083,1," Tennessee Code Annotated section 47-25-101 (2001) provides that HN6[

view to lessen, or which tend to lessen, full and free competition in the importation or sale of articles imported into this state,

agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations designed, or which tend, to advance, reduce, or 
control the price or the cost to the producer or the consumer of any such product or article, are declared to be against 
public policy, unlawful, and void. Tennessee Code Annotated 47-25-102 prohibits agreements HN7[

manufactured in this state, or imported into this state, to any producer or consumer at prices reduced below the cost of 
production or importation into this state."" The statute further prohibits ""any other arrangements, contracts, or agreements, by and 
between its agents and subagents, which tend to lessen full and free competition in the sale of all such articles manufactured 
and imported into the state, and which amount to a subterfuge for the purpose of obtaining the same advantage and purposes."" "
1084,2," The defendants contend that permitting Freeman to recover the full consideration that it paid to the direct purchaser for the food 
products violates the constitutional principles of fairness and due process. Because we interpret Tennessee Code Annotated 
section 47-25-106 as permitting Freeman to recover only the amount of the overcharge that the direct purchaser passed on to 
Freeman, we need not reach this issue."

1094,1,"  HN4[
] Because a Walker Process claim is aimed at removing patent law immunity from antitrust claims, the level of 
enforcement required for a Walker Process claim is an issue associated with patent law and Federal Circuit law rather than 
Fifth Circuit law governs whether a patentholderhas taken adequate steps to enforce the patent. See Unitherm Food Sys. v. 
Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 375 F.3d 1341, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (""which actions can cause a patentee . . . to lose the general 
protection of the patent law and to risk liability for [antitrust] damages is clearly an issue unique to the patent law -- and 
therefore inappropriate for resolution under the potentially varying interpretations of the regional circuits"")."
1094,2,  
1095,," The letter, attached as Exhibit 9 to the Second Amended Complaint, states that Grant Prideco believes the 631 Patent 
""maybe relevant to"" pending orders for certain drill pipe and does not mention Hydril. See Letter to OMSCO, Exh. 9 to 
Second Amended Complaint. "
1108,1, The following facts from the Complaint are assumed true for purposes of this motion only.
1108,2," MGA describes the Bratz as ""multi-ethnic fashion dolls that sport a fresh new urban and contemporary look and fashion."" 
Compl. P 8. "
1109,3," In particular, MGA alleges: Mattel has . . . warned a number of companies, including the biggest publishing entity in the United Kingdom, not to license 
MGA products, or risk retribution. The threats are not idle. In May 2004, Mattel terminated one of its licensees, apparently in 
retribution for licensing ""Bratz."" While some companies have been courageous enough to take the risk, others have not, 
and MGA has lost valuable licensing opportunities as a result. Compl. P 76. "
1112,4," For the same reason, the court denies Mattel's motion to strike paragraph 35 of the Complaint, which provides relevant 
background information regarding the purpose of Mattel's release of the My Scene dolls and its release of the ""Flavas."" See 
Compl. PP 35-36 (""[Mattel's My Scene dolls,] [the] confusingly similar Bratz imitators [,] may have been originally intended to buy 
Mattel time while it worked to release another product the following summer, called Flavas.' . . . The [Flavas] were not well-
received. . . . Mattel has seemingly abandoned this line. Realizing that My Scene' was its best bet for riding MGA's successful 
coattails and capitalizing on the unique and inherently distinctive look that MGA had developed in its Bratz' dolls -- and MGA's 
substantial goodwill -- Mattel has systematically proceeded to modify the My Scene' dolls since their original release, particularly 
their eyes, to increase their similarity to Bratz' more and more over time.""). "
1113,5," This same reasoning applies to defeat MGA's arguments that the third section of the Complaint supports MGA's claims for 
attorneys' fees, injunctive relief, and ""unfair competition"" under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a). The relevant ""intent"" raised 
by each of these claims is the same as that raised by MGA's trade dress claims. "
1115,6," Mattel attempts to avoid this result by relying upon Cel-Tech's statement that HN8[
] ""the antitrust laws were enacted for the 
protection of competition, not competitors."" Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th at 186 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 115, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986)). Although true, this 
statement does not aid Mattel because MGA's UCL claim does seek to protect ""competition,"" not just ""competitors."" The 
essence of MGA's claim is that Mattel has engaged in conduct stifling fair ""competition,"" not that competitors can only compete 
with Mattel (when Mattel is competing fairly) with court assistance. That MGA may benefit from fair ""competition"" does not imply 
that MGA seeks only the protection of ""competitors."" See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 352-53, 
109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissent) (""The antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of 
competition, not competitors. This proposition . . . cannot be read to deny all remedial actions by competitors. When competitors 
are injured by [conduct that violates the antitrust laws] rather than by the free play of market forces, the antitrust laws protect 
competitors precisely for the purpose of protecting competition."") (citations and quotation marks omitted). Mattel additionally 
argues that MGA's UCL claim fails because MGA has not alleged that Mattel's conduct harmed ""consumers."" However, by 
contending that Mattel's conduct inappropriately hindered inter-brand competition, MGA has necessarily alleged harm to 
consumers. See generally Amarel, 202 Cal. App. 3d at 142 (consumers benefit from ""full and unrestricted competition"")."
1115,7," Because of this holding, the court need not address MGA's other arguments as to why these paragraphs should not be 
stricken."
1115,8," The court notes, however, that HN10[
] the UCL does not allow for an individual to recover ""disgorgement of profits allegedly 
obtained by means of an unfair business practice . . . where [those] profits are neither money taken from a plaintiff nor funds in 
which the plaintiff has an ownership interest."" Korea Supply Co., 29 Cal. 4th at 1140. "
1117,9," The court takes judicial notice of this document. See Parrino v. FHP Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 706 (9th Cir. 1998) HN15[
] (""a 
district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may consider a document the authenticity of which is not contested, and upon which 
the plaintiff's complaint necessarily relies""). "
1118,10," MGA attempts to avoid this result by arguing that the Brewer litigation does not provide a ""basis"" for its UCL claim, but merely 
""evidence"" of Mattel's unfair business. practices. See Opp. at 20-21 (citing White v. Western Title Ins. Co., 40 Cal. 3d 870, 888, 
221 Cal. Rptr. 509, 710 P.2d 309 (1985) (""[There is] a careful distinction between a cause of action based squarely on a 
privileged communication, such as an action for defamation, and one based upon an underlying course of conduct evidenced by 
the communication.""); Stacy & Witbeck, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 36 Cal. App. 4th 1074, 1091, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
472 (1995) (""[A]lthough section 47, subdivision (b), bars certain tort causes of action predicated on a judicial statement or 
publication, it does not create an evidentiary privilege for those statements. Thus, as an example, those statements can be used 
for evidentiary purposes to determine a person's intent.""); Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss & Karma, 
42 Cal. 3d 1157, 232 Cal. Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202 (1986) (in abuse of process action, plaintiff may use statements made 
during settlement negotiations in prior suit as ""evidence"" of defendant's improper ""ulterior"" purpose in initiating prior suit)). MGA, 
however, misrepresents the nature of its Complaint. Reading the Complaint as a whole, it is clear that the allegations in 
paragraph 75 provide one of the ""bases"" upon which MGA rests its claim that Mattel engaged in ""unfair competition."" The 
allegations in paragraph 75 are not mere ""evidence"" tending to show an element of some other cause of action, such as 
malicious prosecution or abuse of process. Indeed, MGA itself appears to admit as much in a separate portion of its opposition. 
See Opp. at 1-2 (describing its allegations, including those based upon the Brewer litigation, as being ""at the heart of Mattel's 
anti-competitive behavior""). Consequently, MGA's allegations regarding the Brewer litigation are subject to the litigation privilege. 
See Dong v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, 191 Cal. App. 3d 1572, 1594, 236 Cal. Rptr. 912 (1987) 
(documents subject to litigation privilege if they provide ""the nuclei"" for causes of action); Block v. Sacramento Clinical Labs, 
Inc., 131 Cal. App. 3d 386, 392-93, 182 Cal. Rptr. 438 (1982) (privilege applies where litigation-related conduct is ""the actionable 
wrong""). "
1123,1,"  The '790 and '164 patents relate to label systems for reusable containers. The patents were issued by the United States Patent 
and Trademark Office to Robert J. Petrou on May 23, 1995 and May 8, 2001, respectively. Plaintiff MPT is the assignee of all 
rights in both the '790 and '164 patents. "
1125,2," As of the date of the filing of defendants' Motion, the non-expert discovery and Markman brief deadline was September 1, 
2005, and the expert discovery and dispositive motion deadline was January 15, 2006. On August 24, 2005, however, this Court 
granted the parties' joint motion to extend the discovery deadlines by forty-five days. Thus, although the Court does not agree 
that ""this action is in its infancy,"" the Court does agree that discovery has not yet been concluded. "
1126,3," In so doing, the circuit court noted that the district court's determination that Exzec had adequately pled bad faith was not 
before it."
1126,4,"  In their Motion, defendants assert that MPT's cease-and-desist letter was sent in bad faith because the accused products do not, 
in fact, infringe the '790 and '164 patents. Specifically, defendants claim that the patents at issue (1) are invalid over prior art not 
considered by the U.S. PTO and (2) only claim methods of using the products. (Motion at 3)."
1126,5," Marathon Labels and Polymeric's proposed Amended Answers and Counterclaims are attached as Exhibits A and B to 
defendants' Motion for Leave to Amend."
1126,6," Significantly, MPT does not argue that leave to amend should be denied on grounds of undue delay and/or prejudice. Further, 
MPT does not argue that defendants' proposed counterclaims fail to adequately allege the specific elements of an unfair 
competition claim under either ยง 43(a) of the Lanham Act or Ohio common law. "
1127,7," This is the case because MPT is essentially arguing that defendants' motion for leave should be denied on the grounds that 
defendants' proposed federal and state law unfair competition claims are not ""properly assertable"" as a matter of law and, thus, it 
would be futile to allow amendment. "

] Because this appeal arises from the district court's grant of Elan's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the facts are 
derived from the allegations in Andrx's complaint, which we must accept as true, and are presented in the light most favorable to 
Andrx. See Ortega v. Christian, 85 F.3d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir. 1996). We need not accept as true, however, conclusory legal 
allegations made in the complaint. See Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1304 n.12 (11th 
Cir. 2003), cert. denied 541 U.S. 1037, 124 S. Ct. 2094, 158 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2004). Because the district court denied Andrx leave

1144,3," Although SkyePharma was also a named defendant in Andrx's first amended complaint, Andrx settled and voluntarily 
dismissed its claims against SkyePharma. See R2-73 at 1. "
1145,4," Patent law provides that a patent shall not be granted if the invention was ""described in a printed publication in this or a foreign 
country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United 
States."" 35 U.S.C. ยง 102. This statutory provision is termed the ""on-sale bar"" to patent validity. See Ferag AG v. Quipp Inc., 45 
F.3d 1562, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Because Elan purportedly advertised its controlled release naproxen for sale in the publication 
SCRIP World Pharmaceutical News, Andrx argued that the on-sale bar was triggered, thereby invalidating the '320 patent. 
Andrx's arguments notwithstanding, the district court found that the SCRIP publication did not trigger the on-sale bar. See Elan 
Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1325, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2002). The district court did find, however, that a letter 
written by Elan to Lederle Laboratories in 1987 triggered the on-sale bar and invalidated the '320 patent. Id. at 1349. This latter 
finding was reversed by the Federal Circuit, which remanded Elan's patent infringement suit for further proceedings. See Elan 
Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 366 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2004)."
1145,5," As the district court noted, the Florida antitrust statutes, FLA. STAT. ch. 542.18 and ch. 542.19, closely track the language of

1159,3," On August 17, 2004, while the motion to amend was being briefed, plaintiffs' counsel, representing a separate plaintiff, also 
brought an action in the Northern District of California captioned Freeland v. AT&T Corp. The Freeland action, which was 
transferred to this Court by the JPMDL in November 2004 and is now captioned 04 Civ. 8653 (DLC), not only alleges that the 
defendants in this action have engaged in collective action to tie the sale of handsets to wireless services, but also charges that 
by engaging in certain practices, the defendants have entered into a conspiracy to restrain trade and contracts in restraint of "
1160,," trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and a conspiracy to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 
Plaintiffs' motion for an order setting a pretrial schedule in the Freeland action is pending, as is defendants' cross-motion to 
dismiss the Freeland action as duplicative."
1160,4," On February 25, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. Because of the resolution of the instant motion, it is 
unnecessary to rule on that motion."
1160,5," Since the mid-to-late 1990s, another frequency block, referred to as SMR spectrum, has also been used for wireless telephone 
services."
1160,6," The two other digital technologies are TDMA, which is now obsolete and from which Cingular and AT&T Wireless are 
switching, and iDEN, the technology used by non-party Nextel. "
1161,7," The parties dispute which entities can appropriately be called handset manufacturers. The defendants contend that companies 
that develop and build handsets and then sell them under different brand names should be considered manufacturers. The 
plaintiffs, by contrast, argue that only the company listed as a handset's manufacturer should be considered as such."
1161,8," The plaintiffs argue, by way of citation to the expert report of Nicholas Economides, that even though the wholesale prices for 
digital handsets have dropped since 2000, they were artificially inflated between 1999 and 2003 as a direct result of the 
defendants' tying arrangements. For reasons that will be described below, Economides's analysis of handset prices cannot be 
admitted into evidence. "
1162,9," A substantial share of plaintiffs' evidentiary submissions regarding locking concerns the defendants' coordinated efforts, 
primarily through various wireless industry organizations, to promulgate handset locks as an industry standard by requiring 
manufacturers to incorporate such locks in handsets developed for use with their respective networks."
1162,10," Verizon does not define, however, what it means by ""postpay."""
1162,11," Sprint, which also admits to locking handsets, cites similar justifications for locking."
1162,12," Pursuant to an agreement with the plaintiffs, approximately one dozen contracts were produced and served as a sample. This 
paragraph also relies on the declaration of Thomas Bryant, an associate director for indirect distribution for Verizon Wireless. 
The plaintiffs have moved to strike the Bryant declaration, inter alia, because he did not sufficiently disclose the bases of his 
personal knowledge and on other grounds. The motion to strike is denied; the defendants have cured any relevant deficiencies. 
This Opinion determines that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment even if they control sales and distribution in the 
U.S. handset market. "
1163,13," As the FCC related in 2004, Verizon Wireless's national system was based on a combination of wireless-owned systems (Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, GTE) 
with those accumulated and consolidated by Vodafone (including AirTouch). Cingular was formed by merging SBC's 
(including former SNET, PacBell, and Ameritech) and BellSouth's systems. T-Mobile acquired the systems constructed and 
combined by VoiceStream and Omnipoint. Mem. Op. & Order,  Applications of AT&T Wireless Servs., Inc. and Cingular Wireless Corp. for Consent to Transfer Control of 
Licenses and Authorizations, 19 FCC Rcd 21522 (2004) (""AT&T/Cingular Order"")."
1163,14," Through an August 8, 2005 memorandum opinion and order, the FCC approved the merger of Sprint and Nextel. See Mem. 
Op. & Order,  Applications of Nextel Comm., Inc. and Sprint Corp. for Consent to Transfer Control of Licenses and 
Authorizations, 2005 FCC LEXIS 4524, FCC 05-148, WC Docket No. 05-63 (Aug. 8 ,2005) (""Sprint/Nextel Order""). In an August 
16, 2005 letter, the defendants argue that this order, which concludes that the wireless services industry is characterized by 
vigorous competition and that the national service providers are each substitutes for one another, should be considered in 
connection with this motion. Because the briefing of this motion was completed before the issuance of the Sprint/Nextel Order, it 
will not be relied upon in reaching the merits of the defendants' motions."
1163,15," The plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of the FCC's findings, but instead dispute their import, arguing that they do not 
address the defendants' alleged tying arrangements. "
1164,16," Again, the plaintiffs do not challenge the FCC's findings in the AT&T/Cingular Order but argue that the order ""does not address 
the issue of tying in the context of the merger."" "
1166,17," While continuing to list proof of market power as an essential component of a tying claim, the Second Circuit has not yet 
addressed the ramifications of the Jefferson Parish majority and concurring opinions in any detail. In Gonzalez, the sole 
occasion on which our Circuit has even commented on the divergence between the Jefferson Parish majority and Justice 
O'Connor's concurrence, the Honorable Wilfred Feinberg observed that despite ""weaknesses in the per se tying analysis,"" the 
court was obligated to ""adhere to the views of a majority of the Supreme Court, which has not abandoned the per se test.""  
Gonzalez, 880 F.2d at 1519."
1166,18," In adopting Justice O'Connor's framework for analysis of all tying claims, the Sixth Circuit noted that in  Eastman Kodak, 504 
U.S. at 451, issued eight years after  Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 2, the majority opinion did not even mention the terms per se 
or rule of reason.  PSI, 104 F.3d at 815 n.2. "
1167,19," Despite the repeated emphasis of the Jefferson Parish Court on the importance of proof of market power to a tying claim, 
some courts have fixated on the fact that, after finding that the defendant did not have sufficient market power to warrant 
application of a per se tying analysis, the Court proceeded to analyze the claim without further discussion of the defendant's 
market power. Having already accepted that the defendant had a 30 percent market share,  466 U.S. at 26, a number it 
characterized as ""far from overwhelming,"" id., there was no obvious need for the Court to discuss the defendant's market power 
further. When the entire Jefferson Parish decision is read, and even more so when it is read with the other decisions that 
comprise the Court's tying jurisprudence, it is obvious that proof of market power remains a critical component of a tying claim."
1167,20," Defendants acknowledge that Cingular and AT&T Wireless's combined market share in 2003 was 29 percent. Cingular and 
AT&T Wireless did not even announce, much less complete, their merger until 2004. Given that the defendants assert that the 
plaintiffs' tying claims target the period 1998 through 2003, and the plaintiffs do not contest that they and their experts have 
relied entirely on data from this period to support their tying claims and to estimate their purported damages, it is not necessary 
to contemplate Cingular's post-merger market share. "
1168,21," In denying the motion to dismiss the tying claim, this Court noted that the precise amount of market power necessary to prevail 
on a tying claim remains an open question, citing a footnote in Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Jefferson Parish in which she 
also described Northern Pacific as requiring ""only a minimal showing of market power.""  In re Wireless, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13886, 2003 WL 21912603, at *7. "
1169,22," Visa's share of the more broadly defined market was 43 to 47 percent, and was nearly 60 percent of the narrower market. "
1170,23," A mobile virtual network operator orders handsets from a large handset manufacturer and resells network capacity leased at 
wholesale rates from a major wireless service provider."
1170,24," An oligopoly is defined as ""control or domination of a market by a few large sellers, creating high prices and low output similar 
to those found in a monopoly."" Black's Law Dictionary 1120 (8th ed. 2004). To the extent that the plaintiffs are using their 
reference to oligopoly to reposition their tying claim as a conspiracy claim, that effort fails. The plaintiffs abandoned their 
conspiracy claim long ago and it would prejudice the defendants at this late stage to allow a reformulation in this consolidated 
lawsuit of plaintiffs' legal theories. "
1171,25," Marginal cost is defined as ""the additional cost incurred in producing one more unit of output."" Black's Law Dictionary 372 (8th 
ed. 2004)."
1171,26," In their opposition brief, the plaintiffs solely rely on testimony of defendants' expert Jerry Hausman in which he agreed that 
every defendant prices above marginal cost. Through their Rule 56.1 Statement, plaintiffs also note, however, that in a 2000 
academic article, Hausman estimated the marginal cost of providing wireless services to be 5 cents per minute. They further 
note that at his deposition, Hausman acknowledged that ""it's quite likely"" that the marginal cost of service has declined since 
then."
1171,27," The plaintiffs' brief in opposition to this motion creates an argument based on the Lerner Index. Specifically, the plaintiffs note 
Hausman's expert report states, using data from a 2004 FCC report, that average revenue per minute, often used as a proxy for 
price, was 29 cents per minute in 1998 and 10 cents per minute in 2003. Using Hausman's academic estimate of marginal cost 
and these estimates of prices, the plaintiffs have computed a Lerner Index of .85 for 1998 and .5 for 2003. The plaintiffs, 
however, have presented no expert report regarding the significance of that Index in this case, and in particular its implications 
for a conclusion that any defendant had market power. See  United States v. Eastman Kodak, 63 F.3d 95, 109 (2d Cir. 1995) 
(rejecting use of Lerner Index as a measure of market power where defendant is not the ""seller of a differentiated product that 
sets prices independently of its rivals""). "
1172,28," The defendants explain that term contracts help carriers recover customer acquisition costs and allow them to charge lower 
prices and to subsidize handsets in the hope that they will be able to recover the investment. There is no need to address the 
merits of this argument since the plaintiffs have failed to raise a question of fact that term contracts either create or reflect market 
power by any one defendant. "
1173,29," The plaintiffs have devoted some attention to creating a historical picture of the handset market. For instance, to demonstrate 
how the handset market has changed since the evolution of digital service, the plaintiffs cite the testimony of Peter Skarzynski, a 
former employee of AT&T Wireless's consumer products division. According to Skarzynski, during his 1994 through 1997 tenure 
at AT&T, the consumer products division not only sold handsets to retailers such as Sears and Best Buy ""without the 
involvement of the carrier,"" but such handsets ""could be purchased by consumers and then activated with the service of a carrier 
of the consumer's choice."" In a similar vein, the plaintiffs rely on the testimony of their expert, Robert Zicker, who stated that 
during the analog age, ""the technologies were all compatible and an attempt to limit [a consumer's] source of handsets wouldn't 
be too effective"" as the retailers had ""a multitude of different places they could buy handsets from."" Yet without any showing that 
manufacturers were precluded from the U.S. handset market as of the time that the defendants' alleged tying practices were 
imposed or since, such historical reflection has little relevance."
1173,30," While the plaintiffs repeatedly argue that a manufacturer must have a ""business relationship"" with a carrier in order to sell 
handsets in the U.S., they have failed to define precisely what such a business relationship entails. In some instances, the 
plaintiffs' conception of ""doing business"" seems to mean a carrier's purchasing a certain manufacturer's handsets. At other 
times, however, the plaintiffs suggest that a manufacturer's doing business with a carrier involves ""working with carriers to put 
out a product that matches their requirements."" At no point have the plaintiffs explicitly argued, much less proven, that any "
1174,," defendant's control over which handsets will be approved for use with its respective network has actually foreclosed 
manufacturers from the market for handset sales in the U.S."
1174,31," The same LG representative also testified that LG's entry into the market was ""tough but not impossible"" and that the 
packaged sales of handsets and service ""helps,"" rather than hinders, LG's business because ""you can't run the product without 
service. It has to run on a network."""
1174,32," There is evidence that directly contradicts the plaintiffs' contention that all handset sales flow through the carriers' distribution 
system. For example, some manufacturers, such as Kyocera, do directly sell handsets through their website and are ""more than 
happy to sell the phone without a [service] plan."" "
1175,33," Multiple regression analysis is a commonly accepted statistical tool used to examine ""the effect of independent variables on a 
dependent variable.""  Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999). The parties do not dispute that the retail and 
wholesale prices for digital handsets have declined annually since the year 2000. The plaintiffs argue, however, that the decline 
would have been greater but for tying. "
1176,34," Through a letter of May 31, 2005, the plaintiffs requested leave to file a sur-reply to the defendants' motion to exclude 
Economides's report, inter alia, on the ground that the defendants' reply ""presented new arguments that plaintiffs have not had a 
fair opportunity to respond to."" Because no arguments raised for the first time in defendants' reply have been relied upon with 
respect to the admissibility of Economides's regression analysis, the request to file a sur-reply is denied."
1176,35, A handset with multiple SIM slots would allow a consumer to switch between carriers. 
1177,36," The plaintiffs define Bluetooth technology as ""short-range wireless computer connectivity."""
1177,37," The plaintiffs' attempt to demonstrate, through Economides's rebuttal report's citation to a January 2005 Wall Street Journal 
article, that Verizon Wireless has suppressed the introduction of Bluetooth technology, fails as well. Even assuming that the 
article were admissible, the plaintiffs have not shown that such conduct by Verizon impacted the handset market as a whole."
1177,38," The first, from June 1995, contains an AirTouch employee's analysis that handset locks ""allow[] a carrier to control churn."" The 
second, an undated AT&T Wireless document, similarly explains that AT&T locks handsets to ""make[] it costly for the subscriber 
to switch to another carrier."" The third document, a February 19, 2004 AT&T Wireless analysis, determines that if customers 
could obtain unlocked handsets, they ""could replace the carrier without investment in a new device."""
1177,39," The plaintiffs alternately argue that the defendants' tying arrangements allow them to lock handsets and that handset locks 
serve, by inhibiting the availability of unlocked handsets, to ""reinforce the tie."" For the reasons discussed above, the plaintiffs 
have not shown that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether handset locking creates an anticompetitive effect. The plaintiffs' 
second argument, that the defendants enforce their respective tying arrangements by locking handsets, reveals the fundamental 
deficiency of their tying claim. A defendant with market power in the tying product market needs no other aid to implement a 
tying arrangement successfully; rather, by virtue of its control over the tying product market, it is able to diminish competition in 
the tied product market and force consumers to accept a tying arrangement they would otherwise resist. The plaintiffs' argument, 
through their expert Robert Zicker, that the defendants were not successful in tying until locking was available underscores this 
basic point."
1177,40," As a matter of logic, the need for consumers to buy new handsets when they switch plans should increase competition in the 
handset market. Defendants contend and plaintiffs do not disagree that the defendants use their offers of handsets at the lowest "
1178,," possible prices to compete with each other. The increased sales of handsets that result from this practice and the incentive to 
use handset innovations as a draw to bring new customers to a new service provider foster competition in the tied product 
market."
1178,41," The parties have been ordered to file in the public record the bulk of their motion papers, which they initially filed under seal. 
The Court retains jurisdiction over that unsealing process. "
1181,*," The Honorable James L. Robart, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation. "
1182,1," The packaging when the Prebate program was launched in 1997 contained slightly different language: IMPORTANT! READ BEFORE OPENING. Opening this package or using the cartridge inside confirms your acceptance to 
the following license agreement. License Agreement: Patent cartridge inside sold subject to Single Use Only restriction. 
It is a violation of this agreement and/or it is unlawful to resell, reuse, refill or remanufacture. If you don't agree, return 
unopened package to point of purchase."
1182,2," According to Lexmark, its post-sale restriction on reusing the Prebate cartridges does not require consumers to return the 
cartridge at all; it only precludes giving the cartridge to another remanufacturer. The plain language of the contract does not 
clearly reflect this position. However, the distinction drawn by Lexmark is unnecessary to our resolution of the present case, 
which is not a direct challenge to the terms of the contract itself. "
1183,3," The Sixth Circuit described the chip's functioning as a ""secret handshake"" between the printer and the chip in each cartridge.  
Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control, 387 F.3d 522, 530 (6th Cir. 2004) (addressing copyright infringement action against rival chip 
maker). ""If the two values do not match each other, the printer returns an error message and will not operate, blocking 
consumers from using toner cartridges that Lexmark has not authorized."" Id."
1183,4," California's Proposition 64, passed in November 2004, amended the statute to prohibit unaffected plaintiffs from bringing suit 
on behalf of the general public. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยง 17204. Under this change, ACRA may lack standing to assert that 
Lexmark is deceiving consumers or engaging in unfair competitive practices that harm consumers. However, California courts 
are split on whether this requirement applies retroactively to cases that have not been fully adjudicated. Compare  Bivens v. 
Corel Corp., 126 Cal. App. 4th 1392, 24 Cal.Rptr. 3d 847 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005) (finding plaintiff lacked standing because it was 
not affected), review granted,  28 Cal. Rptr. 3d 3, 110 P.3d 1218 (Cal. 2005), with  Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn's, "
1184,," LLC, 126 Cal. App. 4th 386, 24 Cal.Rptr. 3d 301 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005) (finding the standing requirement to apply only 
prospectively), review granted,  28 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 110 P.3d 1216 (Cal. 2005). Because we affirm the district court's grant of 
summary judgment, we do not address the effect of Proposition 64 on ACRA's claim, if any. "
1185,5," The Electronic Frontier Foundation, in its amicus brief, argues that Mallinckrodt was wrongly decided and urges us to reject 
explicitly the Federal Circuit's reasoning. However, ACRA has not challenged the district court's reliance on or application of 
Mallinckrodt. Thus, we need not pass on the merits of the Federal Circuit's decision for resolution of the case before us."
1185,6," This case is different from those instances in which a consumer lacks notice of the condition at the time of purchase. See, e.g.,  
Step-Saver Data Sys. v. Wyse Tech., Inc., 939 F.2d 91, 105 (3d Cir. 1991) (treating box-top license as an additional term not 
incorporated into the parties' contract where the term's addition to the contract would materially alter the agreement and the 
consumer did not see license until after paying for product). Another variant involves ""shrinkwrap licenses"" on software, which 
impose restrictions that a consumer may discover only after opening and installing the software. See e.g.,  ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 
86 F.3d 1447, 1452-53 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that contract included license agreement terms that appeared on screen even 
though they came after user had purchased, opened and installed software)."
1185,7," Lexmark represents that it has not taken legal action against any user for failing to return a cartridge to Lexmark because it 
""assumes customers will be honest and send cartridges back."" To the extent that Lexmark fails to enforce its Prebate policy, a 
consumer receives the benefit of the bargain through the price reduction without necessarily having to carry through on its 
obligation to return the cartridges to Lexmark. "
1186,8," Our holding here does not preclude challenges to the contract that a customer -- which, unlike ACRA, is a party to the contract 
-- could raise. "
1193,1," Originally, the Merchants moved on March 24, 2005, to enjoin an action in Tennessee, Bennett v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Case 
No. 24139 (Tenn. Ch. Ct. filed Feb. 17, 2005) (""Bennett II""). On March 29, 2005, they sought to enjoin Ratner as well. As the 
motions were virtually identical, I scheduled them for a joint oral argument. Oral argument was held on June 3, 2005. By letter 
dated June 20, 2005, the Merchants sought to withdraw their motion with respect to Bennett II. I granted that request on June 
29, 2005. Accordingly, this decision addresses only the motion to enjoin Ratner. "
1195,2," Another factor mentioned in the court's decision denying the injunction in Alton Box was that the district judge who denied the 
injunction was in the Northern District of California, but the district judge overseeing the MDL proceeding was in the Southern 
District of Texas. Thus, the Northern District of California had no ""jurisdiction"" to preserve. Alton Box, 682 F.2d at 1271. "
1197,3," The Consumers conceded at oral argument that they are not alleging knowing complicity by every merchant who accepted 
debit cards. ""I think we would be hard-pressed to say that every, every merchant . . . was part of the conspiracy. But certainly, 
Wal-Mart was and they knew about it and they participated in it."" (Tr. at 20.) "

1206,1," Xerox's motion is only a motion for partial summary judgment. It does not, for example, address (a) CCS's claim that Xerox 
engaged in anti-competitive conduct other than ""refusal to deal,"" or (b) CCS's claim that Xerox restarted its refusal to deal after 
the 1994 consent decree."
1206,2," Admittedly, there is some evidence that on occasion Xerox either reduced or rejected some CCS parts orders prior to 1989. 
(Xerox Ex. B; Dixon Dep. at 348-52) Construed in CCS's favor, that evidence only demonstrates that Xerox was not entirely 
willing to deal with end-user ISOs prior to 1989. It is, however, still consistent with a finding that, for the most part, Xerox was 
willing to deal with end-user ISOs prior to 1989, and, for the most part, was not willing to deal with them after 1989. (That is, of 
course, not the only inference that could be drawn from the evidence, but it is a reasonable one, which I must draw when 
deciding a motion for summary judgment.) "
1207,3," CCS also argues that the prior decision of the District of Kansas, when this case was consolidated as part of a multi-district 
litigation, settled the question whether the 1989 actions constituted an independent act. That argument has no merit. HN4[
] 
The Kansas decisions were not findings of fact, they were resolutions of motions, and the facts used by the court in deciding 
those motions were assumed true only for the purposes of those motions. They are, consequently, not binding on Xerox or this 
court. "
1208,4," The letter does not, however, establish conclusively that this was Xerox's policy as of 1986. There is evidence that Xerox 
subsequently relented and allowed CCS to order some of the requested parts. (Xerox Ex. D) Moreover, as explained above, 
supra n.2, the fact that on occasion Xerox reduced parts orders does not compel a conclusion that it had by then made a final 
refusal to deal. "
1214,1," The Court will cite to the portions of depositions attached to Plaintiff's briefs as, e.g., ""Miller Dep. at 10."" Citations to the 
portions of depositions attached to Defendant's briefs will appear as, e.g., ""Miller Dep. (Def.) at 10."" "
1215,2," Although the Marketing Agreement was signed by the parties some time in late September 2001, the agreement contained an 
effective date of April 1, 2001. The record provides no explanation for this discrepancy. (Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Partial 
Summ. J., Ex. 23.) "
1216,3," The parties dispute the contents of the remainder of their conversation on March 7, 2002. Miller maintains that he advised 
Watts of the business demands on Vol-State and his temporary inability to devote more time to development of the Product. 
(Miller Aff. P 3; Miller Dep. at 168; Miller Dep. (Def.) at 192, 196; Miller Dep. Vol. II (Def.) at 63.) Watts denies that Miller 
mentioned this time commitment to Vol-State in any fashion. (Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Ex. O, Charles 
D. Watts, Jr. Dep. Vol. II at 15.) "
1217,4," The parties disagree whether Miller attempted to contact Watts about the March 11th letter. Miller maintains that he attempted 
to call an NC Mutual representative, Art Davis, and Watts at least twice, leaving messages that were not returned. (Miller Aff. P 
6; Miller Dep. (Def.) at 152, 188-89, 204; Miller Dep. Vol. II (Def.) at 28.) Watts maintains that he always returns his calls, and 
that if Miller had called him, he would have been informed of the call and returned it. (Watts Dep. Vol. II at 14.) "
1218,5," NC Mutual also argues that the March 11th letter was not an anticipatory breach because NC Mutual possessed the right under 
the Marketing Agreement to withdraw the Product from the market and terminate the Marketing Agreement at any time and in its 
sole discretion. NC Mutual asserts that it would have withdrawn the Product if Basic Medical had challenged NC Mutual's right to 
send the March 11th letter. This argument fails. The Court will not adjudicate this matter on the basis of what NC Mutual might 
have done differently if it had the wisdom of hindsight. "
1220,6," NC Mutual also argues that ""insofar as BMCP contends that the Marketing Agreement limits or prohibits NCM from making a 
request for reasonable assurances as set forth in the March 11 letter, the Court should deem those parts of the Marketing 
Agreement . . . to be invalid for failure of the parties to reach a meeting of the minds, as the right to request reasonable 
assurances was an implied and understood material term of the agreement."" (Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. 
J. at 16.) The Court disagrees. The general right to request reasonable assurances is not challenged by Basic Medical. Rather, it 
is the ""right"" to request reasonable assurances based on ""interpolated"" quarterly sales requirements that is challenged, and the 
Court finds that this supposed ""right"" was not ""an implied and understood material term of the agreement."" "
1221,7," Charles Welch had been the Senior Vice President for Agency Operations at NC Mutual prior to accepting the position of North 
Carolina State Manager with Basic Medical in September, 2001. (Compl. P 20, Ex. B.) "
1224,8," Because of the Court's holding limiting Basic Medical to nominal damages, the Court need not and does not reach NC Mutual's 
argument that Basic Medical failed to mitigate its damages. It is worth noting, however, that the evidence is uncontroverted that 
Basic Medical took no steps to mitigate damages, and its failure to mitigate would be a great obstacle to any substantial 
recovery by Basic Medical under any theory of lost profits. "
1230,1," The cases cited by Plaintiffs highlight that the October 18 Opinion lacks any limiting instructions of the type included by the 
Appellate Court when it intends to restrict proceedings following remand. See Ginett v. Computer Task Group, Inc., 11 F.3d 359, 
360-61 (2d Cir. 1993); Ginett v. Computer Task Group, Inc., 962 F.2d 1085, 1101 (2d Cir. 1992); Day v. Morgenthau, 909 F.2d 
75, 78 (2d Cir. 1990). "

1249,1, Citations to the various provisions of the MSA have been omitted
1249,2," Plaintiffs also allege many facts that are immaterial to the current motion. Plaintiffs assert that the MSA and its implementing 
statutes have been ineffective in reducing smoking and that a flat tax on cigarettes would be more effective, but the 
effectiveness of a state policy is irrelevant to the question of whether the state statute will be preempted. See Hoover v. Ronwin, 
466 U.S. 558, 574, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590, 104 S. Ct. 1989 (1984) (noting that the Supreme Court has never ""suggested . . . that a 
state action is exempt from antitrust liability only if the sovereign acted wisely""). Plaintiffs also devote substantial space to 
showing that the Settling States' motivations were purely directed toward raising revenue, and that in effect the Settling States 
entered into a conspiracy with the OPMs to violate the Sherman Act. However, a state's subjective motivations in enacting 
legislation are irrelevant to whether that legislation can be challenged under the antitrust laws, see Consol. Television Cable 
Serv., Inc. v. City of Frankfort, 857 F.2d 354, 362 (6th Cir. 1988), and there is no conspiracy exception to state action immunity. 
See Mich. Paytel Joint Venture v. City of Detroit, 287 F.3d 527, 535 (6th Cir. 2001). "
1250,3," It is not entirely clear whether Plaintiffs have withdrawn their claim that the challenged statutes constitute special legislation 
under Section 59 of the Kentucky Constitution. In listing the claims being withdrawn, Plaintiffs only explicitly mentioned their 
federal constitutional claims, but they also cited the Fourth Count of their Amended Complaint, which was composed solely of 
the state constitutional claim, and Plaintiffs did not devote any space to defending that claim in their response to this motion. In 
any case, the challenged statutes are not prohibited special legislation since they are based on ""a reasonable and natural 
distinction which relates to the purpose of the act,"" namely, the distinction between NPMs and Participating Manufacturers, and 
the legislation ""applies equally to all in a class."" St. Luke Hosp., Inc. v. Health Policy Bd., 913 S.W.2d 1, 3, 43 1 Ky. L. Summary 
13 (Ky. App. 1996). "
1251,4," Plaintiffs do not address the third prong of the Rice standard, ""irresistible pressure,"" in either their Amended Complaint or their 
Response to the Motion to Dismiss. Reading Plaintiffs' allegations in the most favorable light, this Court cannot find that the 
Plaintiffs have alleged the existence of irresistible pressures. Plaintiffs' allegations demonstrate that the output cartel allows the 
participating manufacturers to extract supracompetitive profits. This Court is unaware of any precedent suggesting that 
legislation facilitating anticompetitive conduct creates irresistible pressure to engage in such conduct, nor indeed is this Court 
aware of any case from the Supreme Court, the Sixth Circuit, or any other federal court actually finding preemption under the 
""irresistible pressure"" standard in the absence of an explicit statutory mandate. "
1252,5," The Court notes that although Xcaliber is unreported, both parties devoted substantial space to it in their briefs."
1252,6," Plaintiffs also cite two decisions by the Third Circuit in passing, but do not rely heavily on them in their argument, which is 
probably just as well. In the first case, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine (which was 
not raised in this case) of a suit brought by NPMs against Participating Manufacturers, and then went on to opine that if the case 
had not been dismissed under Noerr-Pennington, it would also not have been dismissed under the doctrine of state action 
immunity. A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 263 F.3d 239 (3d Cir. 2001). In a subsequent case brought against 
the State of Pennsylvania seeking to enjoin the enforcement of its implementing statutes, the Third Circuit also dismissed the 
suit under Noerr-Pennington, and then added a discussion that cast considerable doubt on the logic of Bedell, suggesting that 
the court in Bedell had ""unintentionally"" found the absence of state action immunity for the state, although the court declined to 
actually overrule the prior opinion. Mariana v. Fisher, 338 F.3d 189, 203 (3d Cir. 2003). "
1253,7," 324 Liquor Corp. is the only Supreme Court case to strike down a law using the term ""hybrid restraint, "" and none of the other 
cases cited above actually use the term, but Plaintiffs and others have characterized the statutory schemes in those cases as 
""hybrid restraints,"" and the usage is consistent with the definition in 324 Liquor Corp. See, e.g. Rice. 458 U.S. at 665-66 
(Stevens, J., concurring). The Sixth Circuit has never adopted the concept of a ""hybrid restraint"" for use in its analysis. "
1273,1," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2, prohibits monopolization or attempts to monopolize: ""Every person who shall 
monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."" "
1274,2," There is also an exception to the Noerr-Pennington immunity for litigation based on patents that are procured by fraud. See 
Walker Process Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). This exception 
does not apply to the instant case. "
1275,3," Obviously this decision has no binding effect on this Court, and is consulted in an effort to flesh out a cogent analysis. "
1276,4," The Relafen court states: ""a court may, in the course of resolving the underlying litigation, make findings tantamount to a 
finding that the [litigant's conduct] was objectively baseless, Judge Lindsay's findings were not clearly and convincingly of this 
sort. Judge Lindsay's findings did not, for example, describe conduct that was indefensible on its face. Rather, Judge Lindsay 
discredited SmithKline's claims only after the careful testing of trial."" In Re Relafen, 346 F.Supp. 2d at 364. This seems to 
suggest that the trial court sitting for the underlying litigation must show, through its opinions and memorandum, that the suit is 
objectively baseless by clear and convincing evidence--or alternatively--that a plaintiff can rely on a trial court's findings in the 
underlying suit if they are clear and convincing. This too confuses what should be a straightforward analysis of the objective 
merits of the underlying patent litigation. An analysis which puts the burden squarely on the plaintiff."
1276,5," The defendant in Relafen relied heavily on the fact that it had survived summary judgment in the underlying patent infringement 
litigation to demonstrate that the suit was not objectively baseless. The court rejected their argument. "
1277,6," Even cases prior to PRE examined the whole record of the underlying suit to determine whether it was a sham. See, e.g., 
Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358, 1359 (5th Cir. 1983). "
1280,7," A Tenth Circuit panel of judges affirmed the district court's finding. However, Judge Ebel, in a prescient dissent disagreed with 
the panel. Judge Ebel questioned whether it was appropriate to extend Noerr-Pennington immunity to purely private threats of 
litigation. Judge Ebel offered a three-part test to determine whether private litigation threats should receive immunity under 
Noerr-Pennington. Under that test a litigant seeking Noerr-Pennington immunity would have to show that the threat was: (1) 
made in good faith; (2) was objectively reasonable; and (3) was a ""proximate prologue to actual or imminent litigation."" 182 F.3d 
at 1142. In the present case, Dyno would be able to establish, under our ruling today, all three of these elements. First, there is a 
presumption that patent infringement litigation is brought in good faith. See C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Systems, Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 
1369 (Fed. Cir 1998) (citing Virtue v. Creamery Package Mfg. Co., 227 U.S. 8, 37-38, 33 S. Ct. 202, 57 L. Ed. 393, 1913 Dec. 
Comm'r Pat. 519 (1913). Such a presumption is only overcome by affirmative evidence of bad faith. Here there has been no 
showing by LDE that Dyno's Patent Litigation was brought in bad faith. Second, as discussed at length, this Court feels that the 
underlying patent litigation was not objectively baseless. The Court assumes that an objectively reasonable standard would be 
substantially similar. Third, the threats of litigation were a ""proximate prologue to actual or imminent litigation."""

] The privacy of consumers who purchase prescription medication is protected under the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-91. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320d-2. HIPAA protects 
""protected health information"" from disclosure. ""Protected health information"" means individually identifiable health information 
that is maintained and/or transmitted in any form or medium. 45 C.F.R. ยง 160.103 (2004). Pharmacists are health care providers

1306,5," When evaluating settlements in parens patriae actions brought by state Attorneys General under either the Clayton Act or 
comparable state laws, courts have generally utilized the standards used to analyze private class action settlements under Rule

1307,6," Five TPPs did initially opt out, but they soon entered into an agreement with the parties to request that the Court permit them to 
rescind their notices of exclusion. That agreement is reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding filed with the Court that 
guaranteed $ 450,000 more to the Settlement Fund, instead of going to Plaintiffs' Attorneys' Fees. The Court granted the 
request."
1307,7," Two objections were filed on behalf of TPPs, Health Care Service Corporation and certain Blue Cross entities; and eight were 
filed by consumers, Eugene Clasby, Roberta Geha, Rhonda Marcus, Nadine Street, William L. Bedford, Susan Ruth Hall, Dot K.

who spoke at the Fairness Hearing."
1307,8," As some objection points are entirely unsupported, too vague to comprehend, or clearly without merit, the Court only writes on 
those objections that require some explanation. "
1308,9, See supra note 6. 
1309,10," Several objectors also objected that they did not have access to the economic reports that were the basis of the Plan of 
Distribution, and objector Eugene Clasby made a motion to this effect. As a result, the Court ordered that End-Payor Plaintiffs 
make this underlying information available prior to the Fairness Hearing, which they did. The objection was not pursued at the 
Fairness Hearing and one TPP objector, the Blue Cross entities, withdrew its relevant objections. "
1311,11," To the extent End-Payor Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff States would advance an ""overall scheme"" claim, finding such a scheme 
would likely be predicated upon proving the late listing claim. "
1313,12," Class Counsel initially indicated they would request up to 25% of the Settlement Fund, as indicated in the notice that was sent 
to the class. They later reduced that number by providing $ 450,000 more to the class in order to prevent the terms of Rider A 
from terminating, as described in footnote 6. "
1314,13," These are the objections of Dot K. Kensigner, William L. Bedford III, Susan Ruth Hall, and Robert L. Kensinger, represented 
by Stephen Tsai. "
1315,14," Ms. Street also objected to the agreement between the litigating parties and five TPPs that initially opted out of the settlement 
which stated that, inter alia, Defendants would advance up to $ 500,000 of if they rescinded their notices of exclusion. By Order 
dated June 24, 2005, this Court rejected that part of the agreement, and the five TPPs were afforded absolutely no special 
treatment in exchange for returning to the class. Thus, Ms. Street's objection as to this point had been resolved before the 
objection was filed. See also supra notes 6 and 9 and accompanying text. "
1325,1," Harrison Aire's complaint included both federal antitrust counts and supplemental claims under state law. On May 3, 2004, the 
District Court granted Raven/Aerostar's motion for summary judgment in part, dismissing the antitrust counts and ordering trial 
on the state law counts. The parties then stipulated to final judgment with prejudice against Harrison Aire on the surviving claims, 
in order to facilitate an immediate appeal on the antitrust issues. Accordingly, the state law claims are not at issue and our 
analysis is confined to the federal antitrust claims. "
1336,1," The Amended Complaint is cited as ""Cmplt. P    ."" As noted earlier, the court is uncertain of the relationship, if any, among 
Plaintiff ""C. Pelfresne"" and other Pelfresnes who have filed similar complaints involving other Illinois municipalities. "
1337,2, The Complaint does not provide an explanation for the involuntary dissolution.

consider only whether Plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a violation of state law and an injury in fact, and not whether the 
declaratory judgment and the damages claims were duplicative. "

1349,11," Having determined that the Village Defendants are immune from liability under the Tort Immunity Act, the court need not 
address whether they are also entitled to legislative immunity. (Village Mem., at 7.) See Biblia Abierta v. Banks, 129 F.3d 899, 
903 (7th Cir. 1997) (""The doctrine of absolute legislative immunity recognizes that when acting collectively to pursue a view of

1352,1," Although the Second Amended Complaint states that the Contract is attached thereto, it is not attached to the copy of the 
Second Amended Complaint that was filed with the Court. It was, however, attached to the copy of the Second Amended "
1353,," Complaint Strawflower submitted to the Court in connection with its motion for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint. In 
any event, the Court may consider the Contract in ruling on the instant motion to dismiss, regardless of whether it is attached to 
the Complaint. See Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d at 454."
1353,2," Although Strawflower does not allege in its complaint that a fiduciary relationship arose as a result of a franchisor-franchisee 
relationship between RadioShack and Strawflower, the Court notes that Strawflower does suggest in its opposition that such a 
duty exists. (See Opp. at 22-23.) The Ninth Circuit repeatedly has held, however, that a fiduciary relationship is not created by a 
franchisor-franchisee relationship. See, e.g., Boat & Motor Mart v. Sea Ray Boats, Inc., 825 F.2d 1285, 1292 (9th Cir. 1987) 
(holding ""[t]he relation between a franchisor and a franchisee is not that of a fiduciary to a beneficiary"" and that ""[t]he California 
Franchise Relations Act has not imposed additional fiduciary duties on the franchisor""); Walker v. KFC Corp., 728 F.2d 1215, 
1221 n.5 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding California legislature, in enacting Franchise Investment Law, did not intend to impose fiduciary 
duty on franchisors). "
1355,3," Contrary to RadioShack's argument, the doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable, particularly in light of the Court's order of July 
26, 2005, granting Strawflower leave to amend."
1355,4," Strawflower defines the term ""RadioShack-branded product"" to mean ""a product with a label and packaging bearing the name 
'RadioShack.'"" (See SAC P 37.) By contrast, a ""non-RadioShack-branded product"" is ""a product not produced by RadioShack 
and bearing some name other than RadioShack on the label and packaging, for instance, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, or 
Everready."" (See id.) "
1356,5," Because the RadioShack trademark cannot be said to identify products sold in RadioShack stores ""bearing some name other 
than RadioShack on the label and packaging, for instance, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, or Everready,"" ( see id.), the instant case 
is distinguishable from cases cited by RadioShack in which the product at issue was manufactured by a third party, but sold 
under the defendant's trademark, not under the trademark of the manufacturer. See, e.g., Krehl, 664 F.2d at 1354 n.14 (ice 
cream sold under Baskin-Robbins trademark but not manufactured by Baskin-Robbins); Power Test Petroleum Distributors, Inc. 
v. Calcu Gas, 754 F.2d 91, 98 (2nd Cir. 1985) (gasoline sold under PowerTest trademark but not manufactured by PowerTest); 
Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v. Morton Building, Inc., 737 F.2d 698, 704 (7th Cir. 1984) (prefabricated building sold under Morton 
trademark although all components not manufactured by Morton). "
1359,6," The Cartwright Act similarly confers standing on ""any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by [the Cartwright Act], regardless whether such injured person deals directly or 
indirectly with the defendant."" See In re Napster, Inc. Copyright Litigation, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1113, 1125 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (citing, 
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยง 16750(a).) As Strawflower correctly notes, the definition of ""antitrust injury"" under California law is less 
restrictive than the federal standard, in that California law expressly confers antitrust standing on persons who are injured 
indirectly by the defendant's anticompetitive conduct. See id. As Strawflower alleges that it was injured directly by RadioShack, 
however, the difference appears immaterial for purposes of the instant motion, and no party argues to the contrary. "
1370,1," Plaintiff makes much of the fact that, in the discussions leading up to the approval of the CBA, HERE notated a draft of the 
document with the language ""Proposal to Apply to Current DBE's"" appended to this section. Pltf Exh. 25, p. UNION 000241. The 
union makes much of the fact that the proposed language was ultimately withdrawn and does not appear in the final language. "

1379,6," The ILA cases involved a situation where a new technology -- the use of stackable shipping containers -- had obviated the 
need for the traditionally union-performed service of loading and unloading cargo from ships. The Supreme Court upheld the 
right of the union to recapture through CBAs the work lost through the advent of the containers, even though container 
loading/unloading had never been performed by union labor. "
1381,7," From contemporaneous notes taken by a union official during negotiations between Host and HERE, union official Sawyer is

1393,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that HN1[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15(a) (emphasis 
added). Illinois Brick determined that HN2[
] direct purchasers are the only parties ""injured"" in a manner that permits them to 
recover damages. 431 U.S. at 729, 735. It thus held that indirect purchaser plaintiffs do not have statutory standing to recover 
damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Id. "
1395,3," We note that the Government has also sued Dentsply for alleged antitrust violations. See United States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 
399 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2005). There we reversed the District Court's judgment in favor of Dentsply and granted injunctive relief. In 
so doing, we determined that Dentsply had monopoly power (i.e., the power to exclude competitors) and that its exclusionary 
practices, particularly Dealer Criterion Number 6, had an anticompetitive effect. Id. at 188-97. "
1397,4," Even if Plaintiffs had not sued the dealers, Dentsply may not be able to enforce the stipulations in any event. The stipulations 
state that ""Dentsply is a third party beneficiary of this stipulation"" and that the stipulations ""may be specifically enforced by the 
parties hereto or by Dentsply."" However, HN7[
] ""only intended beneficiaries of a contract made between two or more other 
parties have enforceable rights under the contract."" 13 Williston on Contracts ยง 37:8, at 67 (Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 2000) 
(citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 302). In this case, the contracting parties arguably did not intend that Dentsply 
benefit from the stipulations, as their purpose was to allow Plaintiffs to sue Dentsply. "
1399,5," If Dentsply's exclusionary conduct enabled it to raise its prices, thereby reducing (at least in theory) the demand for its own 
products, Plaintiffs might also have claimed lost profits damages caused by their lost opportunities to purchase and resell 
Dentsply's products. However, we would reject such a claim for the same reasons we reject Plaintiffs' claim for lost profits 
damages caused by their lost opportunities to purchase and resell Dentsply's competitors' products."
1399,6," Members of the distribution chain usually mitigate this harm by passing on some of the overcharge to their buyers. However, 
much of this harm is not actually avoided, but rather takes the form of the second type of harm--lost profits from the lost 
opportunity to buy and resell a greater volume of goods. This is because, as members of the distribution chain pass on the 
overcharge (i.e., raise their prices), their volume of sales theoretically decreases. Like the second type of harm, the overcharge paid minus the overcharge passed on for goods actually purchased and resold are 
a form of ""lost profits."" The overcharge paid minus the overcharge passed on for goods actually purchased and resold is one 
component of the loss an antitrust violation causes to the bottom line (i.e., the profits) of members of the distribution chain. 
However, because Illinois Brick precludes indirect purchasers from recovering overcharge damages, Plaintiffs do not seek in 
their lost profits claim the component of their lost profits that includes the overcharge paid minus the overcharge passed on for 
teeth they actually purchased and resold."
1399,7," We note that Professor Areeda, who gained recognition for his scholarly work in antitrust law, is deceased, and that the 
treatise is now the responsibility principally of Professor Hovenkamp. "
1401,8," Plaintiffs may not recover from Dentsply for teeth purchased from the two non-joined dealers under a coconspirator exception 
to Illinois Brick because, as previously mentioned, HN14[
] our Court has expressly refused to adopt a coconspirator exception 
when the alleged co-conspirators immediately upstream have not been joined. "
1402,9," ""Resale price maintenance""--the term used by Areeda et al.--is simply another way of describing the vertical price fixing in 
which Plaintiffs allege Dentsply and its dealers engaged. In resale price maintenance, the initial seller dictates the dealers' resale 
price."
1402,10," In fact, Areeda implies that even the alleged exclusive-dealing could not have caused the dealers to be overcharged. 2 Areeda 
et al., supra, P 346a, at 88 n.1 (2003 Supp.). This appears to be incorrect, for if the exclusive-dealing led to exclusion of 
Dentsply's competitors, Dentsply may have been able to overcharge its dealers."
1402,11," We are, of course, not saying that the dealers could prevail on any particular claim. Rather, we merely point out that if the 
dealers proved that Dentsply imposed resale price maintenance on them, their measure of damages would be based on the lost 
profits from their decreased volume of purchases and resales. This lost profits harm is different from, and thus not duplicative of, 
the overcharge harm that any resale price maintenance would have caused Plaintiffs. "
1403,12," We recognize that one might ask why would it not always be unprofitable for a direct purchaser to join such a non-RPM 
conspiracy and effectively agree to be overcharged (as input costs increase, profits decrease). Further, if economics predicts 
that such overcharge conspiracies will never arise, why consider adopting an exception for them? As an initial matter, because Jersey Dental is at the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) stage, we must take as true 
Plaintiffs' allegations that Dentsply and its dealers have conspired to fix, and have fixed, the prices that dealers charge Plaintiffs 
and that there was an exclusive-dealing conspiracy between Dentsply and its dealers to exclude Dentsply's competitors. We 
may not dismiss Plaintiffs' claims because we determine the alleged facts likely did not occur. In fact, however, we can imagine how the exclusive-dealing conspiracy, in combination with the RPM conspiracy, could have 
been profitable to the dealers. As previously mentioned, it would presumably not have been profitable for the dealers to have 
joined a conspiracy in which they were overcharged (the exclusive-dealing conspiracy). However, the dealers might have joined 
such a conspiracy if they were compensated in some fashion. Plaintiffs argue that Dentsply conspired to fix the prices that its 
dealers charge. This is effectively a horizontal price fixing conspiracy at the dealer level (which could presumably be profitable to 
the dealers) that is policed by Dentsply. Thus, the RPM conspiracy could be the mechanism by which Dentsply compensates its 
dealers in exchange for the dealers' agreement (1) not to deal with Dentsply's competitors and (2) thus to be overcharged by 
Dentsply. In addition, in Prescription Drugs Judge Posner rejected a similar argument that it would not have made sense economically for 
the wholesalers in that case to have joined what was arguably a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy at the manufacturer level. 123 
F.3d at 614. He explained that ""the theory is that the wholesalers were the manufacturers' cats-paws. There is nothing new 
about the idea that a cartel might 'hire' a customer to help police the cartel."" Id. He also implied that, because drug wholesalers 
appeared to be ""an endangered commercial species"" and the manufacturers could have cut them out altogether and sold 
directly to buying groups for pharmacies, it was in the wholesalers' self-interest to join the conspiracy. Id. Finally, HN17[
] ""summary judgment for a defendant is proper, even if there is some evidence of an antitrust violation, if 
plaintiff's theory of violation makes no economic sense."" Prescription Drugs, 123 F.3d at 614 (citing Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986); Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical 
Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 467-69, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992)). Thus, there is already a mechanism in place 
for courts to dismiss before trial claims of a conspiracy that would make no economic sense."
1403,13," The Seventh Circuit is the only Court of Appeals to engage head-on the general co-conspirator exception, and it has adopted 
it. See Paper Systems, 281 F.3d at 631-32 (""The right to sue middlemen that joined the conspiracy is sometimes referred to as a "
1404,," co-conspirator 'exception' to Illinois Brick, but it would be better to recognize that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick allocate to the 
first non-conspirator in the distribution chain the right to collect 100 of the damages.""); Prescription Drugs,123 F.3d at 604; 
Fontana Aviation, 617 F.2d at 481. However, we do not discern an explanation by the Court why it did so or an explicit 
delineation of the exception's scope (i.e., whether it is unlimited or limited)."
1404,14," Because Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides for damages of treble the amount a plaintiff is injured, presumably indirect 
purchaser plaintiffs would only be permitted to recover treble the amount of the manufacturer's overcharge that the direct 
purchasers passed on to them and would not be able to recover the portion of the manufacturer's overcharge that the direct 
purchasers absorbed because the indirect purchasers would not have been injured by that portion. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 15(a) 
(Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."") (emphasis added). But see Paper 
Systems, 281 F.3d at 631-32 (""The right to sue middlemen that joined the conspiracy is sometimes referred to as a co-
conspirator ""exception"" to Illinois Brick, but it would be better to recognize that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick allocate to the 
first non-conspirator in the distribution chain the right to collect 100 of the damages."") (emphasis added); cf. Hanover Shoe, 392 
U.S. at 494 (holding that an antitrust defendant could not argue that a plaintiff who had purchased a product directly from the 
defendant was not injured because it had passed on the illegal overcharge to its own customers, thus creating a regime under 
which plaintiffs can arguably recover more than ""threefold the damages by him sustained""). Of course, if under the limited 
exception (where direct purchasers are barred from recovering) indirect purchaser plaintiffs were allowed to recover the entire 
overcharge that the manufacturers imposed on the direct purchasers (even though the direct purchasers absorbed some of that 
overcharge and did not pass on that absorbed portion to the indirect purchasers), then the portion of the overcharge that was 
passed on from the direct purchasers to the indirect purchasers would not need to be ascertained and Illinois Brick's second 
policy justification would cut in favor of the limited exception."
1404,15," Technically speaking, there would be no need to ""apportion"" damages between direct and indirect purchasers under the 
limited exception. This is because, as we have explained, the limited exception would only permit indirect purchaser standing in 
circumstances where the direct purchaser would be barred from bringing suit against the manufacturer. As such, there would be 
no need to apportion any damages to the direct purchasing middleman. Nevertheless, even under the limited exception, the finder of fact would be required to ascertain the amount of the overcharge 
that had been passed on by the middleman. After all, HN18[
] an antitrust plaintiff (whether he be a direct or an indirect purchaser) is only entitled to recover ""threefold the damages by him sustained."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15(a) (emphasis added). Therefore, 
to the extent that the middleman retained (i.e., did not pass on to the indirect purchaser) a portion of any overcharge imposed 
upon him, the damages actually sustained by the indirect purchaser would be reduced by that amount. "
1405,16," The Court explained that, ""although in pari delicto literally means 'of equal fault,' the doctrine has been applied . . . in a wide 
variety of situations in which a plaintiff seeking damages or equitable relief is himself involved in some of the same sort of wrong 
doing."" Perma Life, 392 U.S. at 138."
1405,17," See Perma Life, 392 U.S. at 146 (White, J., concurring) (""I would deny recovery where plaintiff and defendant bear 
substantially equal responsibility for injury resulting to one of [the co-conspirators] . . . .""); id. at 147 (Fortas, J., concurring) (Suit 
should be barred when ""the fault of the parties is reasonably within the same scale.""); id. at 149 (Marshall, J., concurring) (""I 
would hold that where a defendant in a private antitrust suit can show that the plaintiff actively participated in the formation and 
implementation of an illegal scheme, and is substantially equally at fault, the plaintiff should be barred from imposing liability on 
the defendant.""); id. at 153 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (Stewart, J., joining) (""Properly used[, in pari

1406,18," See 2 Areeda et al., supra, P 346k, at 378 (""The obvious difficulty with denying damages for consumers buying from an 
intermediary is that they are injured, often more than the intermediary, who may also be injured but for whom the entire 
overcharge is a windfall. The indirect purchaser rule awards greatly overcompensate intermediaries and greatly 
undercompensate consumers in the name of efficiency in the administration of the antitrust laws.""). "
1407,19," Plaintiffs also allege in Jersey Dental that--as to teeth Dentsply drop shipped to them--they were direct purchasers not subject 
to Illinois Brick. Further, the Jersey Dental complaint does not have the Hess complaint's defect, as it specifically alleges that 
Plaintiffs were direct purchasers. As we hold that the Jersey Dental Plaintiffs have standing to recover damages from Dentsply 
for its alleged price-fixing conspiracy with its dealers under the co-conspirator exception to Illinois Brick, Plaintiffs may potentially 
recover on the drop-shipped teeth under that theory. Finally, as in Hess, Plaintiffs in Jersey Dental do not come within the control exception to Illinois Brick because, as already 
noted, Dentsply does not own any interest in its dealers, there is no functional unity among Dentsply and its dealers, and all of 
Illinois Brick's policy reasons for denying standing apply. "
