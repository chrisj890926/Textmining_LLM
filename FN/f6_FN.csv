28,1," The Court will not state the extensive factual background of this case here. Instead, the Court incorporates by reference the 
factual background as outlined in this Court's May 9, 2005 Order (Doc. No. 363)."
28,2," Several Defendants, USA Equestrian Trust, Inc., f/k/a USA Equestrian, Inc. (""USAE"")(formerly The American Horse Shows 
Association, Inc.(""AHSA"")), Bob Bell, Classic Company Ltd., Kernan Hodges a/k/a Mrs. George H. Hodges, Jr. and North Florida 
Hunter & Jumper Association, Inc. apparently settled with the Plaintiffs and were dismissed from the case (Doc. Nos. 195, 261, 
267 and 350)."
28,3," The Court notes that as to Plaintiff Gallagher, the Court granted without prejudice the Burton Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the 
First Amended Complaint since Plaintiff Gallagher did not allege compliance with ""the Federation procedures and did not plead 
he sought a waiver of the Mileage Rule from the Burton Defendants"" (Doc. No. 59). "
29,4," The Mileage Rule provides, in part, that in all States other than Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, 
New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, horse shows offering ""A"" rated hunter and jumper events must be held at least 250 
miles apart on the same date. The Mileage Rule may be waived by a conflicting horse show promoter."
29,5," The Court notes that the Fox Lea Defendants fail to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to 
attorneys' fees under the Florida Antitrust Act. Likewise, the Fox Lea Defendants fail to provide any arguments or citation of 
authorities with respect to their entitlement to attorneys' fees pursuant to the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
Rather, they request this Court reserve ruling on their entitlement to an award of attorneys' fees as the prevailing party under the 
Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act until all appeals have been exhausted."
29,6," Defendant USEF states ""the additional cost entitlement reference in this Motion would simply be costs allowed under the 
Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, if any, above and beyond those provided by federal law."" Defendant USEF 
fails to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs under the Florida Deceptive 
and Unfair Trade Practices Act or their entitlement to attorneys' fees under the Florida Antitrust Act."
29,7," The Burton Defendants fail to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs 
under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act or their entitlement to attorneys' fees under the Florida Antitrust Act."
29,8," The Stadium Jumping Defendants fail to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to attorneys' fees 
and costs under the Florida Antitrust Act."
29,9," The HITS Defendants fail to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to attorneys' fees under the 
Florida Antitrust Act. Likewise, the HITS Defendants fail to provide any citation of authorities with respect to their entitlement to "
30,," attorneys' fees pursuant to the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Rather, they request this Court reserve ruling 
on their entitlement to an award of attorneys' fees as the prevailing party under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices 
Act until all appeals have been exhausted."
30,10," The Court notes that the Stadium Jumping Defendants subsequently refiled their Bill of Costs on June 8, 2005 (Doc. No. 379)."
30,11, Defendant USEF.
30,12," The Fox Lea Defendants contend that ""the facts of this case establish that no justiciable issue of fact or law ever existed"" with 
respect to them. However, the Court notes that the Fox Lea Defendants did not file dispositive motions and their motion for 
attorneys' fees improperly attempts to introduce new facts for consideration by this Court. "
31,13," The Court notes that prior to 1994, the prevailing party in civil litigation brought under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair 
Practices Act was mandatorily entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the nonprevailing party. The 
Legislature amended § 501.2105 in 1994 to place an award of such fees and costs within the discretion of the trial court. See 
Hubbel v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 758 So.2d 94, 101 n.10 (Fla. 2000)(Lewis, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). "
32,14," Pursuant to the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26."
32,15," Counts V-VIII raised claims of violations of the Florida Antitrust Act, FLA. STAT. §§ 542.18 and 542.19. Count IX alleged 
violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. "
33,16, 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
33,17, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26. 
34,18," The Court notes that the discovery cutoff was eventually extended to December 31, 2004, with expert discovery not closing 
until February 28, 2005 (Doc. No. 254). "
35,19," $ 604.40 represents the amount of the second invoice, # 73507, for the transcripts of David O'Connor and John Long (Doc. 
No. 369). "
38,1," Providence has agreed to this fact, and some others, only for purposes of this motion and may take a different position at trial. "
55,1," Lovelock was added as a plaintiff in a second amended complaint filed on January 23, 2006. Lovelock did not submit a 
verification with the second amended complaint. Even assuming, however, that his allegations were verified, they do not show 
an entitlement to injunctive relief. "
57,2," Resolve, Marine Recovery and Salvage and Mayer will not be prejudiced by the Court's decision to consider the merits of 
plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief against them notwithstanding plaintiffs' failure to provide proof of service within the time 
specified by the Court. Resolve has had an opportunity to be heard, as it filed a brief in opposition to plaintiffs' claims. Although 
Marine Recovery and Salvage and Mayer have not responded, the Court finds that plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to 
injunctive relief against them in any event. "
60,3," Because this opinion addresses only plaintiffs' claims for forward-looking relief, the Court expresses no opinion on the merits of 
any constitutional claim relating to past policies or practices. "
70,1," HN10[
] The Ninth Circuit has found that exclusive dealing arrangements challenged under Section 1 are not per se violations and are evaluated under the rule of reason. See Twin City, 676 F.2d at 1304, n.9 (citing Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 327). 
Masimo has never contended that any of the alleged practices were per se illegal and therefore the appropriate legal analysis to 
use in evaluating the Section 1 claims is the rule of reason. "
71,2," HN12[
] The Ninth Circuit also has explained that it is easier to meet the threshold of foreclosure for a Section 3 violation than it is for a Section 1 violation. See id. at 1304, n.9 (""a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required to establish a Sherman 
Act violation than a [S]ection 3 Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases.""). "
72,3," The ability of hospitals under Sole Source contracts to terminate Market Share Discount agreements on short notice is 
discussed separately under the next subsection."
72,4," HN16[
] A Section 3 claim may be supported by less than 24% foreclosure. Id. at 1304 n.9. "
73,5," In ft. 9 on page 15 of the opposition, Plaintiff argues that Tyco had Sole Source agreements with VHA and UHC, Novation's 
predecessors. However, evidence introduced at trial, including cited exhibits, failed to demonstrate that members of VHA and 
UCS were required to purchase oximetry products from Tyco. "
95,1," Driving simulation systems imitate the operation of a vehicle, for training purposes, by using a simulated vehicle cab, instructor 
console, system operating software, and curriculum software. (Id. P16.) According to Doron, each application of a driving 
simulator (i.e., bus simulator, emergency vehicle simulator, law enforcement vehicle simulator) is so unique that it constitutes a 
separate and distinct market, with little or no cross-elasticity of demand. (Id. P18.)"
95,2," For purposes of Doron's federal and state antitrust claims, Doron defines the relevant product market as: ""The market for 
computer-aided driving simulators sold to public transit agencies for the purpose of training transit bus operators."" (Id. P18.)"
95,3," FAAC was to pay royalties to NYCTA in accordance with the following schedule: (1) 4% of the product price until total royalties 
equal $ 120,000, and (2) 2% of the product price after royalties equal $ 120,000 until royalties equal $ 240,000. (Buckingham 
Decl., Ex. A (NYCTA-FAAC Contract, clause 9).) This $ 240,000 in royalties, intended to provide NYCTA some return on its 
initial investment, was the only ""profit"" that NYCTA stood to gain from development of the bus simulator."
95,4," According to Doron, subsequent to entering into the contract, FAAC sold enough bus simulators to other transit agencies and 
municipalities to trigger its obligations to make royalty payments, but to date FAAC has not made any cash payments to NYCTA. 
(Am. Compl. P71.) Doron alleges that NYCTA may have exchanged some or all of its right to receive cash royalty payments for "
96,," a promise from FAAC to provide enhancements and upgrades to NYCTA's products. (Id. P72.) Therefore, while the original 
contract contemplated a ""profit-sharing partnership,"" it appears that NYCTA was merely a customer, which traded profits for 
credits towards enhancements and upgrades for which it would have otherwise had to pay additional sums."
96,5," Particularly, NYCTA staff would be made available to train other FAAC customers on how to use the product, to develop 
training curricula and driving scenarios to be used by other customers, and to participate in industry meetings on behalf of 
FAAC. (Id. P56.)"
96,6," In addition to submitting bid protests to the proper local and state authorities in each case, Doron submitted a bid protest to the 
Federal Transit Administration (""FTA"") challenging the Flint, Michigan RFP. On November 14, 2005, the FTA rendered a 
decision concluding that Flint's RFP was so specifically tailored to the FAAC simulator ""it was virtually impossible for anyone 
other than FAAC to bid,"" and therefore Flint's RFP ""violated the requirement for fair and open competition"" that comes with the 
grant of federal funds. (Pl.'s Suppl. Letter Brief, Ex. 1, at 1-2.) "
97,7," Doron admitted to this sale during the December 9, 2005 oral argument. (Oral Argument Tr. 37.) Doron also sold an interactive 
bus simulator to Go Transit, the transit authority for Toronto, Canada in September 2005, a fact that Doron admitted at oral 
argument. In its amended complaint, however, Doron defines the relevant geographic market to include only the United States. 
Given the fact-intensive nature of market definition, the Court will not analyze the propriety of Doron's geographic market on a 
pre-discovery motion to dismiss. See discussion infra page 8-9. Therefore, the Court will not consider this sale to a Canadian 
agency as affecting the relevant market and each company's share in it."
97,8," HN1[
] For purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court may take judicial notice of information publicly announced on a 
party's website, as long as the website's authenticity is not in dispute and ""it is capable of accurate and ready determination."" 
Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); see Town of Southold v. Town of E. Hampton, 406 F. Supp. 2d 227, 232 n.2 (E.D.N.Y 2005); Sarl Louis 
Feraud Int'l v. Viewfinder Inc., 406 F. Supp. 2d 274, 277 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). "
98,9," Defendant FAAC argues that Doron's amended complaint must be dismissed because Doron fails to allege proper product and 
geographic markets. (FAAC's Mem. Supp. Summ. J. 16-17.) FAAC contends that Doron's product market-the market for 
""computer-aided bus-driving simulators sold to public authorities""-is incorrect because other forms of driver training (e.g., test 
courses, safety films, driving schools) are reasonable substitutes for ""computer-aided driving simulators,"" and therefore should 
be included in the relevant product market. (Id. at 16.) FAAC also contends that Doron's geographic market-the United States-is 
incorrect, given that Doron sells its simulators in approximately 30 countries worldwide. (Id. at 17.) While FAAC makes a strong 
point, its arguments only highlight the deeply factintensive nature of market definition. Given the unique features of computer-
aided simulators, such as the ability to simulate various driving conditions without ever subjecting the trainee to the open road, it 
is completely plausible that computer-aided driving simulators are a separate market with little, or no, cross-elasticity of demand. 
Similarly, given that traffic laws and driving culture vary from country to country, it is plausible that the United States is a 
separate geographic market with respect to bussimulator products. "
99,10," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes illegal any monopoly, attempt to monopolize, or conspiracy to monopolize interstate trade 
or commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 2. Section 2 is limited, however, to monopolies attempted or obtained through ""willful acquisition or 
maintenance"" (i.e., through exclusionary means), as opposed to monopolies achieved by natural growth and the development of 
a superior product. See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). Because 
both Sections 1 and 2 require a similar showing of anticompetitive conduct (i.e., ""a concerted attempted to reduce output and "
100,," drive up prices or otherwise reduce consumer welfare,"" Davray, Inc. v. City of Midlothian, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41520, No. 04 
Civ. 539, 2005 WL 1586574, at *13 (N.D. Tex. 2005)), the Court will analyze both claims together, rather than attempting 
separate (and repetitive) analyses under Section 1 and Section 2."
100,11," Competitive bidding laws prescribe a series of procedural rituals (preliminary analysis, scoping sessions, interim reviews, 
requests for proposals, scoring of responses, etc.) intended to eliminate corruption in the awarding of public contracts. These 
procedures are designed to, and in fact do, minimize managerial discretion. The focus of bidding laws is solely on the lowest-
cost responsible bidder; other critical factors, such as quality, timeliness, reliability, productivity and predictability are downplayed 
or ignored. In this sense, the public bidding process restricts competition. Many have even suggested that the public competitive 
bidding process adds needless cost and reduces quality. See Philip K. Howard, The Death of Common Sense. 57 passim 
(1994). It is significant that when state and local governments want something done well and promptly, competitive bidding is 
eliminated. See id.; see also New York City's and State's response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. Even more 
significant, the public bidding process is not followed at all in the private sector. Thus, ""competitive"" bidding has nothing to do 
with promoting quality or choice. It is simply an anticorruption device. The antitrust laws, on the other hand, promote ""competition"" for the best product, by protecting the free choice of the consumer 
from restrictions imposed by the seller. Thus, the policies and goals of public bidding laws and antitrust laws are completely 
different, in a sense even diametrically opposed--while the crux of the antitrust laws is to foster consumer choice, the public 
bidding laws sacrifice consumer choice to protect the public trust. What Doron has done in this case is treat the notion of ""competition"" in both public bidding and antitrust laws as identical, in an 
attempt to establish that violation of ""competition"" in bidding must automatically constitute a violation of ""competition"" under the 
Sherman Act. In fact, at oral argument Doron stated: ""There is an antitrust violation if there is a pattern or practice by the private 
company to deceptively cause [the public agencies] to break their own procurement laws."" (Oral Argument Tr. 41-42.) This is 
simply wrong. Despite Doron's urgings to the contrary, the Court rejects the proposition that a violation of the public bidding laws 
constitutes a per se violation of antitrust laws. "
103,12," In fact, Security Fire Door, perhaps the first case to directly hold that a violation of competitive bidding laws does not constitute 
a violation of the Sherman Act, dismissed plaintiff's antitrust claims on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Security Fire Door, 
484 F.2d at 1029-30."
103,13," For purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court will limit applicability of the Parker doctrine to the original February 1999 
Contract to develop the new simulator. The NYCTA enabling statutes gives NYCTA the authority to take all steps necessary to 
provide safe and efficient public transit in the New York City metropolitan area. The Court is certain that this mandate includes 
the authority to enter into contracts to develop new training products, and that this conduct was perfectly foreseeable to the State 
legislature. The Court need not decide whether this mandate includes the authority to act as a distributor or sales representative 
supporting FAAC's sales to other public transit authorities. "
104,14," Under existing Second Circuit precedent, the Court's conclusion that NYCTA is immune from antitrust liability under the Parker 
doctrine ""also compels the conclusion that [FAAC] is shielded from antitrust liability,"" since subjecting FAAC to antitrust liability 
when NYCTA is immune ""would effectively block [NYCTA's] efforts to carry out its mandate through contracts with private 
parties."" Automated Salvage Transp., Inc. v. Wheelabrator Envtl. Sys., Inc., 155 F.3d 59, 74 (1998); see also Cine 42nd St., 709 
F.2d at 1048 (noting that ""allowing tangential attacks on the [protected public entity's] activities through suits against the third 
parties [cooperating with it] would effectively block the efforts of the [protected body]""). "
105,15," While Doron cites other cases, none of them are directly applicable to this case. Some of these cases are distinguishable on 
the facts of this case, as they involved private defendants who rigged or influenced the bidding process through conduct that 
was itself illegal. See, e.g., F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. v. Seawright, 595 F. Supp. 422, 425-26 (N.D. Ohio 1984) (finding liability 
where defendants conspired to rig the bidding process); Richard Hoffman Corp. v. Integrated Bldg. Sys., Inc., 581 F. Supp. 367, 
374 (N.D. Ill 1984) (finding that plaintiff adequately alleged anticompetitive conduct where private firm had prepared bid 
specifications and written in its own product, thereby denying the public agency independent judgment in its choice of product). Other cases are simply not relevant. For example, while the court in Fremaux v. Bd. of Com'r of Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 3, did, as 
Plaintiff claims, deny Noerr-Pennington immunity to a doctor who used the competitive bidding process to obtain an exclusive 
contract with a state hospital, see 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4098, 1997-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P71,852, 1997 WL 159483, at *5 (E.D. 
La. 1997), Fremaux appears limited to the hospital context, and was implicitly overruled by the Fifth Circuit in Surgical Care Ctr. 
v. Hospital Serv. Dist. No. 1, 153 F.3d 220, 225 (5th Cir. 1998), which held that the private defendant, a private medical center, 
was entitled to the same immunity as the state hospital defendant. In Surgical Care Center of Hammond, the Fifth Circuit based 
its grant of immunity to the private defendant on Parker v. Brown and its progeny, not on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, but the 
decision appears to have the same effect as if Noerr-Pennington immunity was applied to the private defendants. See Surgical 
Care Ctr., 153 F.3d at 225. It is also important to note that, after denying Noerr-Pennington immunity to the defendant doctor, the 
trial court in Fremaux found nothing anticompetitive about the doctor's conduct and therefore granted defendant's motion to "
106,," dismiss. See Fremaux, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4098, 1997 WL 159483 at *5-6 (""Plaintiff's unsuccessful direct participation in a 
competitive process can not be converted into an antitrust injury . . . .""). At oral argument, Doron also puts significant emphasis on Indian Head, Inc. v. Allied Tube & Conduit Corp., 817 F.2d 938 (2d 
Cir. 1987). (Oral Argument Tr. 39-40). Its reliance on this case is misinformed, however, as Indian Head merely says that Noerr-
Pennington immunity does not extend to lobbying of a private organization acting as a ""quasi-legislative"" body. See 817 F.2d at 
943. The Court's concern in that case was the fact that the rule-making body was not actually a public entity. Id. That is not the 
case here."
106,16," The Second Circuit has not yet ruled on this issue. See Triple M Roofing, 753 F.2d at 248 n.4."
106,17," Supreme Court precedent has extremely limited the sham exception, holding that the exception applies only where a 
defendant's activities ""are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action at all,"" Omni Outdoor, 499 U.S. at 380 
(emphasis added), but really mask an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor."" See Prof'l 
Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60-61. The Court gives as a classic example a defendant who files ""frivolous objections to the "
107,," license application of a competitor, with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose expense 
and delay,"" Omni Outdoor, 499 U.S. at 380, or engages in ""objectively baseless"" litigation against a competitor. See Prof'l Real 
Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60-61 (1993); California Motor Transp., 404 U.S. at 512."
107,18," The Local Government Antitrust Act (""LGAA"") provides that ""no damages, interest on damages, costs or attorney's fees may 
be recovered from any local government"" for violations of the federal antitrust laws. 15 U.S.C. § 15. The term ""local government"" 
includes special function governmental units established by state law. 15 U.S.C. § 34. As a public benefit corporation of the state 
of New York, operating for the special purpose of maintaining a commuter transportation system within the geographic area of 
New York City, NYCTA is a ""special purpose governmental unit,"" and is therefore protected by the LGAA. See, e.g., Capital 
Freight Servs. Inc. v. Trailer Marine Transp., 704 F. Supp. 1190 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (finding the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping 
Authority, a public corporation created for the express purpose of maintaining a maritime transportation system for the people of 
Puerto Rico, was a ""public function governmental unit"" under the LGAA). Therefore, even if the Court found that Defendants had 
violated the Sherman Act, under no circumstances could Doron recover monetary damages from NYCTA for its violation of 
these laws. "
111,1, GPOs distribute manufactured endo-mechanical products to hospitals. 
121,1," Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike Halcor, S.A.'s Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on July 25, 
2005 pursuant to Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
121,2," The Bankrupt Estate of Smith and Wofford Plumbing and Industrial Supply, Inc. was plaintiff in Civil Action No. 04-2930-DV 
prior to the consolidation of the case of American Copper & Brass, Inc. v. Boliden AB, et [*7]  al., Civil Action No. 04-2771-DV. "
130,1," The City of Stockton also filed a related preliminary injunction motion. It was denied on September 26, 2005. "
131,2," A third smaller company, A-One, also was party to the MOU. However, A-One went out of business in 2004 and is not a party 
to this action. (AMR Mot. at 5.)"
131,3," According to the joint status report that was filed while these motions were under submission, AMR was the successful bidder."
131,4, AMR also styles its motion as a motion for declaratory judgment as to section 4 of the JVA. 
133,5," AMR argues that without integration and economic efficiencies, a joint venture cannot exist. It cites the Federal Trade 
Commission and Department of Justice-Antitrust Guidelines for support, specifically the section describing agreements that are 
analyzed as illegal per se. Fed. Trade Comm'n & Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors, § 
3.2, 2000 WL 33534553 at *7 (2000). The Guidelines describe a legitimate joint venture as an ""efficiency-enhancing integration,"" 
which involves collaboration among the participants that benefits or will potentially benefit consumers. Id. Indicators of such 
integration ""typically"" include the combination of ""significant capital, technology, or other complementary assets to achieve 
procompetitive benefits"" not achievable by the parties on their own. Id. AMR's reliance on the Guidelines is misplaced. First, 
whether or not a joint venture exists is a question of state law. Nelson v. Serwold, 687 F.2d 278, 282 (9th Cir. 1982). Second, the 
Guidelines are ""intended to explain how the Agencies analyze certain antitrust issues"" and are not controlling authority. Finally, 
as noted above, even if the Guidelines apply, a question of fact remains as to whether the parties intended eventual integration. 
See Earl W. Kinter, Federal Antitrust Laws § 11.32 (2002) (""Joint ventures may take many forms, with varying objectives and 
varying degrees of integration."")."
133,6," Section 2(b)(i) of the JVA (alleged emergency service market allocation) provides: The implementation schedule of 9-1-1 dedicated emergency ambulances specifically within areas known as the [Stockton 
Zone] by [the City], AMR, and A-One will be as follows: (i) Initially and continuing, [the City] and AMR shall each place into 
service an equal and even number of ALS ambulance units. A-One shall place one ALS ambulance into service. (ii) Any 
additional increase in emergency ambulance resource needs shall be alternated between the three parties for 
implementation with [the City] having the first right of refusal, AMR having the second and A-One having the third. Section 1 of the JVA (alleged non-emergency service market allocation) provides: Except as set forth below, the response to the RFP will allow each signatory to provide non-emergency ambulance 
transportation within their own zones. AMR and A-One will be exclusively responsible for non-emergency interfacility 
transfers, critical care transfers, long distance transfers, scheduled wait and returns and HMO/PPO contractual 
agreements. Welch Decl. Ex. 10. "
134,7," For similar reasons, AMR's reliance on In Re B&J School Bus Serv., Inc., 116 F.T.C. 308 (April 22, 1993) (FTC File No. 
9010172), is misplaced. In B&J, the four major competitors in the market combined to bid, won the bid, and performed the 
awarded contract for many years. Their performance under that contract did not result in any change to their business practices; 
they did not combine resources, change service areas, or integrate operations. Here, the parties never submitted a joint bid and, 
therefore, never performed under a contract. Therefore, the court has no similar evidence of anticompetitive effect before it. "
135,8," AMR also cites to a group of cases holding that bid-rigging is per se illegal. See, e.g., Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists 
Communications, 909 F.2d 1245, 1253 (9th Cir. 1990) (agreement between movie exhibitors to split the market for movie license 
amongst themselves, to the exclusion of other exhibitors, per se illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act). However, while the cases 
relied upon by AMR involve a party's ultimate exclusion from bidding, they are distinguishable from the facts currently at issue 
here. The cases involve parties colluding to eliminate bidding competition where both of the parties involved in the collusion 
benefit from that scheme. AMR has not alleged that it and the City engaged in such collusion. Also, both parties could not 
simultaneously benefit from the implementation of section 4. By definition, if one of the parties walked away, it could not bid at all 
and, therefore, could not provide ambulance services in the Stockton Zone. "
140,1," DCS argues that three judges of the Southern District of Texas have adopted the ""essential facilities doctrine."" It is more 
accurate to say that these judges addressed the doctrine in their opinions, since none of the three found that the requirements of 
the doctrine had been met in each of their cases. Aldridge, 995 F.Supp. 728; City of College Station, Texas v. City of Bryan, 
Texas, 932 F.Supp. 877 (S.D. Tex. 1996) (Atlas, J.); TCA Building Company v. Northwestern Resources Co., 873 F.Supp. 29 
(S.D. Tex. 1995) (Kent, J.)."
140,2," Cf. Judge Atlas's opinion in City of College Station, 932 F. Supp. at 887 (S.D.Tex. 1996)"
140,3," Cf. Judge Lake's opinion in Aldridge, 995 F. Supp. at 752, n.138. "
141,4, Id. 
165,1," The issue of ""choice of circuit"" law overturned Federal Circuit precedent and that portion of the opinion was therefore decided 
en banc. "
166,2," The '732 patent issued from an application which was a continuation-in-part of the 07/839,016 application, which was in turn a 
continuation of the 07/717,155 application. "
170,3," See supra Part I.A of this opinion addressing MGP's allegations of fraudulent procurement of the Par Patents. MGP also 
asserts that if the conduct does not amount to fraud, the conduct meets the less stringent definition of inequitable conduct.

] A finding of inequitable conduct renders a patent unenforceable. See, e.g., Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Johnson & Johnson Orthopaedics, Inc., 976 F.2d 1559, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (inequitable conduct does not invalidate a patent but renders 
the patent unenforceable). "
180,1," HN1[
] The Sherman Act prohibits ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
180,2," The Clayton Act provides in relevant part: HN2[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a 
sale or contract for sale of goods, [etc.,] . . . on the condition, agreement or understanding that the . . . purchaser thereof 
shall not use or deal in the goods . . . of a competitor . . . where the effect of . . . such condition . . . may be to substantially 
lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
180,15, U.S.C. § 14.
180,3, Defendant CRA does not appear to join in DAI's motion for summary judgment. 
181,4," The Plaintiffs originally named RBS as a defendant in the present action, but the court dismissed their claims against it on May 
21, 1998. "
183,5," The Plaintiffs have also alleged that DAI and RBS engaged in a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act by requiring DAI's 
franchisees to purchase POS systems from RBS. HN7[
] To support such a claim, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate a 
combination or some form of concerted action between at least two legally distinct economic entities that constitutes an 
unreasonable restraint on interstate trade or commerce. See SubSolutions I, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 627 (citing Daniel, M.D. v. Am. 
Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. 112, 123 (W.D.N.Y. 1997)). Because this court concludes that DAI's exclusive-vendor 
policy was not an unreasonable restraint on trade, this antitrust conspiracy claim must also fail. "
185,6," As previously noted, one of the elements of the Second Circuit's five-prong test for an illegal tying arrangement is that the 
defendant exercised ""sufficient economic power in the tying product market to coerce purchaser acceptance of the tied product."" 
Hack, 237 F.3d at 86. Previously, in considering the Defendants' motion to dismiss, this court concluded that the Plaintiffs had 
not identified a relevant market for the tying product, that is, a market in which DAI could wield disproportionate power because 
of the low cross-elasticity of demand for other franchising opportunities. See SubSolutions I, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 624-25. In effect, 
the court held that the Plaintiffs had failed to allege facts showing that the demand for a Subway franchise was distinct from the 
demand for some other franchising opportunity. Nonetheless, this court found that the Plaintiffs could satisfy the ""sufficient 
economic power"" prong through an alternative test: the ""lock-in"" theory articulated in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical 
Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). "
186,7," HN11[
] To prevail under Connecticut law on a claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy, the Plaintiffs must 
prove the existence of a business relationship, DAI's knowledge of the relationship, intentional interference with the relationship, 
and consequential loss. SubSolutions I, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 628 (citing Chem-Tek, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 816 F. Supp. 123, 
130 (D. Conn. 1993))."
186,8," HN12[
] A practice is unfair under CUTPA if (1) without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, it offends 
public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise -- in other words, it is within at least the 
penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; or (2) it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, 
or unscrupulous; or (3) it causes substantial injury to consumers, competitors, or other businesspersons. See Ventres v. 
Goodspeed Airport, LLC, 275 Conn. 105, 155, 881 A.2d 937 (2005). All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a 
finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser 
extent it meets all three. See id. "
190,1," Defendants raised objections to the merits and methodology of Dr. Langenfeld's high incumbency opinion. For reasons 
expressed later in this decision, the Court finds it unnecessary to resolve those objections at this time. "
191,2," In his testimony, O'Brien stated that he was not an expert economist nor an expert in econometric modeling. See Transcript 
Filed February 21, 2006, at p. 54. "
192,3," Smaller counties may not be experience rated, and thus claims experience may not be relevant to one of the counties 
examined by O'Brien."
192,4," It is unclear whether O'Brien is a replacement expert for Mark Meade, an actuary whose expert testimony was essentially 
similar to that of O'Brien. If Gemplan is still proffering Meade as an expert, his testimony is subject to exclusion for the same 
reasons as O'Brien's. "
194,5," A lack of switching could be caused by many other factors than a boycott: ""A consumer may ignore a price increase 
occasioned by a collusive arrangement because the consumer is acting on instinct rather than on cold calculation. Second, for 
emotional or practical reasons, it may not be worth the bother for the consumer to seek out new sources of supply."" Harry Gerla, 
A Micro-Microeconomic Approach to Antitrust Law, 86 Mich. L. Rev. 892, 923 (April 1988). The condition (lack of switching) 
says nothing about whether its cause is a boycott or some other factor. Certainly there are cases where a condition reveals 
something about the cause. For example, a knife in the back raises a question of murder. Here, that does not apply. "
204,1," The Defendants have also moved to dismiss the RICO causes of action on other grounds, as well as the state law causes of 
action. Those motions have not been fully briefed for reasons discussed below, and therefore, are not considered here. Also, 
Defendants moved for transfer of venue, but have since withdrawn those Motions. (See Letter from Michael A. Freeman to the 
Court, Jan. 24, 2006; Letter from Richard Schaeffer to the Court, Jan. 23, 2006; Letter from Jonathan J. Lerner to the Court, Jan. 
20, 2006; Letter from Steven A. Marenberg to the Court, Jan. 19, 2006) "
208,2," The Complaint alleges fifteen counts. Not all counts are alleged against each Defendant. The specific allegations are as 
follows: . Count I (against all Defendants): Violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C.  §  1962(c). (Am. Compl. PP242-53); . Count II (against all Defendants): Conspiracy to Violate RICO, 18 U.S.C.  §  1962(d). (Am. Compl. PP254-58); . Count III (against all Defendants except Jakks H.K. and Road Champs): Violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  §  1. (Am. 
Compl. PP259-72); . Count IV (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, and Jakks): Declaratory Judgment as to whether the video game license and the 1998 
amendments to the toy license are void because they were formed as a result of commercial bribery in violation of New York 
law. (Am. Compl. PP273-80); . Count V (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, and Jakks): Declaratory Judgment as to whether the video game license and the 1998 
amendments to the toy license are void because of Shenker's and Bell's illegal acts and conflict of interest which was known to 
Jakks, in violation of New York law. (Am. Compl. PP281-95); . Count VI (against THQ/Jakks, Jakks, THQ, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.  
§  13(c). (Am. Compl. PP296-302); . Count VII (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Violation of the New York commercial bribery 
law. (Am. Compl. PP303-09); . Count VIII (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, Bennett, and Farrell): Fraudulent inducement in violation of 
New York law. (Am. Compl. PP310-17); . Count IX (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Unjust enrichment in violation of New York law. 
(Am. Compl. PP318-21); . Counts X and XI (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Inducing breach of fiduciary duty in 
violation of New York law. (Am. Compl. PP322-40); . Count XII (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Constructive trust under New York law. (Am. 
Compl. PP343-47); . Count XIII (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Tortious interference with contractual relations 
in violation of New York law. (Am. Compl. PP348-53); "
209,," . Count XIV (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, and Jakks): Piercing the corporate veil under New York law. (Am. Compl. PP354-58); . Count XV (against THQ, THQ/Jakks, Jakks, Friedman, Berman, and Bennett): Conspiracy to commit commercial bribery; 
fraudulent inducement; inducing breach of fiduciary duty; and tortious interference with contractual relations in violation of New 
York law. (Am. Compl. PP359-63)"
209,3," On September 1, 2005, Defendants James Bell and Bell Licensing, L.L.C. withdrew their Motions to Dismiss."
209,4," In addition to the enterprise argument, Defendants have also argued that Plaintiff's RICO claim should be dismissed for the 
following reasons: (1) failure to allege a threat of continued criminal activity (Jakks Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Am. 
Compl., 18-24 (""Jakks Mem."")); (2) failure to establish a pattern of racketeering activity (Jakks Mem. 24-27); (3) failure to allege 
a pecuniary injury to its business or property (Jakks Mem 29-31); (4) failure to seek enjoinment of future conduct (Jakks Mem. 
31-32); and (4) failure to properly plead the RICO predicate acts (Jakks Mem. 32-35). For the reasons stated earlier, the Court is 
only addressing the enterprise argument at this time. See supra Part I.C. "
211,5," In Errico, the panel upheld the RICO conviction of defendants whose enterprise was solely engaged in the fixing of horse 
races. See 635 F.2d at 156 (""A circle of jockeys -- including Amy and others -- who were joined through Errico with a circle of 
bettors … regularly attempted to profit and did profit from the illegal fixing of races. The two circles came together and continued 
to operate with that single, illegal purpose from at least August, 1974 through March 24, 1975. That community of interest and 
continuing core of personnel provides the 'group of individuals associated in fact' that is required for a RICO conviction.""). "
212,6," The Court does not cite or rely on the Circuit's unpublished opinion reversing the district court, as the Second Circuit's rules 
prohibit citation to the opinion. 2d Cir. R. 0.23. However, it remains true that the district court's dismissal of the complaint was 
reversed, even if the grounds are not precedent in this Circuit. It bears noting that the district court dismissed the RICO counts in 
the complaint solely on the basis that they failed to adequately plead the elements of enterprise (relying on the Eighth Circuit's "
213,," decisions in Stephens and Bledsoe). See Pavlov, 135 F. Supp. 2d at 429-31. Once the district court dismissed the RICO counts, 
it then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and also dismissed them for lack of diversity 
jurisdiction and on forum non conveniens grounds. Id. at 431-38."
213,7," The Court is bound to follow precedent even if it disagrees with it. See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S. Ct. 275, 
139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (""The Court of Appeals was correct in applying that principle [that lower courts are to follow binding 
precedent of the Supreme Court] despite disagreement with [that precedent] for it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule 
one of its precedents.""). Here, for example, there is much to be said for the view that RICO should not be used to bring a ""civil 
conspiracy claim,"" and that the ""criminal prohibition in § 1962(c) is not a mere super-conspiracy statute."" Bank, 2000 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 16180, 2000 WL 1692844, at *4. Until told otherwise by the Second Circuit, however, the Court can do little with this view 
in light ofMazzei. "
214,8," Nor is there anything in Coonan that suggests an implicit retreat from Mazzei. In fact, the panel in Coonan cited Mazzei and 
Bagaric for the notion that ""common sense suggests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily 
proven by 'what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.'"" 938 F.2d at 1560 (quoting Bagaric, 706 F.2d at 56 and 
citing Mazzei, 700 F.2d at 88-89). "
215,9," A practitioner has observed: Linguistically, Section 2(c) is a genuine piece of art. It has 115 words, all in one sentence. There are no semicolons, no 
clauses, just a few commas -- and there has even been a debate about whether the commas are in the right places. As you 
might expect in such a situation, no one has ever come forward to take full responsibility for its drafting. Mark L. Yeager, Developments -- 1984: Living with the Robinson-Patman Act, 53 Antitrust L.J. 1029 (1985). "
216,10," The diagram breaks down § 2(c) as follows: It is unlawful for any person to (1) pay (or receive) -- a. anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or b. any allowance or discount in lieu of brokerage, except for services rendered in connection with a sale or purchase of 
goods, (2) when the payment is made to (or by) a. the other party to the transaction, or b. an agent, representative or other intermediary where the intermediary is (i) acting for or in behalf of, or (ii) subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other than the person by whom compensation is 
paid. Blue Tree Hotels Inv. (Canada), Ltd., 369 F.3d at 218."
216,11," In Blue Tree, the district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed to allege any competitive injury 
from defendants' alleged conduct. 369 F.3d at 214. Though affirming dismissal of the complaint on the ground identified above, 
the Blue Tree court noted that the district court had erred in this conclusion, noting that to prevail on a claim under § 2(c), a 
plaintiff need only plead an antitrust injury. Id. at 219. "
218,12," In support of this point, the court cited to the Biddle court's quote from the legislative history, which Plaintiff relies upon as well. 
As discussed above, relying on that quote is misguided. Also, it bears noting that no other court has adopted the Ideal Plumbing 
court's interpretation of the quote from Biddle. "
219,13," This interpretation of §  2(c) is consistent with the common interpretation of other provisions of the RPA. For example, like §  
2(c), §  2(a) has also been interpreted to apply only to tangible goods. See Innomed Labs, LLC v. Alza Corp., 368 F.3d 148, 156 
(2d Cir. 2004) (construing ""commodities"" in § 2(a) strictly to mean only ""tangible products of trade""); Empire State Pharm. Soc., 
Inc., 778 F. Supp. at 1258 (declining to apply §  2(a) to insurance services contract)."
219,14," In 1979, three years after Abbott Labs, the Second Circuit, noting the ""strict view of the meaning of the term 'commodities'"" 
taken by other circuits, held that the sale of advertising was not a transaction involving ""commodities"" under § 2(a) of the RPA. 
Ambook Enters. v. Time Inc., 612 F.2d 604, 609-10 (2d Cir. 1979)."
219,15," For different reasons, the Fifth Circuit came to the same conclusion over sixty years ago. See Webb-Crawford, 109 F.2d at 
270 (""The punctuation as published is confusing. We think the true meaning is better indicated by taking the comma out after 
'thereof,' and inserting it after 'rendered.' Commas are not to be suffered to defeat the legislative meaning.""). "
220,16," Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of res judicata cannot be raised in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion unless all relevant facts 
are shown in the court's own record, of which the court can take judicial notice. (WWE Resp. 2) See Day v. Moscow, 955 F.2d 
807, 811 (2d Cir. 1992) (""Generally res judicata is an affirmative defense to be pleaded in the defendant's answer."") (citing Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 8(c)). Plaintiff asserts that the Shenker Defendants' submission of WWE's counterclaims in the Connecticut action and 
the Connecticut Order do not contain all relevant facts and are not in this Court's own record. (WWE Resp. 2; Tr. 125) However, 
the issue of res judicata is raised by the Amended Complaint because Plaintiff seeks to recover against the Shenker Defendants 
damages arising out of the same transaction alleged in Plaintiff's Connecticut cross-complaint. Cf. IHS Acquisition XV, Inc. v. 
Kings Harbor Care Center, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5448, No. 98 Civ. 7621, 1999 WL 223152, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 1999) 
(denying motion to dismiss based on affirmative defense of illegality where complaint did not raise the issue of illegality). 
Moreover, the Court properly can take judicial notice of the filings and the October 16, 2003 Order in the Connecticut state court 
action. See Green v. Warden, U.S. Penitentiary, 699 F.2d 364, 369 (7th Cir. 1983) (""Federal courts may also take notice of "
221,," proceedings in other courts, both within and outside of the federal judicial system, if the proceedings have a direct relation to 
matters at issue.""). The Connecticut filings present the allegations and the Connecticut Order outlines the judgement and the 
basis for the judgment in state court. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss is appropriate at this stage. See AmBase Corp., 326 F.3d 
at 72 (finding res judicata properly raised on a motion to dismiss where court took judicial notice of relevant facts in the record); 
Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152 F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir. 1998) (""An affirmative defense may be raised by a pre-answer 
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), without resort to summary judgment procedure, if the defense appears on the face of the 
complaint.""); Day, 955 F.2d at 811 (holding that res judicata may be raised in a pre-answer motion to dismiss). "
222,17," Plaintiff argues that Shenker cannot rely upon the doctrine of res judicata because he perjured himself and destroyed 
evidence in the Connecticut action, which precluded Plaintiff from pleading the RICO claim in that action. (WWE Resp. 3) The 
discussion above reveals that, despite Shenker's initial perjury, he was forced to ""come clean"" before the action was over and 
with sufficient time for WWE to add a RICO claim in that action. "
224,18," While the Court dismisses the RPA and Sherman Act claims, Plaintiff still may pursue the anti-trust claims, either through an 
appeal or by seeking leave to amend the Amended Complaint."
224,19," As discussed above, the Shenker Defendants intend to challenge WWE's claims at the damages hearing pursuant to 
Connecticut Practice Book §  17-34. Consequently, the damages hearing is not in the posture of an ordinary damages hearing. 
That said, the Connecticut case is significantly closer to conclusion than the federal case. "
225,20," The Shenker Defendants urge the Court to also consider whether WWE's federal claims are ""vexatious or reactive."" (Shenker 
Reply 8) The Supreme Court credited the suggestion that the purpose behind filing a second lawsuit could be useful in deciding 
whether to abstain. However, the Court did not adopt it as a factor. See Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 17 n.20. In any event, the Shenker Defendants argue that, because WWE has already obtained a default judgment in Connecticut, which 
entitles them to damages commensurate to what they could recover in federal court, WWE's subsequent federal suit must have 
been filed with a vexatious purpose. However, the default judgment in favor of WWE appears to have entitled WWE to little more 
than a delayed trial on the merits in the form of a damages hearing. See supra Part II.D.1. Additionally, although the RICO claim 
arose out of the same facts as WWE's cross-claims in Connecticut court, WWE has obtained additional facts (despite the 
Shenker Defendants' alleged attempts to conceal them), named additional Defendants, and added federal causes of action. 
Thus, there is nothing to suggest that WWE's federal suit was a ""reactive defensive maneuver … to delay the state proceeding 
and postpone final resolution of its dispute"" with the Shenker Defendants. Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Am. Mut. Reinsurance Co., 
600 F.2d 1228, 1234 (7th Cir. 1979)."
225,21," A comparison with a case where the court found that the balance of factors weighed in favor of abstention illustrates why 
abstention is inappropriate here. In Radioactive, J.V., 153 F. Supp. 2d at 476, the court noted, among other things, that 
California (where the state action was commenced) and New York (where the federal action was commenced) were sufficiently 
far from one another to render the federal forum inconvenient, that plaintiff's complaint in the federal action was identical to its 
cross-complaint in the state action and the state court had refused to dismiss the state action, that all of the claims in both 
actions were governed by state law, and that there was no reason to believe the state court could not adequately protect the 
plaintiff's interest. 153 F. Supp. 2d at 473-77. None of those considerations is present here. Thus, abstention is not appropriate 
here. "
229,22," Accord In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1165-66 (3rd Cir. 1993) (noting that the factors include: 
""'(1) the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to cause 
that harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; (2) whether the plaintiff's alleged injury is of the type for which the 
antitrust laws were intended to provide redress; (3) the directness of the injury, which addressed the concerns that liberal 
application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; (4) the existence of more direct victims of the alleged 
antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages.'"") (quoting Associated 
Gen. Contractors of California, Inc., 459 U.S. at 545); 2 Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp & Roger D. Blair, Antitrust Law 
P335a (2d ed. 2000) (""In addition to proving everything that would entitle the government to relief, the private plaintiff must also 
show (1) that the acts violating the antitrust laws caused … the private party plaintiff injury in fact to its business or property; (2) 
that this injury is not too remote or duplicative of the recovery of a more directly injured person; (3) that such injury is 'antitrust 
injury,' which is defined as the kind of injury that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful; and, in a damage case, (4) that the damages claimed or awarded measure such injury in a 
reasonably quantifiable way."" (quotations omitted)). "
230,23," The Parties have sacrificed a great number of trees in briefing the question of whether the alleged joint bid by THQ/Jacks is 
governed by the rule of reason or per se analysis (Jakks Sherman Act Mem. 21-27; WWE Sherman Act Resp. 17-24; Jakks 
Sherman Act Reply 3-8). Plaintiff argues strenuously that the joint bid by Jakks/THQ was part of a textbook bid-rigging scheme, 
which is a per se violation, while Jakks insists that the joint bid was lawful, under the rule of reason, as it was accepted by WWE 
knowing that it was a joint bid submitted by competitors. (Jakks Sherman Act Mem. 22-24; WWE Sherman Act Resp. 21-24; 
Jakks Sherman Act Reply 3-8) Resolution of this dispute, while potentially interesting, is unnecessary. See Sage Realty, 936 F. 
Supp. at 135 n.4 (granting motion to dismiss for failure to allege antitrust injury, even assuming plaintiffs' substantive antitrust 
allegations to be true)."
230,24," There even is authority for the proposition, contrary to Plaintiff's suggestion, that ""to satisfy the antitrust injury requirement, a 
plaintiff must show that 'the challenged action has had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market; 
to prove it has been harmed as an individual competitor will not suffice.'"" Sage Realty, 936 F. Supp. at 135 (quoting Capital 
Imaging Assocs., P. C. v. Mohawk Valley Med. Assocs., 996 F.2d 537, 543 (2d Cir. 1993)). Plaintiff attempts to distinguish 
Capital Imaging as a case involving an antitrust allegation governed by the rule of reason, however, the Supreme Court has 
made clear that ""the need for … showing [antitrust injury] is at least as great under the per se rule as under the rule of reason."" 
Atl. Richfield, 495 U.S. at 344. In any event, even if the Court assumes that Defendants' conduct had an actual adverse effect on 
competition, Plaintiff has failed to allege an antitrust injury from that adversely affected competition, or that Defendants' conduct 
was the cause of any antitrust injuries. "
232,25," Because Defendants did not rig all, or even close to all, of the bids available to WWE, this case is different from Philip Morris 
Inc. v. Heinrich, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9156, No. 95 Civ. 0328, 1996 WL 363156 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996). In that case, Philip 
Morris employed a formal bidding process where the purchasing department would secure one written bid and at least one 
alternative verbal price quotation. 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9156[WL] at *2. The defendants' scheme took advantage of this by 
ensuring that all competitors for contracts agreed to submit inflated bids to plaintiff, further agreeing that one company would be 
the lowest bidder and would subcontract the work out to the losing bidders. 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9156[WL] at *3. The winning 
bidder kept the difference between the legitimate bids and the inflated bids as a ""commission"" for its services, and paid some of 
the proceeds as kickbacks to two of the plaintiff's employees. Id. Unlike inPhilip Morris, the Defendants here did not engage in the same type of bid-rigging scheme, nor did they seek to include 
all would-be bidders in any such scheme. Therefore, the injury to Plaintiff here from any joint bid is far different from what it was 
there. Moreover, in this case, contrary to Plaintiff's efforts to spin otherwise, the crux of the Defendants' anti-competitive conduct 
is the bribery of the licensing agents and purchasers, with the joint bid being a means of promoting the success of that scheme. 
In Philip Morris, however, the bribery was the means of insuring success of the bid-rigging scheme. "
235,1," Additional facts are set forth in this Court's Opinion of October 28, 2004, denying defendants' motions to dismiss. In re: Bulk 
[Extruded] Graphite Products Antitrust Litigation, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29586 at *2, No. 02-6030 (D.N.J. October 28, 2004). "
241,2," ""Antitrust impact"" is sometimes referred to as ""fact of damage"" or ""fact of injury."""
241,3," Dr. John C. Beyer is President of Nathan Associates, an economic and financial consulting firm established in 1946. "
243,4, It is also worth noting that Dr. Beyer's analysis was used in both the Mercedes-Benz and Linerboard cases.
243,5," The electronic data produced by UCAR covers the period January 1990 through December 2001, and the electronic data 
produced by SGL covers the period January 1995 through December 2001. (Beyer Aff. at P27). "
244,6," The benchmark method determines benchmark prices for bulk extruded graphite before and after the conspiracy, and 
compares them to the prices during the conspiracy. Multiple regression analysis identifies the elements of the price attributable 
to normal market factors, such as supply, demand, and elements of price that cannot be explained as a result of such legitimate 
market factors and are, as a result, attributable to the price-fixing conspiracy. Both benchmark analysis and multiple regression 
analysis have been approved by the Third Circuit. Mercedes-Benz, 213 F.R.D. at 189-90; Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 151, 153-54. "
245,7," If, at a later time, it becomes apparent to the court that there are problems in proving damages that outweigh advantages of 
class certification, the Court can, at a later date, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4)(A) give appropriate consideration of a class 
limited to the determination of liability. See Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 456. "

249,1," Marine Recovery and Salvage also moved to dismiss the complaint for improper service of process. At oral argument on these 
motions, counsel for plaintiffs represented that plaintiffs had since properly served Marine Recovery and Salvage. Counsel for 
Marine Recovery and Salvage did not dispute that assertion. Accordingly, the motion is denied as moot."
249,2," At oral argument on the motions to dismiss, the parties disputed whether certain of defendants' alleged actions, such as the 
exclusivity arrangement with Marine Recovery and Salvage, were or were not properly authorized by the Levee District. 
Although plaintiffs argued that a number of actions were not properly authorized by the Levee District, their complaint 
nevertheless attributes those actions, for the most part, to the Levee District itself, rather than to individuals acting ultra vires. For 
the purposes of this motion, the Court will take the allegations contained in the complaint as true. "
251,3," At oral argument, counsel for the Levee District stated that the Levee District does not seek to dismiss plaintiffs' section 1983 
claim against it."

other vessel owners had the same standard-form lease agreement with the Levee District. (See Rec. Doc. 1 Ex. A, ¶ 4). "
271,1," Because of the proprietary nature of much of the information involved, we granted Premera's request to allow portions of the 
administrative record that were placed under seal to remain under seal during this appeal. We have reviewed the entire file,

Premera raises 17 assignments of error regarding a majority of the Commissioner's findings. We have organized these 
challenges into five major issues. "

] No person may enter into an agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a domestic insurer or 
person controlling a domestic insurer unless, at the time the offer, request, or invitation is made or the agreement is entered 
into, . . . the person has filed with the commissioner and has sent to the insurer, a statement containing the information 
required by this section and the offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition has been approved by the commissioner 
as prescribed in this section. For purposes of this section a domestic insurer includes a person controlling a domestic insurer unless the person, as 
determined by the commissioner, is either directly or through its affiliates primarily engaged in business other than the 
business of insurance."
277,10," Moreover, Premera's argument that the Insurer HCA does not apply is somewhat puzzling. In its petition for review, Premera 
asserted as follows: ""As Judge CASEY's Order states, two subsections of the Holding Company Acts--RCW 48.31B.015(4)(a) and 
RCW 48.31C.030(5)(a)-establish the criteria by which the Commissioner is required to evaluate Premera's Form A Statement."" 
Clerk's Papers at 8. In resolving a dispute concerning the timing of the Commissioner's decision, Thurston County Superior 
Court Judge PAULA CASEY issued an order stating, among other things, that review and approval of the Form A statement is 
governed by the criteria in chapter 48.31B RCW and chapter 48.31C RCW. Premera refers to this order as establishing the ""law 
of the case"" without reference to its position on appeal that the Insurer HCA does not apply. Br. of Pet'r's at 2. "
279,11," Furthermore, Premera's proposed findings of fact would have the Commissioner find that the proposed restrictions on the 
Foundations are appropriate and fully protective of the value of the stock the Foundations would hold. If the Commissioner has 
jurisdiction to approve the distribution of assets to the Foundations, he also has jurisdiction to reject them."

become for-profit.  Hawes v. Colo. Div. of Ins., 65 P.3d 1008, 1020 (Colo. 2003). That statute requires the insurance 
commissioner to specify a reasonable treatment of the value of the converting corporation for the citizens of Colorado. In doing 
so, the commissioner must ensure that the consideration to the qualifying charitable corporation equals the fair market value of 
the converting corporation.  Hawes, 65 P.3d at 1020 (citing Colo. Rev. Stat. § 10-16-324(4)(e)(I)(A)-(C)). Similarly, North 
Carolina has a conversion statute that creates ""a procedure for a medical, hospital, or dental service corporation to convert to a 
stock accident and health insurance company or stock life insurance company."" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-65-131(a) (2005). For any 
such conversion to occur, the conversion plan ""must provide a benefit to the people of North Carolina equal to one hundred 
percent (100) of the fair market value of the corporation."" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-65-131(a). In addition, Maryland has a conversion 
statute that requires its commissioner to ensure that ""the fair value of the public or charitable assets of a nonprofit health service 
plan or a health maintenance organization will be distributed to the Maryland Health Care Trust."" Md. Code Ann. § 6.5-
301(b)(3)(i) (2005)."
280,14," Premera also asserts that the Commissioner incorrectly assumed that the public owns its assets. The Commissioner entered 
no finding to that effect but did find that Premera is not owned by its directors, officers, or members and that no part of its income 
is distributable to those parties. In making this finding, he may have been guided by statements made by an OIC consultant, who 
stated that there was no ready answer to the question of who really owns Premera: To be sure, there are no identifiable owners analogous to those who hold that position in the case of for-profit companies. 
Nor can it be said, with reason, that the policyholders or insureds are PREMERA's owners, for in no sense is this company 
a mutual. But neither can it be said that the officers and directors are PREMERA's owners, though they surely seize for 
themselves one important attribute of that position: the ability to make final decisions about PREMERA's affairs and future. 
It may not be necessary in the evaluation of the Amended Transaction to ascertain definitively who owns PREMERA. It may 
suffice to assure that the people of the states of Washington and Alaska will receive the equivalent of PREMERA's fair 
market value. But to the extent that the proposed restrictions cause the Transaction to fall short of this standard, it is 
appropriate to question the basis of those restrictions. AR at 16094-95. "

287,21," Premera argues that the success of Asuris in Eastern Washington refutes Leffler's conclusions regarding its market power in 
that region. (Asuris is the name under which Regence operates in most of Eastern Washington.) Leffler admitted that Asuris is 
an example of a competitor that offers some constraint on Premera's exercise of market power, but he still concluded that 
Premera continues to dominate some markets in these 14 counties, and both he and another economist raised questions 
concerning Asuris's continued success. See  Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Res., Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 366-67 (9th Cir. 1988) (a 
declining market share does not foreclose a finding of market power). "
288,22," The court also appeared to support Leffler's approach to defining the market, as it stated that market share is the initial 
determination, after which a court should consider factors such as the number and strength of the defendant's competitors and 
the difficulty or ease of entry into the market by new competitors.  Reazin, 899 F.2d at 967 n.23 (10th Cir. 1990)."

these provisions. "

individual plaintiff, in Borough of Olyphant v. PP&L Inc., et al, Civ. No. 03-4023, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8958, at *1 (E.D. Pa. May 
14, 2004). This court denied a motion made by Olyphant, and the boroughs that are parties to this action, including Olyphant, to 
consolidate the cases, because discovery in the Olyphant case had been closed for nearly a year, while fact discovery in this 
action had just begun. This court granted summary judgment dismissing Olyphant's breach of contract claims, Sherman Act § 1 
claim, and Clayton Act § 2 claim. Id. This court also dismissed Olyphant's Sherman Act § 2 claim without prejudice to Olyphant's 
ability to pursue the claim in the case at bar. Id. On September 27, 2005, the Third Circuit affirmed this court's decision in Borough of Olyphant: Olyphant also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing its breach of contract claim and 
its claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 2 of the Clayton Act, denying its motion for summary 
judgment with respect to PPL's counterclaims, and granting summary judgment in favor  [**2] of PPL with respect to PPL's 
counterclaim for breach of the dispute resolution clause. . . .We have carefully considered Olyphant's arguments on this 
appeal and find that they lack merit. For the reasons stated in the District Court's well-reasoned and thorough opinion, we 
find that summary judgment was properly granted. Borough of Olyphant v. PPL Corp, 153 Fed. Appx. 80, 82-83 (3d Cir. 2005). "

316,5," Though plaintiffs claim that the Joint Petition designates PPL as the sole POLR in its territories, this is not entirely the case. Pl. 
Statement of Facts, P17. The Joint Petition specifically states that ""20% of PPL's residential customers -- determined by random 
selection . . .-- shall be assigned to a provider of last resort default supplier other than PP&L that will be selected on the basis of 
a Commission-approved energy and capacity market price bidding process. This service shall be referred to as Competitive 
Default Service (""CDS"")."" Pl. Exh. 15, p. 16 (emphasis added). The Joint Petition goes on to specify that ""PP&L's EDC or PP&L's 
divisional or affiliated EGS's may not bid (either directly or as a partner or participant in any business combination with a bidder) 
on CDS service"" and if ""the number of residential customers served by the CDS has fallen below 17%, a further random 
selection of customers shall be assigned to CDS service to restore the number of customers for the 20% level."" Id. at 17-18."
316,6," The precise meaning of this agreement is at issue in the instant case. More specifically, exactly which stranded costs, i.e. 
wholesale or retail, PPL forfeited the right to collect from the Boroughs, is a central issue in the resolution of the Boroughs' 
claims. "
320,7," Plaintiffs allege that the POLR rates were fixed at ""below-market"" rates. Pl. Br. 18. Plaintiffs provide a PPL rate schedule, which 
was allegedly attached to the Joint Petition, to support their argument. Pl. Exh. 25. However, plaintiffs provide no evidence of the 
prevailing market rate for energy generation to retail customers, from which one could determine that the POLR rates were 
""below-market."" Pl. Exh. 25. "
321,8," Plaintiffs recognized that the Joint Petition provided as Plaintiff Exhibit 15 was an incomplete copy and claimed to include a 
complete copy as Plaintiff Exhibit 25. See Pl. Sur-Reply to Statement of Facts, P17, n. 4. However, Plaintiff Exhibit 25 appears to 
be a PPL rate schedule and it is unclear how it is related to the Joint Petition. Defendants have provided the court with what 
appears to be a full copy of the Joint Petition, minus the appendixes. Def. Exh. 12."

] The Supreme Court has extended Noerr-Pennington immunity to petitions brought before state and federal 
administrative agencies since they ""are both creatures of the legislature, and arms of the executive."" California Motor Transport 
Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510-11, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972). "
322,10," Plaintiffs argue that the application of the sham exception is not appropriately decided on summary judgment. Pl. Br. 21. 
However, in the two cases plaintiffs cite to support their argument, the courts found there were material issues of fact regarding 
the application of the sham exception that precluded summary judgment. See Kravco Co. v. Valley Forge Center Assoc., 1992 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6478, 10-11 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (finding ""there are conflicts between plaintiffs' and defendants' version of the 
events"" as to whether the sham exception applies, so that summary judgement was not appropriate ""at least on the present 
state of the record.""), Lansdale v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 517 F. Supp. 218, 222 (E.D. Pa. 1981) (finding that plaintiffs provided 
sufficient evidence to show there was a question of fact as to whether the sham exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity 
applies). To defeat summary judgment, plaintiffs can not rely on unsupported assertions that the sham exception applies, but 
rather must present ""specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e). In the instant case 
plaintiffs offer no evidence that PPL was seeking ""private action that is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government 
action."" Allied Tube, 486 U.S. at 500, n.4."
322,11," Plaintiffs also cite Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129 (3d Cir. 1993) in support of their argument that the Noerr 
Pennington doctrine does not apply. In that case the plaintiffs, five of the nation's largest title insurers, collectively agreed to set 
uniform rates for title search and examination services through state ratings bureaus. Id. at 1131. Ratings bureaus are private 
entities, licensed by the state, and the rates became effective unless the state rejected them withing a period of time. See FTC v. 
Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 628, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992). Relying on Allied Tube, the Third Circuit found 
Noerr Pennington immunity unavailable because the plaintiffs' anticompetitive conduct was in a private marketplace. Ticor, 998 
F.2d at 1138, quoting Allied Tube, 486 U.S. at 507. However, in this case, PPL was petitioning a state government agency for 
rate approval and no rates were set absent the PUC's active approval of the Joint Petition, unlike Ticor where rates were 
deemed to have government approval by the state agency's failure to object. Additionally, other Pennsylvania state agencies 
were a part of the petitioning process, unlike the solely private agreements arrived at in Ticor."
322,12," Even if the letter agreements are not subject to Noerr Pennington immunity, they are still not evidence of anticompetitive 
activity independent of the Joint Petition. As discussed supra, plaintiffs fail to explain how these letter agreements are evidence "
323,," of price fixing or market allocation. Pl. Exh. 14. In fact, the part of the letter agreements pertaining to the Joint Petition, is not 
binding without approval of the Joint Petition by the PUC. See Pl. Exh. 14, p. 7 (""This agreement is expressly conditioned upon 
the Pa. PUC's entry of a final order approving the Joint Petition"")."
323,13," Defendants also argue that the Joint Petition and resulting PUC Final Order are protected by the state-action immunity 
doctrine, also known as the Parker doctrine. Def. Br. 31. Because, as discussed supra, the court is satisfied that the letter 
agreements and Joint Petition do not raise a material issue of fact concerning whether defendants violated the Sherman Act and 
that even if they did, defendants are entitled to Noerr Pennington immunity, there is no need to discuss the Parker doctrine. "
325,14," In their amended complaint, plaintiffs request injunctive relief; however, the basis for equitable relief is now moot because the 
Power Supply Agreements terminated on February 1, 2004. Compl. P24(b). Both of the plaintiffs' Sherman Act § 2 claims relate 
to the price PPL charged the Boroughs for wholesale energy. But plaintiffs no longer purchase wholesale energy from PPL, 
since the Power Supply Agreements terminated February 1, 2004. Pl. Exh. 2, Tab B, p. 2. Therefore, plaintiffs only relief can be 
in the form of monetary damages, to which the filed rate doctrine is applicable. "
326,15," Plaintiffs point to City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 927 (2d Cir. 1981) and City of Kirkwood v. 
Union Electric Co., 671 F.2d 1173 (8th Cir. 1982) to support the application of the competitor exception when plaintiffs are 
competitors as well as consumers. Although the courts in City of Groton and City of Kirkwood adopted the competitor exception 
in this context, this argument was rejected in Utilimax. The Third Circuit found that the competitor exception did not apply 
because ""although it may have been a competitor with PPL in one market, it was a customer in the wholesale market. And it is 
PPL's actions in that latter market that form the corpus of Utilimax's complaint."" Utilimax (3d Cir.), 378 F.3d at 308. HN37[
] I 
am, of course, bound to follow the decisions of the Third Circuit. "
327,16, Plaintiffs do not allege that they increased their retail electricity rates as a result of the cost increase in wholesale electricity.
327,17," Plaintiffs fail to cite any case law in support of their argument that the filed rate doctrine should not apply to non-rate 
anticompetitve activity. The principal case discussing exceptions to the filed rate doctrine for non-rate anticompetitive activity 
discovered by the court is In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144, 1159 (3rd Cir. 1993)."
327,18," Plaintiffs argue that ""the need to prove hypothetical rates lower than those that would have been charged in the absence of 
market manipulation and the acceptability of those rates to FERC, and the need to overcome the problem of speculative 
calculation of damages"" does not arise in this case. Pl. Br. 34. However, to resolve plaintiffs' claims the court would be forced to 
speculate whether, without PPL's alleged anticompetitive conduct in the ICAP market, wholesale electricity rates would have 
been low enough for the Boroughs to receive offers to sell wholesale electricity at less than the PPL contract price. Such 
conjecture is necessary, for plaintiffs argue that if a test of the wholesale electricity market had yielded lower rates, plaintiffs 
would have declined to accept PPL's rate increase in 2001 and 2002, rather than accept it and continue under the Power Supply 
Agreement. Pl. Exh. 2, Tab A, Article III; Pl. Exh. 23. Thus, the court would be required to speculate as to FERC-approved 
market-based rates for wholesale electricity. The filed rate doctrine is intended to prevent such conjecture. Keogh v. Chicago & 
N. R. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 165, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183 (U.S. 1922) (reasoning that the filed rate doctrine is applicable because "
328,," ""damages must be proved by facts from which their existence is logically and legally inferable. They cannot be supplied by 
conjecture"")."
328,19," Allegations of this behavior were raised and rejected by this court in the case directly brought by the Borough of Olyphant. See 
Olyphant, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8958, at *54-57, aff'd, 153 Fed. Appx. 80 (3d Cir. 2005)."
328,20," The Borough of Olyphant is barred by the doctrine of res judicata from bringing any additional claims or relitigating any claims 
that were decided in Olyphant, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8958, at *1. See discussion infra Part III. "
329,21," Plaintiffs phrase their price discrimination claim as a violation of Clayton Act § 2; however, it appears they are bringing a claim 
under the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a)."

] Secondary line injury is one of the most common types of price discrimination claims based on the Clayton Act § 2. ""Secondary line injury cases are characterized by price discrimination by a seller in sales to competing buyers."" J.F. Feeser, Inc. 
v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1526 (3d Cir. 1990). In other words, secondary line injury results from a seller charging 
different prices to two purchasers who are in competition with one another. In contrast, primary line injury cases involve injuries 
incurred by a direct competitor of the allegedly discriminating seller. See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 220, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). Plaintiffs state they are asserting a secondary line injury. 
Pl. Br. 23. "
331,23," Plaintiffs support their argument citing FERC Order No. 889 and 889A, which add 18 C.F.R. § 37.4, pertaining to standards of 
conduct for the energy industry. 61 Fed. Reg. 21737 (May 10, 1996) (implementing Part 37 to Code of Federal Regulations); 62 
Fed. Reg. 12484 (May 13, 1997) (revising rules regarding standards of conduct). However, plaintiffs fail to mention that 18 
C.F.R. § 37.4 was repealed by FERC on February 9, 2004 and replaced with 18 C.F.R. Part 358. See 68 Fed. Reg. 69134."
331,24," Because I conclude that intra-entity transfers between two wholly owned subsidiaries of the same parent corporation do not 
amount to a sale under Clayton Act § 2, I do not address whether electricity is a commodity for Robinson-Patman purposes. The "
332,," Third Circuit has yet to rule on this issue, though other courts have gone both ways. Compare, Borough of Ellwood City v. 
Pennsylvania Power Co., 570 F. Supp. 553, 561 (W.D. Pa. 1983), City of Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 1181-82 
(8th Cir. 1982) (finding electricity is a commodity for because it ""can be felt, if not touched. It is produced, sold, stored in small 
quantities, transmitted, and distributed in discrete quantities""), Cablevision v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist., 692 F. Supp. 
691, 693 (S.D. Miss. 1988) (remarking ""most of the courts which have considered the issue have concluded that electricity is a 
commodity subject to the [Robinson-Patman] Act"") with City of Newark v. Delmarva Power & Light Co., 467 F. Supp. 763, 774 
(D. Del. 1979) (finding that the term ""commodity"" in the Robinson-Patman Act was not intended to encompass electric power""), 
City of Groton v. Connecticut Power & Light Co., 497 F. Supp. 1040, 1052 n.14 (D. Conn. 1980), aff'd in part and rev'd on other 
grounds, 662 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1981)."
332,25," Plaintiffs argue that the 1998 Settlement Agreement and the Power Supply Agreements are enforceable under both Section 
317 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. § 825p, and under Pennsylvania state contract law. Pl. Br. 35. Defendants argue that 
plaintiffs have not explained why asserting their claims under 16 U.S.C. § 825p or as state law breach of contract claims should 
change this court's analysis. Def. Br. 35, n.43. However, both plaintiffs and defendants have confused the presence of 
jurisdiction with the basis of the cause of action. HN50[
] Section 317 of the Federal Power Act is a jurisdictional provision, providing federal district courts with the power to hear cases alleging violations of FERC orders. 16 U.S.C. § 825p. This 
jurisdictional grant reinforces the general jurisdictional provisions governing federal district courts. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. 
Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., 341 U.S. 246, 249, 71 S. Ct. 692, 95 L. Ed. 912 (1951). The gravamen of the plaintiffs' claim in 
Count II is a breach of contract claim, which is enforceable under Pennsylvania state contract law. This court has federal 
question jurisdiction over the antitrust claims in Count I pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331; therefore, jurisdiction over Count II's 
breach of contract claim is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 or 16 U.S.C. § 825p. "

333,27," Plaintiffs argue that the term ""firm power requirements"" is ambiguous, thus it should be left to a jury to review extrinsic 
evidence to determine its meaning. Pl. Sur-Reply, 37. However, HN54[
] [i]t is the role of the judge to consider the words of the contract, the alternative meaning suggested by counsel, 
and the nature of the objective evidence to be offered in support of that meaning. The trial judge must then determine if a 
full evidentiary hearing is warranted. If a reasonable alternative interpretation is suggested, even though it may be alien to 
the judge's linguistic experience, objective evidence in support of that interpretation should be considered by the fact finder. "
334,," Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Aetna Business Credit, Inc., 619 F.2d 1001, 1011 (3d Cir. 1980) (emphasis added). Because this court 
finds plaintiffs' suggestion that ""firm power"" requires the installation of a second transmission line is not a reasonable alternative 
interpretation, there is no need for the evidence to be reviewed by a jury."
334,28," Plaintiffs also argue that ""had there been dual lines, only one might have been knocked out by severe weather and there might 
have been no outage in the first place,"" thus establishing that a second transmission line is required under the firm power 
obligation. Pl. Sur-Reply to St. of Facts., P22, p. 45. This argument is a nonstarter. If the court were to accept plaintiffs' logic, 
PPL might be required to install three or four transmission lines because each additional transmission line would make the 
Boroughs less prone to weather related outages. However, the possibility of a weather related outage does not impose a 
contractual obligation upon the defendants to install a second transmission line. Plaintiffs provide no legal support to show that 
two line service is necessary to meet the ""firm power"" requirement. "
335,29," Article 6.2 of the Settlement Agreement contains very similar language to Article 2.6. ""Based on the terms and conditions of 
this Settlement Agreement, PP&L will not seek, and hereby waives the right to seek, any stranded cost recovery or exit fee 
against any of the parties to this Settlement Agreement."" Pl. Exh. 2, Tab A, Article 6.2.2 "
337,30," Plaintiffs believe that Olyphant did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in the FERC proceedings because 
there were ""disputed issues of fact"" and there needed to be ""an evidentiary hearing, which neither agency held."" Pl. Br. 45. 
However, HN60[
] an express finding in a valid judgment is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the issue be actually 
litigated; it is irrelevant that the finding was based on very little evidence. Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 
469 (7th Cir. 1982) (finding that collateral estoppel will preclude relitigation of an issue, no matter how slight the evidence was on 
which a determination was made in the first suit on the same issue.) "
338,31," The issues decided in FERC proceedings carry persuasive force. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 234, 121 S. Ct. 
2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001) HN61[
] (""[A]n agency's interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form, given the 
'specialized experience and broader investigations and information' available to the agency"")."
338,32," In 2002, PPL petitioned FERC for a declaratory order concerning the interpretation of the stranded costs provision of the 
Settlement Agreement. FERC clarified that ""[t]he Settlement Agreement, while addressing PPL's rights to recover wholesale 
stranded costs from the parties to that proceeding, including Olyphant, does not address PPL's rights to recover retail stranded 
costs from its existing retail customers, who were not parties to the Settlement Agreement."" PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, 
101 F.E.R.C. 61,370, 62,544 (2002). Because the parties to the Settlement Agreement were the Boroughs, and not PPL's retail 
customers, ""the Settlement Agreement does not address - and thus would not limit or preclude - PPL's ability to recover retail 
stranded costs from its existing retail customers."" Id. at 62,546."
338,33," HN62[
] FERC has explained the difference between ""wholesale stranded cost"" and ""retail stranded cost"" in the following 
manner: [A]s the definitions of those terms make clear, it is not the nature of the costs (wholesale vs. retail) that is controlling for 
purposes of stranded cost recovery under [Order No. 888]. Rather, the controlling factors are the status of the customer 
(wholesale transmission services customer vs. retail transmission services customer) with whom the costs are associated, 
and whether the transmission tariffs used by the customer to escape its former power supplier (thus causing the stranded 
costs to occur) were required by [the FERC] or by a state commission. As a result, ""retail stranded costs"" refers to stranded 
costs associated with retail wheeling customers. Order No. 888, 78 F.E.R.C. P61,220, n. 475 (1997). Since customers who would purchase energy from the Boroughs, as 
opposed to from PPL directly, would be retail wheeling customers, not wholesale customers, any stranded costs sought to be 
collected from these customers would be considered retail stranded costs. "
339,34," An ""intangible transition charge"" is the amount authorized to be imposed so an electric utility can recover its stranded costs. 
See 66 Pa.C.S. § 2812 (g); see also Borough of Olyphant v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 269 F. Supp. 2d 601, 602 (M.D. Pa. 2003) 
(finding that retail ""stranded costs"" is synonymous with ""competitive"" and ""intangible transition charges"") "
340,35," The Borough of Perkasie is also a party to the Settlement Agreement; however, Perkasie is not a plaintiff in this case. "
341,36," When asked more specific questions regarding whether retail customers are subject to paying stranded costs in the Borough 
of Olyphant, Sipics recognized his inability to answer such a legal issue and said that he ""would have to talk to lawyers"" to 
decide whether stranded costs could be charged. Def. Exh. 14, p. 101-102."
341,37," Defendant PPL Energy Plus, L.L.C, though not a defendant in Olyphant, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL, Inc, which was 
a defendant in Olyphant. Thus, there is privity between the parties. Greenberg v. Potomac Health Sys., 869 F. Supp. 328, 331 "
342,," (E.D. Pa. 1994) (finding that a subsidiary company was in privity with its parent company and one of the parent company's 
officers)."
342,38," In Olyphant, this court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the Borough of Olyphant's Sherman Act § 2 claim 
with respect to monopolization of the wholesale power market ""without prejudice to the right of plaintiff to pursue this claim in the 
Lansdale action."" Olyphant, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8958, at *48. Thus, defendants do not argue that the Borough of Olyphant is 
barred by res judicata from asserting this claim in the case at bar. Def. Br. 44, n. 52."
342,39," Olyphant's alleged ""new facts"" seem to consist of a regurgitation of legal arguments. Other than the deposition of John F. 
Sipics, the answers to Interrogatories 16-19 refer to documents and depositions that plaintiffs have not provided in their 
opposition to summary judgment. Pl. Exh. 4. Thus it is unclear to the court what new facts have come to light that would impact 
the court's decision now, compared to its decision in Olyphant. "
348,1," Last November, we denied defendants' motion to dismiss the direct purchaser action. See In re: Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust 
Litig., 401 F. Supp. 2d 451 (E.D. Pa. 2005)."
348,2," Indirect purchasers are individuals who allege that they have overpaid for a particular product as a result of a defendant's 
anticompetitive actions, but who did not purchase the allegedly affected product from the defendant. This happens most often 
when ""a consumer (or other down-the-line purchaser) buys from an innocent intermediary who was overcharged due to its 
supplier's antitrust violation."" 2 Phillip E. Areeda, Roger D. Blair, & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust 
Principles and Their Application § 346a, at 359 (2d ed. 2000). In that situation, the intermediary may sue the offender for 
damages, but the consumer, under Illinois Brick, may (except in extremely limited circumstances) sue only for injunctive relief. 
Id. Illinois Brick prompted as many as thirty-seven states to enact ""Illinois Brick Repealer"" statutes, which permit indirect 
purchasers to sue for treble damages under state law. See, e.g., Donald I. Baker, Federalism and Futility: Hitting Potholes on the 
Illinois Brick Road, Antitrust, Fall 2002, at 14; Jonathan T. Tomlin & Dale J. Giali, Federalism and the Indirect Purchaser Mess, 
11 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 157, 161 (2002). Under CAFA, plaintiffs attorneys must now bring most indirect purchaser class actions under state antitrust law in federal court. 
See, e.g., Bruce V. Spiva & Jonathan K. Tycko, Indirect Purchaser Litigation on Behalf of Consumers After CAFA, Antitrust, Fall 
2005, at 12. As one commentator has remarked, this means that, ""as a practical matter, state courts will rarely get to interpret 
their own state antitrust laws, particularly in indirect purchaser suits, because they are so often brought as class actions."" Id."
348,3," Under our Order, defendants' failure to identify a deficiency in the first complaint would have waived their right to attack that 
deficiency in a subsequent motion to dismiss. "
349,4," The named plaintiffs are: (1) Joelle Prochera (Arizona); (2) Colorfast Dye and Printhouse, Inc. (California); (3) Frank Gerenscer 
(California); (4) Bernard Lawrence Winery (California); (5) Terry Muzzey (Nebraska); (6) Melinda Owens (Tennessee); (7) 
Elizabeth Armstrong (Vermont); (8) the City of Stockton (California); and (9) Orange County Sanitation District (California). See 
Compl. PP3-11."
349,5," Defendants fall into six groups: (1) Atofina Chemicals, Inc., Arkema, Inc., TotalFinaElf S.A., and Total S.A. (the ""Atofina Defendants""); (2) Solvay Interox, Inc., Solvay America, Inc., Solvay Chemicals, Inc., and Solvay S.A. (the ""Solvay Defendants""); (3) Degussa Corporation and Degussa A.G. (the ""Degussa Defendants""); (4) EKA Chemicals, Inc., Akzo Nobel, Inc., and Akzo Nobel Chemical International B.V. (the ""Akzo Defendants""); (5) Kemira Chemicals, Inc. and Kemira Oyj (the ""Kemira Defendants""); and (6) FMC Corporation. See Compl. PP12-33; see also February 2, 2006 Order P2."
349,6," Unlike the Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Vermont sub-classes, the California sub-class may be more further divided into 
private and public indirect purchasers. Compare Compl. PP108-117 with Compl. PP77-86."
349,7," As defendants note, Judge Kramer has extensive experience adjudicating complex cases. See Def.s' Mem., at 20 n.20. "
350,8," While the California public indirect purchasers ask us to abstain, the private ones take no position on this issue. See Pl.s' 
Resp., at 9, 17. "
351,9," The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on CAFA begins with its authors' conclusions about the shortcomings of state court 
class action litigation: By now, there should be little debate about the numerous problems with our current class action system. A mounting stack 
of evidence reviewed by the Committee demonstrates that abuses are undermining the rights of both plaintiffs and 
defendants. One key reason for these problems is that most class actions are currently adjudicated in state courts, where 
the governing rules are applied inconsistently (frequently in a manner that contravenes basic fairness and due process 
considerations) and where there is often inadequate supervision over litigation procedures and proposed settlements."
351,*," * * To make matters worse, current law enables lawyers to ""game"" the procedural rules and keep nationwide or multi-state 
class actions in state courts whose judges have reputations for readily certifying classes and approving settlements without 
regard to class member interests. In this environment, consumers are the big losers: In too many cases, state court judges 
are readily approving class action settlements that offer little -- if any -- meaningful recovery to the class members and 
simply transfer money from corporations to class counsel. S. Rep. 109-14, at 4 (2005), as reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 5-6. "
358,1," Defendant Titan Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha asserts lack of personal jurisdiction and does not join the present motion to dismiss. 
The plaintiffs have settled their claims against ISK Magnetics, Inc.; ISKA; Ishihara Corporation (USA); Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, 
Ltd.; Sakai Trading New York, Inc.; Sakai Chemical Co. Ltd.; and Sakai Trading Co. Ltd. "
359,2," Defendants assert that the claims of ""import commerce"" are out of the case, as a result of the July 20, 2005, order dismissing 
the claims of the foreign plaintiffs. However, even though eMag USA is not the importer here -- the imported MIO was 
manufactured in Japan by Japanese affiliates of Toda Kogyo and Sakai Trading, and then imported into the U.S., where eMag 
USA purchased it-eMag USA has nonetheless alleged the requisite effect on domestic commerce, which the court found lacking 
with regard to the foreign plaintiffs. "
360,3," Unlike Article III standing, ""antitrust standing"" is not jurisdictional. Datagate, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 60 F.3d 1421, 1425 
n.1 (9th Cir. 1995). Rather, it is an element of the claim. "
361,4," This general principle also must be considered in light of the requirement of the FTAIA, which provides that the Sherman Act 
""shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce . . . with foreign nations,"" unless that conduct has a ""direct, substantial, 
and reasonably foreseeable effect"" effect on domestic commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 6a. "
362,5," Defendants do not raise this issue in their moving papers. In its opposition, eMag USA asserts that some circuits have applied 
this ""jurisdictional rule"" only to conduct that is wholly foreign, and others only to conduct that is at least primarily foreign, but 
claims that the Ninth Circuit has not made clear whether the jurisdictional requirement of a substantial impact on U.S. commerce 
applies only to conduct that is wholly foreign or also to conduct that is primarily foreign."
362,6," The court does not concur with eMag USA's interpretation of the cited section of the opinion in Metro Industries, 82 F.3d at 847-
49. The requirement that an antitrust plaintiff show injury to competition in the United States is part of the ""rule of reason"" 
analysis. It is not a ""jurisdictional rule"" or an ""additional element"" of a case where the Sherman Act claim is based on foreign 
conduct. The Metro Industries court did discuss in an earlier section, see 82 F.3d at 845-47, the rule that jurisdictional inquiries 
are required when a Sherman Act claim is based on foreign conduct -- i.e., to determine whether the alleged restraint affected 
the foreign commerce of the United States. But that is not the same as the additional element required to state a claim for a ""rule 
of reason"" case. Moreover, although eMag USA discusses this ""additional jurisdictional element"" at length, the court does not 
find it to be a necessary allegation in this case, as a) the court previously disposed of the claims relating to foreign commerce, b) 
the price-fixing at issue here relates to the price charged for MIO to a U.S. company (eMag USA) in the United States; and c) the 
jurisdictional issues are controlled by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the FTAIA (see July 20, 2005, Order Granting Motion 
to Dismiss). Allegations that an antitrust case involves only foreign conduct raises a jurisdictional issue. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 6a; F. 
Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004). This jurisdictional 
requirement focuses on whether there is sufficient effect on the commerce of the United States to support application of U.S. 
law, whereas the requirement that the plaintiff allege injury or anticompetitive effect focuses on whether the plaintiff can state a 
claim under the Sherman Act. "
363,7," Defendants rely on the statement in the January 10, 2005, order, where the court dismissed the SAC ""because plaintiffs do not 
allege facts showing that the agreements actually caused injury to competition"" and ""do [not] assert facts showing the impact on 
themselves, individually, or within the field of commerce in which they are engaged,"" and cited Les Shockley Racing in support. 
Jan. 10, 2005, Order at 8. While it is true that courts presumptively apply ""the rule of reason"" analysis in Sherman Act § 1 cases, 
the statement in the January 10 order should not be viewed as a ruling that the case must be subjected to a ""rule of reason"" 
analysis (although Les Schockley is a ""rule of reason"" case). The question whether it was a per se or a ""rule of reason"" case 
was not briefed by the parties and did not arise at all in connection with the defendants' motions. Moreover, the second 
amended complaint was so ""deficient in pleading the facts purporting to state a claim for violation of the Sherman Act"" that it was 
""impossible to ascertain which claims [were] being asserted, or by or against whom."" Jan. 10, 2005, Order at 5. "

enforce the higher filed-tariff rate if the tariff was void for some technicality like the one asserted by Plaintiff in this action. As an 
equitable exception to the filed rate doctrine, carriers were not allowed to enforce improperly filed (void) tariffs. "

] Antitrust injury is made up of four elements: (1) unlawful conduct, (2) causing an injury to the plaintiff, (3) that flows 
from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. Additionally, 
the injured party must be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors, such as a consumer of the alleged 
violator's goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator in the restrained market. Id. (citations omitted). "

document whose legal validity is at issue is a printed form that contains many terms and clearly purports to be a contract; (2) the 
form has been drafted by, or on behalf of, one party to the transaction; (3) the drafting party participates in numerous 
transactions of the type represented by the form and enters into these transactions as a matter of routine; (4) the form is 
presented to the adhering party with the representation that, except perhaps for a few identified items, the drafting party will 
enter into the transaction only on the terms contained in the document (this representation may be explicit or may be implicit in 
the situation, but it is understood by the adherent); and (5) the adhering party enters into few transactions of the type

or courts, a claim based upon such event, facts or dispute."" The 2002/2003 version states in relevant part: ""YOU MUST 
CONTACT US WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO 
A DISPUTE . . . OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE A CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS OR DISPUTE."" 
The language is nearly identical. "
440,7," This result makes sense because, once the dispute is in arbitration, the tenet of contra proferentem can still be applied by the 
arbitrator on non-scope issues."
440,8," HN8[
] 47 C.F.R. § 76.1603(b) states: ""customers will be notified of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as soon as possible in writing. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of such 
changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. In addition, the cable operator shall notify subscribers 30 days 
in advance of any significant changes in the other information required by § 76.1602. The ""other information required by § 
76.1602"" includes ""prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other 
services."" 47 C.F.R. § 76.1602(b)(2). "
441,9," Additionally, given the fact that the 2002 and 2003 Policies & Practices are identical, and given the fact that Plaintiffs did not file 
suit until December 2003, there is at least some doubt that the notice requirements of the statute, regulations, and subscriber 
agreements are even implicated. "
445,10," It is true that the district court concluded that the Policies & Practices is a contract of adhesion. However, under 
Massachusetts law, contracts of adhesion -- like the Policies & Practices -- are generally enforceable absent a separate finding 
that such contracts are ""unconscionable, offend public policy, or are shown to be unfair in the particular circumstances."" Owen, 
32 Mass. App. Ct. at 253. The Policies & Practices is not invalid simply because it is a contract of adhesion. "
447,11," Because we find that the 2002/2003 agreements apply retroactively, we do not reach Comcast's on-going injury argument in 
that context."
447,12," 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) states in relevant part: HN24[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the 
defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained . . . ."""
447,13," Massachusetts General Laws, ch.93, § 12 states in relevant part: HN25[
] ""If the court finds that the violation was engaged in 
with malicious intent to injure said person, the court may award up to three times the amount of actual damages sustained, 
together with the costs of suit . . . ."" "
448,14," Our statement from MCI is dicta because the argument that the panel was discussing had been waived on appeal. However, 
the panel decided to discuss the ramifications of this argument anyway."
448,15," It may seem odd to include in our ""threshold"" analysis (determining who the proper decision maker will be -- a court or an 
arbitrator) some merits analysis (determining whether the conflict between the arbitration agreements and the statutory provision "
449,," invalidates the arbitral forum for the underlying antitrust claim). However, in this particular context, the enforceability of the 
arbitration agreement turns on the question of waiver -- can a contracting party waive its right to the treble damages provided by 
the antitrust statute. If the answer to that question were uncertain, or, to use the language of Pacificare, ambiguous, the conflict 
between the arbitration agreement and the statute would not pose a question of arbitrability. To decide whether a court or an 
arbitrator should decide the merits, we must see whether resolution of the merits question, i.e., the legal consequences of the 
conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statutory provision, are obvious. This is the lesson of Pacificare, where the Supreme Court conducted the kind of preliminary merits investigation that we are 
conducting here. There, confronted by a conflict between the language of the RICO statute, which authorized the award of treble 
damages, and an arbitration provision, which prohibited the award of punitive damages, see 538 U.S. at 403, the Supreme Court 
examined whether and under what circumstances treble damages and punitive damages were equivalent. See id. at 405-06; see 
also, supra n.10. Because the legal consequences of the conflict between the arbitration provision and the RICO statute were 
not clear, the Supreme Court concluded its threshold analysis by sending the decision to the arbitrator to make the merits 
determination in the first instance. This choice serves the purpose of advancing the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration 
agreements. See Howsam, 537 U.S. at 83 (""The Court has also long recognized and enforced a liberal federal policy favoring 
arbitration agreements."" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). There are precedents for this preliminary assessment of the merits from other contexts. When deciding whether to grant a 
preliminary injunction, district courts must assess the probability of success on the merits of the party requesting the preliminary 
injunction. In such a situation, the district court does not actually decide the merits. What we are required to do here is akin to a 
preliminary injunction analysis. As we shall see, that preliminary assessment and its final outcome are not necessarily the same. "
450,16," HN30[
] A ""savings clause"" preemptively resolves conflicts between contract language and applicable law in order to 
preserve the remaining, non-conflicting contract language. ""Savings clause"" is somewhat of a misnomer. The contractual 
language in conflict with applicable law is not saved. The non-conflicting language is saved. In the absence of a savings clause, 
the decision maker, be it an arbitrator or a court, decides the remedy for resolving a conflict between contract language and 
applicable law. That remedy, driven by an assessment of the intent of the parties, could be as small as severance of the 
offending contract language, or it could extend to outright non-enforcement of portions of the contract that include the offending 
contract language or the contract in its entirety. In essence, a savings clause serves as an expression of the intent of the parties 
that limits the remedies an arbitrator or court may use in situations of conflict between contract terms and applicable law. The 
savings clause at issue here, contained in the ""Limitation on Liability"" section of the Policies & Practices, emphasizes the use of 
severance as a remedy. "
452,17," 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) states in relevant part that HN34[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the 
defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover . . . the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" Mass. Gen. Laws. c. 93 § 12 states in relevant part that HN35[
] ""if the court finds 
that the violation was engaged in with malicious intent to injure said person, the court may award up to three times the amount of 
actual damages sustained, together with the costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys fees."" While there is still the ""shall"" versus ""may"" distinction between the federal and state antitrust statutes, we find that this distinction 
does not require a separate analysis as to attorney's fees and costs along federal versus state lines. The ""may"" in the state 
statute does not apply to the award of costs and attorney's fees. The clause containing ""may"" is separated from the ""costs of 
suit"" clause by a comma. While a state court may award up to three times the amount of actual damages, the costs of suit, 
including attorney's fees, are mandatorily awarded. "
456,18," In Jenkins, the Eleventh Circuit decided a similar case using an unconscionability rationale. However, the court relied on 
another of its decisions, which used a ""vindication of statutory rights"" rationale. The Jenkins court equated the two rationales. 
See Jenkins, 400 F.3d at 877-78; see also Randolph v. Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama, 244 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir. 
2001)(hereinafter Randolph II)."
456,19," The Eleventh Circuit's decision in Jenkins -- also a suit against a financial lender -- extended the circuit's holding in Randolph 
II enforcing a class mechanism bar in an arbitration agreement to a plaintiff's claims under Georgia usury law. See Jenkins, 400 
F.3d at 870, 877-78. While Jenkins is the more recent decision, Randolph II established the rule in favor of enforcing class 
mechanism bars in arbitration agreements for the Eleventh Circuit. Therefore, we will use Randolph II for purposes of our 
analysis. "
458,20," HN40[
] ""Opportunity costs"" are the value of work an attorney foregoes in order to prosecute a particular plaintiff's claim. "
459,21," We recognize that the antitrust statutes provide for an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Hence, arguably, an 
attorney could rely on that statutory award instead of a contingent fee agreement to recoup the investment of attorney time. 
However, this would be, at best, a dubious investment for any rational attorney. Antitrust cases by their nature are difficult and 
uncertain. In any individual case, the disproportion between the damages awarded to an individual consumer antitrust plaintiff 
and the attorney's fees incurred to prevail on the claim would be so enormous that it is highly unlikely that an attorney could ever 
begin to justify being made whole by the court. (For example, using the figures of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses, the recovery for an 
individual plaintiff in this case would, at most, be in the thousands of dollars whereas attorney time could escalate into the 
millions of dollars.) Moreover, being made whole is hardly a sufficient incentive for an attorney to invest in a case such as this 
when time spent on more predictable cases would be advantageous, and frankly, rational."
459,22," We realize that a state unconscionability analysis, based on the particulars of state contract law, may include considerations 
not present in the vindication of statutory rights analysis applied here, which is not dependent on state law. However, the 
unconscionability analysis always includes an element that is the essence of the vindication of statutory rights analysis -- the 
frustration of the right to pursue claims granted by statute. For example, in Faber v. Menard, Inc., 367 F.3d 1048 (8th Cir. 2004), 
the Eighth Circuit held that ""[a] fee-splitting arrangement may be unconscionable if information specific to the circumstances 
indicates that fees are cost-prohibitive and preclude the vindication of statutory rights in an arbitral forum"" while citing Randolph, 
531 U.S. at 90, a vindication of statutory rights case. Faber, 367 F.3d at 1053; see also, supra n. 18; Jenkins, 400 F.3d at 877-
78. "
460,23," Other courts, both federal and state, have struck down class arbitration bars on similar grounds. See, e.g., Luna v.  Household 
Fin. Corp. III, 236 F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1178 (W.D. Wash. 2002); Lozada v. Dale Baker Oldsmobile, Inc., 91 F. Supp. 2d 1087, 
1105 (W.D. Mich. 2000); Discover Bank, 36 Cal.4th at 162-63; Powertel, Inc. v. Bexley, 743 So. 2d 570, 576 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 
1999); State ex rel. Dunlap v. Berger, 211 W. Va. 549, 567 S.E.2d 265, 278-79 (W. Va. 2002). "
461,24," HN43[
]  ""Ambiguity -- the possibility that a word or phrase in a contract might be reasonably and plausibly subject to more 
than one meaning -- frequently occurs in the language used by the [contracting] parties to express their meaning. Since the 
language is presumptively within the control of the party drafting the agreement, it is a generally accepted principle that any 
ambiguity in that language will be interpreted against the drafter. This rule is frequently described under the Latin term of contra 
proferentem, literally, against the offeror, he who puts forth, or proffers or offers the language. . . . Indeed, any contract of 
adhesion, a contract entered without any meaningful negotiation by a party with inferior bargaining power, is particularly 
susceptible to the rule that ambiguities will be construed against the drafter."" 11 Williston on Contracts § 32:12 (4th ed.) (2005). "
462,25," Comcast filed the motion to compel arbitration that has triggered this interlocutory proceeding. Presumably, Comcast could 
seek to withdraw that motion to compel if it does not like the conditions that now apply to the arbitral forum. We venture no 
opinion on how the district court should respond to any such development. "
465,1," Although the Plaintiffs have filed affidavits, the Defendant does not rely upon materials outside of the pleadings. There are no 
disputed facts. Therefore, it is appropriate to address the legal issues presented in a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. "
472,1," For ease of reference, the Court refers to the LCB and WBWWA collectively as ""Defendants."" "
473,2," As discussed in the conclusions of law below, the Court concludes that Costco's challenge to Washington's ban on retailer-to-
retailer sales of beer and wine should be dismissed as a matter of law because this policy is a unilateral restraint and is not 
preempted by the Sherman Act. As a result, the Court's discussion of the ""challenged restraints"" in the findings of fact should not 
be construed as including the ban on retailer-to-retailer sales. "
479,3," The restraints that prevent retailers from operating warehouses that include wine (RCW 66.24.185(4)) and limit output from 
wine warehouses (WAC 314-24-220(5)) were not explicitly addressed in the Court's previous orders on summary judgment 
motions, largely because Costco did not identify those restraints in its complaint. However, Costco raised both restraints in its 
summary judgment briefing and the Court granted an oral motion by Costco at trial to conform the pleadings to the evidence. 
Therefore, to the extent that RCW 66.24.185(4) and WAC 314-24-220(5) would prevent retailers from operating central 
warehouses that include wine and would limit the output of wine from a central warehouse operated by a retailer, the Court finds 
that these restraints are analytically indistinct from those specifically mentioned the Court's previous summary judgment rulings."
479,4," The parties have provided virtually no briefing on Costco's § 1983 claims. It is questionable in any case that a § 1983 claim 
may be based on violations of federal antitrust laws. See, e.g., Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. v. Prince George's County, 601 F. 
Supp. 892, 913 n.29 (D. Md. 1985) (""the Court does not believe that violation of the antitrust laws may be the basis for a § 1983 
action""); Bonollo Rubbish Removal, Inc. v. Town of Franklin, 886 F. Supp. 955, 965-66 (D. Mass. 1995) (similar); see generally 
City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 125 S. Ct. 1453, 161 L. Ed. 2d 316 (2005) (discussing limitations on 
maintaining Section 1983 actions based on violations of federal law). "
482,1," Specifically, the settled actions are those incorporated in Plaintiffs' Master Complaint filed on March 8, 2002. "
483,2," ""Reliant"" means, collectively, defendants Reliant Energy Services, Inc., Reliant Energy Coolwater, Inc., Reliant Energy 
Ellwood, Inc., Reliant Energy Etiwanda, Inc., Reliant Energy Mandalay, Inc., and Reliant Energy Ormond Beach, Inc., as well 
Reliant Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy [*3]  Power Generation, Inc., Reliant Energy California Holdings, Inc., and each of the 
affiliates and subsidiaries of Reliant Energy, Inc. "
525,1," CCN and other former defendants have settled with plaintiffs, and a stipulation of dismissal was so ordered by this Court on 
November 14, 2005. Plaintiffs expressly reserved their claims against all non-settling defendants. Despite the dismissal against 
some of the parties to the alleged conspiracy, assuming a claim is stated, evidence of a conspiracy and all damages can still be 
pursued against the non-settling defendants. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Res., Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 342-47, 91 S. Ct. 
795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). "
530,2," I further note that, contrary to defendants' assertion that Medscan has not alleged that it has been foreclosed from competing 
(id.), plaintiffs have repeatedly alleged such harm to both Kerr and Medscan. (See, e.g., Compl. P53 (alleging ""the elimination 
from the market of plaintiff Dr. Kerr's & Medscan's competing services and facilities"") (emphasis added))."
530,3," Defendants further argue that plaintiffs have ""improperly equated Kerr's decreased sales with decreased marketwide 
competition in the relevant market."" (Reply at 8). Of course, at trial or summary judgment, plaintiffs may not be able to offer 
sufficient proof to establish an effect on marketwide competition. Accepting the allegations as true as the Court must on a motion 
to dismiss, however, plaintiffs' claim that defendants' conduct caused both an effect on market-wide competition and a decrease 
in Kerr's business following her loss of CCN-approval is at least plausible."
530,4," Defendants have not argued that plaintiffs are inefficient enforcers of the antitrust laws. Nevertheless, I note that, even if 
plaintiffs' primary motivations in bringing this action are to increase their own profits, to the extent they seek an injunction against 
the allegedly unlawful conduct and appropriate relief to restore competition in the provision of PET/CT scanning services, their 
interests coincide with those of the patient-consumer. Thus, at this stage in the litigation, there is no reason to conclude that 
plaintiffs will be inefficient enforcers of the antitrust laws. "
531,5," Defendants claim that Litt, as a board member of CCN, was incapable of conspiring with CCN. Where an employee or officer 
has a personal interest or an interest for another entity, however, it may be possible for that individual to conspire with the board. 
See Volvo North Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l Tennis Corp., 857 F.2d 55 (2d Cir. 1988); Hahn v. Oregon Physicians' Service, 868 
F.2d 1022, 1029-30 9th Cir. 1988); Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 802 F. Supp. 912, 924 (W.D.N.Y. 1992) (discussing 
cases). Moreover, the complaint alleges that Litt was acting on behalf of NYU, not on behalf of CCN, when he threatened to 
terminate plaintiffs' CCN-approval. "
536,1," The statute defines oral prophylaxis as ""the removal of any and all hard and soft deposits, accretions, toxins, and stain from 
any natural or restored surfaces of teeth or prosthetic devices by scaling and polishing as a preventive measure for the control of 
local irritational factors."" S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-85(3) (West Supp. 2003)."
536,2," Normally, emergency regulations are only valid for 90 days. Because the legislature was out of session both when the 
regulation was filed and when the 90-day period expired, this regulation was extended for an additional 90 days."
536,3," See 2003 S.C. Acts 210-15. Those amendments eliminated the preexamination requirement for patients being treated in the 
""public health"" setting (i.e., by hygienists working under the control of the Department of Health and Environmental Control State 
Dental Coordinator), while maintaining the preexamination requirement for hygienists working in private dental offices. See S.C. 
Code Ann. §§ 40-15-102, -110 (West Supp. 2003). "
537,4," On August 17, 2004, the FTC stayed that discovery pending the outcome of this appeal."
537,5," We note that the Federal Trade Commission Act does not use the same ""final judgment"" language as § 1291; instead, it 
conditions appellate jurisdiction on ""an order of the Commission to cease and desist from using any method of competition or 
practice."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 45(c) (West 1997). Given this distinction, an argument could be made that the collateral order doctrine, 
which represents a ""practical construction"" of § 1291's final judgment rule, see Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 
U.S. 863, 867, 114 S. Ct. 1992, 128 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1994), does not apply. The FTC does not advance this argument, however. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court seems to have rejected this contention. See Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 
U.S. 232, 246, 101 S. Ct. 488, 66 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1980) (applying collateral order analysis to determine whether FTC's non-final 
decision to issue an administrative complaint was immediately appealable). Therefore, for the purposes of this case, we assume 
that the collateral order analysis applies to the FTC's decision. "
538,6," The Supreme Court has specifically reserved judgment on whether a governor (and other executive branch officers) may 
invoke ipso facto Parker immunity. See Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 568 n. 17, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984). It 
has, however, suggested that the answer is no. See S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 57, 105 
S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985) (stating that ""the circumstances in which Parker immunity is available . . . to state agencies 
or officials regulating the conduct of private parties"" are governed by the ""clear articulation"" test set forth in California Liquor 
Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980)). Nevertheless, several courts 
of appeals have extended the ipso facto Parker exemption to executive officers and agencies. See, e.g., Neo Gen Screening, 
Inc. v. New Eng. Newborn Screening Program, 187 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1999) (state board of health); Charley's Taxi Radio 
Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Hawaii, Inc., 810 F.2d 869, 875-76 (9th Cir. 1987) (state director of transportation); Saenz v. Univ. 
Interscholastic League, 487 F.2d 1026, 1027-28 (5th Cir. 1973) (Extension Division of University of Texas at Austin). The Board 
urges us to follow suit and hold it is entitled to ipso facto Parker immunity. Given that we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal, 
we do not reach this issue. "
539,7," Of course, Huron Valley, like Parker, involved a case under the Sherman Act. This case, by contrast, originated under the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 45 (West 1997). But this distinction does not render Parker inapplicable. See Fed. 
Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 635, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992) (applying Parker analysis in 
case arising only under FTCA). Nor does this fact change our analysis of the separability of the Parker claim from the merits 
action; while ""unfair competition"" may not be coterminous with ""anticompetitive conduct,"" the two concepts are still intimately 
intertwined. Indeed, anticompetitive conduct under the Sherman Act is a species of ""unfair competition"" under 15 U.S.C.A. § 45. 
See Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Cement Inst., 333 U.S. 683, 690-94, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 44 F.T.C. 1460 (1948). "
541,8," The Eleventh Amendment technically bars a person from suing a state or its agency to seek injunctive relief. Cory v. White, 457 
U.S. 85, 91, 102 S. Ct. 2325, 72 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1982) (""Thus, the Eleventh Amendment by its terms clearly applies to a suit 
seeking an injunction, a remedy available only from equity.""). But a plaintiff may bring the suit against a state officer in his official 
capacity seeking prospective injunctive relief, thereby effecting the same result. Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 71 n. 14, "
542,116," S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996) (""An individual can bring suit against a state officer in order to ensure that the officer's 
conduct is in compliance with federal law.""). "
544,1," Claims by additional Plaintiffs Andy Carroll and Brad Ledbetter were dismissed on January 9, 2006 by order of this Court, 
pursuant to a stipulation of the parties. (Order (Dkt. No. 77).)"
544,2," A ""counter"" is ""an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport."" 
NCAA, 2003-04 NCAA DIVISION I MANUAL, Bylaw 15.02.3 (2003) [hereinafter NCAA MANUAL]."
544,3," ""Grants-in-aid"" apply toward the ""cost of attendance,"" which the NCAA defines as the ""total cost of tuition and fees, room and 
board, books and supplies, transportation, and other expenses related to attendance at the institution."" NCAA MANUAL, Bylaw 
15.02.2. However, a ""full grant-in-aid"" is limited to ""tuition and fees, room and board, and required course-related books."" Id. 
Bylaw 15.02.5. Student athletes may not receive financial aid that exceeds the value of a full grant-in-aid. Id. Bylaw 15.1."
544,4," The ""roster,"" as used herein, refers to the list of ""squad members"" on the ""first day of competition."" NCAA MANUAL, Bylaw 
15.5.9.2. The roster includes both scholarship and non-scholarship players."
544,5," As ""walk-ons,"" Plaintiffs may have been recruited or unrecruited, but they have in common that they did not initially receive a 
GIA award. (See Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 17) 6.) A walk-on may later be awarded a GIA, which then counts toward the school's 85-
GIA limit. "
545,6," Taken literally, this wording would mean that a class period of four years would start in 2008 (4 years from 2004). However, it is 
clear that the parties contemplate a four-year statute of limitations boundary on the class that ended in 2004 and includes 
players who participated in football seasons corresponding with academic years 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04. (See 
Am. Compl. 7-9 (discussing the named Plaintiffs' season involvement as walk-ons); Def.'s Opp'n, Ordover Decl. P 9 n.4 (""I 
understand that the 'class period' is the four academic years from 2000-01 through 2003-04."").)"
545,7," The Court acknowledges that some players may receive scholarships but, due to circumstances such as injuries, etc., still do 
not ""count"" toward their school's limit of 85. For the sake of this brief discussion, the Court assumes that everyone with a 
scholarship ""counts"" and attends pre-season practice. "
546,8," Neither side asserts that the opposing expert is unqualified. Moreover, both Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Tollison and the NCAA's expert 
Dr. Ordover appear to have sufficient qualifications. (Pls.' Mot., Tollison Decl. Ex. 1 (curriculum vitae), Ex. 2 (expert testimony 
and reports provided in other cases); Def.'s Opp'n, Ordover Decl. Ex. 1 (curriculum vitae), Ex. 2 (expert testimony provided in 
other cases).) "
547,9," It is undisputed that the average roster size during the seasons at issue in this lawsuit (2000-04) was at least 115. (Pl.'s Mot., 
Tollison Decl. P 41 tbl.4 (showing data from the NCAA's website about roster sizes).) "
548,10," See Martino v. McDonald's System, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 81, 85 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (""Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the representative 
parties' claims be typical, not that the parties themselves be typical.""). "
550,11, See infra subsection V.B for further discussion of whether such classwide proof is sufficient.
550,12," The NCAA's final challenge to adequacy of representation -- that the named plaintiffs are ""not typical of, or even in, the class"" 
(Def.'s Opp'n 23) -- does not raise an appropriate class certification inquiry. Rather, it goes to standing. The U.S. Supreme Court 
""has held that standing is not a class issue, but a requirement that must be met by every plaintiff, whether the suit is brought 
individually or on behalf of a class."" NEWBERG § 18:15, at 48 n.2 (citing Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 92 S. Ct. 2318, 33 L. Ed. 2d "
551,154," (1972), and noting that the ""so-called membership in the class requirement"" is ""in reality . . . a conclusion, not an 
independent class representative test, that the plaintiff has standing and that the plaintiff's claims are typical.""). The NCAA has not claimed that the Plaintiffs lack standing to sue the NCAA regarding Bylaw 15.5.5. Rather, the NCAA attempts 
to add to the class definition requirements that walk-ons were ""carefully recruited"" and that they were ""most likely to play in 
actual games,"" specifically by noting that Nicholas Pilipauskis was ""not recruited, carefully or at all"" and that Dennis DuBois and 
Michael Whitesel never played in any games. (Def.'s Opp'n 24.) These characteristics are not part of the proposed class 
definition, and these Plaintiffs' capacity to represent the class cannot be challenged on these bases. The only seemingly 
legitimate challenge to the representative Plaintiffs' ""class membership"" is that to Dennis DuBois, because he allegedly never 
participated in pre-season practice at any school. (See Def.'s Opp'n, Wheeler Decl. Ex. F (Dep. of Dennis DuBois 56-57, 89).) 
This, however, is not a class certification issue and has no impact on the named Plaintiffs' ability to adequately represent the 
purported class. "
557,1, These are just a few examples of end users within the foodservice industry and not an exhaustive list. 
558,2," Because Sysco orders in bulk for all of its clients it must then provide proof of sales to Michael Foods to identify which of the 
products it sells to Sodexho."
558,3," For purposes of the instant action, rebates and allowances are interchangeable. "
559,4," Feesers initially filed a declaration of its expert, Dr. Larner, which did not reflect rebates and allowances. Feesers filed a second 
declaration, however, which included rebates and allowances in the calculations; however, the second set of numbers covered 
only a portion of the years covered by the first set. The court finds the reports submitted in conjunction with the first declaration 
to be sufficient for the purposes of its instant inquiry."
559,5," Feesers has also provided some information regarding sales from other manufacturers, McCain, Schwan's, and Ecolab, to 
Sodexho, none of whom are parties in the instant action. In addition to the court's concern that such information goes beyond 
the scope of what is relevant to the dispute involving the instant defendants, is the fact that only limited information was 
available, which Dr. Larner admits in his initial report. For these reasons, and because the court is able to sufficiently address 
the relevant issues in the instant summary judgment motions without it, the court will not review the McCain, Schwan's, and 
Ecolab information here. "
560,6," Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act provides, in relevant part: (a) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them."
560,15, U.S.C. § 13(a). 
561,7," Michael Foods posits that its offer to extend the same deviated billback arrangement that Sysco receives to Feesers moots any 
issues regarding discrimination. Feesers counters that because Michael Foods' ""offer"" is not so expansive as to include all of 
Feesers' customers rather than simply those that are specifically considering Sodexho bids, it does not sufficiently eliminate 
discrimination. Moreover, Feesers argues that Michael Foods' unwillingness to make an identical offer or one that is 
contractually binding warrants concern that the offer constitutes conduct merely intended to forestall legal action which could be 
resumed when the threat of litigation has passed. See United States v. Oregon State Med. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S. Ct. 
690, 96 L. Ed. 978 (1952); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 48, 80 S. Ct. 503, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1960). The court 
agrees that the offer as described by Michael Foods might fail to address all circumstances in which price differences might exist 
and would not eliminate the risk of repeat conduct. Accordingly, the court finds that the offer to provide equivalent pricing in 
certain limited situations fails to moot the existence of price discrimination."
561,8," Feesers contends that at least some of its potential customers are also potential customers of Sodexho. If, as Feesers alleges, 
Michael Foods sells at more favorable prices to Sysco, who passes on those prices when it sells to Sodexho, who then also 
passes on the prices when it competes for customers with Feesers, the question of injury occurs at the third line of distribution 
from the seller. Thus, this is a case of third-line discrimination, also called tertiary discrimination. See 3-39 Antitrust Laws & 
Trade Reg. (MB) § 39.03 (2d ed. 2006)."
561,9," ""Legal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctions rather than actual market realities are generally disfavored in antitrust 
law. This Court has preferred to resolve antitrust claims on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the 'particular facts disclosed by 
the record.'"" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Svcs, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 466-67, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(1992). The Supreme Court advocated looking to the ""economic realities."" Id. at 467. Moreover, ""[a]ntitrust policy requires the 
courts to seek the economic substance of an arrangement, not merely its form."" Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 815 (3d 
Cir. 1984). "
562,10," Defendants also dispute whether Feesers and Sodexho are competitors. These arguments are more relevant to the issue of 
competitive injury, which the court addresses below; at this juncture, it is sufficient to say that the third-line injury model provides 
the appropriate framework for the court's review. The court will not reach the issue of whether Sodexho is a direct ""economic"" 
purchaser from Michael Foods."
562,11," Section 2(d) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the 
benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services 
or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of 
any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration 
is available on proportionally equal terms to all customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities."
562,15, U.S.C. § 13(d).
562,12," Michael Foods also discusses the possibility that §§ 2(c) and 2(e) of the Robinson Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13(c) and 13(e), 
are more applicable than § 2(a). "
563,13," Michael Foods raises the resale argument in connection with the question of whether Sodexho is a statutory purchaser. The 
court has already stated that it will not address the purchaser dispute, but interprets Michael Foods' resale argument as relevant 
within the context of whether, under a third-line injury model, the requisite goods of the same grade and quality are involved."
563,14," In reaching this conclusion, the court must resolve another of Michael Foods' challenges -- that Sodexho and its client form 
one economic unit. Again, Michael Foods makes this argument in connection with the purchaser dispute; however, it is also 
relevant to the resale issue. An underlying premise of Sodexho's ""single unit"" argument is that Sodexho cannot make a ""sale"" 
internally within one entity. The Sixth Circuit has held that there is no sale for Robinson-Patman purposes when a corporation "
564,," sells to its subsidiary. See Russ' Kwik Car Wash, Inc. v. Marathon Petroleum Co., 772 F.2d 214 (6th Cir. 1985) (relying upon the 
principle that because a corporation and its subsidiary have identical interests they are incapable of conspiring with each other in 
violation of antitrust laws, established by Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. 
Ed. 2d 628 (1984)). The court recognizes that on the surface there are a number of similarities between the instant facts and 
those of Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Express, Inc., 54 F.3d 1125 (3d Cir. 1995), which extended Copperweld to the 
relationship between a contract carrier and its agents. Here, a management company handles the day-to-day operations for its 
clients, is contractually obligated to manage the clients' affairs, and receives fees that are percentages of the clients' revenues 
from prepared food sales. See id. at 1135-35. However, the critical difference here is that the primary business of Sodexho's 
customers is not food service. Rather, they are institutional entities operating in completely unrelated fields; e.g. education, 
health care, senior care, etc. Therefore, the court does not agree that Sodexho's interests and those of its customers are 
identical, even though they may share some interests relating to the food service operations. The court will not consider 
Sodexho and its clients as single economic entities. "
565,15, Feesers compiled the list from a client report generated by Sodexho during discovery. 
566,16," Because the court finds that Feesers and Sodexho were not actually competitors within the meaning of § 2(a) of the Robinson-
Patman Act and, therefore, cannot establish competitive injury, the court will not reach the parties' other arguments regarding 
whether Feesers can establish competitive injury or whether Michael Foods has a valid meeting competition defense. "
570,1, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2003-04 version unless otherwise noted. 
571,2," The patent would have expired on December 9, 2003, but the Food and Drug Administration granted a six-month pediatric 
exclusivity extension to Bayer."
571,3," At the time the patent case was settled, Bayer was receiving revenue from Cipro of approximately $ 1 billion per year, and the 
patent term had nearly seven years before it expired. See In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 363 F. Supp. 2d 
514, 538 n.22 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). "
572,4," The appellants filed a notice to appeal the trial court's decision, but sought a stay of the appeal pending the Wisconsin 
Supreme Court's decision in Olstad v. Microsoft Corp., 2005 WI 121, 284 Wis. 2d 224, 700 N.W.2d 139."
572,5," Bayer also contends that two cases-Emergency One, Inc. v. Waterous Co., Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 959 (E.D. Wis. 1998) and 
Freeman Industries, LLC v. Eastman Chemical Co., 172 S.W.3d 512 (Tenn. 2005)-support its argument. These two cases, 
however, are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case. The facts alleged in the instant case involve in-state transactions 
by in-state residents. That was not the case for either Emergency One or Freeman Industries. "
593,1," Plaintiffs acknowledge that Count II mistakenly lists four Mates (Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania), and have 
offered to address this error by submitting a corrected complaint. More on this later. "
595,2," Further diminishing the weight of In re Vitamins is a recent Tennessee state court decision that presents an alternate 
interpretation of Tennessee law. In Freeman Indus. v. Eastman Chem. Co., 172 S.W.3d 512, 525 (Tenn. 2005), the court 
concluded that HN8[
] to recover under an unjust enrichment theory, the plaintiff ""need not establish that the defendant 
received a direct benefit from the plaintiff. Rather, a plaintiff may recover for unjust enrichment against a defendant who receives 
any benefit from the plaintiff if the defendant's retention of the benefit would be unjust."" "
597,3," Defendant again attacks what it labels plaintiffs' ""conclusory assertions"" made in a ""conclusory fashion,"" and for the reasons 
discussed above, particularly those in the context of Kolupa. defendant's arguments on this point fail. "
598,4," In support of its position that notice must be pled, defendant cites Hobbs v. GMC, 134 F. Supp. 2d 1277 (M.D. Ala. 2001), 
which applies the law of Alabama, a state not represented in Count IV. See id, at 1283 (""Under Alabama law, notice of breach is 
a condition precedent to bringing a breach of warranty action, which must be affirmatively pleaded in the complaint . . . No 
allegation of notice has been pled in this case.""). Similarly, Illinois, which is not represented in Count IV, also views notice as an 
element of a warranty claim. Industrial Hard Chrome, Ltd. v. Hetran, Inc., 64 F. Supp. 2d 741, 748 (N.D. Ill. 1999). "
600,5," Defendant attempts to minimize Strzakowlski by depicting its discussion of the complaint providing notice as dicta. In Cipollone 
v. Liggett Group, Inc., 683 F. Supp. 1487 (D. N.J. 1988), the case Strzakowlski expressly followed, the court rejected the 
defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of notice, on the ""alternative reasons"" that notice to a remote manufacturer was not 
required and that the complaint provided notice. With respect to the first reason for obviating the notice requirement, the court 
relied on Santor v. A & M Karagheusian, Inc., 44 N.J. 52, 207 A.2d 305 (N.J. 1965), in which the plaintiff gave notice of a defect 
to his immediate seller, but not to the defendant, a remote manufacturer. In Strzakowlski the plaintiffs failed to provide notice to 
either the remote manufacturer or its authorized dealers. Thus, if the court favored one of Cipollone's reasons over the other, the 
preferred rationale would be that of the sufficiency of the complaint. "
602,6," In order to be liable for the dealer's misrepresentations, the bank must have been a lessor of vehicles. Bescos, 129 Cal. Rptr. 
2d at 429. The court concluded that the bank was an assignee, rather than a lessor. Id. at 431. As an assignee, the bank could 
only be liable for defects on the face of the lease agreement. Id. at 429. "
603,7," We note that Bardin is the only published case that we have discovered that has applied Outboard Marine in this manner to a 
CLRA claim. "
604,8," In arriving at its definition of ""materiality."" Chamberlan. 369 F. Supp. 2d at 1144 borrowed from Mirkin v. Wasserman, 5 Cal. 4th 
1082, 1093, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101, 858 P.2d 568, (Cal. 1993), which discussed material omissions in the context of whether a 
plaintiff needed to prove actual reliance under California's law of deceit. We cannot determine with certainty whether the plaintiffs 
in Chamberlan claimed that defendant's fraud by omission violated the CLRA. The court did note that plaintiff's Unfair 
Competition Law claims were based on the underlying CLRA claims which focused on the defendant's unlawful, rather than 
fraudulent acts. Chamberlan, 369 F. Supp. 2d at 1146. However, in the ruling on class certification, the court noted that the 
""typicality requirement is satisfied because the named plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class 'all have claims arising 
from the same fraudulent scheme."" Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co., 223 F.R.D. 524, 526 (N.D. Cal. 2004)."
604,9, In Count V Fales seeks only injunctive relief. 
605,10," The amendment changed the final phrase of the paragraph, and replaced ""acting for the interests of itself, its members or the 
general public,"" with ""who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition."" Thus, 
the amendment limits representative actions to situations where the person bringing the suit suffers an injury and complies with 
section 382's class action procedures. Again, Fales brings the representative action under the CLRA, and reference to the UCL 
is made merely to illustrate the legislature's express authorization for private attorney general actions."
605,11," Representative actions and citizen-suits are typically brought under authorizing statutes. See generally Trevor W. Morrison, 
Private Attorneys General and the First Amendment, 103 MICH. L. REV. 589, 603 (2005); Jay L. Himes, Exploring the Antitrust 
Operating System: State Enforcement of Federal Antitrust Law in the Remedies Phase of the Microsoft Case, 11 GEO. 
MASON L. REV. 37, 65 n. 134 (2002). "
608,12," 2003 amendments added the quoted language, which replaced ""as soon as practicable after commencement of an action."" "
609,13," Plaintiffs submit that they will amend the class allegations in paragraph 96 so that the class includes ""all those who purchased 
or leased, a 1999 through 2002 mode year C/K series GMT800 platform vehicle equipped with an antilock brake (""ABS"") . . . and 
who experienced unwanted ABS activation while the Vehicle was traveling at a speed of greater than 3.6 mph but less than 10 
mph."" Defendant asserts that it would not object to an amended complaint at this stage. Reply at 3 n.4."
609,14," In addressing the actual damages component of his ICFA claim, Muehlbauer submits that the cost of repairing the defective 
Wheel Hub and ABS assembly is approximately $ 1,836 per vehicle. "
610,15," We emphasize that these observations as to the commonality of legal issues, like those as to the factual issues above and the 
single-state class claims below, rely on the limited material presented, consisting of the complaint, memoranda and exhibits. "
622,1," Although the statute does not bear a legislative title, the Supreme Court has referred to Business and Professions Code 
section 17200 et seq. most recently as the unfair competition law or UCL. (See  Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. 
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558 & fn. 2 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086] (Stop Youth Addiction).)"
622,2," Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. and Scott Lynch are separate parties. We refer to them throughout this opinion (as a matter of 
convenience) collectively as Lynch, and we will use the gender-neutral and singular “it” in referring to those parties."
622,3, All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise stated. 
623,4," The court rejected the demurring defendants' third argument because it found that Lynch's UCL claim against Paulus was 
“predicated upon his having allegedly committed ‘unlawful’ business practices,” while Paulus argued only that the first amended 
complaint failed to allege facts in support of the claim that Paulus committed “unfair” business practices under the UCL. The 
court thus found that Paulus had “failed [in his demurrer] to establish that [Lynch's] claim against him fails as a matter of law.”"
623,5," The second amended complaint alleged as a new count that the proposed Paulus/City development agreement was “a 
significant threat to competition between Lynch and Paulus.” The pleading also differed in that it deleted two of the counts 
alleged in the first amended complaint. The second amended complaint also contained a caption that differed from the first 
amended complaint (including a different title and the addition of numerous new parties [apparently all City officials]). Otherwise, 
the second amended complaint was substantially similar to the first amended complaint."
623,6," Before the demurrer to the second amended complaint was considered, Lynch sought a temporary restraining order to prevent 
establishment of the Dealership based upon the previously approved land-use applications. That application was denied by the 
court on or about November 21, 2003. "
624,7," Lynch filed a request for judicial notice in connection with its anti-SLAPP motion. The motion requested that the court take 
judicial notice of numerous pleadings (three volumes) filed in the prior suit. The court below granted the request for judicial 
notice. "
625,8," Lynch later amended its request, asking that the court award it $ 62,556 in attorney fees and $ 1,819.96 in costs."
625,9," Paulus raises for the first time in his reply brief the contentions that the motion to strike should have been denied to his claims 
for abuse of process and interference with contractual relations. As we will discuss (see pt. IV.B., post), Paulus forfeited these 
claims of error but, in any event, they are without merit. "
627,10," The Supreme Court explained that this standard was adapted from the related issue of determining whether an appeal is 
frivolous. ( Sheldon Appel, supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 885–886.) Under that test, an appeal is deemed to be frivolous only where "
628,," “any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.” ( In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 
31 Cal.3d 637, 650 [183 Cal. Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].)"
628,11," In the same vein, the Supreme Court has recently stated: “ HN8[
] ‘Probable cause may be present even where a suit lacks 
merit. Favorable termination of the suit often establishes lack of merit, yet the plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action must 
separately show lack of probable cause. Reasonable lawyers can differ, some seeing as meritless suits which others believe 
have merit, and some seeing as totally and completely without merit suits which others see as only marginally meritless. Suits 
which all reasonable lawyers agree totally lack merit—that is, those which lack probable cause—are the least meritorious of all 
meritless suits. Only this subgroup of meritless suits present[s] no probable cause.’ [Citations.]” ( Jarrow Formulas, supra, 31 
Cal.4th 728, 743, fn. 13, quoting   Roberts v. Sentry Life Insurance (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 375, 382 [90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 408].)"
628,12," In Albertson, the court noted that HN10[
] four instances demonstrating malice in a civil malicious prosecution case were 
where the prior suit was commenced (1) by a party who did not believe the claim to be valid; (2) chiefly as a result of hostility or 
ill will; (3) solely to deprive the party being sued of the beneficial use of that party's property; or (4) for the purpose of extracting a 
settlement bearing no relationship to the claim. ( Albertson v. Raboff, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 383.) "
629,13," California's electorate narrowed the scope of the UCL in 2004 by passing Proposition 64. Its intent was, inter alia, “to 
eliminate frivolous [UCL] lawsuits while protecting the right of individuals to retain an attorney and file an action for relief 
pursuant to Chapter 5” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 2004) text of Prop. 64, § 1(d), p. 109); “to prohibit private 
attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact under the standing 
requirements of the United States Constitution” (id., § 1(e)); and to provide “that only the California Attorney General and local 
public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public.” (id., § 1(f).) Proposition 64's provisions 
included—by amendment to Business and Professions Code section 17204—the elimination of the right of a person “acting for 
the interests of itself, its members or the general public” to bring a UCL suit, changing the language of the statute to read that a 
person could bring suit only if the person “has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair 
competition.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 2004) text of Prop. 64, § 3, p. 109.) The proposition took effect on 
“the day after the election unless the measure provides otherwise.” (Cal. Const. art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Since Proposition 64 
contained no specific provision for its effectiveness, it took effect on November 3, 2004. There is a present controversy—which 
is pending resolution by our Supreme Court—as to whether Proposition 64 has retroactive application to any case pending as of 
November 3, 2004. (Cf. Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn's, LLC,* (Cal.App.) review granted Apr. 27, 2005, S131798 
[First District Court of Appeal, Division Four, holding proposition not retroactive], with  Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn., † (Cal.App.) review granted Apr. 27, 2005, S132433 [Second District Court of Appeal, Division Five, holding proposition 
retroactive]). But since Lynch's UCL action was concluded in June 2004 with the Supreme Court's denial of Lynch's petition for 
review, the prior suit was therefore governed by Business and Professions Code section 17200 as it existed before the passage 
of Proposition 64. † Reporter's Note: for Supreme Court opinion, see 39 Cal.4th 235 [46 Cal. Rptr. 3d 66, 138 P.3d 214]."
629,*," Reporter's Note: For Supreme Court opinion, see 39 Cal.4th 223 [46 Cal. Rptr. 3d 57, 138 P.3d 207]. "
630,14," Prior to November 2004, the statute read as follows: “Actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted 
exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Attorney General or any district attorney or by any county counsel 
authorized by agreement with the district attorney in actions involving violation of a county ordinance, or any city attorney of a 
city, or city and county, having a population in excess of 750,000, and, with the consent of the district attorney, by a city 
prosecutor in any city having a full-time city prosecutor or, with the consent of the district attorney, by a city attorney in any city 
and county in the name of the people of the State of California upon their own complaint or upon the complaint of any board, 
officer, person, corporation or association or by any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public.” 
(Stats. 1993, ch. 926, § 2, pp. 5198–5199.) As we have noted (see fn. 13, ante), one of the chief results of the passage of 
Proposition 64 was the elimination of standing by a private UCL plaintiff except where that person has suffered direct injury as a 
result of the act of unfair competition complained of."
630,15," But see  Stop Youth Addiction, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pages 584–598, dissenting opinion of Justice Brown: “[A] judicial 
construction of [Business and Professions Code] section 17204 that confers universal citizen standing to enforce the UCL 
threatens the constitutional separation of powers.” ( Id. at p. 593 (dis. opn. of Brown, J.).) “[A] citizen suit under the UCL based 
upon [the ‘borrowed’ criminal statute] is not a private, civil analogue to a criminal prosecution. Instead, it is a kind of private 
usurpation of a criminal enforcement power conferred exclusively on a class of executive officers.” ( Id. at p. 594 (dis. opn. of 
Brown, J.).) "
631,16," Justice Kennard decried the Cel-Tech court's test for determining whether the conduct of a direct competitor to a plaintiff is 
“unfair” under the UCL as being vague and one that would “magnify the uncertainty that businesses face in trying to comply with 
the unfair competition law.” ( Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 192 (conc. & dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) “I can imagine no greater 
recipe for confusion and uncertainty than the majority's penumbral antitrust threat standard. It is difficult enough for courts and 
businesses alike to determine whether a business practice amounts to an actual violation of the antitrust laws prohibiting 
restraint of trade or exclusionary monopolistic conduct. A business seeking to guide its competitive conduct by the majority's 
standard will be put to the impossible task of deciding whether its conduct, even though not a violation of the antitrust laws, 
violates the ‘spirit’ of the antitrust laws or is an ‘incipient’ violation of those laws or is a threat to competition.” ( Id. at p. 200 
(conc. & dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) "
632,17," The Southwest Marine case involved a rather novel theory. There, the plaintiff—the defendant's competitor and an 
unsuccessful bidder on a Navy contract—alleged that the defendant had been awarded the Navy contract because he was able 
to submit a low bid solely because of his illegal (but economical) disposal of hazardous wastes. ( Southwest Marine, supra, 720 
F.Supp. at p. 808.) The court concluded that the plaintiff thereby stated a claim for relief under the UCL because it “fit[] within 
[the] historical conception of the law.” (Ibid.)"
632,18," Paulus makes much of the fact that Lynch brought the UCL action against the City and related City entities, which parties 
were clearly immune from suit. (See, e.g.,  People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. California Milk Producers Advisory 
Bd. (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 871 [22 Cal. Rptr. 3d 900];  Community Memorial Hosp. v. County of Ventura (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 
199, 209–211 [56 Cal. Rptr. 2d 732];  Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. v. Bluvshtein (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 308, 318 [281 Cal. 
Rptr. 298].) The fact that Lynch joined parties that were immune from suit has no bearing on whether the prior suit was 
objectively tenable as to Paulus (a private individual). "
633,19," We do not suggest that either  Hewlett, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th 499, or   Saunders v. Superior Court, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th 
832, may be considered to be definitive authority for the proposition that the allegations in Lynch's suit against Paulus 
established a claim under the UCL. Those cases are factually dissimilar from the case before us. Nonetheless, they may be 
relied upon as furnishing some basis for finding Lynch's claim to have been objectively tenable."
633,20," In an oft-quoted passage (see, e.g.,  Ford Dealers Assn. v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1982) 32 Cal.3d 347, 368–369 
[185 Cal. Rptr. 453, 650 P.2d 328]), an appellate court over four decades ago explained the breadth of the “unfair” prong of the 
UCL as follows: “[I]t would be impossible to draft in advance detailed plans and specifications of all acts and conduct to be 
prohibited [citations], since unfair or fraudulent business practices may run the gamut of human ingenuity and chicanery.” ( 
People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. of Cal. (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 765, 772 [20 Cal. Rptr. 516].) "
634,21," Paulus also cites  State of California v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal.3d 237 [115 Cal. Rptr. 497, 524 P.2d 1281], and  City of 
Santee v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 713 [279 Cal. Rptr. 22], in support of the assertion that Lynch's prior suit was 
not objectively tenable. But like  Saad, supra, 24 Cal.App.4th 1206, these cases merely held that administrative mandamus, not 
declaratory relief, is the appropriate remedy for a party aggrieved by an administrative decision. Neither case involved a UCL 
claim asserted by a third party. Accordingly, these cases did not preclude the filing of the prior suit."
634,22," Our conclusion rejecting Paulus's contention that Lynch lacked probable cause to bring the prior UCL suit does not imply a 
view that the acts and practices alleged in the prior suit, if proved, constituted unfair competition under the UCL. Under the 
“rather lenient standard” of probable cause, we simply conclude here that Lynch's prior suit met the threshold of a successful 
defense against a malicious prosecution claim, i.e., that it was not a suit that “ ‘all reasonable lawyers agree totally lack[ed] 
merit.’ ” ( Jarrow Formulas, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 743, fn. 13.)"
634,23," Because we find that Paulus did not meet his burden of establishing that he would probably prevail on the merits (in that the 
element of the absence of probable cause is found wanting), we need not examine whether Paulus presented sufficient 
evidence of malice to support his malicious prosecution claim. (See   Hiser v. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 
640, 655 [4 Cal. Rptr. 3d 249].) "
635,24," In so holding, we do not mean to imply that Paulus's contentions—were we not to find them forfeited—have any merit. In 
opposing the anti-SLAPP motion, Paulus was required both to plead a legally sufficient cause of action and to make a prima 
facie showing of facts by admissible evidence sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. ( 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Steinberg 
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 568, 584 [132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 789].) As to the abuse of process and interference with contract claims, he 
did neither. (See  Vogel v. Felice (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1006 [26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350] [finding that the plaintiff opposing anti-
SLAPP motion neither pleaded nor established by admissible evidence valid defamation claim].) The abuse of process claim 
clearly appears to have been barred. (See  Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss & Karma, Inc. (1986) 42 
Cal.3d 1157, 1168–1169 [232 Cal. Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202] [abuse of process does not lie for filing and maintenance of prior 
lawsuit, even if done for an improper purpose].) Likewise, the interference with contract claim appears barred by the litigation 
privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b). ( Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1202–1203 [litigation privilege 
rendered the defendants' conduct “absolutely immune from civil tort liability, including plaintiff's interference with contract and 
related claims”]; see also  Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048 [39 Cal. Rptr. 3d 516, 128 P.3d 713].)"
635,25," Paulus's record designation did not include the reporter's transcript from the hearing on that motion for attorney fees. 
Accordingly, the record on appeal does not include this transcript. (See  Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295–1296 
[240 Cal. Rptr. 872, 743 P.2d 932] [burden on party challenging attorney fee award to provide adequate record on appeal in 
order to assess claim of error].) "
636,26," Paulus argues in his reply brief—based on the assumption that the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion must be reversed 
as to the malicious prosecution claim—that the attorney fee award should be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court 
to assess the amount of fees incurred by Lynch solely in connection with moving to strike the abuse of process and interference 
with contract claims. Because we have concluded that the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion should be affirmed as to all 
three causes of action of Paulus's complaint, we obviously reject this untimely contention. "
639,1," The only paragraph in the original complaint concerning Erin Keyes reads as follows: Keyes and his wife, Erin, are residents of the State of Utah and, on information and belief, were at all relevant times herein 
husband and wife. Accordingly, this action is brought against them and their marital community, as the actions taken by 
Keyes were done for the benefit of and in furtherance of his marital community. Compl. (doc. # 1, pt. 2) P 4."
639,2," In an apparent effort to evade dismissal on the bases set forth in Defendants' motion to dismiss (doc. # 5), Plaintiffs have filed 
an amended complaint (doc. # 16). In their response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs claim that the amended 
complaint does not name Erin Keyes as a party, thereby mooting her motion. See Resp. (doc. # 15) at 1-2. As Defendants point 
out, however, the amended complaint (doc. # 16) names ""Jane Doe Keyes"" instead. Reply (doc. # 19) at 2 n.1. Accordingly, 
Defendants seek clarification that Erin Keyes will be dropped as a party, and the Court rules on her motion on that basis. As the claims in the complaint and amended complaint against the remaining defendants are essentially the same, the analysis 
would be the same whether directed to the complaint or amended complaint. "
641,3," Although The Bremen involved an international forum selection clause in a commercial contract, the Ninth Circuit has approved 
The Bremen framework for domestic forum selection clauses and employment contracts. See Spradlin v. Lear Siegler Mgmt. 
Servs. Co., 926 F.2d 865, 867-68 (9th Cir. 1991) (employment contract); Pelleport Investors, Inc. v. Budco Quality Theatres, 
Inc., 741 F.2d 273, 279 (9th Cir. 1984) (domestic forum selection clause)."
641,4," The Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs' briefs occasionally refer to the ""overbroad and otherwise unlawful non-compete 
clauses."" See, e.g., Reply (doc. # 21) at 12. These unelaborated characterizations made in passing are insufficient to overcome 
the presumption of validity established by The Bremen."
641,5," Although Mediterranean Enterprises dealt with the interpretation of an arbitration clause, the Ninth Circuit has explained that 
the guidance of such cases is equally applicable to the interpretation of a forum selection clause, because an arbitration clause 
is simply a specific type of forum selection clause. Manetti-Farrow, Inc., 858 F.2d at 514 n.4 (citing Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 
417 U.S. 506, 517, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1974))."
641,6," At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel argued that Siren cannot be bound by the forum selection clause because it was never a 
party to the VP Agreement. Counsel also suggested that Manetti-Farrow is distinguishable in that it extended the reach of the 
forum selection clause only to defendants who had not signed the contract. The Court disagrees. There is nothing in the Ninth 
Circuit's Manetti-Farrow decision to believe that the court intended such a narrow and imbalanced rule. Defendants assertion that Kilgore has breached his obligations under the non-compete and non-solicitation covenants of the VP 
Agreement is plainly traceable to Siren's conduct in hiring former Firstline employees, recruiting in Tempe and Mesa, and 
entering the Cleveland, Columbus, and Indiana markets. Kilgore is Siren's sole owner. Kilgore Aff. PP 2-3. It is inescapable to 
conclude that Siren's conduct is so closely intertwined with Kilgore's contractual relationship with Firstline that the forum 
selection clause must apply as equally to Siren as it would to Kilgore. See Manetti-Farrow, Inc., 858 F.2d at 514 n.5. "
642,7," Plaintiffs maintain that the standard of liability for abuse of process is much less stringent than the manner in which it is 
presented by Defendants. Compare Pls.' Resp. (doc. # 15) (plaintiff must show that defendant used process primarily for 
purpose other than that for which it was intended) (citation omitted) with Defs.' Resp. (doc. # 14) (plaintiff must additionally show 
that action ""could not logically be explained without reference to the defendants' improper motives"") (citation omitted). The 
disagreement over the appropriate standard is of no consequence to the resolution of the pending Rule 12(b)(3) motion. 
Dismissal must follow even under Plaintiffs' formulation, because resolution of the abuse of process claim will inevitably require 
some inquiry into Kilgore's alleged breach of the VP Agreement to determine whether Defendants were pursuing the Utah action 
primarily for an improper purpose. "
643,8," Plaintiffs ask rhetorically ""when, in Defendants' view, would their tortious and illegal conduct be sufficient to subject them to 
sanctions from a court in Arizona? Would Defendants have to be tried criminally in Utah if they chose to burn down Siren's 
offices in Arizona or committed battery on Kilgore to keep him from doing business in security systems' sales."" Resp. (doc. # 15) 
at 5. This was asked again at oral argument. Instead of asking questions to define the outer limits of acceptable conduct under 
the privilege of competition, greater attention could be paid to answering the question of whether Defendants' actual conduct 
was privileged. Arguments based on egregious factual scenarios tend not to illuminate arguments based on facts in issue. "
644,9," In Three Phoenix, the Supreme Court of Arizona acknowledged Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1402 as the state counterpart to section 1 
of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, making its holding in the context of the federal statute equally applicable to the resolution of 
claims brought under the state statute. See Three Phoenix Co., 659 P.2d at 1260."
644,10," Federal court interpretations of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., may be used as a guide in construing Arizona's 
Uniform State Antitrust Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1401, et seq. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1412 (West 2003) ("". . . Courts may use as a 
guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust statutes.""); see also Johnson v. Pac. Lighting 
Land Co., 817 F.2d 601, 604 (9th Cir. 1987) (construing Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1402 in light of federal court decisions). 
Copperweld and Freeman are particularly appropriate guides in this case because the Supreme Court of Arizona has specifically 
recognized Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1402 as the Arizona counterpart to 15 U.S.C. § 1, the federal statute upon which those cases 
were based. See Three Phoenix Co., 659 P.2d at 1260. Plaintiffs cite to the decision of the Court of Appeals of Arizona in Bunker's Glass Co. v. Pilkington PLC, 202 Ariz. 481, 47 P.3d 
1119 (Ct. App. 2002), for the proposition that state public policy concerns may override persuasive federal court authority in 
antitrust matters. Reply (doc. # 21) at 12. In Bunker's Glass the court merely observed that public policy favors recognition of an 
indirect purchaser's standing to sue under state antitrust laws, notwithstanding the contrary position taken by the Supreme Court 
with respect to claims brought under the Sherman Act. See Bunker's Glass Co., 47 P.3d at 1123-30. However, Plaintiff does not 
cite any Arizona authority that would support deviation from the ""single entity"" rule of Copperweld. Moreover, Plaintiffs' vague 
and belated references to Defendants' arrangements with third parties, Reply (doc. # 21) at 13, are without support from the 
amended complaint, Am. Compl. (doc. # 16). "
647,1," The forum selection clause in Stephens v. Entre Computer Ctrs., Inc., 696 F. Supp. 636 (N.D. Ga. 1988), provided: ""The parties 
agree that any action brought by either party in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the Commonwealth of 
Virginia and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purposes of carrying out this provision."" 696 
F. Supp. 2d at 638. The court noted that the clause should be construed broadly because it referenced ""any action"" and did not 
""explicitly limit the actions to ones arising under or in connection with the contract."" Id. The clause in the present case, which 
references ""any lawsuit"" and which does not limit the applicable actions. should be afforded a similarly broad construction. "
648,2," ""If forum selection clauses are to be enforced as a matter of public policy, that same public policy requires that they not be 
defeated by artful pleading of claims …."" Coastal Steel Corp. v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., 709 F.2d 190, 203 (3d Cir. 1983), 
cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 349, 78 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1983) (""[W]here the relationship between the parties is contractual, 
the pleading of alternative non-contractual theories of liability should not prevent enforcement"" of a forum selection clause.)."
648,3," In Digital Envoy, Inc., Plaintiff argued that its claims were not covered by the forum selection clause because the claims were 
independent of the parties' contract and would exist even if there was no agreement between the parties. Digital Envoy, Inc., 319 
F. Supp. 2d at 1380. The court rejected this argument, reasoning that a central issue in the case was whether the parties' 
contract applied to Plaintiff's claims. Id. Similarly, in this case, Plaintiff argues that its claims are not subject to the forum 
selection clause because resolution of the claims does not require reference to or construction of the Agreement. This argument 
is without merit. Although Plaintiff has not alleged breach of the written Agreement, analysis of its claims requires reference to 
and construction of the contractual relationship between the parties as evidenced by the Agreement. See Stewart Org., Inc., 810 
F.2d at 1070."
648,4," 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) provides: ""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may 
transfer any civil action lo any other district or division where it might have been brought."" "
649,5," Plaintiff argues that the case should remain in this forum because Defendant traveled to Florida to establish the contractual 
relationship, the relevant acts and omissions occurred in Florida, and Florida residents have an interest in seeing that violations 
of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices laws are redressed. These considerations, even if valid, are not sufficient to 
overcome the forum selection clause. See In re Ricoh Corp., 870 F.2d at 573-74. Moreover, based on this Courts interpretation 
of the forum selection clause, Ohio law may apply to some or all of Plaintiff's claims."
649,6," Like many cases involving choice of forum clauses, resolution of the motion to transfer presents a close call. Notwithstanding, 
transfer of this case is consistent with well-settled Eleventh Circuit precedent, as cited herein. "
653,*," The Honorable Harold A. Ackerman, Senior District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation. "
654,1," Stark's first amended complaint pursued some 17 federal and state causes of action, including claims under both Section 1 
(restraint of trade) and Section 2 (monopolization) of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.; claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 
1983, 1985, and Title IX; and state law claims of defamation, civil assault, civil battery, interference with contractual relations, 
and interference with prospective contractual relations. The District Court dismissed the Section 1 claim, as well as the § 1981, § 
1985, and Title IX claims, in an oral Order on June 21, 2004. Stark then withdrew her § 1981 claim. Stark's second amended 
complaint pursues some 11 causes of action, only one of which is federal, the Section 2 claim that the District Court dismissed in 
a written Order dated March 31, 2005. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), the District Court then dismissed Stark's pendant 
state law claims without prejudice. On appeal, Stark challenges only the dismissal of her Section 1 and Section 2 claims. "
670,1," The contract between the Gregorys and the State of Wyoming--which was later apparently assigned to the Fort Bridger 
Historical Association--expired in 2001. The Gregorys chose not to renew the contract."
670,2," The trade committee enforced the policy related to unauthentic goods by visiting traders' tents during the Rendezvous and 
inspecting the items they had for sale. If one of the committee members noticed an unauthentic good, the trader was asked to 
put the good away. The record reveals that, on average, the Gregorys were asked to put away approximately one item per year 
due to its lack of authenticity."
670,3," In 2002, the State of Wyoming was engaged in an archeological project to uncover the foundations of several historical 
buildings on the Fort Bridger Historical Site. When the foundations were discovered, the State prohibited that space from being 
used for Rendezvous trading. Because of this prohibition, two spaces would be lost on the front row of the Rendezvous. Rather 
than oust a trader from the space altogether, the FBRA's Board adopted a policy limiting each trader to one space on the front 
row. The policy affected one trader, and would have affected the Gregorys if they had traded at the 2002 Rendezvous."
670,4," These latter two proposals were not implemented. The Gregorys also complain of other conduct taken by the FBRA that is not 
supported by the record. "
671,5," It is not clear what precipitated the rejection of the Gregorys' application, although it seems to be based on another complaint 
lodged by Ms. Gregory in response to the Board's decision to permit only one front row space per trader. The letter, which was 
addressed to the Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources, accused the FBRA of sex discrimination and unethical business 
practices."
671,6," Over the years, other traders' timely applications for space at the Rendezvous were denied because, for example, the 
proprietors refused to comply with the requirement that they dress in period attire or because they sold goods that did not 
comport with the pre-1840 standard. The ban from trading is not a permanent ban, however, as traders are permitted to reapply 
for space the following year. It does not appear from the record that the Gregorys ever reapplied for space at the Rendezvous 
after their 2002 application was denied. "
672,7," Congress explicitly exempted agricultural cooperatives from the provisions of the Sherman Act. See 7 U.S.C. § 291; 15 U.S.C. 
§ 17. There are several limited exceptions to this immunity, however, that place cooperatives outside the protection of the 
Capper-Volstead Acts. For example, ""agreements with persons not engaged in agricultural production, particularly for the 
purpose of acquiring monopoly power,"" are not exempted. Bell, 348 F.3d at 1232. ""Similarly, the association may not engage in 
predatory tactics such as picketing and harassment, coerced membership and discriminatory pricing."" Id. "
673,8," Fur Breeders argued that the independent stakeholder exemption did not apply to cooperatives, instead maintaining that 
individual members of the agricultural cooperative were exempt from liability under the antitrust laws because the cooperative 
itself was exempt from the antitrust laws. Bell, 348 F.3d at 1233 n.5. The court did not address this argument because it ""easily 
resolve[d] [the] issue applying the independent stakeholder exemption."" Id. "
675,9," Indeed, as noted above, prior to the 2002 Rendezvous, the Gregorys sold many of the same goods that they sold at the 
Rendezvous at the trading post which was immediately adjacent to the Rendenzvous."
675,10," HN14[
] Our inquiry into whether the challenged action warrants per se or rule of reason treatment does not include an 
inquiry into the specific motive of the alleged conspirators. Rather, we look to the type of action involved to determine whether it 
has such a pernicious effect on competition such that per se analysis is warranted. Whether the conspirators' justification for its 
conduct is pretextual--as the Gregorys allege here--is properly considered under the rule of reason analysis. See Northwest 
Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 296 n.7 (stating that actions that are not substantially related to the asserted procompetitive purpose 
might warrant an inference of anticompetitive animus). "
678,1," At trial, Brooke testified that he did not sign an employment agreement. On appeal, he concedes that he signed an employment 
agreement with a confidentiality provision."
678,2," The court later sought clarification of Brooke's testimony in this regard: ""The Court: So it's your testimony that Mr. Bailey agreed 
that you could take 35 percent of the parts department business with you when you left. That's your contention. [P] [Mr. Brooke]: 
My contention is he said I could take the strapping business because he was not comfortable with the high invoices, and I would 
only speculate that he wasn't comfortable with the business not knowing exactly what took place. [P] The Court: You agree that 
there was a parts manager that was being trained to replace you. [P] [Mr. Brooke]: That's correct . . . ."" "
680,3," In his reply brief, Brooke argues that the court erred in considering the February agreement in conjunction with the preexisting 
obligations of the parties. A contract, however, ""may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made, 
and the matter to which it relates."" (Civ. Code, § 1647.) We perceive no error in the court's consideration of the existing 
agreements between the parties in interpreting the February agreement. "
689,1," The portion of the Answer containing the Counterclaims is referred to hereinafter as ""Counterclaims."""
689,2," For the purposes of Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss, the Court has accepted all factual allegations plead in Defendants' 
Counterclaims as true. In addition to facts alleged in the Counterclaims, the Court has considered Defendants' Answer, which 
Defendants expressly incorporated into their Counterclaims, see Counterclaims at 16, together with the employment contracts 
attached as Exhibits A-H to Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, docket no. 7, and the ""Executive Summary"" attached as Exhibit N to 
Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. The Court DENIES Defendants' Motion to Strike, docket no. 18, at 23, because the Court does 
not strike arguments made in a party's briefing. Nonetheless, the Court makes clear that, for the purposes of this motion, the 
Court does not take Plaintiffs' allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, docket no. 7, as true. The parties dispute whether 
Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss relies on facts outside of the pleadings and whether the motion must be converted to one for 
summary judgment. The Court declines to convert the motion to a summary judgment motion."

'wholly unilateral,'"" Defendants argue that Plaintiffs ""acquired competitor businesses as part of an anti-competitive scheme."" 
Defs.' Resp., docket no. 18, at 11-12. Plaintiffs' alleged acquisitions, set forth in Counterclaims P 17, have nothing to do with the 
""non-compete agreements."" Nor have Defendants alleged that Plaintiffs' acquisitions constitute a Section 1 conspiracy between 
Fiserv/NFS and other companies to carry out anticompetitive goals."

693,," Plaintiffs also argue that NFS cannot conspire with Fiserv because NFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fiserv. Pls.' Mot. at 8. 
While this is true, see Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771, Defendants' Counterclaim I does not allege a conspiracy between NFS and 
Fiserv. See Counterclaims PP 36-42; Defs.' Resp. at 12."

694,10," The Court does not decide whether Defendants have sufficiently alleged the other elements of a Section 1 Sherman Act 
violation; however, the Defendants' failure to plead ""antitrust injury,"" as the Court discusses in the context of Defendants' Section

710,8," As with Teva's claims, all of the Sherman Act claims in Impax's antitrust counterclaims are also asserted to be a basis for relief 
under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. (See C.A. 03-120, D.I. 289 at PP 149, 154, 159, 165.)"
710,9," Those states are Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (C.A. 05-360, D.I. 24 at P 112.) "
711,10," In their arguments concerning antitrust liability, Defendants do not separately address the claims under different statutory 
sections, e.g., Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act. For example, while the cases that Defendants rely on discuss liability 
under Section 2, Defendants apparently intend their arguments concerning the legality of their conduct to apply equally to the 
Section 1 claims. (D.I. 384 at 17 (""For all these reasons, Plaintiffs' allegations relating to the introduction of new products and 
discontinuance of old products, do not state a claim under Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act."").) For purposes of this Motion, I 
will address Defendants' arguments as they have been framed, and I will not separately discuss the different statutory claims. "
712,11," I note that one of the authors of IP & Antitrust, Mark A. Lemley, represents Impax in this matter. "
713,12," I note the importance of the screening function that is carried out by the need for the antitrust plaintiff to show monopoly 
power. Only a manufacturer with monopoly power will be subject to the scrutiny under Section 2 discussed here. See United 
States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 186 (3d Cir. 2005); Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 50-51. Defendants do not argue, for 
purposes of this Motion, that they lack the requisite monopoly power. "
714,13," Defendants also argue (D.I. 384 at 25-26) that Teva's claim that patents were wrongfully listed in the Orange Book (D.I. 360, 
Ex. A at PP 183-205, 335-43) must be dismissed. Teva has agreed to drop that claim. (D.I. 404 at 48 n.16.) "
715,14," The pertinent allegations of Impax in support of its claim of an overall anticompetitive scheme are discussed separately, infra 
Section IV.C. "
717,15," ""[W]hether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to 
be decided as a question of Federal Circuit law."" Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1068."
717,16," While the difference between Walker Process and sham litigation liability may be ""somewhat elusive,"" Areeda P 706a, at 187, 
a patentee might use a fraudulently obtained patent in an anticompetitive way without litigation, or conversely, the patentee may 
bring litigation that is objectively baseless for reasons other than fraud, including inequitable conduct. Id. at 187-88. "
719,17,"  If the antitrust plaintiff can prove the existence of sham litigation, the litigation conduct can be included in the mix of things 
alleged to violate the antitrust laws. If not, the antitrust claim can still be heard on the merits, but without the sham litigation 
allegations. In this way, courts avoid the risk of such mixed allegations being used as a subterfuge to avoid the stringent 
requirements of Walker Process or Noerr immunity. IP & Antitrust § 11.4f."
719,18," That assertion, made by Impax in opposition to this Motion, is joined by Teva. (D.I. 404 at 2 n.1.) "
720,19," Attorneys' fees resulting from the addition of the '881 suit may also be an appropriate antitrust injury, although that proposition 
appears to be controversial. Compare Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Lab., 90 F. Supp. 2d 540, 543-46 (D.N.J. 2000) 
(fees may be antitrust injury) with Brotech Corp. v. White Eagle Int'l Techs. Group, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21073, No. 
Civ.A.03-232, 2004 WL 1427136, at *6-*7 (E.D. Pa. June 21, 2004) (fees alone are not antitrust injury). Because the delayed 
market entry is sufficient injury, I need not decide, for purposes of this Motion, whether attorneys' fees are also an antitrust injury."
720,20," Defendants argue (D.I. 384 at 28) that Impax has also failed to plead antitrust injury from a free-standing Walker Process 
claim, but, as Impax correctly points out (C.A. 03-120, D.I. 313 at 7), it does not make such a claim. "
721,21," Abbott alternatively argues that the allegations be stricken pursuant to Rule 12(f) as to Abbott. (D.I. 384 at 36.) Rule 12(f) 
motions to strike are ""not favored and usually will be denied unless the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy 
and may cause prejudice to one of the parties or if the allegations confuse the issues. . . . It is thus a drastic remedy to be 
resorted to only when required for the interests of justice."" Plaum v. Jefferson Pilot Fin. Ins. Co., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28968, 
No. Civ.A.04-4597, 2004 WL 2980415, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 22, 2004). For the Walker Process claim, the pleadings adequately 
support the claim and will not be stricken. I will also not strike the Direct Purchasers' inequitable conduct allegation, because it is 
fairly read to support the claim against Abbott."
721,22," Fournier also moves alternatively for allegations to be stricken pursuant to Rule 12(f). Because the allegations support the 
antitrust claims against Fournier, I will not strike any of those allegations. See supra note 21. "
737,1," Specifically, the settled actions are those incorporated in Plaintiffs' Master Complaint filed on March 8, 2002."

790,4," Indirect purchasers may sue for injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. See In re Warfarin Sodium 
Antitrust Litig., 214 F.3d 395, 399-400 (3d Cir. 2000); Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Cont'l Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 594 (3d 
Cir. 1979). "
791,5," Although a plaintiff could still bring a claim in state court under the state antitrust statute, the possible foreclosure of access to 
federal courts for plaintiffs bringing state antitrust claims defeats the goals of diversity jurisdiction in the antitrust context."
791,6," Charles Wright and Arthur Miller emphasize the possible tension between prudential considerations of standing under federal 
law and the conceptualization of standing to enforce a state right under state law: If a clear case should appear in which standing would be recognized by state rules but denied by prudential federal rules, 
the federal court would have to choose between the general obligation to exercise diversity jurisdiction and its doubts as to 
the wisdom of enforcing this state claim of this particular plaintiff. It does not seem likely that the same choice should be 
made for all cases. It might be appropriate to deny standing on the basis of strong prudential objections, particularly if the 
interests pursued by the plaintiff seem remote and the substantive issues are sensitive. On the other hand, state standing 
might well be honored if there is a reasonable ground for seeking decision and the prudential objections are relatively weak. Id. at 90-91. "
792,7," This distinction is explicit under federal law. See Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 476, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. 
Ed. 2d 149 (1982); Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 728 n. 7. There is nonetheless considerable overlap between these two issues, as 
both help define the question of who may sue under federal antitrust law and as similar considerations guide their resolution. "
793,8," The Pilkington Court acknowledged that although federal law treats the question of whether a particular class of plaintiffs can 
be deemed, at the outset of litigation, not to suffer an antitrust injury as analytically distinct from the question of the remoteness 
of a particular injury, both questions implicate principles of standing. See Pilkington, 75 P.3d at 106 n. 8, 110. "
800,9," For instance, HN35[
] the AAA expressly permits a person ""injured in his business or property"" to ""bring an action for appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief. . ."" Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1408(B)."
800,10," The analyses in these cases hinge on the absence of any impoverishment, as compared to the lack of a direct enrichment. 
See, e.g., Stapley v. American Bathtub Liners, 162 Ariz. 564, 785 P.2d 84, 88 (Ariz. App. Ct. 1989) (reversing jury verdict for 
vendor of property on unjust enrichment claim against purchaser who possessed property prior to closing with legal consent of 
vendors, but who never paid rent, because no showing of impoverishment and because whatever benefit attached to purchaser 
was presumably included in purchaser price of property); Sierra Vista v. Cochise Enters., 144 Ariz. 375, 697 P.2d 1125, 1131 
(Ariz. App. Ct. 1984) (finding quantum meruit claim waived because appellants' never raised theory of liability prior to or during 
trial and noting in dicta that quantum meruit claim would fail because no impoverishment). "
801,11," The Third Circuit has noted that HN37[
] a price-fixing conspiracy among manufacturers of a product would not exist if there 
was no ultimate consumer of the product, regardless of the various links of middlemen. See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust 
Litig., 214 F.3d at 401."
801,12," These cases simply do not address this issue. See In re Estate of Elliott, 149 Vt. 248, 542 A.2d 282, 285 (Vt. 1988) (affirming 
denial of unjust enrichment claim due to creditors' failure to introduce evidence of estate's receipt of ""any benefit"" of creditors' 
services); Land Inv., Inc. v. Battleground Assoc., 138 Vt. 316, 415 A.2d 753, 759 (Vt. 1980) (denying unjust enrichment claim 
without analysis because claim premised on impermissible legal contention that ""one who borrows money to purchase real 
estate and defaults in the loan obligation unjustly enriches the seller at the expense of the lender""). "
802,13," The Court finds that HN40[
] the ""exhaustion of remedies"" requirement to an unjust enrichment claim under Tennessee law 
makes little sense in this context unless a party is required to take such remedial steps prior to filing suit against the parties with 
whom the prospective plaintiff lacks a direct relationship. See, e.g., AmSouth Erectors, L.L.C. v. Skaggs Iron Works, Inc., 2003 
Tenn. App. LEXIS 551 at *19, 2003 WL 21878640, at *6 (Tenn. Super. Ct. Aug. 5, 2003) (purpose of exhaustion of remedies 
requirement is to ""winnow out claims that are not ripe for adjudication""); Window Gallery v. Davis, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 775, 
1999 WL 1068730, at *4 (Tenn. Super. Ct. Nov. 24, 1999) (retail seller of windows must exhaust remedies against defendant 
contractor, to whom seller furnished windows, before ""proceed[ing]"" against homeowner under theory of unjust enrichment). "
806,1," The Court received a letter from Plaintiffs' counsel dated June 30, 2005. The Court did not consider this letter in deciding this 
motion because the communication did not constitute a proper pleading."
806,2, The Smith Estate was Plaintiff in Civil Action No. 04-2930-DV prior to consolidation.
806,3," Each plaintiff filed individually and on behalf of a class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a),(b)(2)-(3)."
806,4, The facts are taken from the complaint and presumed to be true for the instant motion only. 
824,1," Respondent also alleges that petitioners injured its business through a violation of § 1962(a), although the parties dedicate little 
attention to this issue.  In light of the Court's disposition of the § 1962(c) claim and the limited discussion of § 1962(a) by the 
parties, I agree with the Court that we should give the Court of Appeals the first opportunity to reconsider the § 1962(a) claim.  
Accordingly, I join Part III of the Court's opinion. "
825,2," Sutherland's treatise on damages, on which the Court relied in Holmes, labels the same type of claims indirect: those where 
one party is injured, and it is that very injury--and not the wrongful behavior by the tortfeasor--that causes the injury to the 
plaintiff.  See 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland).  Indeed, every example cited in Sutherland in 
illustration of this principle parallels Holmes; the plaintiff would not be injured absent the injury to another victim.  See Sutherland 
55-56. "
826,3," Indeed, in Associated General Contractors, we did not even squarely hold that the reason that indirect damages are not 
compensable was that the damages were not easily ascertainable; instead, we merely recognized the empirical fact that ""[p]artly 
because it is indirect, and partly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been produced by independent factors, the 
Union's damages claim is also highly speculative.""  459 U.S., at 542, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723."
826,4," Sutherland described the interrelation between the two concepts: ""A fatal uncertainty may infect a case where an injury is easily 
provable, but the alleged responsible cause cannot be sufficiently established as to the whole or some part of that injury.  So it 
may exist where a known and provable wrong or violation of contract appears, but the alleged loss or injury as a result of it 
cannot be certainly shown."" Sutherland 94."
826,5," Nor is it fair to require a plaintiff to prove that the tort caused the lowering of prices at the motion to dismiss stage.  Ideal's 
complaint alleges that petitioners ""pass on to National's customers the sales tax 'savings' that National realizes as a result of its 
false returns."" App. 16.  This allegation that, as a factual matter, National was able to charge a lower price after tax because of 
its fraud suffices to permit Ideal to survive a motion to dismiss on the question whether the prices were lowered due to the fraud, 
as opposed to other factors. "
827,6," Prosser and Keeton appear to use ""direct"" in a broader sense than that adopted by the Court in Holmes. See Prosser & Keeton 
§ 43, at 273, 293-297. "
828,7," See Rehnquist, Remarks of the Chief Justice, 21 St. Mary's L. J. 5, 13 (1989) (""I think that the time has arrived for Congress to 
enact amendments to civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are connected to organized crime, or have some 
other reason for being in federal court""); Sentelle, Civil RICO: The Judges' Perspective, and Some Notes on Practice for North 
Carolina Lawyers, 12 Campbell L. Rev. 145, 148 (1990) (""[E]very single district judge with whom I have discussed the subject 
(and I'm talking in the dozens of district judges from across the country) echoes the entreaty expressed in the Chief Justice's title 
in The Wall Street Journal[, Get RICO Cases Out of My Courtroom, May 19, 1989, p A14, col. 4]""). "
829,8," The honest businessman would likewise fail Justice Scalia's theory of proximate causation, because laws against threats of 
violence are intended to protect those who are so threatened, not other parties that might suffer as a consequence.  Ante, at 
462, 164 L. Ed. 2d, at 732 (concurring opinion). "
846,1," Defendants are Micron Technology, Inc.; Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc.; Crucial Technology, Inc.; Infineon Technologies 
AG; Infineon Technologies North America Corp.; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.; Mosel Vitelic 
Corporation; Mosel Vitelic Corporation (USA); Nanya Technology Corporation; Nanya Technology Corporation USA; Winbond 
Electronics Corporation; Winbond Electronics Corporation America; Elpida Memory, Inc.; Elpida Memory (USA), Inc.; and NEC 
Electronics America, Inc. (collectively ""defendants""). Of these, all except for the Infineon, Samsung, and Hynix entity defendants, 
who have entered into settlements with plaintiffs, jointly oppose the instant motion. "
853,2," Defendants in part argue that a class action is not superior to other available methods because the larger sophisticated 
purchasers of DRAM -- such as the major PC and Server OEMs -- could easily maintain their own independent actions against 
defendants. This argument, however, fails to take into account the fact that smaller purchasers, who might form a large part of 
the proposed plaintiff class, could not easily defend their interests in separate actions, and would accordingly suffer prejudice. 
For this reason, the argument is rejected as a basis for denying the motion for class certification. "
860,1," ""Realtors Associations"" are organizations affiliated with the National Association of Realtors and have agreed to abide by the 
NAR Code of Ethics. RASCW is an example of a local Realtors Association. "
862,2," We agree with our concurring colleague that a cautious approach is always appropriate when anticipating future Supreme 
Court actions. In 1985, our Circuit began to incorporate the rule of reason in our tying analysis. At that time, we stated that, 
""According to the Supreme Court, a plaintiff's failure to state a per se illegal antitrust claim does not necessarily prove fatal to his 
case if he can state a claim under the rule of reason."" Carl Sandburg Vill. Condo. Ass'n No. 1, 758 F.2d 203, 210 (7th Cir. 1985) 
(citing Fortner Enter., Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 499-500, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969);Warner 
Mgmt. Consultants, Inc. v. Data Gen. Corp., 545 F. Supp. 956, 966 (N.D. Ill. 1982)); see also Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 
v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 35, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (""The time has therefore come to 
abandon the 'per se' label and refocus the inquiry on the adverse economic effects, and the potential economic benefits, that the 
tie may have.""). In a related area, the Supreme Court recently adopted Justice O'Connor's reasoning in Jefferson Parish Hosp. 
Dist. No. 2 and held that tying arrangements involving patents should be evaluated based upon their market power ""rather than 
under the per se rule."" Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 126 S.Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006). Although the per se 
analysis of the Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 majority has not been expressly over-ruled, in the intervening twenty-one 
years since Carl Sandburg Vill. Condo. Ass'n No. 1, the Supreme Court has not found occasion to disagree with this Circuit's 
approach. "
869,1, All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. 
872,2," Although Pier 39 also claims support from Storek & Storek, Inc. v. Citicorp Real Estate, Inc. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 44, that 
case is wholly consistent with our conclusion here. In Storek & Storek, the contract permitted a lender to withhold loan funding if 
it determined "" 'in the Lender's sole judgment' "" that the borrower lacked sufficient funds to complete a real estate development 
project. (Id. at p. 49.) Despite the express grant of seemingly absolute discretion to the lender, not found here, the court implied 
a requirement that the lender's judgment regarding the borrower's funding be subject to a test of reasonableness. (Id. at pp. 59-
60.)"
872,3," For example, Division 2 of Exhibit ""C"" states that the anticipated work would ""complete the premises to a finished condition 
ready for the conduct of business therein,"" including a new sign and certain finishing, electrical, and mechanical work. Division 6 
of the exhibit states that ""Tenant shall remodel the premises, both interior and exterior, including, but not limited to, the 
storefront, show windows, signage, electrical system, interior fixturing, displays, cash wrap and finishes."" "
874,4," While it is true, as Pier 39 argues, that Flags pleaded injury to competition in the amended cross-complaint, that was a 
consequence of injury inflicted on Flags as an ongoing business. Any harm, regardless of its nature, necessarily weakened 
Flags's relative position as a competitor. In any event, the Supreme Court expressly instructed in Cel-Tech that its standard is to 
be applied on the basis of the nature of the parties-that is, whether they are direct competitors-not the type of injury suffered. 
(Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 187 & fn. 12.) "
875,5," There is nothing per se unfair in Pier 39's giving favorable treatment to tenants in which it has an equity interest. If this alleged 
""unfairness"" were the gravamen of Flags's cause of action, the claim truly would be governed by Cel-Tech and such cases as 
People's Choice Wireless. As explained below, however, we do not read Flags's claim to rely only this fact as the basis for its 
claim."
875,6," It is noteworthy that although Flags includes vague allegations about disclosure of confidential business information and trade 
secrets, it includes no breach of contract claim on this ground, suggesting that any information entrusted to Pier 39 was not 
provided under contractual protection.o"
875,7," Contrary to the ruling of the trial court, this is not a situation in which Flags is attempting to enforce the City's contract. Flags 
has no right to recover the damages otherwise owing to the City or to compel specific performance of the master lease. Flags 
does, however, have the right to prevent Pier 39 from engaging in an unfair business practice if it can demonstrate that Pier 39 
has given benefits to tenants that combined with Pier 39 to deprive the City of payments owed under the master lease.F "
876,8," At oral argument, Flags argued for the first time that if we reverse on the claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing, we should also reverse and remand the trial court's decision on the indemnity claim because the outcome on the former "
877,," could affect the outcome on the latter. Because this argument was not raised in Flags's opening brief, it is waived. (Baugh v. 
Garl (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 737, 746)."
877,9," In vacating the judgment, we also vacate the attorney fees and costs award of some $ 941,863. Because Pier 39's recovery of 
$ 11,296 on its cross-complaint consisted entirely of attorney fees, we assume that the remaining costs and fees award of $ 
941,863 related solely to the claims made in Flags's cross-complaint, as to which the trial court's judgment has been reversed or 
vacated. Accordingly, we dismiss Flags's petition for writ of supersedeas as moot. "
878,1, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise noted. 
879,2," Apex filed nine separate notices of appeal, one from the judgment and the others from various postjudgment orders. We 
address only the appealed orders that Apex addresses in its opening brief."
879,3," Fry's asserts in its respondent's brief that statutory changes resulting from Proposition 64, passed in the November 2004 
election, apply to this action and bar Apex from obtaining any relief on its claims brought on behalf of the general public under 
section 17200. We need not address that issue because Apex's section 17200 claims on behalf of the general public fail for 
other reasons. Even if applied retroactively, Proposition 64 does not compel reversal of the portion of the judgment in favor of 
Apex on its claim that Fry's violated section 17504, as Apex brought that claim as a direct competitor allegedly injured by Fry's 
acts of unfair competition (in the form of false advertising) as well as on behalf of the general public. The question of whether Proposition 64 applies retroactively is now pending before the California Supreme Court. (E.g., Bivens 
v. Corel Corp. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1392, review granted April 27, 2005, S132695; Lytwyn v. Fry's Electronics, Inc. (2005) 
126 Cal.App.4th 1455, review granted April 27, 2005, S133075.)"
879,4, A fifth cause of action for negligent interference with prospective economic advantage was dismissed before trial.
879,5," References to ""Fry's"" in connection to the first, second and third causes of action include Randy Fry. The fourth cause of action 
was brought against the corporate defendant only."
879,6," Black's Law Dictionary defines ""bait and switch"" as ""[a] sales practice whereby a merchant advertises a low-priced product to 
lure customers into the store, only to induce them to buy a higher-priced product."" (Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004), p. 152, 
col. 2.) Apex does not use the term ""bait and switch"" in the second cause of action but alleges conduct falling within the 
definition of that term. "
881,7," Presumably, Apex intended to refer to legislation contained in the Business and Professions Code authorizing its claims 
regarding Fry's alleged unfair and deceptive acts and practices. "
882,8," Whether Fry's has violated the permanent injunction included in the judgment is not at issue in Apex's appeal or Fry's cross-
appeal challenging the propriety of the court's issuance of the permanent injunction. Whether the court abused its discretion in 
issuing the injunction is a question of law we address in Fry's cross-appeal."
882,9," We decline the invitation in Apex's reply to Fry's opposition to the request for judicial notice to treat the request as a motion to 
take additional evidence under Code of Civil Procedure section 909. "
883,10," All further rule references are to the California Rules of Court. Under rule 18(b)(2), unless the reviewing court orders 
otherwise, within 20 days after the first notice of designation of exhibits is filed under rule 18(a),""[a]ny party in possession of 
designated exhibits returned by the superior court must put them into numerical or alphabetical order and send them to the 
reviewing court with two copies of a list of the exhibits sent. If the reviewing court clerk finds the list correct, the clerk must sign 
and return one copy to the party.""u"
883,11, The court did not expressly rule on Fry's motion for mistrial. 
884,12," The court suggested that Fry's could ""remedy"" this concern by arguing that the Apex's customer-complaint evidence showed 
no more than bad customer relations on the part of Fry's and did not prove Fry's intent or purpose to injure competition. The 
court also suggested that Fry's could successfully object on the ground of relevance to customer-complaint testimony that did 
not evidence such purpose or intent."
884,13," Apex's second amended complaint states that Apex ""is . . . the assignee of the rights and claims held by Abacus America, 
Inc., a California corporation."" The second amended complaint explains that references to ""Plaintiff"" in the pleading are to Apex 
and ""its assignor"" collectively."
884,14," The court instructed the jury on the elements of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage with a modified 
version of BAJI No. 7.82 as follows: ""The plaintiff Apex and its assignor Abacus also seek to recover damages based upon a "
885,," claim of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. [P] The essential elements of such a claim are: [P] 1. An 
economic relationship existed between the plaintiff and their [sic] customers containing a probable future economic benefit or 
advantage to plaintiff; [P] 2. The defendant knew of the existence of the relationship; [P] 3. The defendant intentionally engaged 
in wrongful acts or conduct designed to interfere with or disrupt this relationship; [P] 4. The economic relationship was actually 
interfered with or disrupted; and [P] 5. The wrongful conduct of the defendant which was designed to interfere with or disrupt this 
relationship caused damage to the plaintiff."""
885,15," All subsequent references to question Nos. are to questions on the ""Special Verdict Re Interference"" form. "
886,16," During its deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking: ""Re: Special Verdict Interference, question # 4, does 'intentional 
acts' mean 'intentional wrongful act.'?"" This note suggests the jury was confused regarding the element of independent 
wrongfulness. The court's directed the jury to consider its question ""in light of the other questions posed in the Special Verdict re: 
Interference and, more particularly, question # 5 which references 'wrongful.' "" "
888,17," Because we reverse the judgment as to the fourth cause of action based on the instructional error discussed above, we need 
not consider Apex's contentions that the court committed cumulatively prejudicial error by refusing Apex's ""clarifying"" instruction 
No. 125, refusing its requested BAJI No. 2.04 regarding Fry's failure to deny or explain instances of wrongful conduct, giving 
Fry's instruction No. 71 directing the jury to disregard Belch's ""statement[s] or interpretation of the law,"" and refusing to give 
Apex's requested instructions regarding ""bait and switch"" and ""used goods."" "
889,18," Section 17044 provides: ""It is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this State to sell or use any article or product 
as a 'loss leader' as defined in Section 17030 of this chapter."" Cel-Tech held that section 17044 requires the same mental state 
as section 17043 - i.e., acting with the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition. (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 
pp. 175-178.) "
893,19," Casa Blanca stated ""In [McAdams] it was said: '"" The established practice presupposes that counsel desiring such special 
findings will draft and propose them in the usual form [citation]. The action of the court in approving or disapproving them will 
constitute the ruling. Appellants here sought to conduct a general inquisition and neither drafted nor submitted any proposals for 
such consideration.""' [Citation.] [P] [McAdams] went on to say submission of a request without resolution is improper because: 
'That practice unfairly burdens the trial judge in that he must not only speculate which questions embrace ultimate as 
distinguished from evidentiary facts, but also search his recollection of the record without the assistance of a suggestion from 
counsel. Particularly if there is evidence which would tend to give a multiple choice in answering the interrogatory, the court 
should have guidance from the requesting party.' [Citation.]"" (Casa Blanca, supra, 159 Cal.App.3d at pp. 525-526.) "
895,20," The court twice made the point in its statement of decision that ""one or two, or even a few inadvertent instances of alleged 
misconduct, depending upon the specific type of business act or practice shown, are [insufficient] to prove a violation of either 
[section] 17200 or 17500 sufficient to warrant injunctive relief."" (Italics added.)"
895,21," The court's rejection of Apex's claim that Fry's sold used goods as new is also supported by substantial evidence in the form of 
testimony by Fry's cofounder Kathryn Kolder and employee Scott Anderson that when Fry's places a returned item on the shelf 
for resale, its practice is to place a sticker on the item that identifies it as having been returned or unpackaged."
895,22," The court did not expressly rule that Fry's presented sufficient evidence to rebut the section 17071 and 17071.5 presumptions; 
that ruling is necessarily implied by the court's rejection of Apex's contention that ""[Fry's] evidence that loss leader sales were 
undertaken to expand [Fry's] customer base . . . is insufficient to rebut the statutory presumptions because [Fry's] proffered 
explanations do not fall within a statutory exception [or] constitute a business necessity."" "
896,23," Section 17050 provides: ""The prohibitions of this chapter against locality discriminations, sales below cost, and loss leaders do 
not apply to any sale made: [P] (a) In closing out in good faith the owner's stock or any part thereof for the purpose of 
discontinuing his trade in any such article or product and in the case of the sale of seasonal goods or to the bona fide sale of 
perishable goods to prevent loss to the vendor by spoilage or depreciation; provided, notice is given to the public thereof. [P] (b) 
When the goods are damaged or deteriorated in quality, and notice is given to the public thereof. [P] (c) By an officer acting 
under the orders of any court. [P] (d) In an endeavor made in good faith to meet the legal prices of a competitor selling the same 
article or product, in the same locality or trade area and in the ordinary channels of trade. [P] (e) In an endeavor made in good 
faith by a manufacturer, selling an article or product of his own manufacture, in a transaction and sale to a wholesaler or retailer 
for resale to meet the legal prices of a competitor selling the same or a similar or comparable article or product, in the same 
locality or trade area and in the ordinary channels of trade. [P] The notice required to be given under this section shall not be 
sufficient unless the subject of such sales is kept separate from other stocks and clearly and legibly marked with the reason for 
such sales, and any advertisement of such goods must indicate the same facts and the number of items to be sold."" "
898,24," CCP section 2033 was repealed July 1, 2005 (Stats. 2004, Ch. 182, § 22), as part of a nonsubstantive reorganization of the 
Civil Discovery Act of 1986. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016 et seq.) Subdivision (o) of CCP section 2033 was replaced, without 
substantive change, by Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420. "
899,25," RFA Nos. 17 and 18 both asked Fry's to admit: ""More than once since April 1997 Fry's Electronics' San Diego store has sold 
as a loss leader an item of merchandise advertised by Fry's for sale in the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper."" However, the 
two RFA's used different definitions of the term ""loss leader."" RFA No. 17 stated: ""The term 'loss leader' is being used in this 
request in the sense of California Business & Professions Code [section] 17030[, subdivision] (a), which provides: 'Loss leader' 
means any article or product sold at less than cost[w]here the purpose is to induce, promote or encourage the purchase of other 
merchandise."" RFA No. 18 stated: ""The term 'loss leader' is being used in this request in the sense of California Business & 
Professions Code [section] 17030[, subdivision] (c), which provides: 'Loss leader' means any article or product sold at less than 
cost where the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors."" RFA Nos. 19 and 20 both asked Fry's to admit: ""More than once since April 1997 Fry's Electronics' San Diego store has sold as 
a loss leader an item of merchandise advertised by Fry's for sale in the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper wherein the 
quantity to be purchased by any one customer was advertised as limited to one item."" RFA No. 19 set forth the definition of ""loss 
leader"" of section 17030, subdivision (a) whereas RFA No. 20 set forth the definition of ""loss leader"" of section 17030, 
subdivision (c). Apex's motion for cost of proof sanctions indicated that it also sought sanctions for the cost of proving its RFA No. 14 
(concerning advertising items for sale that Fry's did not have on hand) and the court's ruling denying the motion addresses that 
RFA. However, we do not address RFA No. 14 because none of the declarations in support of Apex's motion (evidencing costs 
and attorney fees incurred in proving the truth of the RFA assertions) addressed RFA No. 14 and Apex does not address it on 
appeal."
899,26," Apex states in its opening brief: ""[T]he issue presented here is not APEX's entitlement to . . . [CCP] § 2033[, subdivision] (o) 
costs of proof. The questions are, who bears the burden of proof in making and defending such a motion, and what are those 
burdens?"" "
900,27," The interrogatory reference is to Judicial Council form interrogatory No. 17.1 which accompanies RFA's and asks the 
responding party to state, among other things, all facts upon which the party bases the response if the response is other than an 
unqualified admission."
900,28," As to each of Apex's RFA Nos. 17 through 20, Fry's stated the following in its response to interrogatory No. 17.1: ""To the 
extent that Fry's has ever sold below some measure of cost, such sale was done in good faith and for legitimate and lawful 
business purposes. For example and not by way of limitation: 1) Fry's competes with numerous others, and Fry's will lower its 
prices to match a competitor's price. 2) Fry's reduces prices at times below some measure of its cost, in order to stimulate 
interest in its stores and attract new and additional customers for the many and diverse products sold by Fry's. 3) Fry's does not 
sell goods below an appropriate measure of its costs. 4) Fry's sometimes reduces the price of merchandise that does not sell 
within Fry's initial time projections in order to reduce inventory. 5) Fry's always advertises merchandise at competitive prices with 
the intention of selling those items."""
900,29," For example, the court stated at oral argument: ""I'm not convinced the plaintiff has shown that the four factors under [CCP 
section] 2033[, subdivision] (o) applies [sic] here. And in that regard, I'm not convinced that Fry's acted unreasonably."" "
901,30," Section 17504 provides, in relevant part: ""(a) Any person, partnership, corporation, firm, joint stock company, association, or 
organization engaged in business in this state as a retail seller who sells any consumer good or service which is sold only in 
multiple units and which is advertised by price shall advertise those goods or services at the price of the minimum multiple unit in 
which they are offered. [P] (b) Nothing contained in subdivision (a) shall prohibit a retail seller from advertising any consumer 
good or service for sale at a single unit price where the goods or services are sold only in multiple units and not in single units as 
long as the advertisement also discloses, at least as prominently, the price of the minimum multiple unit in which they are 
offered."" "
902,31," In any event, whether Fry's failure to display a minimum unit price at least as prominently as the item's multiple unit price is 
deemed a violation of section 17504, subdivision (b) or simply false or misleading advertising under section 17500, the conduct 
is unlawful and subject to being enjoined under section 17203. "
903,32," Kolder described ""bursts"" as ""those starry things"" that contain ""little additional blurbs"" to draw the reader's attention to the 
contents of the burst."
903,33," Kolder admitted to being aware of the court's summary adjudication ruling on the issue of section 17504. She testified that 
Fry's changed its advertising to make the ""individual price type font . . . the same size as the multiunit type font."" Kolder was 
shown an offending advertisement and admitted it was published after the change in advertising that she testified to 
implementing. She admitted Fry's used bursts and had no policy as to whether the single unit price of a multiple-unit item would 
be placed inside a burst, and she identified several advertisements by Fry's in which bursts were used in that way. "

concludes it would not have been. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding both financing and permitting. ""Plaintiff's antitrust claims also fail because they do not satisfy HN11[

245-999. Although IMCA asserts that these copyright certifications are ""incorporated by reference"" into its Complaint ""as if set 
forth [therein] in full,"" see Complaint, P 19, IMCA has not attached a single copyright certification or any copy of its ""Official 
Rules"" to its Complaint. "
926,2," IMCA points out that the defendants never incorporate their various factual allegations into the Counts of their Counterclaims. 
The defendants respond that the purpose of the factual allegations and the relationship of those factual allegations to their 
Counterclaims are obvious. "
927,3," The defendants explain that IMCA recently severed a long-standing contractual relationship with RTA and that they now have a 
contractual relationship with RTA. "
932,4," Circuit Courts of Appeals that have expressly recognized the defense are the Ninth, see Practice Mgmt. Information. Corp. v. 
American Med. Ass'n, 121 F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1997)(adopting the doctrine of copyright misuse as a ""defense to copyright 
infringement""); and compare Altera Corp. v. Clear Logic, Inc., 424 F.3d 1079, 1090 (9th Cir. 2005)(although the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals had recognized copyright misuse as a defense to a copyright infringement claim, the court declined to 
recognize it as an independent claim in the absence of allegations of copyright infringement), the Fifth, see Alcatel USA, Inc. v. 
DGI Techs., Inc., 166 F.3d 772, 792 (5th Cir. 1999)(""We recognized the copyright misuse defense in [DSC Communs. Corp. v. 
DGI Techs., Inc., 81 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir. 1996)].""), the Fourth, see Lasercomb America, Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 976 
(4th Cir. 1990)(""We are of the view . . . that since copyright and patent law serve parallel public interests, a 'misuse' defense 
should apply to infringement actions brought to vindicate either right.""), the Third, see Video Pipeline, Inc., 342 F.3d at 206 
(expressly ""extend[ing] the patent misuse doctrine to copyright, and recognizing that it might operate beyond its traditional anti-
competitive context,"" but ultimately holding that it was ""inapplicable"" in the case before the court, because the plaintiff's licensing 
agreements did not interfere significantly with copyright policy), the Second, see Rosemont Enters., Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 
366 F.2d 303, 311 (2d Cir. 1966)(Lumbard, C.J., concurring, but writing for a majority of the judges)(recognizing an ""unclean 
hands"" doctrine where the copyright holder sought to use his copyright ""to restrict the dissemination of information""), and the 
Federal, see DSC Communications Corp. v. Pulse Communications, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999)(""Copyright 
misuse is a defense to a claim of copyright infringement.""). "
933,5," Also, in Hill v. Xyquad, Inc., 939 F.2d 627, 632 (8th Cir. 1991), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that a defendant's 
assertion of the equitable defense of misuse of copyright ""may not be without merit,"" but left the matter under the ""watchful eye 
of the district court."" As IMCA asserts, this statement hardly constitutes express recognition of the defense, but just as clearly, 
neither does it constitute foreclosure of such a defense, such that striking the defense would be appropriate. Dico, Inc., 266 F.3d 
at 879-80 (the district court properly struck a due process affirmative defense on the ground that it was foreclosed by a prior 
decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and a subsequent decision of the United States Supreme Court had not 
undermined the appellate court's decision, as the defendant argued). "
934,6," Neither of the parties cites the Saxon case, even though it is controlling authority in this Circuit."
934,7," The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has discussed copyright misuse as an ""unclean hands defense"" which ""forbids the use of the 
[copyright] to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the [Copyright] Office and which is contrary to public 
policy to grant."" Alcatel USA, Inc. v. DGI Techs., Inc., 166 F.3d 772, 792 (5th Cir. 1999)(alterations in original, internal citations 
omitted); accord Rosemont Enters., Inc., 366 F.2d at 303 (Lumbard, C.J., concurring, but writing for a majority of the 
judges)(also recognizing an ""unclean hands"" doctrine that should have barred a preliminary injunction against the alleged 
copyright infringer where the copyright holder sought to use his copyright ""to restrict the dissemination of information""). As 
explained more fully infra, however, it appears that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals distinguishes between an ""unclean 
hands"" defense and a ""misuse of copyright"" defense, having expressly recognized and upheld an ""unclean hands"" defense 
based on inequitable conduct by the copyright holder toward the infringer, see Saxon, 968 F.2d at 680, but having thus far only 
assumed that a ""misuse"" defense exists, if based on adequately pleaded allegations of restraint of competition, or tying 
arrangements, or presumably other antitrust violations. See United Tel. Co., 855 F.2d at 612. "
935,8," IMCA has mischaracterized the defendants' affirmative defenses, which are based only in part on allegations of anti-
competitive conduct and antitrust violations. See Answer, Third Affirmative Defense, PP 17-12 (alleging anti-competitive conduct 
and price-fixing); Fourth Affirmative Defense, PP 1-4 (alleging ""misuse"" or ""unclean hands"" by IMCA in attempting to use 
copyrights contrary to public policy to fix prices and restrain competition). For example, the defendants' third affirmative defense 
is also based on allegations that IMCA has ""misused"" its copyright by bringing this infringement action not for any proper 
purpose of protecting its copyrights, but to harass, oppress, and damage the defendants, and to coerce the defendants into 
selling their businesses to IMCA, and has thereby attempted to expand its copyrights far beyond the limited monopoly granted to 
a copyright holder. Id., Third Affirmative Defense, PP 5-6. Thus, even if a ""misuse"" defense could not be based on allegations of 
anti-competitive conduct or antitrust violations, the ""misuse"" defense alleged here could survive on the basis of other kinds of 
allegations of inequitable or wrongful conduct. "
940,9," Presumably, where the question of whether or not IMCA has asserted ""sham"" claims of copyright infringement also arises in 
the context of IMCA's motion to dismiss the defendants' Counterclaims, the court must likewise take IMCA's allegations as true. "
942,10," As an aside, the court notes that it is clear that the defendants intended the thirty-three paragraphs of factual allegations in 
their Counterclaims, with subheadings for ""jurisdiction and venue,"" ""parties,"" and ""general fact allegations,"" to provide the factual 
basis for their counterclaims. See Defendants' Answer, Counterclaim of Todd Staley, PP 1-33 & Counterclaim of USMTS, Inc., 
PP 1-33. The fact that another internal subheading, ""COUNT 1 (ABUSE OF PROCESS),"" was interpolated before the 
allegations of the specific counterclaim and relief sought did not obscure or confuse the purpose of the preceding factual 
allegations as allegations intended to support the claim. "

of Latin American Music Co., Inc., and is also president of ACEMLA de Puerto Rico, Inc., an acronym for Asociación de 
Compositores y Escritores de Música Latinoamericana, a performance rights organization."
948,3," The motion also opposes the joinder of ACEMLA, which subject is not addressed here becau se it has been ren dered m oot."
948,4," Also referred to as Disco Hit Trujillo Alto Plaza, Inc. (Docket No. 1, at 2, ¶ 4 .)"
948,5," See 17 U.S.C.A. § 101 et seq., as amended. "
949,6," On April 24, 2003, the court issued an order to continue the injunction hearing at a time to be agreed on by the parties. (Docket 
No. 37.) The parties not having agreed to a setting, the record reflects nothing further in relation to the setting. "
950,7, 15 U.S.C. § 15. 
952,8," The facts from plaintiff's statement of uncontroverted material facts are unopposed and will be taken as true. (See Local Rule 
56.) Additionally, in plaintiff's statement of uncontested facts they mistakenly number paragraphs 16, 17, 18 and 19 twice, each 
time reflecting different facts. I n um ber herein the paragraph s reflecting the change. "
955,9," See Docket No. 78-2, Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontested Material Facts, at 2-3, ¶ 6 (noting LAM CO's registration and 
recordation of disputed work s)."
955,10," See Decosta v. Viacom Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 602, 606 (1st Cir. 1992). "
956,11," In addition to the tying argument, defendants also argue plaintiff's refusal to deal, license, and negotiate causes anti-
competitive market effects under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. However, that issue is better addressed under Section 2 of the 
Act dealing with monopolization, which I address infra. "
958,12," The controversy was before the District Court of Massachusetts on similar procedural grounds. In both Data Gen. Corp. and 
the instant case the defendants assert counterclaims for violations of antitrust under the Sherman Act and corrupt business 
practices under RICO."
958,13," Defendants, in their verified amended counterclaim vaguely assert through a brief conclusory allegation that plaintiff has 
established a monopoly in the relevant market. (Docket No. 72-1, at 30, ¶ 49.) Plaintiff on the other hand does not directly 
dispute this in the motion for summary judgment. "
960,14," Counterplaintiffs have also alleged extortionate collections of credit as predicate acts, but since these do not involve fraud, 
Rule 9(b) requirements do not apply. "
961,15," See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement regarding the necessity to identify circumstances constituting fraud 
with particularity. See also Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d at 42 (noting that the First Circuit extends the 
particularity requirement to predicate acts of fraud under RICO). "
968,1," Though not all of Start's coverage of Solaia Technology's infringement claims is allegedly defamatory, we quote extensively 
from the three issues of Start mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint in order to provide context for the statements at issue. "
971,2," It is unclear whether the headline ""SOLAIA MESS"" was provided by the unnamed author or by Start. "
978,3," As the defendants note, the term ""actual malice"" means ""constitutional malice,"" as described in New York Times Co. v. 
Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964). Actual or constitutional malice-subjective awareness of the falsity 
or probable falsity of a statement-is distinguishable from common law malice-ill will or intent to harm. See Hustler Magazine v. 
Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 53, 99 L. Ed. 2d 41, 50, 108 S. Ct. 876, 880-81 (1988). "
980,4," The appellate court stated that the ""sting"" issue was forfeited because the plaintiffs did not raise it until their reply brief. 357 Ill. 
App. 3d at 15, citing Todt v. Ameritech Corp., 327 Ill. App. 3d 359, 369, 763 N.E.2d 389, 261 Ill. Dec. 419 (2002). In their 
response brief below, the defendants argued that the sting of the ""Conspiracy of a Shakedown"" article came from Rockwell 
Automation's antitrust complaint. The plaintiffs were entitled to counter. See 188 Ill. 2d R. 341(g); Lieb v. Judges' Retirement 
System of Illinois, 314 Ill. App. 3d 87, 96, 731 N.E.2d 809, 247 Ill. Dec. 36 (2000) (""Portions of a reply brief will not be stricken if 
the arguments respond to arguments made in the appellee brief""). "
981,5," We note that in paragraph 38 of Rockwell Automation's antitrust complaint, Rockwell Automation stated, ""Solaia and Niro 
identified Rockwell products as the basis for their infringement claims."" The defendants have not brought this passage to our 
attention, but it does not change our conclusion. This passage does not mean that Rockwell Automation sued Niro personally, 
and it is likely that Niro, as a named partner of the firm representing Solaia Technology, advised his client about which 
companies may have infringed on the '318 patent. "
982,6," In April 2002 Start created a narrative of innocent corporate victims deserving sympathy against deeply greedy people who ""aid 
and abet"" maniacal markets, namely, Schneider Automation and Solaia Technology, as well as ""Solaia's legal machine,"" Niro 
and NSHN. ""Aid and abet"" means ""assist or facilitate the commission of a crime, or *** promote its accomplishment."" See Black's 
Law Dictionary 76 (8th ed. 2004); see also 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2002) (""A person is legally accountable for the conduct of 
another when *** he *** aids, abets, agrees or attempts to aid, such other person in the planning or commission of the [criminal] 
offense""). In August 2002 Start labeled Solaia Technology's infringement claims as ""legal carnage,"" noting that ""many observers are 
frustrated that the patent system is being used as a vicious legal weapon to generate revenue."" Start then noted that, while 
Solaia Technology's attorneys in NSHN denied any connection between Solaia Technology and Schneider Automation, 
documents reveal ""the relationship between these companies might be more intimately linked."" Smedley hinted that ""key details"" 
in the Rockwell Automation antitrust case ""continue to be revealed. Speculation and concern about certain misdeeds are on the 
rise."" ""Misdeed"" means ""a wrong deed: an immoral or criminal action."" See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1443 
(1986). Finally, in January 2003 Start published the industry veteran's letter, which observed, ""there are people in the world,"" like Johnny 
Cochrane, the Washington, D.C., sniper, and Enron and WorldCom executives, ""who want to make a lot of money and they don't 
care how they do it."" Start later mentioned that ""rumors have been flying around about the relationship that exists between 
Solaia and Schneider."" "
993,1," This case was originally to be decided by one judge, pursuant to WIS. STAT. § 752.31(2)(b) (2003-04). On April 28, 2006, the 
chief judge issued an order, sua sponte, declaring that this case would be considered by a three-judge panel. "
994,2," On January 9, 2006, this court granted Williams and Hegney's motion to consolidate their cases, Nos. 2005AP2686 and 
2005AP2687, for appeal."
994,3, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2003-04 version unless otherwise noted. 
996,4," HN3[
] WISCONSIN STAT. § 114.14(1) provides: Equipment, control of airport; expense; regulations. (1) The governing body of a city, village, town or county which has established an airport or landing field, or landing and 
take-off strip, and acquired, leased or set apart real property for such purpose may construct, improve, equip, maintain and 
operate the same, or may vest jurisdiction for the construction, improvement, equipment, maintenance and operation 
thereof in any suitable officer, board or body of such city, village, town or county. The expenses of such construction, 
improvement, equipment, maintenance and operation shall be a city, village, town or county charge as the case may be. 
The governing body of a city, village, town or county may adopt regulations, and establish fees or charges for the use of 
such airport or landing field, or may authorize an officer, board or body of such village, city, town or county having 
jurisdiction to adopt such regulations and establish such fees or charges, subject however to the approval of such 
governing body before they shall take effect. (Emphasis added.) "
1000,5," In addition, charges of conspiracy were also brought against the city, whereas here, the airport permits are held by seventeen 
different cab companies, belying any concerns about conspiracies or monopolies."
1000,6, We also conclude that the foreign case law cited by Williams and Hegney does not override Wisconsin precedent. 
1009,1," In Illinois Tool, the Supreme Court determined that a tying arrangement should be evaluated under the standard applied in 
Jefferson Parish, which required proof of sufficient market power to restrain competition in the tied market. However, in dictum, 
Jefferson Parish also repeated the market power presumption established in prior cases when it stated, ""if the government has 
granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere 
gives the seller market power."" See Illinois Tool, at 1284 (quoting Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 16). The Supreme Court rejected 
this dictum in Jefferson Parish along with the cases that established the market power presumption. See id. at 1284-85, 1287-
88, 1290-91. "
1019,1," CODH subsequently became Central Oregon Community Hospital (""COCH""), which on January 1, 2001 consolidated with St. 
Charles Medical Center, a hospital in Bend, Oregon. The assets and liabilities were combined into an umbrella corporation, 
Cascade Health Services (""CHS""), and CODH was renamed. Recently, Cascade Health Services has been renamed Cascade 
Healthcare Community, and COCH is now referred to as the Redmond campus of St. Charles. In referring to the Redmond 
hospital, the court will use the terms ""CODH,"" ""COCH,"" ""Redmond hospital,"" and ""Redmond campus"" interchangeably. "
1020,2," Although it is clear that BAG provided the lion's share of anesthesiology services to St. Charles, plaintiff, as an M.D. 
anesthesiologist with active privileges at the Redmond hospital, also had visiting privileges at St. Charles, and apparently 
provided services there at least occasionally."
1020,3," Plaintiff had previously discussed with COCH administration whether an all-MD anesthesia staff would be in the best interests 
of the hospital. He had begun setting the groundwork for the formation of an MD anesthesia group at COCH."
1020,4," The NPDB is a flagging system intended to facilitate a comprehensive review of health care practitioners' professional 
credentials. Adverse actions taken with respect to staff privileges are reported by NPDB to state licensing boards and health 
care entities. "
1022,5," For purposes of this motion, the Oregon antitrust statutes, ORS 646.725 and ORS 646.730, overlap the Sherman Act entirely, 
and the disposition of the state claims will be identical to that of the federal claims. See Oregon Laborers-Employers Health and 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 185 F.3d 957, 963 at n.4 (9th Cir. 1999)."
1022,6," Ordinarily, whether alleged concerted action is such an unlawful restraint is analyzed under the ""rule of reason."" Continental 
T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1997). However, in some cases, the alleged 
restraint, if proven, is so manifestly anti-competitive in nature and lacking in any redeeming value that they are declared illegal 
per se, with no need to apply the rule of reason balancing factors. Id. at 50. Here, the court cannot say that the alleged conduct 
of the parties would, if proven, be so anti-competitive as to warrant a finding of per se illegality. See, e.g., Oltz v. St. Peters "
1023,," Community Hospital, 861 F.2d 1440 (9th Cir. 1988) (appropriate analysis was rule of reason). As such, the rule of reason 
analysis applies here. "
1024,7," Thus, it does not appear that plaintiff is alleging a conspiracy amongst the CHS defendants. In any event, such an allegation 
would fail, because the CHS defendants -- CHS, Diegel, and Drs. Cross, Price and Murphy -- do not have any independent 
interests vis a vis Dr. Ford's continued practice at the Redmond hospital. None of the medical staff were in competition with Dr. 
Ford for provision of anesthesiology services. Compare Oltz v. St. Peter's Community Hosp., 861 F.2d 1440, 1450 (9th Cir. 
1988) (finding of conspiracy permissible upon evidence of direct competition on the part of the hospital staff who allegedly 
conspired with the hospital); see also Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 
U.S. 1074, 112 S. Ct. 973, 117 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1992); Patel v. Scotland Memorial Hosp., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5258, 1995 
WL319213 (M.D.N.C. 1995) at *4 (no conspiracy possible between hospital staff and hospital absent personal financial motive 
on the part of the staff). On the record before it, the court finds that there is not a genuine issue of material fact on whether the 
medical staff and the hospital could enter into a conspiracy against plaintiff, and would grant summary judgment in favor of the 
CHS defendants if plaintiff intended to alleged such a conspiracy. "
1026,8," It appears from the record that St. Charles Medical Center, in Bend, does not rely to the same extent on CNRAs as do the rural 
hospitals, and that there may be less -- or no -- competition from them for the BAG anesthesiologists who practice there. 
However, to the limited extent that plaintiff defined the relevant market at all, it was defined as ""Central Oregon,"" not Bend, and 
the court notes that there are multiple other hospitals in the Central Oregon marketplace that use CNRAs, including the 
Redmond, Prineville and Madras hospitals."
1026,9," The court also notes that even if Bend alone was the relevant market, and even if St. Charles does not use CRNAs, it would 
still be far from certain that BAG has an illegal monopoly there. Plaintiff himself enjoyed visiting privileges at St. Charles during 
the time that BAG is alleged to have had an exclusive arrangement with the hospital, and did occasionally practice there, and at 
oral argument BAG commented that no non-BAG M.D. anesthesiologist that has applied has ever been denied privileges there. "
1028,10," Although the CHS defendants argue that the Caucasian doctors are not fair comparisons because they were not identically 
situated with plaintiff, the court finds that their situations -- which involve such things as verbal threats to other staff and alleged 
drinking on the job -- are close enough to the harassment and inappropriate behavior allegations brought against plaintiff to use 
them for comparison, especially when one considers the hospital's rationale in refusing plaintiff privileges was largely patient and 
staff safety."
1028,11," To the extent that the CHS defendants argue that claims against the Caucasian doctors were investigated and found to lack 
merit or to be insufficient to warrant termination of privileges, the court notes that a jury could conclude from the record that prior 
to informing plaintiff that his application for renewal of privileges would be denied the hospital did not provide him the benefit of 
such an investigation. Further, the one body that clearly took significant evidence regarding the complaints against plaintiff -- the 
Hearing Panel -- was the one body that recommended reinstating plaintiff with certain conditions. Its recommendation was then 
rejected by the ad hoc committee."
1028,12," Dr. Price allegedly told Dr. Choo's colleagues that if Dr. Choo continued to be with their practice, Dr. Price and his medical 
group would cease referring patients to their practice. "
1029,13," CHS' argument in the alternative that plaintiff breached the contract first and therefore CHS cannot be in breach is not well 
taken. Plaintiff alleges that CHS did not provide him the process required by the bylaws as a result of the accusations leveled 
against him; the hospital cannot relieve itself of that obligation by conclusory statements that because those charges were made 
the plaintiff breached the agreement and the process was therefore not required. Regardless, the better course for purposes of 
evaluating what actually occurred -- both in terms of plaintiff's conduct and CHS' response -- it to allow a jury to hear the 
evidence and make its own determination. "
1030,14, See ORS 441.055(3)(c).
1030,15," CHS' argument that plaintiff was at fault at a greater percentage than the hospital, and that he therefore cannot maintain a 
negligence claim against it, is better considered by a jury who can consider all the evidence surrounding the hospital's policy 
regarding applications for privileges and what plaintiff and CHS did, and did not do, in processing plaintiff's application. "
1042,1," GO has filed a parallel action in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco alleging violations of California 
state law. They assert that the federal action is only a ""protective suit"", and have asked me to stay all proceedings pending 
completion of the California action. GO has offered no good reason for this request, and it is denied."
1042,2," As also set forth in Section IV of this Opinion, I am striking all allegations in the Amended Complaint underlying the claims 
asserted by GO in the Amended Complaint concerning Lucent's own alleged antitrust injuries in light of the fact that no such 
claims had been assigned by Lucent to GO when the Amended Complaint was filed. "
1043,3," Although further development of the PenPoint technology was abandoned in 1994, GO alleges that licensing efforts for the pen 
technology continued and that products based on it were successfully marketed through 2002. Id. P 29. In addition, GO points 
out that there are still currently existing corporate users of PenPoint and pen technology, and various OEMs continue to provide 
support for those products. Id."
1043,4," As an initial matter, a claim made by GO that the statutory period should not start until it acquired from Lucent the claims it is 
asserting is erroneous. If (contrary to what I am holding) the fraudulent concealment doctrine did apply, limitations would start to 
run when Kaplan learned of the factual basis for GO's claims, not when GO actually acquired those claims. Weinberger, 498 "
1044,," F.2d at 555. GO's submissions clearly assert that Kaplan first became aware of the facts underlying GO's antitrust claims during 
his 2002 deposition. Opp'n at 13. "
1047,5," Indeed, many plaintiffs brought private actions in the immediate wake of the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by 
Judge Jackson in United States v. Microsoft, 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000). This MDL proceeding was created in 2000 as a 
result of these lawsuits. Although, at first, most of the cases were instituted by consumers, numerous Microsoft competitors 
brought suit after the D.C. Circuit had reviewed Judge Jackson's findings, see United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. 
D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and well before the one-year period following the entry of the consent decree had 
expired. "
1049,6," As indicated above, at the conclusion of the hearing on Microsoft's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, I asked the 
parties to submit supplemental briefing on the question of whether GO and its counsel should be required to pay the fees of 
Microsoft's counsel and to make a compensatory payment to the court for costs incurred in preparing for the hearing without 
knowledge of the third assignment. I did not, however, advise GO that I was considering imposing the sanction of striking 
allegations in the amended complaint underlying the claims GO was asserting on behalf of Lucent. Accordingly, in accordance 
with the directive of Rule 11(c) that a court should provide a party with notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond before 
imposing a sanction, GO may move for a reconsideration of this order on or before July 21, 2006, if it wishes to challenge my 
order striking the Lucent allegations."
1049,7," I recognize that rather than dismissing the action, I could grant leave to GO to file a second amended complaint containing 
allegations based upon the third assignment as received from Lucent. At first blush this approach might seem to be mandated by 
the well-established general rule that an assignment of claims may be made at any time before trial. See, e.g., Dubuque Stone 
Prod. Co. v. Fred L. Gray Co., 356 F.2d 718, 724 (8th Cir. 1966); Kilbourn v. Western Sur. Co., 187 F.2d 567, 571 (10th Cir. 
1951); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a) (prescribing leniency in the real party in interest rule); 6A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller 
& Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1545 (2d ed. 1990) (explaining the application of the real party in interest rule 
to assignments). Following that approach here, however, would have the effect of rewarding GO for having filed its first amended 
complaint in violation of Rule 11. Presumably, what claims GO might assert in the second amended complaint would be deemed 
to relate back to the original complaint. With relation back, by means of the continuing violation theory, GO would be able to 
circumvent the statutory period by asserting claims for injuries suffered by Lucent during the four years dating back from the 
original complaint rather than from the second amended complaint. Thus, far more on point than the cases just cited following 
the general rule, is United States ex rel. Wulff v. CMA, Inc., 890 F.2d 1070, 1074-75 (9th Cir. 1989), where the court refused to 
allow an amendment based upon a belated assignment because the effect of the amendment would have been to resuscitate a 
claim barred by the limitations provision of the Miller Act. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a) advisory committee's note (noting that 
Rule 17(a)'s leniency ""should not be misunderstood or distorted"", and is ""intended to prevent forfeiture when determination of the 
proper party to sue is difficult or when an understandable mistake has been made.""). "
1058,1," The Second Amended Complaint pleads that Karyn Delaney and Blue Sea Enterprises, Inc., are also GNC franchisees. The 
record, however, does not contain specific facts supporting this assertion. For the purpose of the motion to dismiss, the court 
shall draw all inferences in support of plaintiffs, the non-moving party, and assume that Karyn Delaney and Blue Sea 
Enterprises, Inc., are GNC franchisees. "
1062,2," In addition, HN10[
] the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recognized a third standard that falls 
somewhere between rule of reason analysis and a per se rule. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 461. The court of appeals refers to this middle 
ground as an abbreviated or ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis. Id. (citing Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 
1367 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1996); United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d Cir. 1993)). This ""quick look"" analysis ""applies 
'where per se condemnation is inappropriate, but where a full-blown industry analysis is not required to demonstrate the 
anticompetitive character of an inherently suspect restraint.'"" Id. "
1063,3," Queen City Pizza relied upon several decisions: See, e.g., TV Communications Network, Inc. v. Turner Network Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1025 (10th Cir.1992) 
(affirming district court's dismissal of claim for failure to plead a relevant market; proposed relevant market consisting of 
only one specific television channel defined too narrowly); Tower Air, Inc. v. Federal Exp. Corp., 956 F.Supp. 270 
(E.D.N.Y.1996) (""Because a relevant market includes all products that are reasonably interchangeable, plaintiff's failure to 
define its market by reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability is, standing alone, valid grounds for dismissal.""); 
B.V. Optische Industrie De Oude Delft v. Hologic, Inc., 909 F.Supp. 162 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (dismissal for failure to plead a 
valid relevant market; plaintiffs failed to define market in terms of reasonable interchangeability or explain rationale 
underlying narrow proposed market definition); Re-Alco Industries, Inc. v. Nat'l Center for Health Educ., Inc., 812 F.Supp. 
387 (S.D.N.Y.1993) (dismissal for failure to plead a valid relevant market; plaintiff failed to allege that specific health 
education product was unique or explain why product was not part of the larger market for health education materials); E. & 
G. Gabriel v. Gabriel Bros., Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9455, No. 93 Civ. 0894, 1994 WL 369147 (S.D.N.Y.1994) 
(dismissal for failure to plead valid relevant market; proposed relevant market legally insufficient because it clearly 
contained varied items with no cross-elasticity of demand). "
1064,," Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436-37."
1064,4," By reason of the plaintiffs raising for the first time on appeal the claim that Domino's had monopolized the ""market for 
reasonably interchangeable franchise opportunities facing prospective franchisees"" in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 
the court of appeals did not decide issues relating to that claim. Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436. "
1065,5," Queen City Pizza cited the following decisions in support: United Farmers Agents Ass'n, Inc. v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 89 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 1996) (""Economic power derived from 
contractual arrangements such as franchises or in this case, the agents' contract with Farmers', has nothing to do with 
market power, ultimate consumers' welfare, or antitrust."") (internal citation and quotation omitted), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 
1116, 117 S. Ct. 960, 136 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1997); Ajir v. Exxon Corp., No. C 93-20830, 1995 WL 429234, at *3 (N.D.Ca. July 
7, 1995) (""Just because Exxon's direct serve dealers may contractually purchase gasoline from only one source -- Exxon -- 
does not mean that the relevant market is Exxon gasoline""; the correct relevant market is all gasoline)). Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 438. "
1069,6," The majority's opinion in Arnold that a supplier's imposition of territorial restrictions on a distributor was ""so obviously 
destructive of competition"" as to constitute a per se violation was later overturned. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 
433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) (overruling the per se rule for non-price vertical restrictions set forth in 
Arnold in favor of the rule of reason approach). See State Oil v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 11, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) 
(discussing Arnold)."
1069,7," 15 U.S.C.A. § 13 (a) provides in relevant part: HN24[

or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or place 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination other may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . . "
1073,1," The original complaint identified plaintiff as ""Richard"" Wilson. Because the notice of appeal and the briefs filed on plaintiff's

complaint""); (3) Williams v. General Motors Corp., et al., Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Burlington County, Docket 
No. L-1978-03 (hereinafter, ""the Williams complaint""); and (4) Tatte v. General Motors Corp., et al., Superior Court of New 
Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, Docket No. L-4421-03 (hereinafter, ""the Tatte complaint""). The venue of the Williams 
action, originally filed in Burlington County, was transferred to Camden County, see R. 4:3-3(a)(3), and all four of the complaints 
were consolidated in Camden County, see R. 4:38-1(a), utilizing the Wilson action as the lead case, under Consolidated Docket 
Number CAM-L-1287-03."
1074,5," Technically, only the Williams and Tatte complaints raised the violation of the Antitrust Act as a separately-denominated cause 
of action. In contrast, the Wilson and Kaufman complaints asserted a single cause of action, based on the Consumer Fraud Act. 
In those  [*7] complaints, however, plaintiffs included a general allegation that defendants' acts were a conspiracy in violation of 
the Antitrust Act and that the violation of that statute also constituted an unconscionable practice within the contemplation of the 
Consumer Fraud Act, along with the separately-pleaded cause of action based on a traditional description of the Consumer 
Fraud Act's elements. The motion judge addressed the consolidated complaints as if they raised these allegations as two counts 
for relief, granting defendants' motion for dismissal as to each. Although plaintiffs do not appeal from the dismissal of the 
Antitrust Act count, the relationship between the Consumer Fraud Act allegations and the antitrust claims cannot be overlooked. "
1076,6," Much of the history relating to Illinois Brick and its relevance to antitrust actions here in New Jersey is discussed in our recent 
opinion in Sickles v. Cabot Corp., 379 N.J. Super. 100, 877 A.2d 267 (App. Div.), certif. denied, 185 N.J. 297, 884 A.2d 1267 
(2005). The motion judge here did not have the benefit of the decision in Sickles, which was published after his October 3, 2003 
order, and which counsel for the parties to this appeal called to our attention pursuant to R. 2:6-11(d). We summarize the salient 
aspects of Illinois Brick and its relationship to the issues that are raised in this appeal for the purpose of clarity, particularly in 
light of the significance of that  [*17] body of law and its relevance to plaintiffs' abandonment of their private antitrust remedy, 
both of which bear upon the question posed on appeal as to the viability of a proposed cause of action, based on the same 
allegations of anticompetitive behavior, pursuant to the Consumer Fraud Act. "
1077,7," A complete list of these jurisdictions can be found in our decision in Sickles, supra, 379 N.J. Super. at 109 n.1. "
1078,8," The two decisions relied upon by the parties were Kieffer v. Mylan Labs, Inc., No. BER-L-365-99-EM (Law Div. 1999), and 
Cement Masons Local Union  [*25] No. 699 v. Mylan Labs, Inc., No. MER-L-431-99 (Law Div. 2000). We decline, in light of R. 
1:36-3, to further address these unpublished decisions. Instead, we rely, consistent with the applicable rule, on published 
precedents and on our own analysis of the judge's reasoning. "
1079,," We note as well that the judge was aware of a related multidistrict litigation complaint then pending in federal court and that he 
declined to await the outcome of a similar motion that had been filed in that matter. Although that motion has since been decided 
and the parties have called it to our attention, see In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litigation, 350 F. Supp. 
2d 160 (D. Me. 2004), we need not address it in light of the fact that the federal judge's dismissal of the New Jersey claims was 
based on his analysis of our Antitrust Act. His comments about our Consumer Fraud Act are not relevant to our analysis. "
1085,1," Specifically, NAMI urges the Court to strike: 1) Exhibit B in its entirety; 2) PP 31-34 of the amended complaint, which are based 
on Exhibit B; 3) Exhibit E in its entirety; and 4) the first five sentences of P44 of the amended complaint, which are based on 
Exhibit E. Exhibits B and E are internal memoranda by grocery stores to their division managers, which Insignia uses to support 
its allegations that those stores are coordinating with NAMI to boycott Insignia. It is undisputed that NAMI produced these 
documents during discovery in the New York litigation. As an initial matter, Insignia argues that NAMI's motions to strike are untimely because NAMI filed the motions 96 days after 
filing its motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g) (providing that all motions under Rule 12 must be made together to prevent 
waiver, unless the motion falls within one of the enumerated exceptions of Rule 12(h)(2)). The Court concludes that NAMI 
preserved the motions by noting its intention to file them in its motion to dismiss."
1085,2," Specifically, NAMI urges the Court to strike: 1) P18 in its entirety; 2) Exhibit A, which supports the allegations in P18; 3) the 
second sentence of P19; 4) PP28 and 29, in their entirety, and 5) the last sentence of P53. NAMI argues that paragraphs 18, 19, 
28, and 29 of the amended complaint improperly allege the same conduct that Insignia alleged in the 2000 litigation. Paragraph "
1086,53," explains that ""no successful entry has occurred in"" the in-store advertising and promotions products market in the last eight 
years. "
1089,3," Albertsons focuses on the small market share occupied by Albertsons, but this focus is inappropriate because Insignia alleges 
a conspiracy among the grocery retailers. At the pleading stage, it is sufficient to plead that defendants as a group have 
substantial market power. See Baxley-Delamar Monuments, Inc. v. American Cemetery Ass'n, 843 F.2d 1154, 1157 (8th Cir. 
1988) (analyzing ""collective market share"" in a motion to dismiss). "
1096,1," The only private right of action conferred on the general public by C.R.S. § 12-6-122(2) to sue manufacturers or distributors is 
for losses suffered by reason of a violation of C.R.S. § 12-6-120(1)(a), which deals with willful failures to perform under written 
warranties."
1096,2," Despite defendant's assertion as to the impact of the Salco and Sylvania cases, the Supreme Court itself stated in Continental 
T.V. that ""[t]his Court has never given plenary consideration to the question of the proper antitrust analysis of location 
restrictions,"" acknowledging without necessarily embracing as a holding that ""[s]ince the decision in [United States v. Amold 
Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249 (1967)] location restrictions have been sustained by three 
Courts of Appeals,"" including the decision in Salco. 433 U.S. at 42 n.11. "
1097,3," The Court notes that the allegations in Paragraph 35 of the Amended Complaint regarding the alleged ""market allocation 
agreement"" between the Porsche dealers as to dividing up the market and not competing on price, the allegation in Paragraph 
36 of the Amended Complaint of a ""conspiracy"" between PCNA and the dealers, and the allegations in Paragraphs 64 and 69 of 
the Amended Complaint, alleging per se violations, were not pled in the original complaint. "
1101,4," The comment on Clause (a) of Section 767 (""the nature of the actor's conduct"") states: ""Conduct specifically in violation of 
statutory provisions or contrary to established public policy may for that reason make an interference improper. This may be 
true, for example, of conduct that is in violation of antitrust provisions or is in restraint of trade or of conduct that is in violation of 
statutes, regulations, or judicial or administrative holdings regarding labor relations."""
1101,5," The comment on Clause (b) of Section 767 (""the actor's motive"") specifically states: ""In determining whether the interference is 
improper, it may become very important to ascertain whether the actor was motivated, in whole or in part, by a desire to interfere 
with the other's contractual relations. If this was the sole motive the interference is almost certain to be held improper. A motive 
to injure another or to vent one's ill will on him serves no socially useful purpose."" "

] A multiple dwelling unit is defined as ""an apartment building, condominium building, or cooperative."" 47 C.F.R. §"
1109,76, .800(a). 
1113,2," Prior to the 2001 amendment, this cause of action was limited to ""consumers."""
1113,3," Plaintiff also utilizes contracts with its MDU customers which include exclusivity provisions, but characterizes its contracts as 
being qualitatively different."
1113,4," The only mainland Collier County area within the relevant geographic market would be La Peninsula, but there is no claim that 
Comcast had an exclusive contract with that MDU. "
1114,5," The exclusivity contracts only affect delivery of cable services to MDUs, not to single family homes. "
1115,6," Eastern R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United 
Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1115,7," Eastern R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (granting 
antitrust immunity for publicity campaign designed to spur the adoption of monopoly-facilitating legislation); United Mine Workers 
v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) (noting that Noerr shielded a defendant from antitrust 
liability for ""efforts to influence public officials . . . even though intended to eliminate competition""). "
1116,8," The Eleventh Circuit has held that alleged misrepresentations to the government agency ""acting judicially"" in making a decision 
is are not entitled to Noerr immunity. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc. v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 795 F.2d 948, 955 (11th Cir. 1986). The 
allegedly false statements in this case were not made to such a government agency or to the state court. "
1119,1," Defendants include the owners and operators of ZWT: Harminder Bhasin, Rameet Bhasin, Gurvinder Bindra, John Iannotti, 
Ray Kissel, Asif Jamal, and Kelli Burke. "
1121,2," Any appeal taken in a case arising under the patent laws will go to the Federal Circuit rather than a numbered Circuit Court 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). Consequently, Federal Circuit opinions concerning patent law are binding on this Court. "
1122,3," ZWT requests leave of this Court to replead this counterclaim. (05-3892, Oral Argument Transcript, May 18, 2006 at 15.) That 
request is denied as this counterclaim is wholly improper and cannot be made proper in subsequent pleadings. "
1128,1," The Amended Complaint also names the City of Key West (the ""City"") as a Defendant in this suit seeking, in addition to the 
state civil antitrust claims, redress under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for an alleged violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. The claims 
against the City are the subject of a separate motion to dismiss, and shall be addressed by separate order."
1128,2," Section 12 of Ordinance 95-4 states ""the City shall not issue any other occupational licenses, franchises, or pass any ordinance 
similar to this Ordinance, and does hereby prohibit sightseeing or shuttle services or any other similar type of operation . . . from 
having offices. depots, load or unload passengers, sell tickers or promote their business within 1,000 feet of the Grantee's 
[Train's] existing depots.'"
1128,3," Section 12 of Ordinance 95-5 states ""the City shall not issue any other occupational licenses, franchises, or pass any ordinance 
similar to this Ordinance, and does hereby prohibit sightseeing or shuttle services or any other similar type of operation . . . from 
having offices, depots, load or unload passengers, sell tickers or promote their business within 1.000 feet of the Grantee's 
[Buggy's] existing depots. "
1132,4," Again, even if Mr. Morgan's intent was to restrain trade in favor of Train and Buggy through a series of misrepresentations to 
the City Commission, the doctrine 'applies regardless of the petitioning party's intent or purpose. See Pennington, 381 U.S. at 
670: Andrx Pharmaceuticals, 76 F.3d at 1573. "
1135,1," Because this Court lacks jurisdiction, it declines to discuss, in any depth, Plaintiff's venue argument. It suffices to note that 
Plaintiff's attempt to invoke 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(3), which authorizes venue in a district where any defendant is found if no other 
district is available, is unavailing, since venue lies in another district -- namely, Tennessee -- under § 1391(b)(2) (""a judicial 
district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred""). "
1140,1," Depository also requests that if its motion is granted the Court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining 
state law claims."

claim was properly granted where the subject of an alleged false advertisement was a competing product that did not exist)."
1148,83," The fourth element is satisfied by the allegation that the misrepresentations likely damaged Chapdelaine's business and 
property interests as a result of the cessation of negotiations with potential licensees. See Compl. P32."

1149,1, This disposition is not designated for publication and may not be cited. 
1155,2," A related problem is that Kinderstart has not sufficiently described the markets relevant to its claim. It is unclear how the Search 
Engine Market (described as the ""market of search engine design, implementation and usage"") is separable from the Search Ad 
Market (described as the ""market of search-driven Internet advertising""), see FAC PP 113, 114, and Kinderstart does not 
describe the characteristics of the Website Ranking Market. See FAC P 115. In the absence of an adequate description of the 
Website Ranking Market, Kinderstart has not alleged facts that would establish Google's monopoly power in such a market. 
""Monopoly power, for the purpose of section 2 of the Sherman Act, is 'the power to control prices or exclude competition.'"" 
Forsyth, 114 F.3d at 1475. Kinderstart has identified neither prices nor potential competitors in the Website Ranking Market. "
1156,3," Although the Supreme Court has declined either to endorse or repudiate the ""essential facilities"" doctrine, see Verizon 
Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis v. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823, the Ninth Circuit 
has recently applied it in MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124 (9th Cir. 2004). "
1157,4," Insofar as Kinderstart alleges that the AdSense agreement encompasses PageRanks and Results Page listings, such 
allegations would tend to support a breach of contract claim rather than an anti-trust claim."
1157,5," See Official Airline Guides, Inc. v. F. T. C., 630 F.2d 920 (2d Cir. 1980) (upholding right of monopolist publisher of airline guides 
to discriminate without justification between large air carriers and commuter airlines in production of flight guide). However, in 
that case, the monopolist (as a publisher, rather than an airline) was not alleged to be in direct competition with the parties 
harmed by the conduct. Id. In the instant case, Kinderstart has alleged that it directly competes with Google in the Search Ad 
Market and the Search Engine Market."
1157,6," See Jefferson County School Dist. No. R-1 v. Moody's Investor's Services, Inc., 175 F.3d 848 (10th Cir. 1999). In Jefferson, a 
financial services company's published article stating a ""negative outlook"" for school district bonds was found to be protected 
expression. Id. Jefferson followed the Supreme Court's holding in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 110 S. Ct. 2695, 
111 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1990) that, regarding media defendants, ""a statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern which 
does not contain a provably false factual connotation will receive full constitutional protection."" Id. at 20. Without deciding the 
merits of Google's argument, the Court notes that Jefferson County may be distinguishable because (a) Google is not a media 
defendant and (b) website ranking may be of little or no public concern in comparison with municipal bond ratings."
1157,7," The Federal Communications Commission has defined ""enhanced service"" as follows: ""[E]nhanced service"" shall refer to services, offered over common carrier transmission facilities used in interstate 
communications, which employ computer processing applications that act on the format, content, code, protocol or similar 
aspects of the subscriber's transmitted information; provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; 
or involve subscriber interaction with stored information."
1157,47, C.F.R. 64.702(a). 
1158,8," California Business and Professions Code § 17045 states: The secret payment or allowance of rebates, refunds, commissions, or unearned discounts, whether in the form of money 
or otherwise, or secretly extending to certain purchasers special services or privileges not extended to all purchasers 
purchasing upon like terms and conditions, to the injury of a competitor and where such payment or allowance tends to 
destroy competition, is unlawful. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17045. "
1159,9," Kinderstart alleges only that it is a member of Google's AdSense program, through which it shares revenue from Google ads 
placed on Kinderstart's site. FAC P 21."
1159,10," The AdSense agreement is properly before this court under the Ninth Circuit's ""incorporation by reference"" doctrine because 
Kinderstart makes reference to the ""AdSense Program Agreement"" and its terms in P 87 of its FAC, makes reference to the 
existence of such an agreement in PP 21, 75, 83, 86, 172, and 174 of the FAC, and has not disputed the authenticity of the 
agreement. See In re Silicon Graphics, Inc. Securities Litigation, 183 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 1999). ""Under the 'incorporation by 
reference' rule of this Circuit, a court may look beyond the pleadings without converting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one for 
summary judgment."" Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2002). "
1160,11," Google suggested at oral argument that an average viewer of a PageRank would understand it to be a matter of opinion, 
rather than a statement of fact, and thus would not understand it to be defamatory. "
1164,1," Hynix's fifth, sixth and seventh claims for relief allege breach of contract, breach of contract by third party beneficiary, and 
breach of contract by promissory estoppel, respectively, and Hynix's eighth and ninth claims for relief allege actual fraud and 
constructive fraud, respectively."
1164,2," Hynix was formerly known as Hyundai Electronics Industries, Ltd. References to Hynix in this order refers also to Hyundai 
Electronics Industries, Ltd."
1164,3," Rambus began licensing the RDRAM technology even before the patents for the RDRAM were issued. Vega Decl., Ex. 19 at R 
46400-04, R46422; Ex. 20 at R 169939; Ex. 21; Ex. 22 at R 2970373; Ex. 23."
1164,4, JEDEC is now known as the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association. 
1165,5, Richard Crisp was an employee of Rambus and served as Rambus's representative at JEDEC.
1165,6," The parties do not dispute that JEDEC had not yet started discussions or development of any standards for the DDR SDRAM 
technology at this September 1993 meeting. "
1166,7," ""Clock"" refers to the periodic electronic signals used to coordinate the actions of circuits. ""Use of both edges of the clock"" refers 
to a design whereby data is transferred on both the rise (high state) and fall (low state) of the clock to achieve greater bandwidth. 
DLL and PLL refer to a circuit design feature that synchronizes the clock signals of the various circuits, allowing increased 
performance speeds. These features were later made part of the DDR standard."
1166,8," Rambus may have withdrawn from JEDEC earlier in 1996, but its formal letter of withdrawal was dated June 1996."
1166,9," In particular, the SyncLink device was designed with a ""narrow multiplexed bus interface with a packetized communications 
protocol,"" Rambus refers to this type of DRAM device as the RamLink. "
1167,10," Hynix asserts, and Rambus does not appear to dispute, that the ""Other DRAM"" provision was intended to cover the SLDRAM 
and also applies to SDRAM. Hynix's Opp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 14. "
1170,11," Virginia law was applicable in the Infineon case. Under Virginia law, whether there is a duty is a question of fact."
1170,12," The Rambus patents at issue in the Infineon suit were U.S. Patent Nos. 5,954,804; 5,953,263; 6,034,918; and 6,032,214. "
1171,13," This is distinguished from allegations of negligent misrepresentation which require an affirmative assertion. See Wilson v. 
Century 21 Great Western Realty, 15 Cal. App. 4th 298, 306, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 779 (1993). Hynix's SAC does not assert a claim 
of negligent misrepresentation."
1171,14," It is immaterial whether the alleged infringed patents were issued, pending or planned. The crux of the issue is whether 
Rambus knowingly omitted facts material to Hynix when it chose to disclose that SLDRAM devices likely infringed Rambus 
patent in the course of preliminary contract negotiations related to the alternative DRAM technologies. Notably, Hynix had 
indicated a clear preference to know whether it had to pay royalties to Rambus. See, e.g., Vega Decl., Ex. 22. Rambus has not 
otherwise explained why it needed to disclose the potential infringement of SLDRAM but not SDRAM (and later DDR SDRAM), 
including after it had entered in the License Agreement with Hynix. "
1172,15," Notably, this would be consistent with JEDEC's overall policy to avoid standardizing technology subject to patents and to 
promulgate open standards. "
1173,16," The court also held that Rambus's disclosure of the '703 patent satisfied any duty to disclose technologies described but not 
claimed in its patents or applications. Infineon, 318 F.3d at 1100. "
1181,1," In his response to defendants' motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 12), plaintiff clarifies this allegation by stating that his letter informed 
the Department of Justice that it could avoid procedural problems when settling claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act by 
using a qualified settlement fund. Plaintiff claims that Allstate concluded this would harm its business and fired him on that basis. "
1182,2,"  HN2[
] The burden is on plaintiff to plead that he was an at-will employee at the time of his discharge, as this is an essential 
element of a Burk claim. McCrady v. Okla. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2005 OK 67, 122 P.3d 473, 475 (Okla. 2005). "
1183,3,"  HN10[
] Recent precedent of the United States Supreme Court unequivocally states that the key inquiry when determining 
whether a statute implies a private right of action is legislative intent. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286-87, 121 S. 
Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001) (""The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it 
displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.""); Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 
575, 99 S. Ct. 2479, 61 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1979) (""The central inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly 
or by implication, a private cause of action.""). In Holbert, the Oklahoma Supreme Court cited this reasoning as persuasive when 
considering whether a statute contains an implied private right of action. "
1184,4," Plaintiff had previously asserted antitrust claims under the Clayton Act, but in his response to defendants' motion to dismiss, he 
abandoned those claims. "
1185,5,"  Plaintiff makes a general argument that he has suffered an antitrust injury under Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 
429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), which requires the plaintiff to prove that an antitrust injury flows from the 
defendant's unlawful conduct and that plaintiff's injury ""reflect[s] the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. at 489. However, plaintiff specifically bases his antitrust injury and 
defendants' alleged unlawful conduct on the presence of an illegal tie-in, so there is no need to consider this argument 
separately. "
1192,1," Defendant does not dispute that, if the market is limited to automated devices, it possessed monopoly power. "
1199,1," Prior to starting Medi-Temp, Mr. Evans was President and an employee of Medical Specialties of California Manufacturing, Inc. 
(""MSCM""), the predecessor company to Thera-Med."
1199,2," CVS has adopted all of Thera-Med's responses to Medi-Temp's motions. The Court notes its frustration with the manner in 
which Thera-Med and CVS have responded to Medi-Temp's motions. Instead of filing one response to each motion or a single 
consolidated response to all motions, Thera-Med and CVS reorganized the substance of the eleven (11) motions, combining "
1200,," them into a set of four (4) substantive responses. While Thera-Med and CVS may have had reason to respond in such a 
manner, they are strongly discouraged from repeating such a practice in the future before this Court. "
1204,3," While Thera-Med and CVS argue in the response that CVS relied on the alleged false statements when it sent a letter to Thera-
Med requesting a response to the statements, even were the Court to consider such evidence outside of the pleadings, there is 
no allegation that CVS was damaged in any way by its claimed reliance."
1204,4," The Court notes that the fraud counterclaims appear to address alleged false statements made to and relied upon by third 
parties, not Thera-Med or CVS. For example, Thera-Med and CVS allege that ""[a]s a result of Plaintiff's false representations 
and the detrimental reliance on those representations by consumers, manufacturers, and vendors, Thera-Med [and CVS] 
suffered damage to [their] business."" Generally, a plaintiff ""must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his 
claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties."" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 
343 (1975) (citations omitted). "
1205,5," As with the fraud counterclaims, the Court notes that the negligent misrepresentation counterclaims appear to address alleged 
negligent misrepresentations made to and relied upon by third parties, not Thera-Med or CVS. For example, Thera-Med and 
CVS allege that ""[a]s a result of Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentations and the detrimental reliance upon the false or incorrect 
information provided to consumers, manufacturers, and vendors of hot/cold therapy products, Thera-Med [and CVS] suffered 
damage to [their] business."""
1205,6," Thera-Med specifically identifies three communications it contends evidence Medi-Temp's false and defamatory statements of 
patent infringement. "
1211,1," In the district court the suit included several other claims and counter-claims which are not properly before this court, including 
state-law claims for breach of contract, detrimental reliance, fraud, and misrepresentation and five counter-claims for unpaid 
accounts. The district court bifurcated these claims, ruling only on liability and reserving the damages question for a later trial. 
Then, citing Rule 54(b), the district court purported to certify for appeal its ruling on liability. Because Rule 54(b) permits the 
certification of final judgments only, we ruled ineffective the certification and ordered dismissed all appeals and cross-appeals 
relating to the state law claims. See Order of April 28, 2006, as modified by Order of May 2, 2006. These state-law claims 
remain pending before the district court; only the Robinson-Patman Act claim is before us on this appeal. Sidag 
Aktiengesellschaft v. Smoked Foods Products Co., Inc., 813 F.2d 81, 84 (5th Cir. 1987); see also Wright and Miller § 2656. "
1212,2," HN2[
] In price discrimination cases, courts analyze the competitive injury component at three basic levels: (1) primary-line 
effects, i.e. injury to other sellers; (2) secondary-line effects, i.e. injury to purchasers of a certain seller; and (3) tertiary-line 
effects, i.e. injury to the customers of those purchasers. A secondary-line violation occurs when a large purchaser uses its 
purchasing power to obtain lower prices from a manufacturer, allowing it to undersell its competitors. Eximco, Inc. v. Trane, 737 
F.2d 505, 515 (5th Cir. 1984)."
1212,3," At the time, OMC manufactured Johnson and Evinrude outboard motors."
1212,4," Section 2(b) provides HN4[
] that ""[u]pon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has 
been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing 
justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, 
the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained 
shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or 
facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or 
facilities furnished by a competitor."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 13(b). "
1213,5," The district court also ruled that Water Craft had failed to prove its prima facie case under § 2(a), but because we affirm on the 
basis of the meeting competition defense, we need not address these other rulings. "
1214,6," The Court has held that the exchange of price information by competitors violates the Sherman Act. United States v. Container 
Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 89 S.Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969), and has often explained that this risk of liability circumscribes the 
efforts which a seller may undertake to verify a competing offer. See e.g., United States Gypsum Co., 98 S.Ct. at 2884. "
1217,1, This disposition is not designated for publication and may not be cited. 
1221,2, The Court held that the claim for common law misappropriation of trade secrets was preempted by the CUTSA.
1221,3," However, as discussed below, the Court concludes that AirDefense has failed to allege adequately the elements of this claim. "
1227,1," Plaintiffs' fifth argument, that the Court's order allowed them to amend interrogatory responses through December 16, 2005, is 
now moot because no such amendments have been filed. In any event, such amendments would only have been timely under 
the Court's order if based on newly discovered evidence. No newly discovered evidence is apparent."
1227,2," For purposes of clarity, the Court will distinguish between the ""10% objective,"" which MBUSA admits, and the ""10% theory,"" 
which MBUSA denies and alleges is being posited for the first time in plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment. The ""objective"" 
is MBUSA's 10% retained gross profit target for its dealership network and the ""theory"" is plaintiffs' contention that the objective 
was the goal of the alleged price-fixing scheme. In plaintiffs' own words, ""[t]he [Sheft Kahn] group's goal was to increase profits 
to the minimum retained gross profit of 10%, which was also the mutual goal of MBUSA and its dealers."" (Pl.'s Summ. J. Opp'n 
Br. at 37.) "
1230,3," Most lessors are members of the class, but not MBCC. This is because the class definition excludes ""the defendant MBUSA, its 
parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and employees."" (Compl. at P 19.) MBCC's exclusion means that lessees who leased through 
MBCC stand in a somewhat different position from those who leased through lessor class-members. "
1233,4," In United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 L. Ed. 992, 1919 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 460 (1919), the Supreme 
Court held that a ""manufacturer can announce its resale prices in advance and fail to deal with those who fail to comply. And a 
distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination."" Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761. "
1234,5," ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and 
those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Bus. Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. at 
730."
1234,6," To establish a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act under the rule of reason, a plaintiff must generally prove: ""'(1) that the 
defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other; (2) that the combination or conspiracy produced adverse, 
anti-competitive effects within the relevant geographic markets; (3) that the objects of and the conduct pursuant to that contract 
or conspiracy were illegal; and (4) that the plaintiffs were injured as a proximate result of that conspiracy.'"" Rossi, 156 F.3d at 
464-65 (quoting Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482, 1489 (3d Cir. 1985)). Under a per se analysis, prongs two 
and three are conclusively presumed. Id. ""[T]here is presumption in favor of a rule of reason standard"" and ""departure from that 
standard must be justified by some demonstrable economic effect, such as the facilitation of cartelizing."" Bus. Elecs. Corp., 485 
U.S. at 726."
1234,7," In a slightly different and more fully explicated form, ""[w]hen dealer interests rather than manufacturer interests appear to be 
served, many courts describe a vertical restraint as ""horizontal,"" even in the absence of collective action by dealers. Such a 
classification is meant to express a finding that the restraint before the court serves a dealer's desire for excess profits rather 
than a possible manufacturer's desire for more efficient distribution through, for example, point-of-sale services."" II Phillip E. 
Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P2000b (2d ed. 2005). "
1235,8," The Third Circuit has also held that ""a conspiracy is horizontal in nature when a number of competitor firms agree with each 
other and at least one of their common suppliers or manufacturers to eliminate their price-cutting competition by cutting his 
access to supplies."" Rossi, 156 F.3d at 462; accord Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1376 (same result where ""a number"" of 
automobile dealers conspired with a manufacturer to form a group boycott). Both cases emphasize the involvement of multiple 
downstream participants in the conspiracy. This Court, in an earlier opinion by Judge Wolin, cited Rossi to support its 
determination that ""it is proper to analyze the entire restraint as one of horizontal price-fixing."" In re Mercedes Benz Antitrust 
Litig., 157 F. Supp. 2d 355, 362 (D.N.J. 2001). Rossi and Big Apple BMW are not necessarily dispositive of the issue, however, 
because in those cases it was the horizontal dealer cartel that pushed for the boycott, thereby ""producing"" the restraint. In this 
case, plaintiffs do not allege that the dealer cartel coerced MBUSA's participation."
1235,9," The Court makes this determination cautiously, however, because ""the horizontal label perniciously invites the tribunal to forgo 
analyzing the policies underlying"" the per se characterization, ""disposing of the case merely by citing precedents condemning 
genuine horizontal conspiracies between competitors."" II Phillip E. Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1604 (2d 
ed. 2004). It is to avoid this danger that the Court examines MBUSA's role as a vertical restraint, as well. "
1236,10," In this regard, the Court is aware of testimony by Tamim Shansab that the dealers were ""free to do anything [they] want"" with 
regard to prices. That statement was qualified by ""with the exception of the pressures that were brought upon us by Mercedes-
Benz,"" however. (Cooper Cert. Ex. 45 at 1253.) Evidence in the record indicates that such pressure involved sticking as close to 
MSRP as possible, pursuant to the dealers' agreement."
1236,11," While the Court is well aware that many prominent commentators have strongly criticized the per se illegality of vertical 
minimum price-fixing agreements, see, e.g., Pace Elecs. v. Canon Computer Sys., 213 F.3d 118, 123 n.4 (3d Cir. 2000); Robert 
H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 281 (1978), those concerns are today left for academic debate. In this case, there is evidence to 
support plaintiffs' allegation that MBUSA agreed with its dealers to maintain price levels as close to MSRP as possible. Whether 
there are procompetitive reasons behind MBUSA's alleged actions that improved interbrand competition is not an inquiry that the 
Court may now undertake. The Supreme Court has continually reaffirmed that retail price maintenance is a per se violation of 
the Sherman Act and the evidence in the record here supports the inference that MBUSA engaged in such practice in 
coordination with a horizontal dealer cartel. "
1238,12, MBUSA also makes this argument in its motion for summary judgment. MBUSA's argument is likewise rejected.
1238,13," The reverse is usually true, however, as ""the general rule is well established that a corporation is charged with constructive 
knowledge, regardless of actual knowledge, of all material facts of which its officer or agent receives notice or acquires 
knowledge while acting in the course of employment."" 3 William Meade Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private 
Corporations § 790 (perm. ed., rev. vol. 2002). "
1243,*, This is amended to correct the formatting of the trademarks. 
1264,1," SLAPP is an acronym for “strategic lawsuit against public participation.” ( Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal.4th 
728, 732, fn. 1 [3 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 74 P.3d 737].) All further unspecified statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. "
1265,2, The parties were given an opportunity to brief the applicability of section 425.18 to the instant case.
1265,3," Review of an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section 425.16 is de novo. ( Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo 
Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1056 [18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 882].) We consider “the pleadings, and 
supporting and opposing affidavits … upon which the liability or defense is based.” (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(2).) However, we neither 
“weigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff 
[citation] and evaluate the defendant's evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of 
law.” ( HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 786].)"
1265,4, Hafif denied Soukup's version of their exchange. 
1266,5," Hafif successfully demurred to Terrie Hutton's action. It was dismissed without leave to amend and sanctions of $ 25,000 were 
imposed upon her and Sales for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. On appeal, however, the judgment was reversed in part, as was the 
sanctions order. Barajas and Killingsworth voluntarily dismissed their actions against Hafif without prejudice because they had 
been filed by Sales without their authorization. Hafif prevailed against Schielke and Jones on their complaint and was awarded $ 
31,196.60 on his cross-complaint. Represented by Benson, Schielke later filed a second action against LOHH, Hafif and 
Attorney Ronald Stock for malpractice. In November 2000, following a court trial, judgment was entered in favor of defendants. "
1267,6," Soukup later filed a cross-complaint for declaratory relief against LOHH and Hafif in the event that the underlying action 
resulted in suits by former clients against her based on allegations of misconduct by LOHH and Hafif in cases on which Soukup 
had assisted. Hafif demurred to the cross-complaint and the demurrer was granted without leave to amend, but also without 
prejudice to refiling in the event that Soukup was sued by a former client."
1267,7, Stock denied having made this statement. 
1268,8," The Terrie Hutton “diaries,” which figure prominently in this case, were hundreds of pages of handwritten and typed notes 
made by Hutton documenting her communications with other former clients of Hafif and with her attorney, Sasson Sales, in the 
period prior to the filing of the former clients' actions against Hafif. The same Court of Appeal opinion that affirmed the order 
striking the underlying action as a SLAPP against Soukup also affirmed the order striking the underlying action as a SLAPP 
against Hutton. "
1271,9," Defendants request that we take judicial notice of the legislative history surrounding Assembly Bill No. 1158 (2005–2006 Reg. 
Sess.). ( Martin v. Szeto (2004) 32 Cal.4th 445, 452, fn. 9 [9 Cal. Rptr. 3d 687, 84 P.3d 374].) Soukup objects to the extent that 
some of the legislative history reflects the views of individual legislators or advocates of the legislation rather than the Legislature 
as a whole. (See  Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 38–39 [34 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 520].) The legislative history in this case is relatively brief and our citation to it is limited to various versions of the 
legislation and committee reports, all of which are indisputably proper subjects of judicial notice. ( Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title 
Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 45, fn. 9 [77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 709, 960 P.2d 513].) Therefore, we grant defendants' request for 
judicial notice of the legislative history material. Defendants also request that we take judicial notice of materials in the case of 
Hutton v. Hafif (May 11, 2004, B162572) (nonpub. opn.) review denied, July 28, 2004, S125728, including the Court of Appeal's 
opinion in that case and in proceedings that followed our denial of review. These materials are not relevant to any issue in this 
case and the request is denied. "
1272,10," The parties do not contend to the contrary, except for Stock who purports to find in the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 
1158 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) an indication that the Legislature considered, but rejected, prospective application of the section 
by deleting language that stated an intent “to apply this amendment to cases pending at the time this act is adopted.” This 
language, however, was in the context of an amendment to section 425.16, subdivision (f), not to section 425.18. (Assem. Com. 
on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1158 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) as introduced, Feb. 22, 2005, p. 7.) Therefore, it has no 
bearing on whether section 425.18 applies to pending cases. "
1273,11," Indeed, the legislative history reveals that early versions of Assembly Bill No. 1158 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) specifically 
stated that one object of the SLAPPback amendments to section 425.16 was to overrule the Court of Appeal's opinion in Soukup 
v. Stock; this language did not survive into the final version of section 425.18. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill 
No. 1158 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 22, 2005, p. 7.)"
1273,12," Stock asserts that the law in question must be a criminal statute, but he fails to provide any support for his premise that 
“illegal” refers only to criminal acts or that the Legislature, in enacting section 425.18, intended to refer only to criminal violations. "
1274,13," We address the viability of this exception in the companion to this case, Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299 [46 
Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2]. "
1275,14," Further support for our conclusion that the Legislature's adoption of the phrase “illegal as a matter of law” referred to the Paul 
decision comes in the form of a subsequent Senate Committee on the Judiciary analysis of Assembly Bill No. 1158 (2005–2006 
Reg. Sess.) that explains that this concept was drawn in part from the amicus curiae brief filed by the Attorney General in  
Flatley v. Mauro, supra, 39 Cal.4th 299 wherein the Attorney General argues that the Paul exception is consistent with the 
Legislature's intent in enacting section 425.16. "
1276,15, This section is part of the ERISA statute. (29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.) 
1277,16," Soukup also argues that the illegality of the underlying action is established by the finding of the Court of Appeal that her 
complaint to the Department of Labor was the basis for the underlying action when it affirmed the dismissal of the action as a 
SLAPP. This finding, however, is not the equivalent of a finding that the underlying action was illegal. "
1279,17," The parties made various evidentiary objections to each other's affidavits and the attachments thereto in the trial court, but the 
trial court declined to rule on the objections and neither side pressed for a ruling. Therefore, the objections are deemed to be 
forfeited. ( Gallant v. City of Carson (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 705, 710 [27 Cal. Rptr. 3d 318]), and “in reviewing the trial court's 
order denying the motion, we consider all the evidence presented by the parties.” ( Slauson Partnership v. Ochoa (2003) 112 
Cal.App.4th 1005, 1014, fn. 4 [5 Cal. Rptr. 3d 668].) "
1280,18," Defendants assert that Hafif “withdrew” his malicious claim against Soukup, but fail to show where in the record that cause of 
action was dismissed against her."
1280,19," Defendants cite a declaration from O.J. Freed, a mutual friend of Hafif and Benson’s, in which he states that Benson said 
Soukup had told him that Hafif had accepted bribes “to sell out clients.” Even accepting the declaration at face value, it fails to 
set forth the time, place and circumstances of this conversation between Benson and Soukup nor does it, on its face, support the 
specific causes of action alleged against Soukup by Hafif."
1280,20," In their briefs, defendants also repeatedly purport to incorporate by reference arguments from briefs they filed in the Court of 
Appeal and here in this case and in the Hutton case. They offer no authority that permits such incorporation and nothing in the 
California Rules of Court allows this practice. To the contrary, the relevant rule requires HN25[
] briefs filed in this court to 
conform to rule 14 which governs the content and form of briefs filed in the Court of Appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 28.1(a).) It 
is well settled that the Court of Appeal does not permit incorporation by reference of documents filed in the trial court. ( Colores 
v. Board of Trustees (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1301, fn. 2 [130 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347] [“it is not appropriate to incorporate by 
reference, into a brief, points and authorities contained in trial court papers, even if such papers are made a part of the appellate "
1281,," record”];  Estate of Wiedemann (1964) 228 Cal. App. 2d 362, 370–371 [39 Cal. Rptr. 496] [incorporation by reference of points 
and authorities filed in the trial court violates Cal. Rules of Court, rule 14].) The same principle bars defendants' attempts to 
incorporate by reference arguments advanced in other appellate briefs. We therefore disregard these purported incorporations 
by reference."
1281,21," Accordingly we deny defendants' request to judicially notice the statement of decision in the Schielke case. ( People v. 
Rowland (1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 268, fn. 6 [14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 377, 841 P.2d 897] [reviewing court need not take judicial notice of 
irrelevant court records].)"
1281,22," Moreover, as the Court of Appeal concluded in the appeal affirming the dismissal of the underlying action as a SLAPP against 
Soukup and Hutton, those diaries were properly held to be inadmissible. Defendants make no showing that these diaries would 
be admissible against Soukup on any theory of admissibility. Therefore, no matter how often or insistently defendants attempt to 
rely on these diaries, the inescapable fact is that, as to Soukup, they are and remain inadmissible. "
1284,1," Defendants also assert that if their motion is granted, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the 
remaining state law claims. In any case, defendants argue that most, if not all, of plaintiff's state law claims are barred by the 
doctrine of res judicata as a result of prior proceedings before a New Jersey administrative agency. "

1298,3," There is no indication in the Third Amended Complaint or elsewhere in the record of the basis or nature of Plaintiff's disability 
retirement claim, when it was made, denied, the outcome and bases therefor, or whether an appeal was taken and/or 
administrative  [*8] remedies exhausted. Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts to show that the denial of his statutory right to 
short-term and long-term disability retirement benefits is properly before this Court. Moreover, in all likelihood, the denial of 
disability retirement benefits is governed exclusively by ERISA. Therefore, to the extent any of Plaintiff's claims includes an 
allegation of injury and/or damages predicated on the denial of his ""statutory right to short-term and long-term disability 
retirement benefits,"" the Court will disregard such allegations and recommends all such references/allegations be 
stricken/dismissed from the Third Amended Complaint."
1298,4," The articles to which Plaintiff is referring were published in the JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL & ENVIRONMENTAL 
MEDICINE (""JOEM"") in June of 1999 and 2000, and were authored by a number of medical doctors and/or PhDs, including the 
Defendants. (Ex. 10 and Ex. 11 to Pl.'s Mot. for More Definite Statement, and Mot. to Strike (Doc. 27-2, pgs. 17-22).) Plaintiff 
also refers to a third JOEM article, but the Court is unable to determine the title, authors or date of that article from the record. "
1299,5," By way of further background, Plaintiff alleges that ROIICO, an ad hoc committee of the Association of American Railroads (""A 
 [*10] AR"") which was formed in 199 6 allegedly in response to a position statement approved by a majority of the invitees at a 
workshop hosted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (""NIOSH"") in November, 1996, conspired with its 
counsel and the Defendants to set up and conduct fraudulent DMEs. (TAC ¶¶ 10, 23-24, 27, 36, 47.) The NIOSH position 
statement found, in effect, that TSE is an occupational disease which required human research to measure the incidence of TSE 
in various occupations and to identify dispositive TSE-diagnostic techniques and treatment. (TAC ¶ 14.) According to Plaintiff, 
the purpose of the fraudulent DMEs was to examine TSE-claimants, to obtain and distort their PMI, which was protected by 42 
U.S.C. § 1320d-6(b), to counter the NIOSH research, to convert said PMI for ROIICO's use by publishing said PMI as ""human 
research"" in three biomedical publications, which either denied the existence of TSE or posited that TSE-patients were 
misdiagnosed psychiatric patients. (TAC ¶¶ 37, 47, 56.) Defendants maintain that Plaintiff fails to recognize that the human research that formed the basis of the JOEM articles involved 
only railroad workers. Indeed, Defendants  [*11] argue that they had not even met Plaintiff at the time the first JOEM article was 
published in June of 1999, as the DME's of Plaintiff did not occur until September 7 and 8, 1999. (Defs.' Reply to Pl.'s Answer to 
Joint Mot. to Dismiss TAC (Doc. 71) at 3 & n.3 (citing Mot. to Strike, Ex. 10; Mot. to Dismiss SAC, Ex. 1 at 8 & 9).)"
1299,6," Plaintiff's complaint was made in a letter dated M arch 15, 2001 addressed to OHRP. See Ex. 20 to Pl.'s Mot. for More Definite 
Statement, and Mot. to Strike Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. 27-3, pgs. 14-15)."
1299,7," Plaintiff contends he learned of OHRP's February 12, 2003 determination on March 16, 2003. (TAC ¶ 61.) By making this 
allegation, Plaintiff appears to be attempting to establish  [*13] the date he ""discovered"" his injuries, thereby establishing that his 
state common law claims were timely filed. In other words, Plaintiff is attempting to show that the statute of limitations did not 
begin to run until March 16, 2003, when he learned of OHRP's findings. However, as discussed below, the proper inquiry is 
when a reasonable person in Plaintiff's position would have known of his injuries, and Plaintiff's letter dated March 15, 2001 to 
OHRP indicates that he knew all of the facts of his injuries by March 15, 2001."
1299,8," The Court is not required to accept as true allegations of fact that are obviously untrue, or that obviously cannot be proven. See 
note 2, supra. Moreover, the Court may consider the factual allegations contained in the February 12, 2003 letter from OHRP 
without converting Defendants' motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion, because Plaintiff has described or identified 
this letter in the Third Amended Complaint and some or all of his claims are based on this document. Burlington, 114 F.3d at

1301,17," The parties appear to be in agreement that Plaintiff's common law tort claims are subject to Pennsylvania's two year statute of 
limitations. Where a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction, it is required to apply the substantive law of the forum state, 
which includes  [*20] statutes of limitations. Menichini v. Grant, 995 F.2d 1224, 1228 n. 2 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing Ciccarelli v. Carey 
Canadian M ines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548, 552 (3d Cir. 1985)). The applicable Pennsylvania statutes of limitations for claims arising 
out of tortious conduct are codified at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5524 (West Supp. 2005)."
1301,18," Equitable tolling, which presumes claim accrual, is invoked to toll or stop the running of the statute of limitations in light of 
established equitable considerations, Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1390 (3d Cir. 1994), such as "
1302,," where a defendant actively conceals or misleads the plaintiff from discovering the facts of his or her injury. If raised, equitable 
tolling will preclude the granting of a motion to dismiss because it raises questions of fact which cannot be determined on a 
motion to dismiss. Id. at 1391 n. 1. The Court of Appeals in Osihver cautioned against confusing equitable tolling with the 
discovery rule in applying statutes of limitations, opining: ""The purpose of the discovery rule is to determine the accrual date of a 
claim, for ultimate purposes of determining, as a legal matter, when the statute of limitations begins to run. Equitable tolling . . . 
presumes claim accrual."" Id. Plaintiff  [*22] has not advanced an equitable tolling argument in this case, nor has he pled any 
facts in support of equitable tolling, to stop the running of the statute of limitations. Rather, Plaintiff argues that the discovery rule 
applies to extend the date of accrual. Determining the date of accrual of a cause of action is a legal matter that can be 
determined in a motion to dismiss. Kingston Coal Co. v. Felton Min. Co., Inc., 456 Pa.Super. 270, 279, 690 A.2d 284, 289 (1997) 
(citing E.J.M . v. Archdiocese of Philadelphia, 424 Pa.Super. 449, 455, 622 A.2d 1388, 1391) (1993) (""where the facts are so 
clear that reasonable minds cannot differ as to whether the plaintiff should reasonably be aware that he has suffered an injury, 
the determination as to when the limitations period commences may be made as a matter of law."")). Therefore, the Court is not 
precluded from determining whether the statute of limitations bars Plaintiff's tort claims."
1302,19," The Court may consider factual allegations contained in the March 15, 2001 correspondence to the OHRP because Plaintiff 
identified this correspondence in his Third Amended Complaint, and his negligence and conversion claims are based on this 
letter as well as OHRP's letter dated February 12, 2003. Pension Benefit Guar., 998 F.2d at 1196. However, the Court declines 
to consider Plaintiff's  [*24] Affidavit (Doc. No. 70-12) proffered in support of his ""discovery"" of Defendants' conduct which he 
claims gave rise to the instant action, because for purposes of deciding a statute of limitations argument in a motion to dismiss, 
the Court may only look to the allegations in the complaint or documents identified in the complaint. Bethel v. Jendoco Constr. 
Corp.,570 F.2d 1168, 1174 (3d Cir. 1978) (if it is not apparent on the face of the complaint that the action is barred by a statute 
of limitations, than that defense may not provide the basis for dismissal of the claim under Rule 12(b)(6)). "
1303,20," A close reading of Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint reveals that he has pled a continuing violation only as to the criminal 
conduct that he alleges supports his claim for violation of Sections 1962 and 1964 of RICO. (TAC ¶104, subsections a, h, & i.) 
Arguably, even if Plaintiff's allegations of a continuing violation as to his RICO claim could be construed to extend to his state tort 
claims for conversion and civil conspiracy, which the Court declines to find, the facts alleged in the Third Amended Complaint do 
not establish a continuing conversion/theft of his PMI or a continuing conspiracy to steal/convert his PMI. To the contrary, the 
factual allegations in the Third Amended Complaint show that the sole basis for Plaintiff's claim for damages as to his conversion "
1304,," claim (TAC ¶¶ 89-92) and civil conspiracy claim (¶¶ 76-79) is a single act—the denial of his claim for WCOD, the facts of which 
were known at the latest  [*30] on March 15, 2001. Accordingly, the Court finds no basis for invoking the continuing violation 
doctrine to any of Plaintiff's state tort claims."
1304,21," The only reference to any ""studies"" in the WC-ALJ's decision appears as part of the background information provided 
regarding Dr. Albers credentials: The WC-ALJ noted that Dr. Albers participated in a study that was funded by NIOSH in the 
early 1980's involving the neurological effects of solvent exposures, and that he participated in subsequent investigations and 
studies involving the effects of solvent exposure on an individual's neurological well-being. (Id. at 8.) Nowhere in the WC-ALJ's 
decision does he find that his credibility determinations of Defendants were based on the JOEM articles or the underlying 
studies. Likewise, the WCAB and Commonwealth Court affirmances of the WC-ALJ's decision do not turn on any findings in the 
""studies"" or JOEM articles."
1304,22," Based on the testimony of Mr. Keller, the WC-ALJ found that although Plaintiff may have had some short periods of peak 
exposure to solvents in excess of the permissible levels, this  [*33] exposure was minimal and occurred in areas where a large 
volume of air was present thus allowing for evaporation and prevention of concentration, and therefore, could not be expected to 
cause an occupational disease. (Decision of WC-ALJ dated 12/7/00 at 11 (Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Answer to Defs.' Joint Mot. to Dismiss 
TAC (Doc. Nos. 70-3 and 73-3).) The WC-ALJ also accepted as credible the testimony of Kennedy and Cockroft as to Plaintiff's 
occupational exposure. (Id.) The WC-ALJ further found significant the fact that Dr. Albers' examination of Plaintiff yielded no 
neurological symptoms, complaints or neurological signs attributable to exposure to organic solvents, and that the neurological 
exam of Plaintiff was completely normal, while the majority of problems reported by Plaintiff had a psychological basis. (Id.) In 
this regard, Dr. Albers found significant Plaintiff's complaint that his depression was most severe at a time after his exposure to 
the occupational solvents terminated, because there is no evidence of a delayed symptom with exposure to solvents followed by 
delayed period of time of onset of a problem; rather, according to Dr. Albers, the studies showed improvement after removal 
 [*34] from exposure. (Id. at 9.) (Emphasis added.) In addition, during Dr. Albers' examination, Plaintiff complained of depression "
1305,," and anxiety of a duration of approximately seven to 10 years; however, Dr. Albers found Plaintiff's statements to be contradicted 
by his medical records which showed the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms to the mid-1970's or mid-1980's, as 
well as by Plaintiff's previous statements to physicians that he has been depressed his entire life. (Id. at 8.) The WC-ALJ also 
found credible Dr. Berent's opinion that although he found Plaintiff had a relatively severe emotional disturbance, he had a long 
history of psychiatric disturbance dating back many years. Moreover, Dr. Berent noted that Plaintiff's scores on several cognitive 
tests were so low that there should have been some demonstrable neurological impairment accompanying the poor performance 
which did not exist. (Id. at 9-10.) Also, Dr. Berent's examination revealed that Plaintiff's scores on tests that required memory 
were inconsistent. (Id. at 10.) Thus, the WC-ALJ found the opinion testimony of Dr. Berent, that although Plaintiff has a severe 
emotional disturbance, there is no evidence that toxins  [*35] played any role and that Plaintiff does not have a solvent-induced 
disorder, to be credible. (Id. at 11.)"
1305,23," The Court also takes judicial notice of the decision of Judge Shaffer in Butler County Court of Common Pleas in which he 
found Plaintiff was  [*37] collaterally estopped from proving causation in products liability action against the manufacturers of the 
chemical solvents which allegedly caused his TSE. See Vavro v. E+E(US) Inc., t/d/b/a Chemply, A.D. No. 99-10526, slip op. at 3 
(Butler Co. Ct. Com. Pl. Jan. 18, 2002) (Doc. No. 26-2). "
1306,24," Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's conversion/theft claim is collaterally estopped. However, both the WCAP and 
Commonwealth Court found they did not have jurisdiction over Plaintiff's conversion claim because he raised it for the first time 
on appeal. Nonetheless, the WCAB and Commonwealth Court proceeded to render an advisory opinion as to the merits of 
Plaintiff's conversion/theft claim. This is dicta as best and does not meet the first requirement for collateral estoppel. As the 
Supreme Court noted in Thomas v. Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 282, 100 S. Ct. 2647, 65 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1980), res judicata 
principles may only be applied where the court had jurisdiction to decide the issue in the first instance. Since the Pennsylvania 
workers' compensation tribunals found they did not have jurisdiction over Plaintiff's conversion/theft claim, the opinions of the 
WCAB and Commonwealth Court as to that claim are not entitled to collateral  [*40] estoppel effect. "
1309,25," The New York Supreme Court in Waldron also found that although patients have a right to access their records regarding 
medical treatment, it is well established under New York law that these records become property belonging to the treating 
doctors. 619 N.Y.S. 2d at 843 (citations omitted). "
1310,26," Both of the JOEM articles describe the subjects of the research studies: The June 1999 article indicates that the human 
research subjects consisted of ""thirty railroad workers previously diagnosed with toxic encephalopathy""; the 2000 JOEM article 
indicates that the subject of the research study consisted of ""52 railroad workers with long-term occupational solvent exposures . 
. . previously diagnosed . . . as having solvent-induced toxic encephalopathy."""
1310,27," The Court finds no merit in Plaintiff's argument that OHRP's February 12, 2003 letter conclusively determined Defendants 
unlawfully interfered with Plaintiff's possession and use of his PMI. Plaintiff seriously misstates the contents of this letter and it is 
disingenuous to represent to the Court that OHRP found anything other than the UM-IRB failed to document the criteria for 
waiver of the informed consent requirements. Plaintiff's conclusion is simply not warranted by the actual contents of the letter. "
1311,," Moreover, because the Court has found that Plaintiff's property interest in his PMI cannot be the subject of a conversion action in 
Pennsylvania, and that Defendants' used Plaintiff's PMI with consent  [*59] and lawful justification, the Court finds it is not 
necessary to address Defendants' remaining argument. "
1312,28," This is not a situation where Plaintiff's fraud claim should be dismissed without prejudice with leave to file yet another 
amended complaint. Plaintiff is not entitled to an  [*65] unlimited number of bites from the proverbial apple. See Rolo v. City 
Investing Co. Liquidating Trust, 155 F.3d 644, 659 (3d Cir. 1998) (citing Gasoline Sales, Inc. v. Aero Oil Co., 39 F.3d 70, 74 (3d 
Cir. 1994)). He has already had four opportunities to adequately plead his claim and has failed to cure the deficiencies. 
Moreover, the C ourt cannot envision any set of facts that would establish a prima facie claim of fraud. Therefore, allowing 
Plaintiff to file yet another amended complaint would be futile. Under these circumstances, the Court recommends Plaintiff's 
fraud claim be dismissed with prejudice. Gasoline Sales, 39 F.3d at 74. "
1313,29," Plaintiff contends that Defendants' unauthorized use of Plaintiff's PMI violates the criminal provisions of HIPAA. (Pl.'s 
Answering Br. at 13.)"
1313,30," Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts in support of his claim that Defendants' conduct has resulted in intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. Therefore, the Court does not construe the Third Amended Complaint as setting forth a cognizable 
 [*68] claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. "
1314,31," In Count VI of the Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiff appears to be alleging a violation of subsection (c) of Section 1962. 
(TAC ¶ 100.) Plaintiff's allegations of a RICO conspiracy under Section 1962(d) are set forth in Count V and are discussed infra 
in Part 4.b."
1314,32," With regard to their argument that Plaintiff is required to allege and prove an injury to his business or property, Defendants 
refer continuously to Section 1962(c). However, Court believes Defendants meant to cite to Section 1964(c)."
1314,33," Defendants advance an additional argument in support of their motion to dismiss. Defendants submit that RICO claims must 
be pleaded with specificity where the underlying acts involve allegations sounding in fraud and the Third Amended Complaint is 
woefully deficient in this regard. Because the Court finds Plaintiff's civil RICO claim deficient on other grounds, it need not 
address this argument. "
1315,34," See note 28, supra. "
1316,35," As to the first alleged injury, the Court of Appeals in Anderson concluded that although job loss is not speculative in that 
plaintiffs' claims were for lost wages, this was not the kind of injury that normally creates RICO standing because plaintiffs failed 
to allege sufficient facts to show that the alleged RICO violations proximately caused them to lose their jobs. 396 F.3d at 270-71. 
The court's conclusion in this regard turned on its proximate cause analysis which is discussed more fully infra at 268."
1316,36," Although the proximate cause analysis in AGC involved violations of antitrust law, the Supreme Court and U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit have noted that such analysis applies equally to civil RICO claims brought under § 1964(c). 
Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268; Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 932 (3d Cir. 1999) 
 [*82] (citing Holmes, supra, and McCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 855 (3d Cir. 1996)). "
1318,37," The Court of Appeals in Steamfitters identified five alleged links in the causal chain: ""(1) the tobacco companies engaged in a 
conspiracy to suppress information and withhold products from the market; (2) the Funds were prevented from informing their 
members about the dangers of smoking and the availability of less dangerous products; (3) smokers continued to smoke 
dangerous tobacco products that they would not have otherwise used (or would have used less); (4) smokers contracted more 
smoking-related illnesses; and, finally, (5) the Funds suffered increased expenses due to their reimbursement of smokers' health 
care costs."" 171 F.3d at 930."
1318,38," The Court of Appeals further noted the funds' claims raised concerns about apportioning damages which weighed against 
RICO standing, while the third prong of the proximate cause analysis—whether another party could better vindicate the RICO 
claims—was not fully applicable. However, the Court of Appeals held its finding as to the third factor did not outweigh its 
concerns regarding the remoteness of injury and apportionment of damages. 171 F.3d at 933-34. "
1319,39," In Beck, plaintiff was the president of an insurance company who discovered some of the company's officers and directors 
were engaged in a financial fraud and reported it to the insurance regulators. In response, the conspiring officers and directors 
hired a consultant to write a false report suggesting the president failed to adequately perform his duties, and the board of 
directors terminated the president based on the fabricated report. 529 U.S. 494, 498, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 146 L. Ed. 2d 561 (2000). 
The plaintiff in Beck, like the plaintiffs in Anderson, alleged only one overt act that directly harmed him—his termination. Despite 
the fact that the defendants in Beck controlled the board of directors that terminated the plaintiff-president, and their falsified 
report was directly relied upon by the board  [*93] of directors in terminating plaintiff, the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded 
that proximate cause was lacking because the alleged overt act—his termination—was not a direct act of racketeering under 
Section 1962(a) - (c), which is required for RICO standing. 529 U.S. at 507. Beck is also discussed in Part 4.b, infra, in 
conjunction with the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's RICO conspiracy claim. "
1320,40," Plaintiff alleges the following overt  [*95] acts by Defendants: (1) conducting fraudulent DMEs; (2) distorting the results of the 
DMEs; (3) conversion of and interference with Plaintiff's and TSE-Claimants' PMI which allegedly constitutes a violation of 
HIPAA; (4) publication of studies in JOEM which included Plaintiff's PMI; and (5) testifying at workers' co mpensation 
proceedings. None of these acts, however, directly harmed Plaintiff. Arguably, the only act that directly harmed Plaintiff was the 
denial of his claims for WCOD and disability retirement benefits. However, this harm was not directly caused by Defendants, but 
rather, caused by the WC-ALJ and appellate courts. Moreover, the denial of WCOD benefits is not a direct act of racketeering 
activity under Sections 1961 and 1962. Thus, Plaintiff cannot establish the direct causal connection required for proximate 
cause."

1329,3," MDMC contends that admissions made by FMG in a prior state action further supports this conclusion. While I agree with 
MDMC that a court may take judicial notice of admissions made in a prior action when ruling on a motion to dismiss, Harris v. 
N.Y. State Dep't of Health, 202 F. Supp. 2d 143, 173 n.13 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), I need not rely on FMG's admissions in the other 
case to decide this case. "

1334,1," The Mileage Rule provides: New competitions offering ""A"" rated hunter or jumper divisions or sections will not be recognized on dates conflicting with 
those of any other Recognized Competition within the applicable distance specified by this rule which offers A rated hunter 
or jumper divisions or sections, regardless of class scheduling. . . . The mileage restrictions . . . will not prevent two 
Hunter/Jumper competitions from being approved if the two competitions have different competition managements and the 
competition with priority gives written permission, to be renewed annually, and the mileage distance between competitions 
is at least 10 miles. "
1348,1," We provisionally allowed the parties to file their briefs and the record under seal. To the extent this opinion cites to sealed 
portions of the briefs and record, those portions are unsealed. As to all remaining portions of the briefs and records, we GRANT 
the parties' motions to seal."
1348,2," Although service centers can purchase aluminum from sources other than North American mills (such as brokers, mill depots, 
other service centers, or foreign mills), those options are frequently less desirable because of price and quality concerns."
1348,3," Rebates are generally given in response to a situation where more than one mill is competing to sell product to the distributor. 
Because Commonwealth was often the only mill selling to Champagne, Champagne was not offered these ""competitive 
situation"" rebates. "
1350,4," The district court also found that Dr. Murry failed to base his opinions on appropriate facts. Specifically, the district court noted 
that many of Dr. Murry's opinions were based solely on facts provided by Champagne and ruled that ""[n]o reasonable economist 
would simply accept the self-serving statement of an interested party as fact."" It is unclear whether this was intended as an 
alternative basis for exclusion. In any event, we will address this ground, as it demonstrates an additional defect in Dr. Murry's 
testimony. Champagne argues that the district court ""fundamental[ly] misunderst[ood] . . . Dr. Murry's role in this case in particular, and the 
role an economist plays in an antitrust action."" Champagne proposes that Dr. Murry's report and testimony ""were not intended to 
confirm factual evidence of Defendants' threats to the mills or the knowledge of these threats within the industry,"" but rather ""Dr. 
Murry's role in this litigation was to offer the opinion that, assuming such facts are established, an economist would confirm that 
such threats, and knowledge of them within the industry, would create a barrier to entry in the market."" Champagne is certainly correct in stating that, generally, an economist's role in an antitrust case is not to prove facts, but to 
opine on economic theory. See, e.g., Gregory J. Werden, Economic Evidence on the Existence of Collusion: Reconciling 
Antitrust Law with Oligopoly Theory, 71 Antitrust L.J. 719, 789 (2004) (""The role of the expert economist in antitrust cases is to 
apply microeconomic theory to the messy facts of a case.""). However, Champagne fails to identify, nor could we find, any point 
in Dr. Murry's report or deposition that made clear that he was only assuming the facts he asserted. See generally United States "
1351,," v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 108 F.3d 1228, 1238 n.8 (10th Cir. 1997) (noting that the appellant bears the responsibility of connecting 
his arguments to specific citations in the record). Further, in reviewing Dr. Murry's report, it is not clear to us (nor, do we think, would it be clear to a jury) that this is what Dr. 
Murry intended to do. For example, Dr. Murry's report states that ""Champagne . . . experienced difficulty acquiring sales persons 
because prospective employees feared Champagne would be unable to acquire the supplies of critical aluminum products from 
the mills at competitive prices."" This sounds like a confirmation (rather than an assumption) of the fact that Champagne had 
trouble hiring; the district court noted, and Champagne does not refute, that Dr. Murry based this conclusion only on evidence 
provided by Champagne and ""had not spoken with a single potential sales person who declined an offer."" The relevance of the 
district court's concern becomes clear when considering why the ""fact"" that Champagne had trouble hiring was important. Dr. 
Murry's report goes on to state that ""difficulty in assembling a qualified, experienced sales force is a business risk and a 
deterrent to investment and entry into the service center business. Significantly, these deterrents to entering the service center 
business are injurious to competition among service centers."" In other words, Dr. Murry opined that there was a barrier to entry 
because of the inability to hire. Champagne claims that the report intended only to ""offer the opinion that, assuming [certain] 
facts were established,"" there was a barrier to entry. However, the report nowhere makes clear that Dr. Murry is merely 
""assuming"" that Champagne had trouble hiring. Rather, the report conclusively states that Champagne ""experienced difficulty 
acquiring sales persons."" HN6[
] The district court, in performing its gatekeeper function, considers ""whether the evidence or testimony will assist the 
trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue."" Gabaldon, 389 F.3d at 1098 (alterations, quotations 
omitted). Expert testimony that fails to make clear that certain facts the expert describes as true are merely assumed for the 
purpose of an economic analysis may not assist the trier of fact at all and, instead, may simply result in confusion. Thus it was 
not ""manifestly unreasonable"" for the district court to conclude that Dr. Murry's opinions lacked foundation because they were 
based on ""the self-serving statement[s] of an interested party."""
1351,5," This error may stem from the fact that Champagne did not name the mills as defendants in the alleged conspiracy. However, 
Champagne did argue below that the mills were co-conspirators for evidentiary purposes. HN9[
] The co-conspirator hearsay 
exception contains no requirement that the declarant be a defendant, only that she be a member of the conspiracy. Cf. United 
States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 701, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974) (""Declarations by one defendant may also be 
admissible against other defendants upon a sufficient showing . . . of a conspiracy among one or more other defendants and the "
1352,," declarant and if the declarations at issue were in furtherance of that conspiracy. The same is true of declarations of 
coconspirators who are not defendants in the case on trial."") (emphasis added); United States v. Williams, 989 F.2d 1061, 1067 
(9th Cir. 1993) (""An individual need not be indicted to be considered a coconspirator for the purposes of rule 801(d)(2)(E)."")."
1352,6," Champagne also complains that the district court failed to consider its evidence cumulatively. As we are remanding for the 
district court to make a preliminary factual determination of whether a conspiracy including the mills existed, we need not reach 
this issue. However, we emphasize the Supreme Court's admonition in Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 
97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987), that individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it. The sum of an 
evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts. . . . [A] piece of evidence, unreliable in isolation, may 
become quite probative when corroborated by other evidence. Id. at 179-80. Thus, as it did with the statements of the Established Distributors, the district court should consider the mill 
representatives' statements and other evidence together in determining whether, for purposes of the co-conspirator hearsay 
exception, the evidence makes the existence of a conspiracy more likely than not."
1352,7," Champagne also argues that the district court should have been ""even more cautious"" in drawing inferences against 
Champagne from the record because the court limited the amount of depositions Champagne could take in the case. 
Champagne cites no authority for its claim that the discovery limitation has an effect on the review of the evidence, and thus we 
need not even consider the argument. See Eateries, Inc. v. J.R. Simplot Co., 346 F.3d 1225, 1232 (10th Cir. 2003) (""A party 
forfeits an issue it does not support with legal authority or argument."") (quotations omitted). "
1353,," In any event, HN12[
] we review rulings relating to discovery for abuse of discretion. See The Procter & Gamble Co. v. Haugen, 427 F.3d 727, 742-43 (10th Cir. 2005). At the start of discovery, Champagne was allowed twenty-five depositions, 
which was the number it initially requested. The district court subsequently entertained a motion by Champagne to re-open 
discovery and conduct nine additional depositions. It granted the request for eight of the nine and only denied the request to 
depose Ken-Mac's Larry Parsons; it did so because Champagne had not offered any justification for waiting ""until the twilight of 
discovery"" to request the deposition. See Smith v. United States, 834 F.2d 166, 169 (10th Cir. 1987) (noting that ""whether the 
moving party was diligent in obtaining discovery"" is a factor in considering whether to re-open discovery). Champagne points to 
no other instances in which it requested additional depositions. Under these circumstances, we do not think that the district court 
abused its discretion in ""limiting"" discovery."
1353,8," Champagne also pointed to statements by Larry Parsons, president of Ken-Mac Metals, and Debbie Veal, a buyer for 
Jorgensen. During a negotiation for the purchase of Champagne by Ken-Mac, Michael Champagne testified that he and Parsons were talking about Champagne Metals' inability to purchase aluminum from the mills. We discussed the fact that 
[Jorgensen] and some of the other service centers had gotten together and the resulting problems my company had 
experienced being recognized by Commonwealth. Mr. Parsons made the comment that he would have gotten it done, 
meaning kept Commonwealth from selling to Champagne Metals. . . . Mr. Parsons further stated that Champagne Metals 
was the biggest mistake in his career, and that if he would have known about Champagne Metals, it would have been 
stopped. Mr. Parsons implied that the other service centers had messed up, but he could get everyone together to make it 
happen. Further, Bill Thomas, a sales representative for Commonwealth, stated that Veal said she wished Commonwealth would not 
recognize Champagne, and that she had been in touch with her counterparts, who were part of the National Association of Aluminum Distributors group . . ., 
and that they were not at all happy about it, and they had more clout and [Commonwealth] probably would listen--would be-
-would have to listen to them. As to the Parsons' statement, we first note that the district court excluded the portion of Champagne's affidavit referring to 
Jorgensen and other service centers getting together as inconsistent with Champagne's deposition testimony, and it is not clear 
that Champagne appeals that decision. In any event, the statement at best showed that Parsons ""implied"" that there would be 
collective action. Direct evidence ""is explicit and requires no inferences"" to establish concerted action, thus this implication of 
collective action cannot suffice. See Jacob Blinder & Sons, Inc. v. Gerber Prods. Co. (In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig.), 166 F.3d 
112, 118 (3d Cir. 1999). Similarly, Veal's statement, while perhaps an admission that the service centers individually would 
attempt to force Commonwealth to stop dealing with Champagne, contains no suggestion of any agreement between the service 
centers. Thus we agree with the district court that these statements ""lack[] the requisite 'clarity' to constitute direct evidence."""
1353,9," Although it is possible to construct ambiguity in almost any statement, the Established Distributors do not offer us any other 
discrete interpretation of this statement that would move it into the category of circumstantial evidence. "
1354,10," Indeed, the district court's example of group boycott mechanics, which it cites to show that there was not direct evidence of a 
conspiracy here, actually demonstrates that Wiley's statement was direct evidence. The district court, citing the Handbook of the 
Law of Antitrust, explained that in a group boycott [t]he boycotting members, in effect, say to their suppliers . . ., ""If you don't stop dealing with the non-group members, we will 
stop dealing with you."" If continued trade with group members is more important to a supplier . . . than is trading with non-
group members, this threat will be effective. "
1355,11," The district court actually found that Champagne's theory made no economic sense at all and that it ""would have no qualms 
granting summary judgment"" on this ground alone. However, the court was willing, ""for the purpose of testing [Champagne's] 
economic evidence, to assume that the theory makes 'some' sense."""
1355,12," To the extent that this is a suggestion that a group boycott cannot be a violation of the antitrust laws without a concomitant 
price-fixing or market allocation agreement, the district court is incorrect. Exclusionary group boycotts and collusive agreements 
to set price or market share are two different theories of antitrust liability. See, e.g., Kenneth L. Glazer, Concerted Refusals To 
Deal Under Section 1 Of The Sherman Act, 70 Antitrust L.J. 1, 4-5 (2002) (""'[C]ollusive' agreements are agreements aimed 
directly at improving the terms (price or non-price) on which suppliers deal with their customers . . . [W]hen firms act in a 
'collusive' manner, they aim to replicate the pricing and other conduct of a single-firm monopolist by exercising joint monopoly 
power. . . . Exclusionary conduct, on the other hand, is conduct ultimately designed to achieve that same goal, but it aims to do 
so by excluding competitors from the market.""). "
1356,13," The Established Distributors argue that, because Champagne alleges the boycott began as soon as it entered the market, 
there was no point at which it could have developed a reputation as an aggressive, price-cutting competitor. However, 
Champagne's founder had a long-standing relationship with many customers due to his previous employment by one of the 
Established Distributors. Moreover, the Established Distributors' own statements demonstrate that they viewed Champagne as 
such a competitor."
1356,14," The Established Distributors make much of the fact that Champagne's own economic expert seems to have admitted that a 
boycott would be economically irrational without a corollary price-fixing agreement. In the expert's deposition, the following 
exchange occurred: Q. If you assumed hypothetically that some of the defendants got together and kept some mills from supplying some 
service centers, say Mike Champagne and two of his friends, and maybe stopped some entry hypothetically, given these 
markets with hundreds of service centers . . . [and the] competitive pricing in both purchasing and selling, absent collusion 
on price, they're never going to achieve any sustained benefit from such actions, correct? A. If you apply a, which I think you are, a strict theoretical microeconomic interpretation of competition in relationships to 
market, then that's - that would be a correct conclusion. We first note that the district court excluded Champagne's expert's report and testimony--a ruling which we affirmed. Given this, 
the value of any argument based on this deposition testimony is little to none. Moreover, we refuse to be bound by such a ""strict 
theoretical microeconomic interpretation"" of competition. ""[N]o real-world market is ever perfectly competitive."" Alan J. Daskin & 
Lawrence Wu, Observations on the Multiple Dimensions of Market Power, 19 Antitrust 53, 54 (Summer 2005). Moreover, the 
Established Distributors' own statements indicate that they thought there were profits to be protected by the exclusion of "
1357,," Champagne. HN18[
] While we acknowledge that antitrust law is strongly premised on economic theory, common sense still has a role. "
1358,15," The Established Distributors also argue that Champagne's own evidence shows it was not injured from any overt act occurring 
within the limitations period, and thus recovery under the continuing conspiracy exception is inappropriate. See Kaw Valley, 872 
F.2d at 933 (noting that new act ""must inflict new and accumulating injury on the plaintiff"") (quotation omitted). However, 
Champagne's damages expert based his damages calculations on, inter alia, the higher price paid by Champagne for aluminum 
because of its inability to buy from all significant domestic mills, Champagne's lack of access to Ormet's products, and the loss 
of pricing advantage because of Champagne's lack of multiple domestic mills. These injuries stemmed from the denial of 
recognition of Champagne by the mills--denials that Champagne alleges were prompted by the pressure put on the mills by the 
Established Distributors. Further, at least some of these denials occurred within the limitations period; for example, Ormet 
refused to recognize Champagne in 2002. Thus the Established Distributors are incorrect to say that Champagne's evidence 
shows it suffered no injury from acts within the limitations period. "
1359,16," In its brief to this court, Champagne only expressly points to one such act occurring within the limitations period--the alleged 
threats and pressure exerted on Ormet in early 2002, when Ormet ""appeared to have nearly approved Champagne."" On 
remand, the district court should determine in the first instance whether there are other overt acts for which Champagne seeks to 
recover--i.e., acts occurring during the limitations period."
1359,17," As an additional alternative ground for affirmance, the Established Distributors assert that Champagne's claim should be 
analyzed under the rule of reason (rather than as a per se claim) and that, under this approach, Champagne has failed to satisfy 
its burden of showing that the alleged conspiracy had any adverse effect on competition. See I ABA Section of Antitrust Law, 
Antitrust Law Developments 53 (4th ed. 1997) (""[U]nder the 'traditional' rule of reason, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of 
proving that an agreement has had or is likely to have a substantially adverse effect on competition.""). The district court did not 
rule on this argument, and we find the appellate record insufficient to allow us to address this issue in the first instance. See 
generally Diaz v. Farley, 215 F.3d 1175, 1182-83 (10th Cir. 2000) (explaining that the determination of whether a group boycott 
claim is to be judged under a per se or rule of reason standard requires examination of whether defendants ""possess market 
power or exclusive access to an essential element to effective competition"" and whether there were ""plausible arguments that 
[the challenged practices] were intended to enhance overall efficiency and make markets more competitive"") (quotations 
omitted). We therefore decline to affirm the district court on this basis. See Maldonado, 433 F.3d at 1302-03 (""[W]e have 
discretion to affirm on any ground adequately supported by the record."") (emphasis added). This issue may be explored further 
on remand."
1359,18, Section 203(A) provides that 
1360,," [e]very HN23[
] act, agreement, contract, or combination in the form of a trust, or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of 
trade or commerce within this state is hereby declared to be against public policy and illegal."
1360,79, Okla. Stat. Ann. 203(A).
1360,19," As noted earlier, we do not decide this issue today."
1360,20," The federal cases to which Champagne cites are inapposite--as the district court correctly noted, Section 1 of the Sherman 
Act simply does not reach unilateral conduct in restraint of trade. "
1361,21," As noted, the evidence of the barrier to entry/injury to competition in Harolds Stores was the testimony of the plaintiff's 
economic expert. 82 F.3d at 1549. Champagne's economic expert did state that the threats by the Established Distributors ""[are] 
a deterrent to any other investors contemplating entry into the service center business in the relevant market."" However, the 
district court excluded this evidence and we affirmed, thus the testimony is not part of the record. We do not mean to imply that 
there might not be other evidence of injury to competition to be found in this case's voluminous record; we note only that 
Champagne fails to point to any such evidence on appeal. "
1362,22," On appeal, the Established Distributors argue that Champagne's tortious interference claims are barred by the two-year 
statute of limitations because Champagne knew of the Established Distributors' conduct in 1996--six years prior to its bringing 
suit. The district court explained that recovery was permissible for each tortious act occurring inside of the limitations period--that 
is, after April 22, 2000. The Established Distributors provide no support for their claim that Champagne was required to bring its 
claim within two years of the first act or lose the ability to sue for any subsequent act, thus we will not consider the argument. 
See Eateries, Inc., 346 F.3d at 1232 (""A party forfeits an issue it does not support with legal authority or argument."") (quotations 
omitted)."
1362,23," Champagne does not challenge this ruling on appeal. Further, the district court ruled that, as none of the alleged acts within 
the limitations period involved defendant Earle M. Jorgensen Co., summary judgment in Jorgensen's favor was appropriate. 
Champagne does not challenge this ruling on appeal; we therefore affirm summary judgment for Jorgensen on the tortious 
interference claim."
1362,24," HN29[
] Interference with prospective economic advantage requires a party to show (1) the existence of a valid business 
relation or expectancy, (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy by the defendant(s), (3) intentional interference inducing 
or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy, and (4) resultant damage. Boyle Servs., Inc. v. Dewberry 
Design Group, Inc., 2001 OK CIV APP 63, 24 P.3d 878, 880 (Okla. Civ. App. 2001)."
1362,25," Champagne argues that the two claims are interrelated because interference with an existing business relationship might 
cause damage in the form of the loss of a prospective economic advantage. Be this as it may, the district court's ruling had 
nothing to do with damages; rather, the court focused on the fact that Champagne had shown no existing relationship with 
Ormet. "
1363,26," Champagne argues that, by stating that only conduct that amounted to an unreasonable restraint of trade could support a 
showing of tortious interference, the district court imposed an ""excessively narrow reading"" of what acts could be lawful within 
the meaning of a tortious interference claim. However, any narrowing of what acts might qualify as ""wrongful"" was done by 
Champagne, not the district court--in its motion for summary judgment, Champagne specifically argued that ""the [Established 
Distributors'] illegal acts in restraint of trade . . . are wrongful and, thus, sufficiently malicious to support Plaintiff's claims for 
tortious interference."" The district court did not err by restricting its analysis to the theory advanced by Champagne."
1363,27, We leave any further consideration of the award of costs to the district court on remand. 
1369,1," The First Amended Complaint provides information on NicSand's 1999 sales to Autozone, 1997 sales to Advance Auto and 
CSK, and 1996 sales to Kmart. Together, these sales totaled approximately $3.4 million. We assume that NicSand sold 
$600,000 of abrasives through other channels."
1369,2," NicSand does not allege that the wrap-around program itself constituted unlawful anticompetitive conduct. (3M wrongly reads 
NicSand's brief to suggest that it does. See Appellee's Br. 22-23.) Rather, NicSand makes clear in its reply brief that its 
allegations concerned only 3M's exclusive dealing contracts with the other five large retailers, and that the wrap-around program 
with Wal-Mart simply provided a context for the alleged illegality. Reply Br. 11-12. "
1371,3," But see United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (""[I]n considering whether 
the monopolist's conduct on balance harms competition and is therefore condemned as exclusionary for purposes of § 2, our 
focus is upon the effect of that conduct, not upon the intent behind it. Evidence of the intent behind the conduct of a monopolist 
is relevant only to the extent it helps us understand the likely effect of the monopolist's conduct."")."
1371,4," In this latter formulation, exclusive dealing contracts are referred to as ""requirements contracts."" "
1372,5," Exclusive dealing claims thus differ from exclusive distribution claims, which allege that a party has unlawfully committed to 
distribute its product through only one or more ""authorized"" distributors, often in a particular geographic area. See Care Heating 
& Cooling, Inc., 427 F.3d at 1008 (challenge by an ""unauthorized"" seller/servicer against an equipment manufacturer and one of 
its ""authorized"" sellers/servicers); CTUnify, Inc. v. Nortel Networks, Inc., 115 Fed. Appx. 831 (6th Cir. 2004) (challenge by phone 
training company against telecom equipment manufacturer and rival training company whose services manufacturer bundled 
with its products); see also Paddock Publ'ns. v. Chicago Tribune Co., 103 F.3d 42, 46-47 (7th Cir. 1996) (contrasting exclusive 
dealing and exclusive distribution)."
1372,6," It is on this basis that (in the Sherman Act § 1 context) exclusive dealing arrangements are not per se unlawful but are handled 
under the Rule of Reason--according to which courts examine whether a challenged practice has harmed competition. Antitrust 
Law 2002 P 1820b. Indeed, in that inquiry, courts have articulated several reasons why exclusive dealing contracts might 
promote competition: In the case of the buyer, [exclusive dealing contracts] may assure supply, afford protection against rises in price, enable 
long-term planning on the basis of known costs, and obviate the expense and risk of storage in the quantity necessary for a 
commodity having a fluctuating demand. From the seller's point of view, [exclusive dealing] contracts may make possible 
the substantial reduction of selling expenses, give protection against price fluctuations, and -- of particular advantage to a 
newcomer to the field to whom it is important to know what capital expenditures are justified -- offer the possibility of a 
predictable market. They may be useful, moreover, to a seller trying to establish a foothold against the counterattacks of 
entrenched competitors. Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 306-07, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949) (citations omitted); 
accord Menasha Corp. v. News Am. Mktg. In-Store, Inc., 354 F.3d 661, 663 (7th Cir. 2004) (""[C]ompetition for the contract is a 
vital form of rivalry, . . . which the antitrust laws encourage rather than suppress.""). "
1373,7," The Areeda/Hovenkamp treatise articulates the prima facie case for exclusive dealing claims as follows: To succeed in its claim of unlawful exclusive dealing a plaintiff must [1] show the requisite agreement to deal exclusively 
and [2] make a sufficient showing of power to warrant the inference that the challenged agreement threatens reduced 
output and higher prices in a properly defined market. . . . [3] Then it must also show foreclosure coverage sufficient to 
warrant an inference of injury to competition . . ., depending on the existence of other factors that give significance to a 
given foreclosure percentage, such as contract duration, presence or absence of high entry barriers, or the existence of 
alternative sources of distribution or resale. Antitrust Law 2002 P 1821; See also Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 58-59 (articulating the prima facie case liability under § 2). "
1374,8," It is notable that the magnitude of the discounts (measured as a percentage of NicSand's sales) declined as 3M locked up a 
progressively larger share of the distribution market. That is, as 3M seemed more likely to attain a monopoly position, the 
downstream distributors demanded progressively smaller discounts--perhaps because they expected NicSand to exit the market 
and hoped to assure themselves of some discount (and not be the only one of the distributors not to have done so) before none 
was available. Discovery would shed light on whether this apparent decline in discounts did in fact indicate the presence of such 
a collective action problem."
1374,9," Finding other grounds for dismissal, the district court did not address the sufficiency of NicSand's market allegations. "
1375,10," It held later, in Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., that antitrust injury is also required of plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief 
under § 16 of the Clayton Act. 479 U.S. 104, 113, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986). "
1378,11," The court in Hodges drew from the earlier case of Axis, S.p.A. v. Micafil, Inc., 870 F.2d 1105 (6th Cir. 1989), which denied 
standing to a firm challenging a merger of one of its rivals with a downstream patent holder. The plaintiff complained that the 
transaction harmed competition because the merged entity was likely to limit the plaintiff's access to the downstream firm's 
patents. Because the downstream firm might have lawfully limited the plaintiff's access even absent the merger, the court held 
that the merger did not cause the plaintiff antitrust injury."
1378,12," The court dismissed the defendants' contention that Andrx would have delayed its entry in the absence of the alleged antitrust 
violation in order to avoid damages in a pending patent infringement suit (by the other defendant). That possibility ""merely 
raise[d] a disputed issue of fact that [could not] be resolved on a motion to dismiss."" Id. at 900. It did not undermine the plaintiffs' 
standing because the complaint did not establish that Andrx was certain to delay entry on account of the pending litigation. In 
fact, as the court noted, some plaintiffs alleged that the patent infringement suit was a sham. Id. at 914. Far from it being "
1379,," ""apparent"" from the complaint that the same injury would have occurred in the absence of the antitrust violation, the complaint 
included affirmative allegations that Andrx would have entered the market (and thereby prevented the alleged injury) were it not 
for the alleged antitrust violation. "
1392,1," Although three separate Motions were filed, the Court will address them collectively, except where otherwise noted. Plaintiffs 
did not assert all claims against all Defendants, and any action taken herein should be construed to apply only as to those 
Defendants who actually challenged the claim at issue and asserted against them. "
1394,2," At the time of filing of this lawsuit and the instant motions, the appellate process was still underway. Plaintiffs have since filed a 
Motion to File Second Amended Complaint (docket number 79) in order to address the outcome of these proceedings. Plaintiffs 
also request leave to file a supplemental reply to the instant Motions to Dismiss (docket number 80), which request is MOOT 
upon entry of this Order. Plaintiffs' Motion to File Second Amended Complaint, however, is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs are hereby 
given leave to add the new information proposed in their Motion, and to address the concerns raised herein. "
1395,3," The corresponding state law claim alleged in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint as Count IV falls under 79 Okla. Stat. § 203(A), 
which states, ""Every act, agreement, contract, or combination in the form of a trust, or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of 
trade or commerce within this state is hereby declared to be against public policy and illegal."" "
1396,4," The corresponding state law claim alleged in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint as Count IV falls under 79 Okla. Stat. § 203(B), 
which states, ""It is unlawful for any person to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or 
commerce in a relevant market within this state."" "
1397,5," All jurisdictions do not appear to require both elements. For example, the Eleventh Circuit defines monopoly power as ""the 
power to raise prices to supra-competitive levels or . . . the power to exclude competition . . . by either restricting entry of new 
competitors or by driving existing competitors out of the market."" Levine, 72 F.3d at 1555 (citing U.S. Anchor Mfg., 7 F.3d at 994) 
(emphasis added). "
1398,6," Although Plaintiffs argue that the determination of per se analysis versus the rule of reason is not properly made on a motion to 
dismiss, Plaintiffs cite no authority for their position. Further, the Court does not recognize Plaintiffs' Count III as a separate 
claim, but rather as an alternative approach to their claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In this case, 
because of the confidential nature of the peer review process and the subsequent deference with which the courts approach 
issues of health and safety, the Court finds that Plaintiffs could plead no set of facts that would warrant per se treatment in this 
case. Thus, although Plaintiffs are not foreclosed from arguing, inter alia, the existence of an illegal boycott in support of their 
claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, such argument must be accompanied by some showing of anticompetitive effect, 
pursuant to the rule of reason analysis the Court must perform. "
1399,7," Plaintiffs filed suit on July 7, 2005, and any actionable defamation claims must have arisen within one year prior to that date. 
Claims not surviving the statute of limitations include, but are not limited to, those stated in the Amended Complaint at 
paragraphs 83(a)-(k), 85(a)-(q), 90, 99-101, 105-107, 116(a)-(h), 117(a)-(l), 120, 127-129, and 131. These claims are 
DISMISSED with prejudice. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs have not dated many of their defamation claims, including, but not limited to, those stated in 
the Amended Complaint at paragraphs 91(a)-(c), 98, 134, and 157. Because these claims do not afford Defendants here 
sufficient notice to raise the statute of limitations defense that they have successfully raised elsewhere, such claims are 
DISMISSED without prejudice. See Ellison v. Sobeck-Lynch, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20215 at *5 (W.D. N.Y. 1997) (dismissing 
defamation claims which did not allege ""when the communications were made, whether they were written or oral, the substance 
of the communications or to whom they were directed"")."
1399,8," The Court does note, however, that Plaintiffs' defamation claim consists of four paragraphs stating the claim and one paragraph 
incorporating the previous 192 paragraphs by reference, thereby necessitating no small amount of speculation as to which 
statements Plaintiffs allege to be defamatory. "
1400,9," Under Oklahoma law, participants in the peer review process are granted immunity from liability in such circumstances. See 76 
Okla. Stat. §§ 25-28. However, the protection against liability is not available in antitrust or civil rights claims. Id. § 27. The 
question therefore arises whether the antitrust exception might logically extend to the applicability of the privilege against 
disclosure. See infra Section VI. "
1403,10," It is unclear what the interplay between 63 Okla. Stat. § 1-1709.1 and 76 Okla. Stat. § 24 et seq. might be, if any, as there is 
remarkably little case law on either statute. Defendants point out that ""where a state holds out the expectation of protection to its 
citizens, they should not be disappointed by a mechanical and unnecessary application of the federal rule."" Shadur, 664 F.2d at 
1061. However, Oklahoma law holds out not only the expectation of near-absolute confidentiality in the peer review process (63 
Okla. Stat. § 1-1709.1), but also the expectation that such protection will not apply in antitrust cases (76 Okla. Stat. § 27) or in 
case of bad faith (76 Okla. Stat. § 26). "
1410,1," A similar description of the relevant statutes and regulations is set forth in the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Valley Drug Co. v. 
Geneva Pharms., Inc., 344 F.3d 1294, 1296-98 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 939, 125 S. Ct. 308, 160 L. Ed. 2d 248 
(2004), and the District of Columbia Circuit's opinion in Andrx Pharms., Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 178, 256 
F.3d 799, 801-02 (D.C. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 931, 122 S. Ct. 1305, 152 L. Ed. 2d 216 (2002)."
1410,2," The ANDA process was intended to be available to manufacturers of generic versions of approved drugs. ""A generic version . . 
. contains the same active ingredients, but not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as the pioneer drug. A generic drug, as 
the name implies, is ordinarily sold without a brand name and at a lower price."" Andrx Pharms., 256 F.3d at 801 n.1. Filing an 
ANDA allows a generic drug manufacturer to avoid the costly and time-consuming process of demonstrating safety and efficacy, 
allowing the manufacturer to rely on the FDA's earlier findings concerning the brand-name drug's NDA, and thereby facilitates 
quicker market entry by generic manufacturers. See id. at 801."
1410,3,"  HN2[
] The applicant shall file with the application the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims 
the drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims a method of using such drug and with respect to 
which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the 
manufacture, use, or sale of the drug."
1410,21, U.S.C. § 355(b)(1). 
1411,4," At the time of the settlement in this case, the statute did not specify that a district court decision would end the 30-month stay, 
and the FDA interpreted the statute to require a court decision ""from which no appeal can be or has been taken."" Ctr. for Drug 
Evaluation & Research (CDER), Food & Drug Admin., U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., Guidance for Industry: Court

include any district court decision. See id. at 3-5."
1411,5," Like its interpretation of the type of court decision sufficient to end the 30-month stay of final FDA approval described above, at 
the time of the settlement in this case and until 2000, the FDA interpreted a court decision required to trigger the 180-day period 
to mean only a court decision ""from which no appeal can be or has been taken."" See CDER, Court Decisions, supra, at 2 
(quoting 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(e)(1) (1999)). That interpretation was subsequently changed in 2000, when the FDA concluded 
that a patent invalidity decision by a district court would be sufficient to trigger the commencement of the 180-day period. See id. 
at 3-5. "
1412,6," In 2001, Zeneca's domestic sales of tamoxifen amounted to $ 442 million."
1412,7," Soon thereafter, Heumann was dismissed as a defendant after it agreed to be bound by a determination in that case as to the 
validity of the tamoxifen patent. Compl. P40. "
1413,8," The rule in U.S. Bancorp does not apply retroactively. See U.S. Philips Corp. v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 55 F.3d 592, 598 (Fed. 
Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1010, 116 S. Ct. 567, 133 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1995)."
1413,9," After the Settlement Agreement was entered into and the vacatur ordered, Barr began to market its licensed version of 
Zeneca's tamoxifen, selling its product to distributors and wholesalers at a 15 percent discount to the brand-name price, which 
translated into a price to consumers about five percent below Zeneca's otherwise identical Nolvadex(R) brand-name version. 
Barr soon captured about 80 percent of the tamoxifen market."
1413,10," Pharmachemie initially filed a paragraph III certification in August 1994, but later amended it to include a paragraph IV 
certification. See Tamoxifen II, 277 F. Supp. 2d at 126. "
1414,11," Mylan had agreed to follow the Pharmachemie court decision. See Tamoxifen II, 277 F. Supp. 2d at 127; AstraZemeca UK 
Ltd., No. 00-2239, slip op. at 2-3. "
1416,12," The Christianson Court employed the ""well-pleaded complaint"" test that is routinely applied to determine whether a federal 
district court has federal-question jurisdiction. See Christianson, 486 U.S. at 808 (quoting Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers 
Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983)); see also, e.g., Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 
U.S. 200, 124 S. Ct. 2488, 2494, 159 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2004); Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 396 F.3d 136, 140 
(2d Cir. 2005); Bracey v. Bd. of Educ., 368 F.3d 108, 113 (2d Cir. 2004). "
1418,13," ""Although the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits every agreement 'in restraint of trade,' th[e Supreme] Court has long 
recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints."" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 10, 118 S. Ct. 
275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997). Conduct may be deemed an unreasonable restraint of trade in two ways. Conduct may be 
considered per se unreasonable because it has ""such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect, and such limited 
potential for procompetitive benefit."" Id. In most cases, however, conduct will be evaluated under a ""rule of reason"" analysis, ""according to which the finder of fact must 
decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of 
factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and 
the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" Id. (citation omitted). The rule-of-reason analysis has been divided into three steps. First, a plaintiff must demonstrate ""that the challenged action has 
had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market."" Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk Valley 
Med. Assocs., 996 F.2d 537, 543 (2d Cir.) (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 947, 114 S. Ct. 388, 126 L. Ed. 2d 337 
(1993). If the plaintiff succeeds in doing so, ""the burden shifts to the defendant to establish the 'pro-competitive ""redeeming 
virtues""' of the action."" K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting Capital 
Imaging Assocs., 996 F.2d at 543). If the defendant succeeds in meeting its burden, the plaintiff then has the burden of 
""show[ing] that the same pro-competitive effect could be achieved through an alternative means that is less restrictive of 
competition."" Id."
1418,14," HN10[
] ""The offense of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-
71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). "
1419,15," It is true that had the defendants not settled the underlying patent litigation and had the district court's judgment been affirmed 
on appeal, Zeneca would have been estopped from asserting the validity of its patent against others seeking to enter the market. 
See Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found., 402 U.S. 313, 350, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971). However, it is 
clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be forced to relitigate the same issues 
involved in the settled case. Furthermore, before 1994, when district court judgments were vacated as a matter of course upon "
1420,," settlement, see U.S. Bancorp, 513 U.S. at 29 (virtually ending this practice), there was similarly and permissibly no collateral 
estoppel effect accorded these judgments for the benefit of future hypothetical plaintiffs. See Nestle, 756 F.2d at 284 
(""Drumbeating about the need to protect other unknown users of the trademark [in question] will ring hollow indeed in the ears of 
the present defendants if the peril of a reversal is realized. . . . We see no justification to force these defendants, who wish only 
to settle the present litigation, to act as unwilling private attorneys general and to bear the various costs and risks of litigation."")."
1420,16," It may be worth noting, although in and of itself it seems to us to prove little, that the Federal Circuit reversed district court 
determinations of patent invalidity at a relatively high rate during the relevant time period. See Donald R. Dunner et al., A 
Statistical Look at the Federal Circuit's Patent Decisions: 1982-1994, 5 Fed. Cir. B.J. 151, 154-55 (1995)."
1420,17," We thus think that it was appropriate for the district court to take these decisions into account for the limited purpose of 
rebutting the plaintiffs' conclusory allegation that the Federal Circuit would have affirmed Judge Broderick's decision invalidating 
the tamoxifen patent. See Mason v. Am. Tobacco Co., 346 F.3d 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2003) (""[L]egal conclusions, deductions or 
opinions couched as factual allegations are not given a presumption of truthfulness."" (internal quotation marks and citations "
1421,," omitted)), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1057, 124 S. Ct. 2163, 158 L. Ed. 2d 757 (2004); Smith v. Local 819 I.B.T. Pension Plan, 291 
F.3d 236, 240 (2d Cir. 2002) (""[C]onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice 
to prevent a motion to dismiss."" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted))."
1421,18," Indeed, our Circuit requires civil litigants to go through a pre-argument, Court-sponsored process called the Civil Appeals 
Management 
Plan 
(""CAMP""), 
see 
http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Docs/Forms/CAMP.pdf 
and http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Docs/Forms/Preargument.pdf, designed in part to facilitate just such post-judgment, pre-appellate 
argument settlements -- which it accomplishes with significant success. See Gilbert J. Ginsburg, The Case for a Mediation 
Program in the Federal Circuit, 50 Am. U. L. Rev. 1379, 1383 (2001) (reporting estimate that forty-five to fifty percent of civil 
cases pending before the Second Circuit settle each year). "
1422,19," In this case, Barr could not at the time of the Settlement Agreement count on obtaining the 180-day exclusive period from the 
FDA because, as a settler rather than a ""successful defender,"" it at least appeared that it was unlikely to be entitled to the period 
of exclusivity -- in other words, it appeared that, by settling, Barr was trading away its exclusivity period. It is noteworthy, 
nonetheless, that the 180-day period is of substantial benefit to the generic drug manufacturer who obtains it because it gives 
that manufacturer a significant head start over other manufacturers. See, e.g., Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs. Inc., 
386 F.3d 485, 494, 510 (2d Cir. 2004) (considering claim that defendant's first-mover status converted a transitory advantage 
into a permanent one, where plaintiffs provided testimony that ""even though its offer price to the Eckerd and CVS drugstore 
chains was as much as 25 percent below [the first mover's price], neither chain was willing to leave [the first mover] after having 
devoted substantial time to switching patients and getting their pharmacists comfortable with the new product""); Mova Pharm., 
955 F. Supp. at 131 (""All parties recognize that the earliest generic drug manufacturer in a specific market has a distinct 
advantage over later entrants.""). "
1423,20," It has been observed that even the typical settlement of the ordinary patent infringement suit appears to involve what may be 
characterized as a reverse payment. See Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 252 (""[E]ven in the traditional context, implicit 
consideration flows from the patent holder to the alleged infringer.""); cf. Asahi Glass, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 994 (""[A]ny settlement 
agreement can be characterized as involving 'compensation' to the defendant, who would not settle unless he had something to 
show for the settlement. If any settlement agreement is thus to be classified as involving a forbidden 'reverse payment,' we shall 
have no more patent settlements."" (emphasis in original)); Daniel A. Crane, Ease Over Accuracy in Assessing Patent 
Settlements, 88 Minn. L. Rev. 698, 700 (2004) (""It makes no sense to single out exclusion payments for disfavor when the same 
potential for collusion arises in any settlement involving the defendant's exit.""). A blanket rule that all settlements involving 
reverse payments are unlawful could thus conceivably endanger many ordinary settlements of patent litigation."
1423,21," The Federal Trade Commission and some commentators have proposed similar or even more stringent rules. See In re 
Schering-Plough Corp., No. 9297, final order at 4, 2003 WL 22989651, 2003 FTC LEXIS 187 (Fed. Trade Comm'n Dec. 8, 2003) 
(applying a rule under which generic manufacturers would not be permitted to receive reverse payments that exceeded ""the 
lesser of the [patent] [h]older's expected future litigation costs to resolve the Patent Infringement Claim or $ 2 million""), vacated, 
402 F.3d 1056 (11th Cir. 2005); Hovenkamp et al., supra, at 1759 (proposing that ""[i]n an antitrust challenge, a payment from a 
patentee to an infringement defendant for the latter's exit from the market is presumptively unlawful,"" and that the ""infringement 
plaintiff can defend by showing both (1) that the ex ante likelihood of prevailing in its infringement lawsuit is significant, and (2) 
that the size of the payment is no more than the expected value of litigation and collateral costs attending the lawsuit""). "
1424,22," The dissent questions what it sees as our reliance on the presumption of validity of the patent at the time of the settlement. 
Post at [16-17]. Even after a district court holds a patent invalid, it is treated as presumptively valid under 35 U.S.C. § 282 on 
appeal. See Rosco, Inc. v. Mirror Lite Co., 304 F.3d 1373, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2002). But irrespective of whether there was a 
presumption or where any such presumption lay at the time of settlement, we think that Zeneca was then entitled to protect its 
tamoxifen patent monopoly through settlement. The question for this Court is whether the settlement extended the patent's 
scope. If the judgment of the district court against a patent's validity put an end to the patent monopoly that the patent holder 
was entitled to protect, then any settlement after judgment of the district court holding the patent invalid would extend the patent 
monopoly beyond the patent's scope and therefore be unlawful. We do not think that to be the law, a view which appears to be 
consistent with the plaintiffs'. See Appellants' Reply Br. at 4, Heading ""B."" (""Hatch-Waxman Patent Infringement Litigation Can 
Be Settled, Even On Appeal, Without Violating The Antitrust Laws."")."
1424,23," There is authority for the proposition that when its patent monopoly is ended, the patent holder might actually raise the price 
on its branded product, rather than lower it in response to generic competition. See Congr. Budget Office, How Increased 
Competition from Generic Drugs Has Affected Prices and Returns in the Pharmaceutical Industry 29-31 (July 1998), available at 
http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/6xx/doc655/pharm.pdf (last visited May 12, 2005)."
1424,24," To illustrate using a vastly oversimplified hypothetical example (ignoring, for example, legal fees and costs): Suppose the 
patent holder is selling 1,000,000 pills per year at a $ 1 profit per pill (for a total profit of $ 1,000,000). The generic manufacturer 
files a paragraph IV ANDA, and the patent holder responds by bringing suit to protect its patent. If the patent holder projects that, 
should it lose the suit, it will thereafter sell only 250,000 pills per year at a $. 90 profit per pill (for a total profit of $ 225,000) in the 
competitive market, and the generic will sell 750,000 pills per year at a profit of $. 60 per pill (for a total profit of $ 450,000) -- so 
that total market profits are now down from $ 1,000,000 to $ 675,000 -- it would make economic sense for the patent holder to 
pay the generic manufacturer something more than the $ 450,000 the generic manufacturer would make in a competitive market 
to settle the litigation. If it paid $ 500,000 a year to the generic manufacturer -- $ 50,000 more than the generic manufacturer 
could earn in the market in a ""best case scenario"" -- for example, it would thereby retain the ability to make $ 500,000 per year 
selling its branded pills ($ 1,000,000 profit less $ 500,000 per year paid to the generic), $ 275,000 more per year than it would 
earn if it paid nothing to the generic but lost the patent litigation and with it the patent monopoly. It might well be sensible for the 
patent holder to enter into this sort of settlement, depending in part on its perceived prospects for winning the litigation, and it 
would seem difficult for the generic manufacturer to refuse. The $ 325,000 of yearly monopoly profits which accrued to the 
patent holder before the litigation began would thereafter be divided between the patent holder and the generic manufacturer. "
1426,25," It seems to us odd for the dissent to urge, in the context of this case, that we have not given proper weight to ""the public 
interest in having the validity of patents litigated."" Post at [9]. The Settlement Agreement was a virtual invitation to other generic 
manufacturers to file paragraph IV certifications and thereby court litigation as to the validity of the tamoxifen patent. It was an 
invitation that was accepted three times leading to three lawsuits, two of them litigated to judgment, as to the validity of the 
tamoxifen patent. Accepting the value of litigating the validity of patents in these circumstances, it has hardly been undermined 
here."
1426,26," The dissent ""see[s] no reason why the general standard for evaluating an anti-competitive agreement, i.e., its reasonableness, 
should not govern in this context."" Post at [13]. We think, such a rule, making every settlement of patent litigation, at least in the 
Hatch-Waxman Act context, subject to the inevitable, lengthy and expensive hindsight of a jury as to whether the settlement 
constituted a ""reasonable"" restraint (and, in this case, whether the Federal Circuit would have affirmed or reversed in a patent 
appeal), would place a huge damper on such settlements contrary to the law that we have discussed at some length that 
settlements are not only permitted, they are to be encouraged. "
1427,27," The reasoning of the dissent, which quotes an excerpt from this statement, post at [5], is, in our view, largely based on a 
repeated mis-characterization of our views in this regard. We do not, as the dissent states in one form or another many times, 
see post at [6], [7 - 9],[13], [16], and [18], think that there is a ""requirement"" that antitrust plaintiffs ""must show that the settled 
litigation was a sham, i.e., objectively baseless, before the settlement can be considered an antitrust violation . . . ,"" id. at [6]. 
There is no such requirement. The central criterion as to the legality of a patent settlement agreement is whether it ""exceeds the 
'scope of the patent's protection.'"" As we pointed out at the outset of this discussion, we think that ""[i]f the plaintiffs alleged facts 
that, if proved, would establish that the Settlement Agreement provided the defendants with benefits exceeding the scope of the 
tamoxifen patent, they would succeed in alleging an antitrust violation."" Ante at [26]; see also, e.g., post at [55] (""[T]he question 
is whether the ""exclusionary effects of the agreement"" exceed the 'scope of the patent's protection.' Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d 
at 1076.""). A plaintiff need not allege or prove sham litigation in order to succeed in establishing that a settlement has provided 
defendants ""with benefits exceeding the scope of the tamoxifen patent."" Whether there is fraud or baseless litigation may be 
relevant to the inquiry, but it is hardly, we think, ""the . . . standard,"" post at [14], as the dissent posits in order to take issue with 
it. "
1429,28," See Asahi Glass, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 994 (noting that in the typical reverse-payment case, ""the settlement leaves the 
competitive situation unchanged from before the defendant tried to enter the market."")."
1429,29," Of course, as it turned out, Zeneca was successful in subsequently protecting its patent in the courts. "
1430,30," ""The competitive concern is that the 180-day exclusivity provision can be used strategically by a patent holder to prolong its 
market power in ways that go beyond the intent of the patent laws and the Hatch-Waxman Act by delaying generic entry for a 
substantial period."" Balto, supra, at 331. An agreement that a ""generic manufacturer would not relinquish its 180-day exclusivity . 
. . prevent[s] other generic manufacturers from entering as well."" Id. at 335; see also Hovenkamp et al., supra, at 1755 (""It is 
widely understood that the 180-day exclusivity period offers the potential for collusive settlement arrangements between 
pioneers and generics. A pioneer could initiate a patent infringement suit against a first generic ANDA filer and settle the 
litigation with a 'non-entry' payment to the generic, under which the generic would delay commercialization of the generic 
product, thus postponing the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period and locking other generics out of the market 
indefinitely.""). "
1431,31," In Andrx, the defendant attempted unsuccessfully to claim that it was unable to cause any delay in generic entry because the 
""successful defense"" requirement would prevent it from doing so. Andrx Pharms., 256 F.3d at 810. The D.C. Circuit noted that 
the settlement agreement in that case was signed in September 1997 -- after the district court in Mova issued, in January 1997, 
a preliminary injunction banning the enforcement of the successful defense requirement. Id. (citing Mova Pharm., 955 F. Supp. 
at 131-32). Thus, ""[t]he timing of the Agreement and of the demise of the successful defense requirement defeats Andrx's 
argument on this point."" Id. In the instant case, however, the Settlement Agreement was executed long before Mova struck down 
the successful defense requirement."
1431,32," The dissent says that a reasonable fact-finder might conclude that sophisticated parties would not have included a provision 
that allowed Barr to re-file under paragraph IV absent an unlawfully anticompetitive purpose because it ""had no potential benefit 
to either of them"" apart from an anti-competitive one. Post at [19]. We disagree. If another generic manufacturer had been 
successful in having the tamoxifen patent held invalid, it was strongly and legitimately in Barr's interest to be able to re-file so 
that it could market tamoxifen without risking a violation of the Settlement Agreement. "
1433,1," Like the majority, I use ""Zeneca"" to refer collectively to defendants Zeneca, Inc., Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and 
AstraZeneca, Inc. ""Barr"" refers to defendant Barr Labs, Inc. "
1436,2," Noerr-Pennington immunity derives from both Noerr and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1436,3," The majority suggests, [majority op. at 53 n.25] that this interest was adequately protected through the subsequent suits by 
other generics. I disagree. This position ignores the time gap between the Barr-Zeneca litigation and the subsequent litigation. 
During this period, had Barr maintained its victory on appeal, which, as I explain below, was quite likely, very ill consumers would 
have had access to low cost generic tamoxifen. In addition, once Zeneca's patent protection was gone with respect to Zeneca, it 
was gone with respect to all generic manufacturers, which would have produced a very competitive market at the close of the 
180-day exclusivity period. Thus, it was very important to the public interest that Barr and Zeneca allow the appeal to proceed. 
This does not mean, as the majority suggests at 49 n.25 that any settlement of patent litigation after the challenger prevails at 
trial is an antitrust violation. As I discuss at [13-14] below, a Hatch-Waxman settlement agreement, even on appeal from a "
1437,," judgment declaring the patent invalid, is not a per se antitrust violation. Rather, a reviewing court must assess the reasonability 
of the settlement by weighing various factors including the strength of the patent as it appeared at the time of settlement."
1437,4," Of course, other generic challengers could file Paragraph IV certifications before the first litigation is resolved, but a second 
generic manufacturer has little incentive to incur the cost of litigation. Even if it wins, it will have to wait until after the first generic 
challenger's exclusivity period has expired to market its product. "
1438,5," The majority argues that applying the general rule of reasonableness would ""mak[e] every settlement of patent litigation, at 
least in the Hatch-Waxman Act context, subject to the inevitable, lengthy and expensive hindsight of a jury as to whether the 
settlement constituted a 'reasonable' restraint (and, in this case, whether the Federal Circuit would have affirmed or reversed in 
a patent appeal)"" and thus ""place a huge damper on such settlements."" Majority op. at [53 n.26]. I doubt that this doomsday 
scenario would, in fact, take place. Courts would eventually develop rules for judging the reasonableness of a settlement, and as 
with other litigation, the majority of cases would be resolved in motion practice. Moreover, the majority again emphasizes the 
acknowledged interest in settlements without acknowledging the absent party in Hatch Waxman litigation settlements, the 
consumer of medicines. Those consumers have no ability to affect the settlement, which, in some cases, may benefit both 
parties beyond any expectation they could have from the litigation itself while harming the consumer. There is a panglossian 
aspect to the majority's tacit assumption that the settling parties will not act to injure the consumer or competition. "
1439,6," The majority also relies on Boehm v. Commissioner, 146 F.2d 553 (2d Cir. 1945), aff'd, 326 U.S. 287, 66 S. Ct. 120, 90 L. Ed. 
78, 1945 C.B. 353 (1945). This case also is strikingly inapposite; the Boehm court held only that a taxpayer must claim a loss in 
the year it becomes obvious and cannot rely on the inherently speculative outcome of litigation seeking to recover some of that 
loss to justify claiming it in a later year. 146 F.2d at 555. The relevance of that principle to the case at hand is not immediately 
obvious to me. It is also interesting to note that the Supreme Court affirmed not on the impossibility of predicting litigation 
outcome but rather because the Tax Court had found that the suit had ""no substantial value"" and ""[t]here was no evidence in the 
stipulation of the merits of the suit, the probability of recovery or any assurance of collection of an amount sufficient to pay the 
creditors' claim . . . and to provide a sufficient surplus for stockholders."" 326 U.S. at 294. The majority's additional reliance on 
Asahi Glass Co. v. Pentech Pharms, 289 F. Supp. 2d 986, 993 (N.D. Il. 2003), and In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust 
Litig., 261 F. Supp. 2d. 188, 200-01 (E.D.N.Y. 2003), requires little discussion. The statement quoted from Asahi Glass that ""[n]o 
one can be certain that he will prevail in a patent suit""-is irrelevant to the capacity of skilled corporate counsel and district court 
judges to evaluate the likelihood that a determination of patent invalidity will be upheld, and the discussion in Ciprofloxacin relies 
primarily on Whitmore and Boehm, which I have already discussed. "
1440,7," I do not find persuasive the statistics the majority cites on the frequency of reversal in the Federal Circuit. These statistics 
would include decisions construing the patent and making other legal determinations. Therefore, they do nothing to show how 
frequently the Federal Circuit reverses credibility determinations on appeal."
1440,8," I recognize that it makes more sense to use the subsequent litigation to argue that plaintiffs could not prove the Zeneca lawsuit 
was not a sham. However, as noted, I do not believe this is an appropriate test. "
1451,1," In short, 3M's bundled rebate programs provided purchasers with significant discounts on 3M's products. The availability and 
size of the rebates, however, were dependent upon purchasers buying 3M products from multiple product lines. See  LePage's, 
Inc. v. 3M,324 F.3d 141, 154-55 (3d Cir. 2003). "
1453,2," The Court appointed the following as Class Counsel: Daniel A. Small and Brent W. Landau of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfield & Toll, 
P.L.L.C. (""CMHT""); and Joseph M. Vanek of Vanek, Vickers & Masini, P.C. (""VVM,"" previously ""Daar & Vanek, P.C."")."
1453,3," The term ""Plaintiffs' Counsel"" refers collectively to Class Counsel, as identified above, and the firm Trujillo, Rodriguez, and 
Richards, L.L.C. (""TRR""), which has served as local counsel for Plaintiffs. "
1454,4," Sixty-eight refers to the number of clearly non-duplicative responses that CCS had received from identified Class Members as 
of August 1, 2006. CCS received a total of seventy-two responses from identified Class Members, but four were identified as 
potentially duplicative. (Glenn Aff. P 13.) CCS also received thirty requests for inclusion in the Settlement Class from entities 
believing that they may be Class Members; of those requests, two entities were identified as additional Class Members, sent 
Notice, and given the opportunity to respond and become eligible to receive allocation from the Settlement Fund. (Id. P 14.) As 
of the Final Approval Hearing on August 8, 2006, no response from those entities had been received; their responses, however, 
did not need to be postmarked until August 7, 2006 (Id.), and thus may have been validly outstanding at the time of the Hearing. 
For greater detail regarding the Notice Plan, see infra Section III. A. "
1457,5," There is also a fourth consideration: ""(D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action."" Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D). The Court, however, need not consider this final factor in the context of a settlement-only class certification. 
See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620 (""Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire 
whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)(D), for the 
proposal is that there be no trial.""). "
1460,6," Based on the outcome of the LePage's litigation, the Court held that collateral estoppel applied to establish the following facts 
upon the trial of the Bradburn action:"
1460,1," . For the time period from June 11, 1993 [to] October 13, 1999, the relevant market in this matter is the market for invisible 
and transparent tape for home and office use in the United States;"
1460,2," . For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M possessed monopoly power in the relevant 
market, including the power to control prices and exclude competition in the relevant market;"
1460,3," . For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M willfully maintained such monopoly power by 
predatory or exclusionary conduct; and"
1460,4," . For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M's predatory or exclusionary conduct harmed 
competition. Bradburn, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375, 2005 WL 1388929, at *7. "
1461,7," As the Third Circuit has recently noted, ""The Girsh factors do not provide an exhaustive list of factors to be considered when 
reviewing a proposed settlement."" In re AT&T Corp. Sec. Litig.,455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *3 (3d Cir. 2006). In In re 
Prudential, for instance, the Third Circuit enumerated a list of additional considerations which may be relevant to a court's 
assessment of the fairness of a class action settlement. 148 F.3d at 323. After thorough review of the proposed Settlement in 
this case, the Court has found that all considerations relevant to its assessment of the Settlement's fairness are fully covered by 
the Court's analysis of the adequacy of the Notice, the nine Girsh factors, and the fairness of the Distribution Plan. "
1463,8," The collateral estoppel ruling in Bradburn only covers the Class Period up until October 13, 1999. Bradburn, 2005 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 11375, 2005 WL 1388929, at *7. "
1465,9," Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Court's Preliminary Approval Order, the Settlement Administrator was paid $ 
25,000 from the Settlement Fund on April 28, 2006 in partial payment of the costs of giving Notice to the Settlement Class; this 
amount is not included in Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for reimbursement. (Small Decl. P 74.)"
1465,10," The Court notes that Plaintiffs' Counsel expects to incur approximately $ 20,000 in additional claims administration costs prior 
to the distribution of the Settlement Fund. (Small Decl. II P 21.) These future expenses are not included in the present request, 
but Plaintiffs' Counsel will seek reimbursement for them in Plaintiffs' Counsel's anticipated motion with respect to distribution of 
the Settlement Fund. "
1467,11," The Court has determined that, in this case, all considerations relevant to its analysis of the fee award's reasonableness are 
covered fully by the Gunter and Prudential factors listed above. "
1468,12," The import of this absence of objections, while significant, should not be overstated. As the Third Circuit has noted, ""[c]lass 
members may have little incentive to oppose a fee request, since any reduction will only result in a minor increase in their share 
of the settlement."" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *6. "
1469,13," This survey calculated percentage of recovery by lumping the awards of attorneys' fees and expenses and dividing that sum 
by the aggregate class recovery, which differs from the methodology employed by the Court. For the sake of comparison, 
applying this survey's method of calculation to the present case would render a percentage of recovery for Plaintiffs' Counsel of 
28.4%. "
1470,14," The breakdown amidst the three firms is as follows: CMHT, indicating a lodestar of $ 944,551 for 2,885.05 hours (resulting in 
an hourly rate of $ 327.40); VVM, indicating a lodestar of $ 436,199 for 1,133.60 hours (hourly rate of $ 384.79); and TRR, 
indicating a lodestar of $ 192,025.50 for 489.90 hours (hourly rate of $ 391.97). (Small Decl. P 69, Small Decl. II P 12.) "
1476,15," The United States submitted a letter stating that, under federal law, it ""cannot be represented by private counsel in a class 
action lawsuit"" and that ""[a]s a result, the United States Attorney General does not agree to the inclusion of the federal 
government as a class member in this Rule 23 litigation."" "
1478,1," This appeal was calendared for argument on March 1, 2006, and was adjourned by the court at the request of counsel to a 
telephonic argument. "
1482,2," The return date of the motion was February 6, 2004. "
1503,1," The defendants named in the complaint are AT&T Cellular Services, Inc.; Cellular Telephone Company; AT&T Wireless 
Services, Inc.; AB Cellular LA, LLC; AT&T Corporation (collectively ""AT&T Wireless"" or ""AT&T defendants""); Cingular Wireless 
LLC; Cingular Wireless Spectrum Sub B LLC; Pacific Telesis Mobile Services, LLC (collectively ""Cingular"" or ""Cingular 
defendants""); Sprint Corporation; Sprint Spectrum LP; Sprint PCS License LLC (collectively ""Sprint"" or ""Sprint defendants""); 
Cellco Partnership; Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership; Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership-Airtouch Cellular 
(collectively ""Verizon"" or ""Verizon Wireless defendants""); T-Mobile USA, Inc.; Voicestream GSM II, LLC; Omnipoint NY MTA 
License (collectively ""T-Mobile"" or ""T-Mobile defendants""). Although the complaint and plaintiffs' papers refer to the defendants 
as the five largest wireless carriers in the United States, two of them (AT&T Wireless and Cingular) merged in 2004. See In re 
Wireless Tel. Servs. Antitrust Litig., 385 F. Supp. 2d 403, 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). "
1504,2," Hereinafter, all citations and references to In re Wireless shall refer to the Summary Judgment Opinion. "
1505,3," The first motion for class certification (in the Brook phase of this litigation) was submitted at approximately the same time as the 
defendants' motion for summary judgment. Because summary judgment was granted, it was unnecessary to rule on the motion 
for class certification. See In re Wireless, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 408 n.4. "
1506,4," This fact puts the Court in the somewhat unusual position of having to refrain from evaluating the plaintiffs' case on the merits 
while deciding the motion for class certification almost a year after it has undertaken a careful examination of much of their 
evidence, and on the eve of the submission of summary judgment motions in the Freeland action. "
1507,5," There is no allegation of coordination among defendants in setting specifications for features other than handset locks. Thus, 
each defendant appears to be able independently to dictate the features of handsets to be activated on its own network. "
1510,6," Plaintiffs' expert Professor Nicholas Economides identifies a litany of anticompetitive effects of the defendants' locking and 
tying practices that he claims has injured members of the class. The plaintiffs do not attempt in their briefs, though, to establish 
antitrust injury by reference to any of these other effects. Nor could they. HN15[
] An antitrust plaintiff in an action for damages 
lacks antitrust standing if she cannot establish an antitrust injury ""that translates into reasonably quantifiable damages."" Daniel v. 
Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 438 (2d Cir. 2005). Plaintiffs in this action have not offered any methodology to 
demonstrate that damages related to the other injuries identified by Economides are reasonably quantifiable. As a result, they 
lack antitrust standing to seek redress for any of these other claimed injuries. "
1511,," Similarly, the complaint alleges that the alleged conspiracy has ""cause[d] artificially elevated market prices for cellular and PCS 
services,"" but the plaintiffs do not invoke inflated service prices in their briefs as an antitrust injury nor do they offer any 
methodology by which an increase in service prices could be proven on a classwide basis. See, infra, at 26 n.7."
1511,7," A second expert for plaintiffs, Gary French, proposed a method to calculate damages attributable to overpayment for service by 
customers who continue to subscribe to wireless service after their initial contract period has expired. While plaintiffs have 
included his estimate of total damages in their own total figure, they did not rely on this part of French's report anywhere in their 
arguments that injury could be established by generalized proof. This omission might reflect an implied concession that French's 
report does not show that injury can be proven on a classwide basis. By French's own admission, only 7.5% to 21% of class 
members have suffered this type of damage. French's estimate thus falls far short of ""posit[ing] class-wide injury resulting from 
every single class member's overpaying"" for service."
1511,8," Neither Economides nor the plaintiffs explain how the elimination of low-cost handset models from the market is substantively 
any different from the incorporation of advanced (and expensive) features into all new models brought into the market. "
1512,9," Although Economides actually performs three separate regression analyses, each one includes a BLS index as the single 
explanatory variable. Economides intended for each of these indices to function independently as a proxy for factors affecting 
the wholesale costs of handsets. Thus, while the estimates generated by the regressions differ somewhat, no one regression 
was intended to generate substantively more (or different) information than any other. This is also why Economides bases his 
forecast on the results of a single regression analysis. For these reason, this Opinion will refer to Economides's report as if it 
consisted of a single regression analysis."
1512,10," ""Dichotomous variables of this kind are called 'dummy variables' because their values are conventional rather than inherent."" 
Craik v. Minn. St. Univ. Bd., 731 F.2d 465, 508 (8th Cir. 1984). "
1513,11," Thus, when the Court of Appeals upheld the exclusion of a regression analysis in Bickerstaff, it discussed only the proponent's 
failure. See Bickerstaff, 196 F.3d at 449. The court neither cited Sobel nor implied any burden on the opponent of the evidence. 
Id.; see also Hollander v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 172 F.3d 192, 202-04 (2d Cir. 1999) (upholding trial court's decision that plaintiff's 
flawed expert report was inadmissible); Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 66-68 (2d Cir. 1997) (same). "
1514,12," Economides similarly failed to investigate his assertion that camcorders had undergone a similar shift from analog to digital 
without an effect on average price. He offers no evidence that would show, for example, that digital and analog camcorders were 
the same price, or that the shift from digital to analog occurred at the same rate for camcorders as handsets. Carlton, on the 
other hand, cited a BLS study suggesting that digital camcorders were in fact more expensive than analog camcorders and that 
analog camcorders were available for sale after analog handsets had been phased out. If the shift to digital technology in 
camcorders occurred more gradually, such that the more expensive digital camcorders were replacing cheaper analog models at 
a slower rate, then the effect of the shift on overall average price would reasonably be expected to be less pronounced."
1514,13," ""When two or more variables are highly, but not perfectly, correlated -- that is, when there is multicollinearity -- the regression 
can be estimated, but some concerns remain. The greater the multicollinearity between two variables, the less precise are the 
estimates of individual regression parameters."" Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 197 (2d ed. 
2000) (""Reference Manual""); see also id. at 189 n.29 (""A more precise estimate of a parameter is an estimate with a smaller 
standard error.""). The plaintiffs do not contend that there is a perfect correlation between the variable they have selected (the 
price of component or comparator goods) and the shift to digital technology in handsets. "
1515,14," The ABA Section of Antitrust Law suggests that ""if the purpose of the regression exercise is to forecast (e.g., to forecast but-
for prices into some 'tainted' period based upon a regression model fitted only using data from the benchmark period), 
multilcollinearity is of little concern."" ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Econometrics: Legal, Practical, and Technical Issues 22 
(2005) (""Econometrics""). Economides's regression (at least those without the dummy variables) were apparently designed for 
precisely this purpose. The Section of Antitrust Law further suggests that simply excluding a multicollinear variable, as Economides did, may be an 
inappropriate method of addressing the problem. ""[T]he effect of omitting a statistically significant variable that by definition is 
correlated with another dependent variable violates the statistical assumption that the error terms are not correlated with the 
independent variables."" Id. at 68. Neither the defendants nor their experts made either of these arguments, however. "
1516,15," See BLS Handbook, supra, Ch. 14 at 3; id., Ch. 15 at 156, available at http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch15.pdf. The 
BLS Handbook goes on to describe the use of hedonic regression analysis to capture the impact of changing characteristics on 
product price change. See BLS Handbook, supra, Ch. 14 at 4 (""Hedonic regressions estimate the functional relationship 
between the characteristics embodied in the products in a market and the products' prices. Such regressions yield estimates of 
'implicit prices' for specified product characteristics that may be used to value the quality improvement resulting from changes in 
the various characteristics embodied in a product. The value of the quality improvement can then be removed from the reported 
price change to obtain a measure of the pure price change . . . .""). The parties did not discuss whether such a method would be 
appropriate in this case. "
1517,16," Plaintiffs offer the Economides report to establish antitrust injury in their conspiracy and restraint of trade claims as well as 
their tying claim. The injury claimed, though, remains the same for all: an increase in price of one product sold as part of a 
bundle. Because such bundling practices are most regularly challenged in tying claims, it is from the tying case law that 
guidance must be sought in an attempt to evaluate the injury claimed by plaintiffs here. The principles gleaned from those cases 
are equally applicable to consideration of plaintiffs' non-tying claims."
1517,17," Why they have not done so is unclear, particularly in light of their frequent complaint that it was ""extremely difficult"" to 
determine the price of the handset alone. "
1518,18," Economides has explicitly disclaimed any opinion that the defendants' practices have allowed handset manufacturers to enrich 
themselves at the defendants' expense. "
1522,19," Plaintiffs do not dispute defendants' contention that Sprint service utilizes unique network technology and a different software 
platform than the other carriers. Nor do they allege that Sprint chose its unique network technology and software platform ""for 
the purpose of tying the products, rather than to achieve some technologically beneficial result."" Response of Carolina, Inc. v. 
Leasco Response, Inc., 537 F.2d at 1330; see also In re Wireless, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 408 (noting that a number of digital 
technologies were introduced in the 1990s following the FCC's decision to decline to maintain a technological standard for digital 
service). Thus, to the extent that a consumer must purchase a Sprint handset (though not necessarily one purchased from Sprint 
itself as part of a tied transaction) in order to obtain complete Sprint service, this reflects the benign reality that a handset 
formatted to operate on a different carrier's network will not be fully functional on the Sprint network. Any company policy 
requiring the use of Sprint handsets on the network is basically a redundancy."
1522,20," Defendants admit to subsidizing the purchase price of handsets in an effort to attract new customers by offering low up-front 
costs for starting wireless service. These subsidies are then recovered, at least in part, through service fees over time. This 
creates the possibility that, even if the purchase of a handset is not a condition of purchase of wireless service, the payment of a 
handset subsidy is. To the extent this is a tying arrangement, it is not the tie alleged by the plaintiffs. And even if it were, this 
does not constitute actual coercion in which consumers are forced to purchase their handsets from their service providers. The 
practice of subsidization is a silent condition and does not show that all consumers reasonably understood that handsets may 
not be obtained elsewhere. "
1523,21," Because common questions do not predominate over individual questions, it is unnecessary to determine whether a class 
action would be a superior means of adjudication of this case. Suffice it for now to observe that the individual hearings on the 
issues of antitrust injury and coercion would be sufficiently burdensome that, even if common questions did predominate, there 
would be serious difficulties with the management of the class action. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice, at § 23.46[2][e] (""If . . . 
there is a need for a significant number of separate trials, the class action is unmanageable."")."
1523,22," It is true that a plaintiffs may bring an action for injunctive relief pursuant to the Clayton Act for a Sherman Act violation without 
suffering an actual injury. Kruman v. Christie's Intern. PLC, 284 F.3d 384, 397 (2d Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds, F. 
Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004). The plaintiff ""need only 
demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely 
to continue or recur."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 
(1969). Nevertheless, the Clayton Act does not authorize ""an injunction against a threatened injury for which he would not be 
entitled to compensation if the injury actually occurred,"" and the plaintiff must therefore still demonstrate that the threatened 
injury is an antitrust injury. Cargill, 479 U.S. at 112. In this case, the injury complained of has already been suffered, and for 
reasons described in Subsection C.1.b above, the plaintiffs in this case have failed to demonstrate that they can prove antitrust 
injury through generalized proof. "
1524,23," The AT&T, Cingular, Sprint, and T-Mobile defendants separately have renewed their arguments made in connection with the 
Brook motion for class certification that certification of a class including their customers would be improper because of arbitration 
agreements contained in their service contracts. Because the plaintiffs' motion for certification is denied in its entirety, it is 
unnecessary to address this argument. "
1542,34," Defendants try to read into this brief footnote more than is warranted. In light of the complexity and confusion in the law on this 
issue, it is hard to believe that this somewhat Delphic footnote will bear the weight which Defendants place on it. "
1543,35," It is noteworthy that cases involving the FTC's determinations of materiality are consistent with the Court's finding here, even 
though such cases are brought pursuant to the FTC Act rather than the RICO statute. As a general rule, HN57[
] deceptive 
advertising or claims permit an inference ""that the deception will constitute a material factor in a purchaser's decision to buy."" 
FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 391-92, 85 S. Ct. 1035, 13 L. Ed. 2d 904 (1965); see also FTC v. Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 250 U.S. App. D.C. 162, 778 F.2d 35, 40-43 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that deceptive advertising 
touting Defendants' low tar cigarettes created an ""inherent tendency to deceive"" consumers and was material); FTC v. Wilcox, 
926 F. Supp. 1091, 1098 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (""Express claims or deliberately-made implied claims used to induce the purchase of a 
particular product or service are presumed to be material""). Moreover, materiality is presumed for matters that ""significantly 
involve health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned."" Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 343 U.S. 
App. D.C. 111, 223 F.3d 783, 786 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Deception Statement, 103 FTC at 182); see also Kraft, Inc. v. FTC, 
970 F.2d 311, 322 (7th Cir. 1992). "
1545,36," Defendants also may not escape liability for their scheme to defraud by claiming that the public was not injured by their 
misconduct. HN59[
] To establish a mail or wire fraud violation, a plaintiff is not required to prove that: (1) the wrongdoer 
succeeded in deceiving or defrauding the intended victim; (2) the victim suffered any loss of money, property, or other harm; or 
(3) the intended victim detrimentally relied upon the wrongdoer's fraudulent misconduct. See Philip Morris, Inc., 304 F. Supp. 2d 
at 69-70; Philip Morris, Inc., 116 F. Supp. 2d 131 at 153; Philip Morris, Inc., 273 F. Supp. 2d 3 at 6. Thus, ""the common-law 
requirements of justifiable reliance and damages . . . plainly have no place in the federal statutes."" Neder, 527 U.S. 1 at 24-25, 
119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35."
1545,37," Before trial in this case, Defendants raised a number of affirmative defenses. The Court granted the Government's Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment for these defenses as to liability. See Order # 476; see also Order # 227, # 356, # 509, # 538, and # 
586. However, at that time the Court reserved judgment about how these affirmative defenses might apply to remedies. See 
Mem. Op. to Order # 476 at 27 n.21. Defendants now appropriately raise the same affirmative defenses in regard to remedies. Repeating the arguments from their pre-trial brief, Defendants again assert that waiver, laches, unclean hands, in pari delicto, 
and equitable estoppel bar any claim for relief by the Government. See Defs.' Post-Trial Br. on Affirmative Defenses 18, Sept. 7, 
2005. As in the pre-trial brief on affirmative defenses, Defendants' make the broad argument that because the Federal Trade 
Commission has had an historical role regulating tobacco products, the Court cannot grant the Government any relief in this 
action. See Defs.' Post-Trial Reply Br. in Support of Their Affirmative Defenses 1, Sept. 29, 2005. In previously rejecting this 
theory and Defendants' affirmative defenses in regards to liabilities, this Court found that, ""the case law overwhelmingly supports 
the Government's position"" that the enumerated equitable defenses may not be asserted against the United States ""when, as 
here, 'it is acting in its sovereign capacity to exercise public rights to protect the public interest.'"" United States v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., 300 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65-66 (D.D.C. 2004) (internal citations omitted). Significantly, the facts have not changed since Defendants asked this Court to rule on affirmative defenses in the liability stage 
of this matter. Furthermore, Defendants have not put forth any new arguments or cited any new precedent for why the Court 
should rule in favor of the affirmative defenses they now re-raise as to remedies. Therefore, this Court finds that the affirmative 
defenses now re-raised by Defendants as to remedies do not preclude the United States from obtaining relief. "
1546,38," The first two elements are also required to establish the substantive RICO violation, which has been addressed supra, in 
Sections VII(C) and (D). "
1547,39," As discussed in great detail, infra at Section VIII(C), Liggett withdrew from the conspiracy in 1997. Accordingly, Liggett is not 
liable as a conspirator for any acts that occurred subsequent to 1997. "
1548,40," As noted earlier, no evidence has been presented regarding a conspiracy before 1953. "
1549,41," Contrary to Altria's claim, the prohibition against intracorporate conspiracies under the antitrust laws does not apply to this 
case. In Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7[th] Cir. 1989), the Seventh Circuit explained: Since a subsidiary and its parent theoretically have a community of interest, a conspiracy ""in restraint of trade"" between 
them poses no threat to the goals of antitrust law -- protecting competition. In contrast, intracorporate conspiracies do 
threaten RICO's goals of preventing the infiltration of legitimate businesses by racketeers and separating racketeers from 
their profits."
1549,875," F.2d at 1281 (citations omitted). Accordingly, because Altria conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is liable under RICO 
conspiracy, even though one of the Defendants with which Altria conspired was Philip Morris USA, Altria's subsidiary. "
1550,42," Withdrawal does not preclude liability even in criminal prosecutions involving substantive mail and wire fraud offenses. For 
example, in United States v. Read, 658 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1981), the Seventh Circuit explained the differences between the 
application of the withdrawal defense to substantive, as opposed to conspiracy, offenses. In holding that withdrawal was not a 
defense to substantive mail and securities fraud offenses, the court explained, ""A party's 'withdrawal' from a scheme is [] no 
defense to the crime because membership in the scheme is not an element of the offense. [The defendant] is liable for mail 
fraud as a principal or as an aider and abettor, not a conspirator."" Id. at 1240; accord United States v. Waldrop, 786 F.Supp. 
1194, 1201 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (""withdrawal is no defense to mail fraud""), aff'd, 983 F.2d 1054 (3d Cir. 1992) (Table). Accordingly, 
Liggett's withdrawal from the RICO conspiracy does not preclude its liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) for the substantive mail 
and wire fraud offenses that underlie the civil RICO lawsuit for equitable relief brought by the United States. "
1552,43," See, e.g., United States v. Private Sanitation Indus. Ass'n, 995 F.2d 375, 377 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Local 30, United 
Slate, etc., 871 F.2d 401, 408-09 (3d Cir. 1989); United States v. Local 1804-1, International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 831 F. 
Supp. 177, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); United States v. Local 295 of Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, 784 F. Supp. 15, 19-22 (E.D.N.Y.

traditions tend to endure long after specific individuals are gone"") (id. at 19); Local 6A, 663 F. Supp. at 194-95. "
1553,44," Schindler acknowledged at trial that ""[i]f R.J. Reynolds wanted to convey the message on its Website that smoking causes 
disease, it could say that unequivocally,"" and that he could make it happen ""in a heartbeat,"" but he would not do so. Schindler 
TT, 1/24/05, 10816:25-10817:5, 10821:2-18."
1553,45," From 1999-2001, the Philip Morris website publicly stated its disagreement with the scientific consensus as well: Many scientists and regulators have concluded that ETS poses a health risk to nonsmokers. Even though we do not agree 
with many of their conclusions, below we have provided some links so you can access some of their views. (no bates) (US 92056 at 2); Parrish TT, 11080:23-11082:14. "
1554,," While this case was pending, Philip Morris revised its position on ETS to delete its disagreement with the conclusions of 
""scientists and regulators."" Philip Morris now states: ""Public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke from 
cigarettes causes disease, including lung cancer and heart disease in nonsmoking adults"" as well as a number of adverse health 
effects in children. (no bates) (US 92055 at 1). "
1555,46," HN77[
] A defendant seeking to escape a permanent injunction bears the burden of demonstrating that ""subsequent events 
made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur."" United States v. 
Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) (emphasis added); United 
States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S. Ct. 894, 97 L. Ed. 1303 (1953). "
1556,47," In an effort to demonstrate that it is not reasonably likely to violate RICO in the United States in the future, BATCo argues that 
it conducts no business in the United States and that it is unlikely to have anything more than ""incidental"" contact with tobacco 
manufacturers in the United States. JD Br. at 126-127. In addition to the fact that future action within the United States is not 
required, each of these assertions is inaccurate. First, BATCo conducts business in the United States through an agreement 
with Lane Limited (which is now owned by Reynolds American, Inc.), which sells and markets millions of BATCo's State Express "
1557,555," brand cigarettes in the United States. (no bates) (US 77453). Second, BATCo continues to participate with other Defendants 
in international organizations that play an important role in the operation of the Enterprise, such as Tobacco Mfrs. Association 
and CECCM. Third, BATCo remains closely affiliated with Reynolds American, Inc., the parent company of R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. See JD FF Chap. 12, § IV.D.1. PP 338, 343, 345. In light of 
BATCo's extensive participation in the Enterprise's violations of 1962(c) and (d) and the ongoing activities described here, the 
Court finds BATCo's arguments on its reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations wholly unpersuasive. "
1559,48," Liggett today is the fifth largest producer of cigarettes in the United States. LeBow WD, 11. "
1560,49," Moreover, because Liggett engages in virtually no consumer advertising, there is little opportunity for it to influence smoker 
beliefs concerning low-tar cigarettes. See JD Final Proposed Findings of Fact. "
1561,50," Recently, the Tenth Circuit, without expressing an ""opinion regarding whether, or in what circumstances, disgorgement is 
authorized under RICO"" held that the presence of the term ""restrain"" in a statutory grant of general equity jurisdiction is not 
dispositive evidence of Congress's intent to limit remedies to those that are forward-looking."" United States v. Rx Depot, Inc., 
438 F.3d 1052, 1058-1059 (10th Cir. 2006) (declining to apply the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the term ""restrain"" and 
upholding the Supreme Court interpretation permitting disgorgement as a forward-looking remedy in cases brought under § 
332(a) of the FDCA). Rx Depot followed virtually the same analysis of a court's equitable powers to ""restrain"" violations as this 
Court did in Order # 550, relying heavily on Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S. Ct. 1086, 90 L. Ed. 1332 
(1946) and concluding that disgorgement is allowed under the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which states that ""district 
courts . . . shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown to restrain violations."" Id."
1561,51," This determination has created a Circuit split. Contrary to the D.C. Circuit, both the Fifth and Second Circuits have adopted a 
standard of relief that permits disgorgement where it will prevent and restrain future RICO violations. As the Second Circuit 
reasoned, disgorgement may serve the goal of preventing and restraining future violations where ""there is a finding that the 
gains are being used to fund or promote the illegal conduct, or constitute capital for that purpose."" United States v. Carson, 52 
F.3d 1173, 1182 (2nd Cir. 1995); see also Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, 355 F.3d 345, 354-355 (5th Cir. 2003) 
(adopting the standard set forth by the Second Circuit but denying disgorgement on other grounds). "
1564,52," Defendants claim that prohibition of their deceptive use of descriptors ""would improperly invade the primary jurisdiction of the 
FTC,"" JD PFOF, ch. 15 Ore. 20, 13 P 599, but ""[t]he FTC does not impose, regulate, or require [descriptors]. How those terms "
1565,," are applied, and on which brands, is entirely up to the tobacco companies."" Henningfield WD, 56:8-11. Further, Defendants' 
claim reiterates their previous argument that such relief is preempted by the FTC Act, an argument which the Court has already 
rejected. See United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 2d 72, 74 (D.D.C. 2003). "
1567,53," Defendants' argument that requiring corrective statements on package onserts would conflict with the Federal Cigarette 
Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq. (""FCLAA"") is unconvincing. This remedy falls within the narrow scope of 
equitable powers granted to the Court under Section 1964(a) because it specifically prevents and restrains Defendants from 
continuing to make statements about smoking and health that are fraudulent and misleading in vehicles which are likely to reach 
consumers. It does not implicate Section 5(a) of the FCLAA, because Section 5(a) only prohibits ""state and federal rulemaking 
bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements"" on cigarette packages. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 
518, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992). HN85[
] Under the FCLAA, a ""package"" is defined as ""a pack, box, carton, or container of any kind in which cigarettes are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers."" 15 U.S.C. § 1332(4). 
An onsert, which is only a small informational brochure attached to the outside of the ""pack box, carton, or container . . . in which 
cigarettes are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers,"" is not a package. Therefore, the remedy at issue 
does not implicate the FCLAA's preemption provision. "
1570,54," Disaggregated data is data broken down by type of marketing, brand, geographical region, number of cigarettes sold, 
advertising in stores, and any other category of data collected and/or maintained by or on behalf of each Defendant regarding 
their cigarette marketing efforts."
1570,55," The Government has also requested a specific injunction against Defendants' ongoing and future youth marketing. Although 
such a remedy would certainly serve the public interest, it does not prevent and restrain future RICO violations, which, in this 
case, are not Defendants' continuing efforts to market to youth but rather their false denials of those efforts. Accordingly, 
because this injunction does not meet the standard set forth in Judge Sentelle's Opinion, the Court cannot enter such a remedy. "
1571,56," Dr. Gruber based his youth smoking reduction targets on the 1997 Proposed Resolution, a draft settlement proposed by 
certain Defendants to Congress when it was considering federal regulation of the tobacco industry and resolution of all pending 
tobacco lawsuits. As Defendants vigorously argue, because the 1997 Resolution was never adopted and was merely part of a 
comprehensive settlement package, it would not be an appropriate basis for setting targets for reductions in youth smoking. In addition, Dr. Gruber proposed, as one possible means for decreasing youth smoking rates, that Defendants use price 
increases alone to effectuate the necessary reductions. Dr. Gruber did note that Defendants have at their disposal many other 
tools by which they could choose to achieve the targets, but that price increases alone could yield the same result, if Defendants 
chose to take that course. In response, Defendants raised the concern that, with price increases, they would lose some market "
1572,," share (however minimal) to tobacco manufacturers who are party to neither this Order nor the MSA. As a result, those 
manufacturers could market to youth without any restrictions and thus undermine the very purpose of Dr. Gruber's proposal. This 
effect, if it occurred, would be of concern. "
1573,57," As is obvious, the Court is not entering as remedies either the proposed national smoker cessation program or the proposed 
public education and countermarketing campaign. Accordingly, Joint Defendants' Motion for Judgment on Partial Findings 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) with Respect to Certain Remedies Sought by the United States is denied as moot. "
1574,58," Rule 54(d) of the FRCP states: HN89[
] ""Except when express provisions therefor is made either in a statute of the United 
States or in these rules, costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court 
otherwise directs."" "
1599,1," It would appear this situation continues even to the present. For example, in this very litigation, a former long-time career 
government lawyer was so intent on representing a company aligned with the Defendants that he grossly misrepresented in his 
pleadings and declaration to the Court the degree and substance of his earlier participation as government counsel in related 
litigation involving the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, he was disqualified from representing Defendant-Intervenor 
BATAS. See Order #915. "
1601,2," As the Court has noted for the record on numerous occasions, Dr. Kessler is not related in any way. "
1602,3," One cannot help wondering whether this litigation was the best vehicle for attempting to hold Defendants accountable for their 
indifference to the health of American citizens. In a democracy, it is the body elected by the people, namely Congress, that 
should step up to the plate and address national issues with such enormous economic, public health, commercial, and social 
ramifications, rather than the courts which are limited to deciding only the particular case presented to them in litigation. 
However, this will certainly not be the first, nor the last, time that litigants seek to use the courts and existing legislation to 
address broad-scale economic and social problems which might be far better and more appropriately grappled with by our 
elected representatives."
1602,4," The eleven Defendants were: Philip Morris, Inc., now Philip Morris USA, Inc. (""Philip Morris""), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., now 
Reynolds American (""R.J. Reynolds""), Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., now part of Reynolds American (""Brown & 
Williamson""), Lorillard Tobacco Company (""Lorillard""), The Liggett Group, Inc. (""Liggett""), American Tobacco Co., merged with 
Brown & Williamson which is now part of Reynolds American (""American Tobacco""), Philip Morris Cos., now Altria (""Altria""), 
B.A.T. Industries p.l.c. (""BAT Ind.""), now part of BATCo, British American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd. (""BATCo""), The Council for 
Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc. (""CTR""), and The Tobacco Institute, Inc. (""TI""). The latter two entities do not manufacture or sell 
tobacco products, but are alleged to be co-conspirators in Defendants' tortious activities. BAT Ind. has been dismissed for lack of 
personal jurisdiction. All Defendants but Liggett joined together in common defense (the ""Joint Defendants""). In 2003, the Court 
granted the Motion of British American Tobacco Australian Services, Ltd. (""BATAS"") to intervene for the limited purpose of 
asserting and protecting its interests in litigation documents. Order #449."

1603,6," These allegations have been further described in U.S. v. Philip Morris Inc., 116 F.Supp.2d at 136-38. "
1604,7," To the extent that they are relevant, all arguments of the intervenors and amici have been considered and addressed."
1604,8," ""Enterprise"" is a statutory term contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The Court's use of it in these Findings does not imply that 
Defendants' activities meet the statutory definition contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). That issue will be fully discussed in the 
Conclusions of Law. "
1605,9," All of these studies will be discussed in much greater detail in Section IV, infra. "
1659,10, Lorillard did not participate in the second phase of funding for the Brotman/Freedman research. (US 30450). 
1695,11," While the Court has not relied upon certain portions of Dr. Brandt's testimony, a careful review of all of Dr. Brandt's testimony, 
the documents he cited, and the documents which Defendants cited to rebut his testimony reveals that many of Defendants' 
characterizations of both the testimony and individual documents are out of context, unrepresentative, and unfair. "
1735,12," Defendant Altria, which was originally incorporated in 1985 as Philip Morris Companies Inc., effectively and actively controls 
the activities of all of its subsidiaries, including Defendant Philip Morris USA Inc., Philip Morris Companies, and Philip Morris 
International, Inc. (""PM International""). Overall policies on all major aspects of Altria operating companies' operations are set by 
Altria management, and senior Altria executives, employees, and agents participate in and/or control decisions about how the 
operating companies implement those policies, through both formal and informal reporting relationships. Berlind PD, United 
States v. Philip Morris, 5/23/02, 8:4-10:13; 2071412978-3143 (US 23061*). "

1779,14," BAT had a complex, but close, financial relationship with Imperial Tobacco Company. "
1789,15," Cipollone v. Liggett Group, 505 U.S. 504, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992), was one of the first tobacco lawsuits in 
which the industry was assessed damages. It was particularly significant to the industry because it involved the unprecedented 
use of thousands of internal industry documents. "
1871,16," Defendants make the claim that their efforts to manipulate nicotine delivery were well-known in the public health community 
and therefore cannot be the source of a fraud claim. However, Defendants have taken internally inconsistent positions. While 
making these claims, they simultaneously argued and presented evidence to support their position that they did not manipulate 
nicotine delivery. Defendants cannot have it both ways. Moreover, while it is true that the public health community had some "
1872,," understanding of Defendants' design parameters, that understanding fell far short of the much more sophisticated understanding 
which Defendants possessed and utilized."
1872,17," Defendants assert that the statements of their C.E.O.s before the Waxman Subcommittee in 1994 constitutes petitioning 
activity protected from any imposition of liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See, Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference 
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 
U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). This legal issue is addressed fully in the Conclusions of Law. The facts, as 
recounted herein, speak for themselves. "
1880,18," The Court is distinguishing between cigarettes which actually reduce the smoker's consumption of harmful constituents and 
those which, despite their marketing, do not (e.g., light/low tar cigarettes). See Section V(E), infra. "
1885,19," There are conditions under which a ventilated cigarette yields higher tar and nicotine levels than those measured using the 
FTC method. See Section V(C)(2)(c)((2)), supra. "
1887,20," The terms ""charcoal"" or ""activated carbon"" were often used interchangeably during the trial to describe these filters. See, e.g., 
Townsend TT, 3/8/05, 14675:25-14676:16. For the sake of simplicity, the Court uses the term ""charcoal"" to refer to filters 
containing activated carbon material. "
1891,21," Once discovered by RJR, Philip Morris contributed $35 million to tobacco growers to convert their tobacco curing facilities. 
Philip Morris now requires flue-cured tobacco from all its growers. Szymanczyk WD, 172:12-21. "
1899,22," While Defendants told the Court that they intended to produce Dr. DiMarco to explain these events, and he was on the 
defense witness list (see Juchatz TT, 11/18/04, 6618:21-6619:8), Defendants did not call him. "

Employed in Determining Tar and Nicotine Content of Cigarettes (Nov. 30, 1966), JD 004748. "
1927,25," To rebut the testimony of Drs. Benowitz, Burns, Henningfield, and Farone regarding smoker compensation, Defendants relied 
upon tobacco industry scientist Michael Dixon, Ph.D., an employee of Defendant BATCo, to testify as an expert in ""human 
smoking behavior."" Dr. Dixon testified that compensation is not complete because smokers compensate for tar not nicotine. Dr. 
Dixon is neither a medical doctor nor an epidemiologist; he holds a Ph.D. in respiratory physiology. Dr. Dixon further admitted 
that nowhere in his written direct examination did he even mention the subject of nicotine addiction. He has not published any 
articles on the subject of nicotine addiction, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that he has published a single peer-
reviewed publication on any subject. Without any expertise in nicotine addiction, Dr. Dixon's testimony as to whether nicotine 
addiction drives smokers to compensate is not credible, especially when compared to the totally contrary evidence of 
government experts Benowitz, Burns, and Henningfield, each of whom has enormous expertise in the fields of nicotine addiction 
and smoking and health, have written numerous peer reviewed articles on these subjects, and have participated in the rigorous 
process of writing different Surgeon General's Reports on smoking and health. Dixon WD, 2:1-8, 3:1-9; Dixon TT, 3/9/05, 
14917:5-9, 14960:16-14961:7, 14997:6-15001:11. "
1934,26," Dr. Jerry Whidby and Dr. Joseph Mulholland also offered testimony criticizing Monograph 13. Their testimony was neither 
reliable nor persuasive. Called to testify by the United States as an adverse witness, Dr. Whidby admitted that he was a paid 
consultant for Philip Morris and would earn $2,800 per day (total amount $14,000 for five days) for preparing and delivering his 
fact testimony; and that his agreement with Philip Morris obligates him to testify on its behalf in litigation, and does not leave him 
the option of not testifying. Dr. Whidby was repeatedly impeached with prior inconsistent statements during his live examination. In some instances, 
portions of Dr. Whidby's Corrected Written Direct Testimony were in conflict with each other. Whidby WD, 2:5-3:15 (addressing 
consultancy agreement); Whidby TT, 2/22/05, 13942:23-13943:17 (same); Whidby TT, 2/22/05, 13945:23-13947:5 (impeached 
with prior inconsistent testimony relating to whether increased ventilation has an impact on biological activity); Whidby TT, 
2/22/05, 13947:6-13948:10 (impeached with prior inconsistent testimony relating to whether witness had any empirical evidence 
that Marlboro Reds sold today are any less harmful than those sold in 1960); Whidby TT, 2/22/05, 13948:8-13949:18 
(impeached with prior inconsistent testimony on whether witness had any evidence that Philip Morris's general reduction and 
selective reduction techniques have led to one less case of lung cancer in the United States); Whidby TT, 2/22/05, 13952:23-
13954:3 (impeached with prior inconsistent testimony on whether witness had any empirical evidence that Philip Morris's general 
and selective reduction techniques have in fact made its cigarettes less harmful). Defendants offered the testimony of Joseph Mulholland as a fact witness, not as an expert. He is a long-time staff economist 
with the FTC Bureau of Economics, who personally does not agree with the conclusion of Monograph 13 that the introduction of 
low tar cigarettes has not materially reduced health risks from smoking, even though the FTC has never taken an official position 
on this issue. Mulholland WD, 12:12-15, 14:3-6, 15:15-23, 16:3-11 (Monograph 13 has not changed the FTC's position, as the 
FTC has not taken an official position on the issue); Mulholland TT, 4/25/05, 19854:16-19855:3. While recognizing that Dr. 
Mulholland has acquired extensive knowledge, in his capacity as an FTC staff economist, concerning cigarette-related matters, 
as the Court observed at the trial, his ""testimony is not that overwhelmingly relevant."" Mulholland TT, 4/25/05, 19938:16-
19939:1. "

2135,29," In response to the overwhelming weight of scientific authority finding that secondhand smoke is a health risk to both adults 
and children, Defendants called only one expert witness, a statistician, Edwin Bradley. Dr. Bradley's opinion was that ""the 
existing epidemiologic evidence does not demonstrate a valid association between ETS exposure and either lung cancer or 
heart disease."" Bradley WD, 1:17-19. The Court rejects that opinion and finds it not credible for all the following reasons. Dr. Bradley is not a medical doctor, epidemiologist, biologist, or toxicologist. Bradley TT, 3/15/05, 15553:2-23. Dr. Bradley is not 
aware of the components of tobacco smoke or what components might be carcinogens. Id. at 15538:5-15539:19. Dr. Bradley 
has never published on passive smoking; in fact, he has never published on smoking and health generally. He has never been 
the principal investigator on any grant of any kind. (no bates) (JD 025137); Bradley TT, 03/15/05, 15564:19-15566:15, 15568:3-

over $800,000 from the tobacco industry. Bradley WD, 18:14-16. In active smoking cases, Dr. Bradley continues to dispute the overwhelming scientific consensus that smoking causes disease, 
conceding only that smoking ""may"" cause lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema. Bradley TT, 3/15/05, 15559:3-24. Dr. Bradley's ""methodology"" depended on his evaluation of statistical significance. His position was that any epidemiological 
study whose result is not statistically significant must be discarded and cannot be relied upon to determine whether an 
association exists. Dr. Bradley stated: ""If a purported association is not statistically significant, your inquiry can end there."" 
Bradley WD, 25:8-14, 99:1-3; Bradley TT, 03/14/05, 15426:6-9. No scientific or medical authority shares Dr. Bradley's view. Statistical significance is not one of the Surgeon General's criteria 
for causality. As described below, it is a statistician's term of art, a tool to evaluate the possibility of chance in a particular study. 
Dr. Bradley's testimony confirms that even he recognizes this. Bradley WD, 21:19-22:15. Moreover, Dr. Bradley admits that he stands alone in adopting and applying his test. When confronted with the conclusions of Sir 
Richard Peto, Sir Richard Doll, the Surgeon General, the EPA, WHO, IARC, National Research Council, and the American Heart 
Association, Dr. Bradley responded: I didn't say they were wrong. I said that my opinion is that [causation of lung cancer and CHD] has not been established. 
Now they have other judgments [*1952]  and methodologies they used to come to that conclusion. Using my methodology, 
I cannot establish an association. "
2136,," Bradley TT, 03/15/05, 15563:3-15564:4. Dr. Bradley did not testify that he consulted with any scientific or medical authority in 
establishing his causal criteria or reaching his conclusions. The foundation of Dr. Bradley's opinion was his reliance on statistical significance. As already noted, his views are not shared by 
any scientific or medical authority. As a term of art, statistical significance is determined by whether the given confidence interval 
contains the value 1.0. If the interval contains 1.0, there is the possibility that the observed association is due entirely to chance. 
This value for 1.0 is also called the ""null hypothesis."" Bradley TT, 3/14/05, 15427:16-15429:6. In determining statistical 
significance, no other causal evidence is evaluated. Rothman & Greenland's MODERN EPIDEMIOLOGY, identified by Dr. Bradley himself as a leading epidemiological text, 
specifically rejects his position that statistical significance is a bright line test by which to accept or reject results of 
epidemiological studies. Bradley TT, 03/14/05, 15465:8-23. Instead Rothman & Greenland state: Although a single confidence interval can be . . . informative, it is subject to the misinterpretation that values inside the 
interval are all equally compatible with the data, and all values outside it are equally incompatible. The specific level of 
confidence used in constru,cting a confidence interval is arbitrary, however; values of 95% or, less often, 90% are those 
most frequently used. A given confidence interval is but one of an infinite number of ranges nested within one another. 
Points nearer the center of these ranges are more compatible with the data than points further away from the center. (no bates at 191) (JD 003150). Indeed, as Rothman & Greenland emphasize, the point estimate found in a study is always the best answer to what the effect is, 
even if the confidence interval includes 1. Or, stated another way, ""results that are not significant may be compatible with 
substantial effects. Lack of [statistical] significance alone provides no evidence against such effects."" (no bates at 192) (JD 
003150). Rothman & Greenland specifically use active smoking and coronary disease (CHD) and secondhand smoke and lung cancer as 
examples of weak associations that are recognized to be causal: ""Cigarette smoking is not seriously doubted as a cause of 
cardiovascular disease. Another example would be passive smoking and lung cancer, a weak association that few consider to 
be noncausal."" (no bates at 24) (JD 003150). Under questioning, Dr. Bradley admitted that his methodology was in ""fundamental disagreement"" with Rothman & Greenland 
about ""how much weight . . . should be given to the factor of statistical significance."" Bradley also admitted that under the 
recognized methodology of Rothman & Greenland, secondhand smoke studies whose confidence intervals include 1, and are 
therefore not statistically significant as a technical matter, are nonetheless more compatible with a positive association. Bradley 
TT, 3/15/05, 15548:22-15549:8, 15546:9-15. Dr. Bradley chose to limit his analysis to epidemiological studies from the United States. In so doing, he arbitrarily eliminated all 
foreign studies, whether statistically significant or not, including the Hirayama and Trichopoulos studies. Bradley WD, 55:4-60:6. "
2150,30," Defendants claim that these statements are protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. That is a legal issue which is 
resolved in the Conclusions of Law, herein. "
2167,31," At trial, Eisenberg, the director of CIAR, denied that CIAR sponsored the Liao/Hong Kong study at all. Eisenberg TT, 11/9/04, 
5568:27-5569:3. The Court does not credit this testimony. "
2174,32, The Court is not making a finding that all paid industry consultants lied or gave testimony that they knew to be false. 
2191,33," In 1991, Kraft General Foods, a subsidiary of Philip Morris Companies (now Altria), continued the Philip Morris support of 
AHF. That year, Kraft gave AHF $657,500 toward its five year commitment of nearly $2 million for a research and education 
program to be conducted from 1991 to 1995. This program studied the correlation between lifestyle and environmental 
exposures and major chronic illnesses, and the role of diet in cancers of the lung, oral cavity and bladder. 2046988683-8683 (US

2207,34," According to a December 21, 1993 memorandum from CECCM Chairman John Lepere to Philip Morris's David Bushong and 
Matt Winokur, Lepere addressed a Philip Morris recommendation that consultants in the future disclose CECCM funding. Lepere 
responded: I consider that future decisions on disclosure would best be made, taking account of your company's recommendation, on a 
case by case basis as each arises . . . . The only recent project to which the recommendation would have been relevant in J.C. Luik's ""Pandora's Box"" project. 
Although the decision was not recorded in the minutes of the meeting of our Working Group held on 9 June 1993, the 
Group then decided, without dissent, that credit should not be given to CECCM in any publication resulting from that 
project. I confirmed accordingly to John Luik in writing on the following day. He submitted his paper shortly thereafter for 
peer-review for publication in the ""Philosophy and Public Affairs"" learned journal and it has also recently been part-
published in the Bostonia magazine, in both cases without acknowledgment of CECCM's financial support."

2216,35," While Defendants told the Court that they intended to produce Dr. DiMarco to explain these events, and he was on the 
defense witness list, Juchatz TT, 11/18/04, 6618:21-6619:8, Defendants did not call Dr. DiMarco."
2216,36," BATAS was formerly known as W.D. & H.O. Wills (Australia) Limited (""Wills""). ""Prior to August 23, 1999, BATCo, through 
intermediate holding companies, held approximately 67% of the shares of W.D. & H.O. Wills Holdings Limited (""Wills""). The

2226,37," Section 128 Privilege in respect to self-incrimination in other proceedings states: (1) This section applies [*2253]  if a witness objects to giving particular evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend 
to prove that the witness: (a) has committed an offense against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country; or (b) is liable to a civil penalty. (2) Subject to subsection (5), if the court finds that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is not to require 
the witness to give that particular evidence, and is to inform the witness: (a) that he or she need not give the evidence; and (b) that, if he or she gives the evidence, the court will give a certificate under this section; and (c) of the effect of such a certificate. (3) If the witness gives the evidence, the court is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect 
of the evidence. (4) The court is also to cause a witness to be given a certificate under this section if: (a) the objection has been overruled; and (b) after the evidence has been given, the court finds that there were reasonable grounds for the objection. (5) If the court is satisfied that: (a) the evidence concerned may tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or 
is liable to a civil penalty [*2254]  under, an Australian law; and "
2227,," (b) the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable 
to a civil penalty under, a law of a foreign country; and (c) the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence; the court may require the witness to give the 
evidence. (6) If the court so requires, it is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the 
evidence. (7) In any proceeding in an Australian court: (a) evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given; and (b) evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequences of the person having 
given evidence; cannot be used against the person. However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect 
of the falsity of the evidence. (8) In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence 
that the defendant; (a) did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue; or (b) had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue. (9) A reference in this section to doing an act includes [*2255]  a reference to failing to act."
2227,38," The orders of the Australian Court were rendered in open court and are recorded as separate volumes of the Cannar Trial 
Transcript. They have also been assigned US Exhibit numbers. "
2228,39," In the Memorandum Opinion accompanying Order #896, issued March 14, 2005, the McCabe decision was discussed at 
length. At p. 3 of that Opinion, the Court ruled, as it had on a number of previous occasions, that ""a court opinion is a public 
document of which it can take judicial notice, and therefore need not and will not be admitted into evidence."" Consequently, the 
McCabe opinion was not admitted as an exhibit, although the Court took judicial notice of it. In addition, it is important to reiterate the manner in which the Opinion spelled out the use which could be made of the McCabe 
opinion. Opinion #896 examined Australian law at some length, including the appellate decision reversing McCabe (see BATAS 
v. Cowell, [2003] VSCA 43 (V.S. Ct. - Ct. App. Apr. 28, 2002) (Austl.) (""Cowell II""), and concluded, at p. 9, that ""any portions of 
those documents quoted in the McCabe opinion may be used by strangers to the litigation in any way they see fit. Defendants 
cite no case law to the contrary, nor has this Court found any."" The Court also concluded, at p. 10, that ""neither BATCo nor 
BATAS made the requisite zealous effort to guard the confidentiality of the contents"" of the McCabe opinion and had, 
consequently, waived their privilege. "
2229,," In particular, the Government was ""not precluded from eliciting testimony from Mr. Gulson about publicly available portions of the 
McCabe opinion. . . . Mr. Gulson may offer testimony as to his personal knowledge about events or documents quoted in the 
McCabe opinion, including events relating to the creation of the Foyle Memorandum. He may testify whether he thinks or 
believes that the McCabe quotes from the Foyle Memorandum are accurate or are consistent with his memory. However, he 
cannot reveal anything that was in the Foyle Memorandum that is not directly quoted in the McCabe opinion."" Op. and Order 
#896 at p. 14. All of Mr. Gulson's testimony which is relied upon in these Findings of Fact falls within the parameters set forth in 
Op. and Order #896. "
2234,40," John Welch, CEO of the Tobacco Institute of Australia (the Australian counterpart of the Defendant Tobacco Institute) from 
1991 to 1992 also gave testimony that the TIA member companies destroyed potentially damaging documents, including in 
particular scientific studies, so as to keep those documents ""out of litigation and out of the hands of those that could use the 
information to attack the industry."" Welch WD, 9:5-16, 11:15-12:8. The TIA ""member companies"" included the Australian 
affiliates of BATCo, B&W, Reynolds and Philip Morris. Id. at 4:10-4:14. Because Welch's testimony was internally inconsistent, 
as well as inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, it cannot be credited and is not relied upon. "
2237,41," The Court would note that on April 14, 2004, more than a year before this case went to trial, Special Master Levie found that 
the Government had established a prima facie showing that the crime fraud exception applied, and therefore overcame BATCo's 
claims of attorney-client privilege and/or work product protection for the Foyle Memorandum. He recommended that the Court 
order BATCo to produce a copy of the Foyle Memorandum to the Government within two days. R&R #155. While the subsequent history of R&R #155 is fairly tangled, and involved several trips to the Court of Appeals, this Court did not 
reach the central substantive issue -- whether the Government had established the crime fraud exception. With the benefit of 
hindsight, and on the strength of fully cross-examined, in-person testimony from several key witnesses for the Government (a 
luxury which the Special Master did not have), the Court concludes that the Special Master's ruling in this regard was eminently 
correct. "
2242,42," The crime-fraud exception to a finding of privilege overcomes the privilege if it was employed in furtherance of the planning or 
commission of a crime or fraud. United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 109 S. Ct. 2619, 105 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1989). "
2244,7," While it would appear, although it is not perfectly clear, that Defendant BATAS has not yet had an opportunity to present 
evidence and argument against application of the Australian crime-fraud exception to the privileged documents in issue, Mr. 
Gulson was fully cross-examined by BATAS and his testimony was credited by that Court. Id. at ¶ 51, 52. "
2247,8, The payment is subject to certain adjustments based on changes in the market. 
2250,9," On June 6, 2006, the CDC issued a Report finding that the decline in youth smoking rates which began in 1998 plateaued 
because teenage smoking initiation is on the rise again. However, this Report is not part of the record in this case. The Court is 
not relying upon this information. "
2254,10," The Government presented this case as one overarching scheme based upon seven pillars. The Court is not bound by the 
Government's conceptual analysis and did not find it the most useful approach. "
2256,11," The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 1-3, 5, 7, 10-
14, 18, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34, 38, 42, 43, 46, 50, 51, 54, 57, 62, 64, 65, 82, 85, 92, 99, 105-107, 115, 120, & 123. "
2257,12," The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 15, 25, 30, 56, 
58, 60, 63, 71, 72, 74, 75, 79, 81, 103, 104, 109, 110, 114, 116, 132, & 133."
2257,13," Indeed, to this day none of Defendant cigarette manufacturers publicly admit that nicotine is an addictive drug delivered in 
cigarettes. Defendants' current public statements on addiction avoid any mention of nicotine, let alone its role in addiction. See 
Findings of Fact Section V(B)(4)(j). Dr. Jack Henningfield and Dr. Michael Eriksen both testified that Defendants' current 
statements about addiction omit material information and are not fully consistent with the conclusions of the medical and 
scientific communities. Henningfield WD, 104:23-109:22; Eriksen TT, 5/16/05, 21248:20-21249:15. "
2258,14," ""Physical dependence"" and ""withdrawal"" are generally considered equivalent concepts. The occurrence of withdrawal 
symptoms upon removal of the dependence-producing agent is the marker for physical dependence. Rowell TT, 3/23/05,

2259,15, The Racketeering Acts associated with this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 109-113 
2260,16," The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this claimed scheme are Racketeering Act Nos. 36, 37, 39, 47, 48, 53, 119 & 124. "
2261,17," The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 4, 6, 35, 49, 61, 
76, 83, 84, 86, 87, 89, 91, 93, 94, 96, 97, 100, 102, 117, 118, 121, 122, 125-131, 134-148. "
2263,18," Although it is not in the record because it was issued this year, and accordingly, the Court does not rely upon it, the 2006 
Surgeon General Report, titled ""The Health and Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke,"" contains 
noteworthy conclusions, which are entirely consistent with these Findings. In particular, the Surgeon General found ""there is no 
risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke."" Office on Smoking and Health, U.S. Dept. Of Health and Human Servs., The 
Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon Gen. — Executive Summary 9 
(2006). Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of a child being born at a low birth weight, increase the risk of 
sudden infant death syndrome, and cause acute respiratory infections and conditions in children as well as adults. Id. at 9, 11, 
12. Secondhand smoke also adversely affects the cardiovascular system, and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer.

2265,19," The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this claimed scheme are Racketeering Act Nos. 11, 19, 20, 21, 28, 41, 58, 63, 71, 
72, 74, 75, 103 and 108. "
2268,20," Despite the apparent conflict of interest, a few law firms, particularly Covington & Burling and Shook, Hardy & Bacon, 
represented the shared interests of all the Defendants and coordinated a significant part of the Enterprise's activities."
2268,21," For purposes of this lawsuit, the Enterprise was in existence as early as December 1953. No evidence was presented about 
the Enterprise prior to 1953. "
2274,22," Altria argues that there is no legal justification for piercing its corporate veil. However, Defendant's argument misses the point. 
The United States does not seek to pierce Altria's corporate veil or to hold Altria liable under some form of agency theory. 
Rather, the Court holds that Altria is liable for its own violations of RICO and its participation in the Enterprise, in part due to its 
control of Philip Morris policies, research, and public statements and, in part, due to its own individual actions. Altria is itself party 
to the scheme to defraud consumers by denying the health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of nicotine, the manipulation of 
nicotine delivery from cigarettes, the hazards of secondhand smoke, and marketing to youth. "
2276,23," Prior to 1974, the United States Mail was virtually the only means of authorized postal delivery in the United States. See Air 
Courier Conference of America v. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 519, 111 S. Ct. 913, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1125 
(1991); O'Brien, 644 F. Supp. at 142. Moreover, effective September 13, 1994, Congress amended the mail fraud statute to 
attach liability to anyone who in furtherance of a scheme to defraud, ""deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing 
whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier."" Pub. L. No. 102-322 (codified as amended at 
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (1994)). See also In re clerkship of Sabita Soneji, 128 F. Supp. 2d 1287 (D.D.C. 2004-2006). "
2277,24," The Court attempted to be very certain about the Racketeering Acts to which Defendants have stipulated or admitted the 
""causing"" requirement, but it proved impossible. Both the Government's and Defendants' papers on this issue are unclear and at 
times inconsistent. For example, the Government states in its July 1, 2004 Proposed Conclusions of Law that Defendants' 
stipulations and admissions on the ""causing"" requirement include Racketeering Acts 68, 115, 118, 124, 125, 127, 129, and 144. 
However, in its Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact, those Racketeering Acts are not included in the list of stipulations and 
admissions on ""causing."" With no guidance from the parties, the Court is left to guess. "
2279,25," Furthermore, it is important to note that 18 U.S.C. § 1341 proscribes not only sending the communication in furtherance of the 
scheme to defraud, but also receiving the communication. See, e.g., United States v. Coyle, 943 F.2d 424, 425 (4th Cir. 1991). 
For instance, as detailed in Racketeering Act 17, CTR mailed a communication to Liggett, Philip Morris, Reynolds, Brown & 
Williamson, and Lorillard. In addition to the cigarette company Defendants'""causing"" CTR to send the mailing, they (as members 
of the scheme to defraud) are liable for receiving it. "
2280,26," See Racketeering Acts 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49, 56, 66, 67, 70, 
73, 77, 79, 81, 87, 88, 91, 93, 98, 117, 118, 120, 130, 132, and 133."
2280,27," The Government has argued that Defendants are liable for CTR and TI's racketeering acts as aiders and abettors under 18 
U.S.C. § 2(a) (""[w]hoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or 
procures its commission, is punishable as a principal""). However, because the Court finds Defendants caused CTR and TI's 
mailings on other grounds, it need not reach that issue."
2280,28," In particular, Defendants single out the testimony of their CEOs at the Waxman hearings and a May, 1994 letter from Phillip 
Morris to Rep. Waxman expressing the view that nicotine is not addictive, to show that Defendants were primarily engaged in 
influencing governmental action. Defs. Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 82, 87. "

a redress of grievances."" U.S. Const. Amend. 1."
2281,30," Noerr-Pennington immunity is not absolute. It allows a ""sham"" exception for ""situations in which persons use the governmental 
process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as a . . . weapon. A classic example is the filing of frivolous objections to 
the license application of a competitor, with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose 
expense and delay."" City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. 365, 380, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 
(1991) (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted)."
2281,31," See Falise, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 351-352, where plaintiffs alleged that defendant tobacco manufacturers had historically invested 
RICO racketeering funds in a ""scorched earth litigation strategy"" designed to intimidate them into not suing defendants. 
Defendants had argued that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunized their earlier litigation strategies. The Falise court held that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine did not apply because the challenged conduct had nothing to do with 
petitioning. ""Defendants, having been hailed into court in the earlier litigation, were clearly not exercising their right to petition the 
government."" Instead, Defendants' right to utilize the tools of the adversarial process ""invoke[d] issues of procedural due process 
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, rather than the First Amendment right to petition the government."" Id. "
2282,32," Fraudulent statements are entitled to a lesser level of protection than other speech because ""the intentional lie [does not] 
materially advance society's interest in uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate on public issues."" Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 
418 U.S. 323, 340, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974)."
2282,33," As this Court previously stated, ""the standard of proof required to show that speech is fraudulent . . . is a thorny issue,"" where 
case law is not settled. Mem. Op. To Order #624 at 3 n.1. The Court need not decide this issue here because there is ample 
proof of Defendants' fraud under any standard that could be applied. The Government's evidence is sufficient to satisfy both a 
preponderance of the evidence standard and a clear and convincing evidence standard. Accordingly, the Court finds it 
unnecessary to make a broad statement concerning which standard of proof is required in cases involving alleged intentionally 
fraudulent statements. "
2288,34," Defendants try to read into this brief footnote more than is warranted. In light of the complexity and confusion in the law on this 
issue, it is hard to believe that this somewhat Delphic footnote will bear the weight which Defendants place on it. "
2290,35," It is noteworthy that cases involving the FTC's determinations of materiality are consistent with the Court's finding here, even 
though such cases are brought pursuant to the FTC Act rather than the RICO statute. As a general rule, deceptive advertising or 
claims permit an inference ""that the deception will constitute a material factor in a purchaser's decision to buy."" FTC v. Colgate-
Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 391-92, 85 S. Ct. 1035, 13 L. Ed. 2d 904 (1965); see also FTC v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 778 F.2d 35, 40-43, 250 U.S. App. D.C. 162 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that deceptive advertising touting Defendants' low 
tar cigarettes created an ""inherent tendency to deceive"" consumers and was material); FTC v. Wilcox, 926 F. Supp. 1091, 1098 
(S.D. Fla. 1995) (""Express claims or deliberately-made implied claims used to induce the purchase of a particular product or 
service are presumed to be material""). Moreover, materiality is presumed for matters that ""significantly involve health, safety, or 
other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned."" Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 223 F.3d 783, 786, 343 U.S. App. 
D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Deception Statement, 103 FTC at 182); see also Kraft, Inc. v. FTC, 970 F.2d 311, 322 (7th 
Cir. 1992). "
2291,36," Defendants also may not escape liability for their scheme to defraud by claiming that the public was not injured by their 
misconduct. To establish a mail or wire fraud violation, a plaintiff is not required to prove that: (1) the wrongdoer succeeded in 
deceiving or defrauding the intended victim; (2) the victim suffered any loss of money, property, or other harm; or (3) the 
intended victim detrimentally relied upon the wrongdoer's fraudulent misconduct. See Philip Morris, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 69-70; 
Philip Morris, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 153; Philip Morris, 273 F. Supp. 2d at 6. Thus, ""the common-law requirements of justifiable 
reliance and damages . . . plainly have no place in the federal statutes."" Neder, 527 U.S. at 24-25. "
2292,37," Before trial in this case, Defendants raised a number of affirmative defenses. The Court granted the Government's Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment for these defenses as to liability. See Order #476; see also Order #227, #356, #509, #538, and 
#586. However, at that time the Court reserved judgment about how these affirmative defenses might apply to remedies. See 
Mem. Op. to Order #476 at 27 n.21. Defendants now appropriately raise the same affirmative defenses in regard to remedies. Repeating the arguments from their pre-trial brief, Defendants again assert that waiver, laches, unclean hands, in pari delicto, 
and equitable estoppel bar any claim for relief by the Government. See Defs.'Post-Trial Br. on Affirmative Defenses 18, Sept. 7, 
2005. As in the pre-trial brief on affirmative defenses, Defendants' make the broad argument that because the Federal Trade 
Commission has had an historical role regulating tobacco products, the Court cannot grant the Government any relief in this 
action. See Defs.' Post-Trial Reply Br. in Support of Their Affirmative Defenses 1, Sept. 29, 2005. In previously rejecting this 
theory and Defendants' affirmative defenses in regards to liabilities, this Court found that, ""the case law overwhelmingly supports 
the Government's position"" that the enumerated equitable defenses may not be asserted against the United States ""when, as 
here, 'it is acting in its sovereign capacity to exercise public rights to protect the public interest.'"" United States v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., 300 F. Supp. 2d 65-66 (D.D.C. 2004) (internal citations omitted). Significantly, the facts have not changed since Defendants asked this Court to rule on affirmative defenses in the liability stage 
of this matter. Furthermore, Defendants have not put forth any new arguments or cited any new precedent for why the Court 
should rule in favor of the affirmative defenses they now re-raise as to remedies. Therefore, this Court finds that the affirmative 
defenses now re-raised by Defendants as to remedies do not preclude the United States from obtaining relief."
2292,38," The first two elements are also required to establish the substantive RICO violation, which has been addressed supra, in 
Sections VII(C) and (D). "
2294,39," As discussed in great detail, infra at Section VIII(C), Liggett withdrew from the conspiracy in 1997. Accordingly, Liggett is not 
liable as a conspirator for any acts that occurred subsequent to 1997. "
2295,40," As noted earlier, no evidence has been presented regarding a conspiracy before 1953. "
2296,41," Contrary to Altria's claim, the prohibition against intracorporate conspiracies under the antitrust laws does not apply to this 
case. In Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), the Seventh Circuit explained: Since a subsidiary and its parent theoretically have a community of interest, a conspiracy [*2475]  ""in restraint of trade"" 
between them poses no threat to the goals of antitrust law — protecting competition. In contrast, intracorporate 
conspiracies do threaten RICO's goals of preventing the infiltration of legitimate businesses by racketeers and separating 
racketeers from their profits."
2296,875," F.2d at 1281 (citations omitted). Accordingly, because Altria conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. §1962(c), it is liable under RICO 
conspiracy, even though one of the Defendants with which Altria conspired was Philip Morris USA, Altria's subsidiary. "
2297,42," Withdrawal does not preclude liability even in criminal prosecutions involving substantive mail and wire fraud offenses. For 
example, in United States v. Read, 658 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1981), the Seventh Circuit explained the differences between the 
application of the withdrawal defense to substantive, as opposed to conspiracy, offenses. In holding that withdrawal was not a 
defense to substantive mail and securities fraud offenses, the court explained, ""A party's 'withdrawal' from a scheme is [] no 
defense to the crime because membership in the scheme is not an element of the offense. [The defendant] is liable for mail 
fraud as a principal or as an aider and abettor, not a conspirator."" Id. at 1240; accord United States v. Waldrop, 786 F.Supp. 
1194, 1201 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (""withdrawal is no defense to mail fraud""), aff'd, 983 F.2d 1054 (3d Cir. 1992) (Table). Accordingly, 
Liggett's withdrawal from the RICO conspiracy does not preclude its liability under 18 U.S.C. §1962(c) for the substantive mail 
and wire fraud offenses that underlie the civil RICO lawsuit for equitable relief brought by the United States. "
2299,43," See, e.g., United States v. Private Sanitation Indus. Ass'n, 995 F.2d 375, 377 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Local 30, United 
Slate, Tile & Composition Workers, 871 F.2d 401, 408-09 (3d Cir. 1989); United States v. Local 1804-1, Int'l Longshoremens 
Ass'n, 831 F. Supp. 177, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); United States v. Local 295, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 784 F. Supp. 15, 19-22 
(E.D.N.Y. 1992) (RICO injunction granted based upon evidence of past corruptions, and the court noted that ""[i]nstitutional 
practices and traditions tend to endure long after specific individuals are gone"") (id. at 19); Local 6A, 663 F. Supp. at 194-95. "
2300,44," Schindler acknowledged at trial that ""[i]f R.J. Reynolds wanted to convey the message on its Website that smoking causes 
disease, it could say that unequivocally,"" and that he could make it happen ""in a heartbeat,"" but he would not do so. Schindler 
TT, 1/24/05, 10816:25-10817:5, 10821:2-18."
2300,45," From 1999-2001, the Philip Morris website publicly stated its disagreement with the scientific consensus as well: Many scientists and regulators have concluded that ETS poses a health risk to nonsmokers. Even though we do not agree 
with many of their conclusions, below we have provided some links so you can access some of their views. (no bates) (US 92056 at 2); Parrish TT, 11080:23-11082:14. While this case was pending, Philip Morris revised its position on ETS to delete its disagreement with the conclusions of 
""scientists and regulators."" Philip Morris now states: ""Public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke from 
cigarettes causes disease, including lung cancer and heart disease in nonsmoking adults"" as well as a number of adverse health 
effects in children. (no bates) (US 92055 at 1). "
2302,46," A defendant seeking to escape a permanent injunction bears the burden of demonstrating that ""subsequent events made it 
absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur."" United States v. Concentrated 
Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) (emphasis added); United States v. W.T. 
Grant Co., 345U.S. 629, 632 (1953). "
2303,47," In an effort to demonstrate that it is not reasonably likely to violate RICO in the United States in the future, BATCo argues that 
it conducts no business in the United States and that it is unlikely to have anything more than ""incidental"" contact with tobacco 
manufacturers in the United States. JD Br. at 126-127. In addition to the fact that future action within the United States is not 
required, each of these assertions is inaccurate. First, BATCo conducts business in the United States through an agreement 
with Lane Limited (which is now owned by Reynolds American, Inc.), which sells and markets millions of BATCo's State Express 
555 brand cigarettes in the United States. (no bates) (US 77453). Second, BATCo continues to participate with other Defendants 
in international organizations that play an important role in the operation of the Enterprise, such as Tobacco Mfrs. Association 
and CECCM. Third, BATCo remains closely affiliated with Reynolds American, Inc., the parent company of R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. See JD FF Chap. 12, § IV.D.1. ¶¶ 338, 343, 345. In light of BATCo's 
extensive participation in the Enterprise's violations of 1962(c) and (d) and the ongoing activities described here, the Court finds 
BATCo's arguments on its reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations wholly unpersuasive. "
2306,48," Liggett today is the fifth largest producer of cigarettes in the United States. LeBow WD, 11. "
2307,49," Moreover, because Liggett engages in virtually no consumer advertising, there is little opportunity for it to influence smoker 
beliefs concerning low-tar cigarettes. See JD Final Proposed Findings of Fact."
2307,50," Recently, the Tenth Circuit, without expressing an ""opinion regarding whether, or in what circumstances, disgorgement is 
authorized under RICO"" held that the presence of the term ""restrain"" in a statutory grant of general equity jurisdiction is not 
dispositive evidence of Congress's intent to limit remedies to those that are forward-looking."" United States v. Rx Depot, Inc., "
2308,438," F.3d 1052, 1058-1059 (10th Cir. 2006) (declining to apply the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the term ""restrain"" and 
upholding the Supreme Court interpretation permitting disgorgement as a forward-looking remedy in cases brought under § 
332(a) of the FDCA). Rx Depot followed virtually the same analysis of a court's equitable powers to ""restrain"" violations as this 
Court did in Order #550, relying heavily on Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S. Ct. 1086, 90 L. Ed. 1332 
(1946) and concluding that disgorgement is allowed under the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which states that ""district 
courts . . . shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown to restrain violations."" Id."
2308,51," This determination has created a Circuit split. Contrary to the D.C. Circuit, both the Fifth and Second Circuits have adopted a 
standard of relief that permits disgorgement where it will prevent and restrain future RICO violations. As the Second Circuit 
reasoned, disgorgement may serve the goal of preventing and restraining future violations where ""there is a finding that the 
gains are being used to fund or promote the illegal conduct, or constitute capital for that purpose."" United States v. Carson, 52 
F.3d 1173, 1182 (2nd Cir. 1995); see also Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, 355 F.3d 345, 354-355 (5th Cir. 2003) 
(adopting the standard set forth by the Second Circuit but denying disgorgement on other grounds). "
2311,52," Defendants claim that prohibition of their deceptive use of descriptors ""would improperly invade the primary jurisdiction of the 
FTC,"" JD PFOF, ch. 13 ¶ 599, but ""[t]he FTC does not impose, regulate, or require [descriptors]. How those terms are applied, 
and on which brands, is entirely up to the tobacco companies."" Henningfield WD, 56:8-11. Further, Defendants' claim reiterates 
their previous argument that such relief is preempted by the FTC Act, an argument which the Court has already rejected. See 
United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 2d 72, 74 (D.D.C. 2003). "
2314,53," Defendants' argument that requiring corrective statements on package onserts would conflict with the Federal Cigarette 
Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq. (""FCLAA"") is unconvincing. This remedy falls within the narrow scope of 
equitable powers granted to the Court under Section 1964(a) because it specifically prevents and restrains Defendants from 
continuing to make statements about smoking and health that are fraudulent and misleading in vehicles which are likely to reach 
consumers. It does not implicate Section 5(a) of the FCLAA, because Section 5(a) only prohibits ""state and federal rulemaking 
bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements"" on cigarette packages. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 
518, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992). Under the FCLAA, a ""package"" is defined as ""a pack, box, carton, or container 
of any kind in which cigarettes are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers."" 15 U.S.C. § 1332 (4). An onsert, 
which is only a small informational brochure attached to the outside of the ""pack box, carton, or container . . . in which cigarettes 
are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers,"" is not a package. Therefore, the remedy at issue does not 
implicate the FCLAA's preemption provision. "
2317,54," Disaggregated data is data broken down by type of marketing, brand, geographical region, number of cigarettes sold, 
advertising in stores, and any other category of data collected and/or maintained by or on behalf of each Defendant regarding 
their cigarette marketing efforts."
2317,55," The Government has also requested a specific injunction against Defendants' ongoing and future youth marketing. Although 
such a remedy would certainly serve the public interest, it does not prevent and restrain future RICO violations, which, in this 
case, are not Defendants' continuing efforts to market to youth but rather their false denials of those efforts. Accordingly, 
because this injunction does not meet the standard set forth in Judge Sentelle's Opinion, the Court cannot enter such a remedy. "
2318,56," Dr. Gruber based his youth smoking reduction targets on the 1997 Proposed Resolution, a draft settlement proposed by 
certain Defendants to Congress when it was considering federal regulation of the tobacco industry and resolution of all pending 
tobacco lawsuits. As Defendants vigorously argue, because the 1997 Resolution was never adopted and was merely part of a 
comprehensive settlement package, it would not be an appropriate basis for setting targets for reductions in youth smoking. In addition, Dr. Gruber proposed, as one possible means for decreasing youth smoking rates, that Defendants use price 
increases alone to effectuate the necessary reductions. Dr. Gruber did note that Defendants have at their disposal many other 
tools by which they could choose to achieve the targets, but that price increases alone could yield the same result, if Defendants 
chose to take that course. In response, Defendants raised the concern that, with price increases, they would lose some market "
2319,," share (however minimal) to tobacco manufacturers who are party to neither this Order nor the MSA. As a result, those 
manufacturers could market to youth without any restrictions and thus undermine the very purpose of Dr. Gruber's proposal. This 
effect, if it occurred, would be of concern. "
2320,57," As is obvious, the Court is not entering as remedies either the proposed national smoker cessation program or the proposed 
public education and countermarketing campaign. Accordingly, Joint Defendants' Motion for Judgment on Partial Findings 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) with Respect to Certain Remedies Sought by the United States is denied as moot. "
2321,58," Rule 54(d) of the FRCP states: ""Except when express provisions therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in 
these rules, costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise 
directs."" "
2331,59, All information obtained from http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/sgr/index.htm 
2366,1," This reflects the rates the court found appropriate in its Order Granting Hynix's Motion for a New Trial on the Issue of Damages 
Unless Rambus Elects Remittitur of the Jury Award. "
2367,2," The court recognizes that Infineon could still be in an advantageous position given its settlement with Rambus following the 
dismissal of Rambus's claims against it based upon unclean hands (spoliation of evidence). "
2368,3, Hynix also asserts that collateral estoppel applies as to its equitable estoppel defense on the same grounds.
2368,4," Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act was codified as 15 U.S.C. § 16(a). In this order references to Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act 
and 15 U.S.C. § 16(a) are used interchangeably. "
2369,5," Congress went on to state that the bill (H.R. 4046) ""amends that provision to provide that the statute shall not be construed to 
preclude the application of the common law doctrine of collateral estoppel in a subsequent proceeding."" H. Rep. No. 96-874, *3 
(1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2752, 2753). There is no indication that the amendments change or restrict the original grant of prima facie 
effect in 1914."
2369,6," It is not disputed that either the FTC or the Justice Department may enforce the antitrust laws. See 
http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/antitrust.htm. (""The antitrust laws are enforced by both the FTC's Bureau of Competition and the Antitrust 
Division of the Department of Justice. In order to prevent duplication of effort, the two agencies consult before opening any case. 
All criminal antitrust enforcement is handled by the Antitrust Division."")."
2369,7," Neither the cases cited by the parties nor the additional case law considered by the court addressed the precise issue of the 
prima facie effect of explicit findings of violation of the antitrust laws, (see, e.g., FTC Opn., p. 27), in a Federal Trade 
Commission proceeding where the complaint was brought pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. See also 
Concurring Opinion of Commissioner Leibowitz at p. 1, which observed that the Commission found that Rambus's conduct met 
all of the requisite elements of a Section 2 violation, and that the Complaint Counsel did not litigate the matter as a pure Federal 
Trade Commission Act Section 5 violation. "
2370,8," As noted above, this reflects the rates the court found appropriate in its Order Granting Hynix's Motion for a New Trial on the 
Issue of Damages Unless Rambus Elects Remittitur of the Jury Award. "
