31,1," Plaintiff also argues that its claims are not barred by the statute of limitations because of the continuing violation doctrine.HN7[ ]  ""Antitrust law provides that, in the case of a continuing violation, say a price fixing conspiracy that brings about a series of unlawfully high priced sales over a period of years, each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff, e.g., 
each sale to the plaintiff, starts the statutory period running again, regardless of the plaintiff's knowledge of the alleged illegality 
at much earlier times."" Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 189, 117 S. Ct. 1984, 138 L. Ed. 2d 373 (U.S. 1997). Plaintiff 
claims that it is suffering a continuing violation because defendants ""continue to conspire"" and continue ""to claim ownership"" of 
ETBW, and that the defendants ""continue to profit"" from ETBW. (plf. response to def. motion at 6). However, because we find, 
as discussed below, that none of these alleged actions constitutes an antitrust violation, we find that the continuing violation 
doctrine does not apply to these facts. "
33,2," We note that though plaintiff has survived the statute of limitations at the pleading stage, its likelihood of survival past this point 
is remote."
33,3," Plaintiff claims that its failure to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity should not prove fatal to its claim. Plaintiff relies 
on Fine v. Jansen, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21991, 1986 WL 8731 (N.D. Ill. 1986), for this proposition. In Fine, the court held that a 
plaintiff alleging corporate fraud could survive a motion to dismiss, where the plaintiff made a number of the fraud allegations 
upon information and belief. The court reasoned that in situations such as this, where most of the information necessary will be 
in the hands of the defendants, the plaintiff cannot be required to know all the details of the alleged fraudulent scheme. The court 
found that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts within its knowledge to support the fraud claim, and therefore, the pleading of 
the specifics of the scheme upon information and belief was sufficient to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. That 
case is inapposite here. Plaintiff here has not alleged any of the facts deemed to be within its knowledge, nor has it alleged any 
of the specifics of the fraudulent concealment scheme, upon information or belief, or otherwise. Therefore, plaintiff's claim must 
fail. "
34,4," Again we note, as above, that plaintiff's chances of survival beyond the pleading stage are remote, based on these allegations. "
35,5," Plaintiff extracts this statement from a portion of the complaint introducing the parties generally, and does not reference this act 
anywhere in its claims. "
36,6," In para. 21 of plaintiff's third amended complaint it notes that five radio stations were involved in the planning of the black expo, 
two of which allegedly belonged to defendants. Plaintiff does not allege that these five stations are the only ones in the Chicago 
metropolitan area with heavy African-American listenership, nor allege misconduct by defendants' other radio station not a party 
to this action."
36,7," At one point plaintiff's complaint alleges that defendant Merry Green and MGPG ""continue to count WVAZ and [ETBW] as 
clients,"" but three paragraphs later states that ""Merry Green continues to conspire with WVAZ and the Clear Channel 
Defendants to claim ownership of [ETBW]."""
36,8," We have found no cases that hold that using one party's resources to promote a joint venture constitutes anti-competitive 
conduct or an antitrust violation. However, even if such conduct was considered anti-competitive, at most it would be evaluated 
under the rule-of-reason standard. See Car Carriers, 745 F.2d at 1108. HN24[
] This standard contains a threshold 
requirement where plaintiff must first show defendants' market power. Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers. Ltd., 822 F.2d 
656, 666 (7th Cir. 1987). If plaintiff fails to do so, as plaintiff here has, then the inquiry is ended. Id. "
37,9," Plaintiff claims, in its response to defendants' motion to dismiss, that it has sufficiently alleged an antitrust violation, and that it 
has consistently alleged that Clear Channel and its radio stations fixed prices and interfered with sponsorships in order to make 
non-Clear Channel expos unappealing to vendors, sponsors and consumers. We first note that a complaint may not be 
amended by the brief in opposition of the motion to dismiss. Car Carriers, 745 F.2d at 1107. However, even if we were to look at 
these statements as being consistent with the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint, none of plaintiff's allegations is evidence 
of price-fixing. At most, plaintiff has alleged price discrimination, an allegation that falls under the Robertson-Patman Act, which 
we discuss below. "
46,1," The manufacturing parties are Defendants Thomas Mosey, Dots of Fun, International Laser Expressions, Inc., Nicholas Angus, 
and Frosty Bites, Inc. (now known as Mini Melts, Inc.). Defendant Frosty Bites Distribution, its various local affiliates, and 
individuals such as founder Victor Bauer are the distributing parties. The issues in this case are not generally resolved in a 
manner unique to particular defendants, so we refer collectively to ""the defendants"" where appropriate."
46,2," The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to claims of trade dress infringement, id. at 
1374-75, and trade secret violations, id. at 1376. It granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on a minor contract issue. Id. at 
1378. These issues are not before us on appeal. The trade dress issue was appealed separately to the Eleventh Circuit, which 
affirmed. Dippin' Dots, Inc. v. Frosty Bites Distrib., 369 F.3d 1197 (11th Cir. 2004). "
47,3," As described supra, the claim construction and summary judgment phases of this litigation were handled by the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. ""The district court"" as used in this section refers to that court. "
50,4," The district court characterized DDI's intent to deceive as ""of a high nature."" We disagree, but believe that in light of the high 
materiality of the nondisclosure, inequitable conduct can still be found here even though the evidence reveals less than an 
egregriously willful intent to deceive. "
51,5," Here that defendant is the plaintiff DDI, which is defending against a Walker Process counterclaim."
51,6," Unitherm applied Tenth Circuit antitrust law. Id. (citing United States v. AMR Corp., 335 F.3d 1109, 1113 (10th Cir. 2003); 
Telecor Communs., Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 305 F.3d 1124, 1130-31 (10th Cir. 2002)). Fifth Circuit law also requires 
proof of a relevant market. Doctor's Hosp. v. Se. Med. Alliance, 123 F.3d 301, 311 (5th Cir. 1997). "
52,7," Defendants move to strike the portions of DDI's amended brief which argue that the fee awards should be vacated if DDI 
prevails on the merits. Br. of Mosey et al. at 1; Br. of Frosty Bites Distribution LLC at 1. Their objections are denied. "
72,1," Defendants are: Micron Technology, Inc., and Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (collectively ""Micron""); Infineon 
Technologies AG, and Infineon Technologies North America Corp. (collectively ""Infineon""); Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., and Hynix 
Semiconductor America, Inc. (collectively ""Hynix""); Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. 
(collectively ""Samsung""); Mosel-Vitelic Corporation, and Mosel-Vitelic Corporation (USA)(collectively ""Mosel-Vitelic""); Nanya 
Technology Corporation, and Nanya Technology Corporation USA (""NTC"" and ""NTC USA,"" respectively); Winbond Electronics 
Corporation, and Winbond Electronics Corporation America (collectively ""Winbond""); Elpida Memory, Inc., and Elpida Memory 
(USA) Inc. (collectively ""Elpida""); and NEC Electronics America, Inc. (""NEC""). To date, however, seven of these nine defendant 
groupings have entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs. Accordingly, only two defendant entities remain, and proceed 
before the court here on the instant motions for summary judgment — Nanya, and Mosel-Vitelic. "
75,2," Plaintiffs also drop a footnote in their opposition brief, and further argued at the hearing on this matter, that NTC ""could also be 
held vicariously liable for the acts of [NTC USA] under an agency theory,"" as distinguished from an alter ego theory. See Opp. 
Br. at 33 fn. 27. Plaintiffs cited no evidence in support of this assertion, however, relying only on the bald assumption that 
""without [NTC USA], the parent company [NTC] would have to perform"" the marketing and sales functions that Nanya USA 
engages in. Such conclusory argument, with no supporting evidence, is unpersuasive, and the court declines plaintiffs' invitation 
to find an agency theory of liability applicable to NTC on the record before it."
75,3," NTC also makes the somewhat baffling argument that it does not stand accused of price fixing. Plaintiffs' complaint explicitly 
charges that defendant — among others — entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to unreasonably restrain trade, 
the substantial terms of which were to fix and maintain the price for DRAM. See Third Consolidated Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 61, 
63. It is difficult to conclude from this that NTC does not stand ""accused"" of price fixing, for it is clear from the complaint that this "
76,," is precisely what plaintiffs accuse. To the extent, however, that NTC really means simply that plaintiffs have not successfully 
proven the actual existence of any agreement to actually fix prices, this argument is dealt with in the body of this section. "
78,4," As defendants note, even conscious parallelism — i.e., a company's independent and voluntary decision to track prices and 
production of competitors — is not unlawful standing alone. See, e.g., Blomkest Fertilizer, Inc. v. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, 
203 F.3d 1028, 1032 (8th Cir.)."
78,5," Originally, Dr. Noll's report was submitted in connection with the Winbond entity defendants' accompanying motion for 
summary judgment, and plaintiffs relied on that submission in citing to the report. Winbond withdrew its motion, however, "
79,," following its settlement with plaintiffs, thereby withdrawing the Noll report from consideration as well. In order to cure this 
problem, and at the court's request, plaintiffs re-submitted Dr. Noll's report by way of a separate declaration. The Nanya entity 
defendants have now filed objections to the re-submission of Dr. Noll's expert report, in part based on timeliness issues. The 
court hereby OVERRULES defendants' objections. "
83,6," Moreover, contrary to NTC USA's characterization of Dr. Noll's testimony, what Dr. Noll actually said was that plaintiffs' 
collusion allegations can include the exchange of information regarding price, in addition to ""a naked price fixing agreement."" 
See Benjamin Decl., Ex. W at 164:3-17. This supports, rather than undercuts, the application of per se analysis here. To the 
extent, therefore, that NTC USA's arguments address the need for plaintiffs to establish harm or impact on the market, as part of 
a rule of reason analysis, NTC USA's arguments are irrelevant. See, e.g., National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 
U.S. 679, 690, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)(rule of reason requires analysis of alleged conduct's effect on market). "
87,7," Defendants have lodged numerous objections to the documents discussed herein. The court notes that some of the documents 
relied on by plaintiffs and objected to by defendants — particularly those belonging to the first category of communications from 
or to NTC USA — are admissible. See, e.g., Sampson Decl., Exs. 106, 111-12. By contrast, it is unlikely that many of the 
documents belonging to the category of communications from or to non-NTC USA sources are admissible. See, e.g., Sampson 
Decl., Exs. 46, 57. The court need not rule on the admissibility of all documents submitted and at issue, however; it is enough 
that it finds some documents admissible and sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact, as described above. The parties 
are, of course, entitled to raise objections to evidence not ruled on herein at trial. "
92,8," The court's conclusion is also guided in part by the fact that the Supreme Court has specifically recognized two types of ""pass-
on"" theories that may be used — defensive, and offensive. The defensive pass-on theory was first discussed in Hanover Shoe, 
where defendants attempted to use it to demonstrate that the direct purchaser plaintiffs had not established true antitrust injury. 
See 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231. In Illinois Brick, by contrast, the offensive use of the pass-on theory was 
utilized by indirect purchaser plaintiffs trying to establish antitrust injury for standing purposes under the Sherman Act. See 431 
U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707. As a practical matter, it makes intuitive sense that where — as here — defendants 
utilize the defensive pass-on theory, they should bear the burden of proof (and where plaintiffs employ offensive use of the pass-
on theory, it is plaintiffs who bear the burden). "
97,1," Due to multiple requested extensions of time, the Plaintiff's response to the Comptroller's motion was not filed until December 
13, 2006."
97,2," This is the latest name change cum acronym for TDFPS which was previously known as the Texas Department of Protective 
and Regulatory Services."
97,3," The Plaintiff filed a Motion to Exclude from the Court's consideration the contents of this report, which the Defendants' had 
originally attached to their Rule 12(b)(6) Motion. The Defendants, in response to Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude, assented, stating 
that they ""do not object to this court excluding the report from consideration when deciding their Rule 12(b)(6) motion."" See 
Comptroller Defendants' Response to Motion to Exclude at 2 (Clerk's Doc. No. 46). Therefore, the Court will not consider the 
report. "
98,4," In her Response to the Rule 12(b)(6) Motion Plaintiff contends that she is also advancing a § 1986 cause of action. There is 
not, however, a § 1986 claim made in either the First or Second Amended Complaints, and the Court will treat this statement in 
the response as an error. "
100,5," Defendants' cite a Texas Supreme Court case for the proposition that the ""employer must unequivocally indicate a definite 
intent to be bound not to terminate the employee except under clearly specified circumstances."" Montgomery County Hosp. Dist. 
v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502, 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 537 (Tex. 1998). While this is no doubt the case, the Court would be 
engaging in weighing just how ""unequivocal"" or ""definite"" the intent of the Camp's agreement with Plaintiff was if it were to grant 
the motion to dismiss on this issue. This is not appropriate at this stage of the litigation."
100,6," The issue, it seems, would turn on availability of pre-verus post-deprivation notice and hearing. See, e.g., Cleveland Board of 
Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985) (""The root requirement of the Due Process 
Clause is that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant protected interest""). "
102,7," There is also authority for the proposition that the Supreme Court has applied Noerr-Pennington outside of the antitrust context. 
See e.g., Barnes Foundation v. Township Lower Merion, 242 F.3d 151 (3d Cir. 2001)."
102,8," Plaintiff also argues that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine only applies to private persons, not government officials. Defendants 
cogently argue that Plaintiff is suing them in their individual, not official, capacities -- as they must, see Esteves v. Brock, 106 
F.3d 674, 677 (5th Cir. 1997) (""As a state officer acting in her official capacity, however, Brock is protected by the Eleventh 
Amendment from suit under section 1983 for money damages"") -- therefore she cannot deny that Noerr-Pennington applies in 
this case because the case law infra, e.g. Herr, 274 F.3d 109 (3d Cir. 2001), holds that the immunity attaches to officials sued in "
103,," the individual capacity (and even the dissent, whose reasoning the Plaintiff champions, agrees with this point). Therefore, the 
whole issue of whether Noerr-Pennington immunity is only available to private parties is moot because all the Defendants are 
private parties being sued in their individual capacity."
103,9," That is, Plaintiff argues, some of the activity enumerated above cannot be classified as petitioning activity. This is true, but, as 
the Court has just found, that activity, in any event, does not violate her substantive due process rights."
103,10," The Court is aware of the ""sham"" litigation exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity, however, it is difficult to see how that 
exception would apply to this case and neither party briefed this point. See Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia 
Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993) (defining the ""sham"" exception to Noerr-
Pennington immunity to include ""only lawsuits that are both objectively baseless and subjectively intended to abuse process"")."
103,11," It is worth noting the peculiar nature of the facts in this case. As discussed in the text, Defendants, even though government 
employees when the “campaign” against Woodside Trails took place, are for purposes of this suit private citizens. See infra note 
7. Therefore, cases where the defendants are government officials and cases where the defendants are private citizens are 
instructive for present purposes."
103,12," While Plaintiff includes perfunctory language about equal protection violations in each of her first six counts, the only legal 
arguments she makes in her Response are those delineated above. "
104,13," Although it is not entirely clear from her Response, it appears that Plaintiff, when she complains that the children at the Camp 
were removed without the option of ""risk evaluation"" (a process that was offered to others accused of abuse) is arguing about an 
equal protection violation personal to her. See Plaintiff's Response at 35-36. However, even if that is the case, the point remains 
that the ""risk evaluation"" was a TDFPS decision, not one made by the Comptrollers."
104,14," Contrary to Defendants' assertion, in Count I of her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff pleads a First Amendment retaliation 
claim. See Complaint at 39."
104,15," For example, one of Defendants' arguments here is that because Plaintiff's license was restored after the administrative 
hearing, and because she has no protected interest in her employment, she cannot uphold her burden because the Fifth Circuit 
has construed Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976), to require ""a section 1983 plaintiff to show 
stigma plus an infringement of some other interest."" Blackburn v. City of Marshall, 42 F.3d 925, 935-36 (5th Cir. 1995). In other 
words, Defendants contend Plaintiff cannot show the ""plus"" because all of her other claims fail. This argument, however, puts 
the cart before the horse. The Fifth Circuit, in Breax v. City of Garland, noted that ""Stigma, by itself, without an impact on one's 
employment, does not constitute an adverse employment action."" 205 F.3d 150, 158 n. 14 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing Blackburn, 42 
F.3d at 935-36) (emphasis added). "
108,*," The Honorable Thomas W. Phillips, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation. "
111,1," The district court rejected the registers' abstention and preclusion arguments, and the registers have not appealed."
111,2," With regard to count two's procedural due-process claim, the district court held that First American failed to establish a liberty or 
property interest in the ability to purchase public records at a bulk rate with the right to resell them. With regard to the 
substantive due-process and equal protection claims, the district court held that the registers' practices bore a rational relation to 
the legitimate state interest in maintaining and increasing revenue from public record sales. Regarding count three, the district 
court denied summary judgment, finding ""a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Registers are indeed illegally 
maintaining a system of abstract of title"" in violation of Michigan statute. The district court later issued a separate opinion 
dismissing count three, holding that the relevant state statute did not provide a private right of action. First American has not 
appealed the dismissal of counts two and three. "
112,3," In Parts II and III of his opinion, which we quote and rely on here, Justice Brennan spoke only for four Justices: himself and 
Justices Marshall, Powell, and Stevens. Several of the registers attack Lafayette as ""merely a plurality opinion having no 
precedential force."" Their attempt to escape Lafayette is unavailing. As the Supreme Court noted twenty-five years ago, the 
Lafayette plurality's ""standard has since been adopted by a majority of the Court."" City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 51 (citing New 
Motor Vehicle Bd. of Calif. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978) and Midcal, 445 U.S. at 
105). "
113,4," As a condition for continuing to sell title records to First American, the Lapeer register required First American to sign an 
agreement that prohibited it from using the documents for any purpose other than internal underwriting. First American signed 
the agreement for 2001 but refused to renew for 2002. The Lapeer register then refused to sell title records to First American at 
a bulk discount and in non-paper form as it had previously done. Beginning in 2003, the Eaton register required First American 
to sign a similar agreement and likewise stopped providing title records at a bulk discount and in non-paper formats when First 
American refused to agree to the restrictions on resale. The Newaygo and Saginaw registers took similar measures beginning in 
December 2004 and January 2005, respectively. "
114,5," On a related note, First American cannot defeat state-action immunity by showing that the registers' imposition of a no-resale 
condition was a misuse of or exceeded their legal authority. Stringham v. Hubbard, No. Civ-S-05-0898, -- F. Supp. 2d --, 2006 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78154, 2006 WL 3053079, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2006) (U.S.M.J.) (citing Lancaster Cmty. Hosp. v. Antelope

115,6," See M.C.L. § 565.42 (""Any mortgage shall also be discharged upon the record thereof by the register of deeds, in whose 
custody it shall be, whenever there shall be presented to him a certificate executed by the mortgagee . . . specifying that such 
mortgage has been paid, or otherwise satisfied or discharged; or upon the presentation to such register of deeds of the 
certificate of the circuit court . . . certifying . . . that said mortgage has been duly paid, or upon the presentation to such register 
of deeds of a certificate of the register in chancery of the county . . . certifying that a decree of foreclosure of any such mortgage 
has been duly entered in his office, and that the records in his office shows [sic] that such decree has been fully paid and 
satisfied.""). M.C.L. § 565.43 provides, in part, ""Every certificate described in [M.C.L. § 565.42], and the proof or acknowledgment of the 
certificate, shall be recorded at full length, and a reference shall be made to the book and page containing the certificate, in the 
minute of the discharge of the mortgage made by the register upon the mortgage."" "
116,7," See M.C.L. § 211.135 (before recording deed or contract, register must obtain certificates confirming that taxes have been paid 
and all tax liens satisfied on the property for past five years)."

certificate of sale with the county register within ten days, and the register must record it). "
117,9, The Michigan courts have not yet had occasion to provide guidance on this issue.
117,10," The Michigan FOIA definition of public body excludes the judiciary but includes every state officer, employee, or agency in the 
executive branch, except the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and their executive offices and executive office employees; 
every agency or other body in the legislative branch; and every county, regional, or local body or agency. M.C.L. §§ 15.232(d)(i-
v). It defines public record as ""a writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by a public body in the 
performance of an official function, from the time it is created"" and defines ""writing"" to include every ""means of recording or 
retaining meaningful content."" M.C.L. §§ 15.232(e) and (h)."
117,11," Simpson was superseded by statute, but on other grounds. See United States v. Moore, 917 F.2d 215 (6th Cir. 1990)."
117,12," See, e.g., Sherrod v. Genzyme Corp., 170 F. App'x 375, 378 (6th Cir. 2006) (""M.C.L. § 445.774a(1)'s specific authorization of 
non-compete agreements trumps the other statutes' inclusion of such agreements within their general prohibition on 
'consideration' as a condition of employment.""). "
118,13," The Lapeer register admits as much: ""Actually, the more specific statute, MCL 565.551, controls. * * * MCL 15.443 is not 
relevant."""
118,14," Conversely, we are not persuaded by First American's argument that the enhanced access act shows that the registers are 
not entitled to state-action immunity. First American asserts, ""The Enhanced Access Act not only did not contemplate pricing structures to punish competition . . . it 
prohibits them."" But the enhanced access act does no such thing; it authorizes public bodies to provide copies to other public 
bodies free of charge, not to private parties free of charge, and it says nothing about prohibiting or allowing private parties to re-
sell copies or the information therein. First American also asserts, ""The language in the Enhanced Access Act relating to pricing confirms that restrictions against 
resale not only were not contemplated by the Legislature, but are contrary to the goals of the Act. This Act limits the fees public 
bodies may charge to 'an amount that enables the public body providing access to or output from its system to recover over time 
its operating expenses directly related to providing access to output from its system to a third party.'"" We fail to see how a 
limitation on the fees that public bodies may charge for digital copies evinces an intent to prohibit public bodies from imposing 
no-resale conditions on private purchasers of those copies."
118,15," The last subsection of the act provides: ""This act does not require a public body to provide enhanced access to a specific 
public record if that public body has not established an enhanced access policy in accordance with subsection (5) with respect to 
that specific record."" M.C.L. § 15.443(6). "
119,16," See, e.g., Cavanaugh v. Cardinal Local Sch. Dist., 409 F.3d 753, 756 (6th Cir. 2005) (""Applying the canon of exclusio unius 
est exclusio alterius. . . we conclude . . . .""). "
120,17," The district court did not cite Southern Motor, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985)."
120,18," M.C.L. § 45.3 is extremely general, providing, ""Each organized county shall be a body politic and corporate, for the following 
purposes . . . to make all necessary contracts, and to do all other necessary acts in relation to the property and concerns of the 
county."" This provision does not refer to the register of deeds, let alone to the provision of duplicate title records or title 
information."
120,19," M.C.L. § 46.11(l) provides that a county board of commissioners may ""[r]epresent the county and have the care and 
management of the property and business of the county if other provisions are not made."" M.C.L. § 46.11(m) provides that a 
county board of commissioners may ""[e]stablish rules and regulations in reference to the management of the interest and 
business concerns of the county as the board considers necessary and proper in all matters not especially provided for in this 
act or under the laws of this state."" These provisions do not refer to the register of deeds, let alone to the provision of duplicate 
title records or title information. "
121,20," See Wayne v. Vill. of Sebring, 36 F.3d 517, 526 (6th Cir. 1994) (""We reject the state court of appeals' interpretation of federal 
law.""). "
122,21," See also Hertz Corp. v. City of N.Y., 1 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 1994) (holding that in Sherman Act § 1 action, state-action immunity 
did not apply to city ordinance that prohibited basing vehicle rental fees and decisions on the renter's residence; city acted 
pursuant to general home-rule powers, not any specific grant of authority over vehicle rentals). "
125,22," Furthermore, a finding of a Sherman Act violation will not obligate the registers to (1) reproduce records for First American or 
anyone else, rather than merely providing equipment for the purchaser to reproduce the records himself; (2) offer a bulk discount 
to First American or anyone else for the reproduction of paper or non-paper records; or (3) make records available to First 
American or anyone else in non-paper format in the first place. The Legislature has expressly granted the registers discretion to 
determine the medium in which original title records are reproduced, i.e., paper or non-paper. M.C.L. § 565.551(2)(a). The 
Legislature has also expressly granted the registers discretion to fulfill a title record request either by reproducing the record 
itself or by providing equipment for the purchaser to do the reproduction (or, if the purchaser requests it, by letting the purchaser 
bring in his own equipment and doing the reproduction). M.C.L. §§ 565.551(2)(a)-(c). The registers will still have the authority, under M.C.L. § 565.551(2)(a), to offer non-paper reproduction, in any of the formats 
prescribed by the records reproduction act, M.C.L. § 24.402, to all purchasers or to no purchasers. Nor will the district court's 
decision affect the registers' authority to offer bulk discounts to all purchasers or to no purchasers. "
127,1," The facts underlying Mylan's Complaint have been summarized in this Court's June 13, 2006 Memorandum Opinion and Order. "
129,2," As discussed in detail in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Lab., 90 F. Supp. 2d 540 (D.N.J. 2000), the structure of these 
statutes means that, if antitrust injury were tied to the status of FDA approval relative to the required timing of the suit, antitrust 
injury would be ""wholly contingent on the vagaries of timing of agency action"" and go against the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman 
Act. Id. at 545. If the FDA approved the ANDA before the patentee filed its motion to dismiss the antitrust counterclaim, then 
antitrust injury would exist; but if the FDA took too long to complete the approval process, the generic company would be unable 
to establish injury to support its antitrust counterclaim. "
139,1, All statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.
139,2," Sections 17200 through 17209 are commonly referred to as the unfair competition law or UCL. (Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. 
Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558, fn. 2 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)"
139,3," Certain of the plaintiffs, public officials whom we denote the Bustamante group, do not join in the antitrust claims but make 
additional UCL claims based on Penal Code violations. (Pen. Code, §§ 395, 396.) The same basic theories pertain to all the 
causes of action and we need not discuss these additional distinctions separately. "
140,4," Apparently, those settlements with those other defendants also included other related claims, and are not informative with 
regard to the issues on this appeal."
140,5," In addition to suing these four major employers in the business of wholesale electric trading and marketing, plaintiffs named 
three individual defendants, who were management employees of the Dynegy group. No separate allegations are made about 
the individual defendants and we refer to all defendants collectively."
140,6," The ISO continues to manage the wholesale electricity market, but the PX is no longer in operation. Plaintiffs' allegations relate 
to the period during which the PX was still participating in the market. "
141,7," Plaintiffs appropriately request judicial notice on appeal of various FERC proceedings and decisions in the record, outlining the 
scope of its jurisdiction as granted by the FPA (16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq.). These orders and decisions deal with rate schedules 
and proposed market-based rates and tariffs, and are submitted by plaintiffs to provide examples of FERC's duties to review 
whether rates and rate-related practices are just and reasonable, and to provide remedies for violations. (16 U.S.C. §§ 824d, 
824e.) We need not discuss several of plaintiffs' arguments made below, which are not pursued on appeal, such as the 
purported distinction between the roles of sellers and other participants in the market, such that “at a minimum the case should 
proceed against traders and generators.” "
149,8," The FPA, § 205, cited in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1015–1016, is now codified at 16 United States Code section 824d. 
(U.S.C.A. Tables, vol. I, p. 251.)"
149,9," See also T & E Pastorino v. Duke Energy Trading (9th Cir. 2005) 123 Fed.Appx. 813, holding UCL allegations regarding 
transactions in the wholesale energy market fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of FPA, where tariffs approved by FERC would 
provide the context for determination of any violations of the UCL. "
159,*," The Honorable Richard D. Cudahy, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by 
designation. "
160,1," Philip Morris USA, Inc., by contrast, accounted for nearly 50 of all cigarette sales in 2000. Marlboro, Philip Morris's largest 
brand, commanded a 38 share, over 50 higher than the combined shares of all of RJR's brands."
160,2, Rebates paid to distributors at the close of each quarter.
160,3," Wholesalers received certain Level 3 payments (received as quarterly rebates) once they qualified for Level 2 discounts, as 
long as changes in their RJR share during the relevant quarter did not differ meaningfully from changes in RJR's statewide share 
during the same period. Level 2 wholesalers also earned other Level 3 rebates to the extent they performed additional functions 
that RJR sought to reward."
160,4," RJR modified the WPP several times from August 2000 to the present. From the second quarter of 2002 through the third 
quarter of 2003, Level 2 contained the eight price categories (Levels A-H). Level 2A was set at the minimum Level 2 RJR share 
of savings (""SOS"") brands threshold to 1.5 share points above this minimum SOS threshold; only when a distributor exceeded "
161,," its Level 2A SOS quota by 30.1 points would it then qualify for Level 2H back-end monies. In 2003, RJR again modified the WPP 
to further reduce the Level 2 and 3 back-end monies available to Level 2A distributors."
161,5," Only the WPP for the years 2000-2003 are at issue in the present case. The 2004-2005 WPP is identical to that of its 
competitor, Philip Morris USA, Inc.'s Wholesale Leaders Program, which has been similarly challenged as a violation of the 
antitrust laws and is currently pending before this court. See Smith Wholesale Co. et. al. v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., Case # 05-
6481. "
162,6," RJR appealed, but voluntarily dismissed its consolidated appeal of those preliminary injunctions on June 27, 2005, after the 
entry of summary judgment in its favor in the instant case."
162,7, The States have not joined in the present appeal from the order granting summary judgment to defendant. 
164,8," The precise issue addressed by the Court was ""whether a manufacturer offering its dealers different wholesale prices may be 
held liable for price discrimination proscribed by Robinson-Patman, absent a showing that the manufacturer discriminated 
between dealers contemporaneously competing to resell to the same retail customer[?]"" 126 S. Ct. at 866. Reeder, a Volvo 
dealer, commenced suit against Volvo alleging that its sales decreased because Volvo offered other favored dealers price 
concessions not offered to Reeder. At issue were specially ordered heavy-duty trucks supplied by Volvo and sold by franchised 
dealers through a competitive bidding process by which the retail customer stated its specifications and invited bids from dealers 
franchised by different manufacturers. When a Volvo dealer received the customer's specifications, it contacted Volvo and 
requested a discount off the wholesale price. Volvo then decided, on a case-by-case basis, whether to offer a discount and, if so, 
what the discount would be, taking into account such factors as industry-wide demand and the retail customer's history of 
purchasing certain brands of trucks. The dealer then incorporated the discount offered by Volvo into its bid and purchased the 
trucks only if the retail customer accepted the bid. In 1997, Volvo announced a projected reduction in the number of authorized dealers. Coincidentally, Reeder learned that Volvo 
had given another dealer a price concession greater than the concessions Reeder typically received. Reeder suspected that it 
was one of the dealers Volvo targeted for elimination. Reeder filed suit, alleging losses attributable to Volvo's purported 
violations of state law and the Robinson-Patman Act. Reeder prevailed at trial and on appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The Supreme Court, however, reversed and remanded, concluding that ""[a]bsent actual competition with a favored 
Volvo dealer . . . Reeder cannot establish the competitive injury required under the Act."" 126 S. Ct. at 870. The Supreme Court 
held that Reeder's proffered comparisons fell short of showing price discrimination, because in none of the specific instances "
165,," upon which Reeder relied did Reeder compete with beneficiaries of the alleged discrimination for the same customer. Moreover, 
Reeder failed to demonstrate that the compared dealers were consistently favored vis-a-vis Reeder; Reeder merely cited 
occasions when it competed with non-Volvo dealers for a sale to a customer. The Court noted that ""[t]he Act centrally addresses 
price discrimination in cases involving competition between different purchasers for resale of the purchased product. 
Competition of that character ordinarily is not involved when a product subject to special order is sold through a customer-
specific competitive bidding process."" Id. at 866. ""Here, there is no discrete 'favored' dealer comparable to a chain store or a 
large independent department store -- at least, Reeder's evidence is insufficient to support an inference of such a dealer or set 
of dealers."" Id. at 871. "
167,9," ""By statute, an otherwise illegal discriminatory payment for, or furnishing of, services or facilities is permissible if made 
available on proportional terms to all purchasers. 15 U.S.C. §§ 13(d), (e). Section 13(a) contains no comparable language, but 
the 'functional availability' [doctrine] has been judicially extended to that section."" Allied Sales & Serv. Co. v. Global Indus. 
Techs., Inc., No. Civ. A. 97-0017-CB-M, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, 2000 WL 726216, at *17 (S.D. Ala. May 1, 2000) 
(unpublished)."
167,10," The doctrine of functional availability is not to be confused with the issue of ""functional discounts"" -- i.e., discounts based upon 
a particular marketing or distribution function, such as warehousing or delivery services, performed by the customer receiving 
the discount. See Texaco, Inc., 496 U.S. at 571 (""A functional discount that constitutes a reasonable reimbursement for the 
purchaser's actual marketing functions will not violate the Act.""). "
171,11," See also Metro Ford Truck Sales, 145 F.3d at 326 (Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that wholesale discount program, 
offered by the defendant manufacturer to all of its authorized truck dealers to help with bidding for large volume purchasers, did 
not constitute unlawful price discrimination because program was in fact, and not merely theoretically, available to all dealers 
and the plaintiff conceded that the discounts were available to it on an equal basis with other Ford dealers); Comcoa, Inc., 931 
F.2d at 664 (Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that availability ""defense"" applied to special volume discounts offered on 
technologically obsolescent equipment; court approved jury instruction that stated for the availability doctrine to apply, ""the 
implementation of a discount program need not guarantee that all customers benefit to the same degree as other customers, as 
long as the program is evenly administered""); Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Ragu Foods, Inc., 627 F.2d 919, 929 (9th Cir. 1980) 
(summary judgment proper where it was undisputed that defendant manufacturer made contested discounts ""equally available to 
any qualified purchaser in any market""); FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.2d 1019, 1024-25 (2d Cir. 1976) 
(""[W]hile the incentive payment plan did not set a single uniform price for all types of sales made by Ford to its dealers, it was 
administered with an even hand, without any discrimination among the dealers who purchased from Ford.""); Rod Baxter Imports, 
Inc. v. Saab-Scania of America, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 245, 247 (D. Minn. 1980) (no price discrimination occurred where bonus 
payments under Sell-a-Bration sales incentive program were ""available on a reasonably equivalent basis to all dealers who 
made the commitment to obtain them"" and the failure of some dealers to reach their quotas was the result of factors other than 
program, such as low inventory, poor financing, reduced sales forces, and poor management). "
172,12," Plaintiffs cite the Caribe, Calumet Breweries, and National Dairy decisions for the proposition that, pursuant to § 13(a), a seller 
cannot legally condition price concessions on self-damaging sacrifices by a buyer, particularly where sacrifices of equal 
magnitude would not be required of the buyer's more favored competitors. However, we find these cases to be inapposite to the 
present circumstances. All of these cases involved inherently suspect volume discounts which permitted large buyers to secure 
a competitive advantage over a small buyer because of the large buyer's quantity purchasing ability. In Caribe, allegations that 
the plaintiff retailer did not know that its competitors were receiving favored treatment from the defendant manufacturer were 
sufficient to establish that the favored treatment was unavailable to the retailer so as to allow a claim to proceed under § 13(a). 
Contrary to the present plaintiffs' assertion, the case did not turn upon the plaintiff's argument that it should not be required to 
give up various advantages of its importer's contract. Rather, the Caribe court specifically declined to endorse that argument and 
made clear that ""if a seller makes its favorable prices and terms available to an otherwise disfavored customer, that customer 
has no legal right to complain."" 19 F.3d at 751. The present case bears little resemblance to Calumet Breweries, Inc., a case of ""blatantly discriminatory"" favoritism, where the 
defendant supplier structured its volume discount program to specifically favor its largest customer, by effectively granting a 
secret discount, imposing inventory restrictions, and limiting the array of products available to the disfavored customer. 951 F. 
Supp. at 754. Noting that, pursuant to Morton Salt, an inference of competitive injury arises from any quantity discount, the court 
stated, ""[n]othing in the Robinson-Patman Act or the cases interpreting it suggests that [the disfavored purchaser's] decision to 
emphasize other brands and remain a (relatively) small seller of [the defendant's] products ipso facto means [the defendant] may 
charge [the disfavored purchaser] a higher price."" Id. at 755. As noted by Barbara O. Bruckman in Discounts, Discrimination, and 
Exclusive Dealing: Issues Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 68 Antitrust L.J. 253, 270 (2000), Calumet ""should not be read to 
weaken the general principle that if a customer can take advantage of a discount but chooses for its own reasons not to do so, 
the seller is not later liable under Section 2(a) for losses that the customer may suffer by virtue of that choice."" Finally, in National Dairy, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that an order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring a 
dairy product distributor using volume discount schedules in various states to cease unlawful price practices was not an abuse of 
discretion, noting that ""[w]e also cannot accept National's argument that the disfavored independents should have joined 
voluntary or cooperative groups and thus obtained higher discounts. The Robinson-Patman Act does not force them to sacrifice "
173,," their independence."" 395 F.2d at 523. The present case, unlike National Dairy, neither involves a volume discount nor avers that 
plaintiffs must join forces and sacrifice their independence in order to protect themselves from large distributors. In sum, none of these cases support plaintiffs' assertion that § 13(a) does not require them to change their business structure, 
reconfigure their customer base, or undertake an expensive and risky business plan. To the contrary, a discount program may 
be functionally available even when the choice ""would have threatened [the plaintiff's] very existence,"" Amer. Tara, 1981 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 14211, 1981 WL 375752 at *2, or when the choice ""would not be economically possible."" The Iams Co. Litigation, 
No. C-3-90-014, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22759, 1992 WL 1258514, at *2 (S.D. Ohio July 24, 1992) (unpublished)."
173,13," To the extent plaintiffs argue that the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant is improper 
because it is inconsistent with the court's earlier preliminary injunction ruling, this argument is without merit. It is well established 
that ""[t]he purpose of a preliminary injunction is simply to preserve the status quo; thus, findings of fact and conclusions of law 
made by a district court in granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at a trial on the merits."" United States v. Edward Rose 
& Sons, 384 F.3d 258, 261 (6th Cir. 2004). "
174,14," Plaintiffs also suggest that the district court's pronouncement in this regard fails as a matter of law to the extent it suggests that 
factors outside of the seller's (RJR's) control, such as consumer demand, are irrelevant to the functional availability issue. 
Otherwise stated, although plaintiffs agree that certain circumstances solely within the buyer's control, such as poor credit, see 
Bouldis, 711 F.2d at 1325, cannot render a program functionally unavailable, any circumstances not within the buyer's control 
are relevant to a determination whether the qualifications for the best price can be met as a functional or practical matter. 
Plaintiffs maintain that none of the circumstances making the WPP's best prices functionally unavailable in the instant matter are 
within plaintiffs' control. "
175,15," Specifically, plaintiffs assert as follows: Perhaps even more glaring a deficiency in RJR's experts' per capita income comparison is the binary classification of each 
county within a state as either ""served"" or ""unserved."" RJR's methodology fatally makes no provision for sales volume (in 
units or dollars) in any ""served"" county. A county in which a Plaintiff sells 10 cartons of cigarettes per month was given 
equal weight to one in which that same Plaintiff sold 10,000 cartons per month. This analysis made no effort to accurately 
reflect concentrations in Plaintiffs' business. "
176,16," Although not alleged in their complaint, plaintiffs broadly argue that WPP favors the largest distributors -- ""[T]he fact that 85 of 
RJR's volume may have qualified for Level 2 ""A"" pricing did not translate into 85 of RJR's distributors qualifying for that price. 
The 21 largest distributors (of around 700 direct accounts) control 50 of RJR's sales volume and are at the WPP's highest 
program levels."" This vague assertion is insufficient to support a claim that the WPP favors larger distributors by virtue of their 
greater purchasing power."

and Yakima."
176,18," Plaintiffs Affiliated, Dixie, George, Shanks, McCarty-Hull, Pelican, Rice, and Topicz. "
182,1," As Plaintiffs recognize, the OAG's promulgation of an ""Incompatible Activities Statement"" is required by Cal. Govt. Code § 
19990, which provides that ""[a] state officer or employee shall not engage in any employment, activity, or enterprise which is 
clearly inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to his or her duties as a state officer or employee."" Cal. Govt. Code 
§ 19990 further provides that ""[e]ach appointing power shall determine, subject to approval of the department, those activities 
which, for employees under its jurisdiction, are inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with their duties as state officers or 
employees."""
182,2," ""'To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff must show (1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a person 
acting under color of state law; and (2) that the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.'"" 
Hydrick v. Hunter, 466 F.3d 676, 689 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1989))."
182,3," In addition, because he is no longer serving as Attorney General, Defendant Lockyer is no longer a proper Defendant in his 
official capacity. See Defs' Request for Judicial Notice ¶1; Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). "
183,4," Defendants' additional arguments vis avis Plaintiffs' first cause of action are directed to the issues of qualified immunity and 
Goode-Parker's lack of standing. The Court determines that these arguments will be more appropriate for consideration after 
amendment of the Complaint, if any. "
184,5," Defendant Mauro was the Senior Assistant Attorney General for the Government Law Section. Defendant Motz was Plaintiffs' 
immediate supervisor. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 15.)"
184,6," Although the Complaint also references 42 U.S.C. § 1981, in their Opposition. Plaintiffs implicitly concede that 42 U.S.C. § 
1985(3) is the only section under which their ""conspiracy"" claim can be brought. (See Opp'n at 8.)"
184,7," In addition, although not yet addressed in the Ninth Circuit, numerous other circuit and district courts have held that, pursuant 
to the application of the ""infra-corporate conspiracy doctrine,"" individual employees of a single employer/governmental agency 
cannot conspire with one another for the purposes of giving rise to liability under § 1985(3). See Hoefer, 92 F.Supp.2d at 1057-
58 (collecting cases). Given the weight of the case law in favor of applying the doctrine, the Court agrees that it serves as an 
additional bar to Plaintiffs' claims as currently alleged. "
185,8," In addition, Defendants have requested the Court to take judicial notice of the pending SPB actions. Over Plaintiffs' objections, 
the Court agrees that these matters are the proper subject of judicial notice and are proper for consideration on a motion to 
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Fed R. Evid. 201; Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F. 3d 699, 706 (9th Cir. 1998) (""A district court 
ruling on a motion to dismiss may consider documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no 
party questions. . ."") (internal quotation marks omitted). At the same time, the Court sustains Defendants' objections to Plaintiffs' 
""exhibits"" to their Opposition to the Motion, as they are not the proper subject for judicial notice."
185,9," Specifically, Cal Govt. Code § 18671.1 provides that ""the period from the filing of the petition to the decision of the board shall 
not exceed six months or 90 days from the time of the submission, whichever time period is less, and except that the board may 
extend the six-month period up to 45 additional days"" and that ""the provisions relating to the six-month or the 90-day periods for 
a decision maybe waived by the employee but if not so waived, a failure to render a timely decision is an exhaustion of all 
available administrative remedies."""
185,10," In addition, the Court is cognizant of the fact that the pending SPB complaints appear to be directed only to retaliatory action 
taken against Gibson, and not Goode-Parker. Any amended Complaint must include allegations sufficient to establish 
exhaustion by both Plaintiffs. "
190,1," (a) Appointment. (1) Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may appoint a master only to: (A) perform duties consented to by the parties;"

magistrate judge of the district. "

consideration to these additional arguments. However, as discussed in more detail below, because I have resolved the instant

elements: ""1) unlawful conduct by the defendants; 2) an ascertainable loss on the part of the plaintiff; 3) a casual relationship 
between the defendants' unlawful conduct and the plaintiff's ascertainable loss."" N.J. Citizen Action v. Schering-Plough Corp., 
2002 WL 32344594, at *2 (N.J. Super. L. May 12, 2002).  [*80] Further, in order to state a monopolization claim under the New 
Jersey Antitrust Act, a party must prove the following four elements: ""1) relevant geographic and product market; 2) high 
probability of success of monopolization, 3) specific intent, and 4) conduct to further an attempt to monopolize."" D'Arrigo v. South 
Jersey Hosp., 2006 WL 2795337, at * 11 (N.J. Super. L. Aug. 25, 2006). By comparison, ""[i]n order to state a claim for abuse of 
process, the moving party must show: (1) an ulterior motive and (2) some further act after an issuance of process representing 
the perversion of the legitimate use of the process."" Falzo v. County of Essex, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19468, 2005 WL 2129927, 
at *4 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2005) (citation omitted). Although the elements of these respective claims are different, the means of proof 
is effectively the same because the ""issue[s] at bar relate[] directly to administrative proceedings before the PTO ...."" see Abbott 
Labs. v. Brennan, 952 F.2d 1346, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1991) or are derivative of administrative proceedings before the PTO. 
Similarly, because the state law claims posed by the IP Plaintiffs in this matter relate directly to or are derivative of Schering's 
alleged fraudulent  [*81] activities or ""inequitable conduct"" before the PTO, there is essentially no difference between the instant 
claims for relief and the claims brought in Abbott Labs. or Semiconductor Energy, as each set of claims ultimately challenges 
conduct before the PTO."
209,24," The ""as applied"" test is the proper test for evaluating state law claims. See Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 
F.3d 1318, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (""If a plaintiff bases its tort action on conduct that is protected or governed by federal patent 
law, then the plaintiff may not invoke the state law remedy, which must be preempted for conflict with federal patent law.... This 
approach, which considers whether a state tort, 'as-applied,' conflicts with federal patent law, is consistent with that employed by 
the Supreme Court in cases involving preemption of state unfair competition law""). "
214,1," On January 19, 2006, defendant ExxonMobil filed its Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint. (Doc. 23.) The Court entered 
a briefing schedule (Doc. 25), and the parties fully briefed the motion. On June 16, 2006, ExxonMobil filed a Supplemental 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (Doc. 34), and this Court again ordered the parties to brief the motion. 
Because ExxonMobil relied on several affidavits, along with Plaintiffs' cancelled settlement checks, in support of its 
Supplemental Motion to Dismiss, this Court determined that the motion would be more appropriately considered as a motion for 
summary judgment. (Doc. 40.) ExxonMobil then filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment in response to the Court's Order."
214,2," Plaintiffs define the proposed class as: All sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, other entities, and natural person in the United States, its territories, 
possession and protectorates who have received royalty payments from one or more of the Defendants or one of their co-
conspirators on gas and other substances produced from the Big Escambia Creek Field [*5]  (""BEC"") under leases which, 
(a) provide gas royalty payments on a ""market value at the well"" or ""market value at the mouth of the well"" basis and (b) are 
""standard"" leases for royalty payment purposes. (Doc. 63, p. 36.) Plaintiffs allege that the class exceeds six hundred individuals nationwide."
214,3," When Plaintiffs use the term ""drainage"" they are referring to ""the migration of oil or gas in a reservoir due to pressure reduction 
caused by production from a nearby well bottomed in the reservoir."" (Doc. 63, p. 10.)"
214,4," The facts set out in this opinion are gleaned from the parties' submissions of facts claimed to be undisputed, the plaintiffs' 
complaint, and the Court's own examination of the evidentiary record. All reasonable doubts about the facts have been resolved 
in favor of the nonmoving party. See Info. Sys. & Networks Corp. v. City of Atlanta, 281 F.3d 1220, 1224 (11th Cir. 2002). These 
are the ""facts"" for summary judgment purposes only. They may not be the actual facts. See Cox v. Adm'r U.S. Steel & Carnegie 
Pension Fund, 17 F.3d 1386, 1400 (11th Cir. 1994). "
215,5," Plaintiffs Rosetta G. Flowers, Stanley C. Godwin, Clark Ziglar, Bobby Ziglar, Autry Ziglar, and Sandra Wilson are plaintiffs who 
receive royalties for gas units that are still in production, while plaintiff Fed Stanley, Jr., receives royalties for a gas unit that has 
been plugged and abandoned. "
216,6," The Agreement provides, in pertinent part, as follows:"
216,3," .17 Release and Indemnification of the Companny a. Upon the Company's payment of the Settlement Proceeds under paragraph 3.11, above, each Class Representative and 
Settlement Class Member shall be deemed and adjudged to release, acquit and forever discharge the Company from any 
and all claims, demands, damages (whether actual or punitive), debts, liabilities, accounts and causes of action of every 
kind and nature, whether in law or in equity, arising in contract or in tort, including but not limited to claims for alleged fraud, 
breach of fiduciary duties, accounting, conversion, suppression, negligence, joint enterprise, [*13]  conspiracy, unjust 
enrichment, constructive trust, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, wantonness, and every other claim or theory of recovery, 
legal or equitable, of any type or character whatsoever, directly or indirectly, whether asserted or not, that he, she or it may 
have had or may now have as a result of, or arising or resulting from the calculation, payment, and reporting of royalties on 
natural gas . . . produced from BEC by the Company . . . . (Doc. 43, Exhibit B.) "
217,7," The Court is aware of the fact that ExxonMobil's motion for summary judgment was filed prior to the Court granting Plaintiffs' 
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 54). (Doc. 61.) However, in Plaintiffs' previously filed response to 
ExxonMobil's Supplement to Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 36) they directed the Court's attention to language in paragraph 3.17 of the 
Settlement Agreement which states: The Released Claims do not include claims related to oil or condensate produced from BEC, claims for drainage, or any 
other claims unrelated to the calculation, payment, or reporting of royalties on gas produced from BEC and/or on all gas 
substances extracted from such gas, as set forth above. (Doc. 43, Exhibit B (emphasis added).)"
217,8," ExxonMobil's motion seeks summary judgment on the first through third counts of the Amended Complaint, which were all 
claims arising under the federal antitrust laws. However, under the Second Amended Complaint only the first two counts allege 
antitrust injuries, while Count Three deals with alleged breaches of implied covenants relating to Plaintiffs' drainage theory 
claims. "
218,9," The Eleventh Circuit adopted the case law of the former Fifth Circuit handed down as of September 30, 1981, in Bonner v. City 
of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
223,1," In citing to additional documents throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court will refer to the docket item numbers used in 
Civil Action No. 05-485-JJF. "
224,2," Intel has also moved separately from this Motion to dismiss Class Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint for a variety of other reasons. 
Briefing on that Motion was completed on February 28, 2007, and the Court will address that Motion by separate Memorandum 
Opinion and Order. "
225,3," Though discussed in the context of the causation inquiry, the Court noted in its previous decision that allegations that Intel 
engaged in overseas conduct which resulted in higher PC prices and loss of consumer choice in the United States ""are not direct 
domestic effects of any alleged foreign conduct of Intel, but secondary and indirect effects that are also the by-product of 
numerous factors relevant to market conditions and the like."" Intel, 452 F. Supp. 2d at 561. "
229,1," If the sales figures are rounded to the nearest million, they are 110 million for sales in the United States, and 114 million for 
foreign sales. With these rounded sales figures, the damages figures returned by the jury corresponds precisely to a four cent 
per unit royalty."
229,2," Amado received this $ 5,911,269 damages award, plus interest in December  [*6] 2006, after the Court ordered the clerk to 
close the damages escrow account and transfer the final balance to Amado. The balance as of the date of that order, December 
12, 2006, was $ 6,145,302.79. "

233,6," There is sufficient space on the disc containing the domestic version of Office and Access to include all of SP2 on that disc. 
Sept. 11, 2006 Taylor Decl. P 14."
233,7," According to Microsoft, the OEMs use a master disc from Microsoft to create a master image of the software. This master 
image of Office and Access is then copied onto the computers the OEMs manufacture. Therefore, once the OEMs installed the 
SP2 disc onto the master image, used to produce the computers, the master, as well as the copies, became a ""fixed"" version of 
Office and Access. Consequently, the end users of the OEMs' computers received their computers with SP2 already installed. 
However, at least some OEMs send users back-up discs of Office and Access and SP2, which can be re-installed if necessary."
233,8," Volume or Enterprise licensees are business entities and other organizations. According to Microsoft, the information 
technology departments of these licensees will install the software in one of two ways - most likely they create a master image, 
like the OEMs, which is then installed on the individual computers in the office, but they may alternatively use the discs from 
Microsoft to install the software on each computer individually. "
234,9," Microsoft has objected to this evidence on the grounds of lack of authentication, hearsay and prejudice. These objections are 
OVERRULED. "
235,10," The Fifth Circuit later reversed the district court's order granting relief under Rule 60(b)(6), finding that an essential part of the 
patented invention was not disclosed in the brochure. Bros, Inc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 351 F.2d 208, 216 (5th Cir. 1965). "

239,12," Smith testified that ""in excess of 90 percent"" of the revenue reflected in the sales summaries Microsoft produced was 
attributable to the sale of the product license,  [*43] and not the Software Assurance component."" Dep. Tr. of Richard Smith at 
23:1-6, Moore Reply Decl., Ex. I. "
240,13," This footnote also explains that there was an error in the creation of some  [*46] spreadsheets provided to Amado because 
Academic licenses were double counted. However, this error is not relevant to the changes in the counts for Software Assurance 
and Recurring licenses because it did not affect these licenses."
240,14, Microsoft did not respond to these evidentiary objections. 
241,15," In the fall  [*51] of 2003 Amado filed a motion to compel discovery into the MS Sales database, which resulted in the parties' 
stipulation to use the Price Waterhouse spreadsheets as to ""total licenses,"" which Amado could rely on at trial as sales of the 
accused products. "
242,16," Yet, some OEMs send discs of the software along with the computers containing the software and therefore, at least some 
OEM customers could uninstall Office or Access and re-install the software without the SP2 fix. "
269,1, Hufnagel was also known as Vikki G. Hufnagel. 
270,2," The underlining did not appear in Hufnagel's counterfeit website. We have added this emphasis as the underlined statements 
are discussed in detail in subsequent parts of this opinion."
270,3," The disclaimer at the top of the counterfeit website read: ""This site was created by the supporters of the work of Dr. Vicki 
Hufnagel. The site is informational [and provides] full and complete disclosure which Dr. Del Junco's site does not provide. This 
site is to make [] aware of the politics of medicine and the economic driving forces that take place everyday that . . . drive all

273,5," Civil Code section 3344, subdivision (a) and (d) read in pertinent part: ""(a) Any person who knowingly uses another's name, . . . photograph, or likeness, in any manner, . . . without such person's prior 
consent, . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof. In addition, in any 
action brought under this section, the person who violated the section shall be liable to the injured party or parties in an amount 
equal to the greater of seven hundred fifty dollars ($ 750) or the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the 
unauthorized use, and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in 
computing the actual damages. In establishing such profits, the injured party or parties are required to present proof only of the 
gross revenue attributable to such use, and the person who violated this section is required to prove his or her deductible 
expenses. Punitive damages may also be awarded to the injured party or parties. The prevailing party in any action under this 
section shall also be entitled to attorney's fees and costs. "
274,," ""(d) For purposes of this section, a use of a name, . . . photograph, or likeness in connection with any news, public affairs, or 
sports broadcast or account, or any political campaign, shall not constitute a use for which consent is required under subdivision 
(a)."" "
275,6," The tort is variously known as interference with "" 'prospective economic advantage,' "" "" 'prospective contractual relations,' "" and 
"" 'prospective economic relations.' "" (Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 378.) "

289,1, This disposition is not designated for publication and may not be cited. 
290,2," Unless otherwise indicated, references to Rules hereinafter will refer to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
290,3," The Court will refer to the three motions respectively as: ""motion to dismiss;"" ""'anti-SLAPP' motion;"" and ""motion to strike."" KinderStart has moved for administrative relief relating to a minor delay in the submission of its opposition to the ""anti-SLAPP"" 
motion and motion to strike. The Court will grant this relief to the extent that it is not already moot. "
291,4," Google denies most, if not all, the allegations made against it by KinderStart, but denies with particular vehemence the 
allegation of its possession of discriminatory political or religious views. These allegations are one subject of a motion for Rule 
11 sanctions against KinderStart and its counsel, see Motion for Sanctions 5, which motion is addressed in a separate order filed 
concurrently herewith. "
294,5," This footnote references an antitrust textbook in which the author discusses situations in which the alleged antitrust violator has 
""overwhelming market [share], perhaps 80 or 90 percent."" "
295,6," The Court expresses no opinion as to the adequacy of KinderStart's pleading of the other four requirements for overcoming the 
de minimus presumption. "
296,7," The only specific allegation about Google's pricing policy or conduct relates to its creation of an auction system to allow 
advertisers to bid to place their advertisements. SAC P 64(a)."
296,8," KinderStart makes conclusory allegations that Google has denied access to an essential facility, SAC PP 219-21, and has 
refused to deal, SAC P 227, but it makes insufficient factual allegations to support such claims. "
297,9," See also SAC P 37 (""When AOL's market share based on the Engine in the Search Market is combined with Google's native 
market share derived from its own website, the Engine of Google is used in excess of 60% of all search queries among users 
within the Search Market in the U.S.""); SAC P 41 (""Dangerous probability of success in monopolizing the two relevant and 
related markets exists because Google' [sic] market shares is steadily rising and is in each market upward of 60% or more."")."
297,10," In contrast, KinderStart does not have standing to complain of harms done to third parties. "
298,11," The most relevant allegation in the SAC asserts: ""Defendant, through the maintenance, exercise and abuse of monopoly 
power, have [sic] forced Class I and Class II Plaintiffs to either surrender their business or to expend time and resources to find 
another means to secure Web traffic and reach and serve consumers."" SAC P 229. To the extent that Plaintiffs may still ""expend 
time and resources to find another means to secure Web traffic and reach and serve consumers,"" Google does not have the 
power to eliminate downstream competition. Google has no obligation to aid its alleged competitors, and the Court cannot 
relieve these alleged competitors of the effort required to compete in an apparently lucrative market."
298,12," KinderStart makes this argument following its discussion of Google's alleged monopoly power. To the extent that it contributes 
to KinderStart's overall claims for attempted monopolization and monopolization, it provides no support for other parts of 
KinderStart's argument, such as its argument that Google engaged in exclusionary conduct. "
299,13, The Court addresses Google's motion to strike the entire SAC below.
299,14," The Ninth Circuit cited Gordon & Breach Science Publishers v. American Inst. of Physics, 859 F.Supp. 1521 (S.D.N.Y.1994), 
adopted the test it set forth, and applied it to the case before it. "
300,15," KinderStart does not explain how its discussion of Google as a public forum connects with its state actor argument. See 
Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 22-25. KinderStart provides no authority indicating that success on its public forum arguments 
would render the state action inquiry unnecessary. Accordingly, the Court will consider the arguments regarding the public forum 
to the extent that they contribute to the dispositive issue in this claim: the presence of state action."
300,16," The Court explained in the July 13th Order that KinderStart had not met the public function, joint action or governmental 
compulsion/coercion tests. KinderStart has added no allegations in the SAC that would allow the Court to find state action on 
any of these bases. To the extent that KinderStart reasserts facts in the SAC that pertain to the public function, joint action, or 
government coercion/compulsion tests for state action, see SAC PP 110, 253, 255, the Court reaffirms its earlier conclusion that 
KinderStart's pleading is insufficient to meet any of the applicable tests."
300,17," Moreover, even if KinderStart had complained of actions associated with Google's relationship with state universities, the level 
of entwinement might not be sufficient to establish state action. In Brentwood, eighty-four percent of an ostensibly private 
association's members were public schools which ""largely provided for the Association's financial support"" and whose officials, 
acting in their official capacity, ""overwhelmingly perform[ed] all but the purely ministerial acts by which the Association exist[ed] 
and function[ed] in practical terms."" Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 299. In addition, the state appointed members to the association's 
governing body, and association employees participated in the state retirement system. Id. at 300. KinderStart's allegations fall 
far short of the level of ""entwinement"" with respect to finances, organization and personnel described in Brentwood. "
301,18," KinderStart cites National A-1 Advertising, Inc. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 121 F.Supp.2d 156, 179 (D. N.H. 2000), for the 
proposition that ""third party speech emanates through the return of a 'hit' by a search engine."" This appears to be a restatement 
of its first argument that a search engine is a public forum for speech because it allows web-users to access speech. However, 
National A-1 Advertising provides minimal support for KinderStart's argument. The case pertains to the registration of domain 
names and does not address the issues presented in this case. "
305,19," The term ""malice"" does not appear in the SAC. "
306,20, Google requests judicial notice of this printout and other web-page printouts. The Court will grant this request.
306,21," ""For this conditional privilege extends to false statements of fact, although the occasion may be abused and the protection of 
the privilege lost, by the publisher's lack of belief, or of reasonable grounds for belief, in the truth of the defamatory matter, by 
excessive publication, by a publication of defamatory matter for an improper purpose, or if the defamation goes beyond the 
group interest. Thus the privilege is lost if the publication is motivated by hatred or ill will toward plaintiff, or by any cause other 
than the desire to protect the interest for the protection of which the privilege is given."" Id. (citations omitted)."
306,22," Google cites no authority indicating that the Court may strike a claim from a superseded complaint. The Court need not 
address its power to do so because it will deny all aspects of the motion on other grounds. "
307,23," KinderStart has filed the declaration of Daniel D. Savage (""Savage""), a manager of TradeComet.com LLC. Savage asserts 
that a sudden increase in minimum bids for keywords under AdWords caused a dramatic drop in TradeComet.com's revenue. 
This single declaration of one other company does not transform the conduct in this case into a matter of public interest."
307,24," The Court is unpersuaded by Google's reference to the large traffic counts claimed by KinderStart in its SAC. The Court has 
explained elsewhere that the ""anti-SLAPP"" statute covers statements made in connection with a public issue, not statements 
that could have an impact on the public. Order Den. Special Mot. to Strike and Den. Req. for Att. Fees, Sherwood v. Wavecrest 
Corp., C 05-02354 (N.D.Cal., Nov. 1, 2005). The alleged volume of traffic that moved to other sites as a result of the conduct in 
question may indicate impact on the public, but it does not indicate that the conduct itself was a public issue. "
309,25," KinderStart's pending motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on May 26, 2006, is denied as moot. "
310,1, This disposition is not designated for publication and may not be cited.
310,2," Plaintiff, acting pro se, states that he is an attorney. "
311,3," The paragraphs were: ""95A. Google's anticompetitive activities as alleged are specifically intended to increase Google's income, profits and of the 
keyword-targeted internet advertising market, and to deprive competitors Yahoo, MSN and any others of income, profits and 
market share."" ""146A. Plaintiff is a consumer as to his candidacy and part-time book selling activities and, upon information and belief, many 
hundreds of thousands of AdWords advertisers during the past 3 years are also consumers in their Google advertising activities, 
including consumers who are (i) candidates for public office, (ii) offering unwanted personal goods for resale and/or (ii) [sic] 
retired or self employed persons, acting part-time, offering goods or services to supplement their income."" See Google Opposition to Motion for Leave to Amend Ex. B."
311,4," To the Court's knowledge, no single document exists that incorporates the amendments made to the complaint on August 3, 
2006. Since the amendments do not disrupt the numbering of paragraphs in the original complaint, the Court will cite to the FAC 
using the numbering of the original complaint and of the amendments."
311,5," The proposed complaint includes fifteen claims: (1) monopolizing and attempting to monopolize in violation of Sherman Act § 2; 
(2) denial of use of essential facility to competitor and denial of non-discriminatory use of AdWords in violation of Sherman Act § 
2; (3) conspiracy to fix prices and unreasonably restrain trade in violation of Sherman Act § 1; (4) violation of the California 
Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16720; (5) violation of the California Unfair Practices Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 
17000, et seq.; (6) violation of the New York Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340; (7) breach of contract; (8) rescission of 
contract; (9) reformation of contract; (10) violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a); 
(11) unfair competition in violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.; (12) false and misleading advertising in violation of "
312,," Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17500-09; (13) class action claims under California law; (14) deceptive acts and practices in violation 
of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 349, 349-c; and (15) false advertising in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 350, 350-e. "
316,6," Neither the breach of contract claim nor the reformation of contract claim identifies the law under which it is brought. Reading 
them in the context of the rest of the proposed complaint, the Court concludes that Plaintiff intended to bring them under 
California law."
316,7," For example, the proposed complaint includes the following two paragraphs that describe representations by Google: ""C. That Google was conducting a legitimate auction in which the highest bidder was able to obtain the best ad position; D. Impliedly, that Google was not manipulating the auction results through arbitrary, subjective evaluations of the Plaintiff's ad 
copy, website, or landing page to require the Plaintiff to bid 10, 20, 50 or 100 times the minimum price to be able to have the 
Plaintiff's ad run at all (in the least favorable position)."" Proposed Complaint PP 191 C-D. "
317,8," The proposed complaint splits the original claim under section two of the Sherman Act into two separate claims. If Plaintiff 
concludes that he must split his Sherman Act § 2 claims and assert one claim for attempted monopolization and another for 
monopolization, he may do so, thereby raising the total number of claims in the amended complaint to seven."
317,9," This restriction is ordered without prejudice to a future motion for leave to amend the complaint if Plaintiff is able to state a 
viable claim in an amended complaint."
317,10," The Court did not reach Google's argument that the entire proposed complaint would be subject to dismissal under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 8, but, if appropriate, it will consider a similar argument as to an amended complaint."
317,11," To the extent that Plaintiff's motion to file an amended complaint, filed on February 9, 2007, was not disposed of by the Court's 
order on February 13, 2007, that motion is denied. "
319,1," Unless otherwise denoted, all subsequent statutory citations arc to the California Code of Civil Procedure."
319,2," State law applies a five-day extension while the Federal Rules provide a three-day extension. As the rules would be in direct 
conflict, the three day extension applies in federal court. See Verizon, 377 F.3d at 1091 (holding that when procedural provision 
of the anti-SLAPP statute conflicts directly with a Federal Rule, the Federal Rule applies). "
321,3," Plaintiff does not delineate which of his arguments address the ""arising from"" prong of the analysis and which address the 
""prima facie merits"" prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. As Plaintiff is pro se, we construe his arguments liberally and apply them 
to the analysis in the manner most favorable to him. "
322,4," Plaintiff points out that he prevailed in the DLSE proceeding. But the privilege does not and cannot turn on the parties' ultimate 
success on the merits of the proceeding."
322,5," Despite the fact that in Silberg the California Supreme Court described the litigation privilege as ""absolute,"" see Silberg, 50 Cal. 
3d at 220, and that Court has held that the litigation privilege applies to claims for invasion of privacy, see Ribas v. Clark, 38 Cal. 
3d 355, 364, 212 Cal. Rptr. 143, 696 P.2d 637 (1985), there are a few court of appeal decisions holding that certain claims for 
invasion of privacy rights protected by the state constitution can overcome the litigation privilege. See Jeffrey H. v. Imai, Tadlock 
& Keeney, 85 Cal. App. 4th 345, 359, 101 Cal. Rptr. 2d 916 (2000); Urbaniak v. Newton, 226 Cal. App. 3d 1128, 1141, 277 Cal. 
Rptr. 354 (1991); Cutter v. Brownbridge, 183 Cal. App. 3d 836, 844, 228 Cal. Rptr. 545 (1986). Others courts have disagreed. 
See Jacob B. v. County of Shasta, 137 Cal. App. 4th 225, 40 Cal. Rptr. 3d 81 (2006); Wise v. Thrifty Payless, Inc, 83 Cal. App. 
4th 1296, 1303 n.1, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 437 (2000). The Supreme Court has granted review of a case addressing the issue. See 
Jacob B., 46 Cal. Rptr. 3d 605, 139 P.3d 1 (2006) (order granting review). Plaintiff does not press this point. Moreover, even if 
the cases holding the litigation privilege as nonabsolute in the face of a constitutional privacy claim are correctly decided, the 
decisions are distinguishable from the facts of this case. Each of these cases involved the defendants' purely voluntary 
submission of plaintiffs' private, but minimally relevant, matters to an official proceeding. In these cases, defendants' submission 
of the private materials was a matter of their own strategic choices. In contrast, in this case the file was affirmatively sought by 
the tribunal. Defendants were instructed in official correspondence to bring Plaintiff's personnel file to the conference before the 
Labor Commissioner. The fact that it was mailed to the Commissioner, as opposed to physically carried to the conference, is a 
distinction that warrants no difference. Because the Labor Commissioner required the file to be produced, Defendants are 
entitled to rely on that instruction in claiming the litigation privilege. Cf. Jeffrey H., 85 Cal. App. 4th at 360 (""[It is] clear that the 
litigation privilege applies when the disclosure is made pursuant to a judicial determination[.]""). "
323,6," Additionally, this claim appears to be legally insufficient because a claim for abuse of process cannot arise from the mere filing 
of a lawsuit. See [*14]  Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss & Karma, Inc., 42 Cal. 3d 1157, 1169, 232 Cal. 
Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202 (1986) (""[T]he mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit—even for an improper purpose—is not a proper 
basis for an abuse of process action."")."
323,7," El-Hakem v. BJY Inc., 415 F.3d 1068, 1073 (9th Cir. 2005) held a CEO jointly liable with a corporation under § 1981, but did 
not actually discuss the individual liability issue. "
325,8," Plaintiff has sought to file a summary judgment motion against the counterclaims, which we have denied as premature because 
discovery in the case has not been completed. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(2), (3) (providing the district court with authority to 
manage discovery and motion practice through the scheduling order). But a perusal of that motion does not plainly reveal that no 
""objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome[.]"" Amarel v. Connell, 102 
F.3d 1494, 1518 (9th Cir, 1996) (quoting Prof? Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60, 113 
S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993)). "
326,9," We further note that premature consideration of summary judgment motions, particularly those granted prior to the close of 
discovery, often leads to wasteful re-litigation of issues. See, e.g., Burlington N. Santa Fe, 323 F.3d at 774 (remanding for 
additional discovery and reconsideration of grant of early motion for summary judgment). "
330,1," Four separate complaints, filed as class actions, were consolidated under the Wilson v. General Motors caption."
330,2," The Wilson and Kaufman complaints do not expressly state ""causes of action [in] violation of N.J.S.A. 56:9-3,"" as do the 
Williams and Tatte complaints. However, the Wilson and Kaufman complaints allege that ""[d]efendants have engaged in unfair 
methods of competition in violation of the standards of conduct established by the New Jersey Antitrust Act, N.J.S.A. 56:9-1, et 
seq. The violation of this [A]ct constitutes unfair and unconscionable practices, which are actionable pursuant to the New Jersey 
Consumer Fraud Act 56:8-2."" According to the Wilson and Kaufman complaints: The contract, combination and conspiracy alleged herein was an unconscionable commercial practice prohibited by the 
New Jersey Fraud Statute and other state statutes prohibiting price fixing. The unconscionable commercial practice 
consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding and concert of action among the Defendants and their co-conspirators 
the substantial terms of which were to eliminate the import of new cars from Canada into the United States and thereby 
raise, fix, stabilize or maintain prices of new automobiles sold or leased in the State of New Jersey and throughout the 
United States at artificially high levels. "
341,1," A different question is presented if that fact appears after certification. Gen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 156."
341,2," Indeed, in rejecting then the defendants' challenge to the opening date of the class, I observed merely that the Fourth 
Amended Complaint ""is broad enough to permit proof that the conspiracy had begun earlier [than January 1, 2001] and thus that 
impact could have started January 2001. Whether that assertion can be proven will await summary judgment or trial."" May 12 
Order at 25 n.46 (citation omitted)."
341,3," Both sides urge upon me the make-or-break effect of a class certification (""an intense pressure is brought to bear upon the 
defendants with no judicial finding that any fact out there is so,"" Hr'g Tr. p. 66, Feb. 21, 2007 (defendants); ""So, you know, there 
is a flip side to his argument too, and that's why the courts that have considered class certification tend to urge certification, tend 
to lean in favor of certification because without it--and indeed the public policy surrounding Rule 23 recognizes that . . . without 
the device as the first step, the plaintiffs will never really ever be able to get their day in court,"" Id. pp. 85-86 (plaintiffs)). Certainly 
those generally recognized effects make me take very seriously the importance of the decision and reinforce my ordinary desire 
as a trial judge to ""get it right,"" but they cannot lead me in one direction or the other. That would be an unprincipled rule of law. "
342,4," Hall's rebuttal report actually says that without the ten percent calculation, the period of export profitability would have ended in 
May 2004 (suggesting an alternate class ending date of April 30, 2004 rather than January 2004). Rebuttal Expert Report of 
Prof. Robert E. Hall on the Timing of Profitability of Exporting New Vehicles from Canada to the United States (""Hall Rebuttal 
Rpt."") P 12 (Docket Item 475). Since the plaintiffs cite this paragraph of Hall's report as the basis for their January 2004 date, 
see Pls.' Reply Mem. at 6, I assume the January date is an error; but it is immaterial to my analysis because I accept the 
plaintiffs proposed ending date of April 30, 2003."
342,5," Dr. Hall's analysis is persuasive that price differentials at some level inspire cross-border arbitrage opportunities. Whether an 
illegal agreement halting Canadian imports (or removing their threat) produced antitrust causation or retail purchase price impact 
remains to be proven at trial or demonstrated at summary judgment. The question for me at certification, however, is not who will 
win the merits of that argument, but whether the plaintiffs' proof, adequate or inadequate, meets the tests of commonality, impact 
and predominance. I concluded in my May 12 Order that it does. As I also observed then, this is not the time to determine what 
vertical restraints the individual manufacturers maintained, their legality and their effect."
342,6," The commentators have said that HN2[
] the class definition should be precise, Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) §"
342,21," .222 (2004), and that is so, in order that people can determine whether they are class members. Id. But precise or not, the 
accuracy of the ending date cannot be confidently established at certification in a case where causation and impact may 
diminish as outside market forces (e.g., exchange rates) fluctuate. "
343,7,"  PolyMedica held that ""[t]he district court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings . . . in its resolution of the class-certification 
question."" In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 432 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2005). PolyMedica based that holding upon the statement 
from Tardiff that HN3[
] ""a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper 
on one premise but not another,"" Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2004); from Smilow that a ""district court must 
conduct a rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by Rule 23 before certifying a class,"" Smilow v. Southwestern Bell 
Mobile Sys., 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2003); from Mowbray that ""a district court must formulate some prediction as to how 
specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case,"" In re Waste 
Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 298 (1st Cir. 2000); and PolyMedica's preference for ""the majority view"" which 
it characterized as: ""a district court is not limited to the allegations raised in the complaint, and should instead make whatever 
legal and factual inquiries are necessary to an informed determination of the certification issues."" PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at 5. I do 
not read PolyMedica as mandating a particular level of factfinding by the district judge at the certification stage. First, under all 
the cited cases considerable discretion is left to the district judge. Second, what is appropriate for determining whether there is 
an efficient market in a securities case is quite different from market determinations, market behavior and market definitions for 
antitrust purposes. I continue to believe that I followed the teaching of PolyMedica correctly in examining the proof the plaintiffs 
will use and the defenses the defendants will raise. I have looked ""beyond the pleadings,"" ""test[ed] designated premises,"" 
""conduct[ed] a rigorous analysis of the [Rule 23] prerequisites,"" tried to predict ""how specific issues will play out,"" and made the 
inquiries I believe are necessary. See May 12 Order at 16-24. PolyMedica also counsels: Exercising its broad discretion, and understanding the correct definition [in PolyMedica, of an efficient market] and the 
factors relevant to that determination, the district court must evaluate the plaintiff's evidence of [in PolyMedica, an efficient 
market] critically without allowing the defendant to turn the class-certification proceeding into an unwieldy trial on the merits."
343,432, F. 3d at 17 (emphasis original).
343,8," There would also be some procedural unfairness in making an entirely new ruling on the record now. Magistrate Judge 
Kravchuk made perfectly clear as she arranged for discovery and briefing on the class-ending-date issue that she was not 
reopening my original May 12 decision. Rpt. of June 1, 2006 Disc. Conf. and Order, at 2 (Docket Item 369) (""[W]hile the court 
certainly wanted to hear from both sides regarding the economic analysis underlying the proposed 'closing date,' this briefing 
opportunity was not intended as a relitigation of the motion for class certification.""). If I were inclined now to reverse my ruling of 
May 12, in fairness I would have to allow the plaintiffs fulsome discovery on all the issues that the defendants have posed and 
give notice that the entire issue of damage class certification was up for reexamination. For the same reason, I do not resolve a 
computation controversy the specifics of which emerged just days before the hearing, a controversy that continues to develop. 
(On December 1, 2006, Dr. Kalt said that Dr. Hall wrongly interpreted certain data entries made by the Power Information 
Network, LLC, which compiles automobile pricing data for certain manufacturers, Kalt Rpt. at 24-25; Dr. Hall responded on 
December 15, 2006, that he had interpreted the data entries correctly, citing published articles, which I have examined. Hall 
Rebuttal Rpt. PP 15-16. Nothing further happened on the record until February 16, 2007, five days before the February 21, 
2007, oral argument, when the defendants filed an affidavit by a Power employee stating that Dr. Hall had misinterpreted the 
data entries. Decl. of Mike Murray (Docket Item 519). Clearly the plaintiffs were not in a position to respond to that late-filed "
344,," affidavit before the hearing; post-hearing briefing continues to develop the issue. I learned only yesterday from the defendants' 
reply memorandum that Power maintains different sets of data with different applicable glossaries. I am not in a position to 
resolve that controversy now.) "
345,9," Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994), is similar: ""Since the federal Evidence Rules governing 
hearsay and impeachment do not seek to displace the Health Act's policy of limiting frivolous malpractice suits, the federal rules 
[which the court did not enforce] and the state statute can peacefully coexist, each operating within its own sphere of influence."""
345,10," These states appear to be unlike Alabama, where HN10[
] the state supreme court has held that Alabama's ban on class 
actions in consumer cases extends to every other state's deceptive practices law if the lawsuit is in Alabama state court and has 
labeled the bar on class actions as a procedural bar. See O'Keefe v. Mercedes-Benz USA, 214 F.R.D. 266, 285 (E.D. Pa. 2003) 
(discussing Ex Parte Exxon Corp., 725 So. 2d 930 (Al. 1998))."
345,11," The states are: Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin."
345,12," At oral argument I expressed my concern that a class member would not be able to make an intelligent decision whether to 
opt out of the proposed settlement classes given the current state of proceedings, as well as my concern over the expense and 
confusion of several successive notices. "
352,1," Because this appeal comes to us following the granting of motions for judgment on the pleadings, which are equivalent to 
demurrers (Smiley v. Citibank (1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 146 [44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 441, 900 P.2d 690]), our statement of facts is based 
upon the allegations of the second amended complaint. “[W]e treat as true all material facts properly pleaded, but not 
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] However, we disregard allegations that are contrary to law or to 
facts that may be judicially noticed [citation] or are contradicted by the express terms of an exhibit incorporated into the 
complaint. [Citation.]” (Freeman v. San Diego Assn. of Realtors (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 171, 178, fn. 3 [91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 534].)"
352,2," The complaint alleges there are some physical therapists who are not members of PTPN who are preferred providers for Blue 
Cross “for idiosyncratic reasons”—e.g., some may have been “grandfathered” into their status as preferred providers, and some 
are affiliated with physician groups that are preferred providers."
352,3," For example, plaintiffs allege that Blue Cross subscribers may not be able to receive the physical therapy they need because 
some PTPN members have more patients than they can adequately serve and thus limit their appointments to 15 minutes rather 
than a full hour, or because the PTPN member practicing in the subscriber's location may not be qualified to provide certain 
specialized treatments. "
353,4," There were, in fact, several motions for judgment on the pleadings. PTPN and Blue Cross filed two motions, one asserting 
statutory authorization and the other asserting lack of antitrust injury, directed at the first amended complaint (plaintiffs filed the 
first amended complaint before serving the original complaint on either defendant). The trial court granted those motions with 
leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing minor revisions. Noting there was little difference 
between the first and second amended complaints, the trial court deemed the original motions for judgment on the pleadings to 
be motions directed to the second amended complaint, and allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs. The parties did so, 
and the court subsequently granted the motions without leave to amend and entered judgment against plaintiffs. "
354,5," The Legislature's reference to the creation of a “new product” is in response to the United States Supreme Court's ruling in 
Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society (1982) 457 U.S. 332 [73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466], to which the Legislature 
cited in Business and Professions Code section 16770, subdivision (e). In Maricopa, the Supreme Court held that groups of 
physicians who agreed to maximum fee schedules for reimbursement by insurance companies committed per se antitrust 
violations. The Supreme Court rejected the provider groups' reliance on Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS (1979) 441 U.S. 1 [60 L. 
Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551] for the proposition that their fee schedules involved price fixing only in a literal sense and did not 
constitute illegal price fixing. The court in Maricopa explained that in Broadcast Music, the blanket license that was offered was 
an entirely new product that was different from the product an individual composer could offer, whereas the provider groups in 
Maricopa were offering the same product—medical services—but simply were offering them at a fixed price. (Maricopa, supra, 
457 U.S. at pp. 355–357 [73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466].) By referring in the immunity statute to the provider groups as a 
“new product,” the Legislature emphasized that the formation of those groups to offer services at fixed prices would not 
constitute illegal price fixing."
354,6," Those regulations are found in title 28 of the California Code of Regulations, and include detailed requirements related to 
patient accessibility to services and geographic accessibility standards. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, §§ 1300.67.2, 
1300.67.2.1.) "
355,7," The statute defines “reasonable consideration” as “consideration in good faith of the terms of proposals for affiliation prior to 
the time that contracts for alternative rates of payment are entered into or renewed. A plan may specify the terms and conditions 
of affiliation to assure cost efficiency, qualification of providers, appropriate utilization of services, accessibility, convenience to 
persons who would receive the provider's services, and consistency with the plan's basic method of operation, but shall not 
exclude providers because of their category of license.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 1373.9, subd. (b)(1).)"
355,8," We note that a subscriber might be willing to pay the additional cost to be treated by a non-PTPN member if that physical 
therapist offered services that were sufficiently better or better suited for the subscriber. Thus, plaintiffs may still compete on the 
basis of quality or innovation. "
356,9," For example, if two or more groups each formed contracting units and agreed that only one group would negotiate with each 
insurer, that conduct could be subject to antitrust enforcement. There is no such conduct alleged in this case. "
357,10," In light of our holding that the immunity statute exempts PTPN's imposition of geographic restrictions on its members from 
antitrust enforcement, we need not address whether plaintiffs allege antitrust injury arising from those restrictions—i.e., whether 
the alleged territorial market allocation restrains competition in the relevant market, the negotiation to become a Blue Cross 
preferred provider. (See, e.g., Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. (1977) 429 U.S. 477, 489 [50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 
690] [antitrust plaintiff must establish “antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent 
and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the 
violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation”].) "
366,1," The ""undisputed facts"" as described by the defendants are as follows: "
367,," The undisputed facts show that the police officers were called by Clara Washington to the Appellees' residence because of 
a domestic problem. The undisputed facts show that there was a chair overturned in the kitchen. Officer Haupert took 
photographs of the chair. The undisputed facts show that Clara Washington told the police officers that Leon Washington 
had put his hands on her shoulders and scratched her. She told the police officers that she and Leon Washington had 
dashed juice on each other. The undisputed facts show that Leon Washington had several scratches on him. Officer 
Haupert took photographs of the scratches. Appellant's Opening Br. at 12."
367,2,"  Judge Manion, writing separately, argues that this court must accept the facts as set forth by the district court and therefore 
should not consider the photographs or the 911 transcript. Since the transcript of the 911 call was in fact considered by the 
district court, we address only the photographs. In Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1995), 
the Supreme Court affirmed this court's decision to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the appellants, police 
officers appealing the district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, asked this court to determine a 
question of sufficiency of the evidence. Id. at 313. The Court stated that HN12[
] ""[w]hen faced with an argument that the 
district court mistakenly identified clearly established law, the court of appeals can simply take, as given, the facts that the district 
court assumed when it denied summary judgment for that (purely legal) reason."" Id. at 319 (emphasis added). The appellate 
court is not required to accept the facts as described by the district court, although in most instances it is appropriate to do so. 
But, in cases, such as the present one, where the appellants are not asking the court to resolve factual disputes or determine 
whether the evidence is sufficient, it is appropriate for this court to look beyond the factual account of the district court to all 
undisputed evidence."
367,3," Incidentally, assuming arguendo that the photographs of the scratches on Leon Washington were sufficient to establish 
probable cause, the officers only would have had probable cause to arrest Clara Washington, since the photographs only 
support bodily injury suffered by her husband. "
372,1," See JES Props. Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43122 at 38 (plaintiff claimed its damages as the profits it would have made on 
housing developments; court found such damages too remote and speculative to represent an antitrust injury). "
373,2," Section 542.18 mirrors the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. As I previously noted, courts must use federal caselaw interpreting the 
Sherman Act for claims under the Florida Antitrust Act. The Eleventh Circuit, in interpreting the Sherman Act, has stated that ""Section One applies only to agreements between two or 
more businesses; it does not cover unilateral conduct."" Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla. v. Clear Channel Communs., 376 F.3d 1065, 
1071 (11th Cir. 2004). Furthermore, ""Even where a single firm's restraints directly affect prices and have the same economic effect as concerted action 
might have, there can be no liability under § 1 in the absence of agreement."" Id., citing Fisher v. City of Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 
266, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986). "

buildings, representing roughly 1% of the 3 million commercial buildings nationwide. Nat'l Ass'n of State Util. Consumer

382,2," The government is vague about the relevant geographical areas for these product markets, alleging that they are no broader 
than each metropolitan area and no more narrow than each individual building. SBC Compl. P 24. "
383,3," If defendants do not accomplish the divestiture within the periods prescribed, the proposed final judgments provide that the 
Court will appoint a trustee selected by the United States to effect the divestitures. Id. at 8-11. "
384,4," In the final tally, the proposed final judgments cover 383 buildings for the SBC-AT&T merger and 365 buildings for the Verizon-

387,6," Some senators refer to the amendments as Title II of the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act. When 
passed in its final form, however, Title II of the Act was renamed the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act. "
388,7," Senator Kohl also noted that the text of the pre-amended Tunney Act contained ""no standards governing how a court is to 
conduct this review."" Id. at 53616. "
391,8," In fact, an earlier version of the amendments would have required a ""reasonable belief, based on substantial evidence and 
reasoned analysis, to support the United States' conclusion that the consent judgment is in the public interest."" H.R. 1086, § 221 
(as reported in Senate out of committee). That this language was removed in the final bill indicates that no change to the 
standard of review was intended by Congress. This history thus indicates that Senator Kohl's statements better reflect statutory 
language that was omitted, rather than the Act that was passed. "
402,1," Plaintiffs had also named as defendants Charles Wright, the Union's former President and current Business Agent and Analyst, 
and the Steel Erection and Ornamental Iron Industry Advancement Fund. On March 29, 2005, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the 
Fund from the suit. On June 10, 2005, the court allowed Wright's motion to dismiss."
402,2," See Herbert R. Northrup & Augustus T. White, Subsidizing Contractors to Gain Employment: Construction Union ""Job 
Targeting"", 17 Berkeley J. Emp. & Lab. L. 62, 71 (1996)."
402,3," Plaintiffs also asserted state-law claims for tortious interference with advantageous contractual and economic relations (Counts 
V and VI), and violations of the Massachusetts Unfair Business Practices Act, G.L. c. 93A (Count VII). On February 6, 2006, the 
court dismissed the state-law claims as preempted by the LMRA. "
403,4," Section 9 of the CBA states that ""[i]t is agreed that the Working Dues Deduction of two percent (2%) of the total package plus 
.85 for a Market Recovery Program and .03 for the Political Action League will be withheld out of net pay for each and every 
hour paid."""
403,5, There is no dispute that the Union has exclusive control over the money deposited into the Fund.
403,6, The Act's provisions were recodified in 2002 as 40 U.S.C. §§ 3141-3144.
403,7," The motives that led to the passage of the Davis-Bacon Act in 1931 were not entirely benign. The chief sponsor of the Act, 
Representative Robert L. Bacon of New York, introduced the antecedent of Davis-Bacon in 1927 with the stated purpose of 
preventing the loss of local unionized construction jobs to black workers migrating from the South. The Act has been the target 
of several repeal efforts and has been suspended on at least four occasions by four different Presidents during national 
emergencies."
403,8," Davis-Bacon is supplemented by the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act of 1934, 18 U.S.C. § 874, which makes it a federal crime for 
an employer ""by force, intimidation, or threat . . . or by any other means whatsoever"" to induce any employee into making a 
kickback."
403,9," Michael Scheinkman, Running Out of Bounds: Over-Extending the Labor Antitrust Exemption in Clarett v. National Football 
League, 79 St. John's L. Rev. 733, 741 (2005). "
404,10," Congress passed the Clayton Act in response to the Supreme Court's decision in the Danbury Hatters' Case, Loewe v. Lawlor, 
208 U.S. 274, 28 S. Ct. 301, 52 L. Ed. 488, 5 Ohio L. Rep. 617 (1908). In Loewe, the Court held that the actions of the United 
Hatters Union in publicizing a secondary boycott constituted an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Act. Compounding 
the injury, the Court held that individual members of the union could be held liable for treble damages under section 7 of the 
Sherman Act."
404,11," In 1947, Congress enacted the Taft-Hartley Act, a package of amendments to the NLRA extending the Wagner-Connery Act 
prohibitions against unfair labor practices by employers to coercive union tactics such as jurisdictional strikes, secondary 
boycotts, and ""common situs"" picketing. The intent of the amendments was to redress a perceived imbalance of bargaining 
power between unions and employers and to crack down on corrupt practices by some labor leaders."
404,12," The nonstatutory labor exemption protects unions from legal restraints that would otherwise inhibit the collective bargaining 
process. See Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U.S. 231, 237, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1996) (collective bargaining 
agreements almost by definition are ""combinations in restraint of trade""). "
405,13," Plaintiffs rely on McDaniel v. Univ. of Chicago, 548 F.2d 689, 695 (7th Cir. 1977), for the proposition that the Davis-Bacon Act 
creates a private right of action. The Union, relying on United States v. Binghamton Constr. Co., 347 U.S. 171, 176-177, 74 S. 
Ct. 438, 98 L. Ed. 594 (1954), insists that only the Secretary of Labor can enforce the wage provisions of the Act, and in the 
specific instance of the Union's job targeting program, has declined to do so. Given the court's decision to allow summary 
judgment for the Union, this is not a matter that need be resolved, although I would be inclined to think that if there is a Davis-
Bacon private right of action, only an aggrieved union member would have standing to bring suit. Cf. NLRB v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. 
Workers, Local 48 (Kingston Constr.), 345 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2003). See also 64 Am. Jur. 2d Public Works and Contracts, § 
222 (2007) (warning practitioners that the Davis-Bacon Act does not as a rule confer a private right of action). "
406,14," As an alternative theory, plaintiffs allege that the Union is the instigator of a ""rimless wheel conspiracy"" with individual BTEA 
members. As plaintiffs envision it, the Union stands at the hub of a conspiratorial wheel with spokes radiating to the BTEA 
contractors on its perimeter. HN5[
] ""A rimless wheel conspiracy is one in which various defendants enter into separate 
agreements with a common defendant, but where the defendants have no connection with one another, other than the common 
defendant's involvement in each transaction."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 203 (4th Cir. 2002), citing Kotteakos v. 
United States, 328 U.S. 750, 755, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946). While the imagery of a spoked but rimless wheel is 
quite vivid, the object of the alleged ""rimless wheel"" conspiracy is no different than that of the horizontal conspiracy, and 
therefore no more a violation of the antitrust laws, whatever other laws might be implicated."
406,15," The Union argues that even if its conduct is not shielded by the statutory labor exemption, it falls within the nonstatutory 
exemption, which protects conduct conducive to the lawful functioning of the collective bargaining process. Brown, 518 U.S. at 
236. The Union correctly points out that the plaintiffs' argument in opposition, which relies on Mathiowetz Constr. Co. v. Minn. 
Dep't of Transp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3389, 2002 WL 334394 (D. Minn. Fed. 27, 2002), is somewhat shaky as Machiowetz 
relied on Mackey v. Nat'l Football League, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir. 1976), the holding of which the Supreme Court substantially 
undercut in Brown. See, e.g., Clarett v. Nat'l Football League, 369 F.3d 124, 133-134 & n.14 (2d Cir. 2004). Because the court 
agrees that the Union's activities with respect to the Fund are insulated from the antitrust laws by the statutory labor exemption, 
there is no need to decide definitively whether the nonstatutory exemption also applies (although the Union makes a persuasive 
case that it does). "
407,16," The court does not read the Complaint, despite its prolixity, to allege an alternative ""cease doing business"" violation of the 
LMRA. "
411,1," The Defendants point out that CEMG states these causes of action on information and belief only. Though it is true that CEMG 
avers its first three causes of action only on ""information and belief,"" see, e.g., SAC, PP 43, 47, this alone is not fatal to the 
complaint: Allegations of the circumstances of a fraud based on information and belief, which are commonplace and often a necessity 
in many litigation contexts, usually do not satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b), unless accompanied by a 
statement of the facts upon which the pleader's belief is founded, but the application of the rule may be relaxed as to "
412,," matters peculiarly within the opposing party's knowledge that the pleader is not privy to at the time the document is being 
drafted."
412,5," A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1298."
412,2," This necessarily implicates that title company, which is not a party to this lawsuit. The title company, potentially responsible 
party, is not identified. It is hard to understand how the Plaintiff has not ascertained the identity of the title company. "
414,3," A single act of misconduct may form the basis of a UCL suit. Madrid v. Perot Systems Corp., 130 Cal. App. 4th 440, 464, 30 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 210 (2005). "

Distributor's, Inc., Index No. 01-595; Roche v. Nature's [*7]  Best Group, Inc., Index No. 01-483; Peligrini v. Nature's Best Group, 
Inc., Index No. 01-484. (Compl. ¶ 45 n.1.) Plaintiffs Roche, Mascola, Amendolare, Artino, Gannon, and Stolfa (among others) 
came together in Roche, Index No. 01-483, and Plaintiff Milligan is a plaintiff in Baker, Index No. 01-595. (Def.'s Mem. of Law 3-
4.)"

Company, Inc., Index No. 04-21891 (Sup. Ct., Suffolk County, N.Y.); Roche v. Arnold Sales Company, Inc., Index No. 04-28898 
(Sup. Ct., Suffolk County, N.Y.). (Def.'s Mem. of Law 4-5.) "
424,3," The Court in Schwimmer went on to further illuminate the rationale behind creating standing ""boundaries"": Thus, it is recognized that treble damage actions, effective and attractive as they are in deterring violations of the federal 
antitrust laws, must have some boundaries. Consequently, the standing requirement is designed, in essence, to limit 
access to treble recovery to a target of the anticompetitive conduct. Thus, the standing rules exclude a non-target whose 
damages are more difficult to prove and, in all likelihood, highly speculative. Where, as here, the substantive law provides 
few 'bright lines' separating permissible from impermissible conduct, it is especially important to have clear standing rules in 
order to avoid abuses of the Clayton Act's private enforcement remedy. [*13] Schwimmer, 637 F.2d at 46-47. "
425,4," As set forth above, Defendant's bread products are given to Plaintiffs on a consignment basis, meaning that there is no 
middleman in terms of ownership. (Compl. ¶ 31). In other words, Plaintiffs pick up the bread products and deliver it that day; they 
do not take ownership and do not incur added costs. Thus, in this case, since there is no true middleman, the customers of the 
cash stores, for example, would be able to sue if they were trying to compete in some form."
425,5," Although not vital to deciding the antitrust issues in this case, it is worth noting that the purpose of our body of antitrust law, 
from the Sherman Act and onward, is to protect competition itself, and in turn, consumers. The goal has never been to prevent a 
competitor from earning less profits in the face of furious competition, and it is also not concerned with any one, specific 
competitor thriving or not. It is competition itself that the law seeks to insulate. See, e.g. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 
U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (relating that antitrust law is in place for ""the protection of competition, not 
competitors"")."
425,6," Like with the discriminatory pricing claim, it may be that the cash stores actually did suffer an antitrust injury. That issue, 
however, is not for this Court to decide. "
426,7," These counts are for breach of contract due to wrongful termination, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith 
and fair dealing, termination of distributorship on purely pretextual grounds, and tortious interference with business relations. "
430,8," As discussed in Section III, supra, Defendant does move to dismiss Gannon's wrongful termination claim on the basis of the 
Rooker-Feldman doctrine; however, that motion is DENIED. "
431,9," Cause of action 16 is a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing brought by Roche. Since Roche did not 
also bring a wrongful termination claim, Defendants did not seek to dismiss his implied covenant claim as duplicative; however, 
as held in Section IV, supra, Roche's sixteenth cause of action is dismissed pursuant to the abstention doctrine."
431,10," Plaintiffs, in their opposition papers, contend that the causes of action based on pretextual termination should stand because 
Defendant did not explain what valid reasons it had for terminating the agreements. The Court does not see the rationale of this 
statement. Whether a party lists the reasons for the termination is irrelevant in the context of these duplicative claims. Just as 
with the other redundant claims, the reasons for termination will be argued via the primary wrongful termination claims, with the 
ultimate decision resting on whether the breach was lawful because it was ""for cause,"" or whether the reasons offered by 
Defendant for the terminations were, in fact, pretextual and nothing more. "
432,11," As Defendant points out, the only ""interference"" that Plaintiffs mention is that by terminating their agreements, Defendant 
interfered with Plaintiffs' ability to sell and deliver Defendant's bread products to their customers. This fact does not constitute 
tortious interference, but merely termination of the agreement. "
435,1," An additional company, UCAR Carbon Company (""UCAR""), which is now known as GrafTech, was also named as a defendant 
in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (""Amended Complaint""). On March 8, 2004, this Court approved the 
settlement with UCAR."
435,2," The Court certified the following class: ""All persons (excluding federal government entities, defendants, and their respective 
parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) who purchased Bulk Extruded Graphite Products in the United States, directly from the 
defendants, their affiliates or subsidiaries, during the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1998."" Class Certification 
Order, No. 02-6030, April 4, 2006. "
437,3," Defendants also argue that the action is time barred because the plaintiffs filed suit more than four years after any alleged act 
of concealment occurred. However, the statute of limitations begins to run when ""the plaintiff knows, or should reasonably be 
expected to know, the concealed facts supporting the cause of action,"" Forbes, 228 F.3d at 487, not when the last act of 
concealment occurred. Defendants do not dispute that there exists a material issue of fact as to alleged acts of concealment 
before June 1997. (Def. Reply at 5.) "
438,4," Plaintiffs state, without direct evidentiary support, that Mr. Schoch only acquired a controlling stake in plaintiff corporation GMI 
in 2000. The record demonstrates that Mr. Schoch started a graphite machining company in 1978, which he sold to SGL Carbon 
LLC in 1997. As of 1998, Mr. Schoch owned a company named Mercury Machine and Tool, for which Mr. Shane also worked. 
The Court is not satisfied that defendants have established that Mr. Shoch and Mr. Shane worked for GMI before 2000. It would 
be unfair for this Court to impute Mr. Schoch's and Mr. Shane's pre-1997 suspicions, much less notice, of price fixing to GMI."
438,5," The plaintiffs in the private graphite electrode civil actions were steelmakers because graphite electrodes are used for certain 
types of steel production. "
442,1," The introductory paragraph recites that only ""Rhino Sports, Inc. moves to amend its answer."" However, considering that the 
attorneys for Rhino Sports, Inc. also represent John E. Shaffer and that the subsequent reply was filed on behalf of both 
defendants, the Court assumes Mr. Shaffer joins in the motion to amend. "
445,2," In addition, Sport Court's argument that Rhino's antitrust claim faces a high hurdle and is rarely successful, which Sport Court 
argues highlights the importance of requiring precise and accurate allegations, is insufficient to allow a finding that the antitrust 
claim cannot proceed as a matter of law at this stage of the proceedings. "

Willis). Plaintiffs' Opposition, In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 04-5184, Docket Entry No. 849, at 47, n. 52. "
482,1," All facts are taken from the allegations set forth in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (""FAC""), and the Exhibits attached 
thereto, as indicated herein."
482,2," As discussed in the Court's prior order, the OAG's policy is embodied in paragraph 9 of a comprehensive ""Incompatible 
Activities Statement,"" adopted pursuant to Cal. Gov't. Code § 19990. (See id. at ¶ 35, Ex. 2.) "
485,3," ""Public officials are immune from liability for section 1983 damages 'insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established 
statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'"" Settlegoode v. Portland Pub. Schs., 371 
F.3d 503, 512-513 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396, 102 S. Ct. 2727 (1982))."
485,4," Because it involves a threshold question of pure law, it is appropriate to consider Defendants' qualified immunity defense in this 
case in the context of a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Weisbuch v. County of Los Angeles, 119 F.3d 778, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 1997) 
(""It is illogical to say that something is a question of law, and that it is reviewed de novo, yet that it can never be decided on the 
pleadings."")"
485,5," It is clear to the Court that Plaintiffs cannot, by means of an additional opportunity for amendment, plead any facts concerning 
any speech and petitioning activities that would involve a matter of public concern. As both the original complaint and FAC make 
clear, Plaintiffs' ""petitioning"" activities were limited to the filing of the Greenberg malpractice action and various satellite matters. "
490,1," The order issued on November 28, 2006 contains a more detailed summary of the relevant facts of this case."
490,2," Plaintiff also argues in a footnote that he has standing as an advertiser. As discussed below, this argument, fails. "
494,3," Plaintiff is not, however, an ""active participant"" in the Bay Area newspaper advertising market. Apart from a handful of 
advertisements placed in the Chronicle by two limited liability companies in which plaintiff is a shareholder, plaintiff has not 
engaged in any advertising in Bay Area newspapers. A shareholder has no standing to assert a claim based on an injury to a 
corporation. See Shell Petroleum, N.V. v. Graves, 709 F.2d 593, 595 (9th Cir. 1983). Furthermore, in deposition plaintiff offered 
no more than a vague plan ""in my head"" to do some future advertising in Bay Area newspapers. See generally Scarborough 
Decl., Ex. A (Reilly Dep.) at 180-183. Plaintiff therefore does not have standing as a consumer of newspaper advertising space. "
496,1," Defendants concede that summary judgment is appropriate as to the statute of limitations affirmative defense. ""In light of Judge 
Edgar's prior ruling on defendants' motion for summary judgment as to two of the named plaintiffs under a statute of limitations 
theory, . . . defendants do not dispute that this affirmative defense is unavailable as to those plaintiffs who were employed by 
Tyson during the class period."" (Court File No. 201, Defendants' Consolidated Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions 
For Summary Judgment (""Def.'s Memo""), at 1, n.1)."
496,2," Discovery in this case is ongoing. The Court recently held a Management Conference in the case and set discovery deadlines. 
Even though discovery is not yet complete, no party has asked the Court to delay ruling on these motions pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 56(f)."
496,3," The Court will simply refer to the latest filed complaint as ""Complaint."" "
498,4," The Court notes the court in United Power Association, Inc. rejected Plaintiff's argument; however, it did not do so on the merits 
of the plaintiff's argument. Rather, it was because the equitable defenses were so closely intertwined with other issues the court 
did not feel summary judgment was appropriate."
498,5," Since the Court finds estoppel is not available as an affirmative defense in RICO actions, there is no need to address whether a 
genuine issue of material fact exists in this case with respect to such a defense. "
499,6," The Court notes in responding to Plaintiff's motion, Defendants made reference to the fact Judge Edgar had already held the 
scope of employment defense was available, and as such, the law of the case had been established on this issue. While it is 
true Judge Edgar had stated Tyson had a right to defend itself in such a manner, he never stated the individual defendants had 
such a right. See Court File No. 84, Memorandum and Order, at 13. Therefore, there had been no prior determination as to the 
availability of the defense to the individual defendants, and accordingly, no ""law of the case"" on this issue. "
508,1," In their reply brief, Plaintiffs indicate that they are not asserting First Amendment claims against SARAA. (Doc. No. 33, at 10.) 
Rather, it is Plaintiffs' position that denying Capital City's drivers the right to pray at HIA supports Plaintiffs' claims of intentional 
discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. "
509,2," The first two of Plaintiffs' three questions presented are (1) ""Does the [Municipal Authorities Act] deny Defendant SARAA the 
explicit power to issue an exclusive contract?"" and (2) ""Does the regulatory power of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission 
preempt the power of Defendant SARAA to regulate taxicab service at Harrisburg International Airport?"" The third (and last) 
question relates to Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim. "

519,7," The Defendants also presented an argument in opposition to Arkansas Carpenters' request for additional time, pursuant to 
Rule 56(f), to review certain documents produced by its Administrator. As discussed in note 5, supra, this request has since 
been withdrawn by Arkansas Carpenters. Therefore, because this issue is now moot, it is unnecessary to address the 
Defendants' response in opposition to this alternate relief. "
521,8," ""Although Defendants argue that it is not their burden to subpoena third parties to find evidence supporting a plaintiff's claim, 
see Def. Mem. at 5 n.6, it is not plaintiff's burden either at this time. Clearly, Indirect Purchasers will need, at the time of trial, to 
meet its burden of persuasion and proof…."""

conspiracy produced 'adverse, anti-competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets,' and evidence 'that 
the objects of and the conduct pursuant' to that conspiracy were illegal""). "

524,14," Indeed, as Defendants argue in Defs. Reply Memo. (see Defs.' Reply  [*42] Memo. at 2), the documents submitted as Exhibit 
""1"" to the Rosemergy Declaration, purportedly pharmacy records, do not reflect who, in fact, paid for the prescriptions identified 
in the records and, apparently, do not reflect payment for or reimbursement of payments for generic K-Dur. Thus, it is unclear 
what, if any, conclusions or ""reasonable inferences"" can be drawn from these documents."
524,15," ""On or about July 11, 2006 and again on August 21, 2006 (to attempt to address legibility issues with the original 
transmission), Mr. Youngdahl forwarded to me copies of these documents, including a cover memo dated April 11, 2001, near 
the outset of the litigation, which indicates, 'I am enclosing copies of the K-Dur claims reimbursed by the Arkansas Carpenters 
Health and Welfare Fund.' True and accurate copies of those documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 1, redacted to safeguard 
protected health information."" (Rosemergy Declaration, at 2, P 6)."
524,16," THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Wasn't Arkansas Carpenters, though, subject to an Order I entered a couple of weeks ago or 
whenever it was?"" MR. LIEVERMAN: ""I believe it was last July about providing their documents. That's correct your Honor. And 
they did provide everything in their possession. Unfortunately, they did not have any of the records showing reimbursement or 
payments for the drugs. Those were in the hands of the third party payers [sic]. They just could  [*44] not get cooperation from 
them. We finally subpoenaed them as -- co-leads subpoenaed them as a last effort to represent the interests of the named 
plaintiffs. I think as your Honor understands -- I think as all of us understand in an MDL you don't get to choose necessarily 
everyone on your side as co-leads. We have an obligation to act on behalf of all of the named plaintiffs. But when there is 
something that then harms the interests of the class, we have to try to resolve that. And we spoke with counsel for Arkansas 
Carpenters and he's agreed that in the interests of the class as a whole, it is better for them to withdraw their claim. So yes, 
there was an Order, and I believe they obeyed that Order, with the possible exception of the few pages demonstrating 
reimbursement that, as Mr. Rosemergy said, he believed, erroneous as it turned out, those had been provided. That was simply 
a mistake on our part and we apologize. But with that exception, what they had was turned over. What they didn't have was in 
the hands of the third-party payers [sic]. We subpoenaed it. Now having seen it, there is just nothing that makes this goes [sic] "
525,," forward as a practical matter. I don't want to turn  [*45] over confidential health information in violation of HIPA [sic] to the 
defendants, frankly."" (Hrg. Tr. at 14-15.)"
525,17," THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""First of all, you're saying they're still a named plaintiff in their own case?"" MR. LIEVERMAN: ""They 
are, but they want to withdraw that as well. It goes back to the documents."" THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Well, maybe I'm not 
understanding this. They want to withdraw entirely from the case?"" MR. LIEVERMAN: ""Yes."" THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Do they 
want to remain a member of the class?"" MR.  [*49] LIEVERMAN: ""They'd like to remain a member of the class although, frankly, 
it will be difficult for them to file a proof of claim when the case is settled because of the way in which they now keep their 
documents. As I tried to describe in my letter -- and I think you got a flavor of it in the exhibit to Mr. Rosemergy's declaration. 
There is no rhyme or reason to these records. There are 68 boxes of medical receipts from doctors, from pharmacies, from 
hospitals and they got stamps on them that show they've been reimbursed, although I don't think the stamps says that. And 
they're stuck in boxes randomly. To produce those to Mr. -- to defendants right now, the boxes we've looked through, would 
require a page-by-page review by our lawyers and a redaction of the protected health information as required by HIPA [sic], 
federal regulations. That is a monumental undertaking and one that doesn't advance anyone's interests, including Arkansas 
Carpenters at this point. On that basis alone there is really no reason to have their case go forward at all. That is why, now that 
we've had the chance to look at the documents, I wrote the letter and said we don't need the extra time. We've looked through 
 [*50] it and we know that really -- out of fairness to all the parties as well as to the class, the claims of Arkansas Carpenters are 
actually going to impede the claims of the class."" (Hrg. Tr. at 12-14.) "
526,18," THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Let me ask you a question?"" MR. LIEVERMAN: ""Yes."" THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Let's assume I 
would allow them to remain in the class. Where does this problem get solved? What you're telling me is that their records are 
virtually impossible to put together; that it requires, you know, a page-by-page analysis. Even if the class were to be certified -- 
MR. LIEVERMAN: ""Correct."" THE SPECIAL MASTER: -- you, yourself, have conceded that they would have difficulty preparing 
and filing a proof of claim."" MR. LIEVERMAN: ""From what I've seen, that's correct. Now, they may find -- that they may have 
records, depending on the class period. They may have certain records that are good enough that they can file a competent 
proof of claim and get some money back. I don't think so, frankly, from what I've seen. But I'm just a little loathe to, you know, 
foreclose them from filing any proof of claim later on."" (Hrg. Tr. at 16.) "
530,1," On November 1, 2006, Robert E. Cooper, Jr., was sworn in as the Attorney General for the State of Tennessee."
530,2," On the Appellants' remaining claim--Tennessee's enforcement of a recent amendment to its tobacco legislation had an 
impermissible retroactive effect--the district court granted partial summary judgment to both parties. S&M Brands, Inc. v. 
Summers, 420 F. Supp. 2d 840 (M.D. Tenn. 2006); S&M Brands, Inc. v. Summers, No. 05-171, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31138, 
2005 WL 3160869 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 28, 2005). They have sought review of the ruling in a separate set of appeals. S&M Brands 
v. Summers, Nos. 06-5828/5829. Accordingly, the Appellants' retroactivity claim is not before us today in this appeal."
530,3, These claims are separate from the retroactivity claim. See supra note 2. 
537,1," Initially, Olde Monmouth also sought a preliminary injunction restraining DTC from its allegedly tortious communications with 
Olde Monmouth's clients. After defendants agreed not to initiate any further unsolicited communications with clients about Olde 
Monmouth's fees, plaintiff withdrew this request for preliminary injunctive relief. In consequence, Olde Monmouth's present 
motion for a preliminary injunction depends entirely upon the viability of its antitrust claims."
537,2," Defendant DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of defendant DTCC. Both defendants are incorporated under the laws of the state 
of New York with their principal place of business located in New York City."
537,3, Olde Monmouth is incorporated under the laws of New Jersey with its principal place of business located in New Jersey. 
538,4," A stop on physical processing is known in the industry as ""chilling"" the issue. "
539,5," As noted above, Olde Monmouth initially also moved for a preliminary injunction to restrain DTC from further allegedly tortious 
communications with Olde Monmouth's clients and potential clients, but plaintiff withdrew this request after an agreement was 
reached between the parties. "
540,6," In addition, stock transfer agents must be registered with the SEC pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78q-1(c). Olde Monmouth has not 
alleged that DTC is registered, or has sought to register, as a transfer agent with the SEC."
540,7," In Official Airline Guides, the Second Circuit also rejected the FTC's suggestion that ""if the only supermarket in town decides to 
stock Birdseye vegetables but not Green Giant vegetables, the FTC would be able to require it to stock Green Giant vegetables 
if it were to find Green Giant competitively disadvantaged."" Id. at 927. Rather, it concluded that ""even a monopolist"" had the right 
to exercise its discretion as to the parties with whom it would deal, so long as it ""had no purpose to restrain competition or to 
enhance or expand [its] monopoly."" Id. at 927-28. "
541,8," For example, plaintiff has not attempted to formally pierce the corporate veil of DTC."
541,9," Plaintiff's reply papers contain additional allegations based on the historical development of the DRS program. Specifically, Dr. 
Susanne Trimbath, a former DTC employee now employed as the Chief Executive Manager and Chief Economist of STP 
Advisory Services, LLC, submits an affidavit on behalf of Olde Monmouth which discusses a proposal presented by the transfer 
agent industry fifteen years ago that would have expanded their business into the market for securities intermediaries (the 
market for providing direct services to consumers for the purchase and sale of stock), and argues that DTC developed the DRS 
program to compete with the transfer agents' proposal. See Trimbath Decl. I do not consider Dr. Trimbath's allegations because 
they involve completely new facts and legal theories from those asserted in the complaint. First, the complaint challenges Olde 
Monmouth's exclusion from the FAST program--not DTC's original development of the DRS program. (Thus, the relief sought by 
Olde Monmouth is admission to the FAST program, not the dismantling of DRS.) Second, the historical background discussed 
by Dr. Trimbath is not relevant to the current market for transfer agent services. The proposal advanced by the transfer agent 
industry fifteen years ago was not adopted. There is no indication in the complaint that the transfer agent industry presently 
involves direct services to consumers for purchase and sale of stock, or that Olde Monmouth engages in such services. See 
Compl. P 13 (describing how plaintiff acts as an intermediary between its clients and DTC and maintains records of the 
ownership of its customers' shares of stock). Thus, the historical background presented in plaintiff's reply papers does not speak 
to whether DTC competes in the relevant market identified in the complaint."
541,10," Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985). "
542,11," Troster's speculation that DTC might enter the relevant market is completely insufficient to show a ""dangerous probability"" of 
monopolization. HN9[
] That factor is usually assessed by the defendant's current market share--not by the possibility that the 
defendant might enter the market. See, e.g., H.L. Hayden Co. v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 879 F.2d 1005, 1017 (2d Cir. 1989) 
(40 market share between two alleged conspirators, in the context of a widely diversified and competitive market, insufficient to 
demonstrate ""dangerous probability of success""). Cf. A.I.B. Express, 358 F. Supp. 2d at 251 (allegation in complaint that 
defendant ""will simply take over"" the other market sufficient to withstand motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim based on monopoly 
leveraging). Olde Monmouth's complaint nowhere alleges that DTC has plans to enter the other market of transfer agency 
services, let alone that it will ""take over"" that market. "
543,12," HN11[
] courts have recognized that the New Jersey state antitrust statutes ""shall be construed in harmony with ruling 
judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes"" and that New Jersey ""look[s] to federal jurisprudence to guide 
our interpretation of the [New Jersey Antitrust] Act."" Patel v. Soriano, 369 N.J. Super. 192, 848 A.2d 803, 826 (N.J. App. Div. 
2004) (citations omitted). Thus, Olde Monmouth's New Jersey monopolization claims fail for the same reasons the federal claims 
fail."
543,13," In its reply brief, plaintiff suggests that ""it hardly strains credulity to suspect that Defendants' own shareholder/owner 
Participants with DRS-approved transfer agency facilities might well have conspired with Defendants improperly to apportion 
unto themselves an ever increasing share of the market for transfer agency services . . . ."" Pl.'s Reply Br. at 18. I do not consider 
this speculated conspiracy--between DTC and major transfer agents--because it is completely different from the conspiracy 
theory alleged in the complaint--between DTC and Olde Monmouth's clients. And as explained above, ""the Complaint cannot be 
amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."" Lazaro v. Good Samaritan Hosp., 54 F. Supp. 2d 180, 184 
(S.D.N.Y. 1999) (citation omitted)."
543,14," As described supra n.12, the New Jersey antitrust statutes are construed in accordance with the comparable federal antitrust 
statutes. Thus, Olde Monmouth's New Jersey claim fails for the same reason the federal claim under Section 1 fails. "
544,15," endants' submissions assert that Olde Monmouth instituted exorbitant fee increases--such that the charge for a single 
withdrawal by transfer increased from $35 to $700--and that DTC's communications with Olde Monmouth's customers were 
entirely reasonable under these circumstances. Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 9-10. Although plaintiff does not appear to dispute the 
magnitude of the fee increases, I do not presently address the justifications asserted by DTC because a motion to dismiss deals 
only with the sufficiency of the complaint. "
550,1," Claims of conspiracy in violation of the above referenced federal and state statutes are all contained in Count I of the 
complaint. Counts II and III of the complaint are vaguely worded accusations of ""misrepresentation,"" and do not set forth any 
clearly discernible causes of action. While Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 requires only a ""short and plain statement of the claim"" and ""simple, 
concise, and direct"" allegations, Counts II and III fail to satisfy even these minimal requirements and do not provide Defendants 
with fair notice of their alleged misconduct in order to prepare an appropriate responsive pleading. Accordingly, the Court will not 
consider Counts II and III in its ruling  [**3] on the instant motions to dismiss. "
551,2," The complaint's ""Statement of Fact"" consists chiefly of legal citations and conclusions of law and very little in the way of factual 
detail. The few factual allegations provided by Plaintiffs are summarized herein and are presumed to be true for purposes of the 
instant motion only."
551,3," The Court finds that Plaintiff has not stated a discernible medical malpractice claim. Consequently, the Court will not discuss 
this argument by the Semmes-Murphey Defendants. "
552,4," Given that the motions to dismiss of the Medtronic and Semmes-Murphey Defendants are virtually identical, the Court will treat 
the two motions as one for the purposes  [**9] of this order and will hereinafter refer to the two groups of defendants collectively 
as ""Defendants."""
552,5," The complaint also seeks $ 2 million for Plaintiff Gwendolyn Roberson's injuries, although the complaint contains no additional 
mention of Ms. Roberson, her involvement in the case, or the nature of her injury. "
555,6," In the February 1, 2007 status conference, Plaintiffs' counsel stipulated that its presentation in that hearing was to serve as 
response to Defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs' counsel did not respond to Defendants' statute of limitations/repose 
assertions in that hearing."
555,7," Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-18-109 is the provision of the TCPA providing for a private cause of action for unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices. Although not specifically mentioned in the complaint, it is the provision under which Plaintiff presumably makes her 
TCPA claim. "
589,*," The Honorable Karl S. Forester, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation. "
590,1," Dodge is yet another subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, AG."
590,2," DC Vans strenuously maintains that it does not distribute, nor has it ever distributed, the Dodge Sprinter van. Appellee's Br. at 
3 (""The only motor vehicle that DC Vans has ever distributed is the Freightliner Sprinter van."") (emphasis added). HN1[
] When reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, however, we must accept the plaintiff's allegations as true even if the defendant 
vehemently denies such allegations. Here, FOK alleges that DC Vans distributed not just the Freightliner Sprinter, but also the 
Dodge Sprinter. See Amended Compl. PP 53, 114-21. "
591,3," This is not to say that other forms of relief that are based on differences between the terms offered to respective dealers and 
that find their source outside the contract, such as FOK's Robinson-Patman Act claim, are necessarily precluded by the retail 
agreement. Unlike other such forms of statutory relief, however, the TTPA incorporates the retail agreement by reference, and 
by so doing would appear to render unavailable a claim based on changed competitive circumstances to the agreement where 
the agreement itself provides such rights to the supplier. "
592,4," Nowhere in FOK's original or amended complaint is § 13(a) even mentioned, and Count XI--which outlines the RPA claims--
refers exclusively to §§ 13(d) and (e). Thus, to the extent that FOK now argues that its complaint should be construed so as to 
encompass alleged § 13(a) violations as well, Appellant's Br. at 21-23, this argument comes too late. See Clark v. National 
Travelers Life Ins. Co., 518 F.2d 1167, 1169 (6th Cir. 1975) (HN9[
] ""[T]here is no duty on the part of the trial court or the 
appellate court to create a claim which appellant has not spelled out in his pleading."") (internal quotation marks and parentheses 
omitted). "
595,5," We note that this Court's Bouldis decision, on which both the district court and DC Vans so heavily rely in rejecting FOK's 
claims under the RPA, was decided at the summary judgment stage, not the 12(b)(6) stage. There, a determination of which 
practices were ""incident to the original sale"" versus ""incident to the subsequent resale"" of a product was only made after the 
parties had ""engaged in extensive discovery, including interrogatories, requests for documents and depositions."" 711 F.2d at 
1323. Only after discovery was the district court in Bouldis able to discern the true relationship between distributor, retailer, and 
consumer, and thus only after discovery was the court able to state with confidence that the plaintiff's §§ 13(d) and (e) claims 
were meritless. Id. at 1328-29. "
605,1," See USS-POSCO Indus. v. Contra Costa County Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 31 F.3d 800, 811 (9th Cir. 1994) (""HN14[

When dealing with a series of lawsuits, the question is not whether any one of them has merit - some may turn out to, just as a 
matter of chance - but whether they are brought pursuant to a policy of starting legal proceedings without regard to the merits

633,1," Lexmark has not always used this exact wording but has used a close estimation of it. [See, R. 573 at 3]. "
635,2," The focus group was never told which printer cartridge company sponsored the focus group. Many of them assumed that HP 
was sponsoring the group, and they were never informed otherwise. [R. 622, attach. B at 6]. "
637,3, The Court notes that it has already addressed the related issue of patent validity. [R. 1008].
637,4," The Court notes, however, that the issue of holding patents will come up again in this Opinion, at which point it becomes a valid 
reason for granting summary judgment on the discrete issue of a per se tying agreement. In order to avoid confusion, the Court 
has not delved into that discussion at this point. "
638,5," The Court notes that in Kodak, the parts market was a tying market whereas the service market was a tied market. To clarify 
the terms, in the patent context, a tying product is the patented product, and the secondarily purchased product is a tied product. 
See Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 1284, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) (""This presumption of 
market power, applicable in the antitrust context when a seller conditions its sale of a patented product (the ""tying"" product) on 
the purchase of a second product (the ""tied"" product), has its foundation in the judicially created patent misuse doctrine."" (citing 
United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 83 S. Ct. 97, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11, (1962))). "
647,6," The Court notes that Lexmark identifies these kits as labels. In order to avoid confusing the general cartridge packaging from 
the cartridge itself from the cartridge packaged within a kit, the use of word label will be used when referring to the actual 
packaging of all cartridges and the word cartridge kit will be used when referring to the sale of cartridges in conjunction with 
various other parts. "
648,7," The Court notes that both parties seem to imply that their positions rest on the single-use restriction being only within the 
context of a patent license. "
652,1," Plaintiffs also moved to strike Defendants' reply for being in violation of Local Rule 7.1(c) and this Court's order of November 
 [*2] 8, 2004 (Docket # 153). Defendants opposed Plaintiffs' request (Docket # 164). The Court will not strike Defendants' reply 
which is ten pages in length (Docket # 136). However, the Court will strike Defendants' supplemental reply which is forty-seven 
pages long (Docket # 136 - Attachment # 1). Defendants also moved to strike several declarations under perjury and expert 
reports submitted by Plaintiffs (Dockets ## 137, 138 & 145). Because our ruling on these motions does not alter our disposition 
of the case, we will DENY Defendants' various motions to strike. However, this does not mean that these documents will 
automatically be given the weight that Plaintiffs intended. There are some defects in these documents that are worth noting. "
653,," First, ""[a]n expert's opinion that lacks any credible support does not create an issue of fact."" Am. Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 
762 F. 2d 1569, 1580 (11th Cir. 1985) (citing Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 569 F.2d 666, 673 
n. 27 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). Moreover, with respect to Mr. Mukamal's statement under penalty of perjury, we note that ""[c]onstruction 
of a relevant economic market or a showing of monopoly power in that market cannot, however,  [*3] be based upon lay opinion 
testimony."" Id. (citing Forro Precision, Inc. v. Internat'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 673 F.2d 1045, 1059 (9th Cir. 1982)). Therefore, to the 
extent that Mr. Mukamal's contentions are based on his lay opinion, they are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact 
precluding the entry of summary judgment. Finally, Mr. Mukamal's second declaration, which is signed, is subscribed to as 
""Joseph J. Maximal."" Furthermore, Appendixes I and II to Plaintiffs' expert's reply report (Docket # 153) are in Spanish. 
Therefore, the Court cannot consider them. Local Rule 10(b). In addition, the Court notes that, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, 
the expert's report was never amended to include her signature, or, at least, the Court has not been able to locate said alleged 
correction within Plaintiffs' submitted compiled exhibits."

State (Docket # 79, P 10). Per the information provided by Defendants, PMC owns a chain of pharmacies known as El Amal and 
Mr. Saleh Yassin is its Chief Executive Officer (Docket # 108 n. 4)."
653,5," Joseph J.  [*5] Mukamal is the sole shareholder of both RPM and PRPI (Docket # 79, PP 4-5). "
655,6, Formerly codified at Local Rule 311(12).
655,7," Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss (Docket # 105), which Plaintiffs opposed (Docket # 114). Given the fact that the 
parties have already engaged in discovery and that Plaintiffs sought to convert the motion to dismiss to one for summary 
judgment, we only consider in this Opinion Defendants'  [*14] motion for summary judgement. Furthermore, since we are 
granting said motion, Defendants' motion to dismiss (Docket # 105) and all related pending motions (Dockets ## 113 & 153A) 
are hereby deemed as MOOT. In addition, Plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery (Docket # 90), to change the discovery 
schedule (Docket # 91), and Plaintiffs' motion submitting sworn statement in support of both motions (Docket # 125), as well as 
Defendants' motion to strike the reply to its opposition (Docket # 100) and Defendants' motion to strike the motion submitting 
sworn statement (Docket # 128) and its opposition (Docket # 133) are also deemed as MOOT. We note that the discovery 
requested in Plaintiffs' motion to compel, to wit, financial data for El Amal, even if granted, would not affect our decision as set 
forth in this Opinion. "
656,8," Defendants reject the existence of an exclusive dealing agreement. To that effect, they have submitted the lease agreement 
circumscribed by PMC (El Amal) and Five Development. (Docket # 109, Exhibit 11). Upon review, we find that there is no 
exclusivity clause regarding the operation of a single pharmacy at the Villa Fontana Shopping Center. Instead, the agreement 
precludes PMC from opening additional El Amal pharmacies within a one mile radius from the mall. Moreover, the agreement 
states that ""all of the agreements made are written in this contract, that no other additional agreements exist, and that any 
changes should be realized in writing and signed by both parties."" Nonetheless, we do not reach the ultimate conclusion 
proposed by Plaintiffs nor do we find that we need to."
656,9," At this point, we have to address Plaintiffs' contention that it is for the jury to determine what area comprises the relevant 
geographic market in any particular case. Having reviewed the relevant precedents, we differ from Plaintiffs' understanding. For 
example, in Double D Spotting Serv., Inc. v. Supervalu, Inc., 136 F.3d 554 (8th Cir. 1998), the Eight Circuit affirmed the district 
court's grant of the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs' alleged geographic market was 
too narrow to support an antitrust claim. Noticeably, in said case, the plaintiffs averred that the relevant geographic market was "
657,," the Supervalu warehouse in Urbandale, Iowa. The plaintiffs in Double D Spotting Service, Inc. challenged a contract between 
the owner of one particular warehouse within the Des Moines metropolitan area and one unloading service provider. The 
contract gave the unloading  [*19] service provider all of the unloading services at that particular warehouse. The Eighth Circuit 
found that ""the market for unloading services would seem to be more properly defined as including all warehouses within, at 
least, the entire Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area, if not an even larger area."" Id. at 560-61."
657,10," Ironically, Plaintiffs' expert also concluded that the Department of Health's criteria of a one mile radius was too narrow to 
analyze real competition in the market (Docket # 153, Exhibit 4, pp. 199-200). "
658,11, The P.R. Department of Health's studies are limited to a one mile radius. 
659,12," The First Circuit also pointed out that the plaintiff would not be able to provide her services at a neighboring municipality since 
the doctors she serviced did not have any privileges there."
659,13," Perhaps if Plaintiffs wanted to track the First Circuit's case and insist on the importance of parking spaces, they should have 
alleged a wider market, such as all the shopping centers in Carolina, if applicable."
659,14," Plaintiffs limited their search for new venues to a 500 meters radius in order to avoid having to obtain a  [*28] new CNC 
(Docket # 118, SUF # 30). Per Defendants' statement of uncontested facts, there are nine (9) shopping strip malls in addition to 
other commercial leaseable space in the area between 65th Infantry Ave., Sanchez Osorio Ave. and Monserrate Ave. in 
Carolina, approximately one mile radius from the Villa Fontana Shopping Mall (Docket # 109, SUF # 5). Plaintiffs have countered 
asserting that of those nine (9) centers, two have El Amal pharmacies (Docket # 118, PP 3- 4). However, this does not mean 
that Plaintiffs are foreclosed from obtaining a location, as evidenced by the fact that Plaintiffs have moved to a new location 
which contains five (5) parking spaces (Docket # 118, Exhibit 3, p. 5)."
659,15," See, e.g., Deauville Corp. v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., 756 F.2d 1183 (5th Cir. 1985) (finding that the plaintiff had failed to 
show that the exclusive lease agreement with the anchor tenant adversely affected competition since it failed to show that 
competition  [*30] from alternative mall sites was precluded); Child World, Inc. v. S. Towne Ctr., Ltd., 634 F. Supp. 1121 (S.D. 
Ohio 1986)(upholding restrictive covenant in shopping center); Optivision, Inc. v. Syracuse Shopping Ctr. Assocs., 472 F. Supp. 
665 (N.D.N.Y. 1979) (""The availability of such market alternatives is an important factor that supports a determination that the 
exclusivity clause here does not unreasonably restrain competition.""); Goodman v. Acme Markets, Inc., 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
4260, 1989 WL 42484 (E.D. Pa. 1989)(""A restrictive covenant which excludes the sale of grocery items within one-half mile of 
the Acme does not substantially affect the market for grocery items.""). "
660,16," El Amal leases at Villa Fontana Shopping Center over five times the amount of space which RPM leased (Docket # 118, SUF 
# 37). "
666,1," The Court has previously held that by virtue of the shift to corporate agency, Mr. Moore cannot assert any rights under the 1982 
individual agency agreement. See Moore v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 03-2390, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75439, 2006 
WL 2925445 (E.D. La. Oct. 10, 2006). "
667,2," The issue of whether State Farm breached its AA4 Inc. agency contract with Moore by implementing the LSA program appears 
to have been fully and finally litigated in California state court. See Patricia Adkins Ins. Agency, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. 
Co., 146 Cal. App. 4th 526, 52 Cal. Rptr. 3d 882 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007) (finding that the LSA program breached the AA4 
agreement), petition for review denied, 2007 Cal. LEXIS 4071 (Cal. Apr. 18, 2007). However, until the preclusive effect, if any, of 
the Adkins case on the claims in the instant litigation can be determined, the Court will defer consideration of several outstanding 
motions that address issues of liability filed by parties that were litigants in the Adkins case."
667,3," However, Moore's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress upon the corporate agency was dismissed. "
668,4," However, the Court struck that portion of the first paragraph of the Third Amended Complaint which sought to add as party 
defendants unspecified State Farm subsidiaries."
668,5," Specifically, the Court defers ruling on the following motions: Rec. Doc. 338, Rec. Doc. 345, Rec. Doc. 359, Rec. Doc. 382, 
Rec. Doc. 396, Rec. Doc. 413, Rec. Doc. 431, Rec. Doc. 459, and Rec. Doc. 490. "
669,6," To be consistent, the Court will continue to refer to the relief requested in Moore's motion alphabetically by paragraph. To be 
precise, Moore requests relief in various subparagraphs of section XXVII of his motion."
669,7," Judge Livaudais denied Moore's remaining requests for relief in Paragraphs B, D, E, F, and G of his motion by granting State 
Farm's motion to strike. These rulings have not been challenged and remain in place. "
670,8," Despite these allegations, Moore did not name Fortis as a defendant in the Amended and Restated Complaint. However, Fortis 
was named in the Third Amended Complaint, which incorporated all prior allegations by reference. Accordingly, the Court 
addresses Moore's claims against Fortis in Count 11 on their merits. "
671,9," In denying Fortis' earlier motion to dismiss, the Court did not specifically address the breach of contract allegations in Count 16, 
focusing instead on Moore's antitrust allegations. See Order and Reasons dated March 15, 2006, at 6 (Rec. Doc. 222). 
However, because Moore has never alleged the existence of a contract with Fortis (indeed the original Fortis appointment is 
alleged to have been made without Moore's knowledge or consent), the Court finds that the breach of contract claim against 
Fortis in Count 16 also fails as a matter of law. "
672,10," The Plaintiffs make an ancillary claim for damages as well, seeking reimbursement of past and future expenses associated 
with the defense of such claims. "
673,11," Thus, the Court need not address whether or not State Farm's allegations relate to the provision of professional services. "
680,1," DSM Elastomers Holding Company, Inc., DSM Elastomers, Inc. and DSM Elastomers Americas were originally parties to this 
action. By stipulation filed May 20, 2004, Plaintiff dismissed these three entities and substituted DSM Copolymer, Inc. (Notice of 
Dismissal Without Prejudice and Stipulation Re: Tolling and Acceptance of Service 1-2.) DSM Copolymer, Inc. and DSM 
Elastomers Europe, B.V. are the only DSM-related parties currently involved as defendants in this action. "
682,2," Indirect purchaser causes of action are generally based upon claims that the defendants conspired to fix prices in violation of 
the antitrust laws. They are indirect in the sense that the plaintiff did not purchase the price-fixed product directly from a 
defendant but rather purchased the product further down in the distribution chain or purchased a product in which the price-fixed 
product was either used as a component or consumed in the manufacturing process. "
687,3," This is similar to the ""loss causation"" requirement found in the federal securities laws, which itself is rooted in the common law 
of torts. See, e.g., Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (noting ""Congress' intent 
to permit private securities fraud actions for recovery where, but only where, plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional 
elements of causation and loss""). "
691,4," In another case pending before this Court the parties selected New Mexico. See Thai Holding of Charlotte, Inc. v. Archer 
Daniels Midland Co., No. 03 CVS 15096 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2003). The use of nationwide class action settlements 
presided over by state judges can be troublesome. See infra P 60. "
698,1," ""The European Commission's 'Leniency Program' allows 'cartel participants [to] confess their wrongdoing' in return for 
prosecutorial leniency."" Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 266 n.18, 124 S. Ct. 2466, 159 L. Ed. 2d 355 
(2004)."
698,2," The Commission feels so strongly about this issue that it has filed briefs amicus curiae in two other cases in which similar 
issues have arisen. In In re Methionine Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 00-1311 CRB, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27122 (N.D. Cal. July 17, 
2002), Judge Breyer affirmed a special master's report which denied plaintiff's motion to compel. The special master, a retired 
former judge of this court, had conducted a comity analysis and concluded that ""the balance tips strongly in favor of"" respecting 
the Commission's interests, largely because, as here, the documents at issue were not seen as that important and alternative 
sources for the information existed. Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel at 13. In In re Vitamin Antitrust Litig., 2002 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 26490 (D.D.C. Jan. 23, 2002) and 25815 (Dec. 18, 2002), the court adopted a special master's report which 
recommended that the documents be produced after the master conducted a comity analysis. While the master's report was 
sealed, in balancing the comity factors the court concluded that the information there sought did not all originate outside the U.S. 
and could not be obtained from other sources. The court also doubted that production of the documents would undermine "
699,," important interests of the Commission based in part on expert testimony not offered in this case. 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26490 at 
*127-28."
699,3," See Empagaran S.A. v. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., 453 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2006). See also Methionine, MDL No. 00-1311 
CRB, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27122 (N.D. Cal. July 17, 2002), and Vitamins, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25815 at *33 (""the concerns 
of the EC should be addressed out of respect for the EC as a foreign Sovereign""). "
700,4," In an abundance of caution, I reviewed the EC documents in camera. My review confirmed their lack of importance to this 
litigation. Specifically, I found no reference to Kumho or to any conduct aimed at excluding anyone from the U.S. market."
700,5, Disavowal by Flexsys N.V. in this litigation of the admissions it made in Europe might alter the analysis of this factor. 
706,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3. 
709,1," Appellants also argue that the ""sham exception,"" which the Supreme Court has recognized in certain antitrust cases, precludes 
immunity. However, the Court has not recognized this exception in the context of state or municipal immunity, known as ""Parker"" 
immunity; it has only recognized the exception in the context of ""Noerr-Pennington"" immunity, which applies to private parties 
and is based on distinct, First Amendment considerations. See City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380. "
716,1," Although the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff class action complaint was filed by Stephen L. LaFrance Holdings (""LaFrance"") and SAJ 
Distributors (""SAJ"") as well, LaFrance and SAJ recently submitted a notice of voluntary dismissal. (Docket No. 60.) "
717,2," The Court notes that Direct Purchaser Plaintiff's complaint may suffer from another defect. Direct Purchaser Plaintiff does not 
dispute that neither Alza nor Johnson & Johnson sold Ditropan XL during the class period. Rather, its antitrust claim against 
these defendants is premised on the sales by Ortho-McNeil. In response to the Court's concern regarding the validity of a direct 
purchaser action that fails to name the direct seller, Direct Purchaser Plaintiff cited to Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 
97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), Royal Printing Co. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 621 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding 
that ""Illinois Brick does not bar an indirect purchaser's suit where the direct purchaser is a division or subsidiary of a co-
conspirator""), and In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Ligit., 497 F. Supp. 218, 227 (C.D. Cal. 
1990) (concluding ""that an indirect purchaser that purchases from an entity owned or controlled by the wrongdoer may sue to 
recover passed-on overcharges and is excepted from the general rule of Illinois Brick. …[T]he plaintiffs will be allowed to seek 
recovery only as to direct purchases from a defendant, a co-conspirator, sellers with whom the plaintiffs had pre-existing, fixed-
quantity, cost-plus contracts, or an entity controlled by a conspirator."") If Direct Purchaser Plaintiff intends to pursue this action, it 
should be careful to plead facts that demonstrate a basis to maintain a direct purchaser action against both Johnson & Johnson 
and Alza based on sales by Ortho-McNeil. "
718,3," Even though Alza did not move to dismiss Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' UCL claim on the grounds of lack of standing, the Court 
questioned Alza at the hearing on its motion as to whether its standing argument would apply to this claim as well. In response, 
Alza argued it would. However, HN1[
] non-California resident plaintiffs may bring a UCL claim based on misconduct that 
occurs within the California. Northwest Mortgage, Inc. v. Superior Court, 72 Cal. App. 4th 214, 222, 224-25, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 18 
(1999) (citing Diamond Multimedia Syst., Inc. v. Superior Court, 19 Cal. 4th 1036, 1063-64, 80 Cal. Rptr. 2d 828, 968 P.2d 539 
(1999)). Because Alza's principal place of business is in California, it is reasonable to infer the alleged misconduct occurred 
within California. At this procedural stage, the Court will not dismiss Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' UCL claim for lack of standing. 
However, this ruling is without prejudice to Alza raising this argument again if it appears that Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs do not 
have any evidence that demonstrates that the alleged misconduct actually occurred in California. "
719,4, The Court grants Alza's request for leave to submit this decision. 
720,5," Both parties assert that Colgan, 135 Cal. App. 4th 663, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 36 supports their position. However, the Court finds it 
does not assist either. In Colgan, the court struck down a restitution award to indirect purchaser plaintiffs who brought an 
antitrust action. Id. at 700. The court noted that the Korea Supply ""made clear that the 'object of restitution is to restore the status 
quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.'"" Colgan, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 697 (citing 
Korea Supply, 29 Cal. 4th at 1149). Restitution HN6[
] under § 17200 ""must be of a measurable amount to restore to the plaintiff what has been acquired by violations of the statutes, and that measurable amount must be supported by evidence."" Id at 
698. The court struck down the restitution award, not because the court was not authorized to award restitution to the customers, 
but because there was ""no evidence concerning the amount of restitution necessary to restore purchasers to the status quo 
ante."" Id. at 700 (emphasis in original). Because there was insufficient evidence to support the award, the court did not address 
the issue of whether restitution could be awarded to indirect purchasers."
720,6," The Court notes that Defendants contend Ortho-McNeil, not Alza, sold Ditropan XL during the class period. If true, Plaintiffs 
may be precluded from seeking any restitution because the money they are seeking to recover was not actually paid to Alza. 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs may need to proffer the existence of facts and authority demonstrating that the money paid to Ortho-
McNeil may be attributed to Alza for purposes of the UCL claim and that Ortho-McNeil should not be considered a separate 
entity. However, because Alza did not raise this point in its motion, and because the facts upon which the Court could decide this 
issue are not yet before it, the Court declines to dismiss Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' UCL claim at this stage. "
722,7," The Court notes that Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs allege a claim under California's antitrust law, the Cartwright Act, under both 
their second and third causes of action. Although Alza only raised its standing argument with respect to Plaintiffs' Cartwright Act 
claim under the third cause of action, the Court's finding that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate standing as to this claim necessarily 
applies to the same claim pled under the second cause of action. Accordingly, the Court need not address the parties' 
arguments as to whether Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged coercive conduct actionable under the Cartwright Act. "
760,1," For the purposes of this opinion, the court will assume a familiarity with the facts underlying this case. See Lansdale, 426 F. 
Supp. 2d at 269-74 (laying out the factual background behind the case). "
762,2," Plaintiffs incorrectly claim that the court required them to calculate actual damages to avoid summary judgment. In the April 5 
decision, this court reviewed plaintiffs' damage request as evidence as to whether their price squeeze claim was an example of "
763,," non-rate anticompetitive behavior and thus the filed rate doctrine applied. Lansdale, 426 F. Supp. 2d at 288 n.18. Review of 
plaintiffs' alleged damages only reinforced the court's view that plaintiffs' price squeeze claim was rate-related. Id. "
764,3," Plaintiffs also argue that the Second Circuit's decision in City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 
1981) supports their claim that the filed rate doctrine does not bar a price squeeze claim based on the interaction of FERC and 
state approved rates. However, there is no indication that the retail rates at issue in Groton were ever approved by a state 
energy commission. Id. Additionally, the Second Circuit did not base its decision on the absence of FERC's ability to relieve the 
price squeeze. Rather, the court found that the filed rate doctrine did not bar plaintiff's price squeeze claims because the filed 
rates were later disapproved by FERC, thus the rates at issue were not ""filed and approved,"" as required by the doctrine. Id. at 
931. The court also found the competitor exception to the filed rate doctrine applied because the litigants were competitors under 
the definition adopted by the Second Circuit. Id. at 929. As noted in the April 5, 2006 memorandum, under Third Circuit 
precedent, the competitor exception does not apply in the instant case. Lansdale, 426 F. Supp. 2d at 286 n.15 (citing 
Utilimax.com, 378 F.3d at 308). "
765,4," The court did find that injunctive relief could be granted in this case without interfering with the state and federal regulatory 
scheme because plaintiffs did not ""seek injunctive relief against [the defendant]'s charging the filed rate, but rather against 
multifaceted anticompetitive activities of [the defendant] which are unrelated to its conduct at the time of sale."" Newark, 467 F. 
Supp. at 768. However, as discussed in the April 5, 2006 opinion, the Boroughs' basis for injunctive relief is now moot and their 
only available relief is in the form of money damages. Lansdale, 426 F. Supp. 2d at 285 n.14. "
766,5," PPL argues that since FERC may consider an alleged price squeeze in the setting of wholesale rates, and the PUC is sensitive 
to maintaining competitive retail rates, the interaction between the two rates is monitored by the agencies. (Def. Opp'n 
Reconsideration Apr. 5 Order 3-4.) PPL bases part of its argument upon FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 96 S. Ct. 1999, 48 
L. Ed. 2d 626 (1976). In Conway, the Supreme Court held that the FPC had a duty to consider price squeeze allegations when 
deciding whether a proposed wholesale rate was just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. Id. at 279. Though the FPC could not 
order an increase in the state-supervised retail rate when a price squeeze was found to exist, the FPC could afford relief by 
fixing the wholesale rate in ""the lower range of the zone of reasonableness"" and directing a refund of the charges previously 
collected subject to refund. Id. On March 21, 1977, FERC issued regulations to comply with the Conway decision. See 18 C.F.R. 
§ 2.17 (dealing with the anti-competitive effects of price squeezes). Conway does not bar a district court's review of a plaintiff's price squeeze claim. ""[T]he mere fact that FERC may consider 
arguments based on antitrust concepts does not preclude later antitrust review,"" because ""[t]here is no certainty that use of the 
limited powers of [] FERC can fully remedy an antitrust violation."" Ellwood City, 462 F. Supp. at 1349-1350. ""[T]he only remedy [] 
FERC can grant is to reduce the wholesale price . . . which, depending on where the retail price is set, may or may not be 
enough to eliminate a price squeeze."" Kirkwood, 671 F.2d at 1178. FERC does not provide a mechanism equivalent to the 
antitrust laws ""to safeguard a strong public interest in free and open competition."" Ellwood City, 462 F. Supp. at 1349 (citing 
Gordon v. N. Y. Stock Exch., Inc., 422 U.S. 659, 692, 95 S. Ct. 2598, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463 (1975)). District court review is necessary 
to preserve the more extensive remedies a court can provide, including equitable relief and awarding damages. Id. at 1350. With regard to state regulation of the rate interaction, though the PUC considers questions that arise regarding the effect of retail 
rates on competition, this does not prevent this court from also reviewing such claims. Therefore, this court cannot conclude that 
the PUC and FERC's ability to review the interaction between the retail and wholesale rates was an intended substitute for the 
antitrust laws in a situation involving the alleged monopolizing effect of a dual price structure."
766,6," The facts in this case counsel against application of the filed rate doctrine. FERC approved the wholesale rate structure in the 
Settlement Agreement (which resulted in the five-year Power Supply Agreements) on May 29, 1998. Lansdale, 426 F. Supp. 2d 
at 273. The Joint Petition, which specified PPL's POLR retail rates, was approved by the PUC on August 27, 1998. Id. Thus, 
because the Settlement Agreement was approved before PPL's POLR retail rates were approved, FERC could not have 
considered the potential of a price squeeze with the rates that later became effective. Also, because the Settlement Agreement 
and Power Supply Agreements provided for wholesale rate changes from February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2004 and the Joint 
Petition provided a variable fixed retail rate range as of 2002, it would be impossible for the agencies to predict the movement of 
the energy markets and the possibility of a price squeeze situation arising. "
767,7," Though the court finds that plaintiffs' price squeeze claim is not barred by the filed rate doctrine, plaintiffs' second Sherman Act 
§ 2 claim, that PPL monopolized the ICAP market, is still barred by the doctrine. The filed rate doctrine bars antitrust claims 
""based on rates that have been filed and approved by federal agencies,"" thus the monopolization of the ICAP market itself may 
not be the basis for a Sherman Act § 2 claim because FERC had power to oversee the rates. See Utilimax.com, 378 F.3d at 
306. The problems that arise where a plaintiff asserts a price squeeze based on the interaction of a federally-approved 
wholesale rate and state-approved retail rate are not an issue where a single administrative agency is charged with oversight. "
770,1," At oral argument, Silicon Image stipulated that the UCL Claim is preempted to the extent it is based on alleged violations of the 
Copyright Act and theft of trade secrets. "
774,2," Analogix stipulated at oral argument that it does not challenge the ""unfair"" business practices 28 alleged by Silicon Image on 
the basis of preemption. "
787,1," The 1984 divestiture of AT&T's local telephone service created seven Regional Bell Operating Companies.  Through a series of 
mergers and acquisitions, those seven companies were consolidated into the four ILECs named in this suit:  BellSouth 
Corporation, Qwest Communications International, Inc., SBC Communications, Inc., and Verizon Communications, Inc. 
(successor-in-interest to Bell Atlantic Corporation).  Complaint P 21, App. 16.  Together, these ILECs allegedly control 90 
percent or more of the market for local telephone service in the 48 contiguous States.  Id., P 48, App. 26. "
788,2," In setting forth the grounds for § 1 relief, the complaint repeats these allegations in substantially similar language: ""Beginning at least as early as February 6, 1996, and continuing to the present, the exact dates being unknown to Plaintiffs, 
Defendants and their co-conspirators engaged in a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their 
respective local telephone and/or high speed internet services markets by, among other things, agreeing not to compete 
with one another and to stifle attempts by others to compete with them and otherwise allocating customers and markets to 
one another in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.""  Id., P 64, App. 30-31. "
789,3," The dissent greatly oversimplifies matters by suggesting that the Federal Rules somehow dispensed with the pleading of facts 
altogether.  See post, at 580, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (pleading standard of Federal Rules ""does not 
require, or even invite, the pleading of facts"").  While, for most types of cases, the Federal Rules eliminated the cumbersome 
requirement that a claimant ""set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim,"" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. 
Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957) (emphasis added), Rule 8(a)(2) still requires a ""showing,"" rather than a blanket assertion, of 
entitlement to relief.  Without some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the 
requirement of providing not only ""fair notice"" of the nature of the claim, but also ""grounds"" on which the claim rests.  See 5 
Wright & Miller § 1202, at 94, 95 (Rule 8(a) ""contemplate[s] the statement of circumstances, occurrences, and events in support 
of the claim presented"" and does not authorize a pleader's ""bare averment that he wants relief and is entitled to it""). "
790,4," Commentators have offered several examples of parallel conduct allegations that would state a § 1 claim under this standard.  
See, e.g., 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp P 1425, at 167-185 (discussing ""parallel behavior that would probably not result from chance, 
coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among 
the parties""); Blechman, Conscious Parallelism, Signalling and Facilitating Devices: The Problem of Tacit Collusion Under the 
Antitrust Laws, 24 N. Y. L. S. L. Rev. 881, 899 (1979) (describing ""conduct [that] indicates the sort of restricted freedom of action 
and sense of obligation that one generally associates with agreement"").  The parties in this case agree that ""complex and 
historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors, and made for no 
other discernible reason,"" would support a plausible inference of conspiracy.  Brief for Respondents 37; see also Reply Brief for 
Petitioners 12."
790,5," The border in DM Research was the line between the conclusory and the factual.  Here it lies between the factually neutral and 
the factually suggestive.  Each must be crossed to enter the realm of plausible liability. "
791,6," The dissent takes heart in the reassurances of plaintiffs' counsel that discovery would be ""'""phased""'"" and ""limited to the 
existence of the alleged conspiracy and class certification.""  Post, at 593, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 963.  But determining whether some 
illegal agreement may have taken place between unspecified persons at different ILECs (each a multibillion dollar corporation 
with legions of management level employees) at some point over seven years is a sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming 
undertaking not easily susceptible to the kind of line-drawing and case management that the dissent envisions.  Perhaps the 
best answer to the dissent's optimism that antitrust discovery is open to effective judicial control is a more extensive quotation of 
the authority just cited, a judge with a background in antitrust law.  Given the system that we have, the hope of effective judicial 
supervision is slim:  ""The timing is all wrong.  The plaintiff files a sketchy complaint (the Rules of Civil Procedure discourage 
fulsome documents), and discovery is launched.  A judicial officer does not know the details of the case the parties will present 
and in theory cannot know the details.  Discovery is used to find the details.  The judicial officer always knows less than the 
parties, and the parties themselves may not know very well where they are going or what they expect to find.  A magistrate 
supervising discovery does not--cannot--know the expected productivity of a given request, because the nature of the 
requester's claim and the contents of the files (or head) of the adverse party are unknown.  Judicial officers cannot measure the 
costs and benefits to the requester and so cannot isolate impositional requests.  Requesters have no reason to disclose their 
own estimates because they gain from imposing costs on rivals (and may lose from an improvement in accuracy).  The portions 
of the Rules of Civil Procedure calling on judges to trim back excessive demands, therefore, have been, and are doomed to be, "
792,," hollow.  We cannot prevent what we cannot detect; we cannot detect what we cannot define; we cannot define 'abusive' 
discovery except in theory, because in practice we lack essential information.""  Easterbrook, Discovery as Abuse, 69 B. U. L. 
Rev. 635, 638-639 (1989) (footnote omitted)."
792,7," The Court of Appeals also relied on Chief Judge Clark's suggestion in Nagler v. Admiral Corp., 248 F.2d 319 (CA2 1957), that 
facts indicating parallel conduct alone suffice to state a claim under § 1. 425 F.3d at 114 (citing Nagler, supra, at 325).  But 
Nagler gave no explanation for citing Theatre Enterprises (which upheld a denial of a directed verdict for plaintiff on the ground 
that proof of parallelism was not proof of conspiracy) as authority that pleading parallel conduct sufficed to plead a Sherman Act 
conspiracy.  Now that Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), and 
Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), have made it 
clear that neither parallel conduct nor conscious parallelism, taken alone, raise the necessary implication of conspiracy, it is time 
for a fresh look at adequacy of pleading when a claim rests on parallel action. "
793,8," Because Conley's ""'no set of facts'"" language was one of our earliest statements about pleading under the Federal Rules, it is 
no surprise that it has since been ""cited as authority"" by this Court and others.  Post, at 577, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 953.  Although we 
have not previously explained the circumstances and rejected the literal reading of the passage embraced by the Court of 
Appeals, our analysis comports with this Court's statements in the years since Conley.  See Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v 
Broudo, 544 U.S., at 336, 347, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005) (requiring ""'reasonably founded hope that the 
[discovery] process will reveal relevant evidence'"" to support the claim (alteration in Dura) (quoting Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor 
Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 741, 95 S. Ct. 1917, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1975); alteration in Dura)); Associated Gen. Contractors of 
Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (""It is not . . . proper to assume that [the 
plaintiff] can prove facts that it has not alleged or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been 
alleged""); Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U.S. 381, 383, 81 S. Ct. 632, 5 L. Ed. 2d 620 (1961) (""In the absence of . . . an allegation 
[that the arrest was made without probable cause] the courts below could not, nor can we, assume that respondents arrested 
petitioner without probable cause to believe that he had committed . . . a narcotics offense"").  Nor are we reaching out to decide 
this issue in a case where the matter was not raised by the parties, see post, at 579, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955, since both the ILECs 
and the Government highlight the problems stemming from a literal interpretation of Conley's ""no set of facts"" language and seek 
clarification of the standard.  Brief for Petitioners 27-28; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22-25; see also Brief for 
Respondents 17 (describing ""[p]etitioners and their amici"" as mounting an ""attack on Conley's 'no set of facts' standard"") The dissent finds relevance in Court of Appeals precedents from the 1940s, which allegedly gave rise to Conley's ""no set of 
facts"" language. See post, at 580-583, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 955-957.  Even indulging this line of analysis, these cases do not 
challenge the understanding that, before proceeding to discovery, a complaint must allege facts suggestive of illegal conduct.  
See, e.g., Leimer v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Worcester, Mass., 108 F.2d 302, 305 (CA8 1940) (""'[I]f, in view of what is 
alleged, it can reasonably be conceived that the plaintiffs . . . could, upon a trial, establish a case which would entitle them to . . . 
relief, the motion to dismiss should not have been granted'""); Continental Collieries, Inc. v. Shober, 130 F.2d 631, 635 (CA3 
1942) (""No matter how likely it may seem that the pleader will be unable to prove his case, he is entitled, upon averring a claim, 
to an opportunity to try to prove it"").  Rather, these cases stand for the unobjectionable proposition that, HN11[
] LEdHN[11][ ] [11] when a complaint adequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed based on a district court's assessment that the 
plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.  Cf. Scheuer v. 
Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974) (a district court weighing a motion to dismiss asks ""not 
whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims"")."
793,9," See Complaint PP 51, 64, App. 27, 30-31 (alleging that ILECs engaged in a ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" and agreed 
not to compete with one another). "
794,10," If the complaint had not explained that the claim of agreement rested on the parallel conduct described, we doubt that the 
complaint's references to an agreement among the ILECs would have given the notice required by Rule 8.  Apart from identifying 
a 7-year span in which the § 1 violations were supposed to have occurred (i.e., ""[b]eginning at least as early as February 6, 
1996, and continuing to the present,"" id., P 64, App. 30), the pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or person involved in 
the alleged conspiracies.  This lack of notice contrasts sharply with the model form for pleading negligence, Form 9, which the 
dissent says exemplifies the kind of ""bare allegation"" that survives a motion to dismiss.  Post, at 576, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 953.  
Whereas the model form alleges that the defendant struck the plaintiff with his car while plaintiff was crossing a particular 
highway at a specified date and time, the complaint here furnishes no clue as to which of the four ILECs (much less which of 
their employees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit agreement took place.  A defendant wishing to prepare an 
answer in the simple fact pattern laid out in Form 9 would know what to answer; a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs' 
conclusory allegations in the § 1 context would have little idea where to begin."
794,11," The dissent's quotations from the complaint leave the impression that plaintiffs directly allege illegal agreement; in fact, they 
proceed exclusively via allegations of parallel conduct, as both the District Court and Court of Appeals recognized.  See 313 F. 
Supp. 2d 174, 182 (SDNY 2003); 425 F.3d 99, 102-104 (CA2 2005)."
794,12," From the allegation that the ILECs belong to various trade associations, see Complaint P 46, App. 23, the dissent playfully 
suggests that they conspired to restrain trade, an inference said to be ""buttressed by the common sense of Adam Smith.""  Post, 
at 591, 594, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 962, 963-964.  If Adam Smith is peering down today, he may be surprised to learn that his tongue-
in-cheek remark would be authority to force his famous pinmaker to devote financial and human capital to hire lawyers, prepare 
for depositions, and otherwise fend off allegations of conspiracy; all this just because he belonged to the same trade guild as 
one of his competitors when their pins carried the same price tag. "
795,13," The complaint quoted a reported statement of Qwest's CEO, Richard Notebaert, to suggest that the ILECs declined to 
compete against each other despite recognizing that it ""'might be a good way to turn a quick dollar.'""  P 42, App. 22 (quoting 
Chicago Tribune, Oct. 31, 2002, Business Section, p 1).  This was only part of what he reportedly said, however, and the District 
Court was entitled to take notice of the full contents of the published articles referenced in the complaint, from which the 
truncated quotations were drawn.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 201. Notebaert was also quoted as saying that entering new markets as 
a CLEC would not be ""a sustainable economic model"" because the CLEC pricing model is ""just . . . nuts.""  Chicago Tribune, Oct. 
31, 2002, Business Section, p 1 (cited at Complaint P 42, App. 22).  Another source cited in the complaint quotes Notebaert as 
saying he thought it ""unwise"" to ""base a business plan"" on the privileges accorded to CLECs under the 1996 Act because the 
regulatory environment was too unstable.  Chicago Tribune, Dec. 19, 2002, Business Section, p 2 (cited at Complaint P 45, App. 
23)."
795,14," In reaching this conclusion, we do not apply any ""heightened"" pleading standard, nor do we seek to broaden the scope of 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9, which can only be accomplished ""'by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by 
judicial interpretation.'""  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 515, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002) (quoting 
Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
517 (1993)).  On certain subjects understood to raise a high risk of abusive litigation, a plaintiff must state factual allegations with 
greater particularity than Rule 8 requires.  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 9(b)-(c).  Here, our concern is not that the allegations in the 
complaint were insufficiently ""particular[ized],"" ibid.; rather, the complaint warranted dismissal because it failed in toto to render 
plaintiffs' entitlement to relief plausible. "

800,6," The majority is correct to say that what the Federal Rules require is a ""'showing'"" of entitlement to relief.  Ante, at 555, n 3, 167 
L. Ed. 2d, at 940.  Whether and to what extent that ""showing"" requires allegations of fact will depend on the particulars of the 
claim.  For example, had the amended complaint in this case alleged only parallel conduct, it would not have made the required 
""showing.""  See supra, at 570-571, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 949.  Similarly, had the pleadings contained only an allegation of 
agreement, without specifying the nature or object of that agreement, they would have been susceptible to the charge that they "
801,," did not provide sufficient notice that the defendants may answer intelligently.  Omissions of that sort instance the type of 
""bareness"" with which the Federal Rules are concerned.  A plaintiff's inability to persuade a district court that the allegations 
actually included in her complaint are ""plausible"" is an altogether different kind of failing, and one that should not be fatal at the 
pleading stage. "
803,7," See also 5 Wright & Miller § 1202, at 89-90 (""[P]leadings under the rules simply may be a general summary of the party's 
position that is sufficient to advise the other party of the event being sued upon, to provide some guidance in a subsequent 
proceeding as to what was decided for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel, and to indicate whether the case should 
be tried to the court or to a jury.  No more is demanded of the pleadings than this; indeed, history shows that no more can be 
performed successfully by the pleadings"" (footnotes omitted)). "
804,8," Our decision in Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005), is not to the contrary.  
There, the plaintiffs failed adequately to allege loss causation, a required element in a private securities fraud action.  Because it 
alleged nothing more than that the prices of the securities the plaintiffs purchased were artificially inflated, the Dura complaint 
failed to ""provid[e] the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic loss might be or of what the causal connection 
might be between that loss and the [alleged] misrepresentation.""  Id., at 347, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577.  Here, the 
failure the majority identifies is not a failure of notice--which ""notice pleading"" rightly condemns--but rather a failure to satisfy the 
Court that the agreement alleged might plausibly have occurred.  That being a question not of notice but of proof, it should not 
be answered without first hearing from the defendants (as apart from their lawyers). Similarly, in Associated Gen. Contractors of 
Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), in which we also found an antitrust complaint 
wanting, the problem was not that the injuries the plaintiffs alleged failed to satisfy some threshold of plausibility, but rather that 
the injuries as alleged were not ""the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.""  Id., at 540, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. 
Ed. 2d 723; see id., at 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (""As the case comes to us, we must assume that the Union can 
prove the facts alleged in its amended complaint.  It is not, however, proper to assume that the Union can prove facts that it has 
not alleged or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been alleged""). "
805,9," The Court suggests that the allegation of an agreement, even if credited, might not give the notice required by Rule 8 because 
it lacks specificity.  Ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946.  The remedy for an allegation lacking sufficient specificity to provide 
adequate notice is, of course, a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement.  See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 
506, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002).  Petitioners made no such motion and indeed have conceded that ""[o]ur 
problem with the current complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite specific.""  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Thus, the fact that ""the 
pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or persons involved in the alleged conspiracies,"" ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d, 
at 946, is, for our purposes, academic."
805,10," The Court describes my reference to the allegation that the defendants belong to various trade associations as ""playfully"" 
suggesting that the defendants conspired to restrain trade.  Ante, at 567, n 12, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 947.  Quite the contrary:  An 
allegation that competitors meet on a regular basis, like the allegations of parallel conduct, is consistent with--though not 
sufficient to prove--the plaintiffs' entirely serious and unequivocal allegation that the defendants entered into an unlawful 
agreement.  Indeed, if it were true that the plaintiffs ""rest their § 1 claim on descriptions of parallel conduct and not on any 
independent allegation of actual agreement among the ILECs,"" ante, at 564, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946, there would have been no 
purpose in including a reference to the trade association meetings in the amended complaint. "
806,11," It is ironic that the Court seeks to justify its decision to draw factual inferences in the defendants' favor at the pleading stage by 
citing to a rule of evidence, ante, at 568, n 13, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 948.  Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), a judicially noticed 
fact ""must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned.""  Whether Notebaert's statements constitute evidence of a conspiracy is hardly beyond reasonable dispute."
806,12," The Court worries that a defendant seeking to respond to this ""conclusory"" allegation ""would have little idea where to begin.""  
Ante, at 565, n 10, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 946.  A defendant could, of course, begin by either denying or admitting the charge."
806,13," The potential for ""sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming"" discovery, ante, at 560, n 6, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 943, is no 
reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The Court vastly underestimates a district court's case-management arsenal.  
Before discovery even begins, the court may grant a defendant's Rule 12(e) motion; Rule 7(a) permits a trial court to order a 
plaintiff to reply to a defendant's answer, see Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 
(1998); and Rule 23 requires ""rigorous analysis"" to ensure that class certification is appropriate, General Telephone Co. of 
Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982); see In re Initial Public Offering Securities 
Litigation, 471 F.3d 24 (CA2 2006) (holding that a district court may not certify a class without ruling that each Rule 23 
requirement is met, even if a requirement overlaps with a merits issue).  Rule 16 invests a trial judge with the power, backed by 
sanctions, to regulate pretrial proceedings via conferences and scheduling orders, at which the parties may discuss, inter alia, 
""the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses,"" Rule 16(c)(1); ""the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings,"" 
Rule 16(c)(2); ""the control and scheduling of discovery,"" Rule 16(c)(6); and ""the need for adopting special procedures for 
managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or 
unusual proof problems,"" Rule 16(c)(12).  Subsequently, Rule 26 confers broad discretion to control the combination of 
interrogatories, requests for admissions, production requests, and depositions permitted in a given case; the sequence in which 
such discovery devices may be deployed; and the limitations imposed upon them.  See 523 U.S., at 598-599, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 
140 L. Ed. 2d 759.  Indeed, Rule 26(c) specifically permits a court to take actions ""to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense"" by, for example, disallowing a particular discovery request, setting 
appropriate terms and conditions, or limiting its scope. In short, the Federal Rules contemplate that pretrial matters will be settled 
through a flexible process of give and take, of proffers, stipulations, and stonewalls, not by having trial judges screen allegations "
807,," for their plausibility vel non without requiring an answer from the defendant.  See Societe Internationale pour Participations 
Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 206, 78 S. Ct. 1087, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (1958) (""Rule 34 is 
sufficiently flexible to be adapted to the exigencies of particular litigation"").  And should it become apparent over the course of 
litigation that a plaintiff's filings bespeak an in terrorem suit, the district court has at its call its own in terrorem device, in the form 
of a wide array of Rule 11 sanctions.  See Rules 11(b), (c) (authorizing sanctions if a suit is presented ""for any improper 
purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation""); see Business Guides, 
Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 111 S. Ct. 922, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1991) (holding that Rule 
11 applies to a represented party who signs a pleading, motion, or other papers, as well as to attorneys); Atkins v. Fischer, 232 
F.R.D. 116, 126 (DC 2005) (""As possible sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, the court has an arsenal of options at its disposal"")."
807,14," Given his ""background in antitrust law,"" ante, at 560, n 6, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 943, Judge Easterbrook has recognized that the 
most effective solution to discovery abuse lies in the legislative and rulemaking arenas.  He has suggested that the remedy for 
the ills he complains of requires a revolution in the rules of civil procedure: ""Perhaps a system in which judges pare away issues and focus on investigation is too radical to contemplate in this 
country--although it prevailed here before 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted.  The change 
could not be accomplished without abandoning notice pleading, increasing the number of judicial officers, and giving them 
more authority . . . .  If we are to rule out judge-directed discovery, however, we must be prepared to pay the piper.  Part of 
the price is the high cost of unnecessary discovery--impositional and otherwise.""  Discovery as Abuse, 69 B. U. L. Rev. 635, 
645 (1989). "
808,15," It would be quite wrong, of course, to assume that dismissal of an antitrust case after discovery is costless to plaintiffs.  See 
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)(1) (""[C]osts other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the 
court otherwise directs""). "
814,1," The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were modified by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 
2003. Pub. L. No. 108-173, § 1101(a)(2)(A)(ii), 117 Stat. 2066 (amended 2003). Herein, all references to the Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments and its regulatory framework include the scope of the provisions as later modified. "
816,2," The patents listed in Merck's NDA, which are the patents-in-suit, are U.S. Patent Nos. 5,358,941; 5,681,590; 5,849,726; 
6,008,207; 6,090,410; 6,194,004; 5,994,329; 6,015,801; and 6,225,294. "
817,3," Apotex also contends that the collateral consequences doctrine permits the court to retain jurisdiction. The court has 
considered the parties' arguments and finds Apotex's position to be without merit. "
818,4," The court is also troubled by the practical realities of a scheme, which in effect, if left as is, enmeshes the district courts in 
unnecessary, and in this court's opinion, improper involvement in business competition. This cycle not only contributes to court 
congestion but it wastes the court's valuable time and limited resources by conducting the business it must for these cases, until 
it reaches the merits of such contested motions to dismiss. The time-triggered provisions of the statute unrealistically 
presuppose the time in which the district courts are to manage their cases. While the court endeavors to be efficient and 
expeditious in resolving the matters pending before it, time proscriptions such as those that Congress has assumed in the 
Hatch-Waxman provisions, and those upon which the litigants press the court, are idealistic at best and unfeasible in practice. 
The joint effort of the branches of government to balance the interests of consumers with those of innovator and generic drug 
companies should not be so tunnel-visioned as to facilitate litigants in their attempts to catapult ANDA litigation as a priority in 
the district courts."
818,5," The Federal Trade Commission issued studies in 2002 and 2003 that examined and commented on the conduct of drug 
companies in the generic drug approval process. Fed. Trade Comm'n, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC 
Study (2002), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/07/genericdrugstudy.pdf; Fed. Trade Comm'n, To Promote Innovation: The 
Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy, (2003), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf. "
820,6," See Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249 (D.D.C. 2006) (upholding FDA's decision finding that dismissal for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction did not qualify as a ""court decision"" sufficient to trigger the 180-day exclusivity period). "
821,7," The court is by no means discharging the requirements of Rule 11 in the context of Hatch Waxman litigation. In this case, 
however, there are no alleged facts from which the court can conclude that, in fact, Merck knew that Apotex's generic version of 
Fosamax did not infringe Merck's patents at the time it filed suit pursuant to its statutory right to do so upon Apotex's paragraph 
IV certification. Although the Rule 12(b)(6) standard requires the court to accept all well-pleaded allegations as true, and to view 
them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the court will not credit bald and conclusory allegations. See United States v. Vespe, 
868 F.2d 1328, 1340 (3d Cir. 1989) (stating conclusory statements need not be credited)."
821,8," ""It is widely understood that the 180-day exclusivity period offers the potential for collusive settlement arrangements between 
pioneers and generics. A pioneer could initiate a patent infringement suit against a first generic ANDA filer and settle the 
litigation with a 'non-entry' payment to the generic, under which the generic would delay commercialization of the generic 
product, thus postponing the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period and locking other generics out of the market 
indefinitely."" Herbert Hovenkamp et al., Anticompetitive Settlement of Intellectual Property Disputes, 87 Minn. L.Rev. 1719, 1755 
(2003). "
826,1," One Industries also moves for dismissal due to O'Neal's failure to allege all necessary elements of this claim. Because this 
Court ultimately finds the facts alleged by O'Neal does not support standing to sue on this claim, this Court will not address One 
Industries' remaining argument. "
828,2," Third party defendants state, in this footnote, that ""One Industries hereby withdraws its motion to dismiss Count III"" concerning 
trade dress infringement based on the clarification made by O'Neal in its opposition. Doc. # 20 at 1 n.1. This Court is mindful that 
One Industries and third party defendants are represented by the same counsel and filed their respective pleadings 
simultaneously containing identical footnotes. See id.; compare Doc. # 19 at 1 n.1. This Court is also mindful that third party 
defendants present no argument in reply concerning count three of the third party complaint which alleges trade dress 
infringement. This Court assumes the error in third party defendants' reply brief is merely typographical and, therefore, construes 
the statement as a withdrawal by third party defendants of their motion to dismiss count three of the third party complaint. "
829,3," The third party complaint is referenced herein as ""TPC."""
829,4," Because this Court dismisses third party defendant Blanchard, the remainder of the order relates only to third party defendant 
Boinnard even though the Court references both third party defendants as the moving parties. "
833,1," The caption to the counterclaim designates that Matthew Cheng is also a counterclaimant. The allegations in the counterclaim 
do not include Matthew Cheng, however, but only state that eCoupons is a counterclaimant. (See AC.) "
855,1," For purposes of pretrial proceedings, all parties in the indirect purchaser cases have agreed to litigate under one lead case - 
Petro Computer Sys., Inc. v. Micron Technology et al., No. C 05-2472 PJH."
855,2," The specific defendants at issue are as follows: Micron Technology, Inc.; Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc.; Infineon 
Technologies AG; Infineon Technologies North America Corporation; Mosel Vitelic Corporation; Mosel Vitelic Corporation USA; 
Nanya Technology Corporation; Nanya Technology Corporation USA; Elpida Memory, Inc.; Elpida Memory (USA), Inc.; Hynix 
Semiconductor, Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc.; Winbond Electronics Corporation; Winbond Electronics Corporation 
America, Inc.; and NEC Electronics America, Inc. (collectively ""defendants""). "
856,3," Plaintiffs have also filed two separate requests for judicial notice, and defendants have submitted at least one set of objections 
thereto. Plaintiffs specifically ask the court to grant judicial notice as to 23 different orders and pleadings that were entered in 
various cases throughout the country, as well as three different class action complaints filed in California state courts. Having 
considered the requests, and defendants' objections, the court hereby GRANTS plaintiffs' request for judicial notice, as it finds 
the subject matter proper for judicial notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201. "
858,4," Defendants' briefs are somewhat confusing on this point, since they include discussion of the Cartwright Act within the broader 
discussion of antitrust standing as to all fourteen states at issue."
858,5," The possibility that plaintiffs may be alleging claims based on purchases of both component DRAM and non-component DRAM 
is evidenced by the ambiguity of plaintiffs' allegations. See, e.g., Complaint, PP 9-17 (stating only that plaintiffs indirectly 
purchased DRAM ""for end use and not for resale,"" without distinguishing between purchases of DRAM, and purchases of DRAM 
as a product component). "
864,6," Plaintiffs' fourth claim for relief also re-states a claim under California's antitrust statute, the Cartwright Act, which defendants 
have targeted on this motion. See Complaint, P 97. Since standing under California's Cartwright Act has already been discussed 
in connection with plaintiffs' second claim for relief, however, the court omits discussion of that statute here."
864,7, Plaintiffs do not appear to have objected to defendants' submission of this material. 
865,8," Many of the cases included in the preceding string cite were included as part of plaintiffs' lodging of relevant opinions, which 
occurred after briefing on the instant motions was complete, but before the hearing. Similarly, after the hearing, defendants also 
filed an application for leave to lodge a recent opinion, which the court granted on April 18, 2007. To the extent that many of the 
cases - and others included in plaintiffs' accompanying requests for judicial notice - are unpublished and/or not included in any 
electronic database, the court has considered the cases only to the extent relevant on an issue directly before the court. "
870,9," Plaintiffs also argue, in conclusory fashion, that ""[w]here, as here, the timeliness of the claims depends on an examination of 
fact-intensive issues such as concealment, discovery and tolling, the issue cannot properly be resolved in a judgment on the 
pleadings."" See Pl. Opp. Br. at 2:18-3:1. Aside from this brief statement, however, plaintiffs make no showing as to why or how 
the issues of concealment, discovery, and/or tolling are fact-intensive as applied to this case, such that resolution of the statute 
of limitations issue - via 12(c) motion - is improper. Accordingly, plaintiffs' argument in this regard is unpersuasive. "
873,10," The court notes that there is a larger potential problem suggested by plaintiffs' complaint, which the parties have not 
addressed. Notwithstanding their arguments regarding the fact that plaintiffs are only seeking damages that are consistent with 
""federal and state antitrust laws,"" plaintiffs have not actually alleged that they are seeking any damages pursuant to any of the 
consumer protection statutes alleged in the complaint. See Complaint, Prayer for Relief at 28:27:19-28:27. Accordingly, and 
based on their failure to allege as such, there is an argument to be made that plaintiffs are unable to recover any damages 
pursuant to the consumer protection statutes alleged in their complaint, in the event those statutes provide for damages. Since 
the parties have not raised this argument, however, the court refrains from making a final determination as to this issue. "
876,11," Plaintiffs also point to Arkansas state law authority that purportedly expressly ruled that indirect purchasers may bring antitrust 
claims under the ADTPA. See Pl. Opp. Br. Re Fifth Claim for Relief at 11:6-8. However, that decision has not been attached, 
and the court was unable to procure it from the standard electronic publishing databases. Accordingly, the court takes note of 
the existence of this authority, but does not rely on it. "
884,12," Moreover, defendants are also correct, and plaintiffs do not dispute, that the WVCCP defines ""consumer"" to mean ""a natural 
person to whom a sale or lease is made … for a personal, family, household or agricultural purpose."" W. Va. Code § 46A-6-
102(2). And since the only provision pursuant to which plaintiffs may bring their claim is entitled, ""Actions by consumers,"" it is 
correct that the instant claim can only be brought by natural persons who purchased the goods in question for a personal, family, 
household or agricultural purpose. "
889,1," Hitwise describes itself as ""the leading online competitive intelligence service."" (Opp'n, Ex. A (""Hitwise Report""), p. 28). 
According to Hitwise, ""[t]hrough relationships with [Internet Service Providers] around the world, Hitwise's patented methodology 
captures the anonymous online usage, search, and conversion behavior of 25 million Internet users."" (Id.). In this order I cite this 
report frequently because it is specifically referred to in the FAC and MySpace attached it in support of its motion. "
890,2," See also, Futurevision Cable Systems of Wiggins, Inc. v. Multivision Cable TV Corp., in which the court dismissed an antitrust 
claim for failure to state a relevant market. 789 F.Supp. 760 (S.D. Miss. 1992). The court found that the only markets in which 
the defendant television stations, The Learning Channel and ESPN, possibly had market power were the markets for their own 
programs. Id. at 776. Thus, the plaintiff had not alleged a relevant market, because a manufacturer's natural monopoly over its 
own product is not a basis for antitrust liability under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Id."
890,3, AOL's suit sought damages and an injunction to prohibit the sending of such e-mail. Id. at 854. 
893,4," In the short interval since the hearing on this motion, other articles have appeared in the print media about the mounting 
increase in the popularity of social networking sites. E.g., Patrick Day, MySpace competition? The world is big enough, Los 
Angeles Times, April 1, 2007, at E15 (noting that in internet social websites created in foreign countries, which are not within the "
894,," market LiveUniverse alleges to be part of, MySpace is encountering formidable competition); Brad Stone & Matt Richtel, One 
Call to Tell the World All about You, N.Y. Times, April 30, 2007, at Cl (noting the growth of social networking via cell phones); 
Brad Stone, Facebook Goes off the Campus, N.Y. Times, May 25, 2007, at Cl (describing expansion of ""Facebook"" into 
MySpace's ""turf"")."
894,5," In Microsoft, the Court of Appeals observed that ""Once a product or standard achieves wide acceptance, it becomes more or 
less entrenched. Competition in such industries is 'for the field' rather than 'within the field.' . . . In technologically dynamic 
markets, however, such entrenchment may be temporary, because innovation may alter the field altogether. . . . Rapid 
technological change leads to markets in which firms compete through innovation for temporary market dominance, from which 
they may be displaced by the next wave of product advancements. . . . [T]here is no consensus among commentators on the 
question of whether, and to what extent, current monopolization doctrine should be amended to account for competition in 
technologically dynamic markets characterized by network effects."" 253 F.3d at 49-50 (internal citations omitted). "
895,6," It remains to be seen whether causing this alleged ""injury"" to consumers will in fact backfire against MySpace. With Internet 
users being only (at most) a few clicks away from other sites on the Web, if MySpace's users/members react with hostility to 
these measures, they may choose to use and visit rival sites. "
898,7," Because in the trial court the plaintiffs had not proffered evidence to rebut Microsoft's proffered justification for this conduct, the 
Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding of liability for this design change. 253 F.3d at 67."
898,8," This overstates what actually has occurred, evidently. As MySpace argues (without refutation), ""Users - including MySpace 
users - can email, blog and chat with their friends about 'LiveUniverse' and 'vidiLife' to their heart's content. The only thing that 
has been eliminated - and the only conduct at issue - is the presence of separate active links (i.e., website addresses like 
'www.vidiLife.com') on the MySpace.com website that take users directly from MySpace.com to vidiLife.com in a single mouse 
click."" "
902,9," In Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp., 93 Cal.App. 4th 363, 375, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 175 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001), the Court of Appeal held 
that ""conduct alleged to be 'unfair' because it unreasonably restrains competition and harms consumers . . . is not 'unfair' if the 
conduct is deemed reasonable and condoned under the antitrust laws."" Although the California Supreme Court has not 
articulated this principle, it appears to be sound and to be applicable here."
902,10, Dkt. No. 17. 
913,1," The only allegations against SSH concern its alleged  [**4] violation of restraint of trade by attempting with Champion to 
enforce certain noncompetition agreements against Cole. Although SSH has joined with Champion in the motion for summary 
judgment, I will refer primarily to Champion when addressing the parties' respective arguments."
913,2," More  [**6] specifically, during the time that he served as President, Retail Operations, Cole was a ""named executive officer"" in 
Champion's proxy materials, as one of the company's ""four most highly compensated executive officers other than the CEO."" 
This meant that his compensation and any employment contract or arrangement that he had with Champion was subject to 
disclosure under various SEC regulations. (See Collins Aff. P 6, docket no. 114.) "
918,3," Furthermore, HN11[
] under Michigan law, in determining whether the parties intended to require a written document in order 
for a contract to be binding, a court applies the following factors: (1) whether the contract is of that class which are usually found 
to be  [**25] in writing; (2) whether it is of such nature as to need a formal writing for its full expression; (3) whether it has few or 
many details; (4) whether the amount involved is large or small; (5) whether it is a common or unusual contract; and (6) whether 
the negotiations themselves indicate that a written draft is contemplated as a final conclusion of the negotiations. Dow Chem. 
Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40866, 2005 WL 1862418, at *33. "
919,4," In the Amended Complaint, Cole alleged that  [**29] Champion failed to pay Cole the following, all of which constitute wages 
under N.C. GEN. STAT. 95-25.2(16): Cole's increased salary retroactive to January 2004; Cole's additional increases upon 
Champion experiencing two consecutive profitable quarters; Cole's bonus compensation for 2004 through and including the date 
of termination; Cole's vested performance shares; Cole's right to hold, as vested and not immediately exercisable, his stock 
option grants per the terms of the January and February 2001 stock option agreements; and severance benefits pursuant to a 
March 2004 agreement with Champion. (Am. Compl. P 62.) "
920,5," As Champion notes, in the wake of Enron and other corporate governance scandals, HN18[
] in July 2002 Congress enacted 
the Sarbanes Oxley Act, and the New York Stock Exchange began to consider, and later adopted, rules for listed companies 
that, among other things, required stricter oversight by the Board of executive management, a compensation committee 
comprised entirely of independent directors, the adoption of a charter for the compensation committee that specifically set out 
the committee's authority regarding executive compensation, the required adoption of corporate governance guidelines, and the 
disclosure of those guidelines and committee charters on the listed company's website. (See Defs.' Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 
5-6, docket no. 121.) "
921,6," HN19[
] A ""change in control"" generally refers to a transfer of ownership in which a new person or entity obtains a fifty 
percent or greater ownership interest. Senior executive contracts often contain a change in control clause, which provides for 
certain protections in the event of a change of control in the company. "
922,7," In addition, as Champion notes, as to certain alleged wages, such as his alleged right to a bonus, Cole's Wage and Hour Act 
claim is fatally deficient because he is attempting to transform  [**39] alleged contractual damages into a claim for wages under 
the Act. HN20[
] The N.C. Wage and Hour Act protects employees from being denied payment of earned wages. See Hamilton, 118 N.C. App. at 8, 454 S.E.2d at 282. Thus, the Act only requires an employer to pay those wages and benefits due 
when the employee has actually performed the work required to earn them. Narron v. Hardee's Food Sys., Inc., 75 N.C. App. 
579, 583, 331 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1985). Since at the time of his October 18, 2004, termination, Cole had not performed the work 
required to earn the wages and bonuses he alleges, any possible remedy could only lie in breach of contract, not the Wage and 
Hour Act. The same is true for his claim under the Act related to his alleged right to ""performance shares"" and Champion's 
alleged promise to allow him to continue working for Champion in a limited capacity so that his equity interests could vest. "
923,8," These items included the following: (1) as an alternative to the immediate vesting of Cole's performance shares if he were 
removed as President, Retail Operations, Barrett asked if Champion would consider alternative corporate-based benchmarks to 
replace the retail benchmarks in Cole's performance shares award; (2) modifying the term of Cole's employment as Special 
Assistant through early 2007 so that more potential performance shares and other equity compensation could vest; (3) as an 
alternative to full benefits during his part-time employment as Special Assistant, whether Champion was willing to allow Cole to 
pay for those benefits under COBRA; (4) as an alternative to no stocking requirement, whether Champion would consider 
lowering the percentage from 80% to 50%; and (5) as an alternative to the immediate vesting of Cole's performance shares if he 
were removed as President, Retail Operations, whether Champion would confirm that Cole's employment as Special Assistant 
would  [**45] constitute employment under the terms of Champion's compensation plans and would not trigger a distribution. 
(Kreindler Aff. P 10, docket no. 115.) "
924,9," Champion contends additionally that, to the extent there was an oral contract, Michigan's statute of frauds bars Cole's contract 
claims because Cole has alleged that he was promised to be employed for a term of 3 years. HN22[
] Under Michigan law, 
contracts that, by their terms, cannot be completed within a year from their making are subject to Michigan's statute of frauds. 
MICH. COMP. LAWS § 566.132(1)(a) (applying specifically to ""[a]n agreement that, by its terms, is not to be performed within 1 
year from the making of the agreement""). Since there was no oral contract to begin with, there is no need to address the statute 
of frauds argument. "
925,10," Cole argues, alternatively, that Koch promised a severance plan that was independent of the Executive Officer Severance Pay 
Plan developed by Graskamp. Cole testified in his deposition, however, that Koch told him that he was going to be part of the 
plan being developed by Graskamp. (Cole Dep. 73.) Cole was clear that he was not being promised some ""separate"" severance 
agreement from other senior management. (Cole Dep. 72-73.) Thus, the only ""severance benefit plan"" that Koch discussed was 
the plan the Board adopted in December, after Cole's termination."
925,11," Indeed, as Champion notes, Cole himself stopped short of claiming that he and Koch had ""a deal"" regarding severance. Cole 
testified only that Koch told him he would be included in the plan under development. (Cole Dep. 72.) "
926,12, See N.C. GEN. STAT. § 75-16 (providing for treble damages). 
927,13," Moreover, the covenants not to compete specifically state that [i]f any one o[r] more of the terms contained [in the noncompetition agreement] shall for any reason be held  [**62] to be 
excessively broad with regard to time, duration, geographic scope, or activity, that term shall be construed in a matter to 
enable it to be enforced to the maximum extent compatible with applicable law. Thus, the terms of the noncompetition agreements specifically authorize the court to remove any unreasonable terms in the 
agreements so that the agreements could, nevertheless, be enforced with the reasonable terms intact. "
929,14," Indeed, as Champion has pointed out, allowing Cole to prove a restraint of trade claim based on single injury alone would not 
only trivialize the antitrust laws, elevating mere workplace grievances to the status of an antitrust action, but 
http://vikings.kfan.com/sports/nflguide/default.aspxit would also turn the ever-changing field of noncompete law into a high-
stakes gamble for employers, who could potentially face criminal sanctions under federal anti-trust laws for attempting to enforce 
a noncompete agreement that a court subsequently declares to be overbroad."
929,15," Champion argues, alternatively, that North Carolina's restraint of trade statute does not even apply because Michigan, not 
North Carolina, bears the ""most significant relationship"" to the covenants not to compete. The court need not delve into the 
choice of law issue because, even assuming that the Michigan statute applies, Champion is entitled to summary 
 [**70] judgment on the restraint of trade claim. "
942,1," By order dated March 30, 2006, the Circuit Court of Monongalia County amended its December 29, 2005, order to include 
language required by Rule 54(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure to permit Appellants to immediately appeal the 
December 29, 2005, order to this Court without waiting for their remaining claims to be adjudicated."
942,2," We also acknowledge and appreciate the contribution of amici curia the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the West 
Virginia Business and Industry Council to the legal arguments presented for our consideration herein. "
943,3," Although an actual copy of the 1975 contract does not appear in the record before this Court, various letters written by MAA 
counsel and representatives are contained within the record and confirm the existence of such a contract. For example, a June 
30, 1989, letter written by Michael J. Dempster, counsel for MAA during renegotiation of the contract states  [***10] ""the current 
agreement, that was signed on March 24, 1975, contemplates anesthesia services being provided exclusively by Mon 
Anesthesia Associates."" Additionally, a June 20, 1987, letter authored by Erdogan Ternan, M.D., MAA President, related to the 
""provision of anesthesia services for the open heart surgical procedures"" by an anesthesia team from West Virginia University 
Hospital and gave ""our consent to this approach as an exception to our otherwise exclusive right to provide anesthesia services 
at Monongalia General Hospital."" (Emphasis added). The June 20, 1987, letter also stated that the consent was ""limited to the 
provision of anesthesia services in connection with open heart surgery. In all other respects, the existing agreement between 
[MAA] and the Hospital [was to] continue[] in full force and effect."" Additionally, a Letter of Agreement was signed by Appellant 
Huber, as president of MAA, on June 23, 1992, documented a preliminary agreement between MAA and Monongalia General for 
the provision of anesthesia services through December 31, 1992, and an agreement to work ""in good faith to develop and 
execute, by December 31, 1992, a contract for exclusive anesthesia services,  [***11] excluding cardio-thoracic (open-heart) 
surgery services."" Further, Monongalia General agreed therein to ""not seek a permanent anesthesia services contract from any 
other group"" during that time period. "
944,4," In undertaking this analysis it is significant to remember that the exclusive contracts at issue herein where entered prior to this 
Court's determination that Monongalia General could not enter into exclusive contracts due to its status as a quasi-public 
hospital. "
947,5," Although Section 1 of the Sherman Act has been amended since the time that the WVATA was enacted, those amendments do 
not affect the substantive portion at issue herein, i.e., the first sentence, but, instead, impact the penalty provisions."
947,6," Appellants' argument that to construe the WVATA in harmony with federal  [***24] law creates a redundancy pursuant to which 
the WVATA is superfluous for the federal act is easily dismissed under fundamental principles of federalism. HN9[
] The 
federal act may only apply to contracts which impact interstate commerce, and, absent a finding that interstate commerce is 
affected, would not apply to contracts affecting solely state matters. While the federal government may enact legislation 
declaring certain contracts illegal if they tend to lessen competition and impact interstate commerce, a state is not precluded 
from legislating as to matters of public policy with reference to contracts in restraint of trade by virtue of its inherent police power. 
Mathews Conveyer, Co. v. Palmer-Bee, Co., 135 F.2d 73, 82 (6th Cir. 1943). "
948,7," HN15[
] Noting  [***30] the differing tests applicable to alleged per se activities and other violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court has explained: Certain agreements, such as horizontal price fixing and market allocation, are thought so inherently anticompetitive that 
each is illegal per se without inquiry into the harm it has actually caused. See generally Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). Other combinations, such as mergers, joint ventures, and 
various vertical agreements, hold the promise of increasing a firm's efficiency and enabling it to compete more effectively. 
Accordingly, such combinations are judged under a rule of reason, an inquiry into market power and market structure 
designed to assess the combination's actual effect. See, e.g., Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 
S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, (1977); Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683, 
(1918). Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 2740, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). "
949,8," This statute states, in pertinent part, "
950,," § 3. Every person shall be deemed to have committed a violation of this Act who shall: (1) Make any contract with, or engage in any combination or conspiracy with, any other  [***36] person who is, or but 
for a prior agreement would be, a competitor of such person: a. for the purpose or with the effect of fixing, controlling, or maintaining the price or rate charged for any commodity 
sold or bought by the parties thereto, or the fee charged or paid for any service performed or received by the parties 
thereto; b. fixing, controlling, maintaining, limiting, or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale or supply of any 
commodity, or the sale or supply of any service, for the purpose or with the effect stated in paragraph a. of subsection 
(1); c. allocating or dividing customers, territories, supplies, sales, or markets, functional or geographical, for any 
commodity or service[.]"
950,9," We note that the Minnesota antitrust statutes at issue in Alpine Air are substantively identical to W. Va. Code § 47-18-3 (a) and 
(b)(1). Minn.Stat. § 325D.51, at issue in Alpine Air provided ""a contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more 
persons in unreasonable restraint of trade is unlawful."" W. Va. Code § 47-18-3 (a), by contrast includes the term ""every"" before 
contract  [***38] and includes the phrase ""in this State shall"" in lieu of the term ""is"" in the Minnesota statute. Similarly, the 
statutory per se violations set forth in Minn. Stat. § 325D.53 at issue in Alpine Air were set forth in Subdivision 1 of that statute 
and state: Without limiting section 325D.51, the following shall be deemed to restrain trade or commerce unreasonably and are 
unlawful: (1) A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons in competition: (a) for the purpose or with the effect of affecting, fixing, controlling or maintaining the market price, rate, or fee of any 
commodity or service; "
951,," (b) affecting, fixing, controlling, maintaining, limiting, or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale or 
supply of any commodity, or the sale or supply of any service, for the purpose or with the effect of affecting, fixing, 
controlling, or maintaining the market price, rate, or fee of the commodity or service. The only differences between this statutory provision and W. Va. Code § 47-18-3(b) (1) (A)-(B), are the inclusion of the phrase 
""in competition"" in the introductory language and the inclusion of the term ""affecting"" in subdivisions (a) and (b)."
951,10," Article V, Section 1 of our Constitution provides, in relevant part: HN20[
] The legislative, executive and judicial departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither shall exercise 
the powers properly belonging to the either of the others; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of 
them at the same time[.] "
952,11," HN21[
] Such direction may come from Legislative enactments or our own precedent. For example, in State v. Andrews, 91 W. Va. 720, 114 S.E. 257 (1922), this Court held ""[t]he provisions of our constitution relating to unreasonable search and seizure 
and protecting one accused of a crime from being compelled to a be a witness against himself, being substantially the same as 
the corresponding provisions of the federal constitution and taken therefrom, should be given a construction  [***42] in harmony 
with the construction of federal provisions by the Supreme Court of the United States."" Syl. Pt. 2, Andrews. See also, State v. 
Duvernoy, 156 W. Va. 578, 582, 195 S.E.2d 631, 634 (1973) (""this Court has traditionally construed Article III, Section 6 in 
harmony with the Fourth Amendment."") "
953,12," In Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), abrogated in part by 
statute as recognized in Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) 
(Illinois Tool found statutory  [***47] changes necessitated conclusion that fact a tying product is patented does not support 
presumption of market power), the United States Supreme Court addressed the concept of ""tying"" under federal antitrust law in 
a case strikingly similar to the instant action as it involved a hospital's exclusive contract with an anesthesia provider. Therein the 
Supreme Court recognized that their: cases have concluded that the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its 
control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, 
or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms. When such ""forcing"" is present, competition on the 
merits in the market for the tied item is restrained and the Sherman Act is violated. Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12, 104 S. Ct. at 1558. The Supreme Court went on to note that tying arrangements are 
condemned ""when the seller has some special ability -- usually called ""market power"" to force a purchaser to do something that 
he would not do in a competitive market."" Further, ""Per se condemnation-condemnation without inquiry into actual 
 [***48] market conditions-is only appropriate if the existence of forcing is probable. . . . as a threshold matter there must be a 
substantial potential for impact on competition in order to justify per se condemnation."" Id. at 15-16, 104 S. Ct. at 1560. ""Tying"" 
arrangements are not condemned ""unless a substantial volume of commerce is foreclosed thereby."" Id. Finding the relevant 
market to be the geographical area and not the specific hospital, the Supreme Court upheld the contract against charges of 
antitrust violations. In Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc.,448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals summarized the concept of 
""tying"" under the Sherman Act as follows: In order to establish that there exists an unlawful tying arrangement plaintiffs must demonstrate First, that the scheme in 
question involves two distinct items and provides that one (the tying product) may not be obtained unless the other (the tied 
product) is also purchased. Second, that the tying product possesses sufficient economic power appreciably to restrain 
competition in the tied product market. Third, that a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce is affected by the arrangement. Siegel, 448 F.2d at 47  [***49] (internal citations omitted). The Ninth Circuit went on to note that ""[u]nder the per se theory of 
illegality, plaintiffs are required to establish not only the existence of a tying arrangement but also that the tying product 
possesses sufficient economic power to appreciably restrain free competition in the tied product markets."" Id. at 49. "
954,13," In footnote 7 of the majority opinion in Repass, the Court acknowledged that there was a dispute as to whether or not the rule 
at issue was a legislative rule.  The Court noted, however, that HN33[
] even if the rule had the “authority of a legislative rule, 
the deference we owe does not change.  Even when considering a legislative rule, under Appalachian Power Co. v. State Tax 
Department of West Virginia, 195 W. Va. 573, 466 S.E.2d 424 (1995), and its  [***53] progeny, when a statute is clear, we owe 
no deference to the agency’s rule.” "
955,14," We limit our analysis of W. Va. C.S.R. § 142-15-3 herein to its relationship with W. Va. Code § 47-18-3 as W. Va. Code § 47-
18-4 (1978) is not at issue in this litigation."
955,15," If W. Va. C.S.R. § 142-15-3 could reasonably be deemed an attempt to clarify ambiguity in W. Va. Code § 47-18-3 (b), then 
ordinary canons of statutory construction may be used to attempt to resolve any apparent conflict between the legislative rule 
and the initial statute. See Syl. Pt. 3, Boone Memorial."
955,16," Even if this Court were to have recognized ""tying"" as a type of per se violation of our antitrust law, the allegations herein are 
insufficient to trigger such per se status as that status has developed under federal law. See note 12, supra. "
967,1," For convenience we adopt the parties' use of the phrase “á la carte” to describe the unbundling of the services included in a tier 
of cable service, and offering them separately."
967,2," Plaintiffs cited no evidence to dispute the asserted fact that “Hall … was informed that a subscription to basic cable 
programming was required to receive cable music service.” Instead they objected only that Comcast “misquoted” his testimony 
because Hall's testimony referred to “certain video services” not to “basic cable.” The court overruled this objection. "
968,3," Although plaintiffs stated that they disputed this fact, they offered no evidence to dispute the availability of FM stations over the 
Internet. Instead they simply pointed out that although Belton testified that he knew FM stations were available over the Internet, 
he also stated he had not gone through the “elaborate process” to use his computer this way."
968,4," Although plaintiffs asserted this fact was disputed as to Belton, they cited the same deposition testimony that Comcast relied 
upon and disputed  [***6] only the assertion that Belton testified that three stations “are available easily over the air.” In the cited 
testimony Belton testified that he could get KPFA and KQED with a large outdoor antenna, and KRCB, a local station."
968,5," Plaintiffs stated they disputed the additional assertions of fact that the rate cards stated the correct price for FM service, and for 
DMX music, a digital music service that Hall ordered  [***7] in addition to basic cable, but cited only the cards themselves as 
their evidence. Plaintiffs offered no argument to explain how these cards misrepresented the price, and the court therefore 
concluded that they failed to create a triable issue of fact. "
969,6," In the proceedings below plaintiffs also alleged Comcast's practice violated other predicate statutes,  [***12] including Business 
and Professions Code sections 17509 and 17000, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; ADA) 
and the Cartwright Act (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 16720 & 16727). Yet, in their opening brief they did not raise any claim of error "
970,," with respect to the court's disposition of these claims. We therefore deem any contention based upon these predicate statutes to 
have been waived, and shall not consider plaintiffs' contentions based upon predicate violations of Business and Professions 
Code sections 17509, 16727 and 16720, which they reassert on appeal for the first time in their reply brief. (See, e.g., 
Neighbours v. Buzz Oates Enterprises (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 335, fn. 8 [265 Cal. Rptr. 788].) On appeal, plaintiffs also rely on violations of the CLRA as yet another predicate statute for their unfair competition claim. To 
avoid repetition, we shall address these arguments in the context of review of the motion that the separate cause of action for 
violation of the CLRA was without merit. (See fn. 17, post.)"
970,7," HN4[
] The mere sale of products packaged together, or refusal to sell such products separately, does not constitute unlawful 
tying. “[N]ot every refusal to sell two products separately can be said to restrain competition. If each of the products may be 
purchased separately in a competitive market, one seller's decision to sell the two in a single  [***15] package imposes no 
unreasonable restraint on either market, particularly if competing suppliers are free to sell either the entire package or its several 
parts.” (Jefferson Parish, supra, 466 U.S. at pp. 11–12.) “Buyers often find package sales attractive; a seller's decision to offer 
such packages can merely be an attempt to compete effectively—conduct that is entirely consistent with the Sherman Act.” 
(Ibid.) Recently, in Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc. (2006) 547 U.S. 28 [164 L. Ed. 2d 26, 126 S. Ct. 1281], the 
court reaffirmed that “[m]any tying arrangements, even those involving patents and requirements ties, are fully consistent with a 
free, competitive market.” (Id. at p. 1292.) "
971,8," Belton testified that he was never charged for a service he did not request. Hall testified that he ordered an additional tier of 
digital programming, understanding that music was only a part of the programming in that tier. "
972,9," Plaintiffs did not allege or contend below a claim of disparate treatment in the application of a facially neutral policy, which may 
be cognizable under the Act. (See Koebke v. Bernando Heights County Club, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 853.) Moreover, in their 
separate statement they did not dispute that Comcast treated Hall  [***23] the same as their sighted subscribers. "
973,10," This same analysis also supports the court order granting summary adjudication of the separate cause of action for a violation 
of the Act. "
974,11," In their reply brief plaintiffs also rely upon the ADA and the Act, and the federal law proscribing negative option billing, as a 
“tether” to a legislatively declared policy that they contend Comcast's practice violated. They assert in conclusory fashion that 
Comcast's practice was unfair because it violated the spirit, if not the letter, of each of these statutes, but offer no supporting 
argument or authorities other than for the general assertion that Business and Professions Code section 17200 claims have 
been based upon the Act and federal consumer protection statutes. We shall not consider this argument because they are 
raised for the first time in the reply. (Neighbours v. Buzz Oates Enterprises, supra, 217 Cal. App. 3d at p. 335, fn. 8.)"
974,12," The court ruled that plaintiffs failed to create a triable issue with respect to respondent's asserted fact that these cards did not 
misrepresent the price for FM and DMX service. Although this fact was disputed, the only evidence they cited was the cards 
themselves. We shall not consider plaintiffs' argument that two of the rate cards were confusing concerning the statement charges for digital 
(DMX) service, because  [***32] these arguments were not raised below. (See Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon 
Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472 [35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 200]; Munro v. Regents of University of California (1989) 215 Cal. 
App. 3d 977, 989 [263 Cal. Rptr. 878].) "
975,13," Of course, a “perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer, such as 
by failure to disclose other relevant information, is actionable.” (Consumer Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 
Cal.App.4th 1351, 1362 [8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 22].) Yet, in the proceedings below and on appeal plaintiffs fail to articulate in what 
respect the oral statement, even if truthful, might be misleading. "
976,14," Gulbransen, Comcast's regional vice-president, in a reply declaration, explained that in March 2005, Comcast discontinued 
FM service in Healdsburg and other northern California communities to free up bandwidth and enable Comcast to offer more 
high-definition digital and pay-per-view video programming options. She further declared that, in Santa Rosa, “due to certain 
franchise requirements, FM music service has not been dropped, and it is now offered on a stand-alone basis,” at “a price close 
to what is charged for the basic television tier of service.” "
978,15," Plaintiffs' contention in their reply brief that Comcast's policy also “shocked the conscience” because it violated the law against 
negative option billing (47 U.S.C. § 543) and was discriminatory in violation of section 51 of the Act is disposed of by our 
determination that the court properly granted summary adjudication of their unfair competition cause of action based upon 
alleged violation of these same predicate laws."
978,16," Indeed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in two separate reports, one of which was part of the record below, 
reached different conclusions about whether consumers would benefit from regulations requiring cable services to be provided 
“á la carte.” In a November 18, 2004 report entitled Report on the Packaging and Sale of Video Programming Services to the 
Public, the FCC stated, among other things, that such regulation could result in less diverse preprogramming and consumers 
having to pay more for fewer channels. In February 2006, a second report, entitled Further Report on the Packaging and Sale of 
Video Programming Services to the Public, however, identified  [***47] substantial benefits in terms of an increase of choices. 
(<http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-263740A1.pdf> [as of June 8, 2007].)"
978,17," These same reasons also support the conclusion that Comcast's practice was not “unlawful” within the meaning of Business 
and Professions Code section 17200, based upon a predicate violation of the CLRA. "
1000,1," See County of Milwaukee v. Williams, County of Milwaukee v. Hegney, 2006 WI App 153, 295 Wis. 2d 389, 720 N.W.2d 177 
(affirming judgments of the circuit court for Milwaukee County, Daniel L. Konkol, Judge). The court of appeals granted a motion 
by Williams and Hegney to consolidate their cases for appeal."
1000,2, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2005-06 version unless otherwise noted. 
1001,3," The Ordinance defines ""luxury limousine"" as: [A]  [****6] for-hire ground transportation vehicle, regularly engaged in the business of carrying passengers for hire, having 
a maximum seating capacity of six (6) persons, unless the size of the group dictates a larger vehicle, behind the driver and 
which is a top of the line American or foreign production or custom automobile designated by its manufacturer as a 
limousine and which has custom nonproduction features. Milw. County Ord. 4.05(6)(a)(2). "
1002,4," The petitioners appear to assert that Ordinance 4.05 creates an ""absolute"" ban on taxis providing prearranged service. There is 
nothing in the record that supports this claim, and they do not cite a provision in the Ordinance (or elsewhere) that sets forth 
such a prohibition. In fact, the Ordinance explicitly contemplates prearranged service by permitted taxis: ""Where prereserved 
(reservation) business is engaged in, driver shall check in with the ground transportation coordinator and provide the name(s), 
flight number(s) and arrival time(s) for the reserved passenger(s)."" Milw. County Ord. 4.05(3)(f)(7)."
1002,5," The petitioners do not argue that this case is about the County's ability to enact an ordinance that prohibits taxis without Airport 
permits from making prearranged pickups where that ordinance allows taxis with Airport permits to make such pickups. As noted 
above in footnote 4, they appear to assert without citation or support in the record that all taxis are prohibited from providing 
prearranged service at the Airport. "
1003,6," Wis. Stat. § 114.14(1) states: HN6[
] The governing body of a city, village, town or county which has established an airport or landing field, or landing 
and take-off strip, and acquired, leased or set apart real property for such purpose may construct, improve, equip, maintain 
and operate the same, or may vest jurisdiction for the construction, improvement, equipment, maintenance and operation 
thereof in any suitable officer, board or body of such city, village, town or county. The expenses of such construction, 
improvement, equipment, maintenance and operation shall be a city, village, town or county charge as the case may be. 
The governing body of a city, village, town or county may adopt  [****12] regulations, and establish fees or charges for the 
use of such airport or landing field, or may authorize an officer, board or body of such village, city, town or county having 
jurisdiction to adopt such regulations and establish such fees or charges, subject however to the approval of such 
governing body before they shall take effect. "
1004,7," A taxi that drops off passengers at the Airport is not doing business under the meaning of 4.05(3): A taxicab driver entering upon General Mitchell International Airport for the sole purpose of discharging a taxicab patron at 
said airport shall not be deemed to be doing business thereon if, after discharging said passenger, he/she shall immediately 
leave the airport premises. Milw. County Ord. 4.05(3)(b)(5)."
1004,8," ""[L]imousines must operate on a pre-reserved (reservation) basis only . . . ."" Milw. County Ord. 4.05(6)(a)(2). "
1005,9," The wording of Wis. Stat. § 114.14(3) was amended by 1999 Wis. Act 83, §§ 187-188. The changes do not affect the meaning 
of the statute for the purposes of the analysis here, and the language requiring that ""[t]he public may in no case be deprived of 
equal and uniform use of the airport"" was unchanged. "
1006,10," The County argues that the express language of § 114.14(3) subjects only the exercise of authority by the airport commission 
to the condition that the public may not be deprived of equal and uniform use. Because Ordinance 4.05 is an exercise of the 
County's authority, rather than an exercise of an airport commission's authority, the County contends that the requirement that 
the public not be deprived of equal and uniform use is not applicable. This is incorrect. HN17[
] Section 114.14(2)(a) provides that the ""governing body of a city, village, town or county which has established an airport may vest jurisdiction for the construction, improvement, equipment,  [****21] maintenance and operation of the airport in 
an airport commission. . . ."" Once such a governing body has vested jurisdiction for the operation of an airport in an airport 
commission, ""[t]he commission shall have complete and exclusive control and management over the airport for which it has 
been appointed."" Wis. Stat. § 114.14(2)(e). Thus, the legislature intended that counties and other municipalities could establish 
commissions with complete control over airports, and that such commissions could not exercise control so as to deprive the 
public of equal and uniform use of those airports. Here, the County has vested authority in an airport commission to operate the airport with ""complete and exclusive"" control. At 
the same time, however, it has promulgated a rule which arbitrarily deprives the public of equal and uniform airport use. The 
promulgation of such a rule allows the County to circumvent the statutory protection of the public's equal and uniform use of the 
Airport afforded by Wis. Stat. § 114.14(3)(b)1. Further, HN18[
] the County's authority to regulate the Airport is limited to the 
power conferred by the statute. Mommsen v. Schueller, 228 Wis. 2d 627, 634-35, 599 N.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1999)(citations 
 [****22] omitted). Nothing in § 114.14 can be read to confer or imply authority for the County to exercise its power arbitrarily, so 
as to deprive members of the public of equal and uniform use of airports."
1006,11," There is nothing in the stipulated facts that would counter the County's claim that the Ordinance has resolved the problems of 
the open system. The affidavits submitted by the petitioners address only the way that Quality Cab conducts its business and 
ways in which Ordinance 4.05 is anticompetitive. "
1007,12," The dissent asserts that the majority is forcing Milwaukee County to return to an open system. Dissent, P83. This assertion is 
incorrect and should not be allowed to cause confusion."
1007,13," Milwaukee County Ordinance 4.05(5)(a) also provides that ""out-of-county shuttle services"" may operate on a prearranged 
basis from the Airport: ""Out-of-county"" shuttle service, under this subsection shall mean a company, partnership or person which operates on a 
prereserved basis from General Mitchell International Airport to destinations beyond the county limits. "
1008,," The vehicle(s) which make up ""out-of-county"" shuttle service(s) shall be van(s) regularly engaged in the business of 
carrying passengers for hire, having a maximum seating capacity of twenty-two (22) persons behind the driver, with heating 
and air conditioning and be in good operating condition. Milw. County Ord. 4.05(5)(a). The record does not provide details about such services. It is unclear from the record whether 
such service operates in Fond du Lac. However, the possibility of prearranged van services does not affect the analysis here, for 
it does not provide a reason  [****28] for excluding taxis without Airport permits from providing prearranged services."
1008,14," Neither the affidavit nor the briefs cite to a statute or case law on this point. The County may be referring to Executive Town & 
Country Servs., Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 789 F.2d 1523, 1525-26 (11th Cir. 1986). In that case, the Eleventh Circuit determined 
that while taxis generally do not operate in the stream of interstate commerce, a limousine service that received the vast majority 
of its business from an international airport, received many of its incoming calls on 800 number lines, and served multi-national 
corporate clients was within the stream of interstate commerce. Id. at 1525-26. See also Charter Limousine, Inc. v. Dade County 
Bd. of County Comm'rs, 678 F.2d 586 (Former 5th Cir. 1982); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 231-32, 67 S. Ct. 
1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947). The dissent posits that the County is instead referring  [****30] to 49 U.S.C. § 14501(d). This seems unlikely because that 
statute clearly states that it does not limit airports from providing preferential access to providers of pre-arranged ground 
transportation services: (3) Matters not covered. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed- . . . (B) as prohibiting or restricting an airport, train, or bus terminal operator from contracting to provide preferential access or 
facilities to one or more providers of pre-arranged ground transportation service . . . . 49 U.S.C. § 14501(d)(3) (2006). "
1009,15," Wis. Stat. § 133.03 no longer applies ""to ambulance service contracted for under ss. 59.54(1), 60.565, 61.64 and 62.133."" 
Wis. Stat. § 133.03(4). "
1010,16," We note, too, that § 133.01 expressly applies to ""state regulatory agencies."" We decline to address whether Milwaukee 
County is a state regulatory agency under § 133.01."
1010,17," Wis. Stat. § 349.24  [****38] provides in relevant part: HN27[
] Authority to license taxicab operators and taxicabs. (1) The council of any city and every village or town board 
may: (a) Regulate and license chauffeurs and operators of taxicabs used for hire; (b) Regulate and license the taxicab business by licensing each taxicab used for hire; (c) Prohibit any person from operating any motor vehicle for taxicab purposes upon the highways of the city, village or town 
unless the person is licensed as a chauffeur and operator and unless the taxicab business is licensed by the licensing of 
each taxicab; (d) Revoke any license mentioned in this section when in its judgment the public safety so requires. (2) Any person licensed by any city, village or town as a chauffeur and operator shall not be required to procure either a 
chauffeur's and operator's license or a taxicab license in any other municipality for the purpose of carrying taxicab "
1011,," passengers for hire from one municipality to another, but this exception does not permit the chauffeur or operator to operate 
a taxicab wholly within the limits of any municipality in which the chauffeur or operator is not licensed."
1011,18," Wis. Stat. §§ 194.01(2), (11). "

1016,20," 49 U.S.C. § 14501(d) (1955), reads as follows: (d) Pre-arranged ground transportation.-- (1) In general.--No State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency, or other political agency of 2 or more 
States shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard or other provision having the force and effect of law "
1017,," requiring a license or fee on account of the fact that a motor vehicle is providing pre-arranged ground transportation service 
if the motor carrier providing such service-- (A) meets all applicable registration requirements under chapter 139 for the interstate transportation of passengers; (B) meets all applicable vehicle and intrastate passenger licensing requirements of the State or States in which the motor 
carrier is domiciled or registered to do business; and (C)  [****59] is providing such service pursuant to a contract for-- (i) transportation by the motor carrier from one State, including intermediate stops, to a destination in another State; or (ii) transportation by the motor carrier from one State, including intermediate stops in another State, to a destination in the 
original State. "
1018,*," Honorable Donald E. Walter, United States District Judge for the Western District of Louisiana, sitting by designation. "
1050,1," The Court suggests that the argument advanced in my opinion was not preserved by respondents.  See ante, at 275, 168 L. 
Ed. 2d, at 155.  Respondents' principal contention in the Court of Appeals below was that ""[t]he federal securities laws do not 
expressly immunize Defendants' alleged conduct from prosecution under the federal antitrust laws.""  See, e.g., Brief for 
Appellants in No. 03-9288 (CA2), pp 15-16.  Because a full reading of the securities laws is essential to analyzing respondents' 
central argument, I do not consider arguments based on the saving clauses unpreserved.  Cf. United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 
822, 828, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1984) (""[W]e read statutes as a whole""). "
1051,2," The Court's suggestion that the clauses were intended to save only securities-related rights and remedies is subject to many of 
the same criticisms.  See ante, at 275, 168 L. Ed. 2d, at 155-156.  The Securities Act of 1933 provided no private federal remedy 
for fraud in the purchase or sale of registered securities.  On the Court's proposed reading of § 77p, however, a federal action for 
mail or wire fraud and a state-law action for fraud, which are not securities-related rights or remedies, would not have been 
included within the Securities Act's saving provision. "
1057,1," The Honorable John F. Nangle, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, sitting by designation."
1057,2," The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri. "
1091,1," Defendants Diageo PLC and Pernod-Ricard S.A. do not move for dismissal at this time. However, all of the parties have 
stipulated that Diageo PLC and Pernod-Ricard S.A. (1) will be bound by the court's decision with respect to the instant motions 
and (2) may move for dismissal on grounds not raised in the instant motions once they are decided. "
1093,2," The exhibits to the James Affidavit are not set off from the James Affidavit with tabs. However, both the James Affidavit and 
exhibits thereto are Exhibit 6 of the Acevedo Declaration. As a result, the court will cite to exhibits to the James Affidavit as 
""Acevedo Decl. Exh. 6."" "
1099,3," As discussed in detail below in the Section addressing the penal law rule, the distinction between injuries that a sovereign 
suffers in its sovereign capacity and injuries a sovereign suffers in a commercial capacity is also supported by federal case law 
addressing the penal law rule. As the penal law rule and revenue rule are analogous, the penal law jurisprudence supports such 
a distinction in the context of the revenue rule. "
1103,4," Although the exact nature of the so-called ""monopoly participations"" is not clear, they appear to be another consumption tax. 
Under Colombian law, each Department has the choice of (1) exploiting its liquor monopoly or (2) imposing a consumption tax 
on liquor. (Plazas Decl. P 15.) If a Department opts to exploit its liquor monopoly, it ""may collect a 'participation' from liquors 
instead of the consumption tax[.]"" (Id. P 23.) Although Plazas's description of the ""monopoly participation"" is less than clear 
(perhaps because of an imperfect translation of Plazas's declaration), Defendants explain that a monopoly participation is 
essentially a consumption tax by another name: ""Where a Department chooses to exploit the monopoly, the Department will 
charge a monopoly 'participation' on every bottle of liquor introduced into its territory 'instead of the consumption tax.'"" (Def. FNC 
Mem. at 19 (quoting, Plazas Decl. P 23).) Colombian law requires the monopoly participation to be no lower than the 
consumption. (Plazas Decl. P 23 n.10.) In fact the only distinction between the consumption tax and the monopoly participation 
that the court can discern is that a centralized Colombian government agency collects the consumption tax, whereas the 
individual Departments collect the monopoly participations."
1103,5," These eighteen categories of injury are: failure of Defendants' smuggled products to bear labels with the information required 
by Colombian law; ""adverse economic impact"" of the Colombian ""underground economy;"" ""eros[ion] of the stability and 
credibility"" of the Colombian peso; ""[d]istortion of the [m]oney supply;"" distort[ion] [of] the official balance of payments;"" 
""permeation of the Colombian border and the Territory of the Republic;"" threat to the ""safety, security, and well-being of 
governmental personnel and property;"" interference with ""the regulatory system and authority of the Republic;"" ""disruption of 
public services;"" ""expenses to stabilize unstable political situations in entire regions of Colombia;"" damage to the Colombian 
""trade and the economy;"" ""interfere[nce] with use by the public of a public space;"" ""endanger[ment] and injur[y] [to] the property, 
life, health, safety, and comfort of a considerable number of persons;"" ""injur[y] [to] the economic well being of the citizens of the 
Republic of Colombia and the Departments;"" ""creat[ing] great dangers to the community, including Plaintiffs' economic and non-
economic interests;"" and ""fraud on the public."" (Def. FNC Rep. at 31-32.) "
1104,6," Although no party has made this argument, an economist might argue that, at least in some contexts, a sovereign's decision to 
create a state-owned monopoly for a particular good is functionally equivalent to enacting a sales tax on that good: in a state-
owned monopoly, the government can set prices so as to obtain a monopoly profit, whereas a sales tax may be simply another 
means of receiving revenue that is often similar or equal in value to the monopoly profit. As a result, under this court's reading of 
the revenue rule, foreign sovereigns may be able to do an end run around the revenue rule by creating a state-owned monopoly 
that sells a good or service as opposed to taxing a good or service. In certain markets, creating a state-owned monopoly and 
charging a monopoly price may be able to provide the sovereign with the same or similar net revenue and have similar effects 
on supply, demand, and other market characteristics as would charging a sales tax. This problem is more theoretical than real. 
The political and public policy issues surrounding a sovereign's decision as to whether to tax a good or service or simply create a 
state-owned monopoly are typically of far greater importance than whether a foreign sovereign can bring claims related to that 
good or service in United States federal courts. It is very hard to imagine a scenario in which a sovereign would create a state-
owned monopoly for the exclusive purpose of bringing an action concerning that business in federal court. "
1105,7," It is important to note one apparent inconsistency between this court's analysis of the direct and indirect enforcement 
components of the revenue rule. With respect to direct enforcement, the court concludes that revenues the Colombian 
government earns from its liquor monopoly are earned by the government in a commercial as opposed to a sovereign capacity. 
In effect, the court concludes that revenue generated by the monopoly law is not ""revenue"" within the meaning of the revenue 
rule. With respect to indirect enforcement, however, this court treats the law that authorizes the liquor monopoly as a ""revenue"" 
law for purposes of the revenue rule: the court's analysis strongly suggests that, if Plaintiffs' claims required the court to pass on 
the validity of the monopoly law, the revenue rule would be violated. Despite appearances, there is no inconsistency here. As 
discussed above, application of the revenue rule must be based on the policy purposes underlying the rule. There are no policy 
concerns with allowing the foreign sovereign to bring a claim for damages suffered in its commercial capacity. There are, 
however, policy concerns with a federal court's passing on the validity of a foreign law that authorizes a state-owned monopoly. "
1107,8," Defendants argue that, under Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 
(1992), and Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 126 S. Ct. 1991, 164 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2006), when Plaintiffs' claims 
are stripped of the tax evasion aspect of the alleged enterprise, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs cannot prove that the enterprise's 
money laundering was the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries. This argument will be considered below in the context of 
Defendants' numerous arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. "
1108,9," Colombia and the United States do appear to be negotiating a trade agreement. (See Trade Promotion Agreement, U.S.-
Colomb., 
draft 
of 
May 
8, 
2006 
(""Trade 
Draft""), 
available 
at http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Colombia_FTA/Draft_Text/Section_Index.html; see also Def. FNC Rep. at 101-
02.) It is not possible, however, to divine the Executive or Legislative branch's position, if any, on Colombian liquor taxation from 
this draft treaty."
1108,10," Defendants also argue that tax agreements between Columbia and the United States, which do not provide for United States 
courts to hear adjudicated or unadjudicated Colombian tax claims, further suggest that the revenue rule bars this claim. (Def. 
FNC Mem. at 47.) Defendants are correct about the existence and substance of tax agreements between Colombia and the 
United States. (Plazas Decl. P 24, n.11.) Defendants may be correct that, when a court is considering a revenue rule issue, the 
existence of such tax agreements is noteworthy: It seems to us that the usual absence in our negotiated tax conventions of any provision for the extraterritorial enforcement 
of a sovereign's tax judgments or claims cannot be not accidental, but instead must reflect the considered policy of the 
political branches of our government. Thus, the political branches of our government have clearly expressed their intention 
to define and strictly limit the parameters of any assistance given with regard to the extraterritorial enforcement of a foreign 
sovereign's tax laws. In this area of foreign relations policy where the political branches have primacy, courts must be wary 
of intruding in a way that undermines carefully conceived and negotiated policy choices. Canada, 268 F.3d at 119. This reasoning, however, was called into question in the Supreme Court's decision in Pasquantino. 
See European Community II, 424 F.3d at 182 n.9. In any event, as this court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims for damages 
resulting only from the alleged enterprise's laundering of proceeds of narcotics sales neither constitutes enforcement of a 
Colombian tax law nor requires the court to consider the validity of Colombian tax or revenue laws, this point is inapposite. "
1109,11," Defendants argue that the Republic of Colombia, the Bogota Capital District, and those Departments that do not exercise their 
right to a liquor monopoly suffer no competitive harm. (Def. RICO Mem. at 29-31.) To the extent these Plaintiffs suffer no injury 
in their commercial capacity--as defined in the revenue rule section of this opinion--these Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the 
revenue rule and, as a result, are dismissed. "
1113,12," It appears that Colombian courts may not possess personal jurisdiction over the two non-U.S. Defendants, Pernod-Ricard S.A. 
and Diageo PLC. No party has asserted that Colombian courts possess personal jurisdiction over them. Of course, these two 
Defendants, which are not parties to the instant motions, assert that this court does not possess personal jurisdiction over them. 
In the event this court determines it possesses personal jurisdiction over these two Defendants, Plaintiffs' decision to bring suit in 
this forum would be supported by yet another legitimate consideration. See Norex, 416 F.3d at 155 (""Notably, it appears doubtful 
from the record that [plaintiff] could have perfected jurisdiction over all defendants in either of its presumptively convenient home 
forums, Canada or Cyprus, or even in defendants' preferred forum, Russia. Thus, [plaintiff's] decision to litigate in New York, "
1114,," where all defendants were amenable to suit (and where some reside or are incorporated) is properly viewed as a strong 
indicator that convenience, and not tactical harassment of an adversary, informed its decision to sue outside its home forum.""). "
1116,13," Defendants identify several categories of damages included in the Second Amended Complaint that are based virtually 
exclusively on evidence that is to be found in Colombia. (Def. FNC Mem. at 73.) As discussed above in the Section addressing 
the revenue rule, virtually all (if not all) of these categories of damages are barred by the revenue rule. As a result, evidence 
concerning these categories of damages will not be relevant to the adjudication of this case. Similarly, as discussed in the 
revenue rule Section, this case does not require the court to pass upon the validity of Colombian tax laws and, as a result, 
evidence concerning the validity of such laws is not pertinent. (See Def. FNC Mem. at 74.) "
1117,14," In Piper Aircraft Company v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 258, 102 S. Ct. 252, 267, 70 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1981), the Supreme Court 
explained that HN50[
] a defendant need not ""submit affidavits identifying the witnesses they would call and the testimony 
these witnesses would provide if the trial were held in the alternative forum"" but the defendant ""must provide enough information 
to enable the District Court to balance the parties' interests."" Of course, identifying third-party witnesses is different from "
1118,," identifying third parties that a defendant wishes to implead. This is particularly true in this case where Defendants appear to be 
aware of the identities of narcotics traffickers and other individuals and entities within their distribution chains."
1118,15," Defendants cite Usha (India), Ltd. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., No. 03 Civ. 0494 (DC), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4236, 2004 WL 
540441 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2004), for the proposition that the fact that a United States corporation controlled foreign business 
activities does not mean that the United States has an interest in the dispute. (Def. FNC Rep. at 87.) Usha is distinguishable 
because ""Usha's claims are based on issues of Indian corporate governance, the duties between shareholders of Indian 
corporations, and the duties between joint venture partners under Indian partnership law."" Usha, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4236, 
2004 WL 540441, at *7. In contrast, this case is about whether Defendants violated U.S. money laundering and related laws. "
1121,16," Defendants also point to an action pending in the Andean Court of Justice that ""has considered the Colombian taxation 
scheme and found it to be anti-competitive."" (Bravo Decl. P 13.) However, Defendants acknowledge that nothing about that case 
suggests that Defendants' liquor monopoly is somehow inconsistent with Colombian or international law: ""The Andean Court of 
Justice ruled that, given their nature as a mechanism for raising public revenue, the mere constitutional authorization of liquor 
monopolies did not itself violate Andean Community law, but that the Colombian taxation regime and the manner in which the 
sale of imported goods is made 'more difficult or more costly than goods produce nationally,' did violate Colombian law 
proscriptions on anticompetitive discrimination against imported goods."" (Def. FNC Mem. at 21-22.) "
1128,17," As Plaintiffs have successfully satisfied the ""conduct test,"" there is no reason for this court to reach the ""effects test"" or the 
""precious resources test."" (See Pl. RICO Opp. at 15.)"
1128,18," Plaintiffs cite World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. v. Jakks Pacific, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 2d 484, 493-500 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), which 
read Turkette and a number of Second Circuit cases to state that a RICO plaintiff need not prove a RICO enterprise that is 
separate from a pattern of racketeering activity. (Pl. RICO Opp. at 39.) As it is not material to the outcome of this decision, the 
court will assume, without deciding, that Plaintiffs must establish both a pattern of racketeering activity and a RICO enterprise 
that is separate from that activity. "
1131,19," Dale v. Banque SCS Alliance S.A., No. 02 Civ. 3592 (RCC) (KNF), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20967, 2005 WL 2347853, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2005), relied upon by Defendants, is also inapposite. In Dale, the court found that an association-in-fact 
enterprise was not separate from the pattern of racketeering activity where plaintiffs failed to allege as such. "
1134,20," In their initial moving brief, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs failed to allege that they had standing to bring a RICO claim. (Def. 
RICO Mem. at 21-22.) In their Reply brief, Defendants characterize very similar (if not identical) arguments as an assertion that 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege proximate cause. (Def. RICO Rep. at 14-15.) As a result, the court will treat this argument as a 
proximate cause argument. "
1137,21," In a footnote, Defendants argue that ""the United States is another entity that could be expected to pursue these Defendants."" 
(Def. RICO Rep. at 28.) Although the United States could bring a criminal case against Defendants, the United States has not 
suffered a direct financial injury in the way that the State of New York had in Anza. "
1138,22," Defendants' reliance on First Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 (2d Cir. 2004), is misplaced. In that case, 
the Second Circuit held that a civil RICO case alleging that a lender was fraudulently induced to make loans on the basis of 
intentionally inflated valuations should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) because the plaintiff failed to plead proximate cause. Id. 
at 769-72. Gelt Funding is distinguishable on a number of grounds. First, the Second Circuit appeared to require the plaintiff to 
plead a methodology for calculating damages that was far more specific than is typically required on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion 
because the plaintiffs had lost money on real estate loans in the midst of a crash in the real estate market: ""Given the complexity 
of the New York real estate market, and the fact that [plaintiff's] losses came in the wake of a downturn in the real estate market, 
[plaintiff] must allege loss causation with sufficient particularity such that we can determine whether the factual basis for its claim, 
if proven, could support an inference of proximate cause."" Id. at 770. The court ultimately concluded that ""[t]he methodology 
employed by [plaintiff] in determining the magnitude of the defendants' alleged[ly fraudulent] overstatements of income is so 
defective, and the conclusions reached so defy logic, that no 'reasonable inferences' can be drawn therefrom."" Id. at 772. Here, 
there is no reason to require Plaintiffs to plead a specific methodology for proving causation and damages and, thus, the 
Plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences. Second, in Gelt Funding, there was a five-year difference 
between the time of the alleged misstatements and the time of the losses whereas, in the instant case, the losses are alleged to 
occur more or less contemporaneously. Id. Finally, in Gelt Funding, the Second Circuit pointed to the real estate crash that had 
occurred in the relevant market during the relevant five-year period as an intervening factor that tended to disrupt any inference 
of proximate causation. Id. In the instant case, Defendants have not pointed the court to any intervening variable of even 
remotely similar magnitude. "
1140,23," It is not entirely clear that Plaintiffs need to establish that Defendants controlled every sale in the distribution chain in order to 
recover: if Plaintiffs establish that Defendants controlled a sale to a distributor located in whole or in part in Colombia, Plaintiffs 
may be able to show that the enterprise caused Defendant to lose revenues and/or profits. At this time, the parties have not 
briefed this issue and there is no reason for the court to reach it. "
1141,24," Although P 27(n) states at one point that Defendants 'knew or should have known' that one individual was a narcotics trafficker 
and that he used certain companies for money laundering, this paragraph also alleges that Defendants had actual knowledge 
that some of their customers were narcotics traffickers. "
1143,25," In Anza, the Supreme Court specifically declined to reach the question of whether a RICO plaintiff had to show reliance. Anza, 
126 S. Ct. at 1998 (""Because Ideal has not satisfied the proximate-cause requirement articulated in Holmes, we have no 
occasion to address the substantial question whether a showing of reliance is required.""). As a result, this court remains bound 
by the Second Circuit's holding in Anza that a RICO plaintiff must show reliance by the plaintiff or a third party. "
1144,26," Defendants raise these arguments in two separate sections of their brief. (Def. RICO Mem. at 58-71.) In one of those sections 
in Defendants' moving brief, Defendants assert that the state law claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentations, conversion, 
money had and received, public nuisance, and unjust enrichment have not been plead with the particularity required under Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 9(b). (Def. RICO Mem. at 63.) In their Reply Brief, Defendants appear to change their position, stating that the state 
law fraud claim is subject to Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements, but that the claims for negligent representation, conversion, 
money had and received, public nuisance, and unjust enrichment ""potentially"" fall under Rule 9(b). (Def. RICO Rep. at 50.) In 
any event, other than these blanket statements, Defendants do not address the Plaintiffs' state law claims. Defendants do not 
identify the elements of these state law claims or explain how the Second Amended Complaint fails to plead them. On this basis, 
the court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the state law claims on Rule 9(b) grounds."
1144,27," Paragraph 27(l) does not explicitly state that the communications alleged therein were made through United States mail or 
wires. Arguably, it is possible to read this allegation in connection with the numerous allegations concerning use of United States 
wires and mails and, in doing so, draw a reasonable inference that at least some of the false statements made to the Colombian 
government were made with the use of United States wires and mails. This court, however, need not reach this question 
because, as discussed below, the Second Amended Complaint contains numerous other allegations that specifically cite to use 
of the United States wires and mail. "
1146,28," Defendants cite Blue Cross & Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 113 F. Supp. 2d 345, 369-70 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) 
(health insurer's reliance unreasonable as a matter of law), and Grumman Allied Indus., Inc. v. Rohr Indus., Inc., 748 F.2d 729, 
737-38 (2d Cir. 1984) (dealing with ""sophisticated businessmen""). (Def. RICO Mem. at 62-63.) In Blue Cross, Judge Weinstein 
granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether a sophisticated insurance company's reliance upon a 
tobacco company's allegedly fraudulent campaign denying negative health effects of smoking was reasonable. Judge 
Weinstein's decision was fact-specific: the insurer had a ""large corps of doctors, bio-technicians, and other health care experts"" 
capable of learning the health effects of smoking; the insurer had a ""strong financial interest in discovering"" the health effects; as 
a provider of medical care, the insurer most likely had ""first-hand information on the negative health effects of smoking [and] the 
opportunity to catalogue and study the rates and patterns of injuries being suffered by smokers"". Id. at 369-70. Because this 
court confronts the reasonableness of Plaintiffs' reliance on a motion to dismiss, the court simply does not, at this time, have a 
factual basis for determining how sophisticated Plaintiffs are with respect to detecting, investigating or understanding the type of 
multinational RICO enterprise at issue in this case. "
1151,29," Shortly after this case was filed, the parties entered into a series of stipulations effectively staying this action while the United 
States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered the European Community 
cases and other cases involving the revenue rule. Oral argument on the instant motions was held in February and March of this 
year."
1151,30," The briefs filed in support of and opposition to this motion were unduly long. Any subsequent requests for an extension of the 
page limits contained in this court's Individual Rules should include (1) a brief but detailed description of why the legal and/or 
factual issues are sufficiently complex so as to justify the extension and (2) an estimate of how many pages will be dedicated to 
each legal issue. "
1160,1," The Honorable Joseph Bataillon, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. "
1161,2," On appeal, in addition to his counseled briefs, Stanko has filed two pro se ""Petition[s] for Great Writ of Habeas Corpus"" in 
which he advances additional arguments as to why his convictions should be overturned. We construe these filings as 
supplemental pro se briefs and decline to address them. See United States v. Peck, 161 F.3d 1171, 1174 n.2 (8th Cir. 1998) 
(HN3[
] ""It is not our practice to consider pro se briefs filed by parties represented by counsel . . . ."") (internal citation omitted). "
1162,3," We also necessarily conclude that HN9[
] Stanko's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury was not violated by the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on the § 921(a)(20)(A) exclusion. Stanko's reliance on United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 
115 S. Ct. 2310, 132 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1995), is misplaced. Gaudin held that a trial judge must submit instructions to the jury on 
every element of the crime charged, which included the element of the ""materiality"" of Gaudin's false statements on Department 
of Housing and Urban Development loan documents. Id. at 511, 522-23. By contrast here, because the § 921(a)(20)(A) 
exclusion is not an element of a § 922(g)(1) offense, Gaudin does not require the jury to be instructed on the exclusion. "
1163,4," Until a 1986 amendment to the statute, § 921(a)(20)(A) read ""or similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices 
as the Secretary may by regulation designate."" 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20)(A) (1968), amended by Pub. L. No. 99-308 (1986) 
(emphasis added). Our research has not revealed any offense so designated by the Secretary under this prior version, nor any 
indication of Congress's rationale for deleting that language."
1163,5," Even if we were to find ambiguity in the language of § 921(a)(20)(A), as suggested by Stanko, the application of the established 
maxim of statutory construction ejusdem generis would also support our interpretation. HN15[
] Ejusdem generis provides that 
""[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only 
objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words."" Circuit City Stores, Inc., v. Adams, 532 
U.S. 105, 114-15, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001) (quotation omitted). In considering a phrase in the Federal 
Arbitration Act that excluded from the Act's coverage ""contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other 
class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce,"" id. at 109, the Court concluded that the residual clause ""should 
itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it,"" id. at 115. 
The same principle would apply here. HN16[
] Congress chose to enumerate three types of offenses that qualify for the §"
1163,921," (a)(20)(A) exclusion and to add the residual clause ""or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices."" 
Were we to assume that the business practices clause is ambiguous, we would still conclude under the doctrine of ejusdem 
generis that the clause must be ""controlled and defined"" by reference to the enumerated offenses. See id. In addition, Stanko's argument that any ambiguity in the statute requires resolution in his favor under the rule of lenity 
misinterprets the reach of that rule. See Bernitt v. Martinez, 432 F.3d 868, 869 (8th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (HN17[
] ""We do 
not resort to the rule of lenity where, as here, we can otherwise resolve the ambiguity of the statute.""). We also reject Stanko's "
1164,," argument that the exclusion is unconstitutionally vague. See United States v. Bamberg, 478 F.3d 934, 937 (8th Cir. 2007) 
(HN18[
] ""The statute, first, must provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct, and second, not lend itself to arbitrary 
enforcement.""). "
1166,6," HN33[
] An ""intent to defraud"" is not required for conviction under the FMIA. When an intent to defraud is present, as in Stanko's convictions, the potential criminal punishment for the violation increases. See 21 U.S.C. § 676(a) (any violation of any 
provision of the FMIA subjects a person to imprisonment ""for not more than one year, or a fine of not more than $ 1,000, or both 
such imprisonment and fine; but if such violation involves intent to defraud . . . such person . . . shall be subject to imprisonment 
for not more than three years or a fine of not more than $ 10,000, or both . . . .""). "
1168,7," The majority includes United States v. Meldish, 722 F.2d 26 (2d Cir. 1983) in its catalogue of cases that have examined § 
921(a)(20)(A)'s exemption. Meldish held that the crime of importation by means of a false customs declaration, 18 U.S.C. § 542, 
is not an unfair trade practices crime, and that determination provides some guidance. But, the case is unhelpful as an example 
of crimes not included in the similar offenses clause because Meldish analyzed the § 921(a)(20)(A) exemptions prior to 1986, 
when the Secretary was the gatekeeper of the similar offenses clause. It is at least possible that a court, examining the crime 
today, could conclude that § 542 offenses do not prohibit an unfair trade practice but are within the judicially constructed set of 
similar offenses. "
1169,8," Stanko attempted but failed to get a final adjudication of his rights in a non-criminal setting. He sought a declaratory judgment 
that his FMIA offense was within the scope of § 921(a)(20), which a district court denied on the merits, but the Ninth Circuit 
vacated the court's order because Stanko had not, at that time, suffered a harm and thus lacked standing. See Stanko v. United 
States, No. 95-35289, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 24556, 1995 WL 499524 (9th Cir. Aug. 22, 1995) (unpublished opinion). The Ninth 
Circuit's decision highlights the concern I express in this dissent: our system of laws should not accept a statute so vague that an 
individual must suffer the harm of a § 922(g) conviction before learning from the courts whether his prior conviction falls within 
the scope of § 921(a)(20)'s exemptions. "
1183,1," The plaintiffs also allege a claim for ""money  [**5] had and received."" This claim was ultimately dismissed by the district court, 
who concluded this theory was indistinguishable from the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim. On appeal, the plaintiffs state the 
district court erred in dismissing their claim for money had and received, but make no argument with respect to this theory and 
cite no authorities to support this statement distinct from their briefing of the unjust enrichment claim. We therefore do not 
separately consider or discuss the plaintiffs' theory of money had and received. "
1195,1," The plaintiffs also submit that the no-hire provision offends public policy because it violates the Thirteenth Amendment's 
prohibition on slavery and involuntary servitude by preventing the plaintiffs from seeking employment with Bank One. We deem 
this contention frivolous and shall not address it further. "
1196,2," The plaintiffs cite Fort Wayne Cleaners & Dryers Ass'n v. Price, 127 Ind. App. 13, 137 N.E.2d 738 (Ind. Ct. App. 1956) (en 
banc), for the proposition that a party may pursue both common law and statutory actions for restraint of trade. Although Fort 
Wayne Cleaners involved both common law and statutory claims, nothing in the decision suggests that the common law claims 
were for the tort of restraint of trade. A close reading of the case suggests that the common law claims in that case were for 
tortious interference with business relations, a separate tort that remains actionable in Indiana. See id. at 741-42 (""There can be 
no doubt in [Indiana] that it is an actionable wrong to interfere, either directly or indirectly, with the business of another without 
cause or justification . . . ."")."
1196,3," Section 510 provides, in pertinent part: HN10[
] It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a 
participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan . . . 
or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the 
plan . . . ."
1196,29, U.S.C. § 1140. 
1200,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3. 
1246,1," For purposes of the instant motion, Plaintiffs include Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. (hereinafter collectively 
""Plaintiffs""). "
1247,2," The operative complaint is the Consolidated Class Action Complaint, filed on May 10, 2006, hereinafter referred to as 
""Complaint."" In the instant Opinion, the Court addresses only Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint filed by Jabo's 
Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. Defendant has filed separate motions to dismiss the complaints of other parties to 
this multidistrict litigation, which have been decided by the Court by way of separate opinions."
1247,3," The Court decides this  [*4] matter without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78. Jurisdiction is premised on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 
1337, and 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
1247,4," For purposes of the instant motion to dismiss, the Court accepts Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true, and relies only on the 
Complaint. See, e.g., Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 222 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (HN1[
] ""In deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally consider only the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, 
matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim."")."
1247,5," Defendant has also moved to dismiss (1) the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Louisiana 
Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., Rochester  [*5] Drug Co-Operative, Inc., JM Smith d/b/a Smith Drug Company, Dik Drug 
Company, American Sales Company, Inc., Park Surgical Co. Inc. and SAJ Distributors, Inc., and (2) the Class Action Amended 
Complaint filed by Medstar Health, Inc., Medstar-Georgetown Medical Center, Inc., Washington Hospital Center Corporation and 
National Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc. As previously indicated, the foregoing motions will not be addressed herein. "
1250,6," In doing so, a court may look only to the facts alleged in the complaint and any accompanying attachments, and may not look 
at the record. See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994). "
1251,7," In so holding, the United States Supreme Court rejected the language previously used by the Court in Conley v. Gibson, 
providing that ""[i]n appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not 
be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of 
his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). See Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. 
at 1964, 1974 (holding that the Conley ""no set of facts"" language ""has earned its retirement"" and ""is best forgotten."")."
1251,8," See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d 517 (D.N.J. 2004); In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litig., 157 F.Supp.2d 
355, 359 (D.N.J. 2001)."
1251,9," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) provides that HN5[
] ""[a] pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a 
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."""
1251,10," See also Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n. 17, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 
(1983) (stating that HN6[
] ""a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a 
potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.""). "
1252,11," In doing so, the Court is cognizant of the fact that HN8[
] ""a  [*22] formulaic recitation of a cause of action's elements"" alone 
will not sustain Plaintiffs' obligation to provide the grounds of their entitlement to relief. Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1959. "
1253,12," Given the foregoing allegations, the Court finds ""plausible grounds to infer an agreement"" between Defendant and certain 
GPOs and/or manufactures. Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1965. See generally Elder--Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dep't 
Stores, Inc., 459 F.2d 138, 146 (6th Cir. 1972) (HN14[
] ""The granting of exclusive selling rights or acceptance of such 
exclusive selling rights, acts which are not prohibited by law unless there is a resulting foreclosure of market alternatives cannot, 
without proof of such foreclosure, form the basis for a jury verdict that the defendants had entered into a conspiracy to restrain 
trade.""). "
1254,13," See, e.g., SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056, 1065 (3d Cir. 1978) (finding that ""the act of willful acquisition and 
maintenance of monopoly power was brought about by linking products on which Lilly faced no competition Keflin and Keflex 
with a competitive product, Kefzol. The result was to sell all three products on a non-competitive basis in what would have 
otherwise been a competitive market for Ancef and Kefzol. The effect of the Revised CSP was to force SmithKline to pay 
rebates on one product, Ancef, equal to rebates paid by Lilly based on volume sales of three products."")."
1254,14," See generally Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc., 113 F.3d at 415 (""Thus, SER must allege that PP & L unlawfully acquired 
monopoly power or had a dangerous probability of unlawfully achieving monopoly power in its service area. To do this, SER 
must allege that PP & L in some way acted to exclude SER as a competitor in the delivery of electricity to customers in PP & L's 
service area.""). "
1255,15," In particular,  [*34] Defendant argues that ""as a matter of federal law, safety and conventional devices are not 
interchangeable"" and thus cannot be part of the same relevant market. (Def. Br. at 8). Even if Defendant is ultimately correct, the 
Court declines to engage in any such analysis at this time. See, e.g., Ansell, Inc. v. Schmid Labs, Inc., 757 F. Supp. 467 (D.N.J. 
1991) (defining relevant product market after multi-day hearing, including expert testimony)."
1255,16," Moreover, Defendant's reliance on E. & G. Gabriel v. Gabriel Bros., Inc., -- a case which is not binding on this Court and 
distinguishable on a number of levels -- is misplaced. No. 93-0894, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9455, 1994 WL 369147, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. July 13, 1994) (finding plaintiff's proposed market, comprised of ""products as varied as household hardwares and 
children's sleepwear,"" to be implausible, and reasoning that ""[h]ammers are obviously not reasonable substitutes for children's 
pajamas, they are not used for similar purposes, nor will the price of hammers affect the price of pajamas.""). "
1256,17," Throughout its papers, Defendant relies on a number of cases, which are not binding on this Court, for the proposition that 
Plaintiffs' have failed to plead with the requisite ""particularity"" or ""specificity."" The Court has reviewed these decisions and finds 
that such cases do not warrant dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims on such a basis at this time. See, e.g., JM Computer Servs. v. 
Schlumberger Techs., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21885, 1996 WL 241607, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 1996) (granting defendant's 
motion to dismiss a § 2 claim where plaintiff (1) failed to ""identify the specific products or services in product markets for which 
Plaintiff claims there is no price elasticity,"" (2) failed to ""identify an agreement with a specific person or entity,"" and (3) ""does not 
identify the parts, services, or contracts involved in the alleged exclusive dealing""). Defendant  [*38] also relies heavily on the Third Circuit's decision in Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding Inc., 824 F.2d 223, 
230-31 (3d Cir. 1987). The Court has reviewed the Garshman decision and finds that the deficiencies alleged by Defendant in 
this case do not rise to the level of those contemplated by the Third Circuit in Garshman, where the complaint, itself, failed to 
allege any ""adverse effect on competition in any relevant market."" Id. at 231 (stating that ""[t]he allegation of unspecified contracts 
with unnamed other entities to achieve unidentified anticompetitive effects does not meet the minimum standards for pleading a 
conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."")."
1256,18," While the Supreme Court indicated that ""a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires 
more than labels and conclusions,"" for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met this burden. Bell Atl. 
Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1959."
1256,19," See also In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., No. 04-5184, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, 2007 WL 1100449, at *8 (D.N.J. April 
5, 2007) (utilizing heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) where the plaintiffs' antitrust conspiracy 
claims  [*39] were predicated on fraud)."
1256,20," Defendant reasserts this argument repeatedly throughout its papers. For purposes of efficiency, the Court will not revisit this 
issue herein. "
1257,21," In Bell Atl. Corp., the plaintiffs alleged that the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ""have entered into a contract, combination 
or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective local telephone and/or high speed internet services markets and 
have agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another."" Id. at 1963."
1257,22," The Court recognizes that ""[t]he allegation of unspecified  [*43] contracts with unnamed other entities to achieve unidentified 
anticompetitive effects does not meet the minimum standards for pleading a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."" 
Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding Inc., 824 F.2d 223, 230-31 (3d Cir. 1987). Nevertheless, the Court does not find that the 
deficiencies alleged by Defendant in this case rise to the level of those contemplated by the Third Circuit in Garshman, where 
the complaint, itself, failed to allege any ""adverse effect on competition in any relevant market."" Id. at 231. "
1258,23," See, e.g., Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1960, 1964 (HN23[
] ""A complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,"" only ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."")."
1258,24," See generally Harrison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar Intern., Inc., 423 F.3d 374, 385 (3d Cir. 2005)  [*45] (""Here, Harrison Aire is a 
consumer of balloon fabric, and it claims antitrust injury in the form of business losses caused by high fabric prices, which in turn 
allegedly were caused by Raven/Aerostar's exclusionary conduct in the relevant fabric market. This type of injury-HN24[
] 
prohibitively high consumer prices resulting from allegedly monopolistic behavior-is the type the antitrust laws are designed to 
redress.""). "
1259,25," Because Defendant does not argue that Plaintiffs' alleged injuries are not ""inextricably intertwined"" with Defendant's alleged 
actions in the relevant markets, the Court need not consider same."
1259,26," Defendant also makes the related argument that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing generally because they ""have not alleged the 
facts that would give them standing to complain -- e.g., that they actually buy conventional IV catheters,  [*48] that the conduct 
alleged actually affected the price of conventional IV catheters, or that plaintiffs actually were injured by that conduct."" (Def. Br. 
at 17, 20) (emphasis in original). To the extent that the Court should construe such an argument as based on the theory that 
Plaintiffs cannot suffer antitrust injury in a relevant market in which it is not a participant, such an argument is, therefore, 
rejected."
1259,27," To the extent that Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing generally based on the theory that Plaintiffs have not 
alleged that they are direct purchasers of the Disposable  [*49] Hypodermic Products at issue, the Court will, therefore, defer its 
consideration of this argument. See Def. Br. at 17, 20 (arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing because they ""have not alleged the 
facts that would them standing to complain -- e.g., that they actually buy conventional IV catheters, that the conduct alleged 
actually affected the price of conventional IV catheters, or that plaintiffs actually were injured by that conduct."") (emphasis in 
original). "
1260,28," Furthermore, the Court has reviewed the unpublished decisions cited to by Defendant and finds that the types of deficiencies 
alleged by Defendant in this case do not rise to the level of the deficiencies found by the respective courts in those cases. See, 
e.g., McPherson's, Ltd. v. Never Dull, Inc., 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17442, 1990 WL 238812, *4 (D.N.J. 1990) (dismissing antitrust 
claims where the complaint contained merely a ""boilerplate allegation of price discrimination without providing supporting 
facts.""); JM Computer Servs. v. Schlumberger Techs., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21885, 1996 WL 241607, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 
1996) (granting defendant's motion to dismiss a § 2 claim where plaintiff (1) failed to ""identify the specific products  [*52] or 
services in product markets for which Plaintiff claims there is no price elasticity,"" (2) failed to ""identify an agreement with a 
specific person or entity,"" and (3) ""does not identify the parts, services, or contracts involved in the alleged exclusive dealing"")."
1260,29," See Silidor Decl., Ex. 4 at 23."
1260,30," See In re Methionine Antitrust Litig., 204 F.R.D. 161, 164 (N.D. Cal. 2001); A&M Supply Co. v. Microsoft Corp., 252 Mich. App. 
580, 654 N.W. 2d 572, 575 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002); Melnick v. Microsoft Corp., No. 99-709, 2001 WL 1012261, at *6 (Me. Super. 
Ct. Aug. 24, 2001). Moreover,  [*54] to the extent that Defendant cites to Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 
(1977), for the proposition that ""[a]n indirect purchaser plaintiff must prove that Becton charged monopoly prices and that all or 
some of Becton's 'overcharge' was passed through the distribution chain from the first purchaser to the indirect purchaser 
plaintiff"" (Def. Br. at 23), Defendant fails to indicate how Plaintiffs' ultimate burden of proof is relevant at this stage of the 
litigation. See, e.g., Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236 (explaining that, HN28[
] in conducting a 12(b)(6) analysis, the question is not 
whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in a trial on the merits, but whether they should be given an opportunity to offer evidence 
in support of their claims). "
1261,31," HN29[
] L. Civ. R. 7.2(b) imposes a 15 page limit for reply briefs when using a 14-point Times New Roman font, as was done in this case. Moreover, L. Civ. R. 7.2(b) specifically provides that ""[b]riefs of greater length will only be accepted if special 
permission of the Judge or Magistrate Judge is obtained prior to submission of the brief."" Defendant's reply brief totals 15 pages. 
However, Defendant's reply brief also refers the Court  [*55] to pages 8-14 of the reply brief it submitted in connection with its 
motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., 
Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., JM Smith d/b/a Smith Drug Company, Dik Drug Company, American Sales Company, Inc., 
Park Surgical Co. Inc. and SAJ Distributors, Inc. See Def. Reply Br. at 2. Not only does this put Defendant well over the allotted 
15 page limit, but such cross-referencing is both confusing and frustrating to the Court, and should therefore be avoided in all 
future filings. In any event, Defendant does not indicate that it sought, or was given, permission, to file an over-length reply brief 
in this instance. As a result, to the extent that pages 8-14 of the reply brief submitted in connection with Defendant's motion to 
dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., 
Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., JM Smith d/b/a Smith Drug Company, Dik Drug Company, American Sales Company, Inc., 
Park Surgical Co. Inc. and SAJ Distributors, Inc. raise arguments not raised herein, the Court will not consider such arguments 
in connection  [*56] with the instant motion to dismiss."
1261,32," The Court notes that the cases cited to by Defendant in support of this argument are either not binding on this Court, or were 
decided before Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999). See Def. Br. at 25."
1261,33," Magistrate Judge Ronald J. Hedges' March 28, 2007 Order indicates that motions for class certification will be forthcoming. 
See CM/ECF Docket Entry No. 146."
1261,34," The Court is unpersuaded by Defendant's contention that the Ortiz ""logically antecedent"" exception does not apply to the 
circumstances at hand. 527 U.S. 815, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999). (Def. Reply Br. at 3). As previously indicated, 
the state antitrust claims alleged in Count IV of the Complaint are brought ""only by the Indirect Class."" See Compl. at 24 
(emphasis added). Should the Court decide not  [*59] to certify the Indirect Class, then Defendant's concerns regarding claims 
""brought only by the Indirect Class"" may be moot. Id. "
1262,35," See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d at 542 (declining to address similar arguments regarding the deficiency 
of plaintiffs' state antitrust claims, and explaining that it would be ""inefficient to determine under which state laws the Indirect 
Purchasers have viable claims before first deciding the class certification and choice of law issues.""). "
1271,1," For purposes of the instant motion, Plaintiffs include Medstar Health, Inc., Medstar-Georgetown Medical Center, Inc., 
Washington Hospital Center Corporation and National Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc. (hereinafter collectively ""Plaintiffs"")."
1271,2," The operative complaint is the Class Action Amended Complaint filed on July 28, 2006, hereinafter referred to as ""Complaint."" 
In the instant Opinion, the Court addresses only Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint filed by Medstar Health, Inc., 
Medstar-Georgetown Medical Center, Inc., Washington Hospital Center Corporation and National Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc. 
Defendant has  [*4] filed separate motions to dismiss the complaints of other parties to this multidistrict litigation, which have 
been decided by the Court by way of separate opinions. "
1272,3," The Court decides this matter without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78. Jurisdiction is premised on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1337."
1272,4," For purposes of the instant motion to dismiss, the Court accepts Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true, and relies only on the 
Complaint. See, e.g., Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 222 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (HN1[
] ""In deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally consider only the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, 
matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim.""). Defendant attaches certain documents to its motion to 
dismiss, including a copy of the Supplier Agreement between Becton Dickinson & Company and Novation, L.L.C., dated October 
12, 1999, and urges the Court to consider same on the basis that said documents are ""integral"" to the Complaint. (Def. Br. at 9, 
n. 4; Silodor Decl., Ex. 2). While Plaintiffs do not appear to oppose the Court's consideration of such documents (Pl. Opp'n Br. at 
17-18), the  [*5] Court determines that it is unnecessary to consider same for purposes of the instant motion to dismiss."
1272,5," Defendant has also moved to dismiss (1) the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Louisiana 
Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., JM Smith d/b/a Smith Drug Company, Dik Drug Company, 
American Sales Company, Inc., Park Surgical Co. Inc. and SAJ Distributors, Inc., and (2) the Consolidated Class Action 
Complaint filed by Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. As previously indicated, the foregoing motions will not be 
addressed herein. "
1275,6," In doing so, a court may look only to the facts alleged in the complaint and any accompanying attachments, and may not look 
at the record. See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994). "
1276,7," In so holding, the United States Supreme Court rejected the language previously used by the Court in Conley v. Gibson, 
providing that ""[i]n appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not 
be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of 
his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). See Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. 
at 1964, 1974 (holding that the Conley ""no set of facts"" language ""has earned its retirement"" and ""is best forgotten."")."
1276,8," See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d 517 (D.N.J. 2004); In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litig., 157 F.Supp.2d 
355, 359 (D.N.J. 2001)."
1276,9," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) provides  [*21] that HN5[
] ""[a] pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall 
contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."""
1276,10," See also Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n. 17, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 
(1983) (stating that HN6[
] ""a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a 
potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.""). "
1277,11," In doing so, the Court is cognizant of the fact that HN8[
] ""a formulaic recitation of a cause of action's elements"" alone will 
not sustain Plaintiffs' obligation to provide the grounds of their entitlement to relief. Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1959. "
1278,12," Given the foregoing allegations, the Court finds ""plausible grounds to infer an agreement"" between Defendant and certain 
GPOs and/or manufactures. Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1965. See generally Elder--Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dep't 
Stores, Inc., 459 F.2d 138, 146 (6th Cir. 1972) (HN14[
] ""The granting of exclusive selling rights or acceptance of such 
exclusive selling rights, acts which are not prohibited by law unless there is a resulting foreclosure of market alternatives cannot, 
without proof of such foreclosure, form the basis for a jury verdict that the defendants had entered into a conspiracy to restrain 
trade.""). "
1279,13," See, e.g., SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056, 1065 (3d Cir. 1978) (finding that ""the act of willful acquisition and 
maintenance of monopoly power was brought about by linking products on which  [*30] Lilly faced no competition Keflin and 
Keflex with a competitive product, Kefzol. The result was to sell all three products on a non-competitive basis in what would have 
otherwise been a competitive market for Ancef and Kefzol. The effect of the Revised CSP was to force SmithKline to pay 
rebates on one product, Ancef, equal to rebates paid by Lilly based on volume sales of three products."")."
1279,14," See generally Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc., 113 F.3d at 415 (""Thus, SER must allege that PP & L unlawfully acquired 
 [*32] monopoly power or had a dangerous probability of unlawfully achieving monopoly power in its service area. To do this, 
SER must allege that PP & L in some way acted to exclude SER as a competitor in the delivery of electricity to customers in PP 
& L's service area.""). "
1280,15," In particular, Defendant argues that ""as a matter of law, safety and conventional devices are not interchangeable and cannot 
be part of the same relevant market."" Even if Defendant is ultimately correct, the Court declines to engage in any such analysis 
at this time. See, e.g., Ansell, Inc. v. Schmid Labs, Inc., 757 F. Supp. 467 (D.N.J. 1991) (defining relevant product market after 
multi-day hearing, including expert testimony)."
1280,16," Moreover, Defendant's reliance on E. & G. Gabriel v. Gabriel Bros., Inc., -- a case which is not binding on this Court and 
distinguishable on a number  [*35] of levels -- is misplaced. No. 93-0894, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9455, 1994 WL 369147, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. July 13, 1994) (finding plaintiff's proposed market, comprised of ""products as varied as household hardwares and 
children's sleepwear,"" to be implausible, and reasoning that ""[h]ammers are obviously not reasonable substitutes for children's 
pajamas, they are not used for similar purposes, nor will the price of hammers affect the price of pajamas.""). "
1281,17," Throughout its papers, Defendant relies on a number of cases, which are not binding on this Court, for the proposition that 
Plaintiffs' have failed to plead with the requisite ""particularity"" or ""specificity."" The Court has reviewed these decisions and finds 
that such cases do not warrant dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims on such a basis at this time. See, e.g., Broadcom Corp. v. 
Qualcomm Inc., No. 05-3350, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62090, 2006 WL 2528545, at *7-9 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2006)  [*38] (dismissing 
antitrust claims where defendant had a ""legal monopoly over the technology claimed in its patents,"" and expressing concern 
""that reviewing and supervising the terms upon which Qualcomm licenses its patents, and offers to sell its UMTS chipsets may 
be beyond the effective control of the Court under the antitrust laws.""); Glaberson v. Comcast Corp., No. 03-6604, 2006 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 62672, 2006 WL 2559479, at *15 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2006) (denying motion to dismiss and finding that ""Comcast has 
not demonstrated that Plaintiffs cannot prove any set of facts, consistent with the Third Amended Complaint, which would entitle 
them to relief.""); JM Computer Servs. v. Schlumberger Techs., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21885, 1996 WL 241607, at *4 (N.D. Cal. 
May 3, 1996) (granting defendant's motion to dismiss a § 2 claim where plaintiff (1) failed to ""identify the specific products or 
services in product markets for which Plaintiff claims there is no price elasticity,"" (2) failed to ""identify an agreement with a 
specific person or entity,"" and (3) ""does not identify the parts, services, or contracts involved in the alleged exclusive dealing""). Defendant also relies heavily on the Third Circuit's decision in Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding Inc., 824 F.2d 223, 230-31 
(3d Cir. 1987).  [*39] The Court has reviewed the Garshman decision and finds that the deficiencies alleged by Defendant in this 
case do not rise to the level of those contemplated by the Third Circuit in Garshman, where the complaint, itself, failed to allege 
any ""adverse effect on competition in any relevant market."" Id. at 230-31 (stating that ""[t]he allegation of unspecified contracts 
with unnamed other entities to achieve unidentified anticompetitive effects does not meet the minimum standards for pleading a 
conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."")."
1281,18," While the Supreme Court indicated that ""a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires 
more than labels and conclusions,"" for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met this burden. Bell Atl. 
Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1959. "
1282,19," See also In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., No. 04-5184, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25632, 2007 WL 1100449, at *8 (D.N.J. April 
5, 2007) (utilizing heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) where the plaintiffs' antitrust conspiracy 
claims were predicated on fraud)."
1282,20," Defendant reasserts this argument repeatedly throughout its papers. For purposes of efficiency, the Court  [*40] will not revisit 
this issue herein."
1282,21," In Bell Atl. Corp., the plaintiffs alleged that the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ""have entered into a contract, combination 
or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective local telephone and/or high speed internet services markets and 
have agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another."" Id. at 1963. "
1283,22," The Court recognizes that ""[t]he allegation of unspecified contracts with unnamed other entities to achieve unidentified 
anticompetitive effects does not meet the minimum standards  [*44] for pleading a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."" 
Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding Inc., 824 F.2d 223, 230-31 (3d Cir. 1987). Nevertheless, the Court does not find that the 
deficiencies alleged by Defendant in this case rise to the level of those contemplated by the Third Circuit in Garshman, where 
the complaint, itself, failed to allege any ""adverse effect on competition in any relevant market."" Id. at 231."
1283,23," See generally Harrison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar Intern., Inc., 423 F.3d 374, 385 (3d Cir. 2005) (""Here, Harrison Aire is a consumer 
of balloon fabric, and it claims antitrust injury in the form of business losses caused by high fabric prices, which in turn allegedly 
were caused by Raven/Aerostar's exclusionary conduct in the relevant fabric market. This type of injury-HN23[
] prohibitively 
high consumer prices resulting from allegedly monopolistic behavior-is the type  [*46] the antitrust laws are designed to 
redress.""). "
1284,24," Because Defendant does not argue that Plaintiffs' alleged injuries are not ""inextricably intertwined"" with Defendant's alleged 
actions in the relevant markets, the Court need not consider same."
1284,25," Defendant also makes the related argument that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing generally because they have ""not alleged the 
facts that would give it standing to complain -- e.g., that it actually buys those products from Becton, that it did so pursuant to an 
'exclusive' contract, that the contract prevented MedStar from buying such products from Becton's rivals, and that such conduct 
actually affected the price of such products."" (Def. Br. at 27) (emphasis in original). To the extent that the Court should construe 
such an argument as based on the theory that Plaintiffs cannot suffer antitrust injury  [*49] in a relevant market in which it is not 
a participant, such an argument is, therefore, rejected."
1284,26," To the extent that Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing generally based on the theory that Plaintiffs have not 
alleged that they are direct purchasers of the Disposable Hypodermic Products at issue, the Court will, therefore, defer its 
consideration of this argument. See Def. Br. at 27  [*50] (arguing that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing because Plaintiffs have 
""not alleged the facts that would give it standing to complain -- e.g., that it actually buys those products from Becton, that it did so 
pursuant to an 'exclusive' contract, that the contract prevented MedStar from buying such products from Becton's rivals, and that 
such conduct actually affected the price of such products."") (emphasis in original). "
1285,27," Furthermore, Defendant cites to no legal authority indicating that such allegations have been insufficiently plead. In fact, the 
majority of the cases relied upon by Defendant in this regard are either not binding on this Court, or were not decided at the 
motion to dismiss level, therefore providing little or no guidance to the Court as to whether Plaintiffs' exclusive dealing allegations 
were properly or improperly pled. See, e.g., Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 
2d 333 (1990); Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961); LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 
324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003)."
1285,28," Defendant incorporates by reference its arguments at pages 22-23 and 36-38 of its Memorandum in Support of its Motion to 
Dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's Pharmacy and Drug Mart Tallman, attached as Exhibit 4 to the Silodor 
Declaration. See Silodor Decl., Ex. 4 at 22-23."
1285,29," See Silidor Decl., Ex. 4 at 23. "
1286,30," See In re Methionine Antitrust Litig., 204 F.R.D. 161, 164 (N.D. Cal. 2001); A&M Supply Co. v. Microsoft Corp., 252 Mich. App. 
580, 654 N.W. 2d 572, 575 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002); Melnick v. Microsoft Corp., No. 99-709, 2001 WL 1012261, at *6 (Me. Super. 
Ct. Aug. 24, 2001). Moreover, to the extent that Defendant cites to Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), 
 [*55] for the proposition that ""[a]n indirect purchaser plaintiff must prove that Becton charged monopoly prices and that all or 
some of Becton's 'overcharge' was passed through the distribution chain from the first purchaser to the indirect purchaser 
plaintiff,"" (Silidor Decl., Ex. 4 at 23) Defendant fails to indicate how Plaintiffs' ultimate burden of proof is relevant at this stage of 
the litigation. See, e.g., Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236 (explaining that, HN27[
] in conducting a 12(b)(6) analysis, the question is 
not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in a trial on the merits, but whether they should be given an opportunity to offer 
evidence in support of their claims)."
1286,31," Defendant's brief incorporates by reference pages 36-38 of its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's 
Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. attached as Exhibit 4 to the Silodor Declaration. See Silodor Decl., Ex. 4 at 36-38."
1286,32," In Section V of its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc., 
Defendant makes the argument that certain state law claims should be dismissed because the named plaintiffs lack standing to 
bring claims in those states in which the named plaintiffs do not engage in business. See Silodor Decl., Ex. 4 at 24. The Court 
notes that this argument is not raised in connection with the instant motion to dismiss, nor is it expressly incorporated by 
reference. See Def. Br. at 30. However, page 38 of the motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. 
and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. -- which Defendant does incorporate by reference -- then refers the Court to Section V of same. See "
1287,," Silodor  [*59] Decl., Ex. 4 at 38, 24. Defendant's maneuvering in this regard is both confusing and frustrating to the Court, and 
should be avoided in all future filings. Moreover, as a result of such maneuvering, it is unclear to the Court whether Defendant 
intends to incorporate this argument into its motion to dismiss the instant Complaint. HN30[
] L. Civ. R. 7.2(b) imposes a 40 page limit when using a 14-point Times New Roman font, as was done in this case. Moreover, L. Civ. R. 7.2(b) specifically provides that ""[b]riefs of greater length will only be accepted if special permission of the 
Judge or Magistrate Judge is obtained prior to submission of the brief."" Defendant's brief totals 30 pages. Defendant also 
incorporates by reference pages 22-23, 36-38, and 27-36 of its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's 
Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. See Def. Br. at 30. This puts Defendant's brief at 5 pages over the 40 page limit. 
While the Court has considered the arguments contained therein, as a courtesy to Defendant, to the extent that Defendant also 
seeks to indirectly incorporate by reference the arguments raised in Section V of its motion to dismiss the Consolidated 
Complaint  [*60] of Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc., the arguments contained therein will not be considered 
by the Court. Defendant does not indicate that it sought, or was given, permission, to file an over-length brief in this instance. Even if the Court were to consider same, the Court would decline to entertain such an argument prior to addressing the issue of 
class certification. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 816, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999) (HN31[
] ""[w]hile an Article III court ordinarily must be sure of its own jurisdiction before getting to the merits, a Rule 23 question should be 
treated first because class certification issues are 'logically antecedent' to Article III concerns . . . ."") (citation omitted). The state 
antitrust claims alleged in Count IV of the Complaint are brought ""only by the Indirect Class."" See Compl. at 25. (emphasis 
added). Should the Court decide not to certify the Indirect Class, then Defendant's concerns regarding claims ""brought only by 
the Indirect Class"" may be moot. See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d at 544 (declining to address defendant's 
argument that plaintiffs lack Article III standing to assert claims in jurisdictions in which plaintiffs  [*61] do not allege to have been 
purchasers prior to determining class certification); Clark v. McDonald's Corp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 205 (2003) (declining to address 
defendant's argument that plaintiff has no standing to assert claims on behalf of class members regarding restaurants in states 
that plaintiff, himself, has not visited, and reasoning that such an issue ""would not arise but for Clark's capacity as a putative 
class representative.""); In re Buspirone Patent Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 363, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (deferring on issue of Article III 
standing on a motion to dismiss, and explaining that ""it is appropriate to decide class certification before resolving alleged Article 
III challenges of the present kind."")."
1287,33," Defendant's brief incorporates by reference pages 27-36 of its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint of Jabo's 
Pharmacy, Inc. and Drug Mart Tallman, Inc. attached as Exhibit 4 to the Silodor Declaration. See Silodor Decl., Ex. 4 at 27-36."
1287,34," See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d at 542 (declining to address similar arguments regarding the deficiency 
of plaintiffs' state antitrust claims, and explaining that it would be ""inefficient to determine under which state laws the Indirect 
Purchasers have viable claims before first deciding the class certification and choice of law issues.""). "
1290,1," Following the merger, Allied Waste Service continued to use the corporate name BFI in the southeastern Massachusetts 
hauling market. "
1293,2," According to the plaintiff's expert, some sources estimate the market shares of WMMA and BFI in the waste hauling market as 
20-25% and 45-50%, respectively."
1293,3," Plaintiff's argument that BFI and SEMass should be treated as a single entity prior to the 1999 divestiture, citing Nobody in 
Particular Presents, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'n, 311 F. Supp. 2d 1048 (D. Colo. 2004), is unavailing. "
1299,1, Some minor revenue from sales from local team pro shops may adhere to the benefit of the local team.
1299,2," Plaintiff also contends that Reebok, also a defendant and supposedly an ardent suitor, itself creates the plurality necessary for 
Section 1 claims. But if NFL Properties HN3[
] can issue an exclusive license, then whether or not the licensee urged, solicited 
or vigorously argued for the change is irrelevant. "
1308,1," In citing to additional documents throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court will refer to the docket item numbers used in 
Civil Action No. 05-485-JJF. "
1309,2," Intel filed a Supplemental Brief addressing the Twombly decision. Class Plaintiffs have also filed a response. The Second 
Circuit recently identified and discussed the ""conflicting signals"" from Twombly in determining how that decision impacts the 
standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss. Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 13911, 2007 WL 1717803, *8-
*11 (2d Cir. June 14, 2007). While the Second Circuit acknowledged that Twombly dealt with antitrust claims under Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act, the Second Circuit also acknowledged that the Supreme Court likely intended some change in the dismissal 
standard extending beyond antitrust conspiracy cases. The Court understands Twombly to primarily be a decision aimed at bringing the standard of dismissal back to its ""roots"" by 
undoing the literal reading of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), engaged in  [**6] by some 
courts and emphasizing that Conley ""described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the 
minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint's survival."" 127 S. Ct. at 1969. For purposes of Intel's motion 
here, the Court will apply, where applicable, what the Second Circuit has coined the ""flexible plausibility standard"" of Twombly to 
Class Plaintiffs' claims as outlined by the Court in its recitation of the standard of review governing Intel's Motion. "
1311,3," Class Plaintiffs agree with Intel that this element of AGC applies to both their federal and state claims; however, Class Plaintiffs 
contend that the antitrust injury under Section 16 is less demanding than Section 4 and broader for their state law claims. "
1312,4," Defendants have included the State of New York in their argument as the fifth state at issue. However, Plaintiffs' claims under 
New York law fail for reasons apart from the intrastate pleading requirement, and therefore, the Court will not discuss New York 
law here. See infra Section I.D. of the Discussion portion of this Memorandum Opinion. "
1314,5," Intel argues that no part of Intel's conduct can be considered ""wholly intrastate"" in character, because Intel is a component 
maker and Class Plaintiffs are indirect purchasers of downstream products who are several links down the manufacturing and 
distribution chain from Intel's alleged conduct. However, the component part argument does not appear to be relevant to the 
Mississippi Supreme Court's approach to when sales and distributions within the state assume an intrastate character. Standard 
Oil, 65 So. at 471. "
1315,6," CPLR § 901(b) provides: HN16[
] Unless a statute creating or imposing a penalty, or a minimum measure of recovery specifically authorizes the 
recovery thereof in a class action, an action to recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by 
statute may not be maintained as a class action."
1315,7," Further, HN18[
] a majority of courts have concluded that § 901 is a substantive rule and not a procedural rule. Therefore, under Erie principles, § 901 applies in federal court diversity actions. See Holster v. Gatco, Inc., 485 F. Supp. 2d 179, 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 20953, 2007 WL 923086, *4-6 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). For additional discussion of Erie principles in the context of Class 
Plaintiffs' class action consumer protection claims see infra Section II of the Discussion portion of this Memorandum Opinion. "
1327,1," Meyers v. Bayer AG, 2006 WI App 102, 293 Wis. 2d 770, 718 N.W.2d 251."
1327,2," Except where otherwise noted, the complaint we refer to throughout this opinion is the second amended complaint filed by the 
plaintiffs in this action."
1327,3, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2005-06 version unless otherwise indicated. 
1328,4," At oral argument, the issue arose of whether the agreement between Bayer and the generic manufacturers constituted 
actionable conduct under Chapter 133. We note that a federal district court dismissed an action under the Sherman Antitrust Act 
against Bayer on grounds that the Agreement between Bayer and the generic manufacturers did not violate federal antitrust 
law. See In re Ciproflaxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litigation, 363 F. Supp. 2d 514 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). In a complex opinion 
discussing a number of different issues, the federal district court addressed whether the consumer plaintiffs could attack the 
validity of the Cipro patent post hoc, and the effect of the possible invalidity of the patent on the legality of the Agreements, 
among other questions. Because these issues have not been briefed by the parties, have not been developed in the record in 
this motion to dismiss, and are not properly before this court, we do not address them further. These matters may be addressed 
by the circuit court on remand."
1328,5," Meyers' complaint indicates that, as of January 2002, Cipro was the best-selling antibiotic in the world, a position it had 
maintained for eight consecutive years. Meyers cites a March 2000 Bayer press release indicating that in 1999 Cipro posted $ 1 
billion in sales in the United States. "
1329,6," The complaint states that Rugby was a subsidiary of HMR until February 1998, at which time Rugby was acquired by Watson. 
The complaint states that Rugby retained the exclusive right to distribute generic Cipro following the sale of Rugby to Watson 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Watson"")."
1329,7," Meyers' brief states that Bayer has chosen to make quarterly payments to Barr and HMR. It states that, including the $ 49.1 
 [****11] million initial payment, Bayer agreed to pay Barr and HMR through December 2003 a total of $ 398 million not to 
compete in the United States with Bayer in the market for Cipro and generic equivalents to Cipro."
1329,8," Plaintiffs Stucker, Berg and Browning were later added to the complaint by amendment. "
1332,9," The conclusion in Olstad v. Microsoft Corp., 2005 WI 121, P28, 284 Wis. 2d 224, 700 N.W.2d 139, that the statute was 
ambiguous was not based on a reading of the text of the statute itself, but on the inconsistency in prior case law construing the 
statute. In determining the statute to be ambiguous, Olstad observed that while ""[t]he language [of Wis. Stat. § 133.03] itself 
provides no express limit to the statute's scope,"" this court had ascribed such a limit to the statute only two years earlier in 
Conley Publishing Group, Ltd. v. Journal Communications, Inc., 2003 WI 119, P16, 265 Wis. 2d 128, 665 N.W.2d 879. "
1333,10," The term ""impacts"" was not defined or described in detail by the court in Olstad. See 2005 WI 121, P85, 284 Wis. 2d 224, 700 
N.W.2d 139. The Olstad decision cites as its authority for the use of this term the ""substantially affects"" standard discussed in 
State v. Allied Chemical and Dye Corp., 9 Wis. 2d 290, 295, 101 N.W.2d 133 (1960). We  [****25] construe this language in 
Olstad (that the Wisconsin Antitrust Act applies if the ""conduct complained of 'substantially affects' the people of Wisconsin and 
has impacts in this state, even if the illegal activity resulting in those impacts occurred predominantly or exclusively outside this 
state"") as merely providing further clarification of the ""substantially affects"" test discussed in Allied Chemical, as opposed to 
altering that test. "
1334,11," The Emergency One court considered two alternate tests for determining whether state antitrust law applies in cases 
involving interstate commerce: (1) A ""contacts-based"" standard that emphasizes ""the nature and degree of defendant's contacts 
with Wisconsin"" bearing similarities to the International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 
(1945), test in the law of personal jurisdiction, and the ""aggregation of contacts""  [****30] standard set forth in Allstate Ins. Co. v. 
Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 308, 101 S. Ct. 633, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1981), to resolve ""choice of law"" disputes; and (2) A 
""predominance"" standard, which would apply state antitrust law only to transactions and commerce that is predominantly 
intrastate in nature. Emergency One v. Waterous Co., Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 959, 967-969 (E.D. Wis. 1998). The federal district 
court rejected the ""contacts-based"" standard because, in cases involving nationwide sales, application of a ""contacts-based"" 
standard might result in application of state antitrust law when no significant injury to trade and economic competition occurred 
in the state. The court rejected the ""predominance"" standard on grounds that it would essentially reintroduce federal preemption 
of state anti-trust law (commerce cannot be both predominantly interstate and predominantly intrastate in nature) ""a result 
consistently rejected by the Supreme Court."" See Emergency One, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 967 (citing California v. ARC America 
Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 102, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989)). "
1337,12," Because Szukalski v. Crompton Corp., 2006 WI App 195, 296 Wis. 2d 728, 726 N.W.2d 304, no petition for review filed, is not 
before us, and we have not had an opportunity to review the plaintiff's complaint in Szukalski to determine its sufficiency, we do 
not address the Szukalski court's conclusion that the plaintiff failed to allege substantial Wisconsin effects."
1337,13," As to the merits of these policy arguments, we note that Bayer and amici fail to provide empirical support for the proposition 
that failure to limit the applicability of the Wisconsin Antitrust Act would harm Wisconsin's business climate. "
1338,14," The complaint in Emergency One, 23 F. Supp. 2d 959, alleged only that 3500 to 4000 fire trucks are purchased by fire 
departments in the United States annually."
1338,15," As we previously indicated, supra, P4 n.4, issues regarding the validity or invalidity of the Cipro patent, and the effect of the 
possible invalidity of the patent on the legality of the Agreements have not been briefed by the parties, have not been developed 
in the record in this motion to dismiss, and are not properly before this court. These matters may be addressed by the circuit 
court on remand. "

1340,17," The Bayer-Barr agreement, about which the plaintiffs complain, is not in the record before us."
1340,18," The facts used in the background narration have been taken from the complaint and from the public records of the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). We may take judicial 
notice of public records of governmental agencies. Perkins v. State, 61 Wis. 2d 341, 346, 212 N.W.2d 141 (1973). "

1343,23," 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) provides, ""The districts courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of 
Congress relating to patents . . . . Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states."""
1343,24," [D]istrict courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over actions ""arising under"" federal patent laws, i.e., in an action challenging 
the validity or enforceability of the patent. Schecher v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 317 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1257 (D. Kan. 2004)."
1343,25," Village of Trempealeau v. Mikrut, 2004 WI 79, 273 Wis. 2d 76, 681 N.W.2d 190, explains that as a general proposition, circuit 
courts have broad subject matter jurisdiction; however, ""[f]ederal law may confer exclusive jurisdiction over certain subject 
matters to the federal courts, precluding state court jurisdiction in those areas by operation of the Supremacy Clause."" Id., P8 
n.2. "
1344,26," The freedom to take actions within the rights granted to a patent owner that would otherwise be unlawful has a limitation. If the 
patent was obtained ""by knowing and willful fraud practiced by the defendant on the Patent Office or, if the defendant was not 
the original patent applicant, [but] he had been enforcing the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent manner in which it was 
obtained,"" the patent will provide no shield to claims of unlawful anticompetitive conduct. Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food 
Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 179, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring). "
1345,27," The plaintiffs in the case before us are all ""indirect purchasers"" of Cipro because they did not purchase Cipro directly from 
Bayer or Barr. Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 726, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (Ill. 1977). "
1346,28," This date predates FDA final approval to Barr, which according to the FDA's public records occurred on June 9, 2004."
1346,29," For example, while one who owns a patent can price-fix for the patented invention to those to whom it or its licensees sell, it 
cannot lawfully fix the price for the patented invention that will be charged by those to whom the patent owner or its licensees "
1347,," have sold. General Elec., 272 U.S. at 485. In addition, a licensee who has rights under a former provision in the Hatch-Waxman 
Act to act as the first generic producer for 180 days on the expiration of the patent (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)) cannot lawfully 
agree to delay the commencement of the 180-day period and in so doing, extend the patent beyond the term granted by the 
PTO. In re Cardizem CK Antitrust Litig., 332 F.3d 896, 907-08 (6th Cir. 2003)."
1347,30," That the plaintiffs' claim is made against the patent owner for Cipro was argued to the circuit court. It was not briefed for us 
because the circuit court dismissed the complaint on other grounds and the court of appeals reviewed only the grounds 
employed by the circuit court. However, many questions about the effect of Bayer's Cipro patent on the plaintiffs' claims were 
asked of counsel for all parties at the oral argument before us. "
1358,1," Dr. Donald Austrian specializes in internal medicine and is affiliated with Bridgeport Hospital; Dr. Francis Garofalo is a urologist 
who, at the time the complaint was initiated in 2005, was affiliated with Norwalk Hospital, but has since moved out-of-state; Dr. 
Kenneth Miller is a rheumatologist affiliated with Danbury, New Milford and Putnam Hospitals; and Dr. Evangelos Xistris  [*4] is a 
neurologist affiliated with Stamford Hospital."
1358,2," Practice Book § 10-29(a) HN1[
] permits the plaintiff to make any document a part of the complaint as fully as if it had been 
set out at length, and the court can consider such document(s) as part of the complaint on a motion to strike. Tracy v. New 
Milford Public Schools, 101 Conn.App. 560, 566, 922 A.2d 280 (2007)."
1358,3," The  [*5] exact corporate relationships of the defendants are actually more involved. According to the complaint, the defendant 
UHC is a subsidiary of UHIC Holdings, Inc. UHIC Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of United HealthCare Services, Inc., which in turn 
is a subsidiary of the defendant UHG. The defendant Oxford Health Plans (CT), Inc., is a subsidiary of Oxford Health Plans, LLC, which in turn is a subsidiary of the 
defendant UHG. The defendant Oxford Health Insurance, Inc., is a subsidiary of Oxford Health Plans (NY), Inc., which in turn is 
a subsidiary of Oxford Health Plans, LLC. As previously stated, Oxford Health Plans, LLC is a subsidiary of the defendant UHG."
1358,4," The complaint alleges the following about the ""all products"" clause: ""Requiring physicians to accept inferior plans imposing 
inadequate reimbursement rates, unreasonable risk, limited coverage, burdensome administrative requirements, limited drug 
formularies and other inappropriate incentives forces those physicians into a situation where they cannot opt-out of the plans for 
financial reasons, and places them in a position where they cannot provide a reasonable level of care due to the restrictions of 
the inferior plan. Moreover, when the physician's agreement with one plan is cancelled solely due to his or her refusal to 
participate in other plans, that physician incurs a great financial burden and is prevented from continuing to furnish medical care 
to his or her current patients, who are thus deprived of access to and continuity of medical care."" Complaint P26. "
1359,5, The language of the complaint makes it unclear whether Austrian's contract with UHC continued or was actually terminated.
1359,6, A copy of a letter such as described here is attached to the complaint at Exhibit E. 
1362,7," See generally, Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., supra, 467 U.S. 772-73: ""HN8[
] Antitrust liability should not 
depend on whether a corporate subunit is organized as an unincorporated division or a wholly owned subsidiary. A corporation 
has complete power to maintain a wholly owned subsidiary in either form. The economic, legal, or other considerations that lead 
corporate management to choose one structure over the other are not relevant to whether the enterprise's conduct seriously 
threatens competition. Rather, a corporation may adopt the subsidiary form of organization for valid management and related 
purposes. Separate incorporation may improve management, avoid special tax problems arising from multi-state operations, or "
1363,," serve other legitimate interests. Especially in view of the increasing complexity of corporate operations, a business enterprise 
should be free to structure itself in ways that serve efficiency of control,  [*23] economy of operations, and other factors dictated 
by business judgment without increasing its exposure to antitrust liability."""
1363,8," See also, Chicago Prof. Sports v. Natl. Basketball Asso., 95 F.3d 593, 598 (7th Cir. 1996): ""Copperweld does not hold that only 
conflict-free enterprises may be treated as single entities. Instead it asks why the antitrust laws distinguish between unilateral 
and concerted action, and then assigns a parent-subsidiary group to the 'unilateral' side in light of those functions. Like a single 
firm, the parent-subsidiary combination cooperates internally to increase efficiency. Conduct that 'deprives the marketplace of 
the independent centers of decision making that competition assumes' … without the efficiencies that come with integration 
inside a firm, go on the 'concerted' side of the line."" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)"
1363,9," In regard to § 1 of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court in Copperweld expressed the following on this issue: ""Although we 
recognize that any ""gap"" the Sherman Act leaves [in the antitrust regulation of concerted activity] is the sensible result of a 
purposeful policy decision by Congress, we also note that the size of any such gap is open to serious question. HN10[
] Any 
anti-competitive activities of corporations and their wholly owned subsidiaries meriting antitrust remedies may be policed 
adequately without resort to an intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine. A corporation's initial acquisition of control will always be 
subject to scrutiny under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18. Thereafter, the enterprise is fully "
1364,," subject to § 2 of the Sherman Act and § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission  [*27] act, 15 U.S.C. § 45."" Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., supra, 467 U.S. 776-77."
1364,10," General Statutes § 35-27 HN11[
] is patterned after § 2 of the Sherman Act. Shea v. First Fed. Savings & Loan of New Haven, 184 Conn. 285, 304, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). The settled law is that ""[t]he conduct of a single firm is governed by § 2 [of the 
Sherman Act] alone and is unlawful only when it threatens actual monopolization."" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube 
Corp., supra, 467 U.S. 767. The plaintiffs have not made any claims under General Statutes § 35-27."
1364,11," ""Tying is a form of marketing in which a seller insists on selling two distinct products or services as a package. A supermarket 
that will sell flour to consumers only if they will also buy sugar is engaged in tying. Flour is referred to as the tying product, sugar 
as the tied product."" Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 33, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). As the 
Supreme Court has explained, however, ""there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about packaged sales."" Id. at 25. ""Only

284 (1980). "
1369,14," Exhibit A to the complaint under the heading ""How long our agreement lasts; how it gets amended; and how it can end,"" states 
the following in pertinent part: Upon our execution of  [*48] this agreement, you will receive a copy from us with the effective date noted on the signature 
page. It continues until one of us terminates it. We can amend this agreement or any of the appendices on 90 days' written or electronic notice by sending you a copy of 
the amendment. Your signature is not required to make the amendment effective. However, if you do not wish to continue 
your participation with our network as changed by an amendment that is not required by law or regulation but that includes 
a material adverse change to this agreement, then you may terminate this agreement on 60 days' written or electronic 
notice to us so long as you send this termination notice within 30 days of your receipt of the amendment."
1369,15," The court also notes the inaccuracy of the plaintiffs' unqualified statement that only the physicians had the right to terminate 
the contracts. The terms of the contracts indicate that either party has the right to terminate the agreements upon ninety days 
prior written notice to the other. See Complaint, Ex. A, p. 4 (""[u]pon our execution of this agreement … [i]t continues until one of 
us terminates it … In addition, either you or we can terminate this agreement, effective on an anniversary of the date this 
agreement begins, by providing 90 days written or electronic notice.""). "
1370,16," To further support their claim that UHC breached an express provision of the provider agreements, the plaintiffs also 
emphasize that the agreements are adhesion contracts. However, HN26[
] there is no per se prohibition against adhesion 
contracts; see generally, Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Murphy, 206 Conn. 409, 416-18, 538 A.2d 219 (1988) (observing that 
insurance policies, generally, are contracts of adhesion); and the ""adhesive"" nature of a contract, without more, does not render 
a contract invalid or unenforceable. "
1374,1," The pertinent facts are fully detailed in the court's Order dated October 23, 2006. (Order, ECF No. 80.) "
1376,2," As the court noted in its Order dated October 23, 2006, the Supreme Court has held that a price discrimination claim under the

1381,5," Arteva moves for summary judgment against all of the class representatives except Thomaston Mills. Both sides move for 
summary judgment based upon their theories regarding the scope of the conspiracy. Except for the issues addressed herein, the 
Court's decision on summary judgment will be issued in a separate Order following notice to the putative class and expiration of 
the ""opt-out"" period."
1381,6," The Court begins with a description of the product and industry at the heart of the litigation. See DeLoach, 206 F.R.D. at 553 
(""The debate over class certification centers on the nature of the tobacco industry."")"
1381,7," A woven fiber is used in textile applications to manufacture sheets, apparel, home furnishings,  [*11] towels, industrial fabric. A 
nonwoven fiber is a ""fabric-like"" fiber that does not have interlocking continuous fiber strands. A nonwoven may be used to 
manufacture home furnishings, fabrics used in medical and personal care applications, and automotive and industrial fabrics. 
Knits also fall into the category of spinnable fiber. Knits are used to manufacture apparel used in sweats, tees, turtlenecks, 
jerseys and golf shirts."
1381,8," PSF of 3 denier and above (primarily in the 6 to 8 and 14 to 16 denier ranges) and measuring 1 to 5 inches in length are used 
as fiber-fill and insulating material. Fiber that is less than 3 denier is spun into yarns and then knit or woven into manufactured 
textile and apparel products. Fiber of 10 to 18 denier and 6 to 8 inches in length is generally used in the manufacture of carpets. "
1382,9," Referring to PSF categories in this manner can be misleading. According to Jeffrey Hollander, who purchases 100% of the 
polyester staple for fill, fiberfill is made by ""taking polyester staple fiber, processing it so that way it's opened up, carded out, 
combed out, to become as fluffy as possible . . . ."" (Hollander Dep. at 67.) Thus, a nonwoven PSF such as a PSF purchased for 
fill is processed or prepared for that purpose by the direct purchaser - not the PSF manufacturer. The same is true with respect 
to the other end use PSF categories."
1382,10," Arteva concedes, ""There are particular kinds of textile fibers, carpet fibers, and nonwovens[sic] fibers than[sic] can fairly be 
considered commodities.""  [*14] (Def.'s Mem. In Opp'n at 48.) Counsel for Arteva describes the ""Individually Represented 
Putative Class Members"" as ""purchasers of commodity textile PSF products."" (Egge Decl., PP5, 6) The characterization of PSF 
as a commodity is also utilized by other polyester staple manufacturers, Defendants' customers, and trade publications. (Class 
Pl.s' Exhs. 49, 52)"
1382,11," The Carpenter representative testified later that other branded programs were generally unsuccessful. (Carpenter Dep. at 87.) 
This testimony is consistent with Dr. Beyer's opinion that brand names in the PSF industry generally did not affect purchasing. 
(Beyer Aff., P32)"
1382,12," In 2000, Richard Osman, Director of Arteva's New Business Development for Fibers, testified under oath that ""Polyester fiber 
can be made from a variety of inputs with one very important qualification. These inputs are all ultimately derived from the same 
raw materials, teraphalic acid and ethylene glycol, no matter what their life history might have been . . . The end use product is 
not distinguished by the end user based on the inputs used in its production."" (See ITC March 28, 2000 Hr'g / Decision, at 18-
20.)"
1382,13," Within the nonwoven category, Fiber Dynamics uses the same raw materials and same production line to manufacture 
different nonwoven PSF products such as drylaid chemically bonded and drylaid point (or thermally) bonded PSF products. 
(Fiber Dynamics Dep. at 55-56.) One exception to the use of the same production line within the nonwoven category is fiber 
designed for an airlaid manufacturing process versus fiber designed for a wetlaid manufacturing process. (Latten Decl., PP28-
34) "
1383,14," It is not clear whether both production lines had the capability to manufacture PSF across these categories or whether 
production was  [*17] structured this way deliberately for efficiency purposes."
1383,15," Frank Hurst, Carpenter's corporate representative, explained with reference to fiberfill: ""I would look at 6 and 15 denier from all 
of these suppliers as being an almost generic product. We can bring product from any one of those suppliers, run it in our 
plants, and our customers will never tell the difference."" (Carpenter Dep. at 126-127.) (emphasis added)."
1383,16," A bicomponent staple or ""low-melt"" product is made with two different components and combines a polyester (or 
polypropylene) core (to provide strength and resilience)  [*19] surrounded by a lower melting temperature polymer (or 
polyethylene or modified co-polyester) sheath. (Rapp Decl., at 12 n. 22, 23; Kimberly Clark Dep. at 63.) When exposed to heat, 
the fiber forms a strong, cohesive bond with other fibers. Id."
1383,17," Dr. Rust disagrees with Dr. Beyer regarding cotton being a direct substitute for PSF. (Rust Trial Rpt., PP50, 58)"
1383,18," For convenience, remaining cites to ITC proceedings will be abbreviated as: ""U.S. ITC Determination, month / year, at page 
#."" "
1384,19," Arteva's contracts included the ability to increase prices or increase transportation terms as long as the customer had 30 days 
notice. (Exh. 19, P6)"
1384,20," Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Beyer, explains that, ""[i]n the absence of coordinated actions, economists would expect prices to remain 
unchanged or decline, and with an undifferentiated product and supply substitution in the PSF industry, all purchasers would 
have benefitted from unchanged or lower PSF prices."" (Beyer Trial Reply Rpt., P13)"
1384,21," There are only nine class representatives now because Doran Mills and Arteva settled Doran Mills' claim against it on 
February 9, 2007. (Document # 521)"
1384,22," Class representatives who were nonwoven fiberfill customers include: Quality Felt (manufactures mattress and furniture 
stuffing); Carpenter (mattress and furniture stuffing); Southern Fiber (mattress and furniture stuffing); and Hollander Home 
Fashions (home furnishings such as pillows, comforters).  [*24] Class representatives who were industrial nonwoven 
customers include: Habasit Belting (manufactures lightweight conveyor belts); Tex Tech, Inc. (filtration products, mattress 
products, fire-blocking material); JHNY, Inc. (automotive applications such as gaskets); and Fiber Dynamics, Inc. (filtration and 
insulation). "
1385,23," Based upon the descriptions of carpet fiber (10 to 18 denier and 6-8 inches in length) adopted by Plaintiffs' expert, Dr .Beyer, 
PSF for the manufacturing of carpets is not necessarily included within Plaintiffs' definition of polyester staple. (Compare Class 
Compl., P44 - ""generally 0.5 to 4-6 inches"" in length) with Beyer's Trial Rpt, P12). Later within Dr. Beyer's report he states that 
""[t]he class products include all the products covered by the U.S. ITC proceedings plus products both below and above the U.S. 
ITC denier range."" (Beyer's Trial Rpt, n. 18) The length of the PSF is not mentioned. According to counsel for Arteva, Arteva settled with all but about 3 percent of its carpet fiber purchasers through direct or 
individual action. (Hr'g Tr. at 103.) Neither side paid much attention to this PSF category in its filings or in oral arguments."
1385,24," The Court provides a brief description of the relevant facts that pertain to Arteva / KoSa since it is the only remaining 
Defendant. If Plaintiffs are successful  [*26] in proving the conspiracy as alleged in the Amended Consolidated Class Action 
Complaint, Arteva, as an alleged co-conspirator, will be jointly and severally liable for the damages sustained by all class 
members' PSF purchases that are encompassed within the conspiracy. See In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 209 F.R.D. 251, 262 
(D.D.C.2002)."
1385,25," In 2003, a related civil action was commenced in the Southern District of New York by Arteva entities including its parent, 
Koch Industries, Inc., against the Hoechst Celanese entities. See SDNY Civil Docket No.: 1:03CV8679. Koch Industries seeks to 
recover from Hoechst based upon the alleged fraudulent sale of Hoechst's PSF business. Essentially, Koch Industries alleges 
that it purchased a price-fixing conspiracy from Hoechst. The SDNY case is still pending but a review of the docket shows little 
activity since the filing of initial disclosures in August 2004."
1385,26," Arteva does not produce PSF for floor coverings at present. (Latten, P6 n.2)"
1385,27," The fact that Arteva was the sole supplier of certain types of PSF is one of Arteva's defenses to the action. Arteva's argument 
is that the alleged conspiracy could not have affected the PSF purchasing decisions of these entities and, therefore, the fact of 
injury cannot be shown. "
1387,28," In 2001, DuPont admitted participation in a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate customers in the PSF industry. DuPont and 
the other DAK Defendants participated in the U.S. Department of Justice's Corporate Leniency Program in order to avoid 
criminal prosecution. (Class Compl., P64) After months of ongoing grand jury investigation that delayed the progress of the 
instant civil action, the DOJ ultimately elected not to pursue criminal charges against Wellman or  [*33] any of the other alleged 
co-conspirators."
1387,29," Stanley's Plea Agreement was modified on November 10, 2004, several days prior to the actual sentencing hearing, in view of 
an agreement between the United States and the Defendant that an active term of imprisonment was unnecessary in this case. 
(3:02CR230-V, Document # 9)"
1387,30," In support of its motion for partial summary judgment, Arteva contends that this provision reflects a ""basic industry distinction 
between woven and nonwoven fibers."" (Arteva's Mem. In Supp. Summ. J. at 19.) "
1388,31," The findings of the U.S. International Trade Commission are of limited value, but probative of the certification issue 
nonetheless. Arteva implies that the ITC rulings provide conclusive evidence in support of Arteva's theory of the case, i.e., the 
conspiracy was much narrower than alleged by Plaintiffs. At the same time, Arteva criticizes Dr. Beyer for relying extensively on 
the proceedings. Dr. Beyer, like the undersigned, considers the ITC proceedings, along with other sources of information, in his 
study of the PSF industry. (Beyer Trial Reply Rpt., P12) That said, inclusion of the ITC proceedings and determinations in the 
context of evaluating whether certification of a class is appropriate does not mean the Court would necessarily deem this 
evidence admissible at trial. In addition to addressing any other evidentiary objections the parties may raise, the  [*37] Court 
would carefully evaluate this evidence under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence."
1388,32," Defendant ITC Petitioners defined the market for purposes of the anti-dumping investigation  [*38] as: ""synthetic staple fibers, 
not carded, combed or otherwise processed for spinning, of polyesters measuring 3.3 decitex (3 denier inclusive) or more in 
diameter. This merchandise is cut to lengths varying from one inch (25 mm) to five inches (127 mm). Merchandise subject to the 
investigation may be coated, usually with silicon or other finish or not coated. This Polyester Staple is referred to in the Petition 
as ""certain polyester staple fiber."""" (Compl., P51)"
1388,33," Plaintiffs' expert contends that the anti-dumping duties constitute a barrier to entry of the PSF market that aided the 
implementation of the price-fixing conspiracy. "
1390,34, FRCP 23(a)(2) does not require that the common factual and legal issues predominate whereas (b)(3) does.
1390,35," At that time, the common questions were identified as:"
1390,1," ) Whether the prices of Polyester Staple were raised, fixed, maintained or  [*43] stabilized at artificial and non-competitive 
levels;"
1390,2," ) Whether the conspiracy had the effect of fixing, maintaining and stabilizing prices of Polyester Staple in the US; and"
1390,3," ) Whether prices paid by plaintiffs and putative class members were higher than they would have been absent the 
conspiracy."
1390,36," The adequacy of representation inquiry tends to merge with the question of typicality. Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13."
1390,37, The effect of Arteva's defenses is analyzed in greater detail in conjunction with the Rule 23(b)(3) discussion. 
1391,38," There are few examples of ""fundamental"" conflicts identified by the Fourth Circuit. In Broussard v. Meineke, the Fourth Circuit 
held that conflicts of interest existed between different groups of franchisees that precluded certification. Broussard v. Meineke 
Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 338-339 (4th Cir.1998) (securities case). The plaintiff class of franchisees was 
subject to the following categorization: 1) former franchisees with an interest in maximizing damages; 2) current franchisees not 
entitled to any monetary damages given contractual limitations; and 3) current franchisees entitled to monetary damages. 
Broussard, 155 F.3d at 338. Of the current franchisees, several sought only restitution and expressed concern about the long-
term financial health of Meineke in the event defendant was subject to a large damages award. Within the current franchisee 
group, the putative class members were unable to resolve their differences.  [*48] Based on plaintiffs' adverse ultimate 
objectives, the Fourth Circuit determined that ""the remedial interests of those within the single class [were] not aligned."" Id. 
(citing Amchem, 521 U.S. at 627.)"
1391,39," The Court's February 5, 2004 Order was amended in order to clarify precisely what Class Counsel said in relation to certain 
entities' failure to produce fiberfill, namely, that DuPont - as opposed to the other DAK Defendants - did not manufacture fiberfill. "
1392,40," The Windham opinion is instructive but is distinguishable on its facts. The proposed class action in Windham was deemed 
unmanageable due to the number and variety of claims brought by the plaintiffs as well as plaintiffs' different impact and 
damages theories. Windham, 565 F.2d at 66-67, 70. "
1393,41," The Court has  [*55] thoroughly evaluated the evidence presented by both sides regarding the motion for class certification. In 
addition, the Court has evaluated enough of the evidence presented in support and in opposition to the cross-motions for 
summary judgment to rule on certain summary judgment issues. The Court's analysis, however, does not include a complete 
recitation of all the record evidence. "
1394,42," Stanley testified during the Dutton trial that he and Dutton discussed and agreed about the amount of the second price 
increase, the timing of said increase, as well as the ""need to be religious in [their] approach to policing of the agreement."" 
(9/24/03 Dutton Trial Tr. at 285.) Stanley further admitted to having similar conversations with other alleged co-conspirators. (Id. 
at 286-287.)"
1394,43," The parties' summary judgment motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition. (See Documents 503, 509) Plaintiffs urged 
the Court to not consider the summary judgment motions until resolving the motion for class certification. Given the posture of 
the case, it makes sense to proceed with the summary judgment issues that bear upon the presentation of Plaintiffs' direct case. "
1395,44," Compare the language of the price increase announcements during the class period with Arteva's later price increase 
announcement issued after the class period, which expressly states that the increase in price applies only to its ""commodity fine 
denier polyester staple products."" (Hr'g Tr. at 35.)"
1395,45," The Department of Justice did not identify specific victims or any group of victims for purposes of requiring Arteva / KoSa to 
make restitution."
1395,46," In Stanley's own words, his title was ""Business Director for Textile Staples for United States and Canada."" (Stanley Decl., P12)"
1395,47," The word ""highloft"" is another term for nonwovens. (Stanley Dep. at 88.)"
1395,48," Within the instant order, all references to the trial transcript of related criminal proceedings against Robert Bradley Dutton will 
be cited as ""Dutton Trial Tr. at **."" "
1396,49," Plaintiffs argue that Stanley's declaration was ""bought and paid for"" by Arteva. Without weighing the credibility of the witness, 
the Court notes that a jury would not have to discredit Stanley's testimony in order to find that the actual impact (of what has 
already been admitted) exceeded what was originally intended."
1396,50," According to Stanley, he did not discuss the following floor covering and nonwoven customers (all class representatives 
except Gulistan) with his competitors: Gulistan, Tex Tech, Carpenter, Fiber Dynamics, Habasit Belting, J.H.N.Y., Inc., Quality 
Felt, Co., and Southern Fiber, Inc. (Stanley Decl., P40) "
1397,51," Orchestration of price increases is included within a list of ten (10) purported ""Value Added Contributions"" by Stanley."
1397,52," This case may be unique in that the Court did not reach the certification question before discovery was complete. Because the 
Court is essentially reviewing the same record in evaluating both motions, the Court, applying the appropriate standard of review 
for resolving cross-motions, finds that Plaintiffs present sufficient evidence  [*72] of an industry-wide conspiracy to overcome 
Arteva's motion for summary judgment on this particular issue, i.e., scope of the alleged conspiracy. As mentioned, supra, the 
remaining summary judgment rulings will be addressed in a separate Memorandum and Order. "
1398,53," In an earlier ruling denying Defendants' motion to compel ""downstream discovery,"" the Court cited Hanover Shoe in support of 
the rule of law that impact may be presumed in price-fixing or customer allocation conspiracy cases. At that time, the production 
of ""downstream data"" by direct and indirect purchasers of PSF was at issue and the burden associated with Defendants' 
 [*75] request was compared to the probative value of evidence not directly related to the transaction between the PSF 
manufacturer (alleged co-conspirator) and the direct purchaser. "
1399,54," The undersigned questions whether, as a practical matter, the proof as to these two issues can be severed without reliance on 
the Bogosian principle. It seems that the inference recognizes that the antitrust injury and damages inquiries overlap (if not 
embody each other). As a result, the Bogosian shortcut establishes a more manageable framework for analysis. See, In re Bulk 
[Extruded] Graphite Prods. Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16619, 2006 WL 891362, *11 (""[T]he Third Circuit created the 
""Bogosian short-cut"" to deal with the question of impact when there are multiple variables affecting the price paid by the 
plaintiffs."")"
1399,55," Critics refer to this approach - finding that the fact of conspiracy predominates and relying on the Bogosian shortcut to 
demonstrate common impact - as ""drive-by  [*78] certification."" See Morrison, Todd A., Economic Issues in Class Certification, 
Economics and Private Antitrust Litigation Committees ABA Section of Antitrust Law Spring 2004 Meeting. At the time of the 
2004 ABA Spring Meeting, Morrison was Vice President of Dr. Rapp's economic consulting firm, National Economic Research 
Associates Inc. (""NERA""). (Rapp Decl. at 2.)"
1399,56," Plaintiffs do not rely solely on a presumption of injury or impact. Instead, Plaintiff's contend that Arteva's and Troy Stanley's 
guilty pleas give rise to an inference of injury. "
1400,57," Plaintiffs argue that few of the antitrust cases where plaintiff classes are eventually certified evolved out of non-diverse 
industries or met all of the criteria Arteva contends are necessary for class action treatment. After reading its fair share of Rule 
23(b)(3) ""impact"" cases, the Court might reasonably conclude that the typical approach is anything but typical. See ""Antitrust 
Class Actions: Chaos In The Courts,"" 11 Stan. J.L. Bus. & Fin. 1 (2005)."
1400,58," As  [*81] Plaintiffs aptly point out, Arteva fails to cite a single price-fixing or customer allocation case that satisfies all of the 
criteria discussed herein with reference to a ""paradigm"" horizontal price-fixing case."
1400,59," A homogeneous product is ""one identical to the product sold by others in the industry."" (Beyer Trial Reply Rpt., 9 n. 10) (citing 
Samuelson, Paul A. And Nordhaus, Williams D. Economics (Eighteenth Edition), p. 148 (2005)). "
1401,60," At least one court expressly refused to decide whether the product at the heart of the antitrust litigation was an undifferentiated 
commodity product. See In re Bulk [Extruded] Graphite Prods., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16619, 2006 WL 891362, *14 (""Whether 
the market for bulk extruded graphite products is homogeneous and whether prices  [*84] varied widely are substantive issues 
that go to the merits of the case, and are to be resolved by the fact finder."") However, a failure by the Court to resolve this 
underlying factual dispute for purposes of determining whether certification is proper, would fall short of the requisite thorough 
study of the industry. See DeLoach, 206 F.R.D. at 553. "
1402,61," The fabricated flat glass products were primarily used for architectural (glass windows and doors for both residential and 
commercial structures) and automotive (windshields, side and rear  [*89] windows) purposes but were also used as a 
component in the manufacturing of mirrors, doors, appliances and furniture. (Id. at 476.)"
1402,62," With the exception  [*90] of Dupont-Akra's ""list"" prices based upon market segment, there is no evidence that the different 
PSF market categories had wholly separate price lists."
1402,63," Customers' preferences with respect to a particular PSF supplier or product do not compel a finding that uniformity in quality is 
lacking. (Carpenter Dep. at 126-127.) In many cases, customers' preferences had to do more with equipment compatibility and 
overall performance for the intended use than with quality. "
1403,64," To the extent individual proof is necessary to demonstrate impact, this element of proof could be litigated in conjunction with 
an individualized damages inquiry."
1403,65," In his trial report, Dr. Beyer attempts to reflect the differences  [*94] in price, if any, for PSF purchases depending on the size 
of the customer. If this could be accomplished, there would be an even stronger argument for uniformity of price."
1403,66," Like Plaintiffs, the Court does not consider the presumption or inference determinative of any issue given that the undersigned 
now has a complete factual record to rely upon in reaching its decision."
1403,67," Despite Defendants' argument to the contrary, accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true for this limited purpose is entirely 
consistent with the rigorous analysis requirement. In Gariety, the district court erred in accepting at face value Plaintiff's 
characterization of the efficiency of the industry for purposes of a presumption of reliance under a ""fraud-on-the-market theory"" 
(i.e., plaintiffs' assertion that the market is efficient ""is enough at the certification stage to find the market is efficient"") - not 
Plaintiffs' conspiracy theory or allegations as a whole. See Gariety, 368 F.3d at 364 (securities case)."
1403,68," Dr. Beyer also provided the expert economic / econometric evidence relied upon in the Vitamins, Flat Glass, Linerboard, 
Corrugated Container, Carbon Dioxide, Domestic Air, and Mercedes-Benz cases. (Beyer Aff., P3) "
1404,69," Many courts recite familiar language to the effect that class certification does not require the court to resolve a ""battle of the 
experts."""
1404,70, The undersigned has already addressed the characterization of PSF as an undifferentiated commodity. 
1405,71," According to Plaintiffs, ""supply substitutability doesn't mean that every product must be able to be produced on every 
production line."" (Hr'g Tr. at 87.)"
1405,72," Plaintiffs contend that any one of Dr. Beyer's three independent analyses is sufficient and may be relied on by the Court as an 
available method for demonstrating common impact."
1405,73," Arteva posits that 191 of 395 total PSF customers, equal to 48.4%, did not experience any price increase on any polyester 
staple fiber product during the Class Period. (Warren Decl., PP1, 2) According to Arteva, putative class representatives 
Hollander Home Fashions, J.H.N.Y., and Habasit Belting fall within this category. Arteva also represents that for customers that 
purchased PSF both before and after the June 1999 price increase announcement, 84 of the 288 customers (equal to 29.2%) 
did not experience any price increase. (Warren Decl., PP1, 3)"
1405,74," Arteva advances the same argument with respect to damages. However, many class actions still require individual damages 
determinations. Thus, courts consider the presentation of individual proof as to damages less troublesome (from a trial 
management standpoint) than  [*104] individual proof of injury or impact. "
1406,75," The Court questions whether Arteva can pursue an ""indirect purchaser / improper party"" defense against a direct purchaser 
putative class member. "
1407,76," The relevant time period for calculation of damages does not correspond with the alleged period of impact described by Dr. 
Beyer (December 1999 through September 2001) because the class period, as alleged by Plaintiffs' Class Complaint, ends in 
July 2001. (Beyer Trial Rpt., PP41, 46) "
1409,77," A death-knell argument is one that failure to certify the class would be a death knell to (or put an end to) most remaining 
plaintiffs' ability to prosecute their cases individually."
1409,78," In fact, Dr. Beyer's charts indicate that the smaller PSF purchasers are also the putative class members subject to the greatest 
percentage price increases. (Beyer Trial Rpt., Charts 6a-6d)"
1409,79," Arteva does not address any of these possibilities, nor did Arteva suggest an alternative to certification  [*118] of the proposed 
class."
1409,80," Subclasses may also be created to accommodate individual proof or address factual differences amongst class members. In 
re Gen. Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., 594 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir.1979); Campus Cleaners, Inc. v. Dallas Tailor & Laundry 
Supply, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14186, 1977WL1490 (S.D.Tex. 1977); Brown, 92 F.R.D. at 41 (if factual differences between 
plaintiffs are uncovered, division of the class into subclasses might be an option). Arguably, division of the putative class into one 
or more smaller, separate subclasses (in a manner consistent with one of the several categorizations of PSF products proposed 
by the litigants or to distinguish the PSF fiberfill purchasers) might render any given phase of the trial more manageable. In 
certifying the class, the Court does not rule out the possibility of creating  [*119] subclasses to aid in the proper allocation of "
1410,," damages. See Herbst v. Int'l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 65 F.R.D. 13 (D.Conn. 1973). To the extent there are issues unique to one or 
more putative class members, the Court also contemplates submitting special interrogatories to the jury."
1410,81," Arteva has ten days from entry of the Court's Memorandum and Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion For Class Certification to 
request an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Rule 23(f). FED. R. CIV. P. 23(f). "

license dispute, declaratory judgment claims serve to relieve a licensee from the threat of an infringement suit and the injunction 
or damages that might result. In such suits, the declaratory judgment plaintiff often takes legal positions similar to those adopted 
by patent infringement defendants. For example, a licensee who is sued as a patent infringement defendant might raise the 
defense that the patent is invalid. If that same licensee had sufficient reason to believe such a suit would be filed, the licensee 
might file a declaratory judgment suit as a plaintiff, raising the same substantive argument - the patent's invalidity - in the form of 
a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid."

Dec. Comm'r Pat. 320 (1891)). Linzer denies that Newell is a necessary party to this dispute, but nonetheless requests 
permission to join Newell as a declaratory judgment defendant. See 5/2/07 Walter Letter at 1-2. Though Newell may not be a 
necessary party, see infra note 104, this action could result in the invalidation of the '790 Patent, thus Newell should  [**50] be

granted."

Sekar's argument would fail even under that test. As discussed below, Linzer's apprehension of suit is not extinguished simply 
because the potential exists for Newell to exercise its ""right to impede the other co-owner's [Sekar's] ability to sue infringers by 
refusing to voluntarily join in such a suit."" Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1468. Newell, Linzer's direct competitor, has sued Linzer in the

1447,2," The decision was affirmed with respect to the plaintiff's claim that the defendants had unilaterally violated the Oklahoma 
Antitrust Act, its state law claim of tortious interference with its relationship with Ormet Corporation, one of the mills, and its 
tortious interference claim against EMJ. The appellate court also affirmed the exclusion of the report and testimony of one of 
Champagne's expert witnesses."
1447,3," The court allowed the parties to file their briefs and the record under seal. To the extent this opinion cites to sealed portions of 
the briefs and record, those portions are unsealed."
1447,4," Briefly summarized, the plaintiff claims the Established Distributors conspired ""to attempt to keep a new, aggressive entrant out 
of the market,"" Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1086, by threatening to move their business from the mills that sold them 
aluminum, if those mills dealt with Champagne."
1447,5," The parties stipulated at the Oct. 5, 2006, status conference that if the federal antitrust claim survives summary judgment, so 
will the state antitrust claim. "
1448,6," The defendants also claim there is no evidence of any communication among defendants, yet discuss Bill Thomas' alleged 
statement  [*6] that Debbie Veale had told him that she ""had been in contact with her counterparts, who were part of the National 
Association of Aluminum Distributors group."" Defendants' renewed motion, p. 17."
1448,7," Here, unlike the situation in Abraham, the plaintiff is not relying ""solely on circumstantial evidence to prove concerted action."" 
Abraham, 461 F.3d at 1257."
1448,8," There is considerable evidence that controverts the plaintiff's conspiracy claim, e.g. plaintiff's Exhibit 68 demonstrating that 
""Commonwealth's increased sales to Champagne were accompanied by increased purchases from Commonwealth by Integris, 
VMG and Rasco."" Integris' reply brief, p. 2."
1448,9," In reaching its decision, the court has heeded the Tenth Circuit's statement: [W]e emphasize the Supreme Court's admonition in Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 
144 (1987), that individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it. The 
sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts…. [A] piece of evidence, unreliable  [*8] in 
isolation, may become quite probative when corroborated by other evidence. Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1081 at n.6 (quoting Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 179-80)."
1448,10," In its reply brief, EMJ denies an agreement to sell existed, citing deposition testimony of Mike Champagne, which is included 
in an appendix submitted with its reply. It is improper for a party to submit new evidence in a reply brief. (Apparently the 
evidence was included with EMJ's original summary judgment motion, but not its renewed motion. See reply, p. 4). Nonetheless, 
the court has considered the  [*10] testimony and finds the evidence does not negate the existence of an agreement to sell 
Champagne the line."
1448,11," Bill Thomas, a former Commonwealth employee who now works for Champagne, testified that he ""assumed that Jorgensen 
would not object to Commonwealth Aluminum or other mills selling to Champagne, and that other established distributors would 
have little or no objection because of their previous lack of interest in serving the horse trailer industry. I talked to my manager at 
Commonwealth, Terry Wirta, and we agreed that selling mill finish and painted aluminum coil to Champagne should workout for "
1449,," Commonwealth because it did not appear we would be taking business from established distributorships."" Plaintiff's response 
brief Exhibit D, P14."
1449,12," The parties agreed at the October 5, 2006, status conference that the non-deposition statements of mill representatives were 
admissible for summary judgment purposes, eliminating the need for the court to determine whether they are admissible as co-
conspirator hearsay. See Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1080-81 & n.6."
1449,13," ""Champagne introduced evidence that the Established Distributors saw Champagne as a price-cutting competitor who 
threatened their  [*11] market share and profit margins."" Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1086."
1449,14," The court has carefully considered the record submitted to insure that sufficient evidence of each defendant's participation in 
the alleged conspiracy exists to allow the plaintiff's Sherman Act claim against them to proceed to a jury."
1449,15," See plaintiff's Exhibit A, P 31."
1449,16," Defendant EMJ argues that the plaintiff's antitrust claim against it is barred because of the lack of evidence that it engaged in 
any act in furtherance of the conspiracy within the limitations period. However, as there is evidence of anticompetitive actions 
committed by EMJ's alleged coconspirators within the statutory period that suffices to bind it, regardless of its own conduct."
1449,17," The Tenth Circuit did not determine whether the plaintiff's antitrust claim should be analyzed under the rule or reason or 
treated as a per se claim as the district  [*14] court did not rule on the issue and the appellate record was insufficient to permit 
the court to address it. Champagne Metals, 458 F. 3d at 1090 n. 17 & 1092 (""However, even assuming Champagne's collective 
action claim merits per se treatment …. ""). "
1450,18," Although the plaintiff challenges the defendants reference to ""dominant"" market power, the Tenth Circuit has required a 
showing that a defendant ""hold a dominant position in a relevant market."" Diaz, 215 F.3d at 1183."
1450,19," The court accords less significance to Full Draw, 182 F. 3d at 745, a case relied on by the plaintiff, as the Tenth Circuit was 
considering the sufficiency of the complaint, not the evidence required to permit the case to proceed to trial. The same distinction 
applies to the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), 
referenced in the supplemental submissions of the parties. "
1451,20," The Tenth Circuit cited Diaz in Champagne Metals, stating in the case parenthetical that the case explained that the 
determination of whether a group boycott claim is to be judged under a per se or rule of reason standard requires examination of 
the market power and exclusive access factors, plus whether plausible arguments  [*18] exist that justify the challenged conduct. 
Champagne Metals, 485 F.3d at 1090 n. 17."
1451,21," Contrary to the defendants' assertion, defendants' renewed motion, p. 39, the Tenth Circuit did not make that finding. See infra 
pp. 13-14."
1451,22," The fact that the plaintiff has been able to compete at some level does not preclude its antitrust claim or its analysis under a 
per se standard. See generally Northwest Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 294 (""Cases to which this Court has applied the per se 
approach have generally involved joint efforts by a firm or firms to disadvantage competitors by either directly denying or 
persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships  [*19] the competitors need in the competitive struggle. 
""(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Klor's, 359 U.S. at 210 (court considered whether Sherman Act 
prohibited ""a group of powerful business men ""from acting ""in concert to deprive a single merchant, like Klor, of the goods he 
needs to compete effectively. "") (emphasis added)."
1451,23," The Supreme Court has observed that ""'there is more confusion about the scope and operation of the per se rule against 
group boycotts than in reference to any other aspect of the per se doctrine.'"" Northwest Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 294 (quoting 
Lawrence A. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 229-30 (1977)."
1451,24," Citing Shoppin' Bag of Pueblo, Inc. v. Dillon Cos., Inc., 783 F.2d 159, 161-62 (10th Cir. 1986), the defendants assert in their 
reply brief that the plaintiff has failed to address most of the factors relevant to market power. However, that case was evaluating 
the evidence necessary to show the market power required to establish a Section 2 violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, 
not a per se violation of Section 1, as was Bacchus Indus., Inc. v. Arvin Indus., Inc., 939 F.2d 887, 893 (10th Cir. 1991), also 
cited by the defendants."
1451,25," Here, unlike  [*22] the situation in Diaz, the plaintiff has provided the court with some basis for determining how significantly 
the alleged agreement has affected its ability to compete in the relevant market. "
1452,26," The defendants offer no justification for their alleged conduct -- no ""'plausible arguments that they were intended to enhance 
overall efficiency and make markets more competitive.'"" Diaz, 215 F.3d at 1183 (quoting Northwest Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 294). 
Instead, they attempt to discount the significance of this factor."
1452,27," The plaintiff also has submitted evidence showing that the defendants deprived the plaintiff of access to multiple mills, which it 
needed to compete successfully. See Klor's, 359 U.S. at 209-10; Rossi, 156 F. 3d at 464 (""Rossi has adduced evidence that 
GAF product was, if not unique, then at least necessary for him to compete in the marketplace. "")."
1452,28, See supra note 13.
1452,29," Ken-Mac argues that it could not have been part of any per se conspiracy because it does not compete in the same market 
with Champagne Metals. However, the court finds the plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence that the two were competitors to 
preclude entry of summary judgment in Ken-Mac's favor. E.g., plaintiff's  [*23] Exhibit 23, p.29."
1452,30," Medical Supply Chain, Inc. is an unpublished decision cited for persuasive value only under 10th Cir. R. 36.3(B)."
1452,31," While the plaintiff's expert had testified that the defendants' threats deterred other investors from entering the service center 
business in the relevant market, his testimony was not a part of the record, the appellate court having upheld its exclusion by the 
trial court."
1452,32," The defendants also argue that, even if the plaintiff was able to demonstrate a barrier to entry, that would negate its antitrust 
injury, as it would benefit from decreased competition. The flaw in that argument is the plaintiff claims that because of the 
alleged barrier, it is, and has been since it started, at a competitive disadvantage and is not an ""existing competitor[] in the 
market."" Defendants' renewed motion, p. 43 n.10. "
1453,33," As is discussed subsequently, the court did not consider what the defendants identify in their motion to strike as new 
information contained in the Krausse affidavit."
1453,34," See Champagne Metals, 458 F. 3d at 1088 n.15 (""These injuries stemmed from the denial of recognition of Champagne by the 
mills-denials that Champagne alleges were prompted by the pressure put on the mills by the Established Distributors …. Thus, 
the Established Distributors are incorrect to say that Champagne's evidence shows it suffered no injury from acts within the 
limitations period. "")."
1453,35," As mentioned, the defendants are not precluded from reurging their motion insofar as it pertains to the proof of loss issue, if 
appropriate, after the court decides if the plaintiff may revise its expert's report. "
1460,1,"  Linerboard includes any grade of paperboard suitable for use in the production of corrugated sheets, which are in turn used 
in the manufacture of corrugated boxes and for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Corrugated sheets are 
made by gluing a fluted sheet which is not made of linerboard, known as the corrugating medium, between facing sheets of 
linerboard; corrugated sheets are also referred to as containerboard. The defendants named in the instant lawsuits are 
major integrated manufacturers and sellers of linerboard, corrugated sheets, and corrugated boxes. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 202 (E.D. Pa. 2001)."
1460,2," Although the Court does not address in detail Professor White's qualifications or the general reliability of predictive modeling, 
the Court concludes as follows: First, Professor White is well qualified to testify on damages in antitrust cases. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a Professor of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, and is a Founder 
of Bates White, LLC, a consulting firm. He has published in peer-reviewed academic journals on topics in econometrics and 
statistics. His book, Asymptotic Theory for Econometricians,  [**3] is a standard graduate level text in econometrics. Finally, he 
has testified as an expert and directed economic and statistical analysis of damages in several other multidistrict antitrust cases. 
White Rpt. at 17. Second, predictive modeling is a reliable methodology in other contexts. ""Articles published in respected peer-reviewed scientific 
journals report [the use of predictive econometric models] to predict real estate prices, financial earnings, credit risk, marketing 
and advertising outcomes, payroll expenses, . . . and crop yields."" Opp. at 30."
1460,3," Under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), this Court must act as a 
gatekeeper  [**4] to ensure that Professor White is qualified, that his testimony is reliable, and that his testimony fits the facts of 
the case."
1460,4," In ruling upon the Motion to Exclude, the Court did not consider any issues presented by Defendants' Motion for Summary 
Judgment With Respect to Statutes of Limitations, which asks the Court to dismiss plaintiffs' claims as to a portion of the 
damages period."
1460,5," See Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc., 182 F.3d 237, 256 (3d Cir. 1999) (Becker, J.) (The ""expert's testimony, although admissible 
evidence, was insufficient by itself to prove that the antitrust violations had in fact caused [the] losses."") (summarizing 
Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v. Tarmac Roofing Systems, Inc., 63 F.3d 1267 (3d Cir. 1995)). "
1461,6," The class action components of MDL 1261 have been settled. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 2d 631 (E.D. Pa. 
2003). One-hundred and forty entities opted out of the classes. Thirteen groups of opt-outs subsequently filed direct actions 
against defendants. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, 443 F. Supp. 2d 703, 707 (E.D. Pa. 2006). The claims against  [**7] all 
defendants other than defendants Temple-Inland, Inc. (""Temple-Inland"") and Gaylord Container Corp. (""Gaylord"") have either 
been settled or withdrawn. Id. This Memorandum pertains to the remaining direct action plaintiffs and defendants Temple-Inland 
and Gaylord. "
1462,7," The ""fact of damage"" is the impact of the unlawful activity. See In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, 203 F.R.D. 197, 214 (E.D. 
Pa. 2001) (citing Lumco Indus., Inc. v. Jeld-Wen, Inc., 171 F.R.D. 168, 172 (E.D. Pa.1997))."
1462,8,"  Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool for understanding the relationship between two or more variables . . . . [It] is 
sometimes well suited to the analysis of data about competing theories in which there are several possible explanations for 
the relationship among a number of explanatory variables . . . . [It] may also be useful (1) in determining whether a 
particular effect is present; (2) in measuring the magnitude of a particular effect; and (3) in forecasting what a particular 
effect would be, but for an intervening event. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 219 (E.D. Pa. 2001)."
1462,9," Specifically, Professor White's ""charge [was] to determine the extent to which direct action plaintiffs were overcharged . . . as a 
result of an alleged price fixing conspiracy to restrict the supply of linerboard and  [**11] corrugated medium and to elevate the 
prices of linerboard, corrugating medium, and corrugated product in the United States."" White Rpt. P 1 (emphasis added). "
1463,10," Professor White ""estimated the prediction model using standard ridge regression methods,"" which ""has a long history of use in 
statistics and econometrics."" Id. P 134. A regression equation consists of ""a set of coefficients that are associated with each of 
the variables"" selected for the equation. July 2, 2007 Tr. at 50."
1463,11," Incident downtime is involuntary downtime taken by the defendants that is caused, for example, by mill accidents or regulatory 
shutdowns. See July 2, 2007 Tr. at 28-28, 91-92. Professor White ""was careful to distinguish between incident downtime . . . and 
non-incident downtime."" Id. at 98. By including the incident downtime in [his] model, [he] was able to build a prediction that took into account, using the 
underlying drivers of cost and demand, what the presumably lawful and more competitive behavior with regard to other 
types of downtime, market downtime, maintenance downtime, would be during the benchmark period, and that's what's 
relevant  [**14] for the purpose of constructing the but-for line. Id. "
1464,12," Defendants state as follows in their motion: ""Defendants do not question Prof. White's qualifications as an economist or the 
application of his methodology in other contexts. Rather Defendants question whether the methodology Professor White chose 
'fits' the facts in this case and Plaintiffs' theory of this case."" Def.'s Mot. at 11. Defense counsel repeatedly  [**17] stressed 
during the Daubert hearing that defendants were only making a ""fit"" challenge. "
1465,13," Professor White explained that the cross-validated root mean squared error is a measure of the squared error which is a measure of how well or poorly you're doing. The bigger the squared error, the 
worse you're doing, the smaller the better, on average the word ""mean"" conveys that. So it's the average squared error that 
is achieved when you apply the prediction equation to data that haven't been seen for purposes of estimation. July 2, 2007 Tr. at 45. "
1466,14,"  Suppose that an antitrust defendant has engaged in multiple activities that have imposed some injury on the plaintiff. If 
some of the defendant's conduct is lawful and some is lawful, the damage claim will have to be disaggregated. The reason 
for this is clear: . . . a plaintiff may recover a damage award that will return him to the financial position that he would have 
enjoyed but for the unlawful conduct.  [**22] . . . The disaggregation requirement is distinct from the requirement that the 
plaintiff's damage calculations must control for exogenous factors that also have an adverse impact on the plaintiff's 
economic condition. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Anaylsis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application P 391g (2d ed. 
2000) (emphasis added)."
1466,15," Defendants distinguish between their arguments in a manner different from the approach taken by the Court. They state that 
Professor White's method: ""(1) ignores the timing and quantity of downtime taken; (2) ignores other lawful factors that affected 
prices during the relevant period; and (3) fails to quantify the degree to which any economic factor - downtime, restricted 
production, or other - affected prices during the relevant period."" Mot. at 3. The Court addresses each of these arguments in its 
analysis. "
1468,16," Although the Rossi court did not explicitly state that the expert report was admissible, it considered the expert report and 
stated as follows: We do not agree with the defendants' reading of these cases (and, at all events, are not bound by them), which we 
conclude only stand for the proposition that some, not all, ""but for"" models are too speculative and must be precluded as a 
matter of law. The Rockhill Report, as we shall see, is much less speculative and does not suffer from many of the flaws in 
the damage models discussed in Van Dyk Research and Southern Pacific, and thus it is not comparable with them. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 485-86. "
1469,17," Also instructive on this point is J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1540 (3d Cir. 1990), a Third Circuit 
case that discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Texaco Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543, 572, 110 S. Ct. 2535, 110 L. Ed. 
2d 492 (1990): To estimate its lost sales at trial, Hasbrouck's expert presented a market analysis comparing Hasbrouck's actual prices, 
volumes and profits to its estimated amount absent the discrimination. The expert utilized economic projections based upon 
various assumptions such as assuming Texaco did not offer a favored price to its competitors and assuming that Texaco 
lowered its price to Hasbrouck. On appeal, the Supreme Court decided that: [e]ven if some portion of some of the respondent's injuries may be attributable to the conduct of independent retailers, the 
expert testimony nevertheless provided a sufficient basis for an acceptable estimate of the amount of damages. J.F. Feeser, 909 F.2d at 1540 n. 16 (citing Texaco, 496 U.S. at 572)."
1469,18," Other circuits interpret Bazemore to require a defendant to introduce ""evidence to support the contention that the missing 
factor would explain the existing disparities"" revealed by the regression analysis. Palmer v. Shultz, 259 U.S. App. D.C. 246, 815 
F.2d 84, 101 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Sobel v. Yeshiva Univ., 839 F.2d 18, 33-34 (2d. Cir. 1988). Several courts in  [**35] the Third 
Circuit have taken this approach. Churchill v. Int'l Bus. Machines, Inc., Nat'l Serv. Div. U, 759 F. Supp. 1089, 1099 (D.N.J. 1991); "
1470,," Lanning v. Southeastern PA Transp. Auth., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9388, 1998 WL 341605, *66 (E.D. Pa. Jun. 25, 1998), rev'd 
on other grounds, 181 F.3d 478 (3d Cir. 1999). "
1471,19," Defendants stressed during the Daubert hearing that Professor White did not rerun his model using capacity utilization, but 
offered nothing to support that doing so would significantly affect Professor White's results. July 2, 2007 Tr. at 182-83; see 
Bazemore 478 U.S. at 385. The absence of this variable is discussed further in the Court's discussion of the disaggregation of 
defendants' lawful and unlawful conduct, supra. "
1483,1," Because  [**5] of the large capital commitments needed to become a grower for OK, growers must typically raise chickens for 
fifteen to twenty-five years to recover their initial investment."
1483,2," The production cost per pound takes into account the weight of the chickens raised by growers, as well as the cost for chicks, 
medicine,  [**6] and feed. "
1484,3," Beginning in 1997, OK's broiler contracts included a choice-of-law provision designating the law of Arkansas as the governing 
law. The District Court therefore applied Arkansas law to those contracts and Oklahoma law to the contracts pre-dating 1997. "
1485,4," This Court had recognized three ""exceptionally narrow"" grounds supporting a district court's departure from an appellate 
 [**11] court's earlier ruling: ""(1) when the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different; (2) when controlling authority 
has subsequently made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues; or (3) when the decision was clearly erroneous 
and would work a manifest injustice."" McIlravy, 204 F.3d at 1035 (quotation omitted)."
1485,5," It is undisputed that OK is a ""live poultry dealer,"" defined as ""any person engaged in the business of obtaining live poultry by 
purchase or under a poultry growing arrangement for the purpose of either slaughtering it or selling it for slaughter by another."" 7 
U.S.C. § 182(10). "
1486,6," HN7[
] Under 7 U.S.C. § 209, any person subject to the PSA may be held liable for damages. Liability may be enforced either by complaint to the Secretary of Agriculture ""as provided in section 210 of this title,"" or through proceedings instituted in federal 
district court. 7 U.S.C. § 209(b). Under 7 U.S.C. § 210, however, only stockyard owners, market agencies, and dealers (not 
including live poultry dealers) may be found liable in proceedings before the Secretary of Agriculture. In addition, the Secretary 
may issue cease and desist orders and assess civil penalties against packers and swine contractors, but not poultry dealers, 
under 7 U.S.C. § 193. In other words, the Secretary has no adjudicative authority over  [**18] live poultry dealers. Hence, the 
only way to enforce § 202 of the PSA against a live poultry dealer is to file suit in federal district court under 7 U.S.C. § 209. "
1487,7," In addition, we emphasize that we are interpreting the meaning of unfairness solely in the context of the PSA. Consequently, 
the Supreme Court's decision in FTC v. Sperry and Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972), which 
addresses similar language in § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), does not dictate a particular 
interpretation in this case. Unlike the case before us, the question in Sperry and Hutchinson was one of agency jurisdiction, 
namely whether § 5 empowered the FTC to define ""unfair practices"" to include practices without anticompetitive effects and of a 
noncompetitive nature. Id. at 239. Conversely, as we note above, the present case does not involve the USDA's interpretive or 
enforcement authority under the statute. Instead, we are faced with the task of construing a statute that only the federal courts 
may enforce against live poultry dealers."
1487,8," We are not concerned here with predatory intent on the part of OK. That issue was not raised by the parties, and we therefore 
express no opinion on whether evidence of predatory intent can make an act ""unfair"" when there is no concomitant showing of a 
likelihood of competitive injury. "
1490,9," Indeed, we have recognized that § 202(a) focuses on conduct and does not require proof of wrongful intent: ""Nothing in the 
language of [ § 202(a)] . . . requires a showing of wrongful intent. To the contrary, the focus is solely on the acts committed or 
omitted."" Excel Corp., 397 F.3d at 1294."
1490,10," The danger of increased consumer prices is especially acute when the monopsonist resells in a monopolized market. See 
PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT  [**33] HOVENKAMP, 3 ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES 
AND THEIR APPLICATION § 720a n.1 (2005). "
1491,11," Although this case does not involve horizontal price-fixing by a group of buyers, OK's alleged practices manipulate the market 
in a similar fashion: ""[M]arket manipulation in its various manifestations is implicitly an artificial stimulus applied to (or at times a 
brake on) market prices, a force which distorts those prices, a factor which prevents the determination of those prices by free 
competition alone."" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 223, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940) 
(explaining price-fixing as a form of market manipulation). Like illegal price-fixing agreements, a monopsonist's use of supply 
contracts to manipulate the market poses the risk  [**37] that prices will be determined by artificial, rather than market, forces."
1491,12," In acknowledging that an insurer could use its market power to ""keep prices down,"" the court in Kartell noted that the lower 
prices the insurer paid doctors for their services did not result in higher consumer prices, 749 F.2d at 930-31, and that both 
parties ""sit on opposite sides of the bargaining table,"" id. at 929  [**40] (quotation omitted). We are confronted with a potentially 
different arrangement in the case before us. The record contains evidence that OK's practices are likely to increase end-user 
prices. Moreover, the supply contracts with the Growers give OK complete control over the input market (i.e., the chickens 
available to OK for purchase), leaving the growers with little, if any, ability to bargain. "
1492,13," At this juncture, we would like to note that both parties flouted their duty under this Circuit's rules to include in the record the 
relevant motion for summary judgment, supporting brief, and response. See 10th Cir. R. 10.3(D)(2). Though we are not required 
to do so, we have obtained copies of the documents. But we advise that in the future the parties diligently adhere to the rules of 
 [**43] the Circuit if they wish to avoid unwittingly waiving arguments. "
1500,1," Although styled as ""motions to determine,"" the Court treats Bamberg's and the Endosurgical Defendants' motions as motions 
for partial summary judgment."
1500,2," At oral argument, counsel for the Endosurgical Defendants noted that Bamberg also had a contract directly with the 
Endosurgical [*5]  Defendants which committed it to a specific pricing plan under the Premier GPO agreement. "
1511,1," The Court's wide-ranging discussion did not include a comprehensive list of the factors relied on, but courts and commentators 
have generally recognized these five. See, e.g., Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co., 190 F.3d 1051, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 1999); 
see also, e.g., McCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 850 (3d Cir. 1996) (identifying different factors). "
1514,2," The complaint in Philip Morris Inc. alleged, inter alia, that tobacco companies restrained and suppressed research on the 
harmful effects of smoking and restrained and suppressed the dissemination of information on the harmful effects of smoking. 
551 N.W.2d at 492. It did not allege that the tobacco companies interfered with or manipulated delivery of patient care. "
1515,3," We note that the Supreme Court recently opined on the minimum factual allegations that must be pleaded to support a claim of 
restraint of trade under section 1 of the Sherman Act. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,     U.S.    , 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 
(2007). Because the price-fixing conspiracy at issue here is, in the present posture of the case, undisputed, Twombly is not 
helpful to our decision. "
1516,4," Lorix indicated at oral argument that her proposed class did not include purchasers of tires attached to used cars, and that any 
suggestion to the contrary in her complaint was a ""drafting error."" We find this limitation sensible and are confident the district 
court can craft other sensible limits on the proposed class. We also note that Lorix has apparently abandoned her earlier 
position, espoused at the court of appeals, that any Minnesota citizen could sue Crompton because the price-fixing raised the 
price of tires, which raised the price of transportation, which raised the price of all goods transported by truck within the state. "
1518,5," We recognize that the cost and difficulty of settlement administration, combined with attorneys' fees, mean that indirect 
purchaser suits sometimes result in no meaningful recovery for consumers. See Crouch, 2004 NCBC LEXIS 6, 2004 WL 
2414027, at *12 (""[T]he complexities and administrative costs and difficulties [in administering settlements] result in settlements 
that are something less than sterling from the consumer's point of view.""); William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, Should 
Indirect Purchasers Have Standing to Sue Under the Antitrust Laws? An Economic Analysis of the Rule of Illinois Brick, 46 U. 
Chi. L.Rev. 602, 634 (1979) (""In a class action, much of even the compensatory portion of the judgment may end up in the 
pockets of lawyers or in state treasuries, rather than in the pockets of the people who were actually harmed by the antitrust 
violation.""). We also recognize that indirect purchasers suits sometimes use the threat of unmanageable and complex litigation 
to compel settlement. See Milton Handler, The Shift From Substantive to Procedural Innovations in Antitrust Suits--The Twenty-
Third  [**41] Annual Antitrust Review, 71 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 9 (1971). Whatever benefits or detriments indirect purchaser litigation 
confers on society, it is not the place of this court to restrict remedies that the legislature has made available."
1518,6," The court in Crouch summarized the difficulties: First, the price-fixed item is a product consumed or altered in the manufacturing process. Accordingly, its use will vary with 
the type of rubber product being made. It may also vary with the nature of the product (chemical) being used and how it is 
used in the manufacturing process. Different direct purchasers (here, tire manufacturers) might use the various chemicals 
in various ways in differing products."
1518,2004," NCBC LEXIS 6, 2004 WL 2414027, at *21. The Crouch court also estimated, based on the price of tires, amount of rubber 
processing chemicals present, and capacity for price inflation in the industry, that an individual purchaser may have been 
damaged by $ 0.01 to $ 0.11 per tire. Id. While we take note of the Crouch court's thorough, thoughtful opinion, it includes facts 
that are not part of the record before us. "
1520,1," I will refer to contractors that use Local 3 labor as ""Local 3 contractors,"" and to contractors that use CWA labor as ""CWA 
contractors."""
1520,2," The plaintiffs initially asserted claims under both § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act but have since withdrawn their § 2 
claims. U.S. Info. Sys. v. IBEW Local Union No. 3, No. 00 Civ. 4763, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52870, 2006 WL 2136249, at *1 n.1 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2006)."
1520,3," All  [*4] claims against defendants IPC Communications, Inc. (""IPC"") and Forest Electric Corporation have been dismissed by 
stipulation. "
1521,4," The plaintiffs, by contrast, contend that ""[i]n the early days of telecommunications, installations were done only by the 
telephone company monopolies utilizing CWA labor."" (Pl. Memo. at 8). "
1522,5," In many cases, construction projects are placed on an accelerated schedule, and contractors must use overtime labor in order 
to complete the project on time. (Def. 56.1 Stmt., P 8; Pl. 56.1 Stmt., P 8). "
1523,6," During the same time period, telecommunications cables, light fixtures, and ""bathroom speakers"" disappeared from the job site. 
(Lott Dep. at 133-36)."
1523,7," After these problems began, the vice-president of Lehrer McGovern Bovis (""LMB""), the general contractor on the project, wrote 
to Arthur Blee of Constructa, Inc. (""Constructa""), a representative of the building owner, stating that ""LMB verbally advised 
Constructa . . . on numerous occasions that it would not be wise to award this contract to a non-Local 3 contractor."" The letter 
lists a number of problems encountered as a result of the decision to use CWA labor, including the refusal of Local 3 electricians 
to perform overtime when asked, and states that ""there is no way that LMB can force the men to work if they don't want to."" 
(Letter of Harold Lyons  [*14] dated Nov. 29, 1999 (""Lyons Letter""), attached as Exh. 58 to Andrews Decl.). "
1524,8," Telecommunications cables at the construction site were also cut on several occasions. (Pastore Dep. at 42, 47-48). "
1526,9," The statutory labor exemptions contained in the Clayton Act, see 15 U.S.C. § 17; 29 U.S.C. § 52, and the Norris-LaGuardia 
Act, see 29 U.S.C. §§ 104, 105, 113, ""exempt certain union activities from antitrust scrutiny."" Local 210, 844 F.2d at 79. The 
statutory labor exemptions ""do not . . . reach concerted activity between a union and a nonlabor party, such as an employer."" Id. 
(citations omitted). Accordingly, they are inapplicable here. See U.S. Info. Sys. v. IBEW Local Union No. 3, No. 00 Civ. 4763, 
2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1038, 2002 WL 91625, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2002). "
1527,10," Article III, Rule 3(m) states that the foreman must call the union to ask for permission for the electricians to work overtime. 
(Agreement and Working Rules between New York Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., Association of Electrical Contractors, 
Inc., and Local 3 (""CBA""), attached as Exh. 114 to Toner Decl. and as Exh. 50 to Andrews Decl., Art. III, Rule 3(m)). Rule 5 
states that overtime is not permitted except in emergencies and that members may not work overtime without permission from 
the Local 3 Business Manager's Office. (CBA, Rule 5). The defendants note that ""[t]here is no clause in the CBA which obliges 
an individual worker to work any overtime at all."" (Affidavit of Joseph D'Angelo dated Aug. 24, 2005, attached as Exh. 122 to 
Toner Decl.,  [*29] P 4). However, Thomas Carino, Sr. formerly the Chief Operating Officer of IPC, testified that under the 
collective bargaining agreement, workers do not have the right to refuse to work overtime if the contractor requests it. (Excerpts 
of Deposition of Thomas Carino, Sr., attached as Exh. 3 to Andrews Decl., at 195-97)."
1527,11," Article VII states in part that ""[t]here will be no strikes, no work stoppages or slow down[s] or other interferences with the work 
because of jurisdictional disputes."" (CBA, Art. VIII)."
1527,12," The defendants also claim that the alleged agreement between the defendants would be subject to the ""construction industry 
proviso"" of § 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (the ""NLRA""), 29 U.S.C. § 158(e). That provision exempts certain aspects 
of the construction industry from the NLRA's ban on so-called ""hot cargo clauses"" in collective bargaining agreements. Local 
210, 844 F.2d at 72-73. A ""hot cargo clause"" is an agreement by an employer, at the union's behest, ""to boycott the goods or 
services of other employers that did not comply with union standards or recognize a union."" Id. at 72 (citations omitted). The 
alleged conspiracy at issue here does not involve such an agreement,  [*30] and therefore does not appear to fall within the 
scope of the proviso. However, even assuming that it does, the proviso protects employers and unions within the construction 
industry only from scrutiny under § 8(e) of the NLRA. In order to be exempt from antitrust scrutiny, an agreement that is subject 
to the construction industry proviso must also fall within the scope of ""'one of two recognized labor law exemptions from antitrust 
scrutiny -- the statutory and non-statutory exemptions.'"" Drywall Tapers & Pointers, Local Union Local 1974  v. Bovis Lend Lease 
Interiors, Inc., No. 05 Civ. 2746, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19632, 2005 WL 2205836, at *15 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2005) (quoting Local 
210, 844 F.2d at 79). As explained above, neither of these exemptions applies here."
1527,13," ""Conduct considered illegal per se is invoked only in a limited class of cases where a defendant's actions are so plainly 
harmful to competition and so obviously lacking in any redeeming pro-competitive values that they are 'conclusively presumed 
illegal without further examination.'"" Capital Imaging Associates, P.C. v. Mohawk Valley Medical Associates, Inc., 996 F.2d 537, 
542 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 8, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979)); see also Leegin

1528,14," The plaintiffs must also ""adequately . . . define the relevant product market."" Rock TV Entertainment, Inc. v. Time Warner, Inc., 
No. 97 Civ. 0161, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 799, 1998 WL 37498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 1998) (quotations and citation omitted). 
However, the defendants have stated that they ""are not challenging the 'relevant market' for purposes of this motion."" (Joint Def. 
Memo. at 4 n.4). "
1529,15," The plaintiffs contend that the meeting was held specifically to discuss the issue of jobs lost to CWA contractors, but there is 
no evidence to that effect. Nor is there any direct evidence that any of the defendant contractors besides NIS attended the 
meeting. (See Eccles Dep. at 122-26, 132, 139; Excerpts of Deposition of Raymond A. Melville, attached as Exh. 20 to Andrews 
Decl., at 164-65)."
1529,16," In September 1998, Mr. Eccles himself met with a representative of Local 3 to discuss the fact that Nead was losing 
telecommunications bids to CWA contractors. (Eccles Dep. at 108). In a letter to Mark Hansen, a business agent for Local 3, Mr. 
Eccles stated, ""We are losing as much work to CWA as we are winning now and [it is ] getting worse."" (Letter of Robert Eccles 
dated Sept.  [*39] 1, 1998 (""Eccles Letter""), attached as Exh. 54 to Andrews Decl.). Mr. Eccles sought a meeting with Mr. 
Hansen ""to discuss this problem and review any recommendations you may have to competing in this marketplace [sic]."" (Eccles 
Letter). Mr. Eccles eventually met with Howard Cohen of Local 3, but according to Mr. Eccles, Mr. Cohen ""listened intently and 
nothing happened."" (Eccles Dep. at 108). "
1530,17," Indeed, there is no evidence that the representatives at the meeting discussed Nead's list of concerns at all; Mr. Eccles 
testified that he did not think that Mr. Marziotto ""ever got a chance to speak"" at the meeting. (Eccles Dep. at 126)."
1530,18," Although Shearman & Sterling's landlord did specifically ask the firm to hire NIS, its stated reason for doing so was it would 
make the work more efficient because Nead Electric was the ""house vendor"" and therefore the company was familiar with the 
building. "
1531,19," Nor do the plaintiffs dispute that ADCO, in an apparent attempt to avoid delays, reassigned six workers who had refused to 
work overtime. This kind of behavior indicates that Five Star and ADCO sought to mitigate the damage caused by their workers' 
actions, rather than use it as a bargaining tool to force customers to give the telecommunications contract to a Local 3 
contractor."
1531,20," Of course, the customer might be able to avoid conflict with Local 3 electricians by hiring a different Local 3 contractor for the 
telecommunications work. But the defendant contractors could reasonably assume that since they were already on the job and 
could begin right away, the customer would be reasonably likely to choose them as the replacement telecommunications 
contractor.  [*46] Indeed, Five Star, ADCO, and Hugh O'Kane were each awarded telecommunications work on the projects in 
question after their employees began to cause construction delays. Although the Complaint refers to ""numerous instances"" in 
which electrical contractors whose employees stopped working overtime or committed vandalism ""did not seek or obtain the 
telecommunications installation work"" (Sec. Compl., P 40), the plaintiffs have put forward no admissible evidence to that effect."
1531,21," ""Virtually all large commercial construction sites in the New York metropolitan area utilize only union labor"" (Pl. Memo. at 6), 
and the vast majority of, if not all, union electricians in the New York City area are members of Local 3. (Sec. Compl., P 20). "
1532,," Although a general contractor or building owner might be able to hire a non-unionized electrical contractor, that decision would 
hardly be a practical one, since  [*48] it would invite protests by Local 3 and other building trades workers on the job site."
1532,22," The plaintiffs also contend that in the absence of a conspiracy, the defendant contractors would have disciplined those 
workers who refused to work overtime. (Pl. Memo. at 28, 30-31). However, the defendant contractors' decision not to enforce 
any remedy they may have had under the collective bargaining agreement could be a rational one even in the absence of a 
conspiracy. For example, the contractors may have chosen not to enforce the collective bargaining agreement in order to 
maintain peace with Local 3."
1532,23," It is therefore unnecessary to address the plaintiffs' request that I reconsider my August 1, 2006 decision insofar as it barred 
the plaintiffs from relying on a series of judicial and administrative decisions that document Local 3's ""total job policy"" of using 
work stoppages, violence, and vandalism to obtain tel-data installation work. (Pl. Memo. at 5 n.6, 33-43). Even assuming that the 
total job policy remains in effect, unilateral action by Local 3 to keep CWA out of the tel-data installation trade does not violate 
the Sherman Act. It is also unnecessary to address the defendants' contention that, under § 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 
U.S.C. § 106, in order to hold Local 3 responsible for any acts by its members or officers, the plaintiffs must present ""clear proof"" 
that the union participated in, authorized, or ratified the alleged act. (Joint Def. Memo. at 12-13; Local 3 Memo. at 8-9). "
1533,24," One federal district  [*53] court opinion rejected claims under both § 1 of the Sherman Act and the Donnelly Act because, 
based on the evidence, an inference of conspiracy was no more plausible than a finding that the defendants had acted 
unilaterally. Tokarz v. LOT Polish Airlines, No. 96 CV 3154, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72118, 2006 WL 2850611, at *4-*5 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 3, 2006). The court relied, however, only on the general proposition that the Donnelly Act is construed consistently with the 
Sherman Act. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72118, [WL] at *3. "
1538,1," Plaintiff also argues that defendants' conduct should be subject to ""quick look"" analysis, citing Law v. NCAA, 134 F.3d 1010, 
1020 (10th Cir. 1998). In Law, the Tenth Circuit applied a truncated rule of reason analysis to an NCAA rule limiting salaries of 
graduate-assistant basketball coaches to $ 16,000, which it characterized as  [*17] a horizontal price fix with obvious 
anticompetitive effect and summarily condemned without an analysis of the defendant's market power. Id. Here, unlike Law, 
plaintiff does not allege any agreement on prices in the market for listings IT services. ""Quick look"" treatment is inappropriate. "
