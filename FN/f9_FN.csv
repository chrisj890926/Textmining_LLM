29,1," The docket sheet incorrectly refers to Electrolux with the ""Inc."" designation for an incorporated entity."
29,2," Although named as a plaintiff in paragraph 14 of the Amended Complaint, CBS is not listed as a party on the docket. 
Conversely, Viacom, Inc. is listed as a plaintiff on the docket but is not named as a plaintiff in the Amended Complaint. "
31,3," Although not a feature of his brief, Defendant Di Bernardo joins in this argument. (Di Bernardo Br. at 15.)"
31,4, Pl.'s Br. Opp. Carbone refers to the brief filed in opposition  [**9] to the Carbone Defendants' motion to dismiss.
31,5," The parties agree that the FTAIA applies because Plaintiffs allege harm from ""conduct involving trade or commerce . . . with 
foreign nations,"" that is, purchases of electrical carbon products outside the United States. 15 U.S.C. § 6a. "
33,6," On remand, the D.C. Circuit rejected the viability of this theory. Empagran S.A. v. F. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Ltd., 368 U.S. App. 
D.C. 18, 417 F.3d 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1043, 126 S. Ct. 1043, 163 L. Ed. 2d 857(2006). Holding that 
there could be no jurisdiction over foreign injuries unless domestic conduct was the proximate cause of that  [**16] harm, the 
Court found insufficient the allegation of a single global market. The appellants paint a plausible scenario under which maintaining super-competitive prices in the United States might well 
have been a ""but-for"" cause of the appellants' foreign injury. As the appellants acknowledged at oral argument, however, 
""but-for"" causation between the domestic effects and the foreign injury claim is simply not sufficient to bring anti-competitive 
conduct within the FTAIA exception. The statutory language-""gives rise to""-indicates a direct causal relationship, that is, 
proximate causation, and is not satisfied by the mere but-for ""nexus"" the appellants advanced in their brief. Id. at 1270-71. The Third Circuit has not decided the viability of the global cartel theory or the level of connection a plaintiff must 
allege between American effects and foreign injury. "
34,7," Because the Court is dismissing claims related to purchases abroad, the Court will not decide whether it has personal 
jurisdiction over Defendant  [**21] Le Carbone Lorraine; it appears that all claims against Le Carbone Lorraine are dismissed for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FTAIA. "
36,8," According to Plaintiffs, Defendant Michel Coniglio, who has not appeared in this matter: simultaneously held executive-level positions in Defendants LCL and Carbone of America during the Relevant Period. On 
behalf of Defendant LCL, Mr. Coniglio served as Vice-President of the Advanced Materials and Technologies Division, 
Vice-President of North America and South America and as a member of the Company's Executive Committee. At the 
same time, Mr. Coniglio served as President and Chief Executive  [**28] Officer of Carbone of America. During the 
Relevant Period, Mr. Coniglio was employed by and acted as an agent for LCL and Carbone of America, during which time 
Mr. Coniglio participated in the worldwide conspiracy to fix prices of Electrical Carbon Products sold in the United States. (Am. Compl. P 30)."
36,9," In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the filing of the class action complaint tolled this action. Although this appears to be true, it also 
appears irrelevant because the claims were filed within four years of November 2002 and the Plaintiffs have stated a claim for 
fraudulent concealment until that date, as discussed below. Therefore, the Court need not address whether Plaintiffs assert 
claims as to new products that were not asserted in and not tolled by the class action."
36,10," Because Plaintiffs have adequately pled that Defendant Di Bernardo was a member of the conspiracy, the Court will also toll 
the statute of limitations on claims against him for fraudulent concealment until November 2002. See Davis v. Grusemeyer, 996 
F.2d 617, 624 (3d Cir. 1993). "
38,11," When adjudicating a case under state law, this Court must ""predict how the highest court  [**34] of that state would decide the 
relevant legal issues."" Kowalsky v. Long Beach Twp., 72 F.3d 385, 388 (3d Cir. 1995)."
38,12," The Third Circuit does not appear to have decided whether that same tolling should apply to Plaintiffs who opt out of class 
actions that are certified.  [**35] The reasoning of American Pipe, that tolling promotes the efficacy of Rule 23 by preventing 
individual actions, would not apply if the Court permitted tolling for those class members who opted out of class actions where 
class certification is ultimately granted. On the other hand, the ability to opt out is an important aspect of Rule 23(b)(3), which 
courts should also be reluctant to undermine. "
39,13," Alternatively, Plaintiffs could assert Michigan antitrust claims for conduct arising after September 23, 2001, under the ordinary 
four-year statute of limitations. However, the Amended Complaint indicates that the antitrust conspiracy terminated sometime in 
September 2001. "
40,14," He also moved to dismiss the Michigan claims on personal jurisdiction grounds, but because the statute of limitations has run 
on those claims, the Court need not address personal jurisdiction as to the Michigan  [**45] claims. "
51,1," Plaintiffs Bridgestone Americas Holding, Inc. and Bridgestone Firestone North American Tire, LLC have reached a settlement 
in principle and have not filed an opposition to the motion. After the Motions to Dismiss were filed, the parties also stipulated to 
the dismissal with prejudice of the Second Cause of Action in the Amended Complaint, for violations of Tennessee state 
antitrust law, against all Defendants. (C 06-5700, Docket No. 119.) "
53,2," For the same reason, the three post-Empagran district court cases cited by Defendants do not squarely tackle the issue now 
before the Court. In each of those cases, the plaintiffs at issue  [**16] did not participate in the U.S. market and could not draw a 
causal relationship between domestic anticompetitive effects and any of the injury they alleged. See Latino-Quimica-Amtex S.A. 
v. Akzo Nobel Chemicals B.V., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19788, 2005 WL 2207017 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2005); In re 
Monosodium Glutamate, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39641, 2005 WL 2810682 at *1 (D. Minn. Oct. 26, 2005); In Re Dynamic 
Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8977, 2006 WL 515629 at * 2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2006). "
54,3," The problematic nature of Plaintiffs' assertion that they are merely asserting a single ""claim"" is underscored by their 
acknowledgment that they are actually asserting an amalgamation of claims, not only those native to the named Plaintiffs, but 
those assigned to the named Plaintiffs by their foreign affiliates and subsidiaries. (Amended Complaint PP 14-19, Opposition at 
4 n.4.) Plaintiffs cannot convert a non-justiciable claim, originally accrued by a foreign affiliate or subsidiary and asserting only 
independent foreign injury, into a justiciable claim merely by  [**22] assigning it to another plaintiff that holds a justiciable claim."
54,4," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984), cited to by Plaintiffs, 
is inapposite. Copperweld deals not with whether the Sherman Act reaches foreign injury that is independent of domestic 
anticompetitive effects, but with the definition of conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. As Copperweld indicates, a 
parent and subsidiary are generally not able to form a Section 1 conspiracy because they are not typically ""two independent 
sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests."" Id. at 771. "
55,5," The Court declines Plaintiff's invitation to adopt different interpretations of the causation portion of the FTAIA test reached by 
some lower courts before the decisions in Empagran II. For example, the Court finds that Crompton Corp. v. Clariant Corp., 220 
F. Supp. 2d 569 (M.D. La. 2002) and In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8903, 2001 WL 755852 (D.D.C. 
June 7, 2001), cited by Plaintiffs at oral argument, are not inconsistent with the principles and reasoning articulated in Empagran 
I and Empagran II."
55,6," Subsequent district court decisions around the country have applied the D.C. Circuit's proximate causation test when analyzing 
the domestic-injury exception of the FTAIA. See Latino-Quimica-Amtex S.A. v. Akzo Nobel Chemicals B.V., 2005 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 19788, 2005 WL 2207017 at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2005); In re Monosodium Glutamate, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39641, 
2005 WL 2810682 at *3 (D. Minn. Oct. 26, 2005); In Re Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 8977, 2006 WL 515629 at * 4-5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2006). "
56,7," In the alternative, Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs lack standing under the Sherman Act to pursue their claims of foreign 
injury. This analysis implicates many of the same jurisdictional issues under the FTAIA, and the same considerations that 
mandate a finding of no subject matter jurisdiction weigh against a finding of antitrust standing. However, in view of  [**28] the 
Court's dismissal of the Sherman Act claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, there is no need for consideration of 
Defendants' alternative contention that Plaintiffs lack standing."
56,8," Because Defendants bring only a facial Rule 12(b)(1) challenge, the Court did not consider the content of the Sasse 
Declaration or other evidence not pleaded in the complaint when determining whether to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims as currently 
pleaded. See Wolfe v. Strankman, 392 F.3d 358, 362 (9th Cir. 2004). However,  [**30] the Court now considers the content of 
such evidence for purposes of determining whether leave to amend should be granted. "
58,9," Moreover, Defendants' contention that the active concealment ceased before October 2002 raises  [**34] factual issues outside 
the scope of the Amended Complaint. As with the factual dispute regarding due diligence, the Court finds these issues 
inappropriate for resolution at the pleadings stage; they are better addressed in the Rule 56 context."
58,10," The Court therefore need not reach Defendants' assertions that the class action tolling doctrine does not apply to Plaintiffs' 
claims, nor the individual Defendants' assertions that Plaintiffs should not be permitted to rely on the tolling provisions of Section 
5(I) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(I). Given the Court's finding that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded fraudulent "
59,," concealment up and until October 2002, Plaintiffs do not need to separately obtain the benefit of the class action  [**38] tolling 
doctrine to render timely their claims for injury as far back as 1993. "

66,2," Gold Strike was originally named as a defendant in this action, but it later settled plaintiffs' claims against it."
66,3," Callicott attended the May 30, 2001 TCOA meeting. "
67,4," In mid-2002, Callicott and Memphis radio personality Rudi Schiffer also became involved with TWA's  [**7] efforts to market 
""tunica.com"" to the casinos."
67,5," Gold Strike entered into a contract with TWA whereby TWA was permitted to book certain bus tours to Gold Strike on a 
commission basis. TWA never referred any bus tours to Gold Strike under the contract."
67,6," The casinos also filed a number of counterclaims against Graziosi and TWA, but those counterclaims are not at issue on this 
appeal."
67,7," See Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943)."
67,8," See E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961);  [**8] United 
Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
67,9," The district court held that Graziosi did not individually have standing to pursue the antitrust claims. Although Graziosi is listed 
as an appellant, she does not appear to challenge the district court's standing ruling on appeal. "
68,10," The district court found, and the parties do not dispute, that TWA's federal and state antitrust  [**11] claims are analytically 
identical. See Walker v. U-Haul Co., 734 F.2d 1068, 1070 (5th Cir. 1984). "
69,11," Although, as the district court found, the casinos might well have had a number of valid, independent reasons why they might 
decline to do business with TWA and ""tunica.com,"" those plausible reasons for independent action do not establish that 
appellees are entitled to summary judgment where the plaintiff has come forward with direct, rather than circumstantial, evidence 
of concerted action, since direct evidence of agreement necessarily tends to exclude the possibility of independent action. See 
Viazis, 314 F.3d at 762 (HN6[
] ""[A]n antitrust plaintiff who is unable to present direct evidence of a conspiracy must introduce 
evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action."") (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); 
Miles Distribs. v. Specialty Constr. Brands, Inc., 476 F.3d 442, 449 (7th Cir. 2007)  [**16] (""When a plaintiff attempts to defeat 
summary judgment by highlighting circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy, some of the evidence must tend to exclude the 
possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently rather than in concert."") (emphasis added). "
70,12," Earlier in the opinion, however, the Spectators' Communication Network court noted that ""[t]o make a per se case, the 
horizontal agreement need not be between competitors of the victim."" Id. at 223. "
71,13," See also Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 141 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that horizontal 
boycott of supplier was not per se unlawful because the ""conspiracy did not disadvantage a competitor"" of the boycotting 
parties); Kenneth L. Glazer, Concerted Refusals to Deal Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 70 Antitrust L.J. 1, 31-41 (2002) 
(suggesting that per se rule should not apply to horizontal boycotts carried out exclusively by firms that are not direct competitors 
of the victim, because firms that are either upmarket or downmarket of the victim ordinarily have no economic incentive to 
reduce or inhibit competition at the victim's market level)."
71,14," This court's decisions in Blackburn and Plueckhan are, of course, not good law to the extent that they limit application of the 
per se rule to horizontal boycotts in a manner not authorized by Northwest Wholesale Stationers and later cases. Moreover, 
Blackburn and Plueckhan both rely on a definition of a ""horizontal"" agreement that is inconsistent with the definition adopted by 
the Supreme Court in Business Electronics Corp. and NYNEX."
71,15," See also William C. Holmes, Antitrust Law Handbook § 2:19, at 303 (2007 ed.) (noting category of per se cases involving 
concerted, horizontal action ""directed 'vertically' at . . . suppliers or customers"")."
71,16," Superior Court is, admittedly, somewhat distinguishable from this case, as it involved a boycott that was specifically designed 
to effectuate a price-fixing agreement among the conspirators, but it nevertheless undercuts appellees' claim that direct 
competition with the victim is an indispensable element of a per se unlawful boycott. "
72,17," We agree with the district court that TWA and the casinos are not in competition with each other. TWA operates a website. 
The casinos own and operate casinos, hotels, and other leisure-related activities. They simply do not compete for the same 
customer base. Although the casinos own and operate their own websites, they have never leased websites nor sold internet 
advertising. As the district court correctly concluded, ""the casinos were simply prospective customers of [TWA], nothing more."" Moreover, because we remand to the district court for consideration  [**28] of the admissibility of TWA's proffered evidence, we 
do not reach the casinos' additional argument that there is insufficient evidence that Hollywood Casino participated in any 
conspiracy. We also do not consider the casinos' additional argument that TWA cannot establish an antitrust injury. The district 
court did not reach that argument, and the defendants are free to reurge it on remand. Finally, we reject the casinos' immunity 
claims for essentially the reasons stated in the district court's November 24, 2004 order. "

that statement as true, the Court notes that no such statement appears on the face of plea agreement. A disclosure by the 
government that the carved out individuals are or were in the past subjects of a grand jury investigation would, indeed, appear to 
violate Rule 6(e). The flaw in this argument is that the plea agreement does not contain such a statement."
228,3," The Hammond comments state, in relevant part: Most corporate plea agreement provide a non-prosecution agreement for company employees who cooperate fully in the 
investigation. Yet certain culpable employees, employees who refuse to cooperate, and employees against whom the 
Division is still developing evidence may not receive protection under the company plea agreement. These individuals are 
often referred to as ""carve outs,"" meaning they are excluded (or ""carved out"") of the company deal. Culpable carve outs 
must negotiate separate plea agreement or face indictment. Most companies place a high value on minimizing the number 
of carve outs. Second-in companies that cooperate early in an investigation often have the advantage of being able to offer new and 
significant evidence through multiple employees. When this  [**14] is the case, the Division will typically carve out only the 
highest culpable individuals as well as any employees who refuse to cooperate; mid-to-lower level employees who provide "
229,," significant evidence furthering the investigation will be offered non-prosecution under the corporate plea agreement. In 
addition, those employees who are carved out often are able to negotiate more favorable deals because they are in a

major integrated manufacturers and sellers of linerboard, corrugated sheets, and corrugated boxes. "
317,," In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 202 (E.D. Pa. 2001)."
317,2," Defense counsel represents both Inland and Gaylord because ""Gaylord was acquired by Temple-Inland"" after the events at 
issue in this case transpired. July 5, 2007 Tr. at 65-66.  [**3] ""At the time of the conduct in this case[,] Gaylord was an entirely 
separate company [that had] nothing to do with Temple-Inland."" Id. at 66. "
322,3," In In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig. 321 F. Supp. 2d 619 (E.D. Pa. 2004), the Court noted that ""Plaintiff Classes' expert 
constructed an econometric model and determined that over the class period, prices for boxes and sheets were 2.7 percent 
higher than they would have been absent the alleged conspiracy…. [T]he result was total damages in the amount of $ 478 
million over the class period."" Id. at 632."
322,4, The Court also noted that 
323,," Defendants would have been able to argue that these two economic forces-sharply rising costs and increased demand-
contributed to the steep price increases more than the allegedly collusive downtime in 1993. This counter-theory combined 
with the other weaknesses in Plaintiff Classes' evidence raises not insignificant risks to establishing liability and damages. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 296 F. Supp. 2d 568, 579 (E.D. Pa. 2003). "
324,5," HN13[
] ""Resort to per se rules is confined to restraints . . . that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition 
and decrease output."" Leegin, 127 S.Ct. at 2713 (quotation omitted) (holding that, in contrast to horizontal price-fixing 
agreements, vertical minimum-resale-price agreements do not justify application of the per se rule)."
324,6,"  HN14[
] An agreement on output also equates to a price-fixing agreement. If firms raise price, the market's demand for 
their product will fall, so the amount supplied will fall too-in other words, output will be restricted. If instead the firms restrict 
output  [**27] directly, price will as mentioned rise in order to limit demand to the reduced supply. Thus, with exceptions not 
relevant here, raising price, reducing output, and dividing markets have the same anticompetitive effects. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 215-16 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (citing Gen. Leaseways, Inc. v. Nat'l Truck Leasing 
Ass'n, 744 F.2d 588 (7th Cir. 1984) (Posner, J.))."
324,7,"  HN16[
] Tacit collusion, sometimes called oligopolistic price coordination or conscious parallelism, describes the process, 
not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a 
profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with 
respect to price and output decisions. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). "
325,8," The Third Circuit has held that HN20[
] ""the Matsushita standard applies only when the plaintiff has failed to put forth direct evidence of conspiracy."" Intervest, 340 F.3d at 160 (citations omitted). ""This is because direct evidence obviates the fact finder's 
need to make inferences of a conspiracy, and therefore the Supreme Court's concerns over the reasonableness of inferences in 
antitrust cases evaporate."" Id. (citations omitted). Whether or not Twombly  [**31] affects this holding in any way, this Court has 
recognized that ""[t]here is no direct evidence of any meeting at which defendants agreed to take downtime or to raise prices and 
there was no direct evidence of conversations in which one conspirator agreed with another to take reciprocal downtime."" In re 
Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, [WL] at *12 (E.D. Pa. 2004). Thus, Matsushita applies. "
327,9," Defendants do not dispute this point. Brown, July 5, 2007 Tr. at 99 (stating that ""plaintiffs' theory in the case is that Inland had 
never taken down time before, which is correct""). "
329,10," According to plaintiffs, ""the record shows . . . Beal [sic] was one of Roger Stone's right hand men."" July 6, 2007 Tr. at 5."
329,11," According to James Doughan, executive vice president of Stone, storage costs were minute. Specifically, Doughan testified as 
follows: Q. Yes, but the cost of holding the inventory -- A.  [**47] Peanuts. Q. --would accumulate. But it would accumulate it, would it not? A. It's peanuts. Q. Would it accumulate? A. Sure. But it's peanuts. "
330,, Doughan Ark. Dep. 162:16-163:7; SCC 063588-647 at 629.
330,12," Inland's 30(b)(6) witness originally stated in deposition that the final decision was on July 7, 1993. Zimbelman Dep. 1 at 247. 
He later testified that the final decision occurred sometime between July 1, 1993 and July 7, 1993. Id. "
331,13," In Temple-Inland Inc.'s and Gaylord Container Corporation's Motion to Strike Inadmissible Evidence (Document No. 925, filed 
June 8, 2007), defendants argue that the Court should not consider Inland's and Gaylord's internal antitrust compliance policies 
because ""What matters in this case  [**51] … is not whether Inland and Gaylord violated their own policies but, rather, whether 
they violated the antitrust laws. It would be one thing if Inland's and Gaylord's policies tracked the antitrust laws. But here, Inland 
and Gaylord fashioned policies that were much stricter than the antitrust laws."" Def.'s Evid. Mot. at 28. The Court agrees that it 
should not look to these policies for the law upon which to base its decision. The policies are relevant, however, as they relate to 
why Howes felt uncomfortable with communications with competitors. "
335,14," Specifically, Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that HN33[
] Whenever the United States is hereafter injured in its business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the 
antitrust laws it . . . shall recover threefold the damages by it sustained and the cost of suit. The court may award under this 
section, pursuant to a motion by the United States promptly made, simple interest on actual damages for the period 
beginning on the date of service of the pleading of the United States setting  [**67] forth a claim under the antitrust laws 
and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for 
such period is just in the circumstances. In determining whether an award of interest under this section for any period is just 
in the circumstances, the court shall consider only-- (1) whether the United States or the opposing party, or either party's representative, made motions or asserted claims 
or defenses so lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay or otherwise 
acted in bad faith; (2) whether, in the course of the action involved, the United States or the opposing party, or either party's 
representative, violated any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory behavior or 
otherwise providing for expeditious proceedings; (3) whether the United States or the opposing party, or either party's representative, engaged in conduct primarily for 
the purpose of delaying the litigation or increasing the cost thereof; and (4) whether the award of such interest is necessary to compensate the United States adequately for the injury 
sustained by the  [**68] United States."
335,15, U.S.C. § 15(a). 
336,15," Consistent with this description, the Supreme Court later explained in West Virginia v. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 107 S. Ct. 
702, 93 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1987) that HN36[
] ""[p]rejudgment interest serves to compensate for the loss of use of money due as 
damages  [**70] from the time the claim accrues until judgment is entered, thereby achieving full compensation for the injury 
those damages are intended to redress."" Id. at 310 n.2 (emphasis added)."
336,16," The Court notes that Professor White calculated the opportunity cost associated with plaintiffs' lost use of funds by computing 
""present value"" through an interest calculation. White Rpt. P 185. In Poleto v. Conrail Corp., 826 F.2d 1270 (3d Cir. 1987), 
abrogated on other grounds, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 110 S. Ct. 1570, 108 L. Ed. 2d 842 
(1990), the Third Circuit noted that HN37[
] prejudgment interest ""represents past economic loss … properly adjusted to 
present value through an interest calculation."" 826 F.2d at 1278 n.14. See also Robinson v. Fetterman, 387 F. Supp. 2d 483, 
485 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (citing Poleto, 826 F.2d at 1278 n. 14). The difference between ""present value"" damages and pre judgment interest is one of terminology rather than substance. See 
also Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application P 392a, at 
493-94 (2d. ed. 2003) (noting that a present value damage award ""may seem fair"" but ""is nonetheless equivalent to an award 
 [**71] of pre-judgment interest"") (hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp). In contrast, the mere fact that ""damage[s] can be computed in terms of 'interest' does not make it impermissible prejudgment 
interest."" Pacific Gas and Electric Co., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21414 , 1993 WL 299219 at *4. "
338,17," Areeda & Hovenkamp explains that the ""prohibition of pre-judgment interest as a matter of course provides an incentive to 
disguise prejudgment interest as something else."" Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp P 392a, at 493-94. Multiflex, 709 F.2d 
at 987 is ""a case in which '[t]he court seems to have been misled by the fact that the plaintiff made an economic argument rather 
than a transparent claim for statutory or common law prejudgment interest. This would seem to be an error.'"" Def.'s Rep. at 43 
n.32 (quoting Areeda & Hovenkamp P 392a, at 494). "
346,1," Hackman alleges that Gregory Hackman is an individual person who did business as Gregory Hackman Realtors and Gregory 
Hackman Realtors, Inc. For ease of discussion this memorandum opinion and order refers to both plaintiffs collectively as 
""Hackman."""
346,2," Since Century 21 has since settled with Hackman and Hackman has voluntarily dismissed it from this litigation, I do not 
consider its motion to compel arbitration; that motion is denied as moot. "
347,3," Plaintiffs submitted a petition for a temporary restraining order on November 30, 2006, the same day that they filed the present 
complaint. However, on December 1, 2006, plaintiffs withdrew that petition, and it has not since been renewed. "
348,4," The parties have not presented a complete copy of the Code of Ethics, but the portions I have reviewed do not show that the 
Code of Ethics has any choice of law provision or any other indication that the law of another state applies to interpret its 
requirements. "
349,5," In his supplemental response Hackman does not dispute that the document to which Parvin refers is part of the document 
referenced in the RAAR bylaws, and is therefore incorporated as part of the contract I must interpret. "
350,6," As noted below in section IV.C. supra, I do not believe that Hackman has stated a claim with respect to these general 
allegations under the pleading standard articulated in Bell Atlantic. However, to the extent Hackman may later state those claims 
with the specificity required under the standard, they do not appear to be within the scope of the arbitration agreement. "
351,7," In United Phosphorus, Ltd. v. Angus Chem. Co., 322 F.3d 942 (7th Cir. 2003), the Seventh Circuit explained that HN9[
] where subject matter jurisdiction is not evident on the face of the complaint, a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is analyzed 
""as any other motion to dismiss, by assuming for purposes of the motion that the allegations in the complaint are true."" Id. at 946 
(citations omitted). "
353,8," Count II also alleges that Dickerson, Whitehead, Coldwell, Century 21, Prudential and McKiski violated Section 3(3) of the 
Illinois act, but I need not consider this allegation since Hackman has not brought it against RAAR. "
355,9," Although Bell Atlantic addresses a case in which claims were brought only under § 1 (restraint of trade) of the Sherman Act, its 
reasoning applies equally to claims brought under § 2 (monopolization) where the plaintiff alleges that the defendants had a 
monopoly through combination or conspiracy with one another, as Hackman alleges here."
355,10," Hackman alleges that his dispute with the defendants began in 2000, but he does not allege any facts showing when their 
purported conspiracy to shut  [**39] him out of the Rockford-area real estate market began. "
356,11," Hackman's complaint lumps together defamation claims on behalf of Gregory Hackman Realtors and Hackman Realtors Inc., 
referring to both collectively  [**42] as ""Hackman."" Defamation allegations on behalf of either entity are sufficient to state a claim. 
HN18[
] A certain line of Illinois appellate cases suggests that corporate plaintiffs bringing claims for defamation per se must 
allege that the defendant made a statement that ""assail[s] a corporation's financial or business methods"" or accuses the 
corporation of fraud or mismanagement. See, e.g., Am. Int'l Hosp. v. Chicago Tribune Co., 136 Ill. App. 3d 1019, 1024, 91 Ill. 
Dec. 479, 483, 483 N.E.2d 965, 969 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (citations omitted). Even under this stricter application of the per se rule 
Hackman's complaint states a claim because it alleges that Licary stated the collective ""Hackman"" was dishonest, which is akin 
to an accusation of fraud. Licary and Prudential have cited no cases that a false statement that a corporate entity was dishonest 
is not within the definition of per se defamation under Illinois law. "
357,12," Illinois courts have variously designated this tort as interference with prospective economic advantage, Fellhauer, 142 Ill.2d at 
511, 154 Ill. Dec. at 656-57, 568 N.E.2d at 877-78, interference with prospective economic relationships, Kruger v. Menard Elec.

prospective business expectancies, Downers Grove Volkswagen, Inc. v. Wigglesworth Imports, Inc., 190 Ill. App. 3d 524, 527, 
137 Ill. Dec. 409, 412, 546 N.E.2d 33, 36 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989). The Restatement uses the term interference with prospective

416,3," Since the hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, three plaintiff States -- New Hampshire, Ohio, and Texas - have filed 
voluntary notices  [**17] of dismissal, and dismissals were ordered by the court on July 6, 2007, June 25, 2007, and August 15, 
2007, respectively. Accordingly, those plaintiff States' claims are no longer at issue, and for purposes of this order, the court 
omits all reference to them."
416,4," Defendants have also filed a motion to dismiss similar claims alleged in a separate but related case brought by the New York 
State Attorney General. See In re DRAM Antitrust Litigation, member case no. C 06-6436 PJH, State of New York v. Micron 
Technology, et al. The merits of that motion are discussed by way of a separate order, filed concurrently herewith. "
417,5," For purposes of the instant order, the court refers to plaintiff Northern Mariana Islands as a plaintiff ""State."" "
419,6," Specifically, plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of 12 plaintiff States' state agencies, and on behalf of 9 plaintiff States' political 
subdivisions. See FAC at P 115. "
420,7," Defendants seek dismissal on this ground of the following plaintiff States' claims on behalf of natural persons: Kentucky, 
Louisiana, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, and South Carolina. Defendants seek dismissal of the following plaintiff 
States' claims brought on behalf of government entities: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Northern Mariana "

] (""The attorney general may proceed under any 
antitrust laws in the state or federal courts on behalf of this state, any of its political subdivisions or agencies, or as parens 
patriae on behalf of natural persons in this state."")(emphasis added). Despite this expansive language, however, the Cartwright 
Act is nonetheless unavailable to plaintiff State Utah, for the reasons given above in connection with standing under the 
language of the statute itself. This result applies to parens patriae claims brought by Utah on behalf of residents, as well as 
claims brought on behalf of government entities. See FAC at P 115. "
423,9," Defendants originally  [**45] moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claim for disgorgement or restitution pursuant to Texas state law. 
However, in view of the court's August 15, 2007 order granting plaintiff State Texas' voluntary dismissal of its claims, defendants' 
argument is now moot. "
434,10," Defendants originally sought dismissal of all claims brought pursuant to Illinois' antitrust statute, as well. However, in their reply 
brief in support of their motion to dismiss, defendants stated that, upon review of the authorities cited in plaintiffs' opposition 
brief, defendants had decided ""not to seek dismissal of Illinois' claims on intrastate commerce grounds"" at the present time. 
Defendants' argument as to Illinois was, and is, accordingly withdrawn. "
441,11," In response to Frito-Lay, Congress passed the Scott-Hart-Rodino Act, which does specifically grant state Attorneys General 
the parens patriae authority to sue for monetary damages on behalf of natural persons, pursuant to federal antitrust law. "
443,12," Plaintiff State Illinois submitted an opposition objecting to defendants' request that the court take notice of the Daicel 
Chemicals decision. The court hereby OVERRULES the objection. "
444,13," Defendants have also moved to dismiss plaintiff State Mississippi's parens patriae claims on behalf of businesses specifically, 
on grounds that the statutes pursuant to which plaintiffs bring suit do not expressly authorize suits on behalf of ""businesses."" 
However, since defendants make this argument conclusorily, and provide no controlling authority in support thereof, the court 
accordingly rejects it. "
456,1," Previous generation standards were more limited in their capacity for data transmission. The first generation  [**5] (""1G"") 
standard was analog and could transmit voice communication but little or no data. The second generation (""2G"") standard was 
digital and had limited data-transmission capacity. A 2.5G standard added more data-transmission capacity. Future generation 
standards with greater data-transmission capacity are currently in development, and are known as the ""beyond-3G"" (""B3G"") and

in the discretion of the court."
459,15, U.S.C. § 2.
459,3," HN6[
] Because market share and barriers to entry are merely surrogates for determining the existence of monopoly power, 
see 2A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application P 531a 
(2006) [hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp], direct proof of monopoly power does not require a definition of the relevant market. 
See PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 107-08 (2d Cir. 2002) (stating that ""a relevant market definition is not a 
necessary component  [**16] of a monopolization claim"" where there is direct evidence of monopoly power); Conwood Co., L.P. 
v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 783 n.2 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting that monopoly power ""may be proven directly by evidence of 
the control of prices or the exclusion of competition, or it may be inferred from one firm's large percentage share of the relevant 
market"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Toys ""R"" Us, Inc. v. FTC, 221 F.3d 928, 937 (7th Cir. 2000) "

and by showing that the defendant's share exceeds whatever threshold is important for the practice in the case""). "
461,4," In their brief, SDO Amici explain the competition that occurs between firms in the telecommunications standard-setting process. 
Prior to the adoption of a standard, firms compete on the basis of their respective technologies and intellectual property 
positions. Each SDO Amicus has policies in place to require competing firms to disclose all relevant patents and licensing 
commitments. Such policies facilitate an informed comparison of the firms and their technologies, and are ""part of an effort to 
preserve the competitive benefits of ex ante technology competition."" (IEEE Br. 10 (IEEE Standards Association); see also id. 12 
(VITA Standards Organization); 16 (OASIS Open (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)).) 
Thus, the selection of a standard is, itself, the product of a competitive process. "
463,5," In related litigation before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Court observed of Rambus's conduct 
that even if the SSO [i.e., standard-setting organization] itself is not corrupt, the subversion of an SSO by a single industry 
player or by a limited subset of SSO members can result in anticompetitive outcomes. Thus, antitrust  [**29] law 
historically has been concerned with the risk of one or a small number of participants capturing the economic power of an 
industry-wide standard and turning the SSO into a source of exclusionary power. Simply put, by hijacking or capturing an 
SSO, a single industry player can magnify its power and effectuate anticompetitive effects on the market in question. Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 330 F. Supp. 2d 679, 696-97 (E.D. Va. 2004)."
463,6," The concurring opinion reiterated the FTC's finding that Rambus violated § 2 of the Sherman Act when it ""effectively 
transmogrified [the SDO's] procompetitive efforts into a tool  [**31] for monopolization."" Rambus, No. 9302, 2006 FTC LEXIS 60, 
concurring op. at 1 (F.T.C. Aug. 2, 2006)."
463,7," Although several district court decisions appear to cut against the trend, they are easily distinguishable. In Hynix 
Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 441 F. Supp. 2d 1066, 1080-81 (N.D. Cal. 2006), the Court balanced the competing policies 
underlying patent and antitrust law and concluded that Rambus's ""breach of the [SDO] disclosure policies, without more, 
cannot give rise to antitrust liability."" Significantly, however, the Court also noted that ""Hynix is not barred from asserting that 
Rambus's overall course of conduct, which may include the circumstances and intent behind its decision to not disclose its "
464,," patents and patent applications, violated antitrust laws."" Id. at 1081. It  [**32] should be noted that the FTC's Rambus decision 
considered all of the ""circumstances"" and followed a lengthy trial on the merits. See Rambus, No. 9302, 2006 FTC LEXIS 60, 
[slip op.] at 51. Another readily distinguishable decision is Townshend v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., No. C99-0400SBA, 2000 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 5070, 2000 WL 433505, at *7, *10-11 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 28, 2000), a case cited approvingly by the District Court. The Court 
in Townshend dismissed an antitrust claim alleging that, prior to the adoption of a standard incorporating proprietary technology, 
proposed licensing terms that violated the SDO's patent policy had been submitted to the SDO, and litigation involving the 
relevant IPRs had not been disclosed. In dismissing, the Court found no allegation that the misrepresentation caused the SDO to 
adopt defendant 3Com's technology over competing technologies, and no allegation that defendant 3Com demanded license 
fees inconsistent with those that the SDO considered before adopting the standard. "
465,8," We are unpersuaded by Qualcomm's argument that antitrust liability cannot turn on so vague a concept as whether licensing

484,3," The focus in attempted monopolization cases on a defendant's ""specific intent"" to monopolize and on the ""dangerous 
probability"" that monopoly will result traces its roots to the Supreme Court's earliest pronouncements on the Sherman Act. Over 
one hundred years ago, Justice Holmes explained that the Sherman Act permits claims against combinations in restraint of 
commerce among the states and against attempts to monopolize the same. Intent  [**12] is almost essential to such a 
combination, and is essential to such an attempt. Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law 
seeks to prevent--for instance, the monopoly,--but require further acts in addition to the mere forces of nature to bring that result 
to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen. But when that 
intent and the consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like many others, and like the common law in some cases, 
directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the completed result. Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 
375, 396, 25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518 (1905) (citation omitted). By contrast, in monopolization cases, monopolistic intent can be 
inferred from the exclusionary conduct of a firm with monopoly power. United States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 F.2d 416, 432 
(2d Cir. 1945) (Hand, J.) (noting that, in a monopolization case, ""no intent is relevant except that which is relevant to any liability,

346 (D. Mass. 1953) (""Defendant  [**13] intended to engage in the leasing practices and pricing policies which maintained its

485,4," For example, in the telecommunications field, it is common for companies to offer not only phone service, but also Internet 
access and television service, and many of these companies offer bundled discounts to customers who purchase their entire 
package. See Ken Belson, Dial M for Merger, N.Y. Times, Jan. 28, 2005, at C1; Ken Belson, Cable's Rivals Lure Customers with 
Packages, N.Y. Times, Nov. 22, 2004, at C1."
485,5," That bundled discounts are a common feature of our current economic system is relevant to our analysis of allegedly 
anticompetitive conduct under § 2 of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court, in assessing the stare decisis effect of its 
 [**17] prior precedents under § 1 of the Sherman Act, recently noted that ""[f]rom the beginning the Court has treated the 
Sherman Act as a common-law statute,"" and that ""[j]ust as the common law adapts to modern understanding and greater 
experience, so too does the Sherman Act's prohibition on 'restraint[s] of trade' evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic 
conditions."" Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2705, 2720, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (third alteration

antitrust review, but it heightens the need to ensure that the rule adopted does not expose inventive and legitimate forms of price 
competition to an overbroad liability standard. "
486,6," The Supreme Court has recognized the principle that package pricing is usually procompetitive, noting that ""[b]uyers often find

491,12," McKenzie contends that Brooke Group is not persuasive in this case because Brooke Group dealt with liability for primary-line 
price discrimination in violation of § 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, whereas this case arises under § 2 of the Sherman Act. 
However, the Court made clear in Brooke Group that, whether a predatory pricing claim arises under § 2(a) of the Robinson-
Patman Act or § 2 of the Sherman Act, the concerns are essentially the same, noting that: There are, to be sure, differences between the two statutes. For example, we interpret § 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn 
predatory pricing when it poses ""a dangerous probability of actual monopolization,"" whereas the Robinson-Patman Act 
requires only that there be ""a reasonable possibility"" of substantial injury to competition before its protections are triggered. 
But whatever additional flexibility the Robinson-Patman Act standard may imply, the essence of the claim under either 
statute is the same: A business rival  [**42] has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard 
competition and thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market. "
492,," Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222 (citations omitted)."
492,13," Of course, HN16[
] even if the exclusionary conduct element is satisfied by bundled discounts at price levels that yield a conclusion of below-cost sales, under the appropriate measure, there cannot be Sherman Act § 2 liability for attempted 
monopolization unless the other elements of a specific intent to monopolize and dangerous probability of success are satisfied. "
493,14," In the academic literature, this standard is sometimes referred to as a ""discount allocation"" or ""discount reallocation"" standard. 
See e.g., Daniel A. Crane, Multiproduct Discounting: A Myth of Nonprice Predation, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 27, 28 (2005). "
494,15," A variation of the example from Ortho illustrates how the discount attribution standard condemns discounts that could not be 
matched by an equally or more efficient producer of the competitive product. Recall that the example involves A, a firm that 
makes both shampoo and conditioner. A's incremental cost of shampoo is $ 1.50 and A's incremental cost of conditioner is $ 
2.50. A prices shampoo at $ 3 and conditioner at $ 5, if purchased separately. However, if purchased as a bundle, A prices 
shampoo at $ 2.25 and conditioner at $ 3. Purchased separately from A, the total price of one unit of shampoo and one unit of 
conditioner is $ 8. However, with the bundled discount, a customer can purchase both products from A for $ 5.25, a discount of $ 
2.75 off the separate prices,  [**51] but at a price that is still above A's variable cost of producing the bundle. Applying the 
discount attribution rule to the example, we subtract the entire discount on the package of products, $ 2.75, from the separate 
per unit price of the competitive product, shampoo, $ 3. The resulting effective price of shampoo is thus $ 0.25, meaning that, if a 
customer must purchase conditioner from A at the separate price of $ 5, a rival who produces only shampoo must sell the 
shampoo for $ 0.25 to make customers indifferent between A's bundle and the separate purchase of conditioner from A and 
shampoo from the hypothetical rival. A's pricing scheme thus has the effect of excluding any potential rival who would produce 
only shampoo, and would produce it at an incremental cost above $ 0.25. However, as we noted above, A's incremental cost of 
producing shampoo is $ 1.50. Thus, A's pricing practices exclude potential competitors that could produce shampoo more 
efficiently than A (i.e., at an incremental cost of less than $ 1.50). A's discount could thus be considered exclusionary under our 
rule, supporting Sherman Act § 2 liability if the other elements were proved. "
495,16," Professor Nalebuff identifies the practical problem of calculating a rival firm's costs as a compelling argument in favor of a 
standard that focuses on whether bundled discounts would exclude a hypothetical equally efficient competitor: There is . . . a practical problem in determining if a rival firm is equally efficient or not. The problem is compounded 
 [**56] for the monopolist who is looking for a bright line test to know whether its bundled pricing might be exclusionary or 
not. The solution to both these problems is to pick the monopolist itself as the equally efficient rival. Nalebuff, supra, 50 Antitrust Bull. at 330."
495,17," Although the volume of case law dealing with bundled discounting is small, one thirty-year-old case shows that antitrust claims 
based on bundled discounting practices are nothing new under the sun. See SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 427 F. Supp. 
1089, 1124 (E.D. Pa. 1976), aff'd, 575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir. 1978)."
495,18," A 1975 article by Professors Areeda and Turner ignited the modern debate about predatory pricing, see Phillip Areeda & 
Donald F. Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975), 
and many prominent antitrust scholars weighed in on the topic in the following decade-and-a-half. See, e.g., Robert H. Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox 154-55 (1978); George A. Hay, Predatory Pricing, 58 Antitrust L.J. 913 (1989); Frank H. Easterbrook, 
Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263 (1981); Paul L. Joskow & Alvin K. Klevorick, A Framework

Matsushita, 61 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1052 (1986) (discussing the history of predatory pricing theory in the courts and academic 
literature). "
496,19," At least one circuit has held that average total cost, not average variable cost, is the appropriate baseline for determining 
predation. See McGahee v. N. Propane Gas Co., 858 F.2d 1487, 1500 (11th Cir. 1988). However, such an approach is 
inconsistent with the Supreme Court's instruction in Brooke Group that predatory prices are those below "" 'some measure of "
497,," incremental cost.'  [**62] "" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 223 (quoting Cargill, 479 U.S. at 117-18 n.12) (emphasis added). As the 
Antitrust Law treatise explains: In the ordinary case a predator increases output out of existing facilities, cutting the price to predatory levels. For this 
reason the Supreme Court has emphasized that predators must have excess capacity from which to produce the increased 
output. But in that case, the only ""incremental"" cost of the predation is variable costs."
497,3," Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 741c at 444 (2d ed. 2002) (footnote omitted)."
497,20," In a number of cases decided before Brooke Group, we held that pricing below marginal  [**63] cost or average variable cost 
provided evidence that a pricing scheme was predatory, but also held that that mode of proof was not exclusive. See 
Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377, 1385 (9th Cir. 1983); Inglis, 668 F.2d at 1033. We suggested that an 
above-cost pricing policy could be predatory if accompanied by evidence of predatory intent, market power, or ""long-run 
behavior."" See Transamerica, 698 F.2d at 1387. Other circuits rejected the notion that predation could be proved through 
evidence of intent alone, see, e.g., Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 232, and Brooke Group 's holding that ""a plaintiff seeking to 
establish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low prices must prove that the prices complained of are below an appropriate 
measure of its rival's costs"" put to rest any notion that predation can be proven through evidence of intent alone, Brooke Group, 
509 U.S. at 222."
497,21," As we noted above, the AMC's proposed standard in bundled discounting cases, in addition to requiring below-cost pricing, 
also contains two further proposed elements. The second element proposed by the AMC is that there is a dangerous probability that the defendant will recoup its investment 
in the bundled discounting program. AMC Report, supra, at 99. This requirement, adopted from Brooke Group, is imported from 
the single product predatory pricing context, but we think imported incorrectly. We do not believe that the recoupment 
requirement from single product cases translates to multi-product discounting cases. Single-product predatory pricing, unlike 
bundling, necessarily involves a loss for the defendant. For a period of time, the defendant must sell below its cost, with the 
intent to eliminate its competitors so that, when its competition  [**65] is eliminated, the defendant can charge supracompetitive 
prices, recouping its losses and potentially more. By contrast, as discussed above, exclusionary bundling does not necessarily 
involve any loss of profits for the bundled discounter. See Nalebuff, supra, 50 Antitrust Bull. at 327. As the example from Ortho 
illustrates, a bundled discounter can exclude its rivals who do not sell as many product lines even when the bundle as a whole, 
and the individual products within it, are priced above the discounter's incremental cost to produce them. The trier of fact can 
identify cases that present this possibility for anticompetitive exclusion by applying the discount attribution standard outlined 
above. Under that standard, the ultimate question is whether the bundled discount would exclude an equally efficient rival. But 
because discounts on all products in the bundle have been allocated to the competitive product in issue, a conclusion of below-
cost sales under the discount attribution standard may occur in some cases even where there is not an actual loss because the 
bundle is sold at a price exceeding incremental cost. In such a case, we do not think it is analytically helpful to think  [**66] in 
terms of recoupment of a loss that did not occur. The third element proposed by the AMC is that ""the bundled discount or rebate program has had or is likely to have an adverse 
effect on competition."" AMC Report, supra, at 99. We view this final element as redundant because it is no different than the "
498,," general requirement of ""antitrust injury"" that a plaintiff must prove in any private antitrust action. See Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 
(defining antitrust injury as ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful"" and noting that ""[t]he injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation""). For these reasons, while adopting the AMC's proposal to require below-cost sales to prove exclusionary conduct, we do not 
adopt the element of recoupment, which we think may be inapplicable in some cases, and we do not adopt the element of 
""adverse effect on competition"" as we think that is superfluous in light of the general and pre-existing requirement of antitrust 
injury under Brunswick."
498,22," PeaceHealth also argues that because the jury found in its favor on McKenzie's claim of exclusive dealing under § 1 of the 
Sherman Act, it is entitled  [**68] to judgment as a matter of law on McKenzie's claim of attempted monopolization under § 2 of 
the Sherman Act. Our vacatur of the jury's verdict on the attempted monopolization claim makes it unnecessary for us to fully 
address that argument. However, we previously have held that ""[t]he 'predatory or anticompetitive conduct' element of § 2 
attempt, like the conduct element of monopolization, encompasses more than violations of § 1."" Cal. Computer Prods., Inc. v. 
IBM Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 737 (9th Cir. 1979). Specifically, § 1 is limited to concerted activity, while § 2 reaches unilateral 
exclusive conduct. See id. ;Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70."
498,23," HN26[
] Price discrimination claims can take three forms: primary line, secondary line, or tertiary line. Primary-line price 
discrimination includes conduct, like predatory pricing, that injures the direct competitors of the discriminating seller. See Volvo 
Trucks, 546 U.S. at 176, 126 S. Ct. at 870. Secondary-line price discrimination includes conduct that injures competition 
between the customers of a discriminating seller, as, for example, when one seller charges two customers different prices for the 
same good. See id. Tertiary-line price discrimination includes conduct that injures competition between the customers of the 
direct purchasers of a discriminating seller. See id."

refer to portions of exhibits that, while submitted to the district court in support of PeaceHealth's motion for summary judgment, 
did not have their relevant portions highlighted for the district court. Under the district court's Local Rule 56.1(c)(3), the moving party is required to highlight relevant portions of documents 
presented to the court, and under Local Rule 56.1(e), ""the Court has no independent duty to search and consider any part of the 
court record not otherwise referenced in the separate concise statements of the parties."" D. Or. R. 56.1. However, all of the 
documents cited by PeaceHealth on appeal were before the district court, even if not highlighted. Moreover, the principal policy "
503,," underlying local rules like Rule 56.1 is to obviate the need for the district court to search the record for facts relevant to summary 
judgment. Delange v. Dutra Constr., Co., 183 F.3d 916, 919 n.2 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). Such a policy has no impact on the 
scope of our appellate review. See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a) (stating that the record on appeal consists of all papers and exhibits

Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); Int'l Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S. Ct. 12, 
92 L. Ed. 20 (1947)). The Court in Fortner II recognized that the key question in establishing sufficient market power is whether 
the seller has some cost advantage not shared by its competitors which makes its competitors unable to provide the tying "
504,," product and that a mere showing that its competitors did not want to provide the tying product is insufficient to establish an illegal 
tie. Id. at 621-22. At the summary judgment stage, the evidence presented by McKenzie was sufficient to create a factual issue 
about whether McKenzie could not provide tertiary services or whether it was simply unwilling, as a matter of business strategy, 
to provide tertiary services."
504,30," If, on remand, McKenzie stakes its tying claim not on a theory that PeaceHealth explicitly (e.g., by contract)  [**90] or implicitly 
coerced insurers to purchase primary and secondary services from PeaceHealth as a condition to obtaining tertiary services, but 
on a theory that PeaceHealth's bundled discounts effectively left insurers with no rational economic choice other than purchasing 
tertiary services from PeaceHealth, such a claim might raise the question of whether, to establish the coercion element of a tying 
claim through a bundled discount, McKenzie must prove that PeaceHealth priced below a relevant measure of its costs. Some 
commentators would require a plaintiff alleging that a bundled discount amounts to an illegal tie to prove below-cost prices. See, 
e.g., 3 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 749b2 at 334 (Supp. 2006). It is unclear whether the AMC intended its three-part test to 
apply when a plaintiff alleging an illegal tying arrangement asserts that the defendant's pricing practices coerced unwanted 
purchases of the tied product. See AMC Report, supra, at 114 n.157 (""The recommended three-part test is proposed here for 
challenges to bundled pricing practices, and its purpose, as the text explains, is to avoid deterring procompetitive price 
reductions. The Commission is not recommending application  [**91] of this test outside the bundled pricing context, for example 
in tying or exclusive dealing cases. The Commission did not undertake to study tying and exclusive dealing issues more 
generally.""). The parties have not briefed this issue to us, and the parties did not raise the issue before the district court. We 
therefore leave it to the district court, if necessary, to decide the issue in the first instance on remand. Singleton v. Wulff, 428 
U.S. 106, 121, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 49 L. Ed. 2d 826 (1976). "
505,31," In No. 05-35627, we also decline to address McKenzie's Noerr-Pennington arguments because these related to an evidentiary 
ruling and the issue may not arise on a retrial. Further, we hold that the district court's jury instruction on combination or 
conspiracy was not an abuse of discretion. "
509,1," Defendants are: United Technologies  [**4] Corporation and Otis Elevator Company (collectively ""Otis""); Kone Corporation and 
Kone, Inc. (collectively ""Kone""); Schindler Holding Ltd. and Schindler Elevator Corporation (collectively ""Schindler""); 
ThyssenKrupp AG, ThyssenKrupp Elevator Corporation, and ThyssenKrupp Elevator Capital Corporation (collectively 
""Thyssen""). "
510,2," Counts III and IV are against Otis, V and VI, Kone; VII and VIII, Schindler; and IX and X, Thyssen."
510,3," A narrow view of Twombly would have limited its holding to the antitrust context, or perhaps only to Section 1 claims; but we 
have concluded that Twombly affects pleading standards somewhat more broadly. See Iqbal, 490 F.3d at 157 (""We are reluctant 
to assume that all of the language of Bell Atlantic[v. Twombly] applies only to section 1 allegations based on competitors' parallel 
conduct or, slightly more broadly, only to antitrust cases.""); ATSI Communs., Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, No. 05-5132, 
2007 WL 1989336, at *15 n.2 (2d Cir. July 11, 2007) (""We have declined to read Twombly's flexible 'plausibility standard' as 
relating only to antitrust cases."" (citing Iqbal, 490 F.3d 143, 2007 WL 1717803, at *11)). "
511,4," HN3[
] The potentially enormous cost of fact discovery was cited as a factor in Twombly; the Court explained that, while 
judges should ""be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery,"" they must also keep in mind that 
""proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive."" Id. at 1966-67. Accordingly,  [**8] district courts ""'retain the power to insist 
upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.'"" Id. at 1967 (quoting 
Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n.17, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983))."
511,5," Specifically, plaintiffs assert that, in order to effect the conspiracy, defendants: (a) Participated in meetings in the United States and Europe to discuss pricing and market divisions; (b) Agreed to fix prices for elevators and services; (c) Rigged bids for sales and maintenance; (d) Exchanged price quotes; (e) Allocated markets for sales and maintenance; (f) ""Collusively"" required customers to enter long-term maintenance contracts; and (g) Collectively took actions to drive independent repair companies out of business."
511,2, d Am. Compl. P 43. 
512,6," Plaintiffs allege: that the Italian Antitrust Authority and the European Commission have initiated investigations into possible 
wrongdoing by the defendants, 2d Am. Compl. PP 62-66; that the European Commission raided the offices of each defendant 
and issued a statement that it ""has good reason to believe that the manufacturers [including . . . Kone Corporation, Schindler 
Holding, and ThyssenKrupp AG] may have shared between themselves the tenders for sale & installation of elevators . . . and 
may have colluded to restrict competition with regard to after-sales services, 2d Am. Compl. P 66; that news reports claim that 
UTC and Kone Corporation have admitted wrongdoing by some of its European employees, 2d Am. Compl. PP 67-69; and that 
(subsequent to the filing of the complaint) extraordinary fines have been levied by the European Commission against defendants 
and their affiliates for various antitrust violations. [Pl. Ltr. Br. (June 6, 2007) at 3]."
512,7," Plaintiffs allege: that the ""effects [of defendants'  [**12] conspiracy] were felt by plaintiffs . . . in the United States,"" that ""the 
prices charged in the European market affect the prices in the United States and vice versa,"" and that pricing in Europe and the 
United States is ""intertwined."""
512,8," Because the pleadings do not state a claim, we need not consider the extra-territorial reach of the Sherman Act. See Hartford 
Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993) (""[T]he Sherman Act applies to foreign 
conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States.""). "
514,9," At argument in district court, an attorney for plaintiffs suggested that she knew of facts supporting more specific allegations of 
misconduct in the United States; but when pressed as to the substance of those facts, or for an explanation for why they don't 
appear in the complaint, she replied: ""Your honor, I really don't feel at liberty to [disclose the information]. It is confidential."" "
516,1," Consortium's third amended complaint used the terms ""affiliated"" and ""affiliate"" without definition. Those terms, liberally 
construed, refer to any reseller of Experian reports that obtains the reports directly from Experian. As we construe the complaint, 
the term ""affiliate"" is not limited to entities owned by or related to Experian. "
519,2," Experian argues the trade libel cause of action is inconsistent with the original complaint. Consortium's original complaint did 
not include a trade libel claim, but alleged that placing Consortium on the customer alert list ""constituted  [*15] a threat"" to 
entities with which Experian did business. The trade libel cause of action is not inconsistent with that allegation. Fairly read, the 
third amended complaint alleged Consortium's inclusion on the customer alert list constituted both a threat and trade 
disparagement. "
522,3," As explained ante, Consortium's Cartwright Act cause of action did not allege an indirect or ""secondary"" boycott. "
603,1," See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45727, 2006 WL 
2038650 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2006) (appointing co-lead counsel). "
605,2," The summary version — which was published in eight separate publications, over the PR Newswire twice, in relevant trade 
association publications, and on the Internet from September 9, 2002 through October 14, 2002 — included the following 
warning: ""If you or your company have accepted MasterCard and/or Visa cards for payment at any time since October 1992, this 
Notice may affect your rights."" Visa Check Notice Order Ex. H (boldface highlighting and capitalization removed)."
605,3," The Visa Check class entered into substantially identical settlement agreements with each network. See DE 387 (reprinting 
each). For ease of reference, I refer to them collectively as the ""Settlement"" and cite exclusively to the agreement executed by 
Visa. "
606,4," In some circumstances, a single bank can act as both the Issuing Bank and the Acquiring Bank for the same transaction; the 
interchange fee is nevertheless charged in such transactions. "
607,5," The Settlement provided for a five-month decrease in the interchange fee for debit transactions using Visa and MasterCard 
products, but said nothing about interchange fees for credit transactions. Thus the dispute here centers on whether  [*232] the 
latter fact was contemplated by all parties, or was an oversight by the class plaintiffs' erstwhile counsel that left room for the 
defendants to take an action that was arguably entirely inconsistent with the Settlement's spirit. "
608,6," The instant motion was briefed and argued before Twombly was decided. No party has suggested that either the latter decision 
or the cases in this Circuit interpreting it, such as Iqbal and In re Elevator Antitrust Litigation, alter the analysis or the outcome 
that should obtain here. "
609,7," The relevant items in the docket of that litigation, CV 96-5238, were the following: DE 1 (Complaint); DE 24 (First Amended 
Consolidated Class Action Complaint); DE 25 (Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint); DE 164 (Third 
Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint);  [*239] DE 811 (Settlement Agreement as to MasterCard); DE 812 (Settlement 
Agreement as to Visa)."
609,8," The Class Plaintiffs have submitted a declaration that sets forth allegations and discusses the exhibits annexed to it, which 
include: discovery materials from this litigation, an article published on the ""American Banker Online"" web site, and assorted 
documents previously publicly filed on the Visa Check docket. DE 454."
609,9," The exception, of course, is those members of the plaintiff class here who opted out of the Visa Check litigation and thus are 
not bound by the Settlement; their claims for damages incurred prior to 2004 are not affected by this motion. "
612,10," As a technical matter, the court could simply disregard this aspect of the Class Plaintiffs' argument because it relies on factual 
assertions outside the Complaint. I nevertheless urge the court to dispose of the argument on the merits to avoid the piecemeal 
litigation that might otherwise result. Under the liberal amendment regime of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), the only reason the Class 
Plaintiffs would be denied leave to amend their Complaint to add allegations supporting a theory of fraudulent inducement would 
be a finding that the amendment would be futile (I offer no view as to whether such allegations would be likely to satisfy the "
613,," flexible plausibility standard required under Twombly). Such a futility inquiry would merely replicate the analysis I present here. I 
therefore conclude that the interest of judicial economy is served by addressing the issue now. "
615,11," In attacking the Notice as under-inclusive, the Class Plaintiffs take issue with the sentence that immediately precedes the one 
just quoted (a sentence that describes the Visa Check complaint's allegation of an unlawful tying arrangement) but elides any 
reference to the allegations about excessive fees. Opp'n at 21; Visa Check Notice ¶ 3. The omission is troubling, but has no 
bearing on my analysis, which takes into account the record rather than merely the parties' selections from it. "
617,1," U.S. Patent Nos. 6,574,267; 6,169,759 (""the '759 patent); and 6,301,286 (""the '286 patent). The '759 and '286 patents relate to 
the CPCH technology at issue."
617,2," Association of Radio Industries and Businesses, European Telecommunication Standard Institute, T1 (replaced by Alliance for 
Telecommunications Industry Solutions in April 2004), Telecommunications Technology Association, and Telecommunications 
Technology Committee. China Wireless Telecommunications Standard Group joined as an Organizational Member in May 1999."
617,3," A company registered as a member of an Organizational Partner and able to participate in an Organizational Partner's 
technical work can become an Individual Member of 3GPP. "
618,4," Telecommunications manufacturers that implemented CPCH were not required by law to follow 3GPP standards. However, if a 
manufacturer implemented CPCH it would need to follow 3GPP standards to ensure that its equipment was compatible with 
other telecommunications  [*7] equipment and networks. "
623,5," Samsung apparently paid GBT an up  [*25] front fee of $ 100,000, but did not pay any royalties based on usage. "
624,6," The Court encourages the parties to review its recent opinions in Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. v. M-I, LLC, 244 F.R.D. 369, 
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44690 (E.D. Tex. June 20, 2007) (Davis, J.) (currently available at 2007 WL 1765642) and Maurice 
Mitchell Innovations, L.P. v. Intel Corp., 491 F. Supp. 2d 684 (E.D. Tex. June 20, 2007) (Davis, J.) regarding bills of costs. If, 
after reviewing the law as stated in those orders, there is any area of disagreement related to Defendants' Bills of Costs, the 
parties should meet, confer, and be prepared to compromise making every effort to submit an ""agreed"" bill of costs to the Court. "
631,1," Under California law, the interference with ""business expectancy"" and interference with ""prospective economic advantage"" 
refer to the same tort. Cf. JRS Products, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of America, 115 Cal. App. 4th 168, 180, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
840); Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 11 Cal. 4th 376, 378, 45 Cal. Rptr. 2d 436, 902 P.2d 740 (1995) 
(describing various names for torts characterized by interfering with a business relationship that has not yet settled into  [**6] a 
contract). The parties use-both terms in their papers, and the Court will use the terms interchangeably in this order. "
635,2," MPT also argues that Gateway did not file a timely opposition to this motion. Since Gateway filed a notice of joinder to Dell's 
opposition one day after these papers were due, however, the Court exercises its discretion to accept Gateway's opposition as 
set forth in Dell's argument. "
636,3," In this section, the Court will refer to ""Lucent's"" motions, but the same rationale applies to the extent that MPT has joined the 
motion against Gateway. "
649,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes illegal any ""contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
651,2," In In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24 (2d Cir. 2006), decided after the district court's ruling, we perceived ""a 
major shift away from the . . . 'not fatally flawed' language of . . . Visa Check."" Id. at 37. ""[W]e can no longer continue to advise 
district courts that . . . an expert's report will sustain a plaintiff's burden so long as it is not 'fatally flawed . . . .'"" Id. at 40. The use 
of the phrase by the district court does not affect our analysis, however, and we therefore do not address it further."
651,3," Cordes and Creditors Trust contended, as they do on appeal, that when faced with allegations of a horizontal price-fixing 
conspiracy, we should presume that the entire class suffered antitrust injury. We need not evaluate that argument in order to 
resolve the merits of this appeal, and therefore express no view as to it. "
652,4," The trustee of an estate in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 is required to ""collect and reduce to money the property of the estate . . 
. and close such estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties in interest."" 11 U.S.C. § 704(a)(1). 
""Under 11 U.S.C. § 541, the rights of action of the debtor pass to the estate created by the commencement of the bankruptcy 
proceeding . . . ."" Mitchell Excavators, Inc. by Mitchell v. Mitchell, 734 F.2d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1984). The trustee may ""reduce to 
money"" the ""rights of action of the debtor"" by litigating them on behalf of the estate, or, as the defendants concede, by assigning 
the rights of action to third parties. See Def. Br. at 23; see also Integrated Solutions, Inc. v. Serv. Support Specialties, Inc., 124 "
653,," F.3d 487, 493-95 (3d Cir. 1997) (recognizing that property in the  [**22] bankrupt's estate is alienable insofar as it would have 
been alienable outside the bankruptcy context)."
653,5," As the defendants put it in their brief: The district court did not suggest that [Cordes, as] an owner of a claim by assignment[,] does not possess a right to bring 
suit individually to recover the proceeds of [its] claim. Nor do plaintiffs contend that the district court's order bars them from 
proceeding individually or receiving the proceeds to which their assignors would be entitled should there be a class 
recovery. Thus, the district court did not affect any substantive right to recovery that they acquired by assignment. Def. Br. at 23 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original)."
653,6," Several doctrines  [**24] ""'cluster about Article III -- not only standing but mootness, ripeness, political question, and the like . . . 
.'"" Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984) (quoting Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 226 U.S. App. 
D.C. 14, 699 F.2d 1166, 1178-79 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Article III standing, which is ""perhaps the most important of these doctrines,"" 
id., requires, at an ""irreducible constitutional minimum,"" that the plaintiff suffered injury-in-fact, ""fairly traceable"" to the 
defendant's acts, and redressable by a decision in the plaintiff's favor, in order for a federal court to address the dispute, Lujan v. 
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted)."
653,7," In some circumstances, requiring class representatives to be members of the class may also ensure that the litigation complies 
with Article III limits on federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court referred to a possible connection between standing to represent 
a class, Rule 23(a), and Article III standing in Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U.S. 119, 131 n.12, 97 S. Ct. 1709, 52 L. Ed. 2d 184 
(1977). See also O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S. Ct. 669, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1974) (""[I]f none of the named plaintiffs 
purporting to represent a class establishes the requisite of a case or controversy  [**25] with the defendants, none may seek 
relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class."" (citing, inter alia, Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 32-33, 82 S. Ct. 
549, 7 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1962))); Lynch v. Baxley, 744 F.2d 1452, 1456 (11th Cir. 1984) (""If the named plaintiff seeking to represent 
a class fails to establish the requisite case or controversy, he may not seek relief on his behalf or on that of the class."" (citing 
O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 494)); DuPree v. United States, 559 F.2d 1151, 1153 (9th Cir. 1977) (""When the suit takes the form of a 
class action, Article III requires that the representative or named plaintiff must share the same injury . . . ."" (citing Warth, 422 
U.S. at 502)). "
655,8,"  Commentators have traced the doctrine of champerty, and its doctrinal near-cousins of maintenance and barratry, back to 
Greek and Roman law, through the English law of the Middle Ages, and into the statutory or common law of many of the 
states. See generally, Susan Lorde Martin, Syndicated Lawsuits: Illegal Champerty or New Business Opportunity?, 30 Am. 
Bus. L.J. 485, 486-89 (1992); Max Radin, Maintenance by Champerty, 24 Cal. L. Rev. 48, 48-66 (1936). Elliott Assocs., L.P. v. Banco de la Nacion, 194 F.3d 363, 372 (2d Cir. 1999). Champerty, a tort governed largely by state law, 
has been narrowed to focus on the prevention of litigation by lawyers for the primary purpose of recovering their costs and fees. 
See, e.g., id. at 374 (recognizing that the object of New York's champerty statute is ""'to prevent attorneys, etc., from purchasing 
things in action for the purpose of obtaining costs by the prosecution thereof, and it was not intended to prevent a purchase for 
the purpose of protecting some other right of the assignee'"" (quoting Moses v. McDivitt, 88 N.Y. 62, 65 (1882))."
655,9," Of course, if the district court certifies the class after a determination that either or both of the plaintiffs are adequate class 
representatives, it can always alter, or indeed revoke, class certification at any time before final judgment is entered should a 
change in circumstances render the plaintiffs inadequate class representatives. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1); see also Visa Check, 
280 F.3d at 141 (recognizing a district court's ability to modify a class certification order or decertify a class if it becomes 
necessary to do so). "
656,10," Rule 23(b)(3) provides: HN10[
] An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of [Rule 23](a) are satisfied, and in addition: . . . (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions 
affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient 
adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in 
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning 
the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of 
concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties  [**36] likely to be encountered in the 
management of a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). "
658,11," It is conceivable that one could create a common formula for determining whether the but-for fee was higher or lower than the 
fee paid, but would need to conduct individualized inquiries to determine the extent of the spread between the two fees. But the 
experts before us would each use one approach (the plaintiffs' expert a common one and the defendants' expert an 
individualized one) to answer both the injury-in-fact question -- that is, whether a plaintiff was harmed -- and the damages 
question -- that is, by how much a plaintiff was harmed."
658,12," The issue is not only common, but appears to be readily resolved. The defendants were asked at oral argument: ""[I]f there is 
injury, assuming the conspiracy, . . . it is antitrust injury. Isn't that right?"" The defendants responded, ""It's of the type that's 
antitrust injury. That's correct, your Honor."" Oral Arg. Tr. at 19:16-20 (Mar. 19, 2007). As far as we can tell, the concession was 
warranted. See New York v. Hendrickson Bros., Inc., 840 F.2d 1065, 1079 (2d Cir. 1988) (recognizing that ""[i]n general, the 
person who has purchased directly from those who have fixed prices at an artificially high level in violation of the antitrust laws is 
deemed to have suffered . . . antitrust injury""). Of course, not every injury caused by a per se violation of the antitrust laws is 
antitrust injury and even a plaintiff alleging a per se violation must demonstrate that his injury amounts to antitrust injury. See Atl. 
Richfield, 495 U.S. at 341 (rejecting ""respondent's  [**45] suggestion that no antitrust injury need be shown where a per se 
violation is involved""). But the defendants have never contended that overcharges paid to a horizontal price-fixing cartel are not 
antitrust injuries; nor would any such contention be persuasive in this case. "
659,13," ""[T]he determination as to a Rule 23 requirement is made only for purposes of class certification and is not binding on the trier 
of facts, even if that trier is the class certification judge."" IPO Securities, 471 F.3d at 41.  [**46]"
659,14," The related damages question is: if so, how much more. "
660,15," We also leave to the district court to determine whether the issue of damages -- which here may be resolved using the same 
evidence as that presented for injury-in-fact -- is a common question or requires individual determinations, and whether class 
certification is appropriate on the question of damages. "
662,1," The combined form of Hypertherm's motion is arguably in violation of Local Rule 7.1(a)(1). The combination of the two motions 
complicated the task of addressing the issues raised. ATTC did not object on that basis, however, and the court will not strike 
the motion sua sponte after the parties have addressed the issues in both contexts. "
663,2," A reply in support of a dispositive motion is limited to rebuttal of factual and legal arguments raised in the objection. LR 
7.1(e)(1). The moving party cannot raise new arguments and issues in a reply that it failed to address in the original motion. See 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 922 n.7 (1st 
Cir. 1993). "
665,3," ATTC's stubborn reliance on its law of the case theory and arguments made in its previous filings undermine its position and 
have required the court to forage back to previously-filed documents to find ATTC's references. In the future, ATTC would be 
well advised to include all pertinent and material matters in the filings under consideration. "
666,4," ATTC relies on Advance Bus. Sys. & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 64 (4th Cir. 1969), as authority for the proposition 
that threats are sufficient to support an illegal tying arrangement. Advance Bus. Sys., however, involved an allegedly illegal tying 
arrangement between a service contract and supplies for leased copiers, where the service contract was one of the tied 
products. Here, Hypertherm provided the warranty with the cutting system, not as a separately purchased plan. In addition, to 
the extent Advance Bus. Sys. supports a theory that threats are  [*18] sufficient to support a tying claim, the First Circuit's 
opinion in Borschow, which more recently held that mere threats are not enough to show an illegal tie, is binding in this case. Id. 
at 17. "
667,5," Although ATTC included allegations about Hypertherm's share of the replacement parts market, the parties appear to agree 
that in this case the relevant market is for cutting systems and not the derivative market for replacement parts. Cf. SMS Sys., 
188 F.3d at 17 (addressing issue of whether foremarket or aftermarket was relevant for determining market power)."
667,6," ATTC cites paragraphs 34 and 39 which do not contain the allegations represented. Review of the counterclaim shows that

its three mountains or higher priced individual daily tickets that would permit the consumer to ski all four mountains. The plan 
worked, and when the owner of the three mountains prevented any attempt by Highlands to sell four-mountain multi-packs (by,

provide the State commission all relevant documentation concerning-- (i) the unresolved issues; (ii) the position of each of the parties with respect to those issues; and (iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the parties. (B) A party petitioning a State commission under paragraph (1) shall provide a copy of the petition and any documentation 
to the other party or parties not later than the day on which the State commission receives the petition. (3) Opportunity to respond. A non-petitioning party to a negotiation under this section may respond to the other party's 
petition and provide such additional information as it wishes within 25 days after the State commission receives the petition. (4) Action by State commission. (A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the 
issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any, filed under paragraph (3). (B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such information as may be 
necessary for the State commission to reach  [*14] a decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails 
unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State commission, then the State 
commission may proceed on the basis of the best information available to it from whatever source derived. (C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing 
appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the 
resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which the local exchange carrier received the 
request under this section. (5) Refusal to negotiate. The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to 
cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in

commission shall not consider  [*16] the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable 
unless-- "
692,," (i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the 
transport and termination on each carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other 
carrier; and (ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of 
terminating such calls. (B) Rules of construction. This paragraph shall not be construed-- (i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal obligations, 
including arrangements that waive mutual recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or (ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with 
particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to 
the additional costs of such calls. (3) Wholesale prices for telecommunications services. For the purposes of section 251(c)(4), a State commission shall

by the local exchange carrier. (e) Approval by State commission. (1) Approval required. Any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval 
to the State commission. A State commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement, 
with written findings as to any deficiencies. (2) Grounds for rejection. The State commission may only reject-- (A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) if it finds that-- (i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement; or (ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity; 
or (B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) if it finds that the agreement does not 
meet the requirements of section 251, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission  [*18] pursuant to section 
251, or the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section. (3) Preservation of authority. Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253, nothing in this section shall prohibit 
a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement, including 
requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements. (4) Schedule for decision. If the State commission does not act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after 
submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by negotiation under subsection (a), or within 30 days after submission 
by the parties of an agreement adopted by arbitration under subsection (b), the agreement shall be deemed approved. No 
State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under 
this section. (5) Commission to act if State will not act. If a State commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section 
in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting the State 
commission's jurisdiction  [*19] of that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice) of such 
failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the State commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or 
matter and act for the State commission. (6) Review of State commission actions. In a case in which a State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the 
proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the 
exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a determination 
under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to 
determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 and this section. (f) Statements of generally available terms. "

review of such statement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or 
requirements. (3) Schedule for review. The State commission to which a statement is submitted shall, not later than 60 days after the date

statement that has been permitted to take effect under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving or 
disapproving such statement under paragraph (2). (5) Duty to negotiate not affected. The submission or approval of a statement under  [*21] this subsection shall not relieve a 
Bell operating company of its duty to negotiate the terms and conditions of an agreement under section 251. (g) Consolidation of State proceedings. Where not inconsistent with the requirements of this Act, a State commission may, 
to the extent practical, consolidate proceedings under sections 214(e), 251(f), 253, and this section in order to reduce 
administrative burdens on telecommunications carriers, other parties to the proceedings, and the State commission in 
carrying out its responsibilities under this Act. (h) Filing required. A State commission shall make a copy of each agreement approved under subsection (e) and each 
statement approved under subsection (f) available for public inspection and copying within 10 days after the agreement or

concerning failures by Bell operating companies to meet conditions required for approval under paragraph (3). Unless the 
parties otherwise agree, the Commission shall act on such complaint within 90 days. (e) Limitations. (1) Joint marketing of local and long distance services. Until a Bell operating company is authorized pursuant to subsection 
(d) to provide interLATA services in an in-region State, or until 36 months have passed since the date of enactment of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 [enacted Feb. 8, 1996], whichever is earlier, a telecommunications carrier that serves 
greater than 5 percent of the Nation's presubscribed access lines may not jointly market in such State telephone exchange 
service obtained from such company pursuant to section 251(c)(4) with interLATA services offered by that 
telecommunications carrier. (2) IntraLATA toll dialing parity. (A) Provision required. A Bell operating company granted authority to provide interLATA services under subsection (d) shall 
provide intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout that State coincident with its exercise of that authority. (B) Limitation. Except for  [*33] single-LATA States and States that have issued an order by December 19, 1995, requiring 
a Bell operating company to implement intraLATA toll dialing parity, a State may not require a Bell operating company to 
implement intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State before a Bell operating company has been granted authority under this 
section to provide interLATA services originating in that State or before 3 years after the date of enactment of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 [enacted Feb. 8, 1996], whichever is earlier. Nothing in this subparagraph precludes a 
State from issuing an order requiring intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State prior to either such date so long as such order 
does not take effect until after the earlier of either such dates. "
697,," (f) Exception for previously authorized activities. Neither subsection (a) nor section 273 shall prohibit a Bell operating 
company or affiliate from engaging, at any time after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 
[enacted Feb. 8, 1996], in any activity to the extent authorized by, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in, an 
order entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  [*34] pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of the 
AT&T Consent Decree if such order was entered on or before such date of enactment, to the extent such order is not 
reversed or vacated on appeal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit, or to impose terms or conditions on, 
an activity in which a Bell operating company is otherwise authorized to engage under any other provision of this section. (g) ""Incidental interLATA services"" defined. For purposes of this section, the term ""incidental interLATA services"" means the 
interLATA provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate-- (1) (A) of audio programming, video programming, or other programming services to subscribers to such services of such 
company or affiliate; (B) of the capability for interaction by such subscribers to select or respond to such audio programming, video 
programming, or other programming services; (C) to distributors of audio programming or video programming that such company or affiliate owns or controls, or is 
licensed by the copyright owner of such programming (or by an assignee of such owner) to distribute; or (D) of alarm monitoring services; (2) of two-way interactive video services or Internet services  [*35] over dedicated facilities to or for elementary and 
secondary schools as defined in section 254(h)(5); (3) of commercial mobile services in accordance with section 332(c) of this Act and with the regulations prescribed by the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph (8) of such section; (4) of a service that permits a customer that is located in one LATA to retrieve stored information from, or file information for 
storage in, information storage facilities of such company that are located in another LATA; (5) of signaling information used in connection with the provision of telephone exchange services or exchange access by a 
local exchange carrier; or (6) of network control signaling information to, and receipt of such signaling information from, common carriers offering 
interLATA services at any location within the area in which such Bell operating company provides telephone exchange 
services or exchange access. (h) Limitations. The provisions of subsection (g) are intended to be narrowly construed. The interLATA services provided 
under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (g)(1) are limited to those interLATA transmissions incidental to the 
provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate  [*36] of video, audio, and other programming services that the 
company or its affiliate is engaged in providing to the public. The Commission shall ensure that the provision of services 
authorized under subsection (g) by a Bell operating company or its affiliate will not adversely affect telephone exchange 
service ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market. (i) Additional definitions. As used in this section-- (1) In-region State. The term ""in-region State"" means a State in which a Bell operating company or any of its affiliates was 
authorized to provide wireline telephone exchange service pursuant to the reorganization plan approved under the AT&T 
Consent Decree, as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [enacted Feb. 
8, 1996]. (2) Audio programming services. The term ""audio programming services"" means programming provided by, or generally 
considered to be comparable to programming provided by, a radio broadcast station. (3) Video programming services; other programming services. The terms ""video programming service"" and ""other 
programming services"" have the same meanings as such terms have under section 602 of this Act. (j) Certain  [*37] service applications treated as in-region service applications. For purposes of this section, a Bell operating 
company application to provide 800 service, private line service, or their equivalents that-- (1) terminate in an in-region State of that Bell operating company, and "
698,," (2) allow the called party to determine the interLATA carrier, shall be considered an in-region service subject to the 
requirements of subsection (b)(1)."
698,6," The Court, in granting a permanent injunction against enforcement of the PSC orders, held that the PSC orders mandating that 
BellSouth continue to provide switching, loops, and transport services for new orders to CLECs were pre-empted because they 
were inconsistent with the FCC's Order on Remand. However, the Court stated specifically that it was ""not making a finding as to 
whether BellSouth has additional unbundling requirements pursuant to § 271."" The Court explained that, ""[i]n the Court's Opinion 
granting preliminary relief, the Court noted that this Court was not the appropriate forum to address this issue because the FCC 
was the appropriate forum. This statement was dictum and was only addressed because the Defendants  [*40] argued that § 
271 prevented the Court's entry of a preliminary injunction. As the Court is merely concluding that the PSC orders are pre-
empted by the Order on Remand, the Court makes no finding as to § 271 requirements."" "

710,6," Section 206(a) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a), addresses FERC's ability to fix rates and charges and to determine the cost of 
production or transmission. Section 206(a) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a), in relevant part, provides: Whenever [FERC], after a hearing held upon its own motion or upon complaint, [finds] that any rate, charge, or 
classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the 
jurisdiction of [FERC], or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, 
unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, [FERC must] determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, 
classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be  [*18] thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by 
order."
710,7," Section 201(f) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824(f), provides that no provision  [*19] in the FPA applies to an electric cooperative that

711,8," Section 201(a) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824(a), provides for federal regulation of ""the transmission of electric energy in 
interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce."" Section 201(b) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 
824(b), indicates that the FPA applies to ""the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric 
energy at wholesale in interstate commerce."""
711,9," Two subsections are pertinent here. Section 205(a) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a),  [*23] provides: All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of 
electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of [FERC], and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or 
charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be 
unlawful. And, section 205(c) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(c), requires public utilities to file with [FERC] schedules showing all rates and charges for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of [FERC], 
and the classifications, practices and regulations affecting such rates and charges, together with all contracts which in any 
manner affect or relate to such rates, charges, classifications, and services. "
713,10," In light of its conclusion regarding field preemption, the court need not address the question of conflict preemption. 
Nonetheless, the court notes that CIPCO's claims appear to impermissibly thwart Congress' objective to vest with FERC 
exclusive jurisdiction over the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce. Schneidewind, 485 
U.S. at 300 (stating that conflict preemption bars any state law action which ""stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the 
full purposes and objectives of Congress""); cf. Public Utility Dist. No. 1 v. IDACORP Inc., 379 F.3d 641, 649-50 (9th Cir. 2004)

736,7," 15 U.S.C. § 3431(a)(1)(A) provides: For purposes of section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. § 717 (b)], the provisions of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C.§ 
717 et seq.], and the jurisdiction of the Commission under such Act shall not apply to any natural gas solely by reason of 
any first sale of such natural gas."
736,8," 15 U.S.C. § 3301(21) defines ""first sale"" as follows: (A) General rule The term ""first sale"" means any sale of any volume of natural gas-- (i) to any interstate pipeline or intrastate pipeline; (ii) to any local distribution company; (iii) to any person for use by such person; (iv) which precedes any sale described in clauses  [**22] (i), (ii), or (iii); and (v) which precedes or follows any sale described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) and is defined by the Commission as a 
first sale in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this chapter. (B) Certain sales not included Clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall not include the sale of any volume of natural gas by any interstate 
pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any affiliate thereof, unless such sale is attributable to volumes 
of natural gas produced by such interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any affiliate thereof."
736,9," 15 U.S.C. § 717b(b) provides: With respect to natural gas which is imported into the United States from a nation with which there is in effect a free trade 
agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, and with respect to liquefied natural gas-- (1) the importation of such natural gas shall be treated as a ""first sale"" within the meaning of section 3301(21) of this title;

unreasonable, unduly  [**23] discriminatory, or preferential basis."
737,10," Interstate pipelines already had blanket market certificates under FERC Order 636. See 57 Fed. Reg. at 13,270. "
738,11," To clarify, there are two different types of challenges to FERC-authorized rates. In a number of cases, such as this one, a 
buyer brings a state law or federal antitrust action against a seller, who in turn raises the Filed Rate Doctrine as an affirmative 
defense. See e.g., Grays Harbor, 379 F.3d 641; Snohomish, 384 F.3d 756. In the context of such collateral challenges to FERC-
authorized rates, we do not consider whether the FERC-authorized rates are just and reasonable. Rather, under the principles of 
the Filed Rate Doctrine, they are just and reasonable as a matter of law. In the case of market-based rates, although we have 
considered whether FERC exercised its authority to set rates, we have not considered whether FERC erred in determining that 
market-based rates  [**29] were just and reasonable. See Grays Harbor, 379 F.3d at 651-52; Snohomish, 384 F.3d at 760. We have also considered challenges to FERC-authorized rates that arise in a different context, namely, where a party directly 
challenges a FERC decision implementing its rate-setting authority. See e.g., Cal. ex rel. Lockyer, 383 F.3d 1006; see also 
Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County Washington v. FERC (""PUD of Snohomish""), 471 F.3d 1053, 1082-84 (9th Cir. 
2006). Parties claiming that FERC has not fulfilled its statutory obligation to ensure just and reasonable rates must present this 
issue to FERC in the first instance. We may review FERC's determination on appeal. 15 U.S.C. § 717r; 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b). 
Unlike the collateral challenges described above, such direct challenges do require us to determine whether FERC has properly 
exercised its rate-making authority. In direct appeals of FERC decisions to authorize market-based rates, we have considered 
whether ""approval of such tariffs was conditioned on the existence of a competitive market."" Cal. ex rel. Lockyer, 383 F.3d at 
1013. We thought it relevant that FERC approved market-based rates only after finding that the seller did  [**30] not have, or 
had adequately mitigated, market power and that FERC required seller to file periodic reports summarizing its transactions. Id. 
This second type of challenge is not before us today, and we do not reach the question whether FERC's implementation of its 
ratemaking authority in the natural gas arena complied with its statutory obligations under the NGA. "
740,12," We reject Gallo's arguments that footnotes 5 and 14 in Arkla represent the Supreme Court's conclusion that the Filed Rate 
Doctrine applies only to rates actually filed with FERC. In footnote 5, the Supreme Court noted FERC's determination that the 
filed rate doctrine did not apply to gas producers after 1972, because after that date, the gas producers became ""small 
producers,"" who were no longer required to file a rate with FERC. 453 U.S. at 576 n.5. The Court further stated that FERCs 
""small producer"" finding ""is not before us, and we do not believe that the state courts erred in deferring to that finding."" Id. at n. 5. 
In footnote 14, the Court stated: ""There is no bar to damages for the period after respondents gained 'small producer' status. 
See n. 5, supra."" Id. at 584 n.14. Gallo puts too much weight on these brief explanatory asides. The Supreme Court does not 
explain the reason there was no bar to damages after the gas  [**38] producers became small producers, and the Court may 
simply have deferred to FERCs then-current position on the issue. Accordingly, these footnotes do not control the issue before 
us. "
742,13," We do not address the question whether a plaintiff could potentially develop a methodology to challenge its retail rates without 
challenging authorized rates. Certain district courts that previously addressed this appeared to assume that, for all practical 
purposes, the indices reflect FERC-authorized rates. See e.g., In re Western States Wholesale Natural Gas Antitrust Litig. 
(Abelman Art Glass), 408 F. Supp. 2d 1055 (D.Nev. 2005); In re Western States Wholesale Natural Gas Antitrust Litig. (Texas-
Ohio), 368 F. Supp. 2d 1110 (D. Nev. 2005); Sierra Pac. Resources, Inc. v. El Paso Co., No. CV-S-03-0414-JCM-RJJ  [**45] (D. 
Nev. Dec. 8, 2004). This practical conclusion may turn out to be factually correct in this case: for example, if the number of non-
FERC-authorized rates included in the indices was de minimis compared to the number of FERC-authorized rates, the impact of 
any manipulation of the non-FERC-authorized rates may have had a de minimis impact on the rates paid by Gallo. Similarly, it 
may not be possible to link EnCana to any damages experienced by Gallo due to manipulation of non-FERC-authorized rates. 
However, given the state of this record, we cannot resolve these factual issues on summary judgment. Gallo is entitled to an 
opportunity to develop these issues and to prove its damages. "
743,14," EnCana argues that the Filed Rate Doctrine bars claims based on first sales because some of the natural gas in sales at issue 
in County of Stanislaus was imported from Canada and those sales would have been first sales under the NGPA. County of 
Stanislaus did not expressly address this issue, and ""[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention 
of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having [been] so decided as to constitute precedents."" In re Larry's 
Apartment, L.L.C., 249 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir. 2001) (alternation in original) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S. 
Ct. 148, 69 L. Ed. 411 (1925)). "
745,15," We also reject the related argument that because wholesale market rates are often derived from the indices, the Filed Rate 
Doctrine bars damage claims based on all rates reported in the indices. We are aware of no basis  [**57] for holding that the 
Filed Rate Doctrine bars claims based on a reference point for pricing transactions (be it a trade index, the Consumer Price 
Index, or the New York Stock Exchange) that is not itself a FERC-approved rate. "
746,1," A provocative article in the New York Times, September 4, 2007, compares electricity rates of states that regulate and those

761,3," Plaintiffs claim that in April 1992, Monsanto entered into an agreement with a competing seed manufacturer, Defendant 
Pioneer, to insert Monsanto's Roundup Ready(R) genes into five of its soybean varietal seed lines. Plaintiffs claim that in return, 
Defendant Pioneer agreed to promote only Roundup(R) herbicide for use with Roundup Ready(R) soybeans, and to produce 
and sell unlimited units of Pioneer soybeans containing the Roundup Ready(R) trait. Plaintiffs claim that at or about the same 
time, Monsanto entered into a parallel agreement with Novartis (nka Syngenta). Id. at P 71. Plaintiffs further claim that between 1992 and 1996, Monsanto entered into license agreements with various seed 
manufacturers, including Pioneer and Novartis, granting those companies licensed access to Monsanto's GM Bt corn seed 
technology. Plaintiff claims that, similar to the 1992 agreements, the license agreements allowed Pioneer and Novartis, in 
exchange for a flat, up-front payment to Monsanto, to incorporate Monsanto's Bt corn  [**7] traits into their seed lines. Id. at P 72."
761,4," Plaintiffs claim that from the time of Monsanto's institution of the technology fee, through the 2001 crop year, the technology fee 
appeared as a separate, line-item invoiced listing on farmers' seed bills. Id. at P 80. Beginning in the 2002 crop year, however, 
Plaintiffs claim Monsanto ordered its licensees to discontinue the practice of invoicing the technology fee as a separate line-item. 
Id. at PP 80-81. Plaintiffs claim that Monsanto now penalizes companies if they separately list the technology fee on their seed "
762,," invoices, by, among other things, reducing the upstream technology fee payment split, in which Plaintiffs  [**9] claim Monsanto 
engages with the seed manufacturers. Id. at P 81. "

764,7, Counts 5-25 are brought by the respective Statewide Classes. 
767,8," In the Motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred and therefore should be dismissed. According to 
Defendants, the following cases contain similar allegations to those asserted here: Higginbotham v. Monsanto Co., No. 
1:99CV03337, (D.D.C., December 14, 1999); Blades v. Monsanto Co., No. 00-CV-4034, (S.D. Ill. February 14, 2000); and 
Sample v. Monsanto Co., No. 4:01-CV-00065,  [**24] (E.D. Mo., February 14, 2000) (collectively, ""McIntosh""). Defendants argue 
that the claims in this consolidated action accrued - at the latest - by December 1999, because the first McIntosh case should 
have alerted Plaintiffs to their injuries. Defendants maintain therefore, that Plaintiffs' March, 2004, filing of this action is outside 
the four year statute of limitations period, applicable to antitrust claims. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 401 U.S. 
321, 338, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971) (internal quotations omitted) (HN4[
] ""Damages are recoverable under the federal antitrust acts only if suit therefor is commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued, under 15 U.S.C.S. § 
15(b), plus any additional number of years during which the statute of limitations was tolled.""). Plaintiffs counter that if, as Defendants contend, the McIntosh cases contain allegations similar to those asserted here, the 
motion for class certification filed in Sample, tolled the running of the statute of limitations, at least, through the court's 
September 23, 2003, denial of the motion. Plaintiffs point out that the proposed class members in Sample are the same parties 
that have filed suit here and therefore,  [**25] the action before this Court is timely. In American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974), the Supreme Court held that HN5[ ] the filing of a putative class action ""tolls the running of the statute for all purported members of the class who make timely 
motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status."" Id. at 553. The Court concludes that 
the American Pipe tolling rule is appropriate in this case. The proposed classes in the motion for class certification in Sample 
were all persons and entities who purchased Roundup Ready(r) soybean seeds in the United States and all persons and entities 
who purchased Yieldgard(r) corn seeds in the United States. Plaintiffs' here were within the class sought in Sample. Thus, the 
statute of limitations period was tolled on their claims, while the Sample court determined whether to allow the case to proceed 
as a class action. Defendants' reliance on Basch v. Ground Round, Inc., 139 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998), in support of the proposition that Plaintiffs' 
claims were not tolled because American Pipe does not extend to subsequent class actions, is misplaced. In Basch, the court 
ruled that Plaintiffs were not  [**26] permitted to toll the statute of limitations by filing successive putative class actions, alleging 
similar classes and similar claims. Id. at 11; see also Korwek v. Hunt, 827 F.2d 874, 879 (2nd Cir. 1987) (""The Supreme Court in 
American Pipe … certainly did not intend to afford plaintiffs the opportunity to argue and reargue the question of class 
certification by filing new but repetitive complaints.""). Here, Plaintiffs have not attempted to file a successive class action by 
members of the original asserted class nor seek to relitigate the propriety of a previously rejected class. Therefore, the Court 
concludes that Basch and Korwek are distinguishable and Plaintiffs' claims are not time-barred. "

traits. For example, this license term prevented licensees from utilizing other genetically-modified seed technologies in 
combination with Roundup Ready(r) or YieldGard(r). Such prohibitions have raised the barriers to entry to the market for 
genetically modified seed products, thereby further reducing competition in those markets."" Pls.' Compl. at P 96. "
769,11," The Court relied on three rationales in adopting the indirect purchaser rule: 1) establishing the amount of an overcharge 
shifted to indirect purchasers would normally prove insurmountable in light of the wide range of considerations influencing a 
company's pricing decisions; 2) a pass-on defense would reduce the effectiveness of § 4 actions by diminishing the recovery 
available to any potential plaintiff; and 3) allowing suits by indirect purchasers would risk multiple liability because the alleged 
antitrust violators could not use a pass-on defense in an action by the direct purchasers. Kansas v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 
U.S. 199, 206-08, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990). HN7[
] The Supreme Court has applied  [**34] the indirect purchaser rule to cases involving § 1 of the Sherman Act, see Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 728-29, and § 2 of the Sherman Act, see 
Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S. at 492-94."

Wisconsin by their statutes may bring state antitrust claims as indirect purchasers."
771,15," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides: HN11[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
772,16," HN14[
] A del credere agent is defined as ""an agent who guarantees the solvency of the third party with whom the agent 
makes a contract for the principal. A del credere agent receives possession of the principal's goods for purpose of sale and 
guarantees that anyone to whom the agent sells the good on credit will pay promptly for them. For this guaranty, the agency 
receives a higher commission for sales."" Black's Law Dictionary 64 (7th ed. 1999)."
772,17," HN15[
] The principle of per se unreasonableness is that ""there are certain agreements or practices which because of their 
pernicious  [**45] effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and 
therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use."" 
Northern Pac. Ry. Co. et al., v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). Price fixing practices have 
been deemed illegal per se violations of antitrust laws. Id. "
773,18," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2 provides: HN20[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
774,19," Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs' conspiracy to monopolize claims on the ground  [**52] that it is economically 
implausible that DuPont and Pioneer, competing seed manufacturers, would conspire with Monsanto to further its efforts to 
acquire or maintain a monopoly in the market for seed traits. Plaintiffs respond that DuPont and Pioneer received a portion of the 
profits acquired as a result of the monopoly and therefore a rational economic motive exists for aiding Monsanto in its efforts to 
acquire or maintain a monopoly. Until the facts are developed further, the Court cannot make a determination as to whether any economic motive exists for the 
alleged agreements and therefore, it is proper to deny Defendants' motion to dismiss on this ground. "
775,20," 18 U.S.C. § 2314, in relevant part, provides: HN27[
] ""Whoever transports, transmits or transfers in interstate or foreign

been stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken; … Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both…."" "
776,22," Plaintiffs' state court actions were  [**62] filed in 2004; therefore, the Court's analysis is properly focused on the text of the 
2004 Technology Agreement. "
778,23," Defendants advance the same argument made here, in support of its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' state antitrust claims under 
the laws of Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and 
Wisconsin. For the reasons articulated in its analysis of Plaintiffs' claims under the Illinois Antitrust Act, the Court will also deny 
Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' antitrust claims under the states listed above except to the extent they claim that they 
are indirect purchasers. It should be noted that certain states (Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Tennessee  [**67] and Wisconsin) do not preclude state antitrust claims alleged by indirect purchasers and, 
therefore, the Court's analysis regarding the indirect purchaser bar, does not apply to those states."
778,24," In support of its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims, under the laws of Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wisconsin, Defendants advance the same 
arguments made here. For the reasons expressed in its analysis of Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim under Illinois law, the 
Court will also deny Defendants' motion with respect to the common law unjust enrichment claims listed above."
778,25," In its opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants' alleged deceptive acts were ""incurable."" 
Thus, the Court will limit its analysis to incurable acts under the statute. "
780,26," In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants did not address Plaintiff's claims under the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, Neb. 
Rev. Stat. §59-1601 et seq (2007). Therefore, the Court will not analyze Plaintiff's claims under this statute. "
781,27," 15 U.S.C. § 26 in relevant part, provides: HN55[
] ""Any person, firm, corporation or association shall be entitled to sue for 
and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or 
damage by a violation fo the antitrust laws … when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, 
 [**82] … and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue…."" "
794,1," Several of the original defendants have been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs. The remaining defendants are those listed 
in the heading of the case. "
795,2," Section 25 provides in part: HN6[
] Whenever, under the Mississippi Emergency Management Law, Sections 33-15-1 through 33-15-49, a state of 
emergency or a local emergency is declared to exist in this state, then the value received for all goods and services sold 
within the  [**10] designated emergency impact area shall not exceed the prices ordinarily charged for comparable goods 
or services in the same market area at or immediately before the declaration of a state of emergency or local emergency. Miss. Code Ann. § 75-24-25(2). "
796,3," The only provision of the CPA authorizing private actions at all is Section 15, which provides in pertinent part: HN7[
] [A]ny person who purchases or leases goods or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes and 
thereby suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use of [sic] employment by 
the seller, lessor, manufacturer or producer of a method, act or practice prohibited by Section 75-24-5 may bring an action 
at law . . . to recover such loss of money or damages for the loss of such property . . . . § 75-24-15(1)."
796,4," Subsection (6) of Section 25 provides: HN8[
] In addition to the criminal penalties prescribed in subsections (3) and (4), any knowing and willful violation of 
subsection (2) of this section shall be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice subject to and governed by all the 
procedures and remedies available under the provisions of this chapter for enforcement of prohibited acts and practices 
contained therein. Miss. Code Ann. § 75-24-25(6)"
796,5," This is a paraphrase of the plaintiffs' argument and not a direct quote. It is, however, equal to the scant effort put forth by the 
plaintiffs to defend their private right of action. "
798,6," It should be noted that both the 1986-1993 and post-1993 iterations of § 75-24-25 limit the prosecution of violations of the 
state-of-emergency pricing provision to ""enforcement"" actions. See § 75-24-25(4) (1993); § 75-24-25(6) (2007). The defendants 
suggest the term ""enforcement"" reflects legislative intent to limit prosecution of violations of § 75-24-25 to government actions. 
This interpretation provides a basis for reconciling the 1986-1993 and post-1993 iterations of § 75-24-25. Specifically, if the term 
""enforcement"" limited § 75-24-25 to government  [**20] action, no private right of action would have existed prior to the 1994 
amendment of § 75-24-5. Thus, any sign of legislative intent to preclude private action under § 75-24-25 via the 1994 
Amendment of § 75-24-5 would have been unnecessary. However, because the defendants' argument (i.e. that private actions 
are precluded under § 75-24-25 by use of the term ""enforcement"") is unpersuasive, this conclusion is tenuous. "
803,7," Specifically, New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Law § 901(b) (2007) states that ""[u]nless a statute creating or imposing a 
penalty, or a minimum measure of recovery specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class action, an action to recover a 
penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a class action."" The Donnelly 
Act, the state antitrust law under which the consumer plaintiffs asserted the class action claim, created a penalty without 
authorizing recovery via class actions. See N.Y. General Business Law § 340 et seq. "
805,8," Closely related is the rule that ""one receiving money paid to him by mistake should not be allowed to enrich himself at the 
expense of the party who paid the money to him by retaining it, but in equity and good conscience [he] should refund it."" Milliken 
& Michaels, Inc. v. Fred Netterville Lumber Co., 676 So. 2d 266, 269 (Miss. 1996). However, this rule is inapposite because the 
Complaint contains no allegations that the plaintiffs mistakenly paid money to the defendants. Rather, although legally 
insufficient, the Complaint is more fairly construed to allege that the plaintiffs knowingly purchased gasoline from the defendants 
at unconscionable prices. See Complaint PP 78, 85, 96. "
813,1," The Amended Complaint identifies eight groupings of defendants, defined as follows: (1) the Access/Renova Defendants

court decision on which Norex also relies in this connection, does not persuade this Court that a different result is appropriate. In

connection with alleged private and  [**35] Nigerian government collaboration in the forcible takeover of an area in which 90 of

828,1," Trane denominates its franchisees as ""Managers."" "
829,2," Meehan contends that the standard for a preliminary injunction has developed into a alternate ""balance of hardships test,"" as 
set forth in Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Mich. Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100 (6th Cir. 1982). This alternate test, first developed in 
Sonesta Int'l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2d Cir. 1973), requires: 1) a showing of ""sufficiently 
serious questions going to the merits"" and 2) a ""balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the 
preliminary relief."" The court in Friendship Materials held that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary 
injunction without making findings of irreparable injury to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the court retained the irreparable harm 
requirement in the alternate test. The Sixth Circuit referenced its Friendship Materials decision in In re Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., 963 F.2d 855 (6th Cir. 1992), 
stating: HN2[
] a court may, in its discretion, grant a preliminary injunction even where the plaintiff fails to show a strong or 
substantial probability  [**8] of ultimate success on the merits of his claim, but where he at least shows serious questions 
going to the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs any potential harm to the defendant if an injunction is 
issued. Id. at 105. An examination of more recent cases reveals no Sixth Circuit decisions since 1997 which expressly endorse and apply the 
substantial question/balance of hardships test. Later Circuit and district court opinions refer, rather, to Friendship Materials and 
Eagle-Picher Industries either to: 1) highlight the irreparable injury requirement of the conventional four-factor test for injunctive 
relief, see, e.g., Patio Enclosures, Inc. v. Herbst, 39 Fed.Appx. 964, 967 (6th Cir. 2002) (referencing Friendship Materials); or 2) 
to show that the four-factor standard provides somewhat flexible guidance, rather than prescribing rigid requirements, see, e.g., 
Suster v. Marshall, 149 F.3d 523, (6th Cir. 1998) (referencing Eagle-Picher Industries). Further, the ""sufficiently serious questions going to the merits"" standard, which is a lower standard than the traditional four-factor 
standard, Harris v. Equilon Enters., LLC, 107 F. Supp 2d 921, 924 (S.D. Ohio 2000), appears  [**9] more recently to be limited to 
actions arising under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA). Congress, noting that the ""franchise relationship in the 
petroleum industry is unique,"" Massey v. Exxon Corp., 942 F.2d 340 (6th Cir. 1991), and thus enacted that statute in 1978 to 
protect motor fuel marketing franchises. I conclude, accordingly that the substantial question/balance of hardships test is not appropriate in this case. I will rely on and 
apply the conventional four factor test to the pending motions. "
830,3," Trane argues that whether a valid modification has occurred in fact requires more than a finding of an oral agreement to modify 
the contract. According to Trane, a two step inquiry is necessary, whereby the court first determines whether the parties agreed 
to waive the requirement that amendments be in writing, after which the court determines whether the parties agreed on the 
particular change in the contract. "
831,," Trane finds support for this two step approach in a series of federal court decisions, Allen & O'Hara, Inc. V. Barrett Wrecking, 
Inc., 898 F.2d 512, 518 (7th Cir. 1990), unpublished cases from Wisconsin's lower state courts, Beloit Corp v. C3 Datatec, Inc., 
1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16685, 1995 WL 674602, at *11-15 (E.D. Wis. Aug. 23, 1995), Mooney & Lesage & Assocs., Ltd. v. 
Germantown Marketplace, Inc., 2000 WI App 1, 231 Wis. 2d 720, 605 N.W.2d 663, 1999 WL 103 8247, at * 1-2 (Wis. Ct. App. 
1999), and cases involving waiver of potential causes of action. See Wegner v. West Bend Mut. Ins. Co., 2007 WI App 18, 298 
Wis. 2d 420, 728 N.W.2d 30, 38 (Wis. Ct. App. 2006) (discussing waiver of a potential legal claim for contribution); Preston v. 
Meriter Hosp., Inc., 2005 WI 122, 284 Wis. 2d 264, 700 N.W.2d 158, 165 (Wis. 2005) (discussing waiver of plaintiff's potential 
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act  [**13] claim). HN8[
] The Wisconsin Supreme Court has, however, held that, if there has been a valid modification of the provision at issue, 
then by implication the parties have waived the clause requiring only written amendment. See ABC Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. 
Dolhun's Marine, Inc., 38 Wis. 2d 457, 157 N.W.2d 680, 685 (Wis. 1968) (rejecting the argument that the oral contract was void 
because the prior contract required writing to cancel or terminate). "
833,4," HN18[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act states in part that: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2007)."
833,5," I note that some authorities hold HN19[
] ""[t]ying arrangements that constrain only dealers are not presumptively illegal 
because they pose little danger to competition, as long as consumers may purchase the two goods separately."" Ransomes Am. 
Corp. v. Spartan Distribs., Inc., 914 F. Supp. 183, 185 (W.D. Mich., 1996). While such arrangements may be illegal ""they are not 
presumptively so, and it is incumbent upon the plaintiff, under 'the Rule of Reason,' to plead and show that the challenged 
arrangement has an 'actual adverse effect on competition.'"" Id. Given the direction of the Sixth Circuit on similar analyses of vertical non-price restraints,  [**22] there is reason to believe that it 
would apply the rule of reason with regard to tying arrangements that constrain dealers. Id. Meehan presents enough evidence, 
however, that his tying allegations could succeed, even under the higher ""rule of reason"" standard. Cf. CTUnify, Inc. v. Nortel 
Networks, Inc., 115 Fed. Appx. 831, 835 n.2 (6th Cir. 2004) (""In the past, this court has recognized that tying arrangements may 
be found to violate antitrust law either under a per-se or rule-of-reason analysis. These two theories of tying analysis, however, 
'have, in effect, merged in recent years.'"") (quoting PSI Repair Servs., Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 104 F.3d 811, 815 n.2 (6th Cir.

unjust enrichment. Where the plaintiff has suffered a detriment, and the defendant has received a benefit as a result, it is said 
that justice demands the repayment by the defendant of the plaintiff's loss. The measure of the defendant's liability is, however, 
limited to the value of the benefit received, whether or not it is equal to, less than, or greater than the plaintiff's loss. But, in any

863,8, The plaintiffs do not claim Wal-Mart and Circuit City conspired with each other to restrain trade. 
864,9," The Second Circuit does not appear to have addressed this question, although some district courts in the circuit have

865,10," If there were a vertical conspiracy alleged in this case, the general rule requires dismissal of a complaint that fails to join the 
other members of the conspiracy as co-defendants. See Link, 788 F.2d at 931-33; In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 
1148, 1163 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 905, 101 S. Ct. 280, 101 S. Ct. 281, 66 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1980)."
865,11," The defendants argue that ""[t]he co-conspirator exception . . . cannot apply to a tying claim for an obvious reason: the indirect 
purchaser would have to prove that the direct-purchasing victim 'passed on' the overcharge on the tied product, yet such a 'pass 
on' theory is barred by Illinois Brick."" Def. Br. 9."
865,12," The foregoing discussion arguably gives the plaintiffs' theory more credit than it deserves. At oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel 
contended that Wal-Mart and Circuit City committed an antitrust violation not by agreeing with Visa and MasterCard, but merely 
by passing along the costs of those companies' antitrust violations: [Plaintiffs' Counsel]: I think that's what Perma-Life --  [*26] if we prove to the jury, the factfinder, and not at that stage, but if 
we prove that Wal-Mart and Circuit City acquiesced for business purposes, and they knew that the tying arrangement was 
illegal and they acquiesced for their own business purposes and participated in [the] illegality of the tying arrangement by 
passing it along. "
866,," The Court: By passing it along? [Plaintiffs' Counsel]: By passing it along that makes them culpable. The Court: Did Illinois Brick just disappear with that argument? [Plaintiffs' Counsel]: I think so. July 11, 2007 Tr. at 37. As further refined, the plaintiffs' theory at oral argument was that Illinois Brick only precludes indirect 
purchaser actions where the direct purchaser is unaware of the fact that it is passing along the costs of an antitrust violation. But 
once the direct purchaser knows of the violation, it goes ""from being a, quote, victim,"" to an antitrust violator if it also passes 
along the cost. Id. at 40. According to plaintiffs' counsel, the dispositive factual question is whether the direct purchaser 
""participate[s] in illegality"" by being aware of the upstream violation and not absorbing the entire cost of it. Id.  [*27] This of 
course is not the law. "

876,4," It is not clear that a proportionate price increase, which would not affect the per-cigarette cost of doing business, would 
dissuade a tobacco company from attempting to increase its market share. We need not, however, address the merits of this 
claim, as the following discussion  [**11] will show."
876,5," It is not clear whether this extra payment would really dissuade the SPM from seeking extra market share. If an SPM would pay 
to the states less money than it would make by selling extra cigarettes, an SPM still might turn a higher profit by increasing its 
market share. Again, we need not address the merits of this claim."
876,6," The relief Sanders seeks includes: (1) A declaratory judgment that California's Qualifying Act and Contraband Amendment are both ""facially void as a per se 
restraint of trade,"" and therefore preempted by the Sherman Act. (2) An injunction against the state to keep it from enforcing the MSA and the implementing statutes, and against the 
tobacco defendants to make them ""cease their anticompetitive activity taken in furtherance of the MSA."" (3) Money damages against the tobacco defendants for operating  [**13] an illegal price-fixing cartel. "
877,," Sanders's complaint also seeks to enjoin implementation of the ""anti-competitive provisions"" of the MSA. His appeal, however, 
does not address whether the MSA itself is illegal. Sanders instead argues that the MSA is one part of a larger illegal scheme. 
We therefore need not address whether the MSA itself would be legal in the absence of the alleged larger scheme. "
878,7," The Second Circuit  [**18] has held that the MSA and its companion statutes are preempted by federal law. See Freedom 
Holdings, 357 F.3d at 222-32. The Freedom Holdings opinions (both the original and the denial of the petition for rehearing) 
feature forceful economic arguments on how tobacco companies could potentially use the MSA and its companion statutes to 
minimize price competition and keep new entrants out. The court concludes that the ""alleged arrangement, even without the 
protection of the Contraband Statutes . . . would be a per se violation because it is a naked restraint on competition . . . . With 
the Contraband Statutes in force, the scheme as alleged threatens to become a permanent, nationwide cartel."" 357 F.3d at 226. 
Freedom Holdings, however, ignores the Rice requirement that the statute ""in all cases"" mandate per se illegal conduct. The 
Sixth Circuit in Tritent disagreed with Freedom Holdings for that very reason. Tritent, 467 F.3d at 557-58. We agree with the 
Sixth Circuit and, likewise, decline to follow the Second Circuit's approach. "
879,8," We do not address whether Noerr-Pennington immunity may protect an anticompetitive settlement agreement between two 
private entities, who conceivably could claim that the act of petitioning the court to accept their agreement immunizes the 
agreement itself. "
880,9," The Second Circuit in Freedom Holdings found that the MSA implementing statutes were not themselves protected by Noerr-
Pennington immunity because ""the immunity for advocacy cannot sensibly protect the resultant anticompetitive legislation from 
being held to be preempted as in conflict with the Sherman Act. Otherwise, all such legislation would be immune."" 357 F.3d at 
233. This holding may be correct, but the defendants here do not claim that Noerr-Pennington immunity protects the 
implementing statutes from preemption. "
884,10," The Sixth Circuit, inTritent, reached a similar conclusion about the Kentucky version of the MSA scheme. The Sixth Circuit 
held that the Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 102 S. Ct. 3294, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042 (1982), preemption analysis ""must 
precede the analysis under the hybrid-restraint  [**40] theory."" Tritent, 467 F.3d at 558. Since the plaintiffs in Tritent had failed to 
demonstrate preemption, the Sixth Circuit declined to hold that the Kentucky version of the MSA scheme was a hybrid restraint.

884,11," The tobacco defendants argue that they, too, are entitled to Parker immunity. We need not reach this issue, since we have

Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Virginia. (Id. P58). Additionally, the Commissioner of Insurance for Nevada purportedly 
declared that such clauses ""violate[] the Unfair Trade Act."" (Id. P 59). Plaintiffs also claim that an insurance company's use of ""all 
products"" clauses resulted in it being charged by the Texas Attorney General with violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade 
Practice Consumer Act. (Id. P 63). Finally, plaintiffs note that ""[t]he American Medical Association has also taken a hardline 
stance against 'all products' clauses' because of their coercive effect upon physicians. (Id. P 64)."

of other States; (C) whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid Federal jurisdiction; (D) whether the action was brought in a forum with a distinct nexus with the class members, the alleged harm, or the 
defendants; (E) whether the number of citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed in all proposed plaintiff classes in the 
aggregate is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other State, and the citizenship of the other members

the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed."
888,8," Plaintiffs are arguing that the interests of justice, in general, compel this matter being remanded. They are not relying on the 
specific ""interests of justice"" CAFA exception enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(3). Plaintiffs concede that they cannot satisfy 
the statutory requirements to be eligible for this recognized exception. "
889,9," Additionally, it has been observed that placing the burden of proof on the party opposing the available exercise of federal

Sept. 4, 2007), the plaintiffs' conspiracy complaint was dismissed for failing to meet the standard under Twombly. Plaintiffs had 
alleged in conclusory fashion that defendants had agreed to restrain trade by fixing prices, rigging bids, and entering long-term 
maintenance contracts. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62734 at *9, Id. at *2. They also alleged parallel conduct based on contract 
language, product design and product pricing. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62734 at *10, Id. at *3-*4. The Second Circuit held that 
although these actions could indicate conspiracy, the allegations of agreement were simply too conclusory and the allegations of 
parallel conduct were just as consistent with legal conduct. Ibid."
908,6," Moreover, defendants' behavior could simply be consistent with conscious parallelism. Where a small number of firms can 
affect the total market output and the market price, firms' pricing decisions are interdependent. In such situations, commentators 
have noted that ""[e]ach knows that expanding its sales or lowering its price will reduce the sales of rivals, who will notice that 
fact, identify the cause, and probably respond with a matching price reduction. Unless the actor  [**43] can somehow conceal its 
price reduction or unless its own position is improved by a lower market price, it will hesitate to reduce prices at all."" 6 Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 1410b (2d ed. 2000). As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, ""conscious parallelism is the practice of 
interdependent pricing in an oligopolistic market by competitor firms that realize that attempts to cut prices usually reduce 
revenue without increasing any firm's market share, but that simply price leadership in such a market can readily increase all 
competitors' revenues."" Williamson Oil Co. v. Phillip Morris, 346 F.3d 1287, 1299 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). Such 
conscious parallelism may well be anticompetitive but it is not illegal. Here, plaintiffs have alleged that the GPU market is highly 
concentrated between ATI and Nvidia. Defendants simply may not have much of an incentive to cut prices or rush their new 
products to market. "
911,7," Further clouding the standing issue is that not all plaintiffs or putative class members purchased their computers in the same 
way. Indirect purchasers plead that consumers often have the option of upgrading their graphics processor when purchasing a 
computer (IPC PP 50-52). Sometimes the GPU is a separate entry on the invoice. Even considering only plaintiffs who 
purchased computers, some of them decided to pay more for a computer with a faster GPU. Other plaintiffs may have merely 
purchased a computer from a retail store ""as is,"" accepting whatever features the manufacturer decided to provide. This has 
serious implications for the question of whether or not any overcharges were passed on to the consumer. In the first instance, 
the overcharge is more likely to have gone to the consumer because the GPU is a separately-invoiced, traceable part of the 
finished computer. In the second instance, the overcharge may have been absorbed by the manufacturer, the retailer, or at other 
steps in the  [**54] distribution chain. The individual decisions that appear to go into purchasing a computer containing a GPU 
might cloud class certification. "
915,8," Direct purchasers refer to the acquisition as a ""merger"" in their complaint (DPC P 19). They also refer to the same transaction 
as an ""acquisition"" (ibid.). At the hearing and in the briefs, however, all parties seem to agree that AMD acquired ATI and that no 
merger took place. "
926,1, The Honorable Eden E. Hifo presided. 
928,2," On the other hand, Kam Center contends that Defendants signed the Draft Second Amendment in May 2003, but that they did 
not give the signed Draft Second Amendment to TPDs until some unknown time in May or June 2003."
928,3," Tony Roma's and Big City Diner also submitted letters of intent. Linda states that she ""didn't pay too much attention to the other 
two lease offers"" because she preferred to concentrate on the Starbucks offer."
928,4, Star Market is Kam Center's lessor under a pad lease. Star Market and Kam Center also have common officers. 
929,5," Kam Center alleged in the Complaint in numbers four through eight that (4) ""[Defendants] rent[ ] and/or [are] in possession of 
the property and/or [are] a personal guarantor under the rental agreement of the property""; (5) ""[t]here is a written rental 
agreement for the property""; (6) [Defendants] ha[ve] broken the rental agreement because [of $ 74,087.20 in] unpaid rent [and "
930,," other charges due under the Lease]""; (7) ""[w]ritten notice was given to [Defendants] on August 15, 2003 to correct this situation""; 
and (8) ""[d]espite this notice, [Defendants] ha[ve] failed to correct this situation and still [are] in possession of the property."" "
932,6," Thereafter,  [*22] on June 3, 2005, Kam Center filed a Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs against Defendants. On 
June 27, 2005, the court granted Kam Center's June 3, 2005 motion for fees and costs. On June 30, 2005, the court granted TPDs' May 24, 2005 (and supplemented on June 1, 2005) Motion for Taxation of Costs 
against Defendants. "
934,7," HRCP Rule 15(a) (2001) provides: HN7[
] (a) Amendments. A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a 
responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not 
been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a 
party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be 
freely given when justice so requires. A party  [*29] shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time 
remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period 
may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders. "
936,8," In its Counterclaim against Kam Center, Defendants alleged:"
936,8," . [Kam Center] knew  [*37] or had reason to know that [Defendants] had retained [TPDs] as [Defendants'] real estate 
agents and [Kam Center] had a duty to refrain from interfering with that relationship."
936,9," . [Kam Center] also knew or had reason to know that [TPDs] would be procuring proposals from prospective investors who 
were interested in acquiring the subject premises and [Kam Center] had a duty to refrain from interfering with [Defendants'] 
prospective business advantage and/or relationship with those investors."
936,10," . [Kam Center] tortiously, wrongfully and/or without right or privilege interfered with [Defendants'] relationship with [TPDs] 
and/or [Defendants'] prospective business advantage and/or relationship with the potential investors."
936,11," . Among other things, [Kam Center] wrongfully encouraged, caused and/or induced [TPDs] to act and/or hold themselves 
out as [Kam Center's] agent, rather than as [Defendants'] agent, and/or to solicit proposals whereby the prospective 
investors by-passed [Defendants] and offered to acquire the leased premises directly from [Kam Center]. (Emphases added.) "
937,9," Kam Center cited to the following passage from Linda's deposition: Q. Mr. Nishida asked you how much money in damages you were claiming against Mr. Kobayashi. And I have a similar 
question for you. Do you know how much money you are claiming in damages against the landlord in this lawsuit? A. We haven't discussed that. Q. Do you have any idea how you are going to figure that out? A. No. (Emphases added.)"
937,10," In light of our holding, we need not reach the parties' remaining contentions regarding this claim."
937,11," It should be noted that in its motion for summary judgment, Kam Center also argued that Defendants did not have a legitimate 
claim against Kam Center for tortious interference with a prospective contract with Tony Roma's and Big City Diner. However, in 
their memorandum in opposition to Kam Center's motion, as well as on appeal, Defendants do not argue that there was a "
938,," prospective contract with Tony Roma's or Big City Diner. Thus, our discussion is limited to whether there was a prospective 
 [*42] contract between Defendants and Starbucks."
938,12," In his deposition, Fujieki answered as follows with regard to the Starbucks transaction: Q. You can answer the question. A. My main thing was the deal had to go through. Okay? So it didn't matter to me. Q. So if Mr. Kobayashi was breaching fiduciary duties that he owed to the Chans, that didn't matter to you either? A. I didn't know if he did or did not. It's not for me. He didn't represent me. Q. And as far as -- A. If he's representing them -- Q. So it didn't matter to you? A. I had no idea or it didn't even enter my mind. Q. And it didn't enter your mind because it didn't matter to you. "
939,," A. My main concern is the deal had to go through, what do we do to make the deal go through. Q. And you were going to do what had to be done to make the deal go through MR. ASHFORD: Objection. Vague. A. Within reason. (Emphases added.) "
940,13," On the other hand, Takumi's transmittal memorandum contradicts Defendants' assertion that the parties agreed to all of the 
material terms. Takumi's memorandum plainly states, ""I am enclosing for your review a draft of the lease amendment for 
documenting the rent relief requested"" by Defendants, indicating a lack of finality as to the Second Amendment. (Emphasis 
added.) Furthermore, in its reply memorandum in support of its summary judgment motion, Kam Center pointed out that during Fujieki's 
""deposition, Defendants' counsel admitted that the proposed amendment was never executed, and that the contemplated 
transaction was never completed."" (Emphasis in original.) Fujieki's deposition states in pertinent part: BY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Q. Mr.  [*49] Fujieki, I was asking you to review the document that's marked as Exhibit No. 5, specifically, the document 
that's identified as a Second Amendment of Lease. Have you had sufficient opportunity to look at Exhibit No. 5. A. Yeah. Q. Does this document, the second amendment of lease, refresh your recollection as to whether there were negotiations for 
a further reduction in rent? A. I don't remember. You know, to be honest with you, I don't remember. I'm looking at this and I didn't sign this, so -- Q. I'm not representing that it was executed. A. Yeah. Q. It was not completed. I'll represent to you that this transaction was not completed. I'm just asking you whether you recall 
that there were negotiations. (Emphasis added.) In addition, Kam Center argued in its reply memorandum that ""[a]s Kam Center's president, Mr. Fujieki testified that any proposal 
to reduce Defendants' rent first required Defendants to pay their overdue rent, but that Defendants never did pay their rent."" 
Fujieki's deposition states in pertinent part: Q. . . . . Do you recall whether there were subsequent negotiations for the reduction of lease rent, perhaps for -- to extend 
the time for the reduced rent? A. I don't remember.  [*50] I know we tried -- we reduced it to try to help them out, and I think part of that was so that they 
could come current, but they never did. (Emphasis added.) "
941,14," As to this term, Takumi's transmittal memorandum states that ""Fujieki requested that I send you the lease amendment with the 
understanding that a mutually acceptable number that is fair, will be filled in Paragraph 6 when the lease amendment is 
executed and delivered."" (Emphasis added.) "
943,15," Accordingly, we need not reach TPDs' alternative argument that under Lee v. Aiu, Defendants cannot show the third and fifth 
elements required in a claim for tortious interference with contractual relationship. "
946,16," It should be noted that in its memorandum in opposition to TPDs' summary judgment motion, Defendants argued that they 
also sustained ""damages result[ing] from Kobayashi's failure to inform Chans of Kam Center's demands."" However, because 
Defendants do not raise that argument on appeal, we need not address it. "
947,17," HN29[
] An award of punitive damages reflects the dual purposes of ""punishing the defendant for aggravated misconduct 
and deterring the defendant and others from engaging in like conduct in the future."" Masaki v. Gen. Motors Corp., 71 Haw. 1, 12, 
780 P.2d 566, 573 (1989). In that regard, ""something more"" than mere commission of a tort is required to justify the imposition of punitive damages, as we have 
repeatedly emphasized that ""[p]unitive damages may be awarded only in cases where the wrongdoer 'has acted wantonly 
or oppressively or with such malice as implies a spirit of  [*74] mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations'; or where 
there has been 'some wilful misconduct or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of a conscious 
indifference to consequences.'"" Id. at 12-13, 780 P.2d at 573 (quoting Kang v. Harrington, 59 Haw. 652, 660-61, 587 P.2d 285, 291 (1978).) (brackets in 
original). Defendants argue that ""[d]espite the fiduciary duties imposed by law on real estate brokers and agents, Kobayashi continually 
and consistently ignored these duties and acted in his own interests to the extreme detriment of his clients."" According to 
Defendants, ""[t]he evidence showed that Kobayashi actually deceived [the] Chans by withholding the LOI and Counteroffer and 
leading them to believe that Starbucks was interested in their Lease."" Defendants further state that ""[s]uch misconduct is even 
more egregious in light of the fact that, as [the] Chans' real estate broker, [the] Chans sought assistance from Kobayashi and 
placed a great level of trust in him and his efforts."" "
950,18," Accordingly, we need not reach TPDs remaining contention that ""a motion to amend filed while a dispositive motion is pending 
falls within 'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,' warranting denial."" "
956,1," Judge Manella clearly recognized these points. She distinguished Winston by noting that Latona presented a ""wholly different 
issue"" because Latona never signed the contract at issue, enjoyed no benefit from it, and Aetna never sought to enforce it 
against her. Id. at 1097. "
959,2," Defendants also argue in the alternative that the Court grant their request for a more definite statement with reference to the 
breach of contract claim. Because the Complaint sufficiently puts Defendants on notice of which provisions are at issue, the 
Court DENIES this request. "
966,1," Under the discovery plan filed in February 2007 in the Live Concert Action, Live Nation and the plaintiffs there agreed that 
expert reports from the Nobody in Particular Presents, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'n (""NIPP"") case, an earlier antitrust action 
against Clear Channel, are discoverable. (Live Concert Second Revised Discovery Plan, Compl. Ex. 7 at p. 137.) NIPP involved an antitrust action brought by a Denver-based concert promoter against Clear Channel Entertainment and others. 
The plaintiff alleged that Clear Channel used its control over radio air play to coerce musicians into using Clear Channel 
Entertainment for concert promotion, denied plaintiff free on-air promotion and paid advertising on Clear Channel-owned radio 
stations, and hired away important employees. "
972,2," Live Nation points out that the class action complaints include references to facts alleged and/or established in previous actions 
against its co-defendants. Among these, Live Nation includes the facts described in the published opinion in the NIPP case. See 
supra note 2. See also Compl. ¶¶39-58 (referencing the NIPP, Scher, and Beccia actions as prior suits on which the current 
class action plaintiffs rely and whose facts may establish coverage for invasion of privacy, defamation, and/or disparagement). 
For example, the Live Nation alleges that the class action plaintiffs rely on facts from the Scherr case, in which the plaintiff filed a 
declaration stating that ""Clear Channel [could] use its vast resources to . . . make disparaging statement about me to musical 
acts, to interfere with my work,"" and that Clear Channel may already have done so. (Compl. ¶ 52.)"
972,3," The article was inspired by the inordinate press attention paid to the wedding of Samuel Warren's daughter because of the 
family's ""blue blood"" status. Warren also happened to be the former law partner and law school classmate of Louis Brandeis.

973,4," Prosser's view of privacy and publicity has ""almost uniformly [been] adopted"" by the courts. J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, THE RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY AND PRIVACY §1.19 (2d ed. 2007)."
973,5," ""Any person who knowingly uses another's name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness, in any manner, on or in products, 
merchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or 
services, without such person's prior consent . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as 
a result thereof."" Cal Civ Code § 3344(a) (Deering's 2007)."
973,6," Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads in relevant part: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
combine or conspire . . . to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . . shall be guilty of a 
felony."" In order to assert a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant 1) possessed monopoly power 
in the relevant market, 2) wilfully acquired or maintained that power through exclusionary conduct and 3) caused antitrust injury. 
MetroNet Services Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124, 1130 (9th Cir. 2004). To assert a claim for attempted monopolization, also prohibited by § 2, the underlying class action plaintiffs must allege that Live 
Nation and its co-defendants had (1) a specific intent to monopolize a relevant market — i.e., an intent to control prices or 
destroy competition in a relevant market; (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct designed to control prices or destroy 
competition; (3) a dangerous probability of success — i.e., a probability of achieving monopoly power in the relevant market; and 
(4) causal antitrust injury. Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456 (1993). Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. §2. "
974,7," Monopoly power is ""the power to control prices or exclude competition,"" United States v. El du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 
U.S. 377, 391 (1956))."
974,8," The Policy defines covered ""Wrongful Acts"" as ""any duty act [sic], error, misstatement, misleading statement or omission in the 
conduct of . . . professional services . . . which constitutes: . . . (c) any form of invasion, infringement, or interference with rights 
of privacy or publicity . . . ."" (Policy at p. 16.) Each ""wrongful act"" is described in legal terms: e.g., ""infringement of copyright;"" 
""false light, public disclosure of private facts;"" ""any form of defamation or other tort;"" ""false arrest, detention, imprisonment or 
malicious prosecution."" Id."
974,9," Defined as ""extensive mention in the news media or by word of mouth or other means of communication,"" the ""public notice so 
gained,"" ""the technique, process, or business of securing public notice,"" or ""the state of being public, or open to general 
observation or knowledge."" RANDOM HOUSE WEBSTER'S COLLEGE DICTIONARY 1054 (2d ed. 1997)."
974,10," Defined as ""1. the state of being private; retirement or seclusion. 2. freedom from the intrusion of others in one's private life or 
affairs . . . ."" Id. at 1036. See also MCCARTHY at § 1:6 (""What most people intuitively think of when they hear the word 'privacy' is 
some situation which fits within that category that the law now labels as the tort of invasion of privacy by the public disclosure of 
embarrassing private facts."")."
974,11," Live Nation's arguments attempt to shoe-horn actions for which there is no coverage into covered wrongful acts by casting the 
factual allegations in the underlying complaints as tortious. Its contention that the alleged anticompetitive conduct could be 
characterized as ""interference with the right of privacy,"" ""defamation,"" or ""disparagement and trade libel,"" therefore is unavailing. 
Live Nation points to legal conclusions in its Complaint as evidence of underlying facts supporting a finding of a possibility of 
coverage under the Policy. This is insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. For example, Live Nation argues in its complaint that there is potential coverage for alleged defamation under the Policy. 
However, in doing so, Live Nation points to the Thompson SAC for the proposition that Live Nation is accused of ""outrageous, 
unprivileged and injurious statements to artists and others . . . ."" (Compl. ¶ 49.) However, the Thompson SAC includes the 
following allegations of wrongful conduct: merger and acquisitions for the purpose of monopolization (¶36); predatory hiring and 
misuse of non-compete agreements (¶37); using its ""size and clout to coerce artists"" to use Clear Channel concert promotion 
services or risk losing radio airplay (¶ 41); paying inflated fees to artists to prevent competition (¶¶46-47); and refusing to sell 
radio advertising time to competing concert promoters (¶48). The Court cannot discern any possibility of characterizing these 
allegations as any of the covered wrongful acts, including defamation and disparagement or trade libel as Live Nation asserts. 
(Compl. ¶¶49, 56). "
983,1," Defendants have informed the court that PacifiCare has previously been captioned incorrectly as ""PacifiCare Health Systems, 
Inc.,"" when it is in fact an LLC. (Mot. to Dismiss 1.) Absent a stipulation correcting the record, the court will expect PacifiCare to 
move for a substitution."

Brief in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be cited as ""Defs.' Reply."" "
984,3," Although this fact was not alleged in the complaint, the court notes that UnitedHealth, as of June 2006, was the largest of all 
the PDPs, thanks in part to a plan endorsement by the AARP, a powerful seniors lobbying group. Amy Merrick, Getting an 
 [**6] 'A' in Part D--While Others Complained, Walgreen Found Way to Profit From Drug Plan for Seniors, Wall St. J., June 21,

985,4," As to the fifth element, all that is needed to plead an effect on interstate commerce is a conclusory statement, because 
nowadays nearly all antitrust offenses will affect interstate  [**12] commerce. Hammes, 33 F.3d at 778-79. Omnicare has alleged 
that the Defendants' anti-competitive activities affected interstate commerce. (Am. Compl. P 20.) "
1003,1," All pleadings and exhibits related to these dispositive motions have been filed under seal, pursuant to a procedure previously 
outlined by this court. (See Doc. 783 at 5.) The parties are directed to the court's conclusion, infra page 124, for the court's 
direction concerning the continued provision of these  [**7] documents under seal."
1003,2," The defendants were grouped by corporate association, e.g., Aetna Health Inc. was grouped with Aetna Life Insurance 
Company. "
1004,3," Collectively, Aetna, Coventry, United, Cigna, Blue Cross, and Humana will be referred to as the ""MCO Defendants."" MCO is an 
acronym for Managed Care Organization. This term, and those related to it, will be discussed in more detail below."
1004,4," Collectively, HCA Midwest, Saint Luke's, Shawnee Mission Medical Center, Carondelet, and North Kansas City Hospital will be 
referred to as the ""Hospital Defendants."""
1004,5," As stated in Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, Inc., 899 F.2d 951, 956-57 n.5 (10th Cir. 1990): ""HMOs and PPOs are 
prospective reimbursement arrangements, in which a member or subscriber pays a monthly amount to medical care providers "
1005,," who then oversee all the health care needs of the member. In an HMO  [**12] or PPO, the member typically pays less for health 
care coverage than under a traditional indemnity insurance plan, but is limited in his or her choice of medical care providers."""
1005,6," Some of the defendants dispute Heartland's use of Hay's expert report on the basis that an expert ""cannot testify as to facts."" 
(See, e.g., Docs. 901 at 5; 921 at 12; 920 at 6.) Defendants, however, cite Hay's testimony in support of their own alleged facts 
(see, e.g., Docs. 901 at 5; 921 at 1 n.3, 6, 17-18; 920 at 15) and do not, at this point, offer any legal argument for the exclusion 
of Hay's opinion testimony on any other basis. "
1006,7," Blue Cross is by far the largest MCO in the Kansas City area with forty-two percent share of enrollees. United is the second 
largest (18%), Coventry is the third largest (11%), Aetna is the fourth largest (8%), Humana is the sixth largest (5%), and Cigna 
is the eighth largest (2%). (Doc. 833 P 4.)"
1006,8," HCA  [**17] Midwest is by far the largest hospital system in the Kansas City metropolitan area with twenty-eight percent share 
of the market. Saint Luke's is the second largest (16%), North Kansas City Hospital is the fourth largest (11%), Shawnee Mission 
Medical Center is the fifth largest (10%), and Carondelet is the seventh largest (8%). (Doc. 833 P 2.)"
1006,9," Kansas is not a ""Certificate of Need"" state, which means that anyone who wants to build a new hospital may do so without first 
obtaining a determination from the State that there is a need for the hospital. (Doc. 852 P 29.) In addition, Kansas does not have 
an ""any willing provider"" law that requires MCOs to offer contracts to all providers. (Doc. 778 P 13.)"
1006,10," In this section, and elsewhere within the factual recitation, the court includes those defendants which have been dismissed 
from this litigation. The court does this for the limited purpose of providing the relevant background information concerning the 
Kansas City metropolitan healthcare industry and makes no finding with respect to those defendants' liability as co-conspirators. "
1007,11," The court often uses the corporate entity's name as the actor in negotiations or other actions, without identifying the name of 
the specific person who was involved or who made the statement attributed to the corporate entity. This is done in order to 
simplify the record for ease of reading. The parties also engage in this practice at times. "
1008,12," Saint Luke's, in its motion for summary judgment, refers to its ""four hospitals in the Kansas City area"" (Doc. 835 P 22), rather 
than the three hospitals contemplated by Heartland's Third Amended Complaint and Saint Luke's answer thereto. This 
discrepancy is irrelevant to the court's analysis."
1008,13," This subsection, discussing the parties' contractual relationships concerning provider agreements, is admittedly incomplete. In 
some portions, the parties failed to address whether the parties had a provider agreement at all, and the court so notes. In other 
portions, the parties establish that a provider agreement exists between the parties, but fail to identify the appropriate time 
frame, or whether network configuration language  [**23] is included in the agreement. The court presents the information it has 
been provided, and notes that the provider agreements that are discussed are simply the ones discussed at length by the 
parties. "
1013,14, Heartland does not consider itself to be an ambulatory surgical center. (Doc. 835 P 11.) 
1017,15," In addition, in a 2005 study, Saint Luke's determined that payors it had interviewed (which included Aetna, Blue Cross, Cigna, 
Coventry, and United, i.e., all the MCO Defendants) identified needs for orthopaedic and neurosurgery physicians throughout the 
Kansas City area. (Doc. 899 P 77.) "
1018,16," Coventry received a letter from the vice president of compensation and benefits for Sprint, E.J. (Ned) Holland, on June 3, 2002 
which specifically requested that Coventry not add any new facilities to networks that serve Sprint employees. Sprint believed 
that the addition of new facilities would lead to rate increases to pay for overcapacity, which would ultimately increase what it 
cost Sprint to provide healthcare to its employees. (Doc. 852 P 44.) "
1019,17," For example, Coventry  [**57] recognized Blue Cross as a competitor. (Doc. 899 P 102.) "
1021,18," The Hospital Defendants object to Dr. Maloney's statement as ""hearsay"" (Doc. 920 at 5) without citing the Rules of Evidence 
or case authority. Inadmissible hearsay cannot be relied upon either to support or oppose summary judgment. Riggs v. Airtran 
Airways, Inc.,497 F.3d 1108, 2007 WL 2258826, at *10 (10th Cir. 2007). However, it is not clear that Dr. Maloney's statement is 
hearsay (Rule 801(d)(2)(A) and/or (E)) or, possibly, an exception (Rule 804(b)(3)). This question may have to be resolved at a 
later date but for now, the Hospital Defendants' generic ""hearsay"" objection is insufficient. "
1024,19," Kozisek testified that she did not learn this through her attendance at the HFMA Meeting. (Doc. 833 P 13.) The HFMA Meeting 
is discussed in more detail below. "
1025,20," Heartland also alleges facts concerning the parties' lobbying activities. The Missouri Hospital Association (""MHA"") is a trade 
associations composed of hospitals in their respective states. The MHA represents and advocates on behalf of hospitals in their 
respective states, and seeks to educate the public and state legislatures about health care issues. Both the Kansas Hospital 
Association (""KHA"") and the MHA have approached state governments to persuade them to limit the number of specialty 
hospitals in their respective  [**78] states. (Doc. 835 P 66.) HCA Midwest, Saint Luke's, Carondelet, and North Kansas City Hospital are members of the MHA. HCA Midwest, Saint Luke's, 
and Shawnee Mission Medical Center are members of the KHA. (Doc. 835 P 67.) Each of the hospitals has participated in 
lobbying efforts at the federal and state levels to enact legislation relating to physician-owned hospitals. (Doc. 835 P 68.) This information is of little consequence. HN1[

1035,28," Even if the court did not characterize Kozisek's testimony as weak direct evidence, her testimony is certainly circumstantial 
evidence of an agreement amongst MCO Defendants. Combined with the economic motive and additional circumstantial 
evidence discussed below, the court's ultimate conclusions herein would remain unchanged. "
1037,29," At oral argument, Coventry framed Heartland's economic theory as economically implausible because it would have been 
impractical for the MCOs to keep a lower cost, higher quality, specialty hospital out of the MCOs' networks. This, of course, 
ignores the rate concessions the MCO Defendants received from the Hospital  [**124] Defendants in exchange for excluding 
Heartland."
1037,30," These facts are either uncontroverted or, if controverted, taken in a light most favorable to Heartland. "
1038,31," In Mitchael, the plaintiffs attempted to allege direct evidence of a conspiracy, but, based on certain evidentiary findings, this 
direct evidence was not analyzed by the district court, a decision the Tenth Circuit affirmed on appeal. Id. at 858."
1038,32," In  [**129] Reazin, the Tenth Circuit defined maximum allowable payments as the maximum allowable payment paid from the 
MCO to the hospital provider for each service provided by the hospital provider to the insureds. Id. at 957 n.7. The court believes 
the maximum allowable payments are similar to the negotiated payment rates present in the provider agreements in this case. "
1039,33," At oral argument, the Hospital Defendants attempted to distinguish Reazin on  [**131] the basis of whether that court was 
considering a per se or rule of reason antitrust claim. At this point, the court finds evidence of an agreement regardless of the 
styling of the antitrust claim. "
1040,34," At oral argument, counsel acknowledged the significance of coercion or threats (or lack thereof) in discussions regarding 
whether Reazin and Abraham can be reconciled. For example, Heartland argued that HCA Midwest's admission of its 
threatened rate increase to Aetna, despite HCA Midwest's acknowledgment that it had no basis for the proposed penalty, was 
an example of threats from the Hospital Defendants to the MCO Defendants of rate increases if the MCO Defendants would not 
agree to the network configuration language. As might be expected, there is great disagreement about whether evidence of 
threats or  [**137] coercion exists, which, of course, militates against summary judgment. "
1043,35," At oral argument, Aetna's counsel asserted that Kozisek's testimony is not admissible under. Fed. R. Evid. 602 and 701, citing 
ORI, Inc. v. Lanewala, 147 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1080 (D. Kan. 2001). In ORI, Inc., Chief Judge Lungstrum refused to consider on 
summary judgment affidavits of company officers who ""do not contend to have  [**147] witnessed, overheard or otherwise 
experienced"" the actions of a former officer; in other words, that the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the subject matter in 
their affidavits. Here, the court is satisfied that Kozisek was in a position to have at least some knowledge of the ""unwritten understanding"" and 
""gentlemen's agreement."" Beyond that, it is pertinent that her statements were made at a deposition, where she could be 
questioned regarding the basis of her knowledge of the ""understanding"" and ""agreement,"" including the persons and/or entities 
involved or, perhaps more pertinent, not involved. While the court assigns no criticism to the lawyers who did not explore these 
matters, it is not in a position to find Kozisek's testimony inadmissible, especially at summary judgment."
1043,36," The court assumes that the portions of Kozisek's testimony which it has been provided are the relevant portions. In the clear 
light of 20-20 hindsight, Kozisek could have been asked additional questions or she could have been permitted to explain her 
answers in more detail, but whether that would have made a difference is speculation. Should Kozisek be called as a witness at "
1044,," trial, what she may say is also speculation. The point is that HN23[
] at summary judgment, her testimony must be viewed in 
the light most favorable to Heartland."
1044,37," Aetna does little more than fall back on its main argument to this court: that the estimated one and a half million dollar rate 
concession it would have forfeited to HCA Midwest if it had added Heartland to its network in July 2003 was a sufficient 
independent business reason for its exclusion of Heartland. This argument ignores the direct evidence of an agreement - 
Kozisek's testimony - and the standards of law  [**152] that apply when direct evidence is shown and fails to take into account 
Aetna's rejection of Heartland after the Aetna-HCA Midwest provider agreement was renegotiated. "
1047,38," The Hospital Defendants' motion for summary judgment makes the argument that Heartland must prove a horizontal 
agreement to threaten to refuse to deal with MCOs if the MCOs contracted with Heartland,  [**163] rather than a horizontal 
agreement to structure contracts with MCOs that cause a boycott of Heartland. (Doc. 835 at 17.) Heartland disputes this 
characterization of its complaint. (Doc. 899 at 40.) Count One of Heartland's Third Amended Complaint alleges a horizontal 
agreement amongst Hospital Defendants to effectuate a boycott by MCOs of Heartland, and that this horizontal agreement is 
either a per se violation of § 1 or a violation of § 1 under the rule of reason. (Doc. 249 at 21-22.) Count Two of Heartland's Third "
1048,," Amended Complaint alleges that the Hospital Defendants, with the Managed Care Defendants, engaged in a boycott of 
Heartland. (Doc. 249 at 23-24.) Regardless of the parties' characterization of this dispute, the court finds that the Hospital 
Defendants have moved for a summary ruling that they (the Hospital Defendants) did not participate in a horizontal agreement in 
restraint of trade. The court cannot so find, for the reasons stated herein, despite the arguments of the Hospital Defendants' 
highly competent and experienced counsel. "
1052,39, The parties do not dispute that Kansas law applies to Heartland's common law tort claims. 
1061,1," Curler also argued that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all six of Vanguard's theories of recovery asserted in

1062,5," In the first paragraph, Vanguard claims that the Trial Court erred in granting summary judgment ""for the reason that no 
evidence of any kind was presented by [Curler] in her [summary judgment motion] tending to establish that the anti-solicitation 
provisions in question were unreasonable under the circumstances."" Vanguard concludes this first paragraph by stating: ""A trial 
court should not grant summary judgment if reasonable minds could draw different inferences or conclusions from the facts."" In 
the second paragraph, Vanguard  [***7] complains that ""no testimony of any kind was presented to the Court establishing why 
any reasonable person would conclude that the anti-solicitation provisions were unquestionably an undue restraint of trade."" It 
then asserts that ""the Trial Court had no basis to determine the anti-solicitation provisions constituted an unreasonable restraint 
of trade, other than the express provisions of the Employment Agreement in question."""

 [***15]"
1064,15," For example, HN12[
] some restraints are so injurious to competition that  [***16] they are considered unlawful as a matter of 
law . See Crown Paint Co. v. Bankston, 1981 OK 104, P 7, 640 P.2d 948, 950; Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. U.S., 356 U.S. 1, 78 S. 
Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). Agreements between competitors to fix the price of goods or services, the chief ""evil"" of 
monopolies, is the most widely recognized of these per se offenses. See United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 
47 S. Ct. 377, 71 L. Ed. 700 (1927). But equally prohibited by the per se rule, as it was at common law, is an agreement 
between competitors to divide markets by customers or territory. See U.S. v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 
31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). In the context of post-employment restraints, however, partial customer and/or territory allocations to 
take effect in the future, between would-be competitors but parties who are not competitors at the time of contracting, have not 
been treated as per se violations. See, e.g., Tatum v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 1970 OK 27, 465 P.2d 448. "
1065,16," See, e.g., E.S. Miller Laboratories v. Griffin, 1948 OK 149, 200 Okla. 398, 194 P.2d 877 (finding unenforceable a prohibition 
on every kind of employment for a competing firm in the territory to which a pharmaceutical salesman  [***17] had been 
assigned). The Court did not analyze or define the relevant product market, but that would not have changed the result. The ban 
on all employment would have included pharmaceutical sales."
1065,17," ""Geographic,"" in this sense, was determined by the location of the customers rather than a geographic area and, therefore, did 
not prohibit solicitation of a potential client who was not a customer of the employer, even if located next door to a customer of 
the employer.  [***19] A similar relevant market analysis is conducted in Bayly."
1065,18," The Tatum Court discussed fair and unfair forms of competition in the context of its Rule of Reason analysis but declined to 
follow California cases that appear to have decided the ""reasonableness"" of the contract based on the existence of unfair trade 
practices, such as theft of trade secrets, disparagement of a competitor or its products. These practices are specifically 
precluded by other statutes in Oklahoma and do not depend on the existence of any contract subject to review pursuant to 
section 217. See,  [***20] e.g., Oklahoma Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 78 O.S.2001 §§ 51-55; Brenner v. Stavinsky, 1939 OK

first provision effectively precluded Mammana from being able to practice in his specialty. The Court was unpersuaded by the 
employer's argument that the restriction was, nonetheless, reasonable because Mammana was not prevented from practicing 
some other specialty. The Court then found the second provision enforceable pursuant to Tatum."
1066,20," Covenant to not Compete, Trade Secret, Confidentiality, Proprietary Information, Works of Authorship, Issues Related

1066,21," Although appearing in Curler's reply, Vanguard did not ask to file a response contesting this characterization, and Curler's

1068,22," That interpretation is consistent with the clear intent of the contract provision preceding the  [***29] marketing ban, which

1098,2," Plaintiff argued in response to Defendants' motion to dismiss that it was unable to provide evidence to support its claims

1100,3," Plaintiff's complaint also alleges that the defendants engaged in ""'horizontal' restraints of trade, by taking the direction and/or 
coercion of its customer, defendant Erickson Decorating Products, and possibly other companies who compete with plaintiff, to 
suppress or substantially lessen competition by threatening plaintiff, and then eliminating plaintiff's distributorship."" (Complaint, 
P32). Horizontal restraints of trade are ordinarily per se illegal. Assam Drug Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., 798 F.2d 311, 315 n. 8 
(8th Cir. 1986). Plaintiff's ""horizontal restraint"" claim cannot survive defendants' summary judgment motion, however, because 
Plaintiff does not direct the Court to anything in its materials opposing defendants' summary judgment motion which would lend 
support to any theory of ""direction and/or coercion"" of defendants by Erickson's Decorating Products, or any other competitor of 
Plaintiff's. Similarly, though Plaintiff puts forward a price-fixing theory, Plaintiff directs the court to nothing in its materials which would lend 
any support to the notion that there was, between Basic and any of its distributors, ""an express or implied agreement to set 
resale prices at some  [*11] level."" Business Electronics Co. v. Sharp Electronics Co., 485 U.S. 717, 720, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L.

1100,4," The distinction between ""interbrand"" and ""intrabrand"" competition has been explained as follows: ""Interbrand competition is the 
competition among the manufacturers of the same generic  [*12] product . . . and is the primary concern of antitrust law. . . . In 
contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors wholesale or retail of the product of a particular 
manufacturer."" Sylvania at 52 n. 19. Though defendants argue that, in cases involving a manufacturer's termination of a distributor, the party complaining of a 
Sherman Act violation must allege anticompetitive effect at the interbrand level, a restraint affecting only intrabrand competition "
1101,," may be cognizable under the Sherman Act, depending on the characteristics of the relevant interbrand market. Itek at 1572 n. 
20."
1101,5," Indeed, Plaintiff argues that it ""is not a competitor of defendants Basic and Atlas."" (Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to 
Defendants' Joint Motion for Judgment Pursuant to Rule 56(c) and Defendants' Refiled Motion Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to 
Dismiss Complaint at 8) (emphasis in original)."
1101,6," As evidence that Basic's conduct decreased competition, Plaintiff points to a portion of its deposition of its President, Rick 
Walters, and a portion of its deposition of Albert Maghes, Plaintiff's Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The portion of 
Walters's deposition testimony alleges that Plaintiff was treated unfairly by Basic, but does not refer to any reduction in 
competition as a whole in the intrabrand market as a result of Basic's conduct, or indeed to any effect of the conduct of Basic on 
any distributor besides Plaintiff. (Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendants' Joint Motion for Judgment Pursuant to Rule 
56(c), Ex. 1 at 94-95). Plaintiff also points to a portion of Maghes's deposition testimony in which Maghes refers  [*16] to Basic's 
""marketing strategy to allow anybody that had the product to sell it anywhere"" and alleges that this strategy ""was very negative to 
Basic Coating and their local distributor"" because it ""discourage[d] the local guy who's doing the work in creating the sale from 
moving forward and increasing, increasing sales for myself and Basic."" ( Id., Ex. 3 at 108). Taken in the light most favorable to 
Plaintiff, Maghes here alleges that Basic as a matter of policy did not enforce or enter into exclusive distributorship 
arrangements, and argues that this harmed certain ""local"" distributors. But Maghes says nothing about the effect of such 
conduct by Basic on competition as a whole in the intrabrand market, as opposed to its effect on individual distributors who 
might be in a position to benefit from exclusive distributorship arrangements. "
1103,7," Maghes also alleges in his testimony Basic was giving another distributor, Acme Flooring, inventory on consignment. But 
Maghes concedes that Basic ""was not selling them [product]"" but ""giving them product."" (Plaintiff's Ex. 3 at 132). Maghes thus 
fails to allege a ""sale,"" as is required to state a Robinson-Patman Act claim. Indeed, a consignment arrangement does not 
implicate the antitrust laws ""so long as the contractual relationship between the parties reflects a true consignment rather than a 
disguised sale of the goods."" Miller v. W.H. Bristow, Inc., 739 F. Supp. 1044, 1052 (D.S.C. 1990); accord E & L Consulting, Ltd. 
v. Doman Industries Ltd., 472 F.3d 23, 32 (2d Cir. 2006) (Robinson-Patman ""applies only to price discrimination between 
different purchasers"" and ""consignment contracts are not covered."") (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing in Maghes's 
testimony indicates that the consignment arrangement was a ""disguised sale."" "

1112,10," Novell does not market an operating system comparable to Microsoft Windows. Novell did at one time own an operating 
system known as Novell DOS, which it sold to Caldera, Inc. (""Caldera"") in 1996. Before the district court, Microsoft argued that 
Novell sold its claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization of the PC operating-system market to Caldera along with 
its PC operating-system business. Therefore, Microsoft asserted that in addition to lacking antitrust standing as to Counts I and 
VI, Novell no longer owned the claims therein. The district court rejected Microsoft's argument. However, as noted above, we granted Microsoft's petition for interlocutory 
appeal on the antitrust-standing issue only, and thus the  [**9] question of ownership of the claims is not before us. "

1114,14," ""Middleware"" is a term used to refer to software products that have the capability to serve as platforms for software 
applications themselves. Microsoft II, 253 F.3d at 53. They expose, or make available, their own APIs, see supra note 6, and 
theoretically, software developers could rely upon these APIs rather than Windows's APIs for basic routines. Id. Because Java 
and Navigator were written for multiple operating systems, software developers could potentially use them as platforms for their 
applications rather than rewriting them for each operating system. Id. However, no middleware product could expose nearly 
enough APIs to serve as a platform for popular applications or to usurp operating-system functions. Id. Nor, the district court 
found and the D.C. Circuit affirmed, would any middleware product do so in the foreseeable future. Id. Notably, Microsoft did not 
challenge  [**16] these findings, apparently conceding that Java and Navigator were not present competitors of its Windows 
operating system. Id. Microsoft does not argue to this court that Java and Navigator are now its competitors either. "

1115,16," HN7[
] The concept of antitrust standing is narrower than constitutional standing. ""Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to

""the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" AGC, 459 U.S. at 535 n.31 (citing Daniel Berger & Roger 
Bernstein, An Analytical Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 809, 813 n.11 (1977)). This inquiry requires us to focus 
on the multiple factors  [**22] identified by the Supreme Court in AGC. Id. at 537-44. "
1116,17," The plaintiffs in Kloth were indirect purchasers of Microsoft's operating system; that is, they did not buy the software directly 
from Microsoft. Therefore, we held that they were barred from seeking recovery for illegal pass-through overcharges under the 
principles of Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Kloth, 444 F.3d at 317. The 
holding in Illinois Brick, that only direct purchasers of products affected by the antitrust violations can sue for treble damages 
under § 4 of the Clayton Act, see 431 U.S. at 729-30, is generally inapplicable to the instant appeal. In Kloth, however, we also 
applied the AGC factors and found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek recovery for injuries other than overcharges. 444 
F.3d at 324-25."
1116,18," In Brunswick, the plaintiff, a retail bowling center, sued the defendant, who acquired several rival retail bowling centers that 
otherwise would have closed. 429 U.S. at 488. The plaintiff was denied antitrust standing because losing profits as a result of 
enhanced competition is not the type of injury the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. Id. Awarding damages for that type of 
injury, the Supreme Court noted, ""is inimical to purposes of these laws."" Id."
1116,19," It may be more likely that a consumer or competitor in the relevant market will suffer an antitrust injury than a plaintiff who is 
neither a competitor nor a consumer. This does not necessarily preclude, however, a party who is neither from having an 
antitrust injury. Thus, like the Supreme Court in AGC, we do not stop our analysis merely because Novell is neither a competitor 
nor a consumer. "
1117,20," Microsoft further relies on cases from the Third  [**27] and Ninth Circuits which appear to adopt a consumer-or-competitor 
rule. Barton & Pittinos, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 118 F.3d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 1997); Exhibitors' Serv., Inc. v. Am. Multi-
Cinema, Inc., 788 F.2d 574, 579 (9th Cir. 1986). However, the courts in both circuits later explicitly moved away from those 
narrowing decisions. See Carpet Group Int'l v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n, Inc., 227 F.3d 62, 76-77 & n.12 (3d Cir. 2000) 
(noting that Barton & Pittino's's holding ""rest[ed] on an overstated premise,"" that, ""if construed as an absolute . . ., may in some 
circumstances lead to results that conflict with Supreme Court and other precedent""); Amer. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Telephone 
Co. of Calif., 190 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir. 1999) (declaring that limiting antitrust standing to consumers and competitors would 
contravene Supreme Court precedent). For further discussion of the possible myopia of limiting antitrust standing to consumers 
or competitors in the relevant market, see Ronald W. Davis, Standing on Shaky Ground: The Strangely Elusive Doctrine of 
Antitrust Injury, 70 Antitrust L.J. 697, 760-65 (2003)."
1117,21," Unlike Novell, the plaintiff in Thompson Everett maintained that it was a competitor of the defendant. However, this court 
rejected that characterization. Thompson Everett, 57 F.3d at 1325. "
1118,22," Microsoft does not deny that Sun and Netscape would have had standing for a private suit. Instead, Microsoft focuses on the 
fact that middleware products such as Java and Navigator had the technological potential to compete with operating systems in 
the future. See Microsoft II, 253 F.3d at 53-55. The hypothetical future capabilities of Java and Navigator do not meaningfully 
distinguish such products from Novell's applications, however. Indeed, Java and Navigator, like WordPerfect and Quattro Pro 
here, exist outside the market unlawfully monopolized by Microsoft. As with Novell's office-productivity applications, the primary 
threat that Java and Navigator posed to Windows was not that they were competitors or potential competitors in the operating-
system market (indeed, the court found that they were not competitors or potential competitors within the relevant time frame) 
but rather that, from outside that market, they could enable an alternative  [**33] operating system to compete with Windows. Id. 
at 55, 60, 74-80. The anticompetitive activities that harmed Java and Navigator are undeniably similar to those alleged by Novell. For example, 
the D.C. Circuit found that provisions in Windows licenses issued to OEMs restricting them from distributing browsers other than 
Microsoft's own served to reduce Netscape's browser's market share: Therefore, Microsoft's efforts to gain market share in one market (browsers) served to meet the threat to Microsoft's 
monopoly in another market (operating systems) by keeping rival browsers from gaining the critical mass of users 
necessary to attract developer attention away from Windows as the platform for software development. Id. at 60. Additionally, the D.C. Circuit cited internal Microsoft memoranda indicating an objective ""to thwart Java's threat to 
Microsoft's monopoly in the market for operating systems,"" in which Microsoft espoused an intent to deceive Java developers 
into writing applications that only performed properly on Windows. Id. at 76-77 (citing a Microsoft document that stated, ""Cross-
platform [i.e., multiple operating system] capability is by far the number one reason for choosing/using  [**34] Java""). "
1119,," As noted above, we are not sufficiently persuaded by Microsoft's proffered distinction between Novell's products and middleware 
to consider irrelevant the parallels between Novell's claims and the government's claims."
1119,23," The Supreme Court has likened the common-law tort concept of proximate cause to the directness inquiry required by the 
additional AGC factors, emphasizing that both are somewhat elusive. See McCready, 457 U.S. at 477, 478 n.13 (""The traditional 
principle of proximate cause suggests the use of words such as 'remote,' 'tenuous,' 'fortuitous,' 'incidental,' or 'consequential' to 
describe those injuries that will find no remedy at law . . . . And the use of such terms only emphasizes that the principle of 
proximate cause is hardly a rigorous analytic tool."") (internal citations omitted)."
1119,24," Of course, in the absence of Microsoft's alleged violations (i.e., in an unrestrained market), Novell's products still may have 
suffered from the competition from Microsoft's applications, but damage from competition is not what the antitrust laws protect. 
See Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488. "
1121,25," The psychologists harmed by the anticompetitive activity at issue in McCready had,  [**44] in fact, already maintained a 
successful suit against the insurer. 457 U.S. at 470 n.4. However, their injury (lost profits in selling their services) was distinct 
from that of McCready (reduced coverage on her health insurance policy). "
1122,26," With a November 2002 consent decree ending the government's suit and triggering, one year later, the ticking of the statute of 
limitations' Novell to assert Counts I and VI. We thus affirm the district court's clock, any plaintiff's similar claims arising before 
the end of the government suit would appear to be untimely. See 15 U.S.C. § 16(i); United States v. Microsoft Corp., 231 F. 
Supp. 2d 144 (D.D.C. 2002). "
1124,27," Novell points to several lower-court decisions in which statutes of limitations were tolled  [**55] when the markets involved in 
the private suit and the government suit were not identical. See In re Arizona Dairy Products Litigation, No. CIV 74-569A, 1984 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22199 (D. Ariz. Nov. 5, 1984) (finding limitations period tolled for filing of claim in private action for price-fixing 
conspiracy in retail milk market based on government suit for price-fixing in wholesale milk market); In re Antibiotic Antitrust 
Actions, 333 F. Supp. 317, 320-21 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (finding limitations period tolled for claim for damages suffered in a foreign 
broad spectrum antibiotics market for agricultural consumption by government suit for conduct in domestic broad spectrum 
antibiotics market for human consumption). The markets in both of the above cases were defined rather specifically, however, 
and a broader market definition could have included both that at issue in the government action and that at issue in the private 
action (e.g., the ""milk market"" or the ""broad spectrum antibiotics market""). No reasonably broader market definition could 
encompass both the operating-system market at issue in the government action against Microsoft and the office-productivity-
applications market at issue here."
1124,28," Section 5(i) applies only to actions brought by the United States, so the Attorneys' General action did not toll the limitations

1134,2," At the hearing, counsel for Unisys indicated that for its server operations, Unisys' module makers independently negotiated with 
defendants to establish DRAM prices that varied from module maker to module maker; the module makers ordered the DRAM 
directly from defendants; defendants shipped the DRAM to the module makers; and the module makers then shipped the 
DRAM-containing modules to Unisys in the United States. Accordingly, there was no master agreement negotiating DRAM 
prices between Unisys and the module makers. It is unclear; however, whether any such master agreements were in place with 
respect to any direct purchases of DRAM made by Unisys from defendants, in connection with Unisys' server manufacturing 
operations. "
1135,3," While plaintiff subsequently filed a second amended complaint (""SAC"") on June  [**17] 29, 2007, it is identical to the FAC, but 
adds certain Hitachi defendants. Accordingly, the parties have stipulated that the pending motion to dismiss the FAC shall be 
applied equally and in full to the allegations in the SAC, and that the motion shall be deemed a response to both the SAC and 
the FAC. The court cites to the SAC, as that is the operative complaint."
1135,4," The moving defendants are Samsung Electronics Co. and Samsung Semiconductor (""Samsung""), Elpida, Micron Technology 
Inc. and Micron Semiconductor Products Inc. (""Micron""), Infineon, NEC Electronics America, Nanya, Winbond, Mosel-Vitelic, and 
Mitsubishi. NEC Corporation and Hynix  [**19] have filed a joinder in the motion to dismiss. "
1137,5," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs do not meet the ""export"" exception of the FTAIA. HN11[
] The FTAIA provides that if the 
Sherman Act applies to conduct involving foreign trade or commerce only because such conduct has a direct, substantial and 
reasonably foreseeable effect on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations or a person engaged in such commerce 
in the United States, then the Sherman Act shall apply to such conduct ""only for injury to export business in the United States."" 
15 U.S.C. § 6a. Plaintiffs, however, do not allege that the FTAIA exceptions apply only because of injury to export commerce -- "
1138,," they allege that the foreign conduct had direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects on US commerce. The ""domestic 
injury exception, therefore, is at the center of the parties' dispute."
1138,6," Although a certified copy of the transcript of the hearing on these motions was neither requested by the parties nor prepared by 
the court reporter, the court has referred to the court reporter's rough draft of the hearing to assist its recollection of the oral 
arguments made by the parties. "
1139,7," Briefly, the mechanism by which the high prices were set in the US are that all of Sun's purchases of DRAM from defendants 
were negotiated at a fixed quantity and price, here in California pursuant to one master agreement. The alleged artificially high 
price for DRAM negotiated to finality here in the US was the same price that was used for ""deliveries of DRAM to Sun around the 
globe."" For Unisys' personal computer manufacturing operations, a US team negotiated the price and volume of DRAM, and its 
French facility ordered DRAM at those same prices set by the California procurement team. Similarly, defendants delivered 
DRAM to SGI in Switzerland pursuant to the SGI company-wide price negotiated and implemented in the US."
1139,8," In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., 452 F. Supp. 2d 555 (D. Del. 2006), a case relied upon by defendants, also 
addressed the FTAIA. That court concluded that plaintiff could not show domestic effects because its allegations that Intel 
excluded it from the foreign  [**33] market, which in turn weakened plaintiff domestically involved a chain of events too 
attenuated to constitute direct domestic effects. This case is distinguishable in light of the different type of domestic effects 
alleged here. "
1144,9," According to the plan, the Liquidating Trust Agreement terms trump those of the plan.  [**54] The October 17, 2006 Liquidating 
Trust Agreement, however, limits the transfer of assets to the liquidating trust assets defined in the plan. "
1145,10," By letter dated September 28, 2007, counsel for the trust advised that he had made the requisite request, that certain 
defendants had filed objections, and that the bankruptcy court was expected to place the motion on its calendar. "
1149,*," The Honorable Karen Nelson Moore, Circuit Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. "
1160,1," The Court made clear that Rule 8(a)'s liberal notice pleading standard applied to antitrust actions, Bell Atl., 127 S. Ct. at 1964, 
and not Rule 9's ""'heightened' pleading standard,"" id. at 1973 n.14. "
1161,2," The majority characterizes 3M as a ""market entrant."" Maj. Op. at 14. Given that 3M, as NicSand's only competitor, had 
approximately 33 of the market in 1995, 3M is hardly a ""market entrant."" See Complaint P 8 (""In 1995, NicSand had 
approximately 67 of the DIY [do-it-yourself] retail automotive coated abrasives market."")."
1161,3," According to NicSand's complaint, in addition to providing this up-front payment, 3M also agreed to pay the cost of buying out 
Kmart's stock of NicSand do-it-yourself retail automotive coated abrasives, thus increasing the amount that 3M paid to secure 
Kmart's exclusive business. Complaint P 27. Although buying out a competitor's stock was the traditional practice during annual 
line reviews, it is unclear from the complaint whether 3M also bought out NicSand's remaining stock from the other three big-box 
retailers when it obtained its multi-year exclusive dealing agreements with them. "
1162,4," 3M arrives at this profit margin by first adding NicSand's annual sales and profits from each of the four retailers in the four 
individual years, which amounts to $ 3,594,000 in sales and $ 1,481,000 in profits. 3M then takes the total annual value of its 
four lump-sum payments made in the individual years to be $ 1,285,000 (3M divides its payment to AutoZone in half). 3M then 
subtracts $ 1,285,000 from $ 1,481,000 to arrive at a total profit of $ 196,000, which, when divided by sales  [**54] of $ 
3,594,000, yields a profit margin of approximately 5. Appellee Supp. Br. at 8-9 n.4. "
1163,5," 3M also asks us to make another profits calculation by spreading each of the four payments and profits over two years, which 
would yield a higher profit margin of 16. Appellee Supp. Br. at 8-9 n.4. The majority goes even farther, claiming that under 
another unspecified methodology, NicSand still could have had profit margins of 17-39. Maj. Op. at 15. For the reasons already 
stated above, I believe that in light of the flaws already inherent in the methodology discussed above, any such calculations 
would be excessively speculative at best and would require us to misconstrue NicSand's complaint in 3M's favor."
1163,6," Nor does the complaint state that the retailers were contemplating multi-year contracts or enacting any change in the market. 
All changes in the market were a direct result of 3M's conduct."
1163,7," Any good lawyer knows the value of Post-It Notes and Tabs. See, e.g., LePage's, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 (3d Cir. 
2003)(finding ample evidence that 3M used exclusive agreements to entrench its monopoly over transparent tape); see also N.J. "
1164,," Wood Finishing Co. v. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co., 332 F.2d 346, 348 (3d Cir. 1964) (""3M [is] a highly diversified company, 
manufacturing and selling a number of product lines and segments."")"
1164,8," One commentator has noted that the continuing validity of Indeck as a correct application of the Supreme Court's five-factor 
test has been called into question by later cases.  [**63] See Ronald W. Davis, Standing on Shaky Ground: The Strangely 
Elusive Doctrine of Antitrust Injury, 70 Antitrust L. J. 697, 748 n.184 (2002-2003) (""In . . . Conwood [Co. v. United States 
Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768 (6th Cir. 2002)], the court alluded to no requirement that the plaintiff's snuff had to taste better, or 
cost less, than the defendant monopolist's snuff.""); see also id. at 737-43, 747-48 (criticizing the Sixth Circuit's precedent on the 
question of what a competitor must establish to show antitrust injury). "
1166,9," Neither the Indeck panel nor the majority in this case addressed our precedent's ""necessary predicate"" test for antitrust 
standing. I therefore will not address it in detail. I pause to note only that I believe  [**70] the test is satisfied in this case. The 
""necessary predicate"" test was most recently examined by this court in In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 332 F.3d 896 (6th 
Cir. 2003). There, plaintiffs, purchasers of a particular heart medication, sued the manufacturer of the brand-name version of the 
drug and a manufacturer of a generic version of the drug, alleging that the former agreed to pay the latter $40 million per year to 
delay introduction of its generic version. Defendants made an argument similar to the one that 3M makes here: that plaintiffs 
failed to satisfy the necessary predicate test because even in the absence of the contract, the generic manufacturer could have 
legally and unilaterally delayed introduction of the drug into the market. Id. at 912. The In re Cardizem court rejected this logic, 
explaining that in the prior cases, ""complaints were dismissed for failure to allege antitrust injury because each of the defendants 
had taken an action that it was lawfully entitled to take, independent of the alleged antitrust violation, which was the actual, 
indisputable, and sole cause of the plaintiff's injury."" Id. at 914. The court stated that ""[t]he fact that [defendant]  [**71] could 
have unilaterally, and legally, decided not to bring its generic product to a manifestly profitable market ha[d] no relevance in 
assessing whether the plaintiffs adequately alleged that the antitrust violation was the necessary predicate for their injury."" Id. at 
915. The court further observed: [D]efendants' position, if adopted, risks undermining a basic premise of antitrust law[:] . . . [that] in many instances, an 
otherwise legal action -- e.g. setting a price -- becomes illegal if it is pursuant to an agreement with a competitor. Under the 
defendants' view, such an action would never cause antitrust injury because a defendant could have unilaterally and legally 
set the same price. Id. at 915 n.19. "
1167,," The only issue in this case is whether the exclusive agreements at issue were anticompetitive and whether they injured the 
market under the relevant precedent. Because they were and they did, there is nothing else at issue in this case that suggests 
that 3M took any legal actions that were ""the actual, indisputable, and sole cause of [NicSand]'s injury."" Id. at 914. Accordingly, 
the ""necessary predicate"" test is satisfied here. "
1177,1," ""Ovcon 35 Products"" refers to Warner Chilcott's brand-name Ovcon 35 contraceptive and any AB-related generic equivalents 
(defined, infra, at 4-5) including Balziva-Barr's generic version of Ovcon 35-and Zenchent, a generic version sold by Watson 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Watson"") pursuant to an agreement with Warner Chilcott. "
1178,2," As discussed in greater detail below, Plaintiffs originally proposed a class period from ""April 22, 2004, through the present and 
continuing until the effects of Defendants' anticompetitive conduct have ceased,"" Am. Compl. P 61, but have since proposed the 
amended class period described above."
1178,3," Defendants' Opposition attempts to challenge Plaintiffs' claims that they were direct purchasers of Ovcon 35 during the putative 
class period, but does not demonstrate that any Plaintiff cannot maintain suit as a direct purchaser of Ovcon 35. Specifically, 
Defendants' assertion that Plaintiff American Sales Company, Inc. (""American Sales"") is the distribution arm of grocery chain 
Ahold USA, and ""stopped purchasing Ovcon directly from Warner Chilcott in 2005,"" Defs.' Opp'n at 4, is irrelevant because the 
proposed class period runs from April 22, 2004. With respect to Plaintiffs  [**9] Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc. 
(""Louisiana Wholesale"") and Rochester Drug Co-operative, Inc. (""Rochester Drug""), Defendants attempt to downplay their 
claims, asserting that both made only small purchases of Ovcon 35 directly from Warner Chilcott. Id. These statements, 
however, simply confirm that Louisiana Wholesale and Rochester Drug were direct purchasers of Ovcon 35 during the proposed 
class period. Id. Furthermore, while Defendants claim that Louisiana Wholesale ""also purchased Ovcon from a national 
wholesaler,"" they do not assert that Louisiana Wholesale seeks recovery as an indirect purchaser in this action. Id. Finally, 
Defendants note that Plaintiffs Meijer, Inc. and Meijer Distribution, Inc. (collectively ""Meijer""), Stephen L. LaFrance Holdings, Inc. 
(""LaFrance"") and SAJ Distributors, Inc. (""SAJ"") are indirect purchasers of Ovcon 35, who are suing as assignees of drug 
wholesalers. Id. However, as Defendants themselves admit elsewhere in their Opposition, ""an assignee stands in the shoes of 
his assignor, deriving the same but no greater rights and remedies than the assignor then possessed."" Id. at 28 (quoting Fox-
Greenwald Sheet Metal Co. v. Markowitz Bros., 147 U.S. App. D.C. 14, 452 F.2d 1346,1358 n.69 (D.C. Cir. 1970)).  [**10] It 
therefore appears that Meijer, LaFrance and SAJ may properly assert claims as direct purchasers on behalf of their assignors, 
and that they do not assert claims on their own behalf as indirect purchasers in this action. The Court further notes that in 
addition to the foregoing Plaintiffs, this action was originally brought by Plaintiff Valley Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., which 
was dismissed with prejudice from this action on October 2, 2006. See Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., Civil 
Action No. 05-2195, Stipulation, Docket # 60. "
1181,4," Defendants assert that in resolving the instant motion for class certification, the Court is required to ""conduct an intense factual 
investigation""  [**20] and ""probe the factual and legal underpinnings of each of [Plaintiffs'] claims."" Def.'s Opp'n at 10 (quoting

544 U.S. 949, 125 S. Ct. 1710, 161 L. Ed. 2d 526 (2001)). The Court notes that recent cases cited by Defendants ""question the 
continuing vitality of Eisen by suggesting that courts should make whatever legal and factual inquiries [as] are necessary under 
Rule 23,"" and should resolve factual disputes as required, even if such findings overlap with the merits of the class action.

n.9. The Court does not decide whether to adopt the standard for class certification motions operative in other circuits. Instead, 
the Court  [**21] avoids any inquiry into the merits of Plaintiffs' claims that is not required to resolve the instant motion for class 
certification, and notes that that resolution does not involve significant factual disputes."
1181,5," Plaintiffs assert that the class period correctly closes on December 31, 2006, notwithstanding the fact that Balziva entered the 
market in October 2006, because ""class members suffered overcharges even after Barr began selling generic Ovcon 35."" Pls.' 
Reply at 23 n.34. Defendants have not objected to Plaintiffs' revision, and the Court notes that Plaintiffs' proposed end date 
appears reasonable in light of the nature of their claims."
1181,6," In addition, Plaintiffs' original proposed class definition did not exclude hospitals, universities, and clinics, Am. Compl. P 61; 
however, Plaintiffs opted to remove  [**23] those entities from their revised definition, noting that ""both Plaintiffs and Defendants 
[sic] experts agree [such entities] are not properly in the class"" because they paid significantly less for Ovcon 35. Pls.' Reply at 
23; see also Leitzinger Reb. Decl. at 6-7; Palmer Decl. P 57. "
1183,7," As Defendants themselves stress, SAJ and LaFrance sue as partial assignees of McKesson. See Defs.' Opp'n at 4. The Court 
notes that this assignment undermines Defendants arguments that the named Plaintiffs are not representative of the Big Three. "
1184,8," On April 4, 2006, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Joint Motion for the Establishment of a Plaintiffs' Executive Committee consisting 
of the six law firms that had been retained by the representative Plaintiffs: Berger & Montague,  [**32] P.C.; Boies, Schiller & 
Flexner LLP; Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C.; Garwin, Gerstein & Fisher, L.L.P.; Hagens Berman Sobol & Shapiro 
LLP and Roda Nast, P.C. See Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Company III, Ltd., Civil Action No. 05-2195, Order (D.D.C. 
Apr. 4, 2006). In their Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs request that the law firms serving as the Executive Committee in 
this case be designated as class counsel. Pls.' Mem. at 16. In addition, Plaintiffs note that Linda Nussbaum, counsel for Meijer, 
has recently changed firms from Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. to Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP (""Kaplan Fox""). Id. at 
n.10. Plaintiffs state that Ms. Nussbaum continues to act as counsel for Meijer at her new firm, and request that Kaplan Fox be 
added as a member of the Executive Committee and one of proposed class counsel for this action. Id. Defendants have not 
opposed this request, and the Court shall grant it in the Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion."
1184,9," In addition, the Court notes that Eleventh Circuit's conclusion in Valley Drug was explicitly rejected as inconsistent with Third 
Circuit precedent in In re Hypodermic Product Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, Civil Action No. 05-CV-4465, 2006 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 89353, at *17-20 (D.N.J. Sept. 7, 2006), and that Valley Drug's reasoning was implicitly rejected in In re Relafen Antitrust 
Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 349, 369 (D.Mass. 2004) (rejecting argument that national wholesalers' overcharge claims were limited 
because of generic bypass). "
1185,10," The Court notes that in Phillips v. Klassen, 163 U.S. App. D.C. 360, 502 F.2d 362 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the D.C. Circuit 
 [**37] stated that intra-class conflicts may prevent a finding of adequacy of representation because ""[u]nless the relief sought by 
the particular plaintiffs who bring the suit can be thought to be what would be desired by the other members of the class, it would 
be inequitable to recognize plaintiffs as representative. . . ."" Id. at 366. In that case, however, the relief sought by the named 
plaintiffs could have been beneficial to some class members while detrimental to others. Id. at 366-67. In contrast, in the instant 
case, Balziva and Zenchent have already entered the market, and Plaintiffs seek to recover any overcharges that were paid for 
Ovcon 35. Plaintiffs do not seek relief that could have varied prospective impacts on members of the putative class. Significantly, 
Plaintiffs do not, and obviously cannot, seek to force a generic entry that might be harmful to the pecuniary interests of the Big 
Three."
1185,11," As noted above, the Non-Class Plaintiffs in the Walgreen and CVS matters-other direct purchasers of Ovcon 35 who 
preemptively opted out of this putative class action-filed a joint Memorandum Responding to Defendants' Opposition to Class 
Certification, in which they argue that Defendants'  [**38] Opposition presents an erroneous analysis of the generic bypass 
phenomenon. Although not framed as such, the Non-Class Plaintiffs' Memorandum appears to be in the nature of an amicus 
brief, because it aims at alerting the Court that the generic bypass issue is relevant to the Walgreen and CVS actions as well as 
the instant action. While the Non-Class Plaintiffs should have formally moved to file an amicus brief in this matter, the Court will 
nevertheless consider their Memorandum as such, and shall therefore deny Defendants' Motion to Strike the Non-Class 
Plaintiffs' Memorandum. See Ellsworth Assocs., Inc. v. United States, 917 F. Supp. 841, 846 (D.D.C. 1996) (""The decision 
whether to allow a non-party to participate as an amicus curiae is solely within the broad discretion of the Court""). "
1186,12," Defendants have moved to strike the declarations submitted by Messrs. Factor, Jones, and Flinn, arguing that the declarants 
lack personal knowledge of the facts underlying the statements made in their declarations and are not competent to offer 
opinions regarding the antagonistic economic interests or conflicts within the putative class or Plaintiffs' adequacy as class 
representatives. Defs.' Joint Mot. to Strike Decls. at 2. In addition, Defendants argue that Messrs. Flinn and Jones' declarations 
should be stricken because during their depositions in this matter they refused to answer questions relevant to assertions made 
in their respective declarations regarding the types of contracts their companies use and the factors that influence the prices 
their companies charge for pharmaceutical products. Id. at 2-3, n. 1. Defendants are correct that  [**42] the Messers. Factor, 
Jones, and Flinn's declarations consist mainly of assertions regarding antagonistic economic interests, intra-class conflicts, and 
Plaintiffs' adequacy as class representatives, and that such assertions are legal conclusions rather than factual evidence. 
However, each declaration contains one paragraph-Paragraph 6, quoted above-in which the declarant asserts, on behalf of his 
company, that the company has determined in its business judgment that its interests would be served by the Court allowing this 
action to proceed as a class action with Plaintiffs serving as class representatives. See Factor Decl. P 6; Jones Decl. P 6; Flinn 
Decl. P 6. Those paragraphs, in contrast to the remainder of the declarations, contain factual assertions regarding each 
company's perception of its own self-interest. Corporations must, by necessity, speak through their officers, and each declarant 
is a corporate officer who asserts that he has authority to execute his declaration on behalf of his company. See Factor Decl. P 
1; Jones Decl. P 1; Flinn Decl. P 1. The Court shall therefore grant-in-part and deny-in-part Defendants' [119] Joint Motion to 
Strike the Factor, Jones, and Flinn  [**43] Declarations, shall admit only Paragraphs 1 and 6 of each declaration, and shall strike 
the remainder of each declaration. The Court notes that Messrs. Flinn and Jones' purported refusal to answer questions 
regarding contracts and factors influencing pricing is irrelevant to the paragraphs admitted by the Court."
1186,13," Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Jeffrey J. Leitzinger, and Defendants' expert, Dr. Brian L. Palmer, each arrived at the estimated thirty 
putative class members by excluding from the class those direct purchasers who have joined the Walgreen and CVS actions, 
Valley Drug (which voluntarily withdrew from this litigation), and hospitals, clinics, universities, and government entities, and then 
accounting for common ownership of parent companies and their affiliates and subsidiaries. See Leitzinger Reb. Decl. at 6-7, "
1187,," Palmer Decl. P 57. In his April 12, 2007 Declaration, Defendants' expert, Dr. Palmer, asserts that although there are at most 
twenty-five potential members of the putative class because he has not seen any evidence that five of the thirty potential class 
members either purchased Ovcon 35 at a lower price after the entry of Balziva or purchased Balziva. Palmer Decl. P 58. Dr. 
Leitzinger rebuts Dr. Palmer's assertion, arguing that two of the five direct  [**46] purchasers identified by Dr. Palmer as not 
having purchased Balziva since its entry are not actually members of the putative class because they are based in Puerto Rico, 
that one of the five recently purchased Balziva, and that another one of the five is owned by Cardinal, which has purchased 
Balziva. Leitzinger Reb. Decl. at 13. In addition, Dr. Leitzinger notes that Dr. Palmer's conclusions were based on only four and a 
half months of sales data for Balziva, and did not include sales of Zenchent. Id. at 12. For purposes of the numerosity analysis, 
the Court shall assume that the putative class includes at least 29, and possibly 30, members."
1187,14," The Court notes that when courts in this Circuit have refused to certify small classes, they have done so based on findings that 
other elements of Rule 23(a) were not met, and not solely on a finding that the class lacked numerosity. See, e.g., Marable v. 
District Hospital Partners, L.P., Civil Action 01-02361 (HHK), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62168, 2006 WL 2547992 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 
2006) (refusing to certify class based on lack of numerosity and commonality); International Union, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
64908, 2006 WL 2687005 (refusing to certify class based on numerosity and named plaintiff's failure to  [**47] exhaust 
administrative remedies); Rodriguez v. United States Dept. of Treasury, 131 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. 1990) (same). Here, as discussed 
above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the other requirements of Rule 23(a) are met. "
1188,15," The Court notes that if a significant number of direct purchasers opt out of the proposed class or it becomes apparent that the 
class is, in fact, substantially smaller than thirty, the Court may alter, amend, or decertify the class pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(C). 
See Alvarado Partners, 130 F.R.D. at 675 (certifying class of 33 members but noting ""should underwriters in fact opt out on [a 
large] scale that proceeding as a class is no longer prudent, I can decertify the class."")."
1188,16," In their Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs repeatedly reference the fact that other courts have presumed that common 
questions predominate and that the  [**53] common impact element is met in antitrust cases. See Pls.' Mem. at 20, 23 (citing 
Lumco Indust., Inc. v. Jeld-Wen, Inc., 171 F.R.D. 168, 172 (E.D. Pa. 1997); In re Ampicillin Antitrust Litig., 55 F.R.D. 269, 278 
(D.D.C. 1972)); see also Vitamins, 209 F.R.D. at 266 (citing In re Master Key Antitrust Litig., 528 F.2d 5, 12 n.11 (2d Cir. 1975); 
In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., 193 F.R.D. 162, 166 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Not surprisingly, in their Opposition, Defendants 
challenge the application of any such presumption in this matter. See Defs.' Opp'n at 13-16 (citing, inter alia, In re Polypropylene 
Carpet Antitrust Litig., 178 F.R.D. 603, 620 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (the ""Court cannot presume that, simply because Plaintiffs have 
alleged a national price-fixing conspiracy, Plaintiffs' proof of antitrust impact will be common to all Plaintiffs and will predominate 
at trial."")). No such presumption is required in this case because Plaintiffs have established that common proof will predominate 
over individual issues. "
1190,17," The Court recognizes that if a direct purchaser, in fact, does not purchase a generic version of Ovcon 35 or receive a discount 
on branded Ovcon 35 following generic entry, it may suggest that the direct purchaser would not have done so in Plaintiffs' ""but 
for"" world and thus may not have suffered an overcharge injury. As noted above, it appears that such a scenario applies to at 
most one direct purchaser. Nevertheless, if the evidence ultimately suggests that a putative class member has neither 
purchased a generic version of Ovcon 35 nor received a discount on branded Ovcon 35  [**60] since the entry of generic Ovcon 
35, the Court can accommodate by amending the class definition to exclude such putative class members. "
1191,18," In addition, in his Rebuttal Declaration, Dr. Leitzinger purports to address the challenges to his claim regarding the availability 
of a class-wide damages methodology  [**65] raised by Defendants and their expert, Dr. Palmer. Dr. Leitzinger does so in large 
part by referring the Court to the Expert Report he submitted in this action on May 18, 2007. Defendants have jointly moved to 
strike all references to Dr. Letizinger's May 18, 2007 Expert Report contained in Plaintiffs' Reply Brief and in Dr. Leitzinger's 
Rebuttal Declaration, arguing that the Expert Report presents ""wholly new and previously undisclosed 'expert' testimony and 
conclusions,"" about which Defendants have been unable to question Dr. Leitzinger. See generally Defs.' Joint Mot. to Strike 
[111]. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance on Dr. Leitzinger's Expert Report-served one business day prior to the filing of 
Plaintiffs' Reply brief-constitutes an impermissible attempt to ""save it for the reply."" Id. at 3. Plaintiffs respond that Dr. Leitzinger's 
Expert Report does not constitute previously undisclosed or new arguments or evidence, because the Expert Report ""describes "
1192,," the results obtained by implementing analyses based on the exact same sources of classwide evidence of impact and damages 
and the same methods that Dr. Leitzinger previously identified in his earlier Declaration."" Pls.'  [**66] Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to 
Strike at 1. The Court rejects Defendants' suggestion that the timing of Dr. Leitzinger's Expert Report is in any way suspect, noting that Dr. 
Leitzinger's Expert Report was submitted pursuant to the operative scheduling Order in this matter. Nevertheless, the Court 
agrees with Defendant that the level of detail and analysis contained in Dr. Leitzinger's Expert Report goes far beyond that 
contained in his initial Declaration, and that it would be prejudicial to Defendants for the Court to consider such additional 
evidence and analysis without allowing Defendants the opportunity to respond. HN25[
] ""If the movant raises arguments for the 
first time in his reply to the non-movant's opposition, the court will either ignore those arguments in resolving the motion or 
provide the non-movant an opportunity to respond to those arguments by granting leave to file a sur-reply."" Baloch v. Norton,     
F. Supp. 2d.    , Civil Action No. 03-1207, 517 F. Supp. 2d 345, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70718, , 2007 WL 2774507, *1 n.2 
(D.D.C. Sept. 25, 2007) (citing Ben-Kotel v. Howard Univ., 355 U.S. App. D.C. 82, 319 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C.Cir.2003); Lewis v. 
Rumsfeld, 154 F. Supp. 2d 56, 61 (D.D.C .2001)). Here, the Court shall ignore the analysis and arguments raised  [**67] in Dr. 
Leitzinger's Expert Report, and referenced in his Rebuttal Declaration and Plaintiffs' Reply, to the extent that they go beyond the 
analysis and arguments offered in Dr. Leitzinger's initial Declaration, and shall accordingly grant [111] Defendants' Joint Motion 
to Strike. Nevertheless, as discussed below, the striking of references to Dr. Leitzinger's Expert Report in his Rebuttal 
Declaration and Plaintiffs' Reply does not preclude the Court from concluding that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that a common 
methodology exists for estimating aggregate damages on a class-wide basis."
1192,19," Specifically, Defendants argue that Dr. Leitzinger's proposed methodology is flawed because it assumes facts disproved by 
the evidence in this case, i.e., that a ""source of overcharge"" arises from a decrease in the price of (or the offering of discounts 
on) branded Ovcon 35 upon generic entry and that all class members would purchase generic Ovcon 35 upon entry. Defs.' 
 [**71] Opp'n at 25. However, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have clarified that their overcharge theory does not depend on a 
decrease in the price of Ovcon 35 following generic entry, and it appears that all but one putative class member has purchased 
generic Ovcon 35 following its entry. "
1193,20," Defendants also again raise their argument that individualized defenses preclude the estimation of aggregate damages using 
common proof. Specifically, Defendants raise questions regarding the availability of a ""pass-on"" defense or standing challenge 
against putative class members that Defendants claim used ""cost-plus"" contracts, as well as the validity of certain Plaintiffs' 
assignments of claims by direct purchasing wholesalers. Defs.' Opp'n at 26-29. The Court does not address the merits of these 
alleged defenses herein because even if Defendants are correct as to the availability of such defenses, it does not preclude a 
finding of predominance. See J.B.D.L., 225 F.R.D. at 218 (quoting In re Northwest Airlines Corp., 208 F.R.D. 174, 225 (E.D. 
Mich. 2002) (""It is not necessary, at the class certification stage, for Plaintiffs to show that each and every class member could 
satisfy an individualized standing  [**72] inquiry."")); Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 320-21 (""Even if Plaintiffs could not show injury-in-
fact as to a few class members, this would not be fatal). "
1194,21," Defendants argue that the third factor cited in Rule 23(b)(3)-""the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of 
the claims in the particular forum""-is not significant here because ""defendants' potential liability would be enormous and 
completely out of proportion to any harm suffered by the plaintiffs,"" due to the treble damages and costs of suit available in 
antitrust actions. Defs.' Opp'n at 31 (citing Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1271 (11th Cir. 2004)). Defendants do not cite 
case law from this Circuit indicating that such a consideration dramatically cuts against the use of the class action mechanism 
and, in any event, the Court concludes that concentrating litigation of the putative class members' claims in this Court is 
desirable in light  [**76] of the other actions arising out of Defendants' Agreement currently pending before the Court. "

refuses to rent its venues to other promoters. (Id.) "
1222,7, Complicating the Court's analysis is the fact that none of the parties briefed this issue in any of the motions. 
1223,8," The Court recognizes that the district court in In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (""MTBE"") Prods. Liab. Litig., 241 F.R.D. 185, 193 
(S.D.N.Y. 2007)  [**19] concluded that it was required to apply the law of the transferor circuit in resolving a motion for class 
certification, even though the same district court had previously held that the court was only bound by the law of the transferee 
court in a motion to dismiss in the same case. Escambia County Utilities Authority v. Amerada Hess Corp. (In re Methyl Tertiary 
Butyl Ether Prods. Liab. Litig.), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 753, 2005 WL 106936 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2005). However, this Court is 
not bound by MTBE and the reasoning of MTBE is unpersuasive for several reasons. The MTBE court reasoned that the Supreme Court's decision in Lexecon v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 
26, 118 S. Ct. 956, 140 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1998) undermined the Second Circuit's decision in Menowitz v. Brown, which held that the 
law of the transferee circuit applied in a MDL. MTBE, 241 F.R.D. at 191-92. In Lexecon, the Supreme Court held that transferee 
courts were prohibited from retaining § 1407 cases for trial through a self-transfer under § 1404. 523 U.S. at 40. The Court held 
that § 1407 required the transferee court to remand all cases to the transferor courts at the conclusion of pretrial proceedings. Id. 
The MTBE court found that Lexecon undercut the reasoning of Menowitz. The MTBE court is correct that one  [**20] rationale offered in support of applying the law of the transferee circuit was that the 
vast majority of cases were resolved prior to trial or otherwise self-transferred under § 1404 to the transferee court for joint trial. 
See, e.g., In re Korean Airlines, 829 F.2d at 1176-86 (D.H. Ginsburg, J., concurring). This rationale is undermined by Lexecon. 
However, as explained above, decisions such as In re Korean Airlines have offered numerous other rationales for applying the 
law of, the transferee circuit such as the reduction in efficiency of forcing a court to apply divergent interpretations of governing 
federal law and the logical inconsistency of requiring one judge to apply simultaneously different and conflicting interpretations of 
what is supposed to be a unitary federal law. 829 F.2d at 1173-76. The Ninth Circuit relied on In re Korean Airlines, rather than 
the rationale undermined by Lexecon. Newton, 22 F.3d at 1460 (""[I]n resolving an identical question under 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the 
D.C. Circuit correctly pointed out that '[b]inding precedent for all [courts] is set only by the Supreme Court, and for the district 
courts within a circuit, only by the court of appeals for that circuit  [**21] [in the absence of Supreme Court authority].') (quoting In 
re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 829 F.2d at 1176 ). Therefore, the Court concludes that Newton's holding continues to control 
because the reasoning of In re Korean Airlines is not undermined by Lexecon. Second, the MBTE court reasoned that ""[i]t would be neither just nor efficient to apply the law of this Circuit in considering class 
certification, and then force the transferor court to try a class action that it might never have certified."" 241 F.R.D. at 193. 
However, the D.C. Circuit rejected this argument in In re Korean Airlines and explained that forcing the transferor court to apply 
the law of the transferee court promotes efficiency: Should the several cases consolidated for pretrial preparation in the instant proceeding eventually return to transferor 
courts outside this circuit, would our district court's Warsaw Convention/Montreal Agreement ruling, which we have 
affirmed, have binding force? We believe it should, as ""law of the case,"" for if it did not, transfers under 28 U.S.C. § 1407 
could be counterproductive, i.e., capable of generating rather than reducing the duplication and protraction Congress 
sought to check.  [**22] . . . On this issue in the case at hand, however, our circuit is not positioned to speak the last word."

1245,24," Phillips also explains that the fact that products have low price-elasticities does not necessarily mean that two products have a 
low cross-elasticity of demand. Phillips provides the following example to illustrate this distinction. (Phillips Rebuttal Report at 6-
7.) First, Phillips assumes that there are two types of rock bands, type A and type B. (Id. at 6.) Second, Phillips assumes that 
type A bands sell 1000 tickets per year in a geographic region and type B bands sell 500 tickets per year in the same geographic 
region. (Id. at 6-7.) Next, Phillips assumes that A's ticket prices are raised by 5% and this causes 40 ticket buyers from type A's 
bands to decide to attend a type B concert instead. (Id. at 7.) Phillips notes that this results in a cross-price elasticity of 1.6. (Id.) 
Phillips explains that this is a ""reasonably high"" cross-price elasticity which indicates that the two band types should be in the 
same market. (Id.) Phillips emphasizes that the cross-price elasticity is reasonably high even though the price elasticity of group 
A is sufficiently  [**104] low that group A can raise its price without a significant loss in sales. (Id.) "

1248,28," The Court also holds that individual issues would not predominate even if delineating the boundaries of a ""rock"" market 
involved deciding whether various fringe artists should be properly categorized as rock. In Nobody in Particular Presents 
 [**117] case, Clear Channel similarly argued that a jury would have difficulty distinguishing between rock and non-rock 
concerts, especially with regard to certain fringe artists such as Jewel and Sheryl Crow. 311 F. Supp. 2d at 1090. The district 
court rejected this argument: Just as ""customers know a department store when they see it,"" customers know a rock concert when they hear it, as will 
the jury. [Bon-Ton Stores v. May Dep't Stores Co., 881 F. Supp. 860, 870 (W.D.N.Y. 1994)] That HN54[
] the outer edge 
of a market's boundaries are a disputed does not mean the market is legally flawed for purposes of a motion for summary "

question of boundaries is most properly answered by the jury."
1249,311," F. Supp. 2d at 1090. The Court finds this reasoning persuasive. Moreover, to the extent an individual analysis would be required to determine 
whether fringe artists fell within the market definition, common questions of law and fact establishing the definition in general 
would predominate over questions concerning such fringe artists."
1249,29, Defendants do not argue that this factor would involve substantial individual questions of law or fact.

1255,36," Although Plaintiffs' theory is not always precisely articulated, it appears to be as follows. First, all rock concerts fall within a 
single product market and are reasonable substitutes. Second, in a competitive market with multiple promoters, a promoter 
cannot charge supracompetitive ticket prices because consumer demand will shift to other concerts and the promoter would lose "
1256,," revenue. Consequently, promoters would not cede to an artist's demand to charge supracompetitive ticket prices because 
promoters would be better off charging a competitive price for an artist that is a substitute. However, Plaintiffs allege that Clear 
Channel possesses monopoly power and therefore Clear Channel can set supracompetitive prices. In other words, by 
eliminating competing promoters, ticket prices for rock concerts are no longer constrained."
1256,37," A district court rejected a similar argument in J.B.D.L. Corp.. 225 F.R.D. at 218. In J.B.D.L. Corp., purchasers of a prescription 
drug brought an antitrust class action against the drug manufacturer alleging restraint of trade and monopolization. Id. at 210. As 
discussed above, plaintiffs' expert claimed that  [**147] antitrust impact could be demonstrated on a class-wide basis through the 
use of common evidence and methodologies. Id. at 217-18. The defendants argued that the impact analysis involved individual 
questions because some purchasers negotiated discounts and thus class members paid different prices for the drug. Id. 
Applying a rationale similar to the Court's reasoning, the court rejected the defendants' argument: [T]he fact that some direct purchasers may have purchased Premarin at a price achieved through individual negotiations 
does not affect the common impact analysis because [defendant's] alleged anticompetitive conduct artificially raised the 
base price for Premarin on which discounts were based. Thus, any variation in the price actually paid for Premarin by the 
sundry direct purchasers is really a matter of calculation of individual damages as opposed to evidence showing that impact 
of the alleged anticompetitive conduct was not common among direct purchasers. Id. at 218. See also In re Bromine Antitrust Litigation, 203 F.R.D. 403, 414-415 (S.D. Ind. 2001) (finding that defendant's 
""arguments that substantial buyer power and variation in prices preclude finding that common issues  [**148] predominate is a 
red herring"")."
1256,38," There is a substantial dispute over the extent to which rock concerts sell-out. Gilbert states that 27% of the tickets purchased 
for rock concerts promoted by Clear Channel during the class period were for sold-out concerts. (Gilbert Report PP 51,53.) 
However, Plaintiffs have produced evidence that sell-outs are relatively rare occurrences. For example, Clear Channel's ""Music 
Division Strategic Plan for July 2002 states that the total number of Clear Channel amphitheatre sellouts dropped to 139 in 2001 
from 213 in 2000. (Pl'.s Supp. Ex. 1. LW 00-1267.) The plan also states that the ""large majority of [Clear Channel] shows are not 
sell-outs.""  [**149] (Pl.'s Supp. Ex. 1. LN 001313.)"
1256,39," a perfectly competitive market, the aggregate supply curve represents the sum of the individual firms' marginal cost curves, 
and the aggregate demand curve represents total market demand. The equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the 
aggregate supply and demand curves. This equilibrium price becomes the marginal revenue curve for each firm because each 
firm is a price taker. Because firms select an output where marginal costs equal marginal revenue, price equals marginal cost at 
the equilibrium level of output in a competitive market. In other words, price = MR = MC. See Lipsey, Richard G. et al., 
Microeconomics, 232-36 (12th ed. 1998). "
1257,40," While both monopolists and competitive firms  [**150] select an output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, price 
does not equal marginal cost for a monopolist. This is due to the fact that as the sole producer, a monopolist's demand curve is 
the market demand curve for the product. As a result, a monopolist faces negatively sloped demand and marginal revenue 
curves while a perfectly competitive firm faces a constant marginal revenue curve. While the monopolist selects a level of output 
where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, the price is determined by the intersection of this level of output and the demand 
curve. Therefore, a monopolists' marginal revenue and marginal cost is less than the price at which it sells its output. Lipsey, 
supra, at 232-36."
1257,41," Defendants contest the allegation that Clear Channel controls selection of the venue. For example, the vice president of 
booking for Southern California for Live Nation states that ""the artist makes the final choice on venue"" and explains that ""Most 
artists know the venues available in Los Angeles and have very strong ideas about the ones that they like and the ones in which 
they will not play."" (Best Decl. P 9.) "

1261,45," The district court in Knutson summarized the rationale for imposing a lower burden of proof on the amount of damages: HN69[
] There are two reasons why plaintiff's burden of proving the amount of damages is relaxed in an antitrust case: 
first, the self-evident intangible nature of the subject matter; and second, the recognition that most difficulties in computing 
antitrust damages arise as a result of defendant's own wrongful conduct. . . [If Defendants were] permitted to argue that 
inexact and imprecise damages are improper . . . potential defendants would be encouraged to act in a manner that would 
render damages as uncertain and speculative as possible, and this would of course undercut the policies

1268,49," Defendants are allegedly able to pass on these higher costs to consumers because the elasticity of demand for individual 
artists is low. As discussed in Part V, the fact that the elasticity of demand for individual artists is low doe's not mean that the 
price cross-elasticity between artists is low. As a result, the fact that Defendants can pass on the higher costs to consumers 
does not compel the conclusion that each artist constitutes a distinct product market."
1268,50," Defendants cite a number of other district court opinions from other circuits denying standing to consumers for attempted 
monopolization claims, some with virtually no analysis of the scheme at issue. Wojcieszek v. New England Telephone and 
Telegraph Company, 977 F. Supp. 527, 535 (D. Mass. 1997); Simpson v. U.S. West Communications, Inc., 957 F. Supp. 201,

Co., 669 F. Supp 217, 222-24 (N.D. Ill. 1987). However, to the extent these opinions deny standing to consumers as a matter of 
course, they rely on the assumption that a defendant cannot engage in supracompetitive pricing until they have achieved "
1269,," monopoly power. As already noted, this is not necessarily true due to the unique circumstances of this case. At the same time, in 
Davis v. Pacific Bell, 204 F. Supp. 2d 1236, 1241 (N.D. Cal. 2002), a federal  [**198] district court found antitrust standing for 
consumers making an attempted monopolization claim on the basis of injuries arising both from anticompetitive practices 
directed at consumers and from the charging of supracompetitive prices enabled by those practices. See also Strong v. 
Bellsouth Telecoms., Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21450, 1994 WL1016699, at *3 (W.D. La. 1994) (noting that ""consumers may 
have standing""). Defendants argue that these cases are distinguishable because the harm to the consumers resulted, in part, 
directly from the defendant phone companies' anticompetitive conduct. However, in neither opinion was there any indication that 
consumers' suffering of direct harm from defendants' anticompetitive practices was dispositive in the overall finding of antitrust 
standing. Thus, these cases demonstrate that HN91[
] the issue of consumer standing is not subject to a per se rule, but 
instead a case-by-case determination."
1269,51," Defendants claim this factor ""weighs 'heavily' against Plaintiffs' standing to bring suit."" (Def. Mot. at 11). However, the opinion 
cited for this proposition is in fact describing the relative weight of four factors when using the term ""heavily"" rather than only this 
factor. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 545. There is no indication that this factor has any special weight in the 
antitrust standing analysis. "
1270,52," Plaintiffs also argued that they have standing because they are seeking injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act. The 
Court need not reach this issue because the Court finds that standing exists for the reasons discussed above. Additionally, 
Plaintiffs have represented that they are no longer pursuing a claim for injunctive relief because Defendants have spun-off their 
concert promotion business into an independent, publicly traded entity named Live Nation, Inc.. (Def.'s Reply at 11.)"
1270,53," The Court also notes that the result might have been vastly different if the MDL panel had selected a district court in a different 
circuit to serve as the MDL court. For example, if the MDL panel had assigned the cases to the Southern District of New York, 
the district court could have engaged in a more probing analysis of the Rule 23 factors pursuant to In re IPO Securities Litig. "

1275,1," The complaint alleges that Tilcon is a subsidiary of Oldcastle, which is a subsidiary of CRH. The defendants contend that 
Oldcastle was never served with a complaint, has therefore never made an appearance in this action, and is not a party to this 
appeal. Oldcastle joined the motion to dismiss, and the district court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants. Oldcastle 
does not move to dismiss this appeal, and in view of our affirmance of the dismissal, we need not belabor the point."

are now tested under the rule of reason. Khan, 522 U.S. at 22; Leegin, 127 S. Ct. at 2720. "
1278,6," In fact, counsel asserted at oral argument that the opposite was true-that Tilcon had cut prices to customers (other than Port 
Dock) to below cost. However, examination of the complaint shows that the one episode of below-cost pricing was alleged to 
have occurred in connection with a 1991 dispute between Tilcon and Port Dock, rather than to have occurred after Tilcon 
acquired its production monopoly. After acquiring its monopoly, Tilcon is alleged to  [**14] have increased prices to its remaining 
customers (but not Port Dock), as one would expect it to do. To the extent that Port Dock relies on predatory pricing alleged to have happened in 1991, it appears on the face of the 
complaint that any possible claim would be barred by the four-year statute of limitations. 15 U.S.C. § 15b. "
1282,1," In 1953, the Small Business Act was enacted into law to ""aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as possible, the interests of

1282,3," Because LDI's complaint conflates the acts of VT Griffin with its predecessor, Jones, it is not always apparent which entity is 
accused of committing what acts at any given time. Unfortunately, LDI does not explain why VT Griffin is responsible for Jones' 
acts, or how certain parts of the alleged conspiracy predate VT Griffin's acquisition of the Kings Bay prime contract. "
1284,4," Although LDI denominates this claim as ""collusion"" in its complaint, it refers to it as a ""civil conspiracy"" claim in its brief in 
opposition to VT Griffin's motion to dismiss. Defendants could not locate any case law describing the essential elements of a civil 
cause of action for collusion, and the Court cannot either. See William L. Prosser & W. Page Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on 
Torts 324 (5th ed. 1984) (describing conspiracy liability in tort generally). "
1286,5," Horizontal restraints on trade are made between competitors, and vertical restraints are between businesses concentrated in 
different areas of production and distribution in the same business, such as a manufacturer and retailer of a particular good. See 
Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns., 376 F.3d 1065, 1071 (11th Cir. 2004). By virtue of the Supreme 
Court's reexamination of the economic principles underlying vertical restraints, and a steady chipping  [*17] away at the rule that 
once held vertical restraints to be per se illegal, all vertical restraints, including vertical price restraints, are now judged according 
to the rule of reason. Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc., 168 L. Ed. 2d at 643-47. "

1289,9," VT Griffin argues that it is unclear whether LDI is asserting a conspiracy to monopolize claim because it's allegations are vague 
and conclusory. The Court does not read Plaintiff's complaint as stating either a ""conspiracy to monopolize"" or an ""attempt to 
monopolize"" claim, and Plaintiff does not urge such claims in its response in opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss. "

appear in four separate paragraphs. (See id., 22, 24-26; First Amended Complaint, P 18.) Although the wording is slightly 
different, these paragraphs allege that the Group of 10: (1) actively combated alternative disc formats (Second Amended 
Complaint, P 22); (2) used its combined market power to compel content providers to invest in and commit to using discs that 
complied with the DVD standard (id., P 24);(3) ensured that no content was available in alternative disc formats, thereby 
coercing consumers to buy DVD standard compliant video disc players (id., P 25); and (4) precluded competitors from selling

pay royalties to the Group of 10 to compete in the relevant market (id., P 26.) "

1299,50, Id. at 23.
1299,51," In its opposition and again at oral argument, Norcent attempted to reargue an issue previously decided by the court, i.e., 
whether the standard setting in which defendants engaged, without more, could constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade. 
Norcent sought to distinguish API, arguing that the standard there at issue was akin to a Good Housekeeping ""seal of approval,"" 
and thus different from the standard being challenged in this case, which incorporates elements of patented technology owned 
by defendants and requires that companies wishing to manufacture standard-compliant video disc players pay royalties to 
standard-setting patent holders. The court is not persuaded. The available case law does not indicate that, by itself, setting such 
a standard constitutes an antitrust violation. In Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 
365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961), the Supreme Court held that Radiant Burners had stated a Sherman Act claim by alleging that the 
American Gas Association (""AGA""), which tested gas burners and affixed a ""seal of approval"" to those that passed the tests, 
refused to approve Radiant's burners, and thereafter conspired with certain of its  [*27] members to ensure that they would not 
provide gas for the burners. See id. at 658. In Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 
100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988), the Court held that competitors in the electrical conduit industry violated the antitrust laws by packing 
the annual membership meeting of a private standard-setting organization whose standards were routinely adopted into law by 
state and local governments, and causing those present to vote to disapprove another company's product. See id. at 507 (""Nor 
can the Association's Code be characterized as merely an exercise of the power of persuasion, for it involves the exercise of 
market power""); see also id. at 497 (""Petitioner conceded that it had conspired with the other steel interests to exclude 
respondent's product from the Code and that it had a pecuniary interest to do so""). Similarly in American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers v. Hydrolevel, 456 U.S. 556, 102 S. Ct. 1935, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1982), the Court held that an industry-wide standard-
setting organization violated the antitrust laws by allowing one competitor in the industry to interpret its code to the detriment of 
another. See id. at 572. In each of these cases, the Court found an antitrust violation  [*28] because an established industry-wide standard-setting 
process was abused or manipulated. In each, there was an allegation that an industry-wide standard-setting organization had 
been coopted by one or more members of the industry in an anti-competitive way. Norcent does not allege that the Group of 10 
abused an industry-wide standard-setting process. Rather, it argues that members of the Group of 10 came together to create a 
standard and successfully promoted it. None of the cases on which Norcent relies holds, or even intimates, that such behavior is 
prohibited. Rather, as the court found in its prior orders, private action of this type does not give rise to a Sherman Act claim 
absent proof of coercion. The final case Norcent cited at argument was Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297 (3d Cir. 2007). There, the Third 
Circuit held that a patent holder's intentionally false promise to license its technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory 
terms, on which a standard-determining organization's (""SDO"") relied in including the technology in an industry-wide standard, "
1300,," constituted ""actionable antitrust conduct."" See id. at 314 (""Deception in a consensus-driven private standard-setting 
 [*29] environment harms the competitive process by obscuring the costs of including proprietary technology in a standard and 
increasing the likelihood that patent rights will confer monopoly power on the patent holder""). Like the other decisions cited by 
Norcent, Qualcomm is inapposite. Although the case also involves the licensing of patents on technology included in an industry-
wide standard, Norcent has not alleged that any member of the Group of 10 misrepresented its willingness to license its patents. 
Nor has it alleged that the patented technology was included in an industry-wide standard. In sum, Norcent has advanced no 
argument that causes the court to change its view that there was nothing inherently anti-competitive about the standard-setting 
activity in which the Group of 10 engaged."
1300,52, Id. at 23-24.
1300,53," Norcent's new allegations and dates regarding the standard setting meetings in Tokyo may add specificity, but do not support 
the inference that the Group of 10 entered into an illegal agreement. To transform facially legitimate standard-setting and 
licensing into an antitrust violation, Norcent must allege facts indicating that the purpose of the activity was to restrain trade. See

1302,65," This is especially true because, as noted, the relevant market identified by Norcent is the market for DVD players. It is not 
clear how the Group of 10's purported decision to sell nothing but DVD players could have restrained other producers from 
participating in the DVD market. While the decision to focus only on DVD technology might conceivably have had an impact on 
the market for competing technologies, or the market for all video disc players, that is not the relevant market Norcent has 
alleged in its complaint."
1302,66," Norcent alleges that the Group of 10 met in Tokyo in 1995, and that there have been subsequent meetings. (Second 
Amended Complaint, P 17.) It does not specifically assert that the alleged agreement was made at these meetings, however."
1302,67," Norcent identifies a handful of executives who met to set the DVD standard. (See id., P 18.) It does not specifically allege that 
these executives agreed not  [*40] to sell non-DVD video disc players, however."
1302,68," Norcent alleges that ""Philips has previously embraced the fact that such an agreement actually exists, saying:  [*41] 'As the 
Complaint . . . states, in 1996, Philips and a number of other companies that developed DVD technology published a set of 
technical standards to promote the manufacture and sale of compatible DVD players and discs.""' (Pl.'s Opp. at 3 (quoting 
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Complaint, filed March 5, 2007 at 1).) This 
does not constitute an admission that defendants agreed not to manufacture non-DVD video disc players. Rather, it is entirely 
consistent with defendants' contention that any agreement among the Group of 10 was an agreement to set and promote 
standards, and not an agreement to restrict competition. "
1303,69," See Def.'s Mem. at 5. Proof that members of the Group of 10 never sold non-DVD video players would be the most obvious 
type of parallel conduct related to the alleged agreement. As noted, parallel conduct may arise from legitimate and legal 
business decisionmaking. See Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1964 (""Even 'conscious parallelism,' a common reaction of 'firms in a 
concentrated market [that] recogniz[e] their  [*42] shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and 
output decisions' is 'not in itself unlawful,""' quoting Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 
113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993))."
1303,70," The Court stated that before allegations of parallel conduct would support a § 1 claim, they had to ""be placed in a context that 
raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action."" 
Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1966. This is necessary in order to avoid commencing litigation over ""merely parallel conduct that could 
just as well be independent action."" Id."
1303,71," Norcent raises the novel argument that the application of Twombly's factual context requirement would preclude actions 
against conspirators who ""are good at planning and keeping secrets."" (See Pl.'s Opp. at 2.) The Supreme Court has clearly held, 
however, that a plaintiff must meet the ""plausibility"" threshold, no matter how well the defendants concealed their actions. The 
Court has made the decision, as a matter of policy, that it is better to require a factual basis before allowing costly litigation to 
proceed than it is to permit plaintiffs to commence  [*43] discovery without stating facts supporting their claims. See Twombly, 
127 S. Ct. at 1966-67 (""it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery . . . but 
quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive""). Justice Stevens' dissent highlights this as a 
point of disagreement. See id. at 1976 (""Under the relaxed pleading standards of the Federal Rules, the idea was not to keep 
litigants out of court but rather to keep them in. The merits of a claim would be sorted out during a flexible pretrial process and, 
as appropriate through the crucible of trial"" (Stevens, J., dissenting)). In the face of clear guidance from the Supreme Court, 
Norcent cannot escape Twombly's requirements by arguing that they were prevent some meritorious cases from advancing."
1303,72," Norcent appears to ignore Twombly in its opposition. It claims that ""standing alone, the agreement not to offer product 
variations could itself constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade."" (See Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss 
Second Amended Complaint (""Pl.'s Opp."") at 6.) Under Twombly, this is true only if Norcent provides factual context that makes 
it plausible such an agreement was actually made. See Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2007) (""we believe the 
Court is not requiring a universal standard of heightened fact pleading, but is instead requiring a flexible ""plausibility 
 [*45] standard,"" which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such 
amplification is needed to render the claim plausible""(emphasis original)); see also TON Servs. v. Qwest Corp., 493 F.3d 1225, 
1236 (10th Cir. 2007) (""In Bell Atlantic, the Supreme Court articulated a new 'plausibility' standard under which a complaint must 
include 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,""' citing Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1974); Brown v. 
Kerkhoff, 504 F. Supp. 2d 464, 522 (S.D. Iowa 2007) (reviewing the Second and Tenth Circuit's interpretations of Twombly and 
anticipating that the Eighth Circuit would hold that ""[t]he merits of the claim need not be such that the plaintiff plausibly succeeds; 
the claim must merely be supported with enough factual fodder that the claim can plausibly be proven. This standard may 
require a plaintiff to place allegations 'in a context that raises a suggestion of unlawful conduct, such that the plaintiff's 
allegations hurdle the line 'between the factually neutral and the factually suggestive,""' citing Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1966 & n. 5). "
1304,73," Norcent suggested at oral argument that the court  [*46] had misinterpreted the significance of this new allegation. It asserted 
that it had not shifted the focus of its allegations from coercion to agreement. Rather, it contended, the agreement it had pled 
constituted contextual evidence of coercion. The alleged agreement does not demonstrate coercion any more than the 
allegations contained in Norcent's prior complaints. Stated differently, the agreement not to produce non-standard compliant 
video disc players, without more, is not inherently coercive because it does not, on its face, bind anyone outside the Group of 10."
1304,74," Second Amended Complaint, P 28."
1304,75, Id. 
1305,76," At the hearing, Norcent raised an new argument regarding the illegality of the Group of 10's licensing scheme. It asserted that 
members of the Group of 10 favored other members because they did not charge each other royalties. This amounts to an 
argument that patent pools are inherently anti-competitive. Such an argument is at odds with well-established law. See U.S. 
Philips Corp. v. International Trade Com'n, 424 F.3d 1179, 1193 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding that packaged  [*50] licensing has pro-
competitive purposes and is not per se violative of the Sherman Act); see also Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting 
System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 20, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (""The blanket license, as we see it, is not a 'naked restrain[t]' 
of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition,"" quoting White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S. Ct. 
696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963)). The fact that members of the Group of 10 do not charge each other royalties is permissible. As 
defendants noted at oral argument, the patent pools at issue here resemble barter agreements in which patent holders trade the 
use of licenses to each other in lieu of paying royalties. The fact that there are three pools does not change this analysis. Each 
member of the Group of 10 is permitted to trade the use of its license in return for the right to use another member's license, and 
in this manner take advantage of the benefits of its research and development activities."
1305,77," Pl.'s Opp. at 8. Norcent made this claim in response to defendants' citation of two web postings that might constitute the 
""announcement"" alleged in the complaint. One of the postings is an answer to a frequently asked question on the DFLLC's 
website, which states that ""[t]he use of the DVD Format for products that do not conform to the Specifications is a violation of the 
DVD Format/Logo License. Such violation may lead to termination of the License."" (Def.'s Mem. at 6-7 n. 5, citing 
http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/faq.html).) The other reference defendants proffer is a portion of the publicly available DVD Format/Logo, 
which provides that the use of the DVD logo except in connection with authentic DVD players is a material breach of the 
agreement. (Id. at 7 n. 5, citing http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/pdf/LicenseAgreement Draft.pdf). In  [*53] both of these references, the 
Group of 10 threatens only to revoke the license of a licensee who uses the DVD logo on non-conforming products. As noted, 
there is nothing improper about such a practice. "

1306,84, Id.
1306,85, The court stated: 
1307,," ""Norcent alleges that prices in the market have plateaued at supra-competitive levels because members of the Group of 10 
exercise an unfair competitive advantage by demanding royalties and otherwise enforcing their patents. It asserts that they 
are able to demand royalties not simply because they own patents, but also because the Group of 10 has combined to set 
an industry standard  [*58] for DVDs that ensures competitors must license the patents to compete effectively in the market 
and submarket. Whether or not such conduct is actionable under § 1 of the Sherman Act is a different question, which is 
addressed supra. There is no doubt, however, that the averments sufficiently state a causal link between defendants' 
alleged conduct -- conduct that, as currently alleged, does not constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade -- and the 
alleged supra-competitive prices being paid by consumers. Consequently, the court concludes that Norcent has adequately 
pleaded injury to competition."" (August 3, 2007 Order at 21-22.) "
1308,86," As noted, Norcent asserted at the hearing that it had not ""shifted focus"" by including these new allegations. To the extent the 
allegations are intended to provide support for Norcent's coercion claim, they are insufficient for the reasons stated earlier. 
Consequently, it is appropriate to examine whether Norcent has alleged that the purported agreement and threats are causally 
linked to the injury to competition it asserts. "
1309,87," Noting that Norcent's second amended complaint alleges that the DFLLC was formed in 2000, defendants contend that it is 
now clear on the face of the complaint that Norcent's § 1claim is barred by the Sherman Act's four year statute of limitations. 
(See Def.'s Mem. at 12.) Defendants concede that Norcent alleges ""an ongoing combination"" and meetings ""continuing into the 
present."" They argue, however, that the real injury alleged is the Group of 10's initial standard-setting activity, and that there is 
no reason to believe that the ""continuing collaborations were material to the exclusion of alternative[ technologies] that is the 
gravamen of the [second amended complaint]."" (Def.'s Mem. at 13.) ""A cause of action in antitrust accrues each time a plaintiff is 
injured by an act of the defendant and the statute of limitations runs from  [*66] the commission of the act."" Pace Industries, Inc. 
v. Three Phoenix Co., 813 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing Zenith Radio Corp., 401 U.S. at 338, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L.Ed. 2d 
77). ""Even when a plaintiff alleges a continuing violation, an overt act by the defendant is required to restart the statute of 
limitations and the statute runs from the last overt act."" Id.(citing Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, 232 F.2d 190, 
195 (9th Cir. 1956)). Although Norcent has failed to allege sufficiently any illegal conduct by defendants, to the extent it asserts 
that the Group of 10 is violating the antitrust laws by implementing its licensing regime, it pleads ongoing acts that contribute to 
ongoing sales at purportedly supra-competitive prices. See Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 189, 117 S. Ct. 1984, 138 
L. Ed. 2d 373 (1997) (""in the case of a 'continuing violation,' say, a price-fixing conspiracy that brings about a series of unlawfully 
high priced sales over a period of years, 'each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff,' e.g., each sale to 
the plaintiff, 'starts the statutory period running again, regardless of the plaintiffs knowledge of the alleged illegality at much 
earlier times""' (citations omitted)).  [*67] The court thus disagrees that Norcent's new allegations make clear that its § 1 claim is 
barred by the statute of limitations. Because the complaint alleges that overt acts have continued through the present, the 
complaint pleads ongoing injury. Because Norcent has failed adequately to allege that defendants have unreasonably restrained 
trade, however, the court need not finally decide this issue. "
1311,1," At the close of briefing, plaintiff filed a second, largely redundant motion, styled ""Plaintiff's Motion for Issuance of a Preliminary 
Injunction"" (doc. 32). Given the identity of legal standards for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, such 
requests are almost always combined in a single motion. For reasons that are unclear, plaintiff elected to file them separated by 
several days, resulting in complications to the briefing process, as discussed herein. In any event, that Motion  [*2] is also ripe 
for disposition. "
1312,2," In its Opposition Brief, MAWSS asserted that the requested preliminary injunction relief was broader in scope than that 
requested by the Application for TRO. This is not correct. Side-by-side comparison of the relief sought by the Application for 
TRO and that sought by the Motion for Preliminary Injunction reveals that they are co-extensive, except that of course the TRO 
would be temporary while the Preliminary Injunction would remain in place until a final ruling on the merits. Compare  [*7] doc. 
28, P 66 with doc. 32, PP 2-4."
1312,3," The Court takes these matters under submission without an evidentiary hearing. The law is clear that a hearing is required on 
motions for TRO or preliminary injunction only if there are contested issues of fact that require credibility determinations. See 
Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, B.V. v. Consorcio Barr, S.A., 320 F.3d 1205, 1211 (11th Cir. 2003) (observing that an 
""evidentiary hearing is not always required before the issuance of a preliminary injunction"" unless ""facts are bitterly contested 
and credibility determinations must be made to decide whether injunctive relief should issue"") (citations omitted); Cumulus 
Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 304 F.3d 1167, 1178 (11th Cir. 2002) (opining that where little dispute exists 
as to raw facts, and dispute revolves around inferences to be drawn from such facts, it is left to district court's sound discretion to 
determine whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary by balancing the interests of speed and practicality against those of 
accuracy and fairness). Review of the parties' submissions reveals no material disputes as to raw facts and no bitter contest of 
facts that must  [*8] be resolved antecedent to a ruling on the Rule 65 motions; rather, it appears that plaintiff's motions turn on 
purely legal questions relating to the sufficiency of its evidentiary submission. Accordingly, the Court finds, after balancing the 
interests of speed and practicality against those of accuracy and fairness, that no hearing is needed here. "
1313,4," Those four basic elements are as follows: ""1) that there are two separate products, a 'tying' product and a 'tied' product; 2) that 
those products are in fact 'tied' together - that is, the buyer was forced to buy the tied product to get the tying product; 3) that the 
seller possesses sufficient economic power in the tying product market to coerce buyer acceptance of the tied product; and 4) 
involvement of a 'not insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce in the market of the tied product."" Thompson v. Metropolitan 
Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566, 1574 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted)."
1313,5," That said, MCWSFPA's showing on the coercion  [*11] prong of the per se tying claim appears inadequate to carry its burden. 
The Eleventh Circuit has specifically looked to and required evidence of actual coercion of customers being actually forced to 
change their purchasing patterns to select the tied product (i.e., evidence concerning whether the customers would have 
purchased the tied product anyway). See Thompson, 934 F.2d at 1577-78 (denying summary judgment to defendant on antitrust 
claims where plaintiff proffered substantial evidence that individuals had quit or refused to join plaintiff's professional association 
because of tying behavior from defendant). MCWSFPA has submitted no evidence of actual coercion of customers (i.e., that any 
specific customer who would have bought water from MCWSFPA was compelled to buy it from MAWSS instead because of the 
latter's hardball tying tactics). Instead, plaintiff simply argues that Thompson (which plaintiff does not mention by name in this 
section of its brief, but which is presumably the case to which plaintiff is referring) was wrongly decided in this regard, given the 
statements in a leading treatise on antitrust law that a party's mere announcement of a tying condition to a buyer is 
 [*12] sufficient to establish coercion. See X Phillip E. Areeda et al., X Antitrust Law, § 1754e (2nd ed. 2003). Of course, the 
Court does not have the luxury of discarding binding precedent in favor of treatises; therefore, plaintiff must satisfy the 
Thompson coercion standard because that decision remains good law in this Circuit. Plaintiff's failure to proffer evidence of 
actual coercion as required by Thompson amounts to a failure to show substantial likelihood of success as to its tying claim."
1313,6," The focus of that inquiry is whether ""the nexus between the State and [MAWSS] is sufficiently strong that, when combined with 
a clearly articulated policy in favor of the challenged anticompetitive conduct, there is little danger that it is involved in a private 
price fixing arrangement."" Crosby, 93 F.3d at 1525; see also Bankers, 137 F.3d at 1297 (""The more public the entity looks, the "
1314,," less we worry that it represents purely private competitive interests, and the less need there is for active state supervision to 
ensure that the entity's anticompetitive actions are indeed state actions and not those of an alliance of interests that properly 
should be competing.""). It is apparently undisputed that MAWSS is a Board of Water and Sewer Commissioners organized 
pursuant to Ala. Code §§ 11-50-340, et seq. Those statutes provide, in part, that  [*15] such a Board ""shall be deemed to be a 
public agency or instrumentality exercising public and governmental functions to provide for the public health and welfare."" Ala. 
Code § 11-50-343(a). Although there are numerous factors involved in the ""political subdivision"" inquiry, MAWSS has at least 
made a preliminary showing that it satisfies the legal criteria for that designation. There is certainly no indication in the record 
before the undersigned (and, again, MCWSFPA has not argued) that MAWSS would not properly be classified as a political 
subdivision of Alabama for state action immunity purposes."
1314,7," More generally, the Alabama legislature authorized such Boards ""[t]o exercise jurisdiction, control and supervision over any 
water system or sewer system owned, operated or maintained by the board and to make and enforce such rules and regulations 
for the maintenance and operation of any such system as may, in the judgment of the board, be necessary or desirable for the 
efficient operation of such system and for accomplishing the purposes of this article."" Ala. Code § 11-50-343(a)(9). This section 
strongly suggests that the Alabama legislature intended to confer broad discretion on Boards of Water and Sewer 
Commissioners in operating water and sewer systems, which would encompass the discretion to implement  [*18] an all-or-
nothing policy for water and sewer systems. "
1315,8," See also Reply, at 9 (""Again, Defendant offers no evidence of an Alabama authorization of its undisputed antitrust practices."") 
and 9-10 (""[I]t is MAWSS's  [*19] burden to show this Court a 'clearly articulated' Alabama Statutory scheme that exempts 
MAWSS from federal Antitrust Law. MAWSS has failed to do so."")."
1315,9," That is not to say with any finality that no valid counterarguments exist that might refute defendant's position. In fairness to 
MCWSFPA, the Court recognizes that plaintiff had just 24 hours to prepare its reply brief, so the circumstances were hardly 
conducive to expansive treatment of the issues. However, this is a dilemma of plaintiff's own creation because it is plaintiff who 
elected to present this issue to the Court for preliminary resolution in the pressure-packed, time-sensitive, unforgiving crucible of 
an Application for TRO, rather than limiting itself to a request for preliminary injunction or awaiting an opportunity for more 
reasoned reflection, research and analysis on summary judgment."
1315,10," The cavalcade of unauthorized sur-replies began with MAWSS's ""Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Issuance of Preliminary 
Injunction"" (doc. 33) filed on October 24, 2007, which proceeded for two paragraphs to discuss the Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction before stating, ""MAWSS would also like to take this opportunity to respond  [*22] to some of the argument asserted in 
MCWSFPA's reply in support of its TRO application, (Doc. 31), since it has now been given the opportunity to do so."" (Doc. 33, 
P 3.) It is unclear what this ""opportunity"" is. Certainly this Court did not afford defendant any such opportunity. Sur-replies can 
only be filed with leave of court and are ordinarily stricken if no such leave is requested or received. Neither side adhered to this 
requirement before submitting their additional memoranda. The result is particularly burdensome in this case, where the Court is 
attempting to resolve expeditiously matters that have been characterized as ""urgent"" by the movant, even as the parties have 
submitted ever-shifting briefs altering the landscape and analysis on the fly. Nonetheless, the Court in its discretion will consider 
these improperly filed memoranda. "
1316,11," See generally Boire v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., 515 F.2d 1185, 1193 (5th Cir. 1975) (affirming denial of temporary injunctive 
relief where movant, among other things, delayed three months in making its  [*26] request); Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound 
Prod., 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995) (vacating preliminary injunction where movant waited four months to seek a preliminary 
injunction after filing suit); Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985) (ten week delay in seeking injunction

of one full year before seeking preliminary relief ""knocks the bottom out of any claim of immediate and irreparable harm"")."
1316,12," The reference to Home Depot in the TRO Application is apparently a typographical error, as plaintiff's other submissions refer 
extensively to an Office Depot development, not a Home Depot. "
1317,13," To the extent that plaintiff is complaining about MAWSS's decision to build water access to those construction sites, those 
arguments appear far better suited to the claims pending in the state law action than to the antitrust issues being litigated here."
1317,14," Plaintiff having failed to satisfy two of the four mandatory prerequisites for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, no

1321,1," This does not mean that any state regulation that affects a patentee's profits so undermines the goals of the patent system as 
to be preempted. It is well established that states can generally regulate patented products as part of their general exercise of 
police powers without preemption, even if this regulation incidentally affects the profits a patentee gains from its patent. See, 
e.g., Patterson v. Kentucky, 97 U.S. 501, 24 L. Ed. 1115 (1878). But that states have broad leeway to  [**9] regulate patented "

1335,3," After defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss, they filed on April 20, 2007 a supplemental motion to dismiss arguing that 
plaintiffs' claims are barred by collateral estoppel based on a state court decision rendered in February 2007. In view of the 
court's decision today, it need not decide whether plaintiffs' claims are barred by collateral estoppel. Accordingly, defendants' 
supplemental motion to dismiss is denied without prejudice as moot."
1335,4," Defendants also contend that plaintiffs'  [**16] antitrust claims are barred under the state-action doctrine, and that antitrust 
damages are precluded under the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36(a). The court need not address 
these arguments. "
1336,5," Although courts generally refer to Noerr-Pennington ""immunity,"" the Fifth Circuit has held that Noer-Pennington immunity from 
liability is an affirmative defense because it does not provide defendants complete immunity from suit. See  [**19] Bayou Fleet

1337,6," In deciding defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court can consider the text of the Joint Statement and the Contract because 
they are properly attached to the complaint, and both documents are matters of public record. See Fin. Acquisition Partners LP 
v. Blackwell, 440 F.3d 278, 286 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Travis v. Irby, 326 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2003); Davis v. Bayless, 70 F.3d

1339,7," Although there is a ""sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity, the complaint fails to allege facts that would support this 
exception. HN9[

governmental process--as opposed to the outcome of that process--as an anticompetitive weapon."" Omni, 499 U.S. at 380. ""A

not one who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means."" Id. (citations and

Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972)). That Congress amended the Wright 
Amendment and effected its ultimate repeal within the December 31, 2006 deadline, and explicitly incorporated many of the 
terms of the Joint Statement and Contract, strongly  [**31] support the conclusion that defendants' efforts were not simply a 
sham. "
1340,8," The court is not imposing on plaintiffs the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9. On certain subjects understood to raise a high risk of abusive litigation, a plaintiff must state factual allegations with greater 
particularity than Rule 8 requires. Here, our concern is not that the allegations in the complaint were insufficiently 
particularized; rather the complaint warranted dismissal because it failed in toto to render plaintiffs' entitlement to relief 
plausible. Bell Atl., 127 S.Ct. at 1973 n.14 (quotations, brackets, and citations omitted)."
1340,9," Although the Bell Atlantic pleading standard provides a sufficient ground for dismissing plaintiffs' claims with respect to 
defendants' conduct before early 2006, the only circumstantial facts that plaintiffs assert concerning this period suggest that, 
even if there was a pre-2006 conspiracy, the conduct was protected under Noerr-Pennington. Plaintiffs allege that ""[i]n the 
summer of 2005, three bills were introduced in the United States Congress seeking outright repeal or further  [**36] modification

efforts. "
1341,10," That the statement may have been unwarranted and may have caused incidental anticompetitive effects does not support a 
sham exception to defendants' Noerr-Pennington defense. As noted supra at note 7, a sham situation involves a defendant 
whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable governmental action rather than at one who genuinely seeks to 
achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means. Even assuming that Mayor Miller's comments were 
wrongful and without authority, the complaint demonstrates on its face that the comments were part of defendants' petitioning 
efforts and therefore protected under Noerr-Pennington."
1341,11," At least at the pleading stage, plaintiffs have established antitrust standing based on their intent and preparedness to enter the 
airline market. See Compl. P 17. ""There are numerous decisions stating that HN12[
] one need not have an actual going 
business to obtain standing, but an attempt to enter a business is sufficient."" Martin v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 365 F.2d 629, 633 
(5th Cir. 1966). ""However,  [**42] these decisions lay down two significant requirements. First, there must be the intention to 
enter the business; and second, there must be a showing of preparedness to enter the business."" Id. Plaintiffs have adequately 
alleged that they intend to enter the airline market and that they are prepared to do so."
1341,12," HN13[
] ""Restraint in the market affects consumers and competitors in the market; as such they are the parties that have 
standing to sue."" Bell v. Dow Chem. Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1183 (5th Cir. 1988). Defendants do not deny that plaintiffs are 
competitors in the airline gate market. Rather, they maintain that plaintiffs cannot challenge Dallas' use of eminent domain 
proceedings. "
1342,13," Plaintiffs allege that they are consumers of airline tickets for flights out of Love Field and DFW, Compl. P 17, and that 
defendants' conspiracy has artificially inflated ticket prices, id. at PP 57 and 68. "

] Although ""[l]egislative history can be a legitimate guide to a statutory purpose obscured by ambiguity . . . [i]n the 
absence of a  [**48] clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, the language of the statute itself must ordinarily be 
regarded as conclusive."" Burlington, 481 U.S. at 461 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the court concludes that 
the Reform Act's meaning is clear on its face, it need not address the parties' arguments concerning the Reform Act's legislative 
history. "
1344,15, The parties agree that the Lemmon Avenue facility is the LTP Terminal. 
1345,16," Plaintiffs contend that construing the Reform Act to incorporate the Contract raises constitutional problems under New York v. 
United States, 505 U.S. 144, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1992), and Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 117 S. Ct. 
2365, 138 L. Ed. 2d 914 (1997). They maintain that the Reform Act would unconstitutionally commandeer Dallas to exercise its 
eminent domain powers, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. The court disagrees. The Reform Act does not compel Dallas to 
enact and enforce a federal regulatory program. See Printz, 521 U.S. at 925-933; New York, 505 U.S. at 160-166. As 
distinguished from Printz and New York, the local governments in the present case whose conduct is regulated by the Reform 
Act voluntarily sought Congress' statutory endorsement of their local agreement. Therefore, construing the Reform Act to 
incorporate the Contract does not raise constitutional problems. "

Reply Decl."") P 15, or ""to force the Rangers' unique, individual website into the NHL's league-oriented homogeneous template,"" 
see Richman Decl. P 9, are all without support in the record. It is also undisputed that, under the New Media Strategy, the 
Rangers will retain the responsibility and opportunity for populating its website with local stories and information about local 
players and games, see Ritter Decl. P 27, and that a  [*14] visitor who clicks on newyorkrangers.com will go directly to the 
Rangers' home page, that is, its page containing local content, not to the NHL home page. See Tr. of Oral Argument at 55 (Oct. 
23, 2007). Thus, the Rangers' ""analysis"" of the harms the team will sustain as a result of the actions complained of are wholly 
irrelevant; they are based entirely on the assumption that the NHL will ""take over"" the Rangers' website and that the Rangers will 
lose control of the content therein. Those are not the facts of this case. Accordingly, the Rangers' declarations are largely 
irrelevant to the facts presented."
1377,6," See, e.g., Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 506-07 (2d Cir. 2004). "
1379,7," See, e.g., 1 ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 470 (6th ed. 2007) (""Agreements among the parents 
not to compete with the joint venture  [*22] in the market in which the joint venture operates generally have been upheld as 
reasonable ancillary restraints.""). To the extent that this general rule would not apply if the parents have market power in that 
market, MSG has failed to offer any evidence of what constitutes the relevant market. See id.; Plaintiff's Reply Memorandum of 
Law in Support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction (""Pl's Repl. Mem."") at 10 (acknowledging that while MSG's Complaint 
identified ""several relevant markets,"" it would prove the dynamics and scope of these markets ""at the appropriate point.""). Given 
that the Court has found that the restraints imposed by the NHL are not ""naked restraints"" without any redeeming virtue, the 
appropriate point is now, and MSG has failed to meet the burden."
1379,8," Indeed, MSG's declarations seem not to focus on harm to competition but rather to the harm MSG perceives to a competitor, 
viz., itself, in its ability to cross-market its various businesses. See, e.g., Richman Decl. P 9; Richman Reply Declaration P 4. 
However, ""[t]he antitrust laws were enacted for 'the protection of competition, not competitors.'"" Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA

U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962)). Also, as set out supra n.5, because MSG's declarations fail to address

1388,1," The allegations described here comes from Hynix's counterclaims. Micron and Nanya make similar monopolization and

1391,4," The Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part this decision. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 
100, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969). The Court did not, however, review the propriety of awarding treble damages for 
patent litigation expenses. See id. at 133 (""HRI has not challenged that award in this Court."") "
1396,5," Rambus also argues that Hynix and Nanya did not request nominal damages in their prayer for relief. Both Hynix and Nanya 
request ""such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate."" This general prayer suffices here to provide for 
nominal damages, if proven at trial. See Basista v. Weir, 340 F.2d 74, 87-88 (3d Cir. 1965) (""[I]t is not necessary to allege 
nominal damages and nominal damages are proved by proof of depriviation [sic] of a right to which the plaintiff was entitled"");

1397,6," The court notes that many of the facts underlying the fraud claim will be decided by the jury in deciding the antitrust claims. 
Even if the Manufacturers are not entitled to a jury, the court will be required to decide the merits of the fraud claim in accord 
with the jury's factual findings. See Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S. Ct. 948, 3 L. Ed. 2d 988 (1959);

Jul. 16, 2007) (unpublished) (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1969). "
1406,2," This particular RESPA issue is an instance in which the standing analysis collapses into a 12(b)(6) analysis. Pulte's cases all 
focus on the statute requiring an overcharge as the injury in fact. E.g., Moore v. Radian Group, Inc., 233 F. Supp. 2d 819, 825 
(E.D. Tex. 2002). If a plaintiff must be overcharged to suffer an injury in fact, then no one could ever state a claim under RESPA 
without alleging an overcharge. On the other hand, Capell's cases hold that the plaintiff suffers a non-financial injury when 
defendant violates RESPA. E.g., Robinson v. Fountainhead Title Group Corp., 447 F. Supp. 2d 478, 489 (D. Md. 2006) (""lack of 
impartiality in the referral and a reduction of competition between settlement service providers""). If a plaintiff can show injury in 
fact by pointing to non-financial injury, then no one would have to allege an overcharge to establish a claim. We believe adding a 
constitutional dimension to the  [*12] inquiry only muddles the analysis, so we avoid discussing the issue at hand in such terms. "
1407,3," Pulte's view also seems to misunderstand the exact harm that Congress is trying to protect against. Through RESPA § 8(a), 
Congress prohibited creating arrangements to refer business except, of course, for the exemptions. Much like conspiracy, it is 
the agreement itself that is the wrong, and the defendant need do no more than engage in such a nonexempt agreement to have 
wronged the plaintiff. "
1409,4," The one example Capell does provide from HUD's implementing regulation concerns instances when it is appropriate to 
compensate individuals for referring business, and is inapposite here. Id. at 18. Capell points to no other portion of the 
regulations or any examples of its application to support her contention. "
1439,*," The ""Section 5"" test is: (1) the consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing 
benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably had avoided. 
15 U.S.C. 45(n). "
1446,1," Plaintiffs' alleged this theory as follows (Compl. P 22): As to ""minimum"" monthly payments, the ""disclosures"" in the Capital One Customer Agreement note that ""APR [(Annual 
Percentage Rate)] increases and fees, including late, overlimit and returned payment fees, may increase your minimum 
payment."" Id. Capital One represents  [*13] that paying the ""minimum payment amount"" will keep the account in good 
standing. However, Capital One does not disclose that the ""minimum payment"" amount set forth on the customer's monthly 
billing statement does not include amounts allegedly due for late, over-the-limit, returned payment fees or other fees 
incurred in that month, notwithstanding that Capital One charges interest on the fees. Most customers in the sub-prime 
market targeted by Capital One make the ""minimum payment"" reflected on their bills. But where penalty fees have been 
assessed for a given month, customers who pay only the minimum payment amount represented as the customers' 
""minimum payment amount"" did not include amounts incurred that month for penalty fees, including late, over-the-limit and 
returned payment fees. As a result, customers find themselves continually in ""default"" and cannot ""catch up"" because the 
monthly statements fail to include these fees as part of the ""minimum payment"" for that particular month. "
1448,2," Defendants also present evidence that each plaintiff testified in his or her deposition that they did not rely on the stated 
minimum payment in deciding the amount they would pay each month. Myrna Bragado testified that she paid more than the 
minimum stated payment when she had sufficient funds (McGuire Decl. Exh. B, 119:18-120:2). The testimony of the other 
plaintiffs concurred; they paid as much as they could  [*24] afford regardless of the amount stated on the minimum payment (id. 
at Exh. C, 182:25-183:15; Exh. D, 177:2-11; Exh. E, 177:2-11). This testimony does not go quite so far as defendants contend. 
Plaintiffs may have made an extra effort to pay at least the minimum payment, so it is still possible that they could have relied on 
that amount in some fashion. As defendants have shown above, however, defendants have eliminated triable issues of fact as to 
whether that reliance by itself caused plaintiffs to incur more fees. "
1452,3, It is worth adding that no claim is made that the practice is undisclosed. 
1458,1, Stop & Shop and Giant are related companies. (Am. Compl. PP 18-19.)
1458,2," Under the terms of the Delco-Giant lease, Giant was granted the exclusive right to operate a supermarket, supermarket-
drugstore, or drugstore in the Grande Center during the period of the lease. (Am. Compl. Ex. A § 9.3(a)(1).) In addition, the lease 
provides that ""[o]nce the Premises have been open for business for 1 day as a supermarket, Tenant shall not be required to 
operate continuously in all or any part  [*5] of the Premises."" (Id. at § 9.2(b)(1).) The lease further provides Delco with two forms 
of recourse if Giant fails to operate a supermarket in the premises. First, if Giant seeks to sublease the premises for a non-
supermarket use, then Delco has a 30-day period within which to pay a lease termination fee and terminate the lease. (Id. at § 
11.6(c).) Second, the lease provides that if after Giant opens for business ""there is no business being operated in at least 25,000 
square feet of the Premises for more than 270 consecutive days,"" then Delco can also pay the lease termination fee and 
terminate the lease. (Id. at § 9.2(b)(2).) The lease termination fee to be paid by Delco recognizes that Giant had contributed the 
construction funds to build the supermarket building, to avoid a windfall to Delco in the event of early termination of the lease. "
1459,3," Dr. Cotterill is the Director of the Food Marketing Policy Center and a Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of 
Connecticut. (Cotterill Report Attach. A.) Dr. Cotterill has a joint Ph.D. in economics and agricultural economics from the 
University of Wisconsin - Madison and has served as an economic expert in numerous supermarket antitrust and merger cases, 
working with the Attorneys General of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island and the Federal Trade Commission. 
(Cotterill Report 1-2.) He has 30 years of experience analyzing antitrust issues in food markets, including the New Jersey 
supermarket industry. (Id. at 1-3.) "
1460,4," These supermarkets are: the ShopRite in Rio Grande, the Acme and Super Fresh on Wildwood Island to the east of the 
Grande Center, and two Acmes in Cape May to the south of the Grande Center. (Cotterill Report 14.)"
1460,5," The  [*15] Cotterill Report presents the equation as follows: $ 9.25 (detour cost) divided by .05 (SSNIP) equals $ 185.00. (Id. at 
15.)"
1460,6," Dr. Cotterill does not label this section of his analysis ""critical loss analysis,"" and, as Dr. Ordover notes, Dr. Cotterill uses a 
different formula than is typically performed in critical loss analysis. (Ordover Report P 47.) Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity, 
the Court uses the term to label this section of Dr. Cotterill's analysis."
1460,7," In his initial report, Dr. Cotterill calculated this figure at 33.65%. In his errata he submitted revised calculations with the figure 
set between 21% and 23%. (Cotterill Errata, Ex. P-2.) "
1461,8," Dr. Ordover is a Professor of Economics and former Director of the Masters in Economics Program at New York University. 
(Ordover Report P 1.) He is also a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics at the Antitrust Division of the 
United States Department of Justice, where he was a co-drafter of the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines. (Id.)  [*20] Dr. 
Ordover has served as an antitrust consultant and expert in numerous governmental and adjudicative contexts, including 
consulting on supermarket mergers in the United States and New Zealand. (Id. at P 2.) "
1462,9," Dr. Ordover describes the accepted critical loss formula as follows: ""for a price increase of X percent and a variable margin of 
M percent, the critical loss is X/(X + M)."" (Id. at P 47.)"
1462,10," Dr. Ordover's figure of 25% is lower than the figure reported in Dr. Cotterill's original report. As noted above, in the errata to Dr. 
Cotterill's report, Dr. Cotterill determined that the figure should be between 21% and 23%. (Cotterill Errata 1.) "
1463,11," Further, Dr. Cotterill has seemingly ignored the historic data that shows that Stop & Shop's entry into the market has not been 
shown to depress the ShopRite's sales or profits. ShopRite's annual sales per square foot grew approximately 18.3% between 
March 2004 and August 2006 (see Exs. 3, parts 1 & 2 to Ordover Report). Shop Rite's net income at the Rio Grande store also 
grew substantially during the period  [*25] of Stop & Shop's operation for 2006 and 2007 (see Att. B-3 to Cotterill Report). 
Meanwhile, Stop & Shop unfortunately operated at a substantial, constant loss throughout its 20 months at the Grande Center, 
despite its brand name recognition, as Dr. Ordover testified, and as shown by the confidential data in Att. C-1 to the Cotterill 
Report. These financial results also support the decision of the Stop & Shop management to unload this supermarket as part of 
the nine-store deal with Wakefern for lawful business reasons. "
1464,12," Because Delco seeks both monetary and injunctive relief in this action, the Court addresses all five parts of the Lower Lake 
Erie Iron Ore test. However, the Court notes that the elements that the two tests have in common - antitrust injury, causation, 
and directness - are sufficient to show that Delco lacks standing under the less restrictive section 16 standard as well as under 
section 4. "
1465,13," The recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft, in which the court found that 
Novell had antitrust standing despite the fact that it did not compete in the same market as Microsoft, is distinguishable from the 
present case. Nos. 06-1134, 06-1238, 505 F.3d 302, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24101, 2007 WL 2984372, at *1 (4th Cir. Oct. 15, 
2007) . In Novell, the court took as true Novell’s allegations that although the plaintiff was not a competitor in the “PC operating-
systems market,” Microsoft “specifically targeted [Novell’s] products for destruction.” Id. at *10. such targeting was at least 
conceivable in Novell because while Novell did not compete with Microsoft in the PC operating-systems market, it did compete 
with Microsoft in the “office-productivity applications” market. Id. at *1. while acknowledging that “the defendant’s specific intent 
to injure the plaintiff is not a panacea,” the court placed great emphasis on the issue of “whether the harm was intended.” Id. at 
*10 (internal quotations and citations omitted) In the instant case, Delco has not alleged that Defendants’ activities were driven 
by a specific intent to injure Delco. Rather, Delco complains that “[t]he clear purpose and effect of wakefern’s conduct . . . has 
been . . . the preclusion and suppression of legitimate competition between Wakefern’s supermarkets and other supermarkets in 
lower Cape May County, including the (former) Stop & Shop supermarket in the Grande Center.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.) While a 
non-consumer, non- competitor victim of such deliberate targeting as was alleged in Novell might “have suffered an injury of the 
type - almost exclusively suffered by consumers or competitors - that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,” Steamfitters, 
171 F.3d at 926 n.8, this is not such a case. "
1466,14," The same is true of the injury Delco claims to have suffered as a result of the “loss of . . . rental income from neighboring 
tenants.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 66.) If Delco’s contracts with neighboring tenants provide for reduced payments in the absence of a 
supermarket at the Grande Center, as Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint suggests, and the Delco-Giant lease permits the lessee to 
cease operating a supermarket after being open for business for one day, then these contractual provisions would appear to be 
the primary cause of Delco’s injuries. (Am. Compl. Ex. A § 9.2(b)(1).)"
1466,15," The fact that Delco alleges that Defendants’ conduct amounts to a se violation of the antitrust laws, of course, has no bearing 
on whether Delco has standing to bring this suit in the first place. See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 
344, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (“proof of a per se violation and of antitrust injury are distinct matters that must

1483,4," . The Board of Trustees shall not deny approval of any site plan unless such denial is made by a duly adopted 
resolution of the Board of Trustees that includes findings of fact detailing the specific standards (listed in Subsection 
10-1-9.E [below] of this Chapter) with which the site plan fails to conform. E. Standards for Site Plan Review. The Architectural Board of Review shall not recommend disapproval, and the Board of 
Trustees shall not disapprove, a site plan submitted pursuant to this Section except on the basis of specific written findings 
directed to one or more of the following standards:"
1483,1," . The application is materially incomplete in specified particulars or contains or reveals violations of this Title or other 
 [**8] applicable regulations that the applicant has, after written request, failed or refused to supply or correct."
1483,2," . The proposed development depicted on the site plan fails to meet specified standards required by the provisions of 
this Title for the zoning district in which the subject property is located."
1483,3, . The proposed site plan is unreasonably injurious or detrimental to the use and enjoyment of surrounding property.
1483,4," . The proposed site plan creates undue traffic congestion or hazards in the public streets, or the circulation elements 
of the proposed site plan unreasonably create hazards to safety on or off site or disjointed or inefficient pedestrian or 
vehicular circulation paths on or off site."
1483,5, . The screening or landscaping proposed does not provide adequate shielding from or for nearby uses.

1483,7, . The proposed site plan places unwarranted or unreasonable burdens on specified utility systems serving the site.
1483,8," . With regard to property in the CBD, the proposed site plan is inconsistent with the standards set forth in Section 10-
4A-9 of this Title. Lake Bluff Village Ordinance, 10-1-9(D) and (E)."
1483,3," While Mercatus refers to the Village approval as one for a ""special"" use, the Village Defendants refer to it as approval for 
""developmental"" use. According to Mercatus, the extra approval required by the Board was for an (unnecessary) special use 
permit, while the Village Defendants assert that the approval required by the Board was simply the ""developmental"" approval 
required under the language of the Amendments. The court will use the terms interchangeably. "
1486,4," Mercatus initially contends that because the complaint alleges that the hearings before the Village Board were adjudicative or 
administrative in nature, those allegations are sufficient to survive a Noerr-Pennington challenge. United States Futures Exch., 
LLC v. Bd. of Trade of Chi., 04 C 6756, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17779, 2005 WL 2035652, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 22, 2005)(denying 
defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that misrepresentations to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may not be 
protected by Noerr-Pennington immunity and stating that ""since it is possible, when viewing the allegations in the light most 
favorable to the Plaintiffs, that the proceedings [before the CFTC] could be considered as adjudicatory, it would not be proper for 
[the court] to dismiss Plaintiffs allegations at this time.""). The court does not agree with Mercatus's assertion that merely by 
alleging that the proceedings were adjudicatory, it can necessarily survive a motion to dismiss. As an initial matter, Twombly now 
requires enough facts to support plausibility, not just possibility. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1969  [**20] (retiring language in Conley 
v. Gibson, ""that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff 
can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief""). Moreover, even under the pre-Twombly 
standard, the Seventh Circuit's determination of the actions by the Rockford City Council in Metro Cable occurred at the motion 
to dismiss stage. "
1488,5," It is not clear whether the two-prong test identified in Professional  [**27] Real Estate Investors, Inc., applies outside of the 
litigation context; however, the parties frame the issue as such, and therefore the court addresses the parties' arguments as they 
make them."
1488,6," The court does not opine on whether Mercatus filed a timely Open Meetings Act challenge in the appropriate court. See 5 ILCS 
120/3 (""Where the provisions of this Act are not complied with, or where there is probable cause to believe that the provisions of 
this Act will not be complied with, any person, including the State's Attorney of the county in which such noncompliance may 
occur, may bring a civil action in the circuit court for the judicial circuit in which the alleged noncompliance has occurred or is 
about to occur, or in which the affected public body has its principal office, prior to or within 60 days of the meeting alleged to be 
in violation of this Act or, if facts concerning  [**29] the meeting are not discovered within the 60- day period, within 60 days of 
the discovery of a violation by the State's Attorney.""). "
1489,7," Mercatus filed a motion for leave to file a surreply to address what it argued was a new (and, therefore, improper) argument in 
LFH's reply in support of its motion to dismiss-that is, Mercatus's standing to raise an antitrust challenge to LFH's non-petitioning 
conduct. The court agrees with LFH that it properly addressed the non-petitioning conduct issue in its reply which Mercatus 
raised in its response. In any event, the court grants Mercatus's motion for leave to file a surreply and has also considered LFH's 
response  [**31] to that motion."
1489,8," Specifically, these allegations include that:"
1489,1," . LFH engaged in alleged anticompetitive conduct by ""pressuring"" physician practice groups who had signed agreements 
to practice at the Mercatus Center ""to alter the terms of their agreements"" (Cmplt. at P 45) See Arnett, 382 F. Supp. 2d at 
1096 (hiring of defendant doctors by plaintiff did not amount to anticompetitive activity or confer antitrust standing);"
1489,2, . LFH made threatening phone calls to dissuade physicians who were considering practicing at Mercatus (Id. at 46);
1489,3," . LFH offered to purchase the Shepard Land itself and attempted to dissuade Shepard from proceeding with the Mercatus 
contract (Id. at 47);"
1489,4," . A LFH employee called another hospital to boast of its  [**34] actions in Lake Bluff, warn that hospital about Mercatus, 
and advise the hospital not to work with Mercatus. (Id. at 48). "
1491,9," To the extent that Mercatus alleges or argues that the Village Board is not entitled to state action immunity because it acted 
outside of its authority when it required additional approval based on the ""further approval"" language in the Amendments, it is 
incorrect. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. at 371-72 (rejecting argument that city was not protected by Parker immunity 
when the city purportedly acted outside of its authority in enacting billboard law because HN20[
] ""in order to prevent Parker 
from undermining the very interests of federalism it is designed to protect, it is necessary to adopt a concept of authority broader 
than what is applied to determine the legality of the municipality's action under state law."")."
1491,10," The court does not necessarily agree that the ""effective decisionmaker"" approach to private party state action immunity is the 
proper analysis. Indeed, neither party cites to any cases from the Seventh Circuit in their discussion of state action immunity. 
Nevertheless, the court addresses the issue as framed by the parties. In any event, to the extent any inconsistency exists 
between the approach offered by the parties and the two-part test articulated by the Supreme Court, it need not be resolved as 
the court would reach the same conclusion under either approach. "
1493,11," If the court were to find that the Village Trustees were acting in their legislative capacity, Mercatus would  [**48] not be entitled 
to notice or an opportunity to be heard. Pro-Eco, Inc. v. Board of Commr's, 57 F.3d 505 (7th Cir. 1995)(""Governing bodies may 
enact generally applicable laws, that is, they may legislate, without affording affected parties so much as notice and an 
opportunity to be heard.""). "
1494,12," To the extent that Mercatus alleges that it was denied equal protection of the laws based on the Village Defendants' violation 
of state or local law, such a conclusion would contradict the Seventh Circuit's statement that violations of state law are not 
constitutional violations. Pro-Eco, 57 F.3d at 515  [**54] (rejecting the plaintiff's argument that a moratorium on landfills was not 
rationally based because in enacting the ordinance the board deviated from state law and therefore could not have had a 
reasonable expectation that it would be enforced because ""if [it] bought this misdirected argument, we would negate our earlier 
proposition that violations of state procedural statutes do not amount to constitutional violations""). "
1503,1," The defendants are Bank of America, N.A.; Bank of America Corporation; N.B. Holdings; MBNA America Bank, N.A.; Capital 
One Bank; Capital One F.S.B.; Capital One Financial Corporation; Chase Bank USA, N.A.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Bank One 
Corporation; Bank One; Citibank South Dakota, N.A.; Citigroup, Inc.; Washington Mutual Bank; Providian; Washington Mutual, 
Inc.; Wells Fargo & Company; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; Wells Fargo Financial Bank; and Wells Fargo Financial National Bank."
1503,2," The plaintiffs are Andrew T. Pinon, Betty Simm, Cathy Simm, Sara Prentiss-Shaw, Audree Halasz, David V. Brotman, Gwen 
Martin, Celeste Brackley, Marilyn Foster-Nemec, Aaron Gonzalez, and Elizabeth Young."
1503,3," Each plaintiff claims to have paid at least one late or over-limit fee in the four years preceding the filing of the complaint. See 
Docket No. 63 (Compl. PP 12-22.) No plaintiff identifies which of the defendants (if any) issued a credit card  [**7] to him or her, 
no plaintiff specifies which type of fee (i.e., late fee or over-limit fee) he or she has paid, and no plaintiff pleads to which of the 
defendants (if any) he or she paid that unspecified fee. The plaintiffs do not allege that the defendant holding companies issued 
their credit cards, imposed late or over-limit fees on them, or otherwise took any action in connection with the conduct that the 
complaint raises. "
1504,4," The plaintiffs assert claims under the NBA with respect to all defendants except Washington Mutual Bank, which they allege is 
subject to the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1831d. The defendants maintain that 
Washington Mutual Bank is in fact subject to 12 U.S.C. § 1463. Because the parties do not dispute that the various provisions 
are virtually identical, the Court will refer solely to the NBA. HN4[
] The NBA authorizes a national bank to charge whatever rates are allowed by the laws of the state where the bank is 
located. Here, in the states where the defendant banks are located, the state laws allow any rates agreed  [**12] to in the 
contracts between the banks and their customers. See DEL. CODE, tit. 5, §§ 943-945, 950; NEV. REV. STAT. § 99.050; S.D. 
CODIFIED LAWS § 54-3-1.1; VA. CODE ANN. § 6.1-330.63(A). "
1505,5," HN7[
] Based upon the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, ""where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would 
raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is 
plainly contrary to the intent of Congress."" Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 
U.S. 568, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1392, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1988) (citing NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 499-501, 
504, 99 S. Ct. 1313, 59 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1979)). "
1506,6," HN13[
] Title 12 C.F.R. § 7.4001(a) defines ""interest"" as used in 12 U.S.C. § 85 as including: ""any payment compensating a creditor  [**20] or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a 
borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit "
1507,," extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, creditor-imposed not sufficient funds (NSF) fees charged when a 
borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds, over-limit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, 
and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance 
guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred 
to obtain credit reports."""
1507,7," The chart lists seven card issuers, but two are controlled by defendant Bank of America. "
1508,8," The complaint also explains why late fees were lower before 1995: state regulatory provisions constrained late fees until 1995, 
when the Comptroller of the Currency issued a regulation interpreting the NBA to preempt those laws. See Docket No. 63 
(Compl. PP 3, 62-63). "
1511,9," The plaintiffs have argued that credit card accounts are ""goods or services"" as that phrase is used in other statutes, but those 
different statutes are inapposite, especially in light of the particular legislative history of the CLRA making it clear that the 
legislature intentionally excluded credit. See, e.g., Van Slyke, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 1358-59; Augustine, 485 F. Supp. 2d at 1175. "
1517,1," GO Computer, Inc., is obviously meant to be GO Corporation's successor-in-interest, and for convenience we will continue 
referring to both simply as ""GO."" "
1519,2," It is unusual, of course, to hear the appellant challenging our jurisdiction over an appeal. But HN5[
] ""questions concerning 
subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time by either party or sua sponte by this court,"" Plyler v. Moore, 129 F.3d 728, 
731 n.6 (4th Cir. 1997); we will therefore resolve GO's jurisdictional claim. "
1520,3," While our good colleague makes a substantial argument in his separate opinion on the question of waiver, we think appellants' 
purported waiver of the right to appeal is surrounded by uncertainties and contingencies not sufficiently fleshed out in the record 
and briefs. We thus think the most prudent course is to meet appellants' argument on the merits, as did the district court. "
1536,1," In addition to the sale of MACtac to UPM, UPM agreed to sell Walki Films, its European flexible packaging entity, to Bemis. 
(Second Am. Compl. P 61.) The sale of Walki Films was completed in October, 2002. (Id. P 63.)"
1536,2," In the DOJ Merger Litigation, UPM and Bemis defended its transaction by arguing that MACtac was a ""weakened competitor,"" 
and that the acquisition was essential to MACtac's survival in the PSL industry. See UPM-Kymmene Oyj, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
12820, 2003 WL 21781902, at *10. The district court rejected this argument, concluding MACtac was non-competitive because 
Bemis elected not to compete. 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12820, [WL] at *11. After the acquisition was enjoined, MACtac instructed 
its sales representatives to reassure customers that MACtac was a profitable company, and that its weakened-competitor 
argument was a litigation strategy, not a reflection of its actual state. (See Ex. 22 to Bruckner Decl., Dkt. Entry 247-23.) "
1537,3," Plaintiffs notified the Court of ""supplemental authority"" on May 3, 2007, (Dkt. Entry 293); July 20, 2007, (Dkt. Entry 298); August 
6, 2007, (Dkt. Entry 299); and October 12, 2007. (Dkt. Entry 313.) Merits discovery has been stayed pending class certification. On August 27, 2007, Plaintiffs moved to amend Pre-Trial Order No. 
1 so as to allow some merits discovery while the class certification motion remained pending. (Dkt. Entry 300.) That motion will 
 [*22] now be dismissed as moot. On September 18, 2007, Bemis and MACtac moved for dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the basis of Bell 
Atlantic Corp. v Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), decided in May of 2007. In October of 2007, Bemis and 
MACtac moved to stay any ruling on the class certification motion until after resolution of their motion to dismiss. On November 
7, 2007, this Court denied their request to stay disposition of the class certification motion pending a ruling on the motion to 
dismiss. (Dkt. Entry 332.) Oral argument on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for December 11, 2007. "
1540,4," Dr. Beyer described piggyback labels as having ""a unique five-layer construction,"" including ""a face material, an adhesive, a 
base material, another adhesive layer, and an additional base material."" (Beyer Aff. P 18 n.15.) Foil labelstock has a metallic 
face material. (Id. P 18.) Together, foil and piggyback PSL account for 1% of the PSL market. (Id.) "
1542,5," Rule 23(b)(3) continues: HN15[
] The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling 
the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the  [*40] extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy 
already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation 
of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action. "
1543,6," The Supreme Court has held that HN20[
] horizontal agreements -- which are agreements among competitors -- to fix prices and to divide markets or allocate customers are per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Palmer v. BRG of 
Ga., Inc., 498 U.S. 46, 49, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1990) (per curiam); United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 
596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972); United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397-98, 47 S. Ct. 377, 
71 L. Ed. 700 (1927)."
1543,7," At oral argument, Defendants argued that the paper supply agreement between Avery and UPM is not a horizontal agreement. 
Rather, they maintain the agreement was a vertical, dual distribution agreement, and that liability can be established only by 
considering a ""host of individualized issues"" under the rule of reason. (Oral Argument Tr. 65, 67.) See Elecs. Commc'ns. Corp. v. 
Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., Inc., 129 F.3d 240, 243 (2d Cir. 1997) (dual distribution agreements are vertical restraints 
analyzed under the rule of reason); see also id. at 244 (under rule of reason analysis, an agreement violates federal antitrust 
law if it has ""an actual adverse effect on competition in the relevant market""). This argument is meritless. HN21[
] A dual 
distribution  [*44] arrangement is one ""[w]here a manufacturer or trademark licensor uses independent distributors and itself 
operates as a distributor in actual or potential competition with its independent distributors."" ABA Section of Antitrust Law, 
Antitrust Law Developments 160 (5th ed. 2002). Here, UPM did not supply label papers to Avery for subsequent distribution. 
Instead, Plaintiffs allege, Avery purchased paperstock from UPM in consideration for UPM/Raflatac's promise to refrain from 
competing in the United States PSL market. As such, the agreement was between competitors and, therefore, horizontal. "
1545,8," It is worth noting that courts applying the Bogosian short-cut ordinarily do not rest their 8 decision to certify a class strictly on 
this presumption. Instead, they routinely assess the plaintiffs' economic analysis of the industry at issue, either as an alternative 
to the presumption or as a justification for its application. See, e.g., In re Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 153-55; In re Polyester Staple, 
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52525, 2007 WL 2111380, at *20-23;  [*50] In re Microcrystalline Cellulose, 218 F.R.D. at 89-92; In re 
Mercedes-Benz, 213 F.R.D. at 189-91. "
1549,9," In an earlier Memorandum and Order, the Court held that Plaintiffs alleged a self- 9 concealing conspiracy. In re Pressure 
Sensitive Labelstock, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9827, 2006 WL 433891, at *4."
1549,10," HN30[
] The fraudulent concealment doctrine applies if the plaintiff establishes three elements: 10 (1) fraudulent 
concealment; (2) plaintiff's failure to discover his claim; and (3) plaintiff's failure to discover occurred despite his due diligence. In 
re Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 160. Element one is considered a common question, while elements two and three usually present 
individual questions. Id. (quoting In re Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. at 487). "
1550,11," The Court previously appointed these firms interim co-lead counsel. (See Order of 11 Court, Dec. 17, 2003, Dkt. Entry 31.) "
1556,1," Plaintiffs' tying claims are asserted under both federal and state law. The Idaho Supreme Court regards federal antitrust case 
law as persuasive in deciding state antitrust claims. See, e.g., K. Hefner, Inc. v. Caremark, Inc., 128 Idaho 726, 918 P.2d 595 
(1996). Federal case law generally determines the outcome of state antitrust claims where the state adheres to federal antitrust 
law. See McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1988).  [*10] Accordingly, the Court will address the 
tying claims under federal law, and the state tying claims will remain or fall with the federal claims. "
1559,2," Although Defendant Park Pointe Realty, Inc. did not present the zero foreclosure defense in its brief, counsel for Park Pointe 
indicated during oral argument that Park Pointe joined in all defenses asserted by the other Defendants. Therefore, because 
Plaintiffs' theory of the case is nearly identical in all four cases, the Court finds that the zero foreclosure defense supports 
summary judgment in favor of Park Pointe as well as the other Defendants. "

1585,3," Although Napster users connected to one another to exchange digital files, centralized servers run by Napster maintained 
directories of all the files that users were sharing online. (FAC P 42.) Unfortunately for Napster, the vast majority of files 
exchanged through its file-sharing network were copyrighted, see Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 
913, 924, 125 S. Ct. 2764, 162 L. Ed. 2d 781 (2005) (describing Napster as a ""notorious file-sharing service""), and the company

239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001)."
1585,4," In its Corrected First Amended Answer (Doc. # 42), Lime Wire expressly denies the allegations of copyright infringement set 
forth in the record companies' Complaint. (D. Corrected First Amended Ans. PP 65-108.) According to the FAC, ""[u]sers who 
install Lime Wire on their computers do so by their own volition and are only able to install the Lime Wire application if they first 
agree not to use the application to infringe the copyrights of others."" (FAC P 43.) As a result, individuals using Lime Wire's file-
sharing application do so without its assistance and ""in the manner that they alone choose."" (Id.) "
1586,5," MusicNet was a joint venture among EMI (whose subsidiaries are parties to this litigation), BMG and Warner Music, and also 
allegedly served as the sole source for Sony and UMG music content as well. (FAC PP 34, 36.) Pressplay was a joint venture 
between UMG and Sony Music. (Id. 34.)"
1586,6," It is unclear whether MusicNet's ""wholesale price"" was for a blanket license to all works in the Major Labels' catalogs, see 
Broadcast Music, inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 24, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (subjecting ""blanket license"" pricing scheme 
to rule of reason analysis), or for a more  [**9] limited license to a subset of those works."
1586,7," Filtering mechanisms prevent P2P users from downloading copyrighted songs from other networked users without 
authorization. "
1587,8," Hashes are metadata that act as unique identifiers for digital files. (FAC P 45.) Lime Wire designed its filtering system to block 
copyrighted files based on the hashes unique to each work. (Id.) See infra at 8."
1587,9," Notably, the FAC does not allege that Lime Wire solicited licensed, copyrighted content from any of the counter-defendants."
1587,10, See supra note 8.
1587,11," See FAC 45 (""Lime Wire planned to utilize a robust filtering mechanism to inhibit users from downloading copyrighted works 
and to allow competitive access to the Counter-Defendants' copyrighted works to make available for download and purchase by 
users of the LimeWire application.""). "
1589,12," HN3[
] The Sherman Act contains the substantive prohibitions against anticompetitive conduct, while private parties are granted the right to sue for violations of the antitrust laws by § 4 (damages) and § 16 (injunctive relief) of the Clayton Act. See 
Paycom, 467 F.3d at 290."
1589,13," Preliminarily, counter-defendants argue that Lime Wire lacks standing to sue under the antitrust laws because it is not yet a 
functioning business participating in the digital distribution market.  [**19] (Counter-D. Mem. 12-13.) Lime Wire, in turn, asserts 
that it is precisely counter-defendants' anticompetitive conduct that foreclosed it from entering the market. (Counter-P. Mem. 13.) 
HN5[
] ""Under § 4 of the Clayton Act, it is as unlawful to prevent a person from engaging in a business as it is to drive a person out of business."" Waldron v. British Petroleum Co., 231 F. Supp. 72, 81 (S.D.N.Y. 1964). Where a party ""alleges that [it] has 
been prevented from engaging in a business, [it] must show that [it] had the intention and preparedness to engage in that 
business."" Id.; see Indium Corp. of Am. v. Semi-Alloys, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 379, 385 (N.D.N.Y. 1985) (observing that, in 
determining whether plaintiff has demonstrated the ""requisite intention and preparedness,"" courts consider, inter alia, 
""[a]ffirmative action on the part of plaintiff to engage in the proposed business""). Lime Wire alleges that it created a P2P file-
sharing application, developed the MagnetMix website, secured licenses and hashes from independent artists and labels, 
entered into advertising arrangements with ISPs, and attempted to obtain hashes from counter-defendants but were turned 
down. Collectively, these affirmative  [**20] steps are sufficient to demonstrate that Lime Wire had the ""requisite intention and 
preparedness"" to enter the digital distribution market, Indium, 611 Supp. at 385, and that it was ""ready, willing, and able"" to 
operate as a retail distributor of counter-defendants' music, id. at 385 n.14 (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, although Lime Wire 
is only a prospective retail distributor, it may nevertheless assert damages as a ""business"" under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
See 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law P 349, at 225 (3d ed. 2007) (noting that Clayton Act § 4's ""business or property""

collectively ""pool[ed] their copyrights"" to fix prices at both the wholesale and retail levels. (FAC P 36.) Accordingly, for purposes 
of this opinion, retail distributors of counter-defendants' music are intrabrand competitors, while interbrand competition is 
provided by retailers that sell music by ""independent labels and artists"" not affiliated with counter-defendants. (Id. P 44.)"
1591,18," Although a prospective competitor may have antitrust standing to challenge anticompetitive conduct that directly

illegal means, and pressured artists not to license their works to providers of P2P software that were not owned or controlled by

claims of ""price fixing"" and ""group boycott."" (Counter-P. Mem. 15.) See In re European Rail Pass Antitrust Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 
836, 844 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (noting that in antitrust cases governed by per se analysis, ""it is well settled that plaintiff is excused 
from defining the relevant product market"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). As explained above, however, Lime Wire has not 
established standing to challenge any of counter-defendants' alleged price fixing schemes. Moreover, counter-defendants' 
mandatory licensing regime does not constitute a ""group boycott"" -- i.e., an unlawful agreement among horizontal competitors to 
pressure a supplier or customer not to deal with another competitor. Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationary & 
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 293-94, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985); Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 800. Such boycotts are per 
se unlawful because they involve concerted action by competitors ""to protect their own  [**45] turf."" Lawrence A. Sullivan & 
Warren S. Grimes, The Law of Antitrust § 5.8b, at 299 (2d ed. 2006); see FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458,

expanded indiscriminately, and the per se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with market power 
boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing business with a competitor""). In contrast, counter-
defendants' mandatory licensing requirement is not aimed at excluding horizontal competitors, but rather, constitutes an effort ""to 
impose terms they concertedly favor on vertically related buyers,"" and thus ""evoke quite different policy. questions"" from the 
""classic boycott."" Sullivan, The Law of Antitrust § 5.8b, at 299. Such concerted refusals to deal are analyzed under the rule of 
reason, see Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-459, and thus Lime Wire must plead a relevant market to survive 
counter-defendants' motion to dismiss. "
1596,25," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1596,26," Thus, although the FAC alleges an actual business combination formed by defendants -- i.e., MusicNet and pressplay (FAC P 
34) -- Lime Wire cannot rely on this counter-allegation because it lacks standing to challenge any restraints related to the joint 
ventures."
1596,27," See, e.g., FAC 46 (alleging that ""Counter-Defendants and their co-conspirators have concertedly … refused to do business 
and have denied Lime Wire reasonable access to the hashes of their copyrighted works""); id. (alleging that ""Altnet … conspired 
with [counter-defendants] to 'force' Lime Wire and other P2P companies to enter into a license with Altnet in order to obtain the[] 
necessary hashes""). "
1597,28," Lime Wire relies heavily on Primetime 24 Joint Venture v. NBC, in which the Second Circuit held that a plaintiff satellite 
broadcaster's allegation that the major television networks concertedly refused to issue it licenses to copyrighted programs 
stated a § I claim. 219 F.3d at 103-04. (Counter-P. Mem. 21-22.) The plaintiff in Primetime 24, however, explicitly alleged facts 
plausibly suggestive of a conspiracy. See id. at 102 (alleging that networks' affiliates ""sent identical rejection letters,"" and that 
two networks ""specifically  [**53] discouraged their affiliated stations from dealing with [plaintiff]""). The FAC, in contrast, contains 
no such facts from which an agreement among counter-defendants can plausibly be inferred."
1597,29," Indeed, as sellers of hashes, counter-defendants, at least in the absence of other economic reasons to restrict their pool of 
distributors, see, e.g., GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 54-55 (discussing potential efficiency gains from vertical non-price restraints), 
would prefer to have more buyers to bid up the price for hashes and reduce the ability of any one buyer to exert significant 
market power, see Todd, 275 F.3d at 202 (""A greater availability of substitute buyers indicates  [**55] a smaller quantum of 
market power on the part of the buyers in question.""). Counter-defendants' alleged refusal to sell hashes to any retailer without a 
license from Altnet would thus arguably depress the price for hashes, hardly an incentive for counter-defendants to conspire to 
take such action. Presumably then, a record company would only require a buyer of hashes to obtain a license from Altnet if that 
company determined that Altnet's patents were valid; otherwise, it would solicit bids from a larger pool of buyers, and thus be 
able to sell its hashes for a higher price. "
1598,30," Lime Wire also alleges that the joint ventures ""provided a forum in which executives of the parent distribution companies met 
to discuss their own pricing and prices of competitors."" (FAC P 38.) Although is not entirely clear from the FAC whether counter-
defendants had already divested their interests in the joint ventures by the time they implemented the licensing requirement (see 
id. P 39), even assuming arguendo that they had not divested their interests, it is well settled that HN19[
] ""the mere 
opportunity to conspire does not by itself support the inference that such an illegal combination actually occurred."" See

1600,35," HN24[
] Under § 1367(c), a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if: (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law, (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction, (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction."
1600,28, U.S.C. § 1367(c). 
1601,36," Although § 1367(c)(3) authorizes a court to decline supplemental jurisdiction only where ""the district court has dismissed all 
claims over which it has original jurisdiction,"" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) (emphasis added), a literal application of that rule might 
lead to an anomalous result where, as here, the defendant's state law counterclaims share a ""common nucleus"" of facts, not with 
the federal claims asserted in the plaintiff's complaint, but rather, with its own federal counterclaims. Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 725. 
Because a federal counterclaim may be heard in federal court without being ""part of the same case"" as the federal claim in 
 [**68] the plaintiff's complaint, 28 U.S.C. 1367(a), a defendant with a state law counterclaim that could not be brought 
independently in federal court may nevertheless be able to secure a federal forum for that claim by bootstrapping it onto a 
federal counterclaim that shares a ""common nucleus"" of facts with its state law counterclaim. Even if the federal counterclaim is 
later dismissed, a literal application of § 1367(c)(3) in this context would render that subsection unavailable as a basis for 
declining supplemental jurisdiction because the court would still retain ""original jurisdiction"" over the federal claim in the plaintiff's 
complaint. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); see Pro Bono Investments, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22348, 2005 WL 2429787, at *14. Such an 
interpretation of § 1367(c)(3) would thus encourage defendants with state law counterclaims that could not otherwise be brought 
in federal court to bring weak (but not frivolous or insubstantial, see Nowak, 81 F.3d at 1188-89) federal counterclaims to 
strategically take advantage of this boot-strapping procedure. The Court need not decide whether this interpretation of § 
1367(c)(3) is correct, however, because even if that subsection is inapplicable on its face, the Court  [**69] concludes that, 
pursuant to § 1367(c)(4), supplemental jurisdiction over Lime Wire's remaining state law claims should not be exercised. See 
infra at 41-43. "
1602,37," Although Lime Wire has raised an affirmative defense of ""copyright misuse"" (D. Corrected First Amended Ans. 12), it is not

Lime Wire's state law counterclaims. Indeed, Lime Wire itself has not asserted, much less demonstrated, that such a factual 
relationship exists. Within the Second Circuit,  [**72] moreover, HN27[

appear that the Plaintiff ""argued as. opposed to stipulated."" Plaintiffs Objections to Proposed Order, p. 11. The Court was 
unaware of the Plaintiff's subsequent stipulation at the time it tendered the opinion letter, and thus relied upon the arguments of 
counsel at the August 28, 2007 hearing in rendering its decision. As the ultimate result is the same, namely dismissal of the 
claims with prejudice, the Court finds no reason to omit that portion of the Order dealing with the statutory claims, as it properly 
based its decision on the information presented in the pleadings and at the August 28, 2007 hearing, rather than on the 
subsequent position of the Plaintiff. "
1608,3," The Court notes the receipt of Plaintiff's Objections to Proposed Order Granting Defendant's Motions to Dismiss, or in the 
Alternative, Plaintiff's Motion to Permit Discovery to Proceed, Motion to Amend the Complaint, and Motion to Enforce Settlement 
Agreement, as well as a Response submitted on behalf of the Defendants in opposition thereto. Having considered the same, 
the Court has edited the proposed order submitted by the Defendants, and Plaintiffs alternative motions are therefore denied. 
The Court would further note that as no formal settlement was presented to the Court prior to its dismissal of the suit, the issue 
of whether any enforceable [*15]  settlement exists between the parties in this case is not properly before the Court at this time. "
1609,1," On a motion to dismiss, the court accepts the allegations of the complaint as being true and views them in a light most

out are drawn from the plaintiffs' complaint. "

1626,3," Motiva's counterclaim alleged that Wyatt had breached the contract when, ""[w]ithout proper cause, [it] unilaterally terminated

1627,5," On September 27, 2002, the court deemed counts one through four of Wyatt's complaint arbitrable, but Wyatt later withdrew

three of Motiva's counterclaim were withdrawn in November, 2003."
1627,6," Wyatt also filed several motions after the court found in favor of Motiva on the counterclaim but failed to seek an articulation as 
to the basis for court's decision to try the breach of contract counterclaim."
1627,7," In this appeal, Wyatt does not claim that the trial court improperly granted Motiva's motion for summary judgment on Wyatt's 
special defense on the ground that summary judgment is not a proper vehicle for eliminating a special defense, where judgment 
is not rendered on either a complaint or a counterclaim as a result of the rejection of the special defense. We note, however, that

42), 2007 Conn. Super. LEXIS 642. Because this procedural aspect is not addressed by either party, we will proceed to review 
Wyatt's substantive claim on appeal. "
1628,8," On appeal, Motiva argues that the interposition of an illegality defense based on antitrust violations in a breach of contract 
action is disfavored by the federal courts, citing Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 79 S. Ct. 429, 3 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1959). 
 [***12] The Kelly case is distinguishable from the factual setting of the present case. Kelly involved a contract for the sale of 
onions, which the purchaser had received but had not paid for. Id., 516-17. The purchaser interposed the seller's antitrust 
violations as a defense to payment. Id., 516. The Kelly court would not consider the defense where the purchaser had received 
the goods, noting that ""[p]ast the point where the judgment of the Court would itself be enforcing the precise conduct made 
unlawful by the [Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.], the courts are to be guided by the overriding general policy, as 
Mr. Justice Holmes put it, 'of preventing people from getting other people's property for nothing when they purport to be buying 
it.' Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Louis Voight & Sons Co., [212 U.S. 227, 271, 29 S. Ct. 280, 53 L. Ed. 486, 6 Ohio L. Rep. 665 
(1909) (Holmes, J. dissenting)]."" Kelly v. Kosuga, supra, 520-21. The present case does not involve a contract for the sale of goods but rather a contract that grants Motiva exclusive marking 
rights to put gasoline through the Wyatt terminal and contains an endeavor clause, in which Motiva agreed that it would 
endeavor to keep the rates  [***13] at the Wyatt terminal the same as at another terminal Motiva owned in Bridgeport. See 
footnote 11. Unlike Kelly, no benefit would continue to accrue to Wyatt upon the termination of the contract. Accordingly, we are 
not persuaded by Motiva's argument. We cannot find any case law indicating that Connecticut would adopt such a position in 
this case with regard to alleged violations of the Connecticut Antitrust Act. Our review of Texas law reveals that Texas has not adopted the position of the federal courts. Rather, according to Texas law, 
an antitrust defense can be interposed. See, e.g., Savin Corp. v. Copy Distributing Co., 716 S.W.2d 690, 691 (Tex. Civ. App. 
1986); Federal Parts Corp. v. Robert Bosch Corp., 604 S.W.2d 367, 370 (Tex. Civ. App. 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (""[A] contract or 
transaction in violation of the antitrust statutes is void and unenforceable. . . . Accordingly, [the defendant] was entitled to 
proceed on its affirmative defense on the legal theory of antitrust violations committed by [the plaintiff]."")."
1628,9," In its appellate brief, Wyatt addresses the portion of its illegality defense concerning Connecticut antitrust violations, and, 
therefore, we also only address the Connecticut Antitrust Act. In its special defense, Wyatt alleged, inter alia, violations of General Statutes §§ 35-26, 35-27 and 35-29 of the Connecticut 
Antitrust  [***15] Act. HN3[
] Section 35-26 provides that ""[e]very contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."" General Statutes § 35-26. Section 35-27 provides that ""[e]very contract, combination, or 
conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."" General 
Statutes § 35-27. "
1629,10," To the extent that Motiva argues that the law of the chosen state is applicable, citing Zenon v. R. E. Yeagher Management 
Corp., supra, 57 Conn. App. 316, we find that case to be inapposite. First, we note that Zenon concerns the law to be applied in 
determining the enforceability of an illegal contract and not the law to be applied in determining, as a threshold matter, the 
existence of illegality. Id., 328-29; 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws § 202, comment (c), p. 645 (1971). In addition, the 
parties in that case agreed that Massachusetts law applied to the plaintiff's claim for nonpayment of a promissory note, which 
was a part of an illegal arrangement to avoid Massachusetts' liquor licensing laws for a  [***18] property located in 
Massachusetts. Zenon v. R. E. Yeagher Management Corp., supra, 318-21. "
1630,11," The exclusivity provision of the terminalling agreement provided in relevant part: ""Wyatt agrees that at any time during the 
term of this Agreement, all current or future gasoline truck loading racks within the Facility or any other facility obtained by 
purchase or lease by Wyatt or its affiliates located in New Haven, [Connecticut] shall be dedicated for use by [Motiva] or its 
Customers."" The terminalling agreement also provided that Motiva would ""endeavor"" to keep rates the same at the Wyatt terminal as in the 
Bridgeport terminal, which Motiva also owned. "
1631,12," A fact finder could conclude that the exclusive rights granted to Motiva to put gasoline through the Wyatt terminal and the 
language in the agreement, stating that Motiva would endeavor to keep rates the same at the Wyatt terminal as at the Bridgeport 
terminal did not violate antitrust laws. However, in light of the factual disputes between the parties, a fact finder could conclude 
that, with the later acquisition of the Cargill terminal, the terminalling agreement between Wyatt and Motiva contributed to 
antitrust violations. Wyatt, accordingly, had an interest in being able to put on that defense at trial because, as a party to a 
contract that created such a potentially violative combination, it might have exposure under our antitrust laws. "
1633,1," On August 2, 2007, the Court dismissed Orix Capital Markets Partnership from the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil

1634,3," Both Wells Fargo and Orix point out that Orix foreclosed on a Louisiana apartment building which served as collateral for a loan

1636,4," While the Court has not relied on these arguments, Wells Fargo contends that Arjmandi  [*16] is incompetent to testify because

with the market value of the certificates, which Wells Fargo claims is a prerequisite to testimony by an owner. (Id.)."
1636,5," SFE listed the following categories of damages: ""(a) Amounts overbilled to the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, an amount in excess

The amount of profits the ORIX Conspirators gained through sale of the improperly inflated and continued 'B pieces,' an amount

by ORIX with Wells Fargo's blessing, an amount to be discovered. (h) Amounts gained by Defendants from improper foreclosure 
on performing loans or by reselling foreclosed properties to itself or entities with which Defendants had an affiliation, an amount 
to be discovered. (i) The value of Wells Fargo's 'Master Servicing Right' assets attributable to its involvement with the MLMI and 
FULBBA Trusts, an amount to be discovered."" (Orix App. 473; similar list at Wells Fargo Sealed App. 11)."
1637,6," SFE listed the following  [*19] categories of damages: ""(a) Amounts of master servicing, special servicing, trustee, and other 
fees (such as modification fees, late charges, default interest, and defeasance fees), paid to Defendants in connection with their 
activities for the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, an amount exceeding $ 29,355,497. (b) Amounts of interest paid to Defendants on 
advances and expenses (including principal and interest advances, litigation advances, and custodial balances), an amount 
exceeding $ 1,865,814. (c) The purchase price of the MLMI and FULBBA Certificates purchased by SFE, an amount of $ 
165,000, or their diminishment in value, an amount no less than $ 24,700. (d) Distribution payments made to the ORIX 
Defendants with respect to their 'B Pieces,' an amount no less than $ 20,000,000. (e) The amount of profits the ORIX 
Defendants gained through sale of their 'B pieces' in the MLMI and FULBBA Trust, an amount no less than $ 40,000,000. (f) 
Amounts gained by Defendants from sale of collateral properties for liquidated loans not credited to the Trusts, an amount no 
less than $ 4,500,000. (g) Any other gains or profits or benefits Defendants received in connection with their activities for the 
MLMI  [*20] and FULBBA Trusts, such as diverting settlement amounts through non-Trust accounts or improper purchases of 
Trust assets. (h) Any tax penalties suffered by SFE as a result of improper actions of the Defendants in connection with 
administering the Trusts. (i) The value of Wells Fargo's 'Mortgage Servicing Right' assets attributable to its involvement with the 
MLMI and FULBBA Trusts."" (Orix App. 478; Wells Fargo App. 1432). "
1639,7, SFE did not file a response to Orix or Wells Fargo's motion to strike evidence. 
1640,8," The Court need not consider  [*30] the Defendants' other motions to exclude SFE's evidence because it finds in favor of the 
Defendants on all of SFE's claims. "
1641,9," Orix cited Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. Murat Holdings, LLC, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 7576, 2006 WL 2458563, at *5 (Tex. App.--Dallas 
2006) for the proposition that the tort claims should be governed by Texas law because they depend upon an ""'interpretation and 
enforcement' of the PSA's."" However, this opinion was subsequently withdrawn and substituted with an opinion stating, ""A 
choice of law provision in a contract that applies only to the interpretation and enforcement of the contract does not govern tort 
claims."" Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. Murat Holding, LL, 223 S.W.3d 676, 684 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2007, no pet. h.) (citing Stier v. 
Reading & Bates Corp., 992 S.W.2d 423, 433 (Tex. 1999)).  [*35] In Red Roof Inns, the Court held that even though the 
franchise agreement contained a choice of law provision in favor of Ohio law, the claims for tortious interference, Louisiana 
Unfair Trade Practices Act violation, fraud/negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty would be governed by 
Louisiana law. Id. at 685. The breach of fiduciary duty claim was based on the actions and statements of the officers in 
inspecting the hotel and the fraud/negligent misrepresentation claim was based on failure to disclose certain information. Id. "
1643,10," SFE appears to abandon its argument that its damages include potential tax consequences to the certificate holders because 
it does not mention this alleged injury in its responses. SFE's expert has conceded that he is unaware that Wells Fargo failed to 
comply with tax regulations to the detriment of the Trusts. (Wells Fargo App. 42). "
1644,11," In its response, SFE points to Arjmandi's declaration discussing the Charles Schwab account records and the Charles Schwab 
account records themselves. (SFE App. 576-97). To the extent that SFE contends that the account records alone are sufficient 
evidence of injury, the Court rejects this argument because these records should be excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 
702. In Van Der AA Investments, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 125 T.C. 1, at *4 (T.C. 2005), the Court refused to consider 
as evidence on a motion for summary judgment an Arthur Anderson report describing the fair market value of the company. The 
report was supported by  [*47] an affidavit of an officer of the company stating that the company had engaged Arthur Anderson 
to determine this value. Id. The Court reasoned that since the author had relied on specialized knowledge to prepare the report, 
it would not be admissible unless the author was testifying as an expert. Id. at *6 (citing FED. R. EVID. 702). Allowing the 
introduction of the report ""would allow the introduction of opinion testimony by lay witnesses in the form of a report as to 
scientific, technical, or other specialized matters and would allow an expert to express his opinions in a report without being 
subject to cross-examination on the facts and data underlying that opinion."" Id. In this case, admitting the Charles Schwab 
account records would allow SFE to present evidence of the value of the certificates without giving the Defendants the 
opportunity to cross-examine the author of the report. Wells Fargo made a similar argument with respect to Arjmandi's 
declaration. (Wells Fargo's Reply 7-8 (citing FED. R. EVID. 702; Wilson v. Woods, 163 F.3d 935, 937 (5th Cir. 1999)) (""Rather, 
he [Arjmandi] admits he simply downloaded and presented as expert evidence account statements from Charles Schwab. 
 [*48] In other words, rather than presenting an expert whose opinions and methodology could be scrutinized, Mr. Arjmandi 
simply reads the opinion of a third party [the Charles Schwab report] who proffers a 'market value' from time to time, without any 
explanation of how that term is defined, how the opinion is developed or the qualification of the individual developing it. This is 
no evidence and should be disregarded.""). Wells Fargo did not specifically raise this objection with respect to the Charles 
Schwab account statements themselves; however, this Court may raise the issue of the admissibility of evidence sua sponte. 
See United States v. Wallace, 972 F.2d 344, at *3. (4th Cir. 1992). "
1645,12," The Court recognizes that there is a distinction between showing the existence of damages and quantifying those damages 
and that a plaintiff need not present evidence quantifying its damages. Potomac Elec. Co. v. Electric Motor & Supply, Inc., 262 
F.3d 260, 265 (4th Cir. 2001); see also Dyll v. Adams, 167 F.3d 945, 947 (5th Cir. 1999) (applying Texas law) (quoting McKnight 
v. Hill & Hill Exterminators, 689 S.W.2d 206, 207 (Tex. 1985) (""Uncertainty as to the fact of legal damages is fatal to recovery, 
but uncertainty as to the amount will not defeat recovery."") However, the Court finds that SFE has not provided sufficient 
evidence to show the existence of damages. "
1646,13," Wells Fargo moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence that their conduct caused the alleged 
decline in the market value of the certificates, and Orix made this argument in its Reply Brief (Wells Fargo's Br. 16, Orix's Reply 
5-6). "
1647,14," The standard for summary judgment mirrors the standard for a directed verdict and requires ""sufficient evidence favoring the 
nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 
2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)."
1647,15," The interrogatory stated: ""Please state the amounts of monies paid by the MLMI Trust to ORIX Capital Markets, LLC as 
Servicer and/or Special Servicer for each year the inception of the MLMI Trust to the present for each of the following: (a) 
repayment of principal and interest (P&I) advances; (b) repayment of litigation expenses; (c) repayment of other advances; (d) "
1648,," interest paid on P & I advances, advances for litigation expenses, and other servicing advances; (e) fees for serving as master 
servicer; (f)  [*62] fees for serving as special servicer and (g) any other fees or reimbursement of expenses."" (SFE App. 1551-
52). The interrogatory for the FULBBA trust was almost identical. (SFE App. 1558-59)."
1648,16," SFE also cites pages 237-76 of its appendix in support of disgorgement damages against Orix and Wells Fargo. This citation 
is to several pages of graphs with no label or any explanation of what these documents are. The Court will disregard this 
evidence."
1648,17," Because the Court has granted the Defendants' motions for summary judgment on all of SFE's 'claims, it is unnecessary for 
the Court to consider the other grounds for summary judgment. "
1659,1," In its brief, Plaintiff does discuss whether the enforceability of section 13.D of the franchise agreement is governed by the 
federal Sherman Act or the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act. See Pl. Br. at 19-23. We find this discussion to be misguided 
because, as indicated above, we must apply state law to the substantive claim in a diversity  [**12] action. Moreover, Plaintiff's 
distinction is unhelpful, because, as Plaintiff correctly argues, both federal and Michigan antitrust law apply the same 
reasonableness test to determine the validity of non-compete agreements. "
1662,2," Plaintiff spends a significant portion of its brief arguing that it did not have the burden to demonstrate that the non-compete 
clause was reasonable, but rather that Defendants bore the burden of showing the clause's unreasonableness. See Pl. Br. at 
19-23. Plaintiff then contends that, by not countering Plaintiff's claim that the covenant was reasonable in the district court, 
Defendants have failed to preserve for appeal any objection to the reasonableness of the covenant not to compete. See id. at 
25-26. We find this argument to be without merit. HN10[
] Michigan law is clear that ""[t]he burden of demonstrating the validity of the 
agreement is on the party seeking enforcement."" Coates, 276 Mich. App. 498, 2007 WL 2452721, at *4. Moreover, in seeking a 
preliminary  [**25] injunction, a federal plaintiff has the burden of establishing the likelihood of success on the merits. See 
Tumblebus, 399 F.3d at 760. Accordingly, Plaintiff, not Defendants, had the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the 
non-compete clause. "
1663,3," Under Michigan court rules, ""[a]n unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding under the rule of stare decisis."" Mich. App. 
R. 7.215 (1985). Nevertheless, these opinions are useful for our purpose of predicting how a Michigan court would resolve a 
similar issue. "
1672,1," Radioshack submits for consideration the Franchise Agreement entered into between Tandy Corp. and plaintiff Stillwell in 
1998. Plaintiffs object to the court's consideration of this and the other exhibits attached to the McNeill declaration. The court 
declines to consider these extraneous documents on a motion to dismiss. Levine, 950 F.2d at 1482. The complaint only attaches 
and refers to the form Franchise Agreement attached to the complaint, not the agreements submitted by Radioshack. "
1673,2," The issues raised by Radioshack are better addressed by means of an evidentiary motion, not a motion to dismiss. "
1674,3," The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936 as an amendment to the Clayton Act. ""The Clayton Act is an antitrust law that 
primarily protected against 'primary line' price discrimination, or price discrimination tending to injure the price discriminator's 
competitors."" Lewis v. Philip Morris Inc., 355 F.3d 515, 520 (6 Cir.2004). Congress passed the Robinson-Patman Act to ""protect "
1675,," small retail stores from the concentrated buying power of larger chain stores."" Id. at 520. The Act was intended to ""curb and 
prohibit all devices by which large buyers gained discriminatory preferences over smaller ones by virtue of their greater 
purchasing power."" Id."
1675,4," In addition, and separate from the prima facie case, plaintiffs must also establish ""antitrust injury,"" which is ""actual injury 
attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent."" J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 
557, 562, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). "
1677,5," The court apologizes to the parties and counsel for the inadvertent delay in the issuance of this order. This court acknowledges 
that this motion has been pending for an unreasonably long time and advises the parties and counsel that this case will be 
expeditiously managed in the future. The court appreciates the patience the parties and counsel have shown. "
1682,1," The Designated Defendants filed three other motions for summary judgment on different grounds, all of which were addressed 
in the January 25 Order. Because the defendants' damages motion is the only one relevant to the present motion, the Court 
shall limit its discussion of the January 25 Order to that motion. "
1683,2," Although the defendants filed a nominal opposition to the plaintiffs' Rule 59(e) motion, they do not dispute that the plaintiffs' 
complaints do seek such relief, but simply maintain that ""Plaintiffs are entitled to no such relief,"" a contention which is relevant to 
the motion for summary judgment currently pending but does not undermine the plaintiffs' point that the January 25 Order 
incorrectly characterized their case as seeking only money damages. Designated Defendants' Memorandum of Law in 
Response to Representative Plaintiffs' Motion to Correct a Mistake or Error in, or in the Alternative, to Alter or Amend, a 
Judgment or Order (docket no. 530), at 2. The plaintiffs' Rule 59(e) motion is therefore granted, and the Court shall issue an 
amended order correcting the language of footnote 42. "
1684,3," Prior to the enactment of Section 16 of the Clayton Act, the Supreme Court had held, on the basis of an application of the 
canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius to the text of Section 4 of the Sherman Act, that injunctive relief against anticipated 
violations of the antitrust laws was not available to private plaintiffs.  [*13] See Minnesota v. Northern Sec. Co., 194 U.S. 48, 70-
71, 24 S. Ct. 598, 48 L. Ed. 870 (1904) (""We cannot suppose it was intended that the enforcement of the act should depend in 
any degree upon original suits in equity instituted by the states or by individuals to prevent violations of its provisions. On the 
contrary . . . we think that its intention was to limit direct proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations of the anti-
trust act as cause injury to the general public . . . to those instituted in the name of the United States . . . by district attorneys of 
the United States, acting under the direction of the Attorney General . . . .""); Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, 244 U.S. 459, 471, 37 S. 
Ct. 718, 61 L. Ed. 1256 (1917) (Holmes, J.) (""[I]f the facts show any violation of the [Sherman Act], a private person cannot 
maintain a suit for an injunction under § 4 of the same. . . ."") (Holmes, J.). Three Justices dissented from the Court's holding in 
Paine Lumber, arguing that ""in the absence of some provision to the contrary, the right to relief by injunction, where irreparable 
injury is threatened through a violation of property rights, and there is no adequate remedy at law, rests upon settled principles of 
equity that were recognized  [*14] in the constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the courts of the United States."" Id. at 473 (Pitney, 
J., dissenting). "
1685,4," Datagate further noted that ""[t]o establish a claim for injunctive relief under section 16, Datagate must demonstrate 'a 
cognizable danger' of injury not just a 'mere possibility,'"" and noted that evidence of customers' complaints about the new HP 
policy, while not sufficient to establish actual injury, ""may be indicative of a threat of injury."" Id. (quoting TRW, Inc. v. FTC, 647 
F.2d 942, 954 (9th Cir. 1981))."
1685,5," Courts occasionally refer to the question whether a plaintiff has alleged or proven an antitrust injury as a question of ""standing,"" 
but such phrasing is imprecise. Although the inquiries into antitrust injury and antitrust standing often overlap, HN5[
] the antitrust injury component of a Section 4 or Section 16 claim, as discussed further below, requires a determination of whether "
1686,," the injury alleged by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's violation of the antitrust laws is the kind of harm that the antitrust 
laws were intended to prevent, while the antitrust standing inquiry examines whether the plaintiff is the most efficient party to 
prosecute the action. See generally William H. Page, The Scope of Liability for Antitrust Violations, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1445 (1985), 
cited in Cargill, 479 U.S. at 110 n. 5; see also Disenos Artisticos E Industriales, S.A. v. Work, 676 F. Supp. 1254, 1275 n. 18 
(E.D.N.Y. 1987) (Glasser, J.) (citing Page)."
1686,6," Section 7 of the Clayton Act states in relevant part: No person engaged  [*21] in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole 
or any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission 
shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting 
commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
1686,15, U.S.C. § 18.
1686,7," I.e., an owner and operator of plants for the slaughter of cattle and the fabrication of beef. "
1687,8," Cargill incorrectly quotes Brunswick as defining antitrust injury as an injury of the sort that the antitrust laws were ""designed"" to 
prevent; Brunswick actually uses the word ""intended"" rather than ""designed."" Compare Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489, with Cargill, 
479 U.S. at 113. Given that the words ""designed"" and ""intended"" are synonymous in this context, this Court does not infer any 
difference in meaning in the definitions of antitrust injury adopted by Brunswick and Cargill; indeed, it is clear that the Cargill 
Court intended to incorporate the concept of antitrust injury as defined in Brunswick into the context of a Section 16 claim."
1687,9," The Second Circuit expressly recognized this distinction in Consol. Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco, S.A., 871 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 
1989). In that case, the plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction from the  [*28] district court against a hostile takeover, arguing 
that the hostile bidder would use its control over the plaintiff following the takeover to shut down the plaintiff's gold mining 
operations, thereby reducing competition in the market. After a brief discussion of Cargill, the Second Circuit affirmed the district "
1688,," court's determination that the plaintiff had alleged a threat of antitrust injury sufficient to seek injunctive relief under Section 16, 
noting that the plaintiff's contention ""that it would suffer reduced profits because the takeover will enable outside corporate forces 
to cause it to restrain its own competitiveness and thereby reduce competition in the relevant market . . . is precisely the type 
that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against."" Id. at 257-58."
1688,10," In seeking to distinguish Hayden from the present case, the Designated Defendants place peculiarly heavy emphasis on the 
fact that the Hayden court ultimately affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendants, albeit on grounds that are 
concededly not present in this case. See Def. Mem. at 11 (""First, the Second Circuit in Hayden affirmed the grant of summary 
judgment as to plaintiffs' claim  [*31] for injunctive relief, albeit on different grounds.""); Reply Mem. at 13 (""Defendants find it 
curious that Plaintiffs continue to rely on a case which affirmed the grant of summary judgment as to the plaintiff's claim for an 
injunction and in which the claimant actually proffered evidence of competitors receiving a lower price . . . ."") (emphasis in 
original). The Court is somewhat at a loss to comprehend why the Designated Defendants apparently view the ultimate outcome 
of Hayden to be of such significance in undermining the Designated Plaintiffs' Section 16 claim when there is no doubt in this 
case that, unlike Hayden, the Designated Plaintiffs continue to purchase the Designated Defendants' BNPDs. Obviously, this 
Court is aware of the fact that defendants' motions for summary judgment in antitrust actions are sometimes granted, and is 
capable of appreciating that the legal reasoning applied by one case might dictate a different outcome in a subsequent case in 
which the facts found to be dispositive in the first case are not present. The Court therefore would have found a more 
substantive discussion of the Hayden court's reasoning to be a much more useful undertaking on the Designated 
 [*32] Defendants' part than their talismanic invocation of Hayden's bottom line. "
1689,11," The district and circuit court opinions in B-S Steel follow the pattern, addressed in note 5, supra, of discussing the question of 
antitrust injury in terms of ""standing"" rather than as a substantive  [*34] element of the cause of action. However, as the 
subsequent discussion shall demonstrate, the Tenth Circuit's analysis of the issue is essentially identical to that of other cases, 
including Hayden, which, correctly in this Court's view, treat the question of antitrust injury as a substantive element of an 
antitrust claim."
1689,12," Vintage tires are ""replicas of the tires which originally were sold on vintage, antique and collector cars, and are no longer made 
for use on modern cars."" Id. at 1230. "
1691,13," See Reply Mem. at 3 (""[N]ot once did the Defendants argue that a failure to prove damages, in and of itself, precludes 
injunctive relief."")."
1691,14," For example, the Designated Defendants' moving brief argues on the first page that ""[w]hether [the plaintiffs] seek monetary 
damages or equitable relief in the form of an injunction, the law is clear that proof of antitrust injury is an essential element of 
their claims."" Def. Mem. at 1; see also id. at 4 (""Whether [Plaintiffs] seek monetary damages or equitable relief in the form of an 
injunction, the law is clear that proof of antitrust injury is an essential element of their claims. Their failure to raise any genuine 
issue of material fact  [*45] as to antitrust injury requires granting Defendants summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' claims for 
declaratory and injunctive relief.""); id. (arguing that ""[t]he [January 25] Order could not have been more clear, and indeed, the 
Court found that Plaintiffs had failed in numerous ways to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to any of their damage 
theories,"" and arguing on the basis of that fact that the plaintiffs' ""failure to raise any genuine issue of material fact as to antitrust 
injury requires granting Defendants summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.""). "
1692,15," The court notes that the subsidy program at issue had been in effect since ""around 1962."" Thus, assuming the case was 
commenced in 1970, as the docket number of the district court proceeding (Civ. A. No. 2000-70) appears to indicate, the subsidy 
program had been in effect for about 8 years when the complaint was filed. "
1694,16," This  [*57] principle was also recognized in dicta by the Third Circuit in Van Dyk Research Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 631 F.2d 251 
(3d Cir. 1980). In that case, the plaintiff, which had been in business for approximately eleven years, approximately seven of 
which were spent as an aspiring competitor of Xerox in the photocopier market, brought an antitrust action seeking damages 
and injunctive relief against Xerox which alleged that Xerox's monopolistic control over the relevant market was the ultimate 
cause of the plaintiff's financial hardships and business misfortunes, which had driven the plaintiff to file for bankruptcy. 
Following a bench trial, the district court granted judgment for the defendant, finding that because Xerox had ""nothing to do"" with 
the plaintiff's failed business relationships and inability to secure adequate financing, the plaintiff could not establish a causal 
connection between Xerox's alleged violations of the antitrust laws and the plaintiff's alleged injury. Id. at 254. The Third Circuit 
affirmed the district court's determination, and noted that ""although injunctive relief may be appropriate where damages are not, 
in the circumstances present here, the failure to prove  [*58] the fact of injury is conclusive as to both forms of relief."" Id. at 255

1715,4," In addition to manufacturing to its own products, Tyco licensed its oximetry technology to several OEMs, including GE Medical 
Systems, Philips, Spacelabs and Siemens."
1715,5," Although GPOs negotiate sales contract terms on behalf of their members, it is the individual member hospitals themselves 
that directly purchase oximetry products. "
1716,6," Masimo alleged that such practices  [**20] further entrenched Tyco's installed base of pulse oximetry monitors and, because 
only Tyco sensors were compatible with Tyco monitors at that time, cemented Tyco's control over future revenue streams from 
consumables flowing from that base. According to Masimo, this prevented Masimo from selling oximetry products to hospitals 
belonging to GPOs in contractual relationships with Tyco, restrained hospitals not so encumbered from switching to rival 
oximetry monitors prior to the expiration of their financing agreements. and, collectively, excluded Masimo's from the pulse 
oximetry systems market. On Masimo's theory, Tyco's aggressive discounts enticed customers to enter into anticompetitive contracts that ensured Tyco's 
ongoing position as supplier of their oximetry needs. For example, under a typical market-share discount agreement, a hospital 
could receive a 40% discount on sensors if it agreed to purchase at least 90% of its oximetry requirements from Tyco. If hospital 
ultimately bought less than 90%, however, its discounts would be substantially reduced and the hospital might be precluded from 
receiving future discounts. Similarly, if a hospital purchased all of its pulse oximetry equipment  [**21] from Tyco pursuant to a 
sole-source agreement between Tyco and that hospital's GPO, the potential discounts could be even greater, but, there, too, 
penalties could potentially be applied if the hospital purchased any products from a Tyco competitor. "
1719,7," Dr. Beyer states on page 3 of his Affidavit that Plaintiffs asked him ""to determine whether information common to all members 
of the proposed class can be used to examine and determine: A. The relevant market or markets in this matter, B. Tyco's power 
in the relevant market or markets, and C. Whether and the extent to which Tyco exercised its power in the relevant market or 
markets to exclude, and/or forestall competition in the relevant market or markets."" He also states that Plaintiffs asked him ""to 
determine whether information common to members of the proposed Plaintiff Class can be used to determine the impact of 
Tyco's alleged anticompetitive conduct related to pulse oximetry sensors and cables…[or] whether common evidence exists to 
show that all or virtually all members of the proposed Class paid higher prices for pulse oximetry sensors and cables than they 
would  [**34] have paid absent the alleged anti-competitive conduct."""

1719,9," The Ninth Circuit recently held that a district court may not strike allegations from an amended complaint that contradict an 
earlier iteration of the same pleading because doing so ""effectively resolved those allegations on the merits."" PAE Gov't Servs. 
v. MPRI, Inc., No. 06-56438-RGK, 514 F.3d 856, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29221 (9th Cir. Dec. 18, 2007). In this case, the Court 
does not take any position on the merits of the current antitrust theory of harm advanced by the Plaintiffs in light of the previous 
iterations, but offers the full procedural  [**35] history of this action to demonstrate fully how the proposed class definition was 
reached. "
1720,10," Tyco does not dispute the fact that the numerosity or commonality requirements of Rule 23(a) are met here. The Court 
concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately shown numerosity because the class is estimated to constitute 7,000 geographically 
dispersed members. Plaintiffs have also met their burden to show commonality because common questions exist as to whether 
(1) Tyco possessed monopoly power in the relevant markets and (2) Tyco maintained its monopoly through willful and 
anticompetitive activity. "
1721,11," Tyco argues that Plaintiffs appear to be challenging other Tyco practices,  [**39] namely the Co-Op and OTIS equipment 
financing programs. Certainly Tyco is correct that Plaintiffs' experts provide opinions that those programs were used to maximize 
OxiMax monitor penetration. See, e.g., Damages Report of John C. Beyer, Ph.D. P47. Plaintiffs respond that they challenge 
these programs only insofar as they facilitated conversion to the OxiMax platform. In this view, but-for world purchasers of Tyco 
pulse oximetry products had available Co-Op and OTIS equipment financing programs. "
1722,12," Even in conspiracy cases courts have cautioned against simply presuming  [**45] class-wide impact on the basis of 
speculative expert testimony ""without any consideration of whether the markets or the alleged conspiracy at issue…actually 
operated in such a manner so as to justify that presumption."" Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d at 568 (quoting district court). "
1723,13," See, e.g., Section IV.A.2.d, infra."
1723,14," Plaintiffs appear to believe that they can avoid the more complicated question because, ""it defies economic logic to assume 
that any but the most insignificant purchasers would have been better off in the actual world than the but-for world when the 
actual average price for Tyco's adult sensor ($ 10) was 67% more than the average but-for price [$6] and when no more than ten 
R-Cal purchasers paid less than $ 8.00 on average during any fiscal quarter during the class period."" Pls.' New Reply Memo., at 
13-14. While the Court does not profess expertise in ""economic logic,"" it observes that there was a not insignificant number of 
purchasers at almost every price increment between $ 7.80 and $ 15 in the actual world in both 2003 and 2006. See Dr. Beyer 
Aff. at Table 2. If the same distribution is assumed in the but-for world with a 67% reduction in average price (i.e. $ 4 for each 
price point), then there  [**49] would be a not insignificant number of purchasers at almost every price increment between $ 3.80 
and $ 11. Thus, a number of purchasers in the but-for world (those paying between $ 7.80 and $ 11) could still be paying more 
than many purchasers did in the actual world despite the average price drop. To be clear, the Court is not suggesting that 
maintaining the same absolute distribution of prices is appropriate in the but-for world. It simply observes that given Plaintiffs' 
poorly reasoned and conclusory analyses, it seems impossible to conclude that only the most ""insignificant"" purchasers would 
be better off in the actual world using ""economic logic."" If the Plaintiffs purport to use the term ""insignificant"" to refer to the 
volume of purchases or some other metric, they have not presented an adequate explanation to the Court."
1723,15," The conclusion that Tyco's average price would have dropped $ 4, so that it exactly matched the generics - in other words, 
that Tyco could not charge any premium at all for its brand-name products - is also largely unsupported by the Plaintiffs. See 
Section IV.A.2.b, infra. The very documents that Dr. Beyer relies upon to establish his $ 6 average generic price also suggest 
that Tyco would continue to charge a premium for its own brand-name products. See Brody Decl., Exh. 4, at 62. The larger the 
premium Tyco could have charged, the more purchasers that could have been better off in the actual world. "
1724,16," In the example set out in Note 14, supra, those purchasers who paid between $ 7.80 and $ 11 in the but-for world may not 
have been harmed at all. "
1725,17," Plaintiffs  [**55] argue that ""Tyco has presented no valid empirical evidence to counter Dr. Beyer's empirical analysis"" that 
nearly every customer was overcharged. See Pls.' New Reply Memo., at 14. But it is Plaintiffs that have failed to meet their 
burden here by avoiding any meaningful analysis of Tyco's but-for prices in a world without OxiMax and without market-share 
and sole-source agreements. "
1726,18," Some hospitals that began purchasing from generic manufacturers switched back to Tyco, citing product quality problems with 
generic sensors. See Ordover Initial Decl. P 59, fn. 65, Ex's. 55-58."
1726,19," Unlike its generic competitors, Tyco validates its sensors' performance on all R-Cal monitors. See Ordover Initial Decl. P 37."
1726,20," See Defendant's New Opp., at 8-9. "
1727,21," As might be expected, Dr. Beyer does not consider that Tyco's strategy documents were simply wrong. "
1728,22," In his damages report, Dr. Beyer does present ""actual market results"" for generics, and finds average prices somewhat 
consistent with the Tyco documents, but the market shares entirely inconsistent. But he does not utilize actual market results to 
reach his conclusions on the but-for world, and instead draws primarily from Tyco documents. "
1729,23," Quantity price differentials are generally permissible when limited to the sphere of actual cost differences or when required to 
meet competition, and their legality in this market is not disputed by the parties. See generally Holmes. ANTITRUST LAW 
HANDBOOK § 4:4."
1729,24," If customers viewed Masimo's technology as differentiated from Tyco's R-Cal-based systems, then the entrance and wide 
availability of generic alternatives to R-Cal sensors would be expected to have, at best, only a limited effect on prices paid 
Masimo's proprietary sensors. This is because, until prices for the generic equivalents to Tyco's R-Cal-based sensors are set 
(assuming no hospitals viewed Tyco's R-Cal sensors as differentiated from generics) or succeed in driving prices of Tyco's 
brand-name R-Cal-based sensors (in this case, assuming the opposite) at or below the inflection point at which hospitals' 
preference for Masimo technology is outweighed by their  [**73] preference for superior pricing, Masimo would not be expected 
to match generic pricing. Moreover, individual hospitals undoubtedly exhibit slightly different demand curves described their 
preferences for Masimo systems in relation tc the price of competing technology. Thus, even if Masimo offered modest price 
decreases in the hopes of changing the location of the inflection point just mentioned, unless Plaintiffs show that generic pricing 
in the but-for world would have been set so low as to trigger a shift in the preferences of every hospital away from Masimo, the 
necessity of individualized evidence would remain."
1729,25," Because each GPO negotiates its own prices with Tyco on behalf of its members, including offering these unchallenged 
programs under discussion, it would be equally essential to identify the specific GPO to which each GPO-member hospital 
belonged to control for the effect of those incentives on their but-for price. "

1732,32," Importantly, this remains true even if Plaintiffs are correct that every direct purchaser of Tyco's pulse oximetry consumables 
suffered a degree of injury. Every overcharged purchaser will have a similar interest in proving Tyco liable; however, small 
hospitals able to obtain top tier pricing only with Tyco's market-share or sole-source discounts would be better served by 
attributing the anticompetitive effect solely to Tyco's OxiMax line (so as to retain the benefits of the contractual discounts in the 
but-for world); large hospitals with a preference for cutting-edge technology and sufficient volume requirements and bargaining 
 [**87] power to command top tier price without market-share or sole-source discounts would be better served by the opposite 
(so as to retain the clinical benefits of OxiMax sensors in the but-for world)."

(hereinafter ""Newberg"")."
1743,4," ""In considering the likely reaction of buyers to a price increase, the Agency will take into account all relevant evidence, 
including, but not limited to, the following: (1) evidence that buyers have shifted or have considered shifting purchases between 
products in response to relative changes in price or other competitive  [*18] variables; (2) evidence that sellers base business 
decisions on the prospect of buyer substitution between products in response to relative changes in price or other competitive 
variables; (3) the influence of downstream competition faced by buyers in their output markets; and (4) the timing and costs of 
switching products."" MERGER GUIDELINES § 1.1."
1743,5," In this example, the agencies would also consider what effect competing drugs would have on Alpha and Beta's ability to 
charge royalties on its processes. This caveat recognizes that downstream competition between two end-products (A and B) "
1744,," could prevent an  [*20] upstream supplier of inputs for A from imposing a price increase because otherwise consumers would 
exclusively purchase B. This consideration does not apply to the markets in this case because there do not appear to be any 
substitutes for DRAMs in making electronics. "
1745,6," As a preliminary matter, it is worth noting that the only alternatives to programmable CAS latency are fixed CAS latency or 
developing an asynchronous DRAM design. See McAlexander report, at 21-27. The various technologies listed by Dr. Gilbert - 
setting latency with one or more fuses, setting latency by antifusing, or identifying CAS latency with pin voltage - are all methods 
of achieving fixed CAS latency. Id. at 23-26. "
1746,7," Setting burst length with fuses, setting burst length with a dedicated pin, and controlling burst length with a burst terminate 
signal are all methods of fixing burst length; they are not alternatives to fixing burst length. See McAlexander report at 28-30. "
1747,8," Prof. Newberg proposed an additional factor, namely that ""substitute technologies are either unavailable or not as efficient as 
the technology comprising the candidate relevant market."" Newberg, 14 Harv. J. L. & Tech. at 107. This factor duplicates the 
process of defining the relevant technology market. "
1748,9," The court notes that the data Rambus relies on demonstrate Rambus's licensed share of various DRAM markets, not 
necessarily the  [*34] technology markets the Manufacturers now claim Rambus has monopolized. No one appears to argue, 
however, that the relevant technologies have any downstream use other than for manufacturing DRAMs."
1748,10," Scholarly economic and legal literature on technology, standard-setting, and antitrust is growing. A general background is 
helpfully provided by Prof. Mark Lemley. Intellectual Property Rights and Standard-Setting Organizations, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 1889 
(2002). Others have highlighted the risks of overzealous antitrust enforcement. David Teece & Edward Sherry, Standard Setting 
and Antitrust, 87 Minn. L. Rev. 1913 (2003) (Teece is an expert witness for Rambus). The most recent discussion of the topic is 
forthcoming in the Antitrust Law Journal. See Joseph Farrell, John Hayes, Carl Shapiro, and Theresa Sullivan, Standard 
Setting, Patents, and Hold-Up, available at: http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/standards2007.pdf (August 13, 2007) 
(Farrell, Hayes, and Sullivan have worked for Hynix in relation to this case). "
1749,11," At oral argument, the Manufacturers suggested that Rambus has worldwide market power because it requires licensees to 
pay royalties on DRAM sales everywhere in the world. Mr. Barza also argued that Rambus has global market power because ""if 
you cannot get into the U.S., then you're pretty much out of the market[.]"" While the arguments are probative as to global market 
power, the court has not been able to find any evidence in the record to support them, nor do the Manufacturers raise them in 
their opposition."
1749,12, Rambus's Daubert motion does not attack Dr. Gilbert's qualifications as an economist. 
1750,13," Establishing market definition in this case likely requires expert testimony. The Ninth Circuit has referred to market definition 
as a ""highly technical economic question."" Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., 924 F.2d 1484, 1490 (9th Cir. 
1991). Other courts have suggested that, ""[f]ailure to adduce expert testimony on competitive issues such as market definition 
augurs strongly in favor of granting summary judgment against an antitrust plaintiff."" Drs. Steuer and Latham, P.A. v. National 
Medical Enterprises, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 1489, 1512 n. 25 (D.S.C. 1987), aff'd mem, 846 F.2d 70 (4th Cir. 1988). The Eleventh 
Circuit has gone farther and held that ""[c]onstruction of the relevant market and a showing of monopoly power must be based on 
expert testimony."" Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 F.3d 1237, 1246 (11th Cir. 2002). While some courts  [*43] have permitted plaintiffs 
to establish market definitions without expert testimony, see, e.g., General Industries Corp. v. Hartz Mountain Corp., 810 F.2d 
795, 806 (1987), that is likely not appropriate in this case because while a technology market is, in the end, just another product 
market, its contours are difficult to define, as the DOJ and FTC have recognized. See IP GUIDELINES § 3.2.2 (noting the agencies 
will delineate technology markets ""if the data permit""). Given the complexity of the task, a jury likely cannot conclude that two 
technologies are ""close substitutes"" and hence comprise a relevant technology market without expert testimony. "

litigation, which is still pending in the California Supreme Court, case No. S140547. We do not rely on the opinion as legal 
precedent. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115.) "
1786,3," After a sustained yield plan is submitted and the Director of the CDF determines that it contains sufficient and complete 
information to permit further review, a 90-day review and comment period ensues, which includes the holding of a public 
hearing, after which the director decides  [***7] whether to accept or reject the plan. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 1091.10, subds. 
(a)–(e).) The director's decision is subject to an administrative appeals process and, ultimately, to judicial review. (Cal. Code 
Regs., tit. 14, § 1091.11; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 1091.10; Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.) Here, the draft documents available for public review included a combined habitat conservation plan and sustained yield plan, 
and an environmental impact statement and environmental impact report. "
1788,4," An exception to the litigation privilege exists where the communication was made in connection with judicial or quasi-judicial 
proceedings not instigated in good faith. (E.g., Action Apartment, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.) Here, however, no such lack of 
good faith has been alleged with respect  [***14] to Pacific Lumber's petitioning of the government in connection with the 
Headwaters Agreement. As such, we have no reason to consider this exception. "
1789,*," Reporter's Note: For Supreme Court opinion, filed July 17, 2008, see 44 Cal.4th 459."
1789,5," On this point, the California Supreme Court appears to reject language in two of the State's authorities, Kashian v. Harriman, 
supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at page 924, and American Products Co., Inc. v. Law Offices of Geller, Stewart & Foley, LLP (2005) 134 
Cal.App.4th 1332, 1346 [37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 93], suggesting that a UCL action survives the litigation privilege so long as the plaintiff 
is not a party to the earlier litigation. "
1790,6," Despite the language in Rubin quoted above discussing the broad standing principles of the UCL, that decision nowhere 
recognizes a legislative intent  [***23] within the UCL to permit enforcement actions brought by governmental entities that would 
otherwise be barred by section 47(b). To the contrary, Rubin focused on the fact that the State Bar is excepted from the litigation 
privilege in its enforcement of the antisolicitation statute. (Rubin, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 1198; see also Action Apartment, supra, 
41 Cal.4th at pp. 1246–1247.) "
1791,7," The doctrine derives from the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in Eastern R. Conf. v. Noerr Motors (1961) 365 
U.S. 127 [5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523] (Noerr), and Mine Workers v. Pennington (1965) 381 U.S. 657 [14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. 
Ct. 1585] (Pennington), and “rest[s] on statutory interpretation.” (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 321.)"
1791,8," “The right to petition for redress of grievances is [protected by both] the [California] and [United States] Constitutions. (U.S. 
Const., 1st Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 3.)”  [***27] (Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co., supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 
1133, fn. 15.) "
1793,9," Indeed, here, Pacific Lumber did in fact have success on the merits in connection with the CEQA proceedings. (See Blank, 
supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 325 [where defendants' efforts to influence governmental action were successful, they could not be 
“deemed a mere sham”].) "
1795,10," It is undisputed the CDF had in its possession several other reports contradicting the false data Pacific Lumber allegedly 
submitted regarding the Jordan Creek watershed."
1795,11," The State alleges Pacific Lumber  [***43] should have delivered the corrected data to the “designated [governmental] offices” 
rather than to the local offices of the CDF and the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. As the trial court points 
out, however, it was the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, not the “designated [governmental] offices,” that 
requested the data regarding the Jordan Creek watershed. Moreover, the State nowhere alleges that the designated office, i.e., 
the state office of the CDF, failed to receive the corrected data from its local counterpart or another source. "
1815,1," The complaints at issue in this motion are: Hy-Vee Inc., v. Visa U.S.A., et al., CV 05-3925, DE 81; Supervalu Inc. v. Visa 
U.S.A., et al., CV 05-4650,  [**26] DE 1; Raley's v. Visa U.S.A., et al., CV 05-4799, DE 1; Publix Super Markets, Inc. v. Visa 
U.S.A., et al., CV 05-4677, DE 1; The Kroger Co., et al. v. MasterCard Incorporated et al., CV 06-0039, DE 6; Rite Aid Corp., et 
al. v. MasterCard Incorporated et al., CV 06-0078, DE 1. In addition to the plaintiffs named in the cited captions, MasterCard 
seeks to dismiss the claims of plaintiffs Ahold U.S.A., Inc.; Albertson's, Inc.; Delhaize America, Inc.; Eckerd Corp.; Maxi Drug, 
Inc.; Pathmark Stores, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; and Walgreen Co. Adhering to the parties' usage in this litigation, I refer collectively to 
the plaintiffs whose claims are challenged in this motion as the ""Individual Plaintiffs"" (notwithstanding the fact that each is a 
corporate entity) to distinguish them from the ""Class Plaintiffs"" -- i.e., the named plaintiffs in the several putative class actions 
that have been consolidated in this multidistrict litigation. Each such Individual Plaintiff seeks recovery only for itself, and not on 
behalf of any putative class."
1815,2," Unless explicitly associated with a different docket number, ""DE"" refers to entries in the docket of the master file, MD 05-1720. "
1816,3," There are usually at least two such banks involved in every payment card transaction: the Issuing Bank, which issues to 
consumers payment cards bearing the imprimatur of a card association like MasterCard; and the Acquiring Bank, which receives 
payment transactions from such merchants and coordinates between and among the relevant Issuing Bank, the merchant, and 
the network  [**29] to facilitate payment. The total amount that a merchant receives as payment for a transaction in which a 
consumer uses a payment card is less than the amount that the merchant charges to the consumer; the merchant must pay 
interchange fees and other fees for the network services required to process the card transaction."
1816,4," To clarify my understanding of a somewhat opaque matter: the plaintiffs are asserting that they are prohibited from declining 
subsets of MasterCard's credit cards by force of the ""Honor All Cards""  [**31] rule, but their claim about being coerced also to 
accept MasterCard's debit cards is based on the alleged use of economic pressure rather than an explicit rule. Prior to 2004, the 
""Honor All Cards"" rule applied to all of MasterCard's payment cards, credit and debit alike. As part of the settlement of earlier 
litigation, MasterCard limited the rule so as to apply only to credit cards. See In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, 
297 F. Supp. 2d 503, 508 (E.D.N.Y. 2003). In this litigation, the plaintiffs contend in essence that the relaxation of the old rule 
has been a matter of form rather than substance: they allege that merchants who try to take advantage of the rule change by 
declining to accept debit cards or other products are charged higher fees for the cards they do accept. See Kroger Complaint P 
25(H)."
1816,5," Such rules do not forbid the merchants from passing the costs associated with accepting payments cards along to all 
consumers -- both those who use the cards and those who pay with cash -- by raising the price of their merchandise. Whether 
such merchant conduct might violate antitrust law was an issue raised in Temple v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., docket no. CV 06-
5303  [**32] (JG) (E.D.N.Y.), and Bennett, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., docket no. CV 06-5304 (JG) (E.D.N.Y.). This court 
dismissed the antitrust claims in those cases due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing, and transferred the remaining claims to 
Tennessee. See Temple, DE 75. Just as the court in Temple and Bennett did not opine on the merits of the plaintiff's substantive 
antitrust theory, I likewise express no view on the issue here. "
1817,6," The instant motion was briefed and argued before Twombly was decided. No party has suggested in its briefing that either the 
latter decision or the cases in this Circuit interpreting it such as Iqbal and In re Elevator Antitrust Litigation alter the analysis or 
the outcome that should obtain here. I note that in their oral arguments, the parties did make reference to a plausibility standard 
drawn from pre-existing case law in this circuit. See DE 738 (Transcript of Proceedings dated November 21, 2006) (""Tr."") 82 
(MasterCard's argument that the Individual Plaintiffs ""have to make more than a conclusory allegation about [monopoly power]""); 
Tr. 87 (""They have no factual allegations to support the plausibility that MasterCard credit cards [or] network services are not 
interchangeable or deemed interchangeable with Visa or American Express or other[s.]""); Tr. 101 (Individual Plaintiffs' argument 
that they ""have plausibly pled that it is because of the narrow market and … the extraordinary circumstances  [**36] that cause 
that market to have its boundaries and its definition and … that they have been charged in the declining cost structure.""). In light 
of the record and the state of the law prior to Twombley, I have not solicited additional argument addressing recent case law 
developments. "
1819,7," Moreover, the Discover decision does not specify whether the plaintiffs' allegations in that case failed because they rested only 
on MasterCard's market share in lieu of any direct evidence or for some other reason. Without a clearer statement on that score, 
its persuasive weight is limited. "
1822,8," To the extent that MasterCard relies on the fact that it has previously been found to compete in a market that includes not only 
other brands of credit cards, but also charge cards, see Memo. at 9 (citing United States v. Visa, 344 F.3d 229, 238-39 (2d Cir. 
2003)), its reliance is misplaced. The court in Visa so defined the market only on the basis of ""substantial expert testimony"" and 
other evidence produced in discovery; it did not reject a single-brand market theory at the pleading stage. It may be that 
MasterCard will succeed in defeating the Single-Market Brand theory by means of  [**58] a motion for summary judgment for the "
1823,," same reason that the court defined an all-payment-card market in Visa, but that possibility provides no basis for dismissing that 
part of the Individual Plaintiffs' claims now. "
1827,1," Erickson did agree that Sikorsky would continue to manufacture the main and tail rotor blades, under a license from Erickson. "
1828,2," In a lease agreement, a tenant may expressly promise not to permit the premises to be used for violation of narcotics laws. 
 [*9] It is unlikely such promise would be deemed to implicitly negate the tenant's duty to comply with other applicable laws, or to 
preclude the landlord from evicting the tenant for operating a brothel in the apartment. Similarly, Erickson's express 
acknowledgment of its obligation to comply with certain federal regulations does not implicitly negate other duties created by the 
contract."
1828,3," HTS argues that when a program is abandoned, ""the FAA takes charge of the data for the aircraft and makes it available to 
other operators for the continued operational safety  [*11] of the aircraft,"" yet Erickson allegedly has not provided to the FAA a 
notice of abandonment or the required technical data. HTS Reply, p. 6."
1828,4," A Connecticut trial court has expressed the view that a third party beneficiary may not enforce the implied covenant of good fair 
and fair dealing. See Beck v. New Samaritan Family Housing of Waterbury, Inc., 2005 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1540, 2005 WL 
1670810 (Conn. Super. 2005) (but acknowledging no appellate court in Connecticut has ruled on this question). It seems 
peculiar to hold that a contracting party must act in good faith regarding the other contracting party, yet may act in bad faith 
toward a third party beneficiary to whom the parties intended to create a direct obligation, depriving that person of the benefits 
the contract was to confer. I do not believe the Connecticut Supreme Court would adopt such a rule, and respectfully decline to 
follow Beck on this point. See Fiorito Bros., Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., 747 F.2d 1309, 1314 (9th Cir. 1984)  [*12] (federal court must 
attempt to predict how state's highest court would decide question of state law). "
1829,5," The FAA regulations at issue here concern aircraft parts. I have no occasion to consider the applicability of antitrust law to any 
other aviation issue. Cf. Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 387, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 
(""Federal Aviation Act does not completely displace the antitrust laws"" but the particular claims in that action were preempted)."
1829,6," In Harrison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar Int'l, Inc., 316 F. Supp. 2d 186 (E.D. Pa. 2004), the court framed the inquiry as whether the 
FAA had ""specifically considered the potential alleged anticompetitive consequences"" of the agency's action. Id. at 210. The 
defendant was arguing that immunity from antitrust laws was conferred by the FAA's approval of the manufacturer's Instructions 
for Continued Airworthiness, which included language implying customers must use fabric purchased from a particular source. 
The present case does not concern FAA approval of a user manual. "
1830,7," HTS has been less-than-consistent in defining whether the relevant market includes only helicopters with a lift capacity of at 
least 25,000 pounds, or if 20,000 pound capacity helicopters also are included, and whether the relevant geographic market is 
just the United States or the entire world. At some time, preferably before we instruct the jury, HTS must settle on a proposed 
market definition. "
1831,8," The FAA has cautioned that ""[t]he reverse engineering process uses techniques that vary widely and produce diverse results[,]"" 
and that ""reverse engineering a part will not normally produce a design that is identical to a type-certificated part."" FAA Order 
8110.42B, Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures (Sept. 9, 2005), §§ 2-6 (c), 3-8 (a). "
1832,9," The prohibitions of § 21.303 do not apply to parts produced under a type certificate, or by an owner or operator for maintaining 
or altering his own product. § 21.303(b)(1) and (b)(2). HTS holds the type certificate for its own CH-54s. The present briefing is "
1833,," insufficient to determine whether § 21.303(b)(1) and (2) permit HTS to contract with Erickson to produce parts for HTS, or 
whether the operator must actually make the parts itself. HTS also contends that Erickson may sell parts to HTS on an ""as-is"" basis. Again, the current briefing is not sufficiently 
developed to decide that question."
1833,10," Erickson cites Covad Communications Co. v. BellSouth Corp., 374 F.3d 1044, 1049 (11th Cir. 2004), for the proposition that 
""Trinko now effectively makes the unilateral termination of a voluntary course of dealing a requirement for a valid refusal-to-deal 
claim under Aspen."" Trinko said no such thing. I respectfully  [*29] decline to adopt the view of the Eleventh Circuit on that point. "
1839,1," There is some question regarding whether the compounds were purchased directly by CT or instead by ESP, which then may 
have ordered that the compounds be shipped directly to CT. (Def.'s Reply at 2.) The answer to this question is immaterial to the 
disposition of this action."
1839,2," The parties apparently dispute whether Wacker was approached about reformulating the compound before CT began 
producing it internally. Compare Bowers Aff. P 9 with Def.'s Br. Summ. J. at  [**6] 6. Bowers admits that CT in fact produces 
compounds internally. (Bowers Aff. P 10.) It makes no difference why the decision to do so was made. "
1842,3," Bowers flippantly asserts that the Noncompetition Agreement constitutes an ""illegal restraint of trade"" and is therefore void and 
unenforceable. By using this phrase, Bowers appears to be invoking the Sherman Act, which provides that HN16[
] ""[e]very 
contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, 
or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Suffice to say that this is not an antitrust case, and 
Bowers makes no effort either to allege a violation of antitrust law in his complaint or to prove one in his motion for summary 
judgment. To the extent Bowers contends the Noncompetition Agreement is an illegal contract in restraint of trade, he is 
mistaken. "
1843,4," The Court's decision not to rule on this issue is further informed by the statement in Wacker's reply that ""if ESP was unhappy 
with Wacker['s product], it was free to obtain compounds from some party other than Wacker."" (Def.'s  [**20] Reply 3.) It 
therefore appears that there may be a simple solution to this problem that both parties can live with and that would not require 
judicial intervention. Based on this statement, and the other facts regarding CT's business, it appears that Wacker would have 
no problem if CT's customer for the silicone rubber sponge sheet with tape, ESP, purchased the silicone compound input 
materials from a third-party and had the materials shipped to CT, which would then extrude the materials into the finished 
product and sell it to ESP. In fact, it appears that this is precisely the arrangement the parties used back when CT's purchased 
the compound from Wacker and used it to make products for sale to ESP. Apparently, ESP made the purchase from Wacker 
and paid Wacker directly, but ordered the compound shipped by Wacker directly to CT. (See Ullom Aff. P 5.) The Court notes 
that only Bowers and CT are bound by the Noncompetition Agreement, not ESP or any third-party producer. The parties are 
encouraged to reach an agreeable business resolution of this issue. "
1846,1," AB-rated generic versions of brand name drugs contain the same active ingredient because they are determined to be 
""bioequivalent"" to the brand name drug counterparts, providing the same amount of active ingredient in a patient's bloodstream 
for the same amount of time. Compl. P 3. AB-rated generics enable direct purchasers to purchase generic versions of brand 
name drugs at substantially lower prices without seeking or obtaining permission from the prescribing doctor, unless the 
prescription is denominated ""Dispense as Written""). See Compl. PP 33-34 "
1849,2," The FDA letter states in relevant part: Your argument seems to be based on a false premise, namely, that if a particular generic manufacturer recommends in 
leflunomide labeling a loading dose of 100 mg  [*15] for three days (3 x 100 mg), the manufacturer either must (1) provide 
its own 100-mg product or (2) recommend using five of its 20-mg tablets. You incorrectly speculate that generic sponsors 
will attempt to either replace the 100-mg tablet loading dose from the label . . . . [Y]ou argue that replacing the 100-mg 
loading dose with a loading dose of five 20-mg tablets should require an in vivo bioequivalence study, and that it is legally 
and medically inappropriate to remove mention of the loading dose from the label. You seem to ignore a third possibility: 
that the labeling for a generic leflunomide product can recommend a loading dose of 3 x 100 mg that can be accomplished 
by the use of an approved 100-mg tablet from a different manufacturer. . . . As does the approved labeling for Arava . . ., approved labeling for generic leflunomide products would include the 
recommendation of using 100-mg tablets for the loading dose. . . . As reflected by existing precedents, ANDA sponsors 
may refer in their labeling to products they do not manufacture. . . . It is also not uncommon for brand name products to 
refer in their labeling to other drugs that are not provided by the sponsor of the brand  [*16] name product (e.g., the labeling 
of Oncaspar, an Aventis product, recommends its use in combination with . . . products not made by Aventis . . . ). Additionally, there is nothing in the Act or the regulations that requires an ANDA applicant to seek approval for all available 
strengths of the [reference listed drug]. . . . [Y]our concern that (1) this labeling will be omitted for generic leflunomide products that are approved at only 10-mg and 
20-mg strengths, or (2) the labeling will be changed to recommend the use of five 20-mg tablets instead of a 100-mg tablet 
absent appropriate bioequivalence data, is unfounded. Compl. Exh. 1, at 6-7. "
1858,1," Section 330 of the Bankruptcy Code  [*11] is not applicable to this issue. I have consistently held that section 330 does not 
include a ""forum rule,"" but that issue is not before me."
1858,2," Although the Hawaii Supreme Court has not specifically adopted Gates' holding regarding outside-forum rates and Hawaii 
courts have recognized the general rule that a ""reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar  [*12] work,"" 
Reiche v. Ferrera, 2003 Haw. App. LEXIS 7, 2003 WL 139608, at * 8 (Haw.App. Jan. 16, 2003), I conclude that the Hawaii 
Supreme Court would recognize this exception to the ""forum rule.""HN10[
]  Hawaii courts have looked to Ninth Circuit 
decisions in determining the factors to be considered in arriving at a reasonable attorney's fee. See, e.g., Reiche, 2003 Haw. 
App. LEXIS 7, 2003 WL 139608, at * 9 (""The factors adopted by Hawai'i courts [in computing a reasonable fee] are similar to the 
Kerr factors adopted by the Ninth Circuit [in Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir. 1975)] in federal subject 
matter jurisdiction cases.""). Moreover, the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii has observed in the context of section 607-
14, citing Gates, that ""[t]he court may apply rates from outside the forum if local counsel is unavailable, either because they are 
unwilling to take the case or because they lack the level of experience and expertise to do so."" See Kotoshirodo v. Cart, Inc., 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66869, 2006 WL 2682676, at * 5 (D. Haw. Sept. 18, 2006). "
1859,3," Mesa notes that the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii capped its recovery of attorneys' fees at the prevailing 
maximum hourly rate in Hawaii ($ 275) in a separate action against it by Aloha Airlines, Inc. (""Aloha""). Aloha Airlines, Inc. v. 
Mesa Air Group, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58852, 2007 WL 2320672 (D. Haw. Aug. 10, 2007). In that case, Mesa sought to 
recover, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(d), the fees and costs it incurred in a short-lived state court action that Aloha voluntarily 
dismissed before filing a substantially similar action in federal court. The District Court's limitation of fees in Aloha does not 
compel the same result in this case. Mesa made no argument in its moving papers in Aloha that the Gates exception to the 
""forum rule"" should apply. The district court accordingly applied the general rule that a reasonable fee is determined 
 [*15] according to the prevailing market rate in Hawaii. In contrast, HA has made a thorough showing in this case of the 
unavailability of uniquely qualified local counsel. Mesa has also offered no reason to reduce the fee award to HA's local counsel, 
the Carlsmith firm. Carlsmith has provided evidence of its normal rates and that HA has in fact paid those rates. Mesa has 
offered no contrary argument or evidence. "

The Melrose Improv Club is located in Los Angeles, California."

1881,8," Section 1 of the Trademark Agreement stated, in relevant part, that ""'a Person' is ""any natural person, or any corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, business association, trust . . . or other entity,"" and that the term ""Affiliate"" 
means and includes ""any members of such Person's immediate family, or the member of the immediate family of any 
 [**8] direct or indirect shareholder of such Person. . . . Further, the members of the immediate family of any Person shall include 
all collateral relatives of such Person having a common linear ancestor with such Person, and the spouse or any former spouse 
of such Person or any of such collateral relatives of such spouse."""
1881,9," Although all the issues in this appeal concern the arbitrator's decision in the Partial Final Arbitration Award entered on February 
28, 2005, the arbitrator issued a second arbitral award, the Final Arbitration Award, which was decided on May 20, 2005. The 
district court confirmed that award on June 21, 2005, and entered judgment on August 29, 2005. CCI timely appealed the district 
court's order confirming the Final Arbitration Award on July 20, 2005, but raised no issues on appeal concerning that award. We 
consolidated the two cases for appeal purposes. "

1884,11," CCI raises this issue for the first time on appeal. HN8[
] Although we generally do ""not consider an issue raised for the first 
time on appeal,"" we recognize three exceptions to that rule, by which we may invoke our discretion and review the issue: (1) 
where ""review is necessary to prevent a miscarriage  [**18] of justice or to preserve the integrity of the judicial process""; (2) 
where there is a change in the law creating a new issue; or (3) ""when the issue presented is purely one of law and either does 
not depend on the factual record developed below, or the pertinent record has been fully developed."" Cold Mountain v. Garber, 
375 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, we exercise our discretion and review 
CCI's argument under exceptions one and three. "
1885,12," The general rule is that if the breach is a material breach, it may give grounds for the non-breaching party to cancel the 
contract, see Rano v. Sipa Press, Inc., 987 F.2d 580, 586 (9th Cir. 1993), but if the breach is a partial breach, the non-breaching "

1886,14," Because Improv West revoked CCI's rights to the Improv marks for almost the entire contiguous United States, the Improv 
West-CCI licensing relationship has ended except as to the existing Improv clubs. Bearing this in mind, it might be possible to 
view § 9.j., with respect to the majority of the United States, functionally as if it were a post-term covenant not to compete, and 
with respect to the Improv clubs that CCI continues to operate, as an in-term covenant not to compete. However, because the 
contract relationship has not been canceled, and continues for the existing Improv clubs operated by CCI, we think it more "
1887,," appropriate conceptually to analyze § 9.j. nationwide as an in-term covenant not to compete, while considering CCI's limited 
continuing use of the Improv marks as pertinent to the scope of § 9.j."
1887,15," Similar to Dayton Time Lock, the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Great Frame Up Systems, Inc. v. Jazayeri 
Enterprises, 789 F. Supp. 253 (N. D. Ill. 1992), stated, while interpreting California law on CBPC § 16600, that California courts 
support the position ""that preventing defendants from competing only during the term of [an] existing franchise agreement, would 
not be void.""Id. at 255. The court reasoned, however, that the in-term contractual provisions still cannot prevent a party from 
engaging in an entire profession, business or trade. See id. at 256. Finally, in General Commercial Packaging, Inc. v. TPS Package Engineering, Inc., 126 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 1997) (per curiam), 
we addressed  [**31] a covenant not to compete in a general contractor-subcontractor context. General Commercial Packaging 
(""GCP""), a packing and crating service, subcontracted with TPS for TPS to provide packing and crating services for Walt Disney 
Company, one of GCP's major customers. Id. at 1132. TPS and GCP signed an in-term and post-term covenant not to compete, 
which provided that TPS would not work directly for, or solicit business from, Disney or any other company GCP introduced to 
TPS. Id. Although from the opinion it is unclear whether TPS and GCP's business relationship dissolved, we nonetheless upheld 
the covenant not to compete because it only limited the sub-contractor's ""access to a narrow segment of the packing and 
shipping market."" Id. at 1134. Because the covenant not to compete left a substantial portion of the packing and shipping market 
open to TPS, we held that the covenant not to compete was enforceable. Id."
1887,16," The covenant not to compete provided that Kelton agreed not to operate any warehouses and Stravinski agreed not to design 
or build any warehouses. Kelton, 138 Cal. App. 4th at 945. "
1888,17," First, the arbitrator reasoned that Dayton Time Lock was inapplicable because it involved an assessment of antitrust laws. 
However, Dayton Time Lock made clear that it was assessing the requirements of CBPC § 16600, and its plain language 
applied standards from antitrust cases in aid of its application of  [**36] § 16600. Second, the arbitrator thought § 16600 was 
inapplicable because California in the Cartwright Act had a separate antitrust statute distinct from § 16600, but the arbitrator's 
notice of the Cartwright Act does not detract from what Dayton Time Lock held in assessing an issue under § 16600, which 
Dayton Time Lock itself characterized as a state antitrust law. Both § 16600 and the Cartwright Act deal with antitrust and 
competition policy and it was not in the province of the arbitrator to make a ""ruling"" about § 16600 that was so at odds with what 
the California Court of Appeal stated in Dayton Time Lock. "
1889,18," Improv West contends, without opposition from CCI, that the arbitration section in the Trademark Agreement entitles it to 
attorneys' fees and costs associated with this appeal and the confirmation proceedings of the arbitration awards. The arbitration 
agreement does award ""costs, including reasonable attorneys fees"" to ""[t]he prevailing party."" And we have upheld such an 
award for a party who successfully confirmed an arbitration award. See  [**39] A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v. McCollough, 967 
F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (ordering the arbitration award confirmed, and awarding the prevailing party 
""attorneys' fees in accordance with the agreements between the parties""). However, in this case Improv West partially confirmed 
the arbitrator's award, but we have modified the scope of that award. We hold that Improv West is entitled to costs and fees only 
with regard to its work on the issues on which it prevailed. We remand the issue of costs and attorneys' fees to the district court 
to determine the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs that should be awarded to Improv West insofar as it prevailed. "
