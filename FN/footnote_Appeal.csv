47,"In that report, at page 10, the following statement appears: ""The commission desires to call particular attention to its solution of  a problem which arose in preparing the codification of the Cartwright Anti-Trust Act (Chapter 530, Statutes of 1907, as  amended). In 1909 (Chapter 362) the act was amended, among other things, to provide certain exemptions in Section 1. ""The Federal District Court for the Southern District of California has held that these exemptions, added to the California Act in  1909, are unconstitutional and not separable and that, therefore, the entire California act is invalid. (  Blake vs. Paramount  Pictures, Inc., (1938) 22 F. Supp. 249 ). This decision relies on the United States Supreme Court decision which held  unconstitutional a Colorado antitrust statute, containing exemptions substantially identical to those added to Section 1 of the  California act in 1909, on the ground that these exemptions, a part of the Colorado statute as originally enacted, made the  required standard of conduct too uncertain for a penal statute. (  Cline vs. Frink Dairy Co. (1927) 274 U.S. 445, 71 L. Ed. 1146,  47 S. Ct. 681 ). ""The Attorney General of California is of the opinion that this 1909 amendment was invalid in view of the holding in Cline vs.  Frink Dairy Co., never became a part of the 1907 act, hence that Section 1 of the Cartwright Act in the form in which originally  enacted is valid and operative. (Opinion NS 2806, July 29, 1940.)",
48,"""In the absence of a decision by the California Supreme Court, the commission has prepared a codification of the entire  California act, as amended. As thus codified, without substantial change, it will, of course, have neither greater nor less validity,  operation or effect than prior to codification. (  Business and Professions Code, Sec. 2 :  San Joaquin etc. Irr. Co. vs. Stevinson,  164 Cal. 221, at 233, 128 P. 924  and 234;  Sobey vs. Molony, 40 Cal. App. 2d 381, 104 P.2d 868 .) However, as a special  precaution, the commission has inserted a specific saving clause (Section 16701) which is specially designed to leave as it is the  question of separability, so that the 1907 Cartwright Act, and the 1909 amendments thereto, will manifestly have no greater (and  no less) validity, operation, or effect than if they had not been codified.""",

82,"Opinion The trial court's memorandum provides in part as follows: ""III ""The first subject to which I address my attention is chosen for priority in order not because it has basic significance, although it  has, but only because it can, I think, be disposed of most easily. ""I recognize the fiduciary relationship that exists between an employee and his employer.  No conversation between the parties,  specifically dwelling upon the subject, was necessary to establish that relationship and the incident duties, they being created  and defined by the law.  Section 2322 of our Civil Code, being part of an article on the 'authority of agents,' states that '[an]  authority expressed in general terms, however broad, does not authorize an agent: . . . 3 To do any act which a trustee is  forbidden to do by article two, chapter one, of the last title.' This provision directs us back to the cleanly cut statutory delineation  of the 'Obligations of Trustees' found in sections 2228-2239 of the same code. ""These statutes are supplemented by the Labor Code, wherein, in  section 2856 , the Legislature has decreed as follows: HN1 [ ] ""'  Â§ 2856 .  [ Compliance with employer's directions .] An employee shall substantially comply with all the directions of his  employer concerning the service on which he is engaged, except where such obedience is impossible or unlawful, or would  impose new and unreasonable burdens upon the employee.' ""'  Â§ 2859 .  [ Use of skill possessed .] An employee is always bound to use such skill as he possesses, so far as the same is  required, for the service specified.' ""'  Â§ 2860 .   Ownership of things acquired by virtue of employment .  Everything which an employee acquires by virtue of his  employment, except the compensation which is due to him from his employer, belongs to the employer, whether acquired  lawfully or unlawfully, or during or after the expiration of the term of his employment.'",
83,"""As pointed out in  Burns v. Clark, 133 Cal. 634 [66 P. 12, 85 Am. St. Rep. 233] , a key phrase in  section 2860  is the phrase 'by  virtue of his employment.' ""A statement of the law on this subject, law which is really quite elementary, appears in 2 California Jurisprudence 2d at pages  769-774; and having satisfied myself of the fairness and reliability of the statement, I have no hesitancy in citing it as a short-cut  to an abundance of precedent. ""In relation to all the foregoing, however, we must have in mind that the relationship and duties of an employee to his employer  are one matter, and the duty, if any, of an ex-employee to an ex-employer is quite another. HN2 [ ] ""Whether any duty or interdiction, other than the general duties that rest upon us all, hangs over the ex-employee  depends on the existence or nonexistence of either or both of two possibilities: (1) a contract yet in force in one or more  respects, and to be performed, or a new contract, or (2) an item of private property, which may be a product of the mind,  belonging to the ex-employer, in respect to which the ex-employee still carries a trust responsibility, or the ownership of which,  as of any other private property, commands by law the respect of, and forbids the invasion, trespass or conversion by, others  than the owner.  . . . ""IV "". . . I refer to the proposition [i.e., urged by plaintiff's counsel] that by virtue of  section 1962, subdivision 2 , of the Code of Civil  Procedure, the defendant Koutnik is forever bound by recitals contained in the verification of the patent application, Plaintiff's  Exhibit 35, and is now estopped to deny the originality, as of the date of that application, of the inventions and the claims in  respect thereto stated in the application. ""The pertinent part of  section 1962, Code of Civil Procedure , reads as follows: ""'  Â§ 1962 .  [ Presumptions; conclusive ].  Specification of Conclusive Presumptions.  The following presumptions, and no others,  are deemed conclusive: ""'. . . . HN3 [ ] ""'2. The truth of the facts recited, from the recital in a written instrument between the parties thereto, or their successors  in interest by a subsequent title; but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration;' ""In the verification to the patent application, Koutnik and Piet made these statements among others not pertinent here: ""'. . . that we have read the foregoing specification and claims and we verily believe we are the original, first and joint inventors of  the invention or discovery in High Pressure Valve Mechanism described and claimed therein; that we do not know and do not  believe that this invention was ever known or used before our invention or discovery thereof, or patented or described in any  printed publication in any country before our invention or discovery thereof, or more than one year prior to this application . . .' ""It seems clear to me that the intended effect of  Code of Civil Procedure, section 1962 ,  subdivision 2 , is a limited effect, and that  the presumption applies conclusively only when it is relevant to a controversy that questions 'the obligations or liabilities of the  contracting parties' or 'their successors in interest' under the 'written instrument' in which the recitals appeared.  I say frankly that  I know of no California case stating explicitly what I just have said, but a like view, I believe, is implied or insinuated in:  ""  Gas Appliance Sales Co., Inc. v. W. B. Bastian Manufacturing Co., 87 Cal.App. 301, 306 [262 P. 452] ; ""  Taylor v. Lundblade, 43 Cal.App.2d 638, 640 [111 P.2d 344] ; ""  Rhine v. Ellen, 36 Cal. 362 .",
84,"""The instant action involves no question concerning the liabilities or obligations of the parties under and/or by virtue of the patent  application, Exhibit 35, the verification thereof or the assignment to Futurecraft Corporation, and this action is not in any of its  causes founded on or claimed to derive from any of or all such instruments. "". . . . ""Exhibit 35 is, of course, in evidence, and I would say rather conspicuously so.  I do not deny or question its place in evidence for  all pertinent and reasonable purposes and inferences, not all of which are favorable to plaintiff, but I do . . . refuse to set up a  conclusive  presumption or an estoppel against other relevant evidence, as requested and urged by the plaintiff.  [Emphasis  shown.] ""V "". . . a theme that has been intoned by plaintiff throughout this litigation . . . [is] that the one all-important, basic and critical  question in this case, and in any similar case, is whether or not the employee, while in the confidential relationship of servant to  his master, received ideas or knowledge from his employer, or through his employment, which, since the end of the employment,  he has used to his own advantage and/or to the injury of the former employer. ""This theory . . . has been encouraged by the much quoted detached words of Mr. Justice Holmes in  E. I. Du Pont De Nemours  Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 U.S. 100, 102 [37 S.Ct. 575, 61 L.Ed. 1016] , quoted on page 16 of plaintiff's trial brief: ""'Whether the plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not, the defendant knows the facts, whatever they are, through a special  confidence that he accepted.  The property may be denied, but the confidence cannot be.' ""We find a similarly isolated statement on page 4 of plaintiff's trial brief, taken from  Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp. v. Cox,  50 N.Y.S.2d 643, 657  . . .: ""'Concededly, the field [of prior art] was not entirely virgin.  But the plaintiffs' expenditures [ sic ] of time and money brought results  not reached by others.  Once we conclude that the work done under Cox's supervision was confidential, and that Cox threatens  to breach the confidence, all else is of subordinate importance.' ""The most clarifying way to deal with this theory that confidence is paramount and all else is subordinate is, I believe, by  reductio  ad absurdum .  . . . "". . . . HN4 [ ] ""Manifestly and necessarily, when we confront the claimed existence of a trade secret, and a claim that it has been  misappropriated, trespassed upon or wrongly converted, we are commanded to an injury that is just as vital as that which looks  for a confidential relationship, namely, an inquiry into the existence or nonexistence of the element of private property. "". . . . ""California by numerous judicial decisions and by statute long has recognized private property in products of the mind.   Examples of the recognition are the following: "" Civil Code, section 980, subdivision (b) : ""'The inventor or proprietor of any invention or design, with or without delineation, or other graphical representation, has an  exclusive ownership therein, and in the representation or expression thereof, which continues so long as the invention or design  and the representations or expressions thereof made by him remain in his possession.' "" Civil Code, section 983, subdivision (b) : ""'If the owner of any invention or design intentionally makes it public, a copy or reproduction may be made public by any person,  without responsibility to the owner, so far as the law of this State is concerned.' "" Civil Code, section 984 : ""'If the owner of an invention or design does not make it public, any other person subsequently and originally producing the  same thing has the same right therein as the prior inventor, which is exclusive to the same extent against all persons except the  prior inventor, or those claiming under him.'",
85,"""Hence we are not engaged in mere psychic phenomena or pure speculation or the pursuit of mystery when we inquire whether  Mr. Koutnik, when he left the employ of plaintiff, carried with him any knowledge or ideas which then were and still are the  private property of the plaintiff. ""VI "". . . at least certain of the so-called trade secrets claimed by plaintiff are now, and long have been, in the public domain, or if in  any instance, the private property of anyone, then the property of someone other than plaintiff. ""In its courageous effort to efface competition from the defendants by the theory of being exclusive owner of certain trade  secrets, plaintiff has confronted three distinct and formidable factual barriers: (1)  Its own sales of its valves in the market that  exists for such products, and its sales and promotional efforts and methods, including public displays (meaning, in this case, of  course, displays for that part of the public interested in such products ).  [Emphasis added.] (2) The prior art, the previously  known, published and utilized ideas, principles, devices and methods in valve manufacture. (3) The filing by plaintiff of an  application for patent, Plaintiff's Exhibit 35, and the incidental necessary disclosure to the public of all those ideas and features  claimed to be secret. ""Although our California statutes defining property rights in products of the mind ( Civ. Code, Â§Â§ 980- 985 ) are not expressly  related to the subject of trade secrets, they must be respected as expressions of California's legislative theory, policy and  decision.   Civil Code, section 983, subdivision (b) , not only specifically states a significant principle, but it is freighted with  connotations not to be ignored.  It says: HN5 [ ] ""'If the owner of any invention or design intentionally makes it public, a copy or reproduction may be made public by any  person, without responsibility to the owner, so far as the law of this State is concerned.' ""The fact that the structure or configuration of a valve is not obvious to external observation or examination is of no significance  in a market such as we deal with here.  We cannot know the recipe for a jar of jam, either, just from looking at it.  As the  evidence conclusively has proved, it is no 'trick,' but only a matter of some labor and time, for an engineer or a machinist to cut  open a valve and see in bare display all the details of its configuration.  Every time a valve was sold, all the 'secrets' in its design  were transmitted to the purchaser, who then was empowered to transmit them to others as he wished or willed .  [Emphasis  added.] ""Counsel for defendants have laid a good deal of stress upon the fact -- and it is a fact -- that plaintiff made numerous sales of its  valves without imposing or attempting to impose any restriction upon the purchaser as to the use to which the valves might be  put or the disposition the purchaser might make of them.  It is evident to me that I do not attach so much importance to so-called  proprietary notices and notices of restrictive use as counsel for defendants possibly do, and as counsel for plaintiff certainly do. ""I recognize, of course, that as between A, a manufacturer and prospective seller, and B, a prospective or actual buyer, any kind  of a lawful agreement they wish to, and do, make will be binding upon them . . . But the effect of this private agreement upon  others not privy to it, upon the public, and upon a secret or so-called secret, is quite a different matter . . . And I am not  convinced that in the commercial world one can preserve a trade secret by the simple device of telling all to whom he reveals it  that he claims it to be a secret and his private property. ""I agree with Mr. Lyon that  HN6 [ ] the patent laws of the United States delimit the only legitimate way by which one can  establish a monopoly in the commercial utilization of an original mechanical idea.  Were we judicially to authorize the creation of  a monopoly by the simple and easy method of attaching 'proprietary' and restrictive notices to products and to the drawings,  sales literature, invoices, bills of sale and other papers used in selling and trying to sell them, we would circumvent the patent  law and negate the antitrust laws, two chapters of jurisprudence firmly embedded in the public policy of our commonwealth. ""VII ""Facing the prior art in the field of valve manufacture, plaintiff is in the unenviable position of being required to depose or  disparage, if he is to surmount the revelation of the evidence, the very doctrine that he must mightily uphold to obtain the relief  he seeks or any valuable relief.  I refer to the doctrine of equivalence. Plaintiff's own expert witness, Mr. Gregg, utilized and  expounded the doctrine.  And defendants' expert witness, Mr. Doble, made equally sincere and effective use of the doctrine in  displaying the prior art.",
86,"""I do not mean to imply that the doctrine of equivalence is needed to give relevant meaning to every fact and record produced at  the trial from the storehouse of knowledge relative to valve manufacture. Indeed, in many details no translation or interpretation  through functional analogy is required. ""But the doctrine of equivalence is vital to plaintiff's case.  It might be called the heart of plaintiff's cause of action, if plaintiff has  any cause of action. ""The pleadings and statements of counsel and certain of the evidence have made clear to the court that  plaintiff does not  contend that either defendant has produced, or threatens to produce, a valve having the exact configuration of any of plaintiff's  valves. It is equally clear that plaintiff does not seek injunctive relief which merely would restrain defendants from producing a  valve exactly like any of plaintiff's valves. Not only does plaintiff pray for an injunction that would make full play of the doctrine of  equivalence, but anything less would be of no value to it .  [Emphasis added.] ""If we were to ask a dozen learned and skillful valve engineers each to work independently of the other, each to avail himself of  all accumulated and recorded knowledge of the valve art, and each to design a valve to accomplish a specific function, the  probability is that no two of them would produce precisely the same configuration. The point is, as plaintiff well knows and as its  pleadings, prayer, evidence and argument all indicate, a valve manufacturer has no advantage over his competitor simply in  having a unique configuration, a unique way in which he arranges and uses the commonly held or available knowledge, ideas  and mechanical principles relating to the art. ""The court has no choice but to recognize and respect the full significance of the doctrine of equivalence, and doing so, it finds in  the prior art, not necessarily alone, but certainly in conjunction with other relevant factors, formidable opposition to plaintiff's  claim of private property in the ideas which it seeks to have defendants enjoined from using. ""VIII HN7 [ ] ""After a person has applied for a patent from the United States Government and has complied with the law pertaining to  the public disclosure of his ideas, he is hardly in a position thereafter to claim that any of the ideas so disclosed is a trade secret.  If he establishes a claim of invention, he, of course, will have a right of private property as evidenced by, and to the extent  granted in, the patent. Thereupon his rights of monopoly will be controlled by the patent laws, not by any equitable or legal  principles applicable to the misuse of trade secrets. ""As stated in  Speaker v. Shaler Co., 87 F.2d 985 , (Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit; certiorari denied,  301 U.S. 695 [57  S.Ct. 923, 81 L.Ed. 1350] ) concerning the filing of an application for patent: ""'The contents thereof were disclosed to the world by filing it [the application] in the patent office.  Nothing therein could have  remained confidential or secret.' "". . . . ""IX ""Uncontradicted evidence establishes the fact that when Rodrick [ sic ] Koutnik entered the employ of plaintiff, he carried with him  a good deal of knowledge concerning the art, science and mechanics of valve design and manufacture, and a good deal of skill  in the application of that knowledge.  We, of course, cannot know precisely what ideas, theories and facts then were lodged in  his own brain. ""Much, probably most, of that knowledge had been acquired at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of  Technology, where many young engineers have received not only a theoretical, but an extraordinarily practical, 'post-graduate  course.' It is reasonable to conclude that the learning there imbibed by Koutnik was supplemented by his own independent  studies and thinking and possibly by contacts and association with engineers from other institutions. ""It would be impossible for me, as I am sure it would for any counsel in the case, to draw a boundary line between the  knowledge carried by Koutnik into his employment by plaintiff and any additional knowledge or ideas he may have acquired by  virtue of that employment.  Indeed, no such boundary line exists, for as new knowledge is acquired it integrates itself with the  old.  We deal here with a sum total of ideas, theories, facts, principles and skills that we know not how to divide, assuming that a  part is attributable to Koutnik's employment by plaintiff. "" To grant plaintiff the relief requested, or any remedy that would be of value to it, would necessitate enjoining Koutnik from the  use of knowledge, a good deal of which certainly is his own or belongs to the public domain, gained by him through his own",
87,"industry and intellectual faculties, independently of any association with plaintiff, and inextricably interlaced with any knowledge  he may have acquired through his employment by plaintiff .  [Emphasis added.] HN8 [ ] ""To prevent or to attempt to prevent a person from using his own learning and skill, in respect to which he is under no  duty of restraint by virtue of a trust or confidence, would be so plainly an injustice and a social and economic folly, that when we  have an actual or possible integration of such knowledge with knowledge or ideas encumbered by a prohibition because of their  genesis in confidence, the plaintiff seeking prohibitory judgment must carry the burden of identifying and isolating the particular  products of the mind in which he claims to have a right of private property. ""X ""For reasons indicated, I conclude that plaintiff is not entitled to take anything by this action. "". . . ."" The findings of fact and conclusions of law are in pertinent part as follows: ""Findings of Fact ""1. At no time during the course of his employment by Futurecraft did Koutnik in any way violate the fiduciary relationship which  existed between him and Futurecraft because of such employment nor did he do any act which a trustee is forbidden to do under  the laws of this state. ""2. When Koutnik reentered the employ of Futurecraft on or about January 31, 1953, said date being not less than five months  prior to the development or designing, or the alleged conception or invention, by Futurecraft of any of the valves or valve  components referred to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, Koutnik brought with him  much, if not most, of the knowledge and skill concerning the art, science and mechanics of valve design and manufacture which  he utilized in designing and developing, or participating in the design or development of, the valves or valve components referred  to in Paragraphs V, VI and VII of the first cause of action of the complaint, or which he utilized in designing or developing, or  participating in the design or development of, certain progenitors of the valve referred to in Paragraph IX of said cause of action.  If Koutnik acquired any part of said knowledge or skill by virtue of his employment by Futurecraft, then plaintiff has not sustained  the burden of identifying or isolating that part of said knowledge or skill so acquired.  In this connection, during the course of his  employment by Futurecraft Koutnik had no knowledge of the design or internal arrangement of the parts of, or the materials used  in, the valve referred to in Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, and all of the allegations contained in the  third sentence of Paragraph IX of said cause of action are untrue. ""3. None of the matters or things allegedly confidential to Futurecraft, as set forth in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first  cause of action of the complaint and in Answers 4, 8, 34, 57, 104 and 108 of Futurecraft's answers to Clary's interrogatories, is  or ever was owned by, or confidential to, or the private property or a trade secret of, Futurecraft.  In this connection all of the  allegations contained in the third sentence of Paragraph V and in the fourth sentence of Paragraph VI, of Paragraph VII, and of  Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint are untrue. ""4. Each and all of the matters and things hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was in the public domain or a matter of public  knowledge or of general knowledge in the trade or industry concerned with the design or manufacture of valves or valve  components before any of said matters or things was assertedly conceived, invented, designed or developed by Futurecraft, or  in any event before Koutnik terminated his employment at Futurecraft on or about March 17, 1956. ""5. Each and all of the matters and things hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was known in the art relating to the design or  manufacture of valves or valve components, that is to say, was known through patents or applications therefor or through  published or utilized materials, ideas, principles, devices or methods relating to such art, before any of said matters or things  was assertedly conceived, invented, designed or developed by Futurecraft.  In this connection all of the allegations contained in  the fourth affirmative defense appearing in the respective answers of Koutnik and Clary are true. ""6. If any matter or thing hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 3 was ever confidential to, or a trade secret of, Futurecraft, every  element of confidence or secrecy with respect thereto was made public knowledge, or in any event was lost to Futurecraft, either  through deliveries or sales by Futurecraft to its customers or prospective customers of the valves and valve components referred  to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint, or through some action taken by the customer or  prospective customer subsequent to such sale or delivery, or through drawings showing the internal arrangement of the parts  and the design of such valves and valve components delivered by Futurecraft to said customers or prospective customers. Said  sales or deliveries commenced in or about September 1953 and have continued to a date not earlier than June 1958.  Many of  the sales and deliveries of each type of valve and valve component mentioned in said Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX were made",
88,"by Futurecraft without imposing, or seeking to impose, any restriction or limitation upon the purchaser or recipient thereof with  reference to the use to which such valve or valve component could be put or the disposition which the purchaser or recipient  could make of the same.  In this connection, with certain exceptions the purchasers and/or recipients of said valves, valve  components and/or drawings do not stand in any confidential or fiduciary relation toward Futurecraft with reference to any matter  or thing disclosed by said valves, valve components or drawings. ""7. Each and all of the matters and things alleged to be confidential to Futurecraft with regard to each of the valves and valve  components referred to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint were contained in, and were  easily ascertainable from, the valves and valve components so sold and/or delivered as hereinabove mentioned in Paragraph 6. ""8. Each and all of the valves and valve components which were sold by Futurecraft, as hereinabove referred to in Paragraph 6,  were sold with Futurecraft's knowledge that the same were purchased by the customer for resale by said customer. ""9. The form of proprietary notice placed by Futurecraft upon certain of its drawings of the valves and valve components referred  to in Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint was not intended by Futurecraft to impose, nor did  it impose, any restriction or limitation upon any customer or prospective customer of Futurecraft, or any ultimate customer or  prospective customer of any such valve or valve component, with regard to the use to which such valve or valve component  could be put or the disposition which the customer or prospective customer could make of the same. ""10. As early as September 1953, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valves of the type referred to in  Paragraph V of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""11. As early as April 1954, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valve components of the type referred  to in Paragraph VI of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""12. As early as December 1957, and thereafter Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restrictions whatsoever, valve components  of the type referred to in Paragraph VII of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""13. As early as August 1956, Futurecraft publicly sold, without any restriction whatsoever, valves of the type referred to in  Paragraph IX of the first cause of action of the complaint. ""14. After terminating his employment with Futurecraft on or about March 17, 1956, Koutnik neither carried any trust  responsibility nor owed any obligation to Futurecraft with reference to any of the valves or valve components mentioned in  Paragraphs V, VI, VII and IX of the first cause of action of the complaint or any of the matters or things allegedly confidential to  Futurecraft with respect to said valves or valve components, nor did any contractual relation exist between Koutnik and  Futurecraft at any time after such termination of employment. ""15. No controversy now exists or ever did exist, between Futurecraft, on the one hand, and Koutnik or Clary, or either of them,  on the other, concerning the rights, obligations or liabilities of any party to this action under or by virtue of any portion or claim of,  or any amendment to, the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 508,444, or the assignment to Futurecraft of the  invention described in said application, which said application and assignment are referred to in Paragraph V of the first cause of  action of the complaint; and nothing in said application or assignment prevents Koutnik or Clary from establishing the source of  the disclosure in said patent application or the lack of secrecy with respect to said disclosure. ""16. If any matter or thing contained in the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 508,444, mentioned in Paragraph V  of the first cause of action of the complaint, or in the application for United States Letters Patent, No. 632,828, mentioned in  Paragraph IX of said cause of action, or any amendment to either of said applications, was ever confidential to, or a trade secret  of, Futurecraft, Futurecraft elected by sale of valves embodying the disclosure of said applications and the filing of said  applications and by taking advantage of the provisions of  35 U.S.C. Â§ 102 , to rely upon the patent laws of the United States and  is precluded from asserting that the subject matter of said applications, or either of them, constitute a trade secret. ""From the foregoing findings of fact the court draws the following: ""Conclusions of Law ""The court concludes: ""1. In all respects as set forth in the foregoing findings of fact. ""2. Said findings having been made upon issues which are determinative of the cause, any further finding or findings upon  issues other than those embraced in the foregoing findings would be immaterial and are not made for that reason.",

California Constitution, article XX, section 22  in relevant part provides: ""The department shall have the power, in its discretion, to  deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverage license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or  continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals, . . ."" Section 24200  provides in relevant part: ""The following are the grounds which constitute a basis for the suspension or the  revocation of licenses: . . . (b) Except as limited by Chapters 11 and 12 of this division, the violation or the causing or the  permitting of a violation by a licensee of this division, . . . or any rules of the department adopted pursuant to the provisions of  this division, or any other penal provisions of law of this State prohibiting or regulating the sale . . . of alcoholic beverages or  intoxicating liquors."" The matter was submitted below on the petition, return, and record of the administrative proceedings had before the  Department which included a transcript of the oral proceedings and certain documentary evidence received.  The entire  administrative file, together with the opinion of the Appeals Board, has been transmitted here. The finding did not extend to all items of alcoholic beverages involved.  The court found there  was  substantial evidence that the  minimum retail prices of three brands of beverages and the schedules filed with the Department were fixed and agreed upon  between the manufacturers or brand owners and retail off-sale licensees.",
115,"As pointed out above (see footnote 4) the relevant finding in the trial court was unfavorable to the Department on all but three  items set forth in the accusation. The Department makes no argument on the ninth count which was reversed by the Appeals Board. It is unnecessary to detail the licensees' meticulous objections to each item of documentary evidence.  Generally speaking,  they were made on the grounds that the fair trade contracts were not in fact contracts because the parties thereto made no  engagement to sell or buy to or from each other; that the contracts created no mutually binding obligations; that the parties  signatory to the agreements did not in every instance agree to the fair trade prices revised and appended to the agreements  after their execution; and that there was no showing that the beverages listed in the agreements were, at the time of the sales  involved, in fair and open competition with alcoholic beverages of the same general class produced by others. The certification made under oath by the special assistant to the Director of Alcoholic Beverage Control states that such person  is the ""legal custodian of the fair trade contracts and fair trade contract price schedules required by law to be filed with the  Department.  . . .""",
116,"HN6 [ ]  Section 24750  provides: ""No contract relating to the sale or resale of any alcoholic beverage which bears, or the label  or container of which bears, the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner of the alcoholic beverage and which is in  fair and open competition with alcoholic beverages of the same general class produced by others violates any law of this State  by reason of either of the following provisions which may be contained in such contract: ""(a) That the buyer will not resell the alcoholic beverage except at the price stipulated by the vendor. ""(b) That the producer or vendee of the alcoholic beverage require, upon the sale of the alcoholic beverage to another, that the  purchaser agree that he will not, in turn, resell except at the price stipulated by the producer or vendee."" Section 24755 , at the times here involved, read as follows: ""All distilled spirits sold at retail shall be, and any other alcoholic  beverage may be, sold pursuant to a contract executed pursuant to this chapter, except that Chapter 11 shall govern the sale of  wine in all cases in which that chapter is applicable.  No licensee shall violate any of the provisions of any such contract."" The foregoing section was repealed in 1961 (Stats. 1961, ch. 635, Â§ 3) and a new section bearing the same number added  (Stats. 1961, ch. 635, Â§ 4), which, in respect to distilled spirits bearing the brand, trademark or name of the owner or person in  control, prohibits any retail sale for consumption off the licensed premises unless a minimum retail price has first been filed with  the Department pursuant to the section and further prohibits any sale by an off-sale licensee ""at any price less than the effective  filed price.""",
117,"Former rule 99, subdivisions (a), (b) and (f) in relevant part provided: ""(a) No manufacturer, manufacturer's agent, wholesaler  or rectifier shall sell distilled spirits the containers of which bear labels stating the brand or name of the owner or producer, in this  State, except pursuant to a fair trade contract, as provided for by  Sections 24750 to 24755  of the Alcoholic Beverage Control  Act. ""(b) Every manufacturer, manufacturer's agent, wholesaler, or rectifier licensed in this State who owns or controls a brand of  distilled spirits, or who is properly authorized to fair trade a brand of distilled spirits in this State, shall file with the department a  copy of a fair trade contract, or a notice of the amendment of an existing fair trade contract, and four copies of minimum resale  price schedules.  . . . ""(f) No licensee shall advertise or offer for sale, or sell, alcoholic beverages at retail at a price less than the stipulated minimum  resale price provided for by a fair trade contract filed with the department pursuant to this rule."" (This rule has been revised and recast.  As presently in effect, it provides  inter alia  for the filing of a ""Distilled Spirits Minimum  Retail Price Schedule"" and prohibits sales by off-sale licensees at a price less than that filed with the Department unless written  permission is granted.) Allied Properties  was decided on November 30, 1959, thus disposing of the licensees' contention made in their amended  notice of defense filed in the administrative proceedings on November 6, 1957, that  section 24755  and rule 99 were  unconstitutional.  Although the licensees restated this contention in their petition for writ of mandate filed March 29, 1960,  subsequent to the  Allied Properties  decision, they have not pressed such contention before us. Items involved were: White Horse Scotch, Old Charter straight bourbon, Jim Beam straight bourbon, Paul Jones blended  whiskey, Old Crow straight bourbon, Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch whiskey, Old Hermitage blended whiskey, I. W. Harper  bonded bourbon, Canada Dry blended whiskey and Canada Dry Gin. This wholesaler's form of fair trade agreement was introduced in evidence apparently because its attached price list fixed not  only the ""owners'"" prevailing prices to wholesalers and retailers but also the ""owners'"" resale prices to consumers in California.",
118,"Illustrative of the retailer's covenant is the following paragraph from the fair trade agreement fixing the fair trade price for White  Horse Scotch Whiskey, an item alleged in the first count of the accusation: ""Purchaser agrees that he will not sell advertise for  sale or offer to sell any person, firm or corporation, any of the products named in the Resale Price Schedule as now filed or  hereafter amended at prices below those therein specified.  Seller further agrees that he will not use any of the products listed in  any free deals, or make or offer to make any refunds discounts or concessions, or make or offer to make combination sales or  transactions which shall result in a reduction of the resale prices therein established."" Although there is a variation of language among all agreements, the above is a fair summary of their salient features.  It is to  be noted that the reserved right in the seller to revise the schedule of prices and the agreement of the buyer to be bound thereby  are present in all contracts.",
119,"Our attention has also been directed to the opinion of the Appeals Board in an unrelated case ( Appeal of Moeslein , No. AB- 794) in which it was held that there was no requirement that fair trade contracts be also contracts for the sale of distilled spirits.",
120,"Rule 99(b) required the filing with the Department of a copy of the contract and four copies of minimum resale price schedules.   Attached to each of six of the contracts in evidence as part of the exhibits is a schedule of prices entitled ""Distilled Spirits Fair  Trade Schedule.""",
122,"HN14 [ ]   Government Code section 11515  in relevant part states: ""Parties present at the hearing shall be informed of the  matters to be noticed, and those matters shall be noted in the record, referred to therein, or appended thereto.  Any such party  shall be given a reasonable opportunity on request to refute the officially noticed matters by evidence or by written or oral  presentation of authority, the manner of such refutation to be determined by the agency.""",
123,"That portion of rule 99(b) relevant here provided as follows: ""Amendments to such contracts affecting changes in minimum  resale prices for a brand, type and size of container previously filed shall be filed with the department on or before the fifteenth  day of any calendar month to become effective on the first day of the second succeeding calendar month.  To meet competitive  prices for similar distilled spirits, amendments to fair trade contracts may be filed with the department on or before the fifteenth  day of any calendar month and such amended competitive price shall become effective at the same time the competitive price  for similar distilled spirits shall become effective."" For portions of rule 99 heretofore set forth, see footnote 11,  supra . For example, the finding with respect to Count I was as follows: ""It is true that on or about August 28, 1956, the above-named  licensee, at the above-mentioned premises, did sell alcoholic beverages, to-wit, Scotch Whiskey, at retail to the W. P. Fuller  Company, 301 Mission Street, San Francisco, at a price less than the stipulated minimum resale price provided for in a fair trade  contract duly filed with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control as follows: . . ."" Description of brands and prices follows.",
124,"In  Jones v. Maloney (1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 80, 89-90 [234 P.2d 666] , this court said that such ""determination"" was  comparable to a trial court's ""conclusions of law."" Rule 17(e) as it then read provided: ""(e) No alcoholic beverage shall leave the premises of an off-sale licensee for delivery to a  consumer, except pursuant to an order previously received by such licensee. Such alcoholic beverages shall be accompanied  by a delivery order, which order must state the quantity, brand, proof, and price of such alcoholic beverages, and the name and  address of the consumer purchaser, and shall have printed or stamped thereon the name and address of such off-sale licensee.  A copy of such order shall be kept on file by the off-sale licensee for a period of two years after the date of delivery.""",

HN4 [ ] Â§ 24755, as it read during the period of time covered by the accusation herein, required all retail sales of distilled  spirits to be made pursuant to fair trade contracts executed pursuant to chapter 10 (Â§Â§ 24750-24757) and prohibited any  violations of such contracts.  (Â§ 24750 as it read during the same period of time, and as it now reads, authorized fair trade  contracts fixing the resale price of alcoholic beverages bearing the trademark, brand or name of the producer or owner and in  fair and open competition with others of the same general class.) Unless otherwise indicated all code references hereafter are to the Business and Professions Code. HN5 [ ]  Â§ 99, subd. (f) , and  subds. (a)  and  (b)  of said section, which are also applicable to the instant case, as said rule and  subdivisions read at the time covered by the accusation herein, provided in substance that no manufacturer, manufacturer's  agent, wholesaler or rectifier was permitted to sell distilled spirits in containers bearing brands or names of owners except  pursuant to fair trade contracts; that copies of such fair trade contracts should be filed with the Department, together with copies  of minimum resale price schedules; and that no licensee should sell beverages at retail at a price less than the minimum resale  price fixed by such fair trade contract. Said notice of defense objected to the accusation and requested its dismissal on the following grounds: (1) That  Bus. & Prof. Code, Â§ 24755  and rule 99 of the Cal. Admin. Code are unconstitutional. (2) That the alcoholic beverages subject of the accusation are not in free and open competition with alcoholic beverages of the  same general class produced by others within the meaning of the laws exempting price fixing from the public policy of the state. (3) That the contracts under which the ""'fair trade prices'"" are alleged to have been stipulated or fixed are within the provisions of  the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Cartwright Act of the State of California. (4) That rule 99 of the Cal. Admin. Code is violative of the terms of Â§ 25750 (obviously intended as  Â§ 24750 ) of the Bus. & Prof.  Code and  Â§ 11374 of the Gov. Code  and is also inconsistent with the provisions of  Â§ 24200, subd. (b) of the Bus. & Prof. Code . (5) That the fair trade prices are not supported by a valid contract. Exhibit No. 1 was a contract entered into between Affiliated Distillers Brands Corp., a distributor of alcoholic beverages bearing  the label or brand of Ancient Age whiskey, among others, and Excelsior W. & L., a retailer. Exhibit No. 2 was a contract entered into between Haas Bros., the owner of the Cyrus Noble label, and P. & S. Liquor Store, a  retailer.",
133,"These prices were higher than those admittedly charged by the licensees for the two brands to the persons and at the times  charged by the accusation. The record discloses that these exhibits were only received for identification and that the specific objections thereto were  never formally ruled upon.  No error is assigned by the licensees in respect to such omission.  The specific objections interposed  upon the presentation of these exhibits were substantially the same as those specified in the notice of defense which the hearing  officer overruled.  It is also apparent from the hearing officer's proposed decision that the finding against the licensees on the  issue to which these exhibits were directed was in effect a ruling overruling the objection.  (See  Van Haaren v. Whitmore, 2  Cal.App.2d 632, 634 [38 P.2d 829] ;  Citizens' Bank of Los Angeles v. Jones, 121 Cal. 30, 33 [53 P. 354] .) Moreover, both parties  throughout the proceedings below and on this appeal have considered and treated these exhibits as having been admitted into  evidence.  It is well established that  HN6 [ ] where the record shows that a document has been considered by the court and the  parties as being in evidence, a reviewing court will not look for technical reasons to exclude from consideration any part of the  record which was before the court below.  (  Mann v. Mann, 76 Cal.App.2d 32, 41-42 [172 P.2d 369] ;  Estate of Pailhe, 114  Cal.App.2d 658, 664 [251 P.2d 76] ;  Reed v. Reed, 128 Cal.App.2d 786, 790-791 [276 P.2d 36] ; see also  Miller v.

Furthermore, it should be noted that at the conclusion of the hearing counsel for licensees conceded that there  were no factual disparities involved and that the parties were ""generally agreed on the factual basis.  . . .""

135,"Except for licensees involved, the brands of the alcoholic beverages entailed in the accusation, the dates of sale, the prices  charged, and the persons to whom sold, the essential facts are almost identical.  In  DeMartini  the accusation contained nine  counts.  The first seven counts involved alleged fair trade violation and the last two counts charged the sale and delivery of the  beverages designated in the said first seven counts without accompanying delivery orders and the keeping on file copies  thereof.  The subject matter of the last two counts is not involved in the instant case.  The only other significant point of  distinction does not go to the facts but to disposition of the matter by the trial court.  In  DeMartini  the trial court ordered the  issuance of a peremptory writ commanding the Department to vacate and set aside its decision that the license of the licensees  be suspended, and the appeal from such judgment was by the Department.  (There was also a cross-appeal by the licensees  from that part of the judgment which commanded the Department to take such further steps in the proceedings against them as  were not inconsistent with the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.)

Opinion Organized in December 1960 -- the new local division of the American Osteopathic Association, which division succeeded the  California Osteopathic Association as such local division when it allegedly was expelled by the American Osteopathic  Association for entering into the merger agreement.",
144,"The merger agreement (omitting the schedules and signatures) is as follows: ""This Agreement is made and entered into this -- day of May, 1961, by and between the California Medical Association, an  unincorporated association, hereinafter sometimes called the 'CMA' and the California Osteopathic Association, a California  corporation, hereinafter sometimes called the 'COA,' to be effective at the time, and upon the terms and conditions as hereinafter  set forth below. ""A.  General. 1.  Purposes .  This agreement is made and entered into for the primary purposes of improving the health services available to the  citizens of the State of California, and expanding medical teaching facilities in the State.  The 'Governor's Committee on the  Study of Medical Aid and Health' has urged immediate expansion of 'medical educational capacity in private and public  institutions' and the establishment of new medical schools.  These purposes are to be further accomplished by the unification,",
145,"consonant with the desires of individual practicing physicians within the State of California, of the separate organizations which  have heretofore existed in parallel structure in the State of California for the practice of medicine and surgery by persons who  hold the degree of Doctor of Osteopathy and those who hold the degree of Doctor of Medicine. By accomplishing such  unification, the parties hereto intend to remove any distinction among the individuals practicing medicine and surgery that is not  related to skill and ability, to make available to the public at large efficient and adequate hospital facilities, and to improve the  educational facilities available for those persons engaged in the practice of medicine and surgery.  It is also a primary purpose of  the parties hereto that upon the students at the present College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons in Los Angeles or its  successor becoming eligible to be licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, no new or additional physician and  surgeon's certificates shall thereafter be issued by the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners, whether applied for under Articles  5, 6 or 11 of Chapter 5, Division 2, of the California Business and Professions Code.  It is not the purpose of any party to this  agreement to alter or diminish in any way the practice rights of individual physicians, or to limit their opportunity of future  practice. ""2.  Execution and effective date .  Upon approval of this agreement by the governing boards of the respective parties hereto, this  agreement shall be executed by the Chairman of such board and its Secretary.  Said signatures shall indicate the approval of  that board only. ""This agreement shall become binding and effective when it has been ratified by the House of Delegates of each of the parties  hereto, in accordance with the appropriate rules and regulations of each respective organization. ""The parties hereto recognize and acknowledge that the consummation of this agreement will require certain amendments to be  made to the constitution of the CMA, and that the constitution requires that a proposed amendment, after introduction, lay on the  table for a period of one year prior to its final adoption and effectiveness.  This agreement, however, shall become effective upon  its initial ratification by both houses as above set forth, subject only to the conditions hereinafter set forth. ""3.  Reference to COA .  As hereinafter provided, the COA agrees to change its name, and may in the course of the transition  period change its organic structure.  References to COA shall thus include such organization, although its name shall be  changed, and its organic structure may be changed. ""B.  Matters Related to the Structure of California Medical Association. ""1.  Amendments to Constitution and By-Laws .  The Council of the CMA shall propose to its House of Delegates two  amendments to the constitution, and one amendment to the by-laws of the CMA, as set forth on Exhibits A, B, and C,  respectively, attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. ""The House of Delegates of the CMA shall, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this contract, approve and adopt said  amendments. ""2.  Issuance of new charter to component society .  Upon said amendments becoming finally effective, the COA agrees (a) to  change its name to the Forty-First Medical Society or such other name as may be jointly approved by the Board of Trustees of  the COA and the Executive Secretary of CMA, and thereafter, (b) to apply for a charter as a component society of the CMA.  The  CMA agrees to issue such charter. The terms and conditions of the charter to be applied for, and to be issued, shall be as set  forth on Schedule D attached hereto, and made a part hereof by reference. ""3.  Dissolution of COA .  The parties hereto acknowledge that the structure herein agreed upon for the issuance of a charter to a  statewide organization under such new name is intended only as an interim measure.  It is the intention of both parties hereto  that all persons who are members of such society shall become members of their respective county medical societies as soon  as possible.  However, such arrangement requires the consent of each of the respective county medical societies.  When the  county medical societies ""throughout the State of California agree to take into membership in the respective appropriate county  medical society each of the members of such society, it shall be dissolved.  Upon such dissolution, all of the assets then  remaining of such society shall, so far as is legally possible, be transferred and conveyed to the College of Osteopathic  Physicians and Surgeons, or its successor. ""C.  Practice of Medicine and Use of Degree. ""The parties hereto contemplate that individual members of the COA who hold physicians and surgeons certificates in the State  of California will obtain a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons or its  successor. The CMA agrees to accept such procedures which may be agreed upon by the Advisory Educational Committee,  created by the joint action of the parties hereto, as to the manner in which said degrees shall be granted, provided, however, that",
146,"the agreed procedures do not jeopardize accreditation of the College.  Both parties hereto agree to recognize such degrees as  an M.D. degree issued by an accredited medical school. ""D.  Statutory Amendments. ""1.  Use of Degree .  Both parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the legislature of the State of California  statutory amendments as set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference.  The parties hereto  contemplate that where persons hold a degree of Doctor of Medicine and a degree of Doctor of Osteopathy, such person shall  be required to elect to practice under one or the other of such degrees, and to advise both the Board of Medical Examiners and  the Board of Osteopathic Examiners of such election. ""2  Boards of Examiners .  Both parties agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the California Legislature the statutory  amendments relating to the structure of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California and regarding the reciprocity  statutes affecting such board, as set forth on Schedule F, attached hereto and made a part hereof. ""3.  Initiative Act .  Both parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to have adopted by the legislature and by the people of the  State of California, the proposal set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and made a part hereof, regarding the initiative act  establishing the Board of Osteopathic Examiners. ""E.  College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons. ""1.  Agreement with College .  The COA agrees to negotiate a contract with the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons  covering the matters hereinafter set forth. In the event that the COA is unable to enter into such an agreement, the CMA shall  have its option to declare this contract entirely null and void.  Said contract shall contain: ""(a) A procedure for the issuance of degree of Doctor of Medicine to doctors of Osteopathy presently licensed as physicians and  surgeons in the State of California. ""(b) An agreement that said College shall use its best efforts to obtain approval by the Council on Medical Education and  Hospitals and membership in the Association of American Medical Colleges. ""(c) The name of the College shall be changed, so that neither the word 'osteopathic' nor any similar word shall be used therein. ""2.  Agreements relating to College . ""(a) The parties hereto shall jointly use their best efforts to secure appropriate administrative rules or statutory changes to permit  students currently enrolled in the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons to be eligible for examination by the licensing  board of their choice: and ""(b) The parties hereto shall agree with each other, and with the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons as follows: ""(i) The COA shall continue to contribute to the College fund for its operation at the rate of a minimum of $ 225,000.00 per year  until one year from the time all conditions set forth in this agreement are met.  Thereafter, for an additional four years, COA and  its successor shall allocate to the College at least Fifty Dollars ($ 50.00) per regular member per year, payable from the annual  dues it charges its members (not including therein dues it pays to the CMA and the American Medical Association). ""'Regular member' shall not include persons granted reduced rate of dues for any reason.  The CMA and the COA shall jointly  guarantee to the College that it shall receive funds in at least said amount of $ 225,000.00 per year payable quarterly from the  sources herein indicated for an additional period of four years thereafter.  As between the CMA and the COA, the CMA will  agree to supply said funds to said amount during said four year period to the extent that the COA or its successor does not do  so.  The funds to be supplied under this paragraph may come from said organization ""directly, or may come from contributions  from public or private sources, from funds or foundations, or otherwise, so long as they are arranged directly by the persons  associated with and acting for the COA or the CMA. ""(ii) In the event that adequate arrangements for the financing of the College have not been concluded after said period, the  COA and the CMA jointly declare their intention of seeing that the College has adequate operating funds to make up for the loss  of funds which otherwise might have been paid by the COA had this agreement not been entered into.  However, this expression  of intention is made without binding obligation on the parties hereto at this time. ""(c)  Accreditation .  Both parties hereto shall use their best efforts to see that the College of Osteopathic Physicians and  Surgeons, or its successor, is accredited as a medical school as soon as possible.",
147,"""F.  Practice Rights. ""1.  General .  As hereinabove set forth, both parties hereto acknowledge and declare that this agreement is not intended in any  way to limit the practice rights of individual physicians. ""2.  Hospitals .  The parties hereto shall join in a joint statement of policy with respect to practice rights and hospital privileges of  physicians, to be forwarded to all hospitals in the State of California.  A copy of such joint declaration is attached hereto marked  'Exhibit H' and made a part hereof by reference. ""3.  Specialty Rights .  The parties hereto shall issue a joint declaration with respect to the specialty privileges of individual  physicians, a copy of which joint statement is attached hereto marked 'Exhibit I' and made a part hereof by reference.  A copy of  such declaration shall be forwarded to all hospitals, and to all physicians and surgeons in the State of California. ""4.  Removal of Distinctions .  Both parties hereto shall use their best efforts, on a continuing basis, to remove any distinction  between or among persons holding a certificate as physician and surgeon in the State of California and a degree of Doctor of  Medicine, where such distinction is based solely upon the ground that any such person previously held or now holds a degree of  Doctor of Osteopathy. ""5.  Evaluation Groups .  The CMA agrees that the COA may continue for the purpose of serving its own members, such specialty  and other evaluation groups as may have been established by it on or before April 1, 1961, and whose criteria shall be not less  than those shown in a separate document entitled: 'Criteria of Evaluation Groups, California Osteopathic Association' heretofore  delivered to the CMA by the COA.  All records of such evaluation and specialty groups shall be made available to the  Commission on Medical Education of the CMA for examination and review. ""G.  Time Schedule and Conditions. ""1.  Conditions Precedent .  As hereinabove set forth, this agreement shall become effective upon ratification by the House of  Delegates of both of the parties hereto.  However, this agreement shall have no force or effect of any kind, unless the following  conditions are met within the time periods hereinafter set forth. ""(a)  Final adoption of constitutional amendments .  The final adoption of the constitutional amendment set forth on Exhibits A and  B attached hereto shall take place on or before May 15, 1962. ""(b)  Approval of College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons .  The College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons or its  successor shall be approved by the State Board of Medical Examiners on or before May 15, 1962. ""(c)  Hospitals .

""(ii) That Doctors of Osteopathy who have received a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the College of Osteopathic Physicians  and Surgeons, or its successor under the procedure to be determined upon, will be recognized as persons holding degrees of  Doctor of Medicine from an approved medical school for all purposes connected with the approval of hospitals. ""In the event that any of said conditions have not been met by the time herein set forth, the COA shall have the option of waiving  such condition and continuing this agreement in effect, or of terminating this agreement and declaring it to be entirely void and of  no effect. ""When all of such conditions have been either met, or waived by the COA, whether before or at the time limit set forth herein,  each party shall immediately undertake performance of all things to be performed by it herein. ""5.  Time table .  The parties shall immediately begin their efforts to have those legislative amendments set forth on Schedule E  adopted and approved. ""The parties shall attempt to have those legislative and initiative measures approved as set forth on Schedules F and G as soon  as all of the conditions precedent in this agreement have been met.  The parties contemplate that such conditions shall all be  met on or before May 15, 1962. ""H.  Miscellaneous.",
148,"""1.  Phraseology .  The phraseology included herein in connection with the proposed amendments to the constitution and by-laws  of the CMA, proposed statutory enactments and initiative enactment, is used for the purpose of setting forth the general intention  of the parties hereto, and a change in the terminology used shall not be deemed to alter the effect or interfere with the  performance of this agreement in any way, so long as it accomplishes the underlying intention of the respective provisions  involved.

159,"Sixty-five per cent of all leagues are formed by trade, professional or fraternal groups; the remainder by bowling establishments  for revenue-producing purposes. The contract specifies the price to be paid for the league's bowling, the period of time during which the league undertakes to  bowl, and the hour and location of its bowling with the establishment. The individual bowler is under an obligation to bowl the  complete season for which the contract is made.  He can withdraw from the league only if he provides a replacement bowler.  Failure to provide a replacement subjects him to possible suspension from membership in the bowlers' associations. The winter season of 30-33 weeks lasts from September through May; the summer season of 12 weeks from May until August. In 1959, Norcal approved 30 such tournaments; in 1962, 48; during the first 8 months of 1963, 34. As a league season consists of about 100 games, usually three games per week in each of the 30-33 weeks of the season,  there are obvious practical limitations in the number of leagues any one bowler can participate in.  A national survey made by  ABC in 1956-57, indicated that 89 per cent of its then 2.5 million members bowled in only one league.",
160,"Defendants erroneously characterize the issue as one of fact, i.e., the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the court's findings  and conclusions about the modified eligibility rule.  Since defendants have abandoned their appeal, the sufficiency of the  evidence is not in issue and must be presumed. Cases based on the Clayton Act, however, are not applicable since that act is broader in its scope and prohibitions (  Rolley,  Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, Inc., 129 Cal.App.2d 844 [278 P.2d 63, 282 P.2d 991] ).",

When the case was originally called for trial it was continued four days so that counsel could brief the legal issues  involved. At the continued hearing the court recognized the jurisdictional question involved by the juxtaposition of the principles  set forth in this and in the immediately preceding footnotes. Nevertheless, it elected to proceed to dispose of the case on the  issue presented by defendant's first separate defense as applied to the facts admitted in the pleadings. In so doing the court was  acting within the jurisdiction of the superior court. ""The superior court is not under the same disability as the municipal court. The  fifth paragraph of section 396 provides: 'Nothing herein shall be construed to  require  the  superior   court  to transfer any action or  proceeding because the judgment to be rendered, as determined at the trial or hearing, is one which might have been rendered  by a municipal or justice court in the same county or city and county.' (Emphasis added.) The effect of this paragraph is to qualify  the second paragraph of section 396 as to superior courts only. It gives such courts the discretion either to transfer back to the  municipal courts or retain jurisdiction where what otherwise would he a lack of jurisdiction is 'determined at the trial or bearing.'""

The  parties have tacitly recognized the jurisdiction of the court to so proceed by failing to mention the issues discussed in this  footnote in their briefs. The allegations read: ""III. For many years prior to the establishment of the BID DEPOSITORY, more particularly hereinafter  described and referred to, the construction trades in Alameda County and vicinity were plagued with the practices of 'bid  peddling' which refers to the disclosure, for the purpose of obtaining a more favorable bid, by a general contractor of one  subcontractor's bid to a competing subcontractor prior to award, and the practice of 'bid shopping' which refers to such  disclosure for the same purpose after an award has been made to a general contractor.  ""IV. In order to combat the practices aforesaid, and as a service to contractors in the construction trades, whether members of  plaintiff or not, plaintiff heretofore has established the OAKLAND-ALAMEDA COUNTY BUILDERS' EXCHANGE BID  DEPOSITORY, hereinafter called BID DEPOSITORY, which is a facility established, maintained and operated by plaintiff",

Rptr. 378  the case was  analyzed as follows: ""In the  Inland Bid Depository  case, the court held that group boycotts were illegal per se, constituting  restraints on trade in violation of the Cartwright Act. The court further held that a bid depository could not be allowed to operate  under rules which (1) prevent, preclude or in any manner limit any subcontractor from submitting a bid to a general contractor or  awarding authority on any construction project at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the receipt of bids  upon any such construction project (2) limit or restrict, in any way, the amount of a bid submitted by a subcontractor to a general  contractor or awarding authority at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the receipt of bids upon a  construction project; or (3) limit or in any way prevent a general contractor or awarding authority from receiving or considering  any bid which is or may be submitted to him by a subcontractor at any time prior to the time set by the awarding authority for the  receipt of bids upon a construction project."" (272 A.C.A. at p. 450,  77 Cal. Rptr. at p. 380 .) In Carl N. Swenson Co. v. E. C. Braun Co., supra, 272 A.C.A. 447,  77 Cal. Rptr. 378 , the court upheld a judgment which  denied the general contractor the right to recover from a subcontractor on an arbitration award made under bid depository rules  following the allegedly improper withdrawal of the subcontractor's bid. (Cf.   Drennan v. Star Paving Co. (1958) 51 Cal. 2d 409,  415, 333 P.2d 757 .) The court concluded that analysis of rules which limited the time and the manner in which a subcontractor's  bid could be withdrawn ""effectively demonstrates that said provisions, when viewed in the context of the other bid depository  rules which prohibit depository users from submitting or receiving bids outside the depository, do tend to stifle competition  between subcontractors and do further an illegal restraint of trade within the meaning of the  Inland Bid Depository  case."" (272  A.C.A. at p. 453,  77 Cal. Rptr. at pp. 381-82 .) In that case a bearing was denied by the Supreme Court on June 25, 1969,  Tobriner, J. voting for hearing. (See Tobriner & Jaffe, Revision of the Anti-Trust Laws (1932) 20 Cal.L.Rev. 585.) This refusal to  examine the questions presented in the  Inland Bid Depository  case insofar as they were carried forward in the later case, may  be balanced against the denial of a bearing by the  Supreme Court in Associated Plumbing Contractors of Marin etc. Counties,  Inc. v. F. W. Spencer & Son, Inc. (1963) 213 Cal. App. 2d 1, 28 Cal. Rptr. 425 , when the court stated, "" * * * the trial court  properly concluded that such restraints of trade as existed under the rules of the two associations were reasonable restraints of  trade in the public interest and justified by the circumstances."" ( 213 Cal. App. 2d at p. 8, 28 Cal. Rptr. at p. 429 .)",
199,"In fact the admitted facts tend to support a contrary finding. The defendant, which apparently considered itself free to shop the  bids received from him prior to the award of the general contract, was apparently only able to secure more favorable terms in  three of the seven categories in which he requested and accepted bids. That he secured more favorable terms is an assumption  that goes beyond the admitted facts. From all that appears the general contractor may have rejected the bids tendered for steel  decking by the bid depository, and the subcontractors be selected for painting and carpeting may in fact have been selected for  an equal price or on terms which permitted an equal or greater price if the general contractor was successful in getting the  award.  See, Note, op. cit., fn. 1, supra, 53 Va.L.Rev. at page 1724, ""As bid shopping becomes widespread in a given area, subs puff  their instant bids to leave room for later negotiations, thus fictionalizing the bidding process.""

See, Schultz, op. cit., fn. 1 above, 19 U. of Ch.L.Rev. at pp. 280-281, and at p. 285, where he states, ""Possibly, the firm offer  provision will be a boon to the owner, the one whom sub and general are supposed to serve, in terms of more efficient  construction at lower costs.""",

240,"Defendants contend that Saxer should not be allowed to act as both class representative and as one of the attorneys for the  class.  This contention lacks merit inasmuch as the court in  Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., 67 Cal.2d 695 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d  732] , implicitly sanctioned such dual representation. The Cartwright Act provides in part: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the  following purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  . . .  (c) To prevent competition in  manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.  . . .  (e) To make or enter  into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any or  any combination of any of the following: . . .  (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may  have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.""  ( Bus. & Prof. Code, Â§ 16720 .)   Section 16702 of the Business and Professions Code  defines ""persons"" as "". . . corporations, firms, partnerships and  associations existing under or authorized by the laws of this State or any other State, or any foreign country.""   Section 16726 of the Business and Professions Code  states: ""Except as provided [herein] . . . , every trust is unlawful, against  public policy and void.""",
241,"Saxer initially argues that  section 16756 of the Business and Professions Code  outlines the pleading requirements for a  Cartwright Act violation in a civil action.  However, this contention was considered and rejected in  Chicago Title, supra, 69 Cal.2d  at pages 317-318 .",

255,"Respondent at oral argument advanced for the first time the theory of justification based upon the giving of advice as described  in the  Restatement of Torts section 772 , and discussed in  Walsh v. Glendale Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. (1969) 1 Cal.App.3d  578, 588-589 [81 Cal.Rptr. 804] . Reliance on this theory is misplaced since, as pointed out in comment a to the  Restatement of  Torts section 772 , one of the conditions of such justification is ""(1) that the advice be requested, . . ."" In the case at bench  nothing in the allegations of the Second Complaint remotely suggests that respondent was requested by the prospective  purchasers to give them any advice concerning the purchase of appellant's business.",

App. 3d 31 Core Terms Opinion Though the complaint purported to state only one cause of action, it also alleged a breach of contract, with plaintiff claiming to  be a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between Western World and its insured. In her response to demurrer  plaintiff characterized this allegation as ""surplusage,"" and no question with respect thereto is raised on appeal. It would appear in  any event that third party beneficiary analysis would avail plaintiff nothing.",
260,"Unless otherwise indicated all statutory references are to the Insurance Code.   The reason for this was that the business of insurance was not deemed commerce within the meaning of the Commerce  Clause (U.S.  Const., art. I, Â§ 8 ,  cl. 3 ). (  Paul v. Virginia (1868) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168, 183 [19 L.Ed. 357, 361] .)  ""Congress declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public  interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier or taxation of such business  by the several states."" ( 15 U.S.C.A.  Â§ 1011 .)  ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or  intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" (15 U.S.C.A.

261,"It does not appear that the amount of the judgment against Circle K Riding Stables was in excess of its insurance coverage. In  any case appellant did not sue as assignee of any right of action Circle K might have against its insurer.  The granting of petition for hearing in Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (3 Civ. 17489) on June 1, 1978, places the issue  before our Supreme Court.   Of related interest is the court's rejection ( 17 Cal.3d at p. 946 ) of the further argument that plaintiff could proceed against the  insurer for breach of the duty owed to its insured by way of a creditors' suit under  Code of Civil Procedure, section 720 .",

267,"Opinion HN1 [ ]  Section 11180, Government Code reads: ""The head of each department may make investigations and prosecute  actions concerning:  ""a) All matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department.   ""b) Violations of any law or rule or order of the department.   ""c) Such other matters as may be provided by law.""  Actually the subpoena was served on Exxon Company, U.S.A., an operating division of Exxon Corporation. But it was Exxon  Corporation that responded to the subpoena.  The court was of the opinion that ""[I]f anything ever was a prime candidate for the application of the doctrine of preemption, this  is it.""  The Attorney General disputes whether the court relied on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act. It is true this is not  completely clear from the record, though the effect of this act was raised by respondents. Whether the court did in fact rely on  this act is, however, immaterial inasmuch as we determine the correctness of the court's decision, not of its reasoning. (E.g.,  Olson v. County of Shasta, 5 Cal.App.3d 336, 343 [85 Cal.Rptr. 77] .) The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has succeeded to the regulatory jurisdiction of the FPC ( 42 U.S.C.A.  Â§ 7172 ). For  convenience we continue to refer to the Federal Power Commission.",
268,"PLGD explains in its appellate brief that it is a subsidiary of Pacific Lighting Corporation, a holding company with a number of  subsidiaries.   ARCO was also served with an investigative subpoena. On June 14, 1976, upon application of ARCO the United States District  Court for the Central District of California issued a temporary restraining order restraining the Attorney General from continuing  his investigation as to ARCO and from enforcing the subpoena served pursuant to the investigation. Following a chain of events  not relevant here, a preliminary injunction issued on September 29, 1977, on the basis of preemption. The Attorney General's  appeal from this order is now pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. All proceedings on the appeal have been  stayed, however, apparently because the district court had indicated that ARCO's motion for summary judgment should be  granted. On June 26, 1978, summary judgment was entered permanently enjoining the Attorney General's investigation.   PG&E was also served with an investigative subpoena. We are informed that in an enforcement action similar to those in this  case the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco (Benson, J.) on November 19, 1976, substantially enforced the  subpoena and denied constitutional challenges, including that of preemption by the Natural Gas Act. The ARCO-PLGD most favored nation clause:  ""The contract gas sales price under regulation shall be negotiated to be the highest of: a) the highest price provided in any other  long-term Prudhoe Bay contract for delivery of substantial volumes of gas to the lower 48 states or b) the highest applicable just  and reasonable rate adopted by the Federal Power Commission or c) the nation-wide area rate in effect in 1975 adjusted for  applicable Alaska taxes and inflation to date of deliveries. Other pricing provisions shall include full BTU adjustment, tax  reimbursement, excess royalty clause, escalation and redetermination clauses and Seller's right to file for special relief.   ""The contract gas sales price absent regulation shall be negotiated to be the highest of: a) commodity value in Buyer's market  less treating and transportation costs to such market, b) any higher price provided in any other long-term Prudhoe Bay contract  for delivery of substantial volumes of gas to the lower 48 states, and c) a negotiated minimum price."" (Emphasis added.)  The Exxon-PG&E provision was:  ""Pursuant to the exercise of the sole and exclusive right to negotiate . . . EXXON and Corporation [P.G.& E.] will negotiate  towards an agreement upon a firm schedule of minimum prices (in cents per MMBtu's) to be not less than the highest price then  provided in any other contract for the sale of Prudhoe Oil Pool gas to be delivered in the lower forty-eight states or the estimated  commodity value of natural gas at the time of first deliveries in the market to be served less applicable costs to the market. . . .  There will also be a provision for redeterminations of a higher price in the event of: A. Regulatory authority adoption of higher",
269,"allowed prices with Corporation [P.G. & E.] to agree to pay to Exxon such higher allowed prices. B. Regulation or de-regulation  such that variable pricing provisions can be used, and one of such variable pricing provisions results in a higher price, in which  event, the higher of the following will apply, such higher prices to be redetermined every six months beginning with the effective  date of such re-regulation or de-regulation. (Specific details of these pricing provisions remain to be negotiated pursuant to the  exercise of the sole and exclusive right to negotiate created in the instrument to which this Exhibit C is attached): 1. The highest  price in the field paid by any U.S. buyer to any seller for significant quantities of gas produced from the North Slope of Alaska to  be delivered in the lower forty-eight states, adjusted for any difference in transportation to a common point, quality, taxes and  excess royalties. 2. The commodity value of natural gas in the market area of the Corporation adjusted for applicable cost to  market."" (Emphasis added.)  The underscored sections are known as three-party most favored nation clauses. (See  FPC v. Sunray DX Oil Co. (1968) 391  U.S. 9, 18, fn. 2 [20 L.Ed.2d 388, 395, 88 S.Ct. 1526] .) The opinion identified several areas of concern. Price-fixing by producers of natural gas, division of the California market,  contracts in restraint of trade, and monopolization of natural gas part of which is to be distributed in California. The court held that the FPC had failed to focus on significant issues arising out of the advance payments program and had  neglected to provide a reasoned and responsive explanation of its decision to continue the program and expand the scope of the  advances eligible for rate base treatment. The record was remanded to the FPC for further proceedings.",
270,"Advance Report Citation: 46 U.S.L.Week 4446.  * Advance Report Citation: 46 U.S.L.Week 4295. HN5 [ ] A ""jurisdictional"" pipeline transports natural gas in interstate commerce and for that reason is subject to FPC  certification jurisdiction. The ""jurisdictional"" label is also sometimes used to apply to sales, in which case it refers to interstate",
271,"sales for resale, which are subject to Commission rate regulation. (  FPC v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., supra, 406 U.S. 621,  626, fn. 1 [32 L.Ed.2d 369, 376-377] .) Similar Commission approval on the basis of public convenience or necessity is required for the abandonment of facilities or  service. ( Â§ 717fb).) ""In 1954 the Supreme Court held, in the now-famous case of  Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin (1954) 347 U.S. 672 [98  L.Ed. 1035, 74 S.Ct. 794]  that the rates of an 'independent producer,' one unaffiliated with but selling to interstate pipelines, were  covered by the Natural Gas Act despite the 'production' exemption, because the producer was engaged in 'sales in interstate  commerce of natural gas for resale.' By including producers, Phillips made possible the complete regulation of distributors'  natural gas prices . . . ."" (Johnson, Producer Rate Regulation in Natural Gas Certification Proceedings: Catco in Context (1962)  62 Colum.L.Rev. 773, 774; see id., for a history of producer rate regulation.)",
272,"These cases also illustrate the rule that ""the general applicability of a state cause of action is not sufficient to exempt it from  pre-emption."" (  Farmer v. Carpenters (1977) 430 U.S. 290, 300 [51 L.Ed.2d 338, 350, 97 S.Ct. 1056] .)  Implied repeal of the antitrust laws is not favored. ""When there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to  both if possible."" (  United States v. Borden Co. (1939) 308 U.S. 188, 198 [84 L.Ed. 181, 190-191, 60 S.Ct. 182] .)  For a discussion of one aspect of competition in the natural gas industry and how procompetitive and regulatory goals interact  see Smith, The Federal Power Commission and Pipeline Markets: How much competition?  ((1969) 68 Colum.L.Rev. 664).",
273,"While it is often said that the federal antitrust laws, complement direct federal regulation (e.g.,  Northern Natural Gas Co. v.  Federal Power Com'n, supra, 399 F.2d 953, 959)  the fact that the Federal Power Commission, though it must consider, is not  bound by the dictates of  antitrust law  (  id., at p. 958 ) along with the fact that Federal Power Commission approval does not  confer antitrust immunity reveals some basic tension.   Oddly enough the Supreme Court has not been called upon to authoritatively decide whether federal antitrust laws have  preemptive effect on state antitrust laws. (See generally Note, The Commerce Clause and State Antitrust Regulation (1961) 61  Colum.L.Rev. 1469.) So far as this court is concerned it is settled that federal  antitrust law  does not preempt parallel state  efforts to control unfair competitive practices. (  Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters, 29 Cal.2d 34, 49-51 [172 P.2d 867] ;  R. E.  Spriggs Co. v. Adolph Coors Co., 37 Cal.App.3d 653, 659  et seq. [ 112 Cal.Rptr. 585] .) (See e.g.,  FPC v.

""Independent producer"" for this purpose means one engaged in the production or gathering of natural gas who sells natural  gas in interstate commerce for resale, but who is not engaged in the transportation of natural gas (other than gathering) by  pipeline in interstate commerce. (18 C.F.R.  Â§ 154.91a) (1977).)  The permissible provisions are defined in 18 Code of Federal Regulations, section 154.93: ""a) Provisions that change a price  in order to reimburse the seller for all or any part of the changes in production, severance, or gathering taxes levied upon the  seller; b) Provisions that change a price to a specific amount at a definite date; b-1) Provisions that permit a change in price to  the applicable just and reasonable area ceiling rate which has been, or which may be, prescribed by the Commission for the  quality of the gas involved; and c) Provisions that, once in five-year contract periods during which there is no provision for a  change in price to a specific amount (paragraph b) of this section), change a price at a definite date by a price-redetermination  based upon and not higher than a producer rate or producer rates which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, are  not in issue in suspension or certificate proceedings, and, are in the area of the price in question . . . .""",
274,"""In the second stage of the decision-making process, an opportunity is provided for Federal officers and agencies, State  governors, other instrumentalities of government, and interested persons to comment on the recommendation and report of the  Federal Power Commission. This device is seen as a means of equipping the President with a full range of information to enable  him to arrive at a determination as to whether to submit a decision to the Congress designating a system for approval and, if so,  to make an intelligent selection of the system to be designated."" (H.R.Rep. No. 94-1658, 2d Sess. (1976) reprinted in 1976 U.S.  Code Cong. & Admin. News, pp. 6643, 6644.)

(Italics added.) The Cartwright Act encompasses sections 16600-16804. 15 United States Code section 13  ( Â§ 1  of the Robinson-Patman Act which amended Â§ 2 of the Clayton Act) consists of six  subdivisions, (a) through (f).  Subdivision (a) prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in price having specified effects on  competition.  Certain affirmative defenses are also permitted, notably cost justification of price differences.  (See, Hills, Antitrust  Adviser (2d ed. 1978) Â§ 4.2, p. 293.)

Section 17040 addresses the concept of locality discrimination: ""It is unlawful for any person engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution or sale of any article or product of general use  or consumption, with intent to destroy the competition of any regular established dealer in such article or product, or to prevent  the competition of any person who in good faith, intends and attempts to become such dealer, to create locality discriminations.

Before the United States Supreme Court's decision in  Nashville Milk Co . a conflict existed in the federal circuits concerning  whether section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act ( 15 U.S.C.

American Oil Company,  (D.C.N.J. 1956) 147 F.Supp. 414 , affd.  per curiam  (3d Cir.)  254 F.2d 816 , cert. den.   358 U.S. 835 [3 L.Ed.2d 72, 79 S.Ct. 58] .)  The Seventh Circuit viewed section 3 as not within the treble damage ambit.  (See, e.g.,  Mackey v. Sears Roebuck & Co. (7th  Cir. 1956) 237 F.2d 869 .) Section 13a  (Â§ 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act) provides: ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to be a party to, or assist in, any  transaction of sale, or contract to sell, which discriminates to his knowledge against competitors of the purchaser, in that, any  discount, rebate, allowance, or advertising service charge is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate,  allowance, or advertising service charge available at the time of such transaction to said competitors in respect of a sale of  goods of like grade, quality, and quantity; to sell, or contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than  those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a  competitor in such part of the United States; or, to sell, or contract to sell, goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of  destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.""

The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action do not run against the City or the Board and are therefore  irrelevant to this appeal.

306,"HN1 [ ] The substantial evidence rule applies to appeal court review of preliminary injunctions. Also the familiar rule requires,  when evaluating the trial court's exercise of discretion in granting a preliminary injunction, that the facts be viewed in the light  most favorable to the order.  (  San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. v. San Diego Congress of Racial Equality, 241 Cal.App.2d 405, 407  [50 Cal.Rptr. 638] .) The North County area has in recent years experienced the immigration of many new residents.  This influx has resulted in an  increased demand for housing.  The current need, coupled with inflationary pressures, has forced many new residents to seek  alternatives to conventional housing.  Thus an expanding market for mobilehomes has been an outgrowth of these forces.   Mobilehome housing, as consumer goods, is comprised of two components: mobilehomes, a moveable commodity, and  mobilehome park space, a right of use of real property.  Within a particular geographical area, these two components are  necessary compliments.",

""Underwritten title company"" is defined therein as ""any corporation engaged in the business of preparing title searches, title  examinations, title reports, certificates or abstracts of title upon the basis of which a title insurer writes title policies."" Insurance Code section 827  requires the issuance of a permit by providing: ""An insurer shall not sell in this state, . . . or offer for  sale, negotiate for the sale of, or take subscriptions for any security of its own issue until it shall have first applied for and  secured from the commissioner a permit authorizing it so to do."" The license requirement is set forth in  Insurance Code section 12389, subdivision (a)(3) , which provides, in part pertinent to the  issue before us: ""Such an underwritten title company shall obtain from the commissioner a license to transact its business.  Such  license shall not be granted until the applicant conforms to the requirements of this section and all other provisions of this code  specifically applicable to applicant.""",
370,"HN1 [ ] This section confers broad investigative powers on the commissioner, enabling the production of evidence ""on any  subject touching insurance business."" Insurance Code section 839  provides:  HN2 [ ] ""The commissioner shall issue a [stock] permit if he finds that: [para. ] (a) The  proposed plan of business of the applicant and the proposed issuance of securities are fair, just, and equitable.  [para. ] (b) The  applicant intends fairly and honestly to transact its business, and [para. ] (c) The securities the applicant proposes to issue and  the methods to be used by it in issuing or disposing of them are such as, in his opinion, will not work a fraud upon the purchaser  thereof, or upon policyholders or other security holders of applicant.  [para. ] Otherwise, he shall deny the application and notify  the applicant in writing of his decision."" Insurance Code section 839.1  provides:  HN3 [ ] ""(a) In any case where a domestic insurer is directly affected by the total  transaction for some part of which the permit applied for is needed, and the commissioner in his discretion determines that  reasonable grounds exist for contentions that such total transaction or any part thereof: [para. ] (1) Is a combination of capital,  skill, or acts to create or carry out restrictions on or to prevent competition in the insurance business; or [para. ] (2) Is a  combination (in the form of a trust or otherwise) in restraint of the insurance business; or [para. ] (3) Is an attempt to monopolize  the insurance business; or [para. ] (4) Is a conspiracy to create any of the foregoing; or [para. ] (5) That such total transaction, or  any part thereof, if consummated will create or result in any of the foregoing or will substantially lessen competition in the  insurance business. [para. ] Then, in such event, the Insurance Commissioner may make findings with respect to whether such  total transaction, or any part thereof, would or would not do or be any of the foregoing.  [para. ] (b) In the event the Insurance  Commissioner makes affirmative findings as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, he may deny the permit applied for.""

Those subsidiaries mentioned were Forest E. Olson, Inc., Landmark Escrow Services, Inc., Certified Mortgage Company, Inc.,  Coldwell Banker Management Corporation and Insurance West Corporation.",
372,"An analogy was found in the sale of credit life and disability insurance, where the demand is ""derived"" in the sense that it  would not exist except for the underlying transaction, and the cost represents a small percentage (one-half of 1 percent) of the  total transaction price.  (See  Credit Ins. Gen. Agents Assn. v. Payne (1976) 16 Cal.3d 651 [128 Cal.Rptr. 881, 547 P.2d 993] .) It was noted that Guardian Title had no intention of offering escrow services, because of the existence of Coldwell Banker's  wholly owned escrow service corporation, Landmark.",
373,"The evidence upon which the department relied in making this finding concerned experience in northern California rather than  any figures relative to market share, market penetration or growth of realtor-owned underwritten title companies in the four  southern California counties in which Guardian Title proposed to operate.  The northern California experience, however, led the  department to conclude that the market share of wholly owned underwritten title companies would be closely aligned to the  share of the market controlled by the parent.",
