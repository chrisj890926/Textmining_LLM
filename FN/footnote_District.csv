48,"Opinion HN1 [ ]   15 U.S.C. Sec. 15  states: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue  therefore in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent,  without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of  suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief under  15 U.S.C. Sec. 26 . The relationship between the plaintiff and defendant has long  since ceased, and injunctive relief is not appropriate here. The cases cited by plaintiff in his pretrial memorandum are inapposite. HN2 [ ]   15 U.S.C. Sec. 1  states in pertinent part:"
49,"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the  several states . . . is declared to be illegal . . . . The plaintiff's complaint also alleges a violation of Sec. 2 of the Sherman Act. Yet, there are no facts stated by plaintiff in any of  the documents before this court which even hint at the existence of a monopoly or the assertion of monopolistic power.  The  court therefore strikes the plaintiff's allegation of a Sec. 2 violation. HN3 [ ]   15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a)  states in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce . . . either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between  different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be  substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent  competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of  either of them . . . . The plaintiff's pre-trial memorandum, filed some three-and-a-half years after his complaint, alleges violations of  15 U.S.C. Secs.  13(c)(d)  &  (e) .  Again, there is nothing in the record to buttress such tardy and conclusory allegations.  The court therefore  strikes the plaintiff's allegations of Secs. 2(c)(d) & (e) violations. HN4 [ ]   28 U.S.C. Sec. 1337  states: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress  regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies. This is actually a renewed motion for summary judgment. Judge Day originally denied the defendant's motion.  This court then  decided it had the power to reconsider the denial and entertain a renewed motion, especially in the light of the decision of the  district court on remand in  Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 270 F. Supp. 754 (N.D. Calif. 1967) . HN5 [ ]  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b)  states in pertinent part: A party against whom a claim . . . is asserted . . . may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary  judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof."

88,"Opinion  The original complaint included as a defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., the national Toyota distributing concern which  imported and distributed automobiles to regional wholesale distributor-franchisees like NET. Toyota Motor Sales, however, was  subsequently removed as a party-defendant on request of counsel.  Although tying arrangements can violate both  Section 1  of the Sherman Act and  Section 3  of the Clayton Act, only the former  statutory provision applies to this case, since the jurisdictional prerequisites for a Clayton Act violation are not present. In  particular, the tied product in this case, delivery services, is not within the Clayton Act's prohibition against ties involving ""goods,  wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities.""  15 U.S.C. Â§ 14 ; See,  Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 9 Cir.  1977, 550 F.2d 1207, 1214 ;  United States v. Jerrold Electronic Corporation, E.D.Pa.1960, 187 F. Supp. 545, 554 , Aff'd per  curiam, 1961,  365 U.S. 567, 81 S. Ct. 755, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806 .   HN2 [ ]  Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 64  requires that a federal court look to the law of the forum state for any provisional remedies to  secure a final judgment: At the commencement of and during the course of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of person or property for the  purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action are available under the circumstances and  in the manner provided by the law of the state in which the district court is held, existing at the time the remedy is sought . . . ."
90,"Of course, the seven million dollar attachment includes property that is also covered by the motion for a preliminary injunction.  The overlap should not be counted twice, since attachment alone constitutes a sufficient property deprivation to trigger due  process requirements. In addition, because NET no longer distributes Toyota automobiles in New England, it may be that NET's  stock has no value apart from the value of the company's assets. If so, the stock would add nothing to the total value of the  property plaintiffs wish to encumber. On the other hand, NET's stock may be worth more than the attachment amount of $  5,000,000 or even more than likely damages of $ 12,000,000. At this point, we lack sufficient information to make these  determinations."
94,"Prior to 1972, NET itself had subcontracted the delivery function to independent common carriers.  This trend appears to be most marked in those opinions which analyze justifications as affirmative defenses; however, their  teachings apply with equal force to the single product issue."
97,"In oral argument, defendants contended that the dealers suffered no injury at all because they passed on any overcharges to  consumers. In general defendants who are direct purchasers cannot make use of a pass-on theory to defend against a private  antitrust damages action.   Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 1977, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 ;  Hanover Shoe, Inc. v.  United Shoe Machinery Corp., 1968, 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 . Nor is it likely that this case falls within  any exception to the Hanover Shoe doctrine, if any exists. See,  Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at 743-45, 97 S. Ct. 2061 ."
99,"Even if proof of individual coercion were an element of a tying violation, it appears from an examination of the affidavit  evidence that there is a reasonable likelihood that plaintiffs would prevail on this issue. Only in 1972 did NET switch from hiring  independent common carriers to using its own transportation facilities. Dealers who voluntarily accepted centralized delivery with  the use of independent contractors could not also be deemed to have agreed to delivery by NET itself. The switch-over appears  to have been a unilateral NET decision pursuant to the general terms of the standard dealer franchise agreement reserving the  seller's right to control delivery. Dealers were not allowed to negotiate this new arrangement; they could either accept it or risk  termination of their franchise. See, Toyota Dealer Sales and Service Agreement, Article XIII, P B(3) (most recent agreement)  (Pltff's Ex. 1 to 5/10/76 Anderson Dep). Considering the large investment of each dealer in his ongoing business and the fact  that no dealer could purchase Toyotas from another distributor, the latter alternative was hardly a realistic one. NET, therefore,  exercised its power in the tying product market, its economically powerful position vis a vis its dealers, to coerce compliance with  the new delivery system. Cf.,  F. T. C. v. Texaco, 1968, 393 U.S. 223, 226-29, 89 S. Ct. 429, 21 L. Ed. 2d 394 .  We have considered the results of the informal survey conducted by Ronald A. Joseph, President of NET, in December 1976,  just prior to commencement of this litigation. 1/6/77 Affidavit of R. A. Joseph. The survey purports to indicate that 22 of 75  dealers did not object to the NET delivery scheme. We attach little weight to this highly informal, self-serving study."

(CCH) P63,065 Core Terms Opinion  This requested award appears to have mistakenly omitted some 126.00 hours of billable time.  The sum of the categories of  time spent in Appendix C-3 to the ""Memorandum of Harold Brown In Support of the Petition For Fees and Costs"" exceeds the  sum of the hours attributed to each of the three named attorneys by that figure. Because I have determined this discrepancy to  have been the result of a mathematical error and, moreover, because the position of the objectors to the application would not  be materially affected or altered by an increase in the number of hours billed by petitioners, I will consider the application as  correctly requesting an award which would encompass the additional 126.00 hours."
112,"From this total award petitioners will, of course, reimburse to class members monies which had been advanced in the form of  retainers ($ 58,400.00) or expenses ($ 6,778.86).    15 U.S.C. Â§ 15  provides: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue  therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides . . .  without respect to the amount  in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's  fees.  The compromise settlement reached in this case included, in addition to contractual changes in the franchise agreements, a  fund of $ 900,000.00."
113,"The Court notes that in many instances, Mr. Brown has attributed a great deal of hours to single dates.  Specifically, on  November 27, 1973 he assigned 62.00 hours; on April 12, 1974, 87.00 hours are charged; 28.00 hours are billed for May 30,  1974 and, on January 13, 1975, 30.00 hours are listed.  Obviously, the times charged must represent the total number of hours  put in over several days.  Therefore, while this type of billing is somewhat of a hindrance to the Court, the hours will not be  rejected as having insufficient documentation.  The remaining 4.20 hours of non-compensated time is comprised as follows: 1) 3.00 hours of the 4.00 hours charged on  November 18, 1974 for studying issues of moving for a separate trial of liability and damages.  Since this case ended in  settlement, the fund was not benefitted by these hours.  2) On June 24, 1974 Mr. Brown charged 2.00 hours for studying this  Court's two-page order adopting the Magistrate's recommendation concerning discovery motions 1.00 is clearly sufficient.  3)  Finally, the remaining .20 hour was disallowed because Mr. Brown sought to be compensated for reserving a room at a hotel on  October 16, 1978."
115,See Appendix A-1 (Economic Expert's Final Report).
116,"Petitioners' figures with respect to hours worked by Stadfeld and Pease differ somewhat from the findings made by this Court.   The information contained in the diary of time records (Appendix C-1) as well as the categorized graph extrapolated therefrom  (Appendix C-2) were of little assistance to the Court in this regard.  See Appendix to this Memorandum for computational analysis.  This amount does not include compensation for 25.00 hours of ""Post Settlement Activity"" due to the nebulous nature of this  particular category and due also to the fact that the lodestar encompasses a total of 254.00 hours for ""Settlement Promotion""  and ""Settlement Procedures."" See Appendix.  Furthermore, the 49.80 hours billed for work done in preparation of the fee application has not been factored in because that  time benefitted only the petitioners and not the class fund.  See  Lindy II, supra, 540 F.2d at 111 . Petitioners' contention that the  fee award in  Souza v. Southworth, 564 F.2d 609 (1st Cir. 1977)  controls here is not persuasive.  Souza speaks to compensation  for time spent litigating the fee issue on appeal and is therefore not directly on point with the issue before this Court."

134,"We need not here reiterate the Court of Appeals' comprehensive technical analysis.  See  399 F.2d 373 . Of course, we do not  decide here whether these changes are new or simply non-inventive changes in manufacture.  We need only decide whether the  changes were proposed as amendments by Hughes' patent attorneys with the knowledge that they were new and with a  calculated effort and intent to deceive the Patent Office, or with reckless disregard of their novelty."
138,"We note that Rosenberg was the attorney who was prosecuting the claim at this time.  A Patent Office action had been issued  on March 20, 1953.  Rosenberg responded by an Amendment dated September 16, 1953.  Without waiting for a reply,  Rosenberg filed the ""Supplemental Amendment"" dated March 9, 1954, which contained the ""incriminating"" statements.  We  question if he intended that the supplemental amendment relate back to the September 1953 amendment. If so, it might serve to  explain the ""nine months"" statement since the I.R.E. Bulletin advertising the diode was issued in February, 1953.  As we did earlier in advising that we were not deciding that claims 60 and 61 were non-inventive matter, we again do not  decide that claims 60 and 61 would fail for late filing.  That is not at issue here.  The issue here is whether Hughes, with"

149,"Given my disposition of the Sherman Act claims, I need not reach defendants' argument that no conspiracy may exist when a  union acts ""unilaterally"" with its members and locals.  I note, however, that the Supreme Court had no problem with this issue in  Carroll, and all the cases cited by the defendant relate to corporations and their subdivisions or officers.  In addition, counsel for  the defendants repeatedly stressed at oral argument the independent nature of each local's decision, characterizing the January  9 directive as one of ""policy"", not ""command"".

153,"Opinion  The case had been transferred by the Clerk in April, 1979, to Judge McNaught upon his assuming office; but as transferor  judge we retained jurisdiction of all motions then under advisement.  As grounds for the additional attachment, plaintiffs explained that a leasehold interest which they had sought to attach in the  amount of $ 5,000,000 had been terminated while the motion for attachment was being considered by the court."
154,"Plaintiffs' decision to withdraw the motion for preliminary injunction seems to us well taken.  In its August 1979 memorandum  of decision, which is reported at  475 F. Supp. 973 , the court sua sponte addressed the question of its authority to order a  Rule  65  preliminary injunction as a form of equitable attachment over defendants' stock. The precise issue had not been argued or  briefed by the parties.  At the time, we proposed alternative bases for our power to order the requested form of preliminary  injunction. Each depended on whether we took a narrow or broad view of the phrase, "". . .  and other corresponding or  equivalent remedies"", in  Rule 64  a point apparently not settled under the present state of the law.  See  475 F. Supp. at 977 .  Defendants correctly point out in their recent memorandum, however, that on the question of the scope of state law remedies we  incorrectly distinguished the case of  Daley v. Ort, D.Mass.1951, 98 F. Supp. 151 , which denied a motion for equitable  attachment prior to verdict.  Had we had the occasion to rule now directly on this point, which we would have had if plaintiffs had  not withdrawn their motion for preliminary injunction, we probably would have changed that aspect of our prior decision and  denied the injunction.  Massachusetts law permits equitable attachment in this instance, presented in the form of a preliminary  injunction only in actions founded upon a debt, which this action is not.   Mass.G.L. c. 214, Â§ 3(7) .  See,  H. G. Kilbourne Co. v.  Standard Stamp Affixer Co., 1913, 216 Mass. 118, 103 N.E. 469 ;  Daley v. Ort, supra, at 152 ."
155,"Hence the rule regarding backhaul allowances. See  85 F.T.C. 1174 (1975) . Since the backhaul issue was raised by  defendants' counsel at the hearing on the pending motions, the rule bears restating.  If a seller adopts a uniform delivered  pricing system, its pricing options must be ""(1) uniform, and (2) available to all customers on a non-discriminatory basis.""  85  F.T.C. at 1176 . While the delivered pricing system is in operation, a backhaul allowance to one customer is illegal; a non- discriminatory option offered to all customers to purchase at an alternative f. o. b. price is not.  Thus an improper backhaul  allowance involves selective deviation from a delivered pricing system once it's in place.  It is not the equivalent, as defendants  seem to suggest, of charging a uniform mill or base price for the product and either adding a delivery charge according to the  distance of the purchaser from the plant, or permitting all purchasers to contract independently for delivery.  The quoted opinion clarified an earlier advisory opinion to the General Foods Corporation.  In the course of the clarification the  FTC noted that the legality or illegality of the delivered price system chosen by General Foods was not at issue.  At issue was"
156,"only whether General Foods could follow a delivered price system with respect to one set of purchasers, while it offered freight- related allowances to private carrier customers positioned to take ""dock"" delivery.  85 F.T.C. at 1175 ."
157,"In  ITT Community Development Corp. v. Barton, 5 Cir. 1978, 569 F.2d 1351 , for example, nothing in the Florida law on  garnishment authorized a court to order funds paid into the registry of the court to secure payment before judgment was entered.  We are confused by the citation to  Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., 1946, 330 U.S. 743, 67 S. Ct. 1015, 91 L. Ed.  1219 , upon which defendants have in part based their statutory construction of the Clayton Act. Bruce's Juices construed only  the Robinson-Patman Act.  At issue in that case was whether the plaintiff-buyer should be allowed to seek as a final remedy a  declaration from the court that certain notes could not be collected on by the defendant-seller who was found to have violated  the Robinson-Patman Act.  Such a remedy, in the Court's view, was clearly outside the intended purposes of the Robinson- Patman Act.  The case does not deal either with the Sherman or Clayton Acts, or with the provisional remedy of prejudgment  attachment."

With respect to the antitrust theory, the parties have asked at this point only for a ruling as to the availability of a state  exemption defense under  Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1942) ."

167,"The Arno court noted that a hearing is available to test whether a filed objection meets the statutory criteria i. e., whether the  objector is a church or school actually located within 500 feet of the applicant's premises and whether the objection was  authorized by the objector's governing body. See  Arno, supra, 384 N.E.2d at 1228 . Indeed, the Church's first objection to  Grendel's application was rejected by the CLC for failure to meet the statutory element of due authorization. Arno makes clear, however, that a church or school may object without having to submit to a hearing at which its reasons or  motives are examined or explained. Id. Simply put, under  Â§ 16C  a church or school may exercise its discretion to object for good  reason, bad reason, or no reason at all.  Thus, certification of the issue of legislative intent to the Supreme Judicial Court, as suggested by the Commonwealth, would  be pointless, since such a determination would have no bearing on the effect of the statute's actual operation."
168,"Plaintiff has also assailed  Â§ 16C  as violative of due process because of the lack of a hearing to probe the standards and  motives governing  Â§ 16C  entities' exercise of their veto powers. In view of this court's decision concerning plaintiff's primary due  process claim, it is unnecessary to reach this issue. To the extent that  Â§ 16C  is invalid because it permits private parties to use public power for invalid purposes, those aspects of  Â§  16C  are better discussed in connection with particular allegations made by Grendel's, e.g., its  Establishment Clause  and  antitrust claims, infra."
169,"Zoning regulations also present the potential for bargaining and discretion, and churches may, of course, exercise such  powers along with other property owners subject to such regulations. In zoning, however, the breadth of regulation negates any  finding that the regulation has a primary effect of advancing religion. Here, because  Â§ 16C  defines a narrow class of"
170,"beneficiaries and because churches and their related schools compose such a large part of the protected class, the same  inference of neutrality cannot be drawn. Likewise, a licensing structure in which the local licensing board could consider a church's objection, but would retain the right to  make an independent determination, is distinguishable from this case.  The defendants have cited three lower state court opinions which they claim as precedent upholding the validity of  Â§ 16C .  The first,  Appeal of Rusch, 32 Pa.Cmwlth. 578, 379 A.2d 1375 (1977) , is inapplicable because it involved the exercise of a  licensing board's discretion in rejecting an application for a license near a church. Moreover, no constitutional challenge was  either advanced, considered, or decided in Rusch. The second,  Horne v. Hernando County, 297 So.2d 606 (Fla.App.1974) , is  distinguishable because it upheld a county ordinance flatly banning licenses within 1500 feet of a church or school. The third case cited,  Wiles v. Michigan Liquor Control Comm'n, 59 Mich.App. 321, 229 N.W.2d 434 (1975) , did reject an  Establishment Clause  attack on a statute virtually identical to  Â§ 16C . But it is clear from the opinion in Wiles that the court was  not presented with the specific due process and  Establishment Clause  arguments advanced here. Indeed, Wiles contains only a  short paragraph concluding that the licensing statute did not have the primary effect of advancing religion. Given its conclusory  nature, Wiles is hardly persuasive authority on the issues before this court.  As has been noted, supra, however, that possibility does provide grounds for due process and  Establishment Clause   challenges."

221,"The special venue provision found in  18 U.S.C. Â§ 1965  is not intended to be exclusive, but is intended to liberalize the existing  venue provisions. Therefore,  HN4 [ ] where venue is improper under  Â§ 1965(a) , it is appropriate to inquire whether the action  can be maintained under the general venue statute,  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(b) .

But since almost all of the acts upon which plaintiff's RICO counts are predicated occurred outside of Massachusetts, none of  her RICO claims ""arose"" in this district.  The California Church argues that even if its own business activities here are sufficiently extensive to meet the venue  requirements of  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(c) , venue for the entire action is still improper in this district because the venue requirements  of  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(b)  have not been met with respect to the individual defendants. But the defense of improper venue is  personal to the party to whom it applies, and a resident defendant may not avail himself of a dismissal or transfer due to  improper venue over a nonresident, unless the latter is an indispensable party.

Plaintiff's complaint itself fails to specify which subsection of  Â§ 1962  defendants are alleged to have violated; however, the  memoranda of law filed subsequently have made it clear that she predicates her claim on  Â§ 1962(c) ."
224,"Judge Duffy's opinion in  Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. O'Hearn, supra , is not to the contrary. He rejected as ""specious"" the argument  that a company that had paid allegedly reasonable prices, though ones inflated by bribes and kickbacks, had not suffered an  injury which  Â§ 1964(c)  addresses since it was ""not hurt competitively by the RICO violation."" Ibid. at 248. We subscribe to Judge  Duffy's conclusion that a RICO violation does not depend upon the existence of a competitive injury. Although  antitrust law   proscribes and remedies certain injuries to competition, RICO does not so directly seek to protect competition. As Judge  Churchill observed, ""competitive injuries and racketeering enterprise injuries would frequently overlap, but they are not  necessarily the same.""  Landmark Savings v. Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Co., supra.   Section 1964(c)  does not require a  ""competitive injury"" but rather, in part, a ""racketeering enterprise injury"" and a plaintiff who has experienced commercial harm  resulting from it.  We do not reach defendants' contention that civil liability under  Â§ 1962(c)  and  Â§ 1964(c)  must be preceded by prior criminal  convictions of two criminal acts, except to note that the opposing citations relied on by plaintiff,  United States v.

229,"We do not construe Ballard to hold that, although courts may not examine the truth or falsity of statements of a religious  nature, these statements may be the bases of a fraud action if made in bad faith. The Court in Ballard never addressed that  issue. Rather, it held only that the verity of religious beliefs or doctrines should not be submitted to the jury.  In International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, the Second Circuit held that, absent a showing that no less  restrictive alternative existed which would not have interfered with the Krishna ritual of ""sankirtan"", the practice by which those  devoted to Krishna approach non-members, tell them of their religion's tenets and seek contributions, a regulation restricting  solicitation at a state fair to a booth unconstitutionally interfered with free exercise rights of members of Krishna Consciousness. In  Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, supra , the Supreme Court upheld a similar regulation restricting  solicitation at the Minnesota State Fair as a reasonable time, place and manner restriction on  First Amendment  rights. The Court  reached that decision through a different analysis than that employed by the Second Circuit and one which did not involve an  inquiry regarding whether Krishna Consciousness had religious aspects entitling it to the protection of the  First Amendment .  Judge Kaufman's opinion for the Second Circuit is cited here not for its holding, which the Supreme Court rejected in Heffron, but  for whatever light it sheds on the separate problem regarding the criteria a court uses to determine when the protection of the  Free Exercise clause  is properly invoked."

Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308, 101 S. Ct.  411 (1980) . As pointed out in  Baldrich, supra, 508 F. Supp. at 615, n. 1 , the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure of 1958 were repealed in  1979 by the Rules of Civil Procedure of 1979.  Rule 39.2 was reenacted as Rule 39.2(c) and its text, insofar as pertinent here, is  identical to that of its predecessor.  See, 32 L.P.R.A. App. 111, p. 162 (1980).  This rule is virtually identical to  Fed. R. Civ. Proc.  41(b)  governing involuntary dismissals.  In 1943 it was also known as  Rule 41(b)  of the Rules of Civil Procedure of Puerto Rico,  1943, and such is the reference in the  Bauza  passage reproduced above. In dismissing complaints for failure to comply with discovery orders the trial courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico seem  to enjoy the same discretionary latitude as federal district courts.  Orderly administration of justice in this sense is identical both  in the state and federal systems.  See, e.g.,  Corchado v. Puerto Rico Marine Management, 665 F.2d 410 (1st Cir. 1981)  (circuit  court underscores that dismissals with prejudice for failure to comply with discovery orders will ordinarily be upheld as being  within sound discretion of trial court). See, generally, 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper,  Federal Practice and Procedure , Civil: Sec. 4440, at 362-365 (1981)."
249,"In Puerto Rico it is common practice to refer to all defendants or the defendants in general as ""the party defendant"" (literal  translation).  If a particular defendant or plaintiff is to be singled out then he or she or it (if a corporation) is expressly identified in  the pleadings."
250,"As explained by this court in  Wong v. Key Finance Corporation, 266 F. Supp. 149, 153, 154 (D.P.R. 1967) , the words ""joint"" or  ""jointly"" in English are the equivalent of ""solidaria"" or ""solidariamente"" in Spanish, which in the case of multiple debtors or  guarantors, means that  any  of them are liable for the entire sums owed.  The Code also confers standing on solidary debtors to  ""utilize, against the claim of the creditor, all the exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation and those which are personal  to him"".  Article 1101,  31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 3112 .  Sureties binding themselves jointly (solidarily) with the principal debtor are  treated, according to the Code, as principal solidary debtors subject to the provisions found in Article 1090-1101, 31 L.P.R.A.  Secs. 3101-3112.   Wong, supra , Id. They also had the right to utilize against the claim of Chase, as creditor, all exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation.   Article 1101. The same result would be obtained under the federal  res judicata  principle as the Supreme Court of the United States  indicated in a similar context in  Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210, 99 S. Ct. 970 (1979) . The Court at  page 154 quoting from  Souffront v. Compagnie des Sucreries, 217 U.S. 475, 486-487, 54 L. Ed. 846, 30 S. Ct. 608 , observed  that ""/O/ne who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another to establish and protect his own right or who assists in the  prosecution or defense of an action in aid of some interest of his own . . . is as much bound . . . as he would be if he had been a  party to the record."""
251,"Plaintiffs themselves characterize Nestor's and Gloria's state court counterclaim as permissive.  Though it is not necessary for  us to decide whether such counterclaim is permissive or compulsory for purposes of this opinion, certainly this characterization  shows that plaintiffs were not involuntary defendants hauled into state court against their wishes.  They freely chose their state  forum and must abide by their conduct even if it implies waiver of a federal forum and its protections.  See,  Nash County Board  of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F.2d 484, 492 (4th Cir. 1981) , cert. den.  454 U.S. 878, 70 L. Ed. 2d 188, 102 S. Ct. 359 , reh.  den.  454 U.S. 1117, 102 S. Ct. 692, 70 L. Ed. 2d 654 .

252,"Blanco v. The Capital , 77 P.R.R. 607 (1954) and  Capo v. A. Hartman & Co. , 57 P.R.R. 190 (1940). As  General Foods v. Mass. Dept. of Public Health, supra, 648 F.2d at 785-786  makes clear, in the case of a state court  judgment deciding federal questions, federal courts must refer to state law on  res judicata  to comply with the command of  28  U.S.C. Sec. 1738 . 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1978  provides as follows:"
253,"""Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting in any manner the right of the United States or any other  party to bring an action under any other law of the United States or of any State, including any right which may exist in  addition to specific statutory authority, challenging the legality of any act or practice which may be proscribed by this  chapter.  No regulation or order issued by the Board under this chapter shall in any manner constitute a defense to such  action."" 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1975  provides as follows: ""Any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in section 1972 of this title may sue  therefor in any district court of the United States in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without regard  to the amount in controversy, and shall be entitled to recover three times the amount of the damages sustained by him, and  the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" In so doing, the court adopted Moore's comments on  Connelly v. Balkwill, 174 F. Supp. 49, 11 Ohio Op.2d 289, 83 Ohio L.  Abs. 513 (N.D. Ohio 1959) , aff'd.  279 F.2d 685 (6th Cir. 1960) .

Chemical Construction  Corp., supra."
254,"Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979)  held that retail purchasers can suffer an  ""injury"" to their business or property within the meaning of section 4 of the Clayton Act, which grants a private treble damage  remedy to persons suffering business injury as a consequence of an antitrust violation. Defendants read the  Moitie  decision as signaling the demise of the judicially created doctrine of exclusive federal judicial  jurisdiction in antitrust cases.  See  Nash, supra, 640 F.2d 492, n. 13 . They argue that inasmuch as the Supreme Court acted on  an action removed from state court, if the pleadings, as the court stated, merely reproduced the initial federal antitrust claims  originally filed in the district court, then the state court had no subject matter jurisdiction over the action and the district court  could acquire none on removal.   General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co., 260 U.S. 261, 288, 67 L. Ed. 244, 43 S.  Ct. 106 (1922)  (federal court must dismiss for want of jurisdiction federal antitrust action originally filed in state court and  subsequently removed to the former court).  See also,  Blumenstock Bros. Adv. Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., 252 U.S. 436, 64 L.  Ed. 649, 40 S. Ct. 385 (1920) ;  Freeman v. Machine Co., 319 U.S. 448, 451, 87 L. Ed. 1509, 63 S. Ct. 1146, n. 6 (1943) ;  but see,  Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 389-394, 91 L. Ed. 967, 67 S. Ct. 810 (1947)  (state court is obligated under  supremacy clause , to  enforce private treble damage remedy -- similar to that in antitrust laws -- found in Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as  amended, regardless whether it be considered ""penal"" in nature).  A remand was thus in order and the  res judicata  question  need not have been decided.  A careful review of the  Moitie  Supreme Court decision reveals that indeed the court was aware of  the removal problem, but nevertheless chose to entertain the  res judicata  arguments.   Moitie, supra, 452 U.S. at 397, n. 2 . While defendants' arguments certainly bear weight, we find it unnecessary to reach this issue on the present record.  Whether or  not the state court here had subject matter jurisdiction of the federal claims before this court, is really immaterial in view of the  opportunities available to the plaintiffs to redress any jurisdictional errors within the state court system. We remain unpersuaded that Congress intended to vest federal courts with jurisdiction exclusive of that of state courts to  entertain private treble damage actions under the Tie-in Amendments, especially, under the criteria set forth in  Gulf Offshore  Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 449 U.S. 1033, 66 L. Ed. 2d 494, 101 S. Ct. 607 , to determine whether a congressional grant of federal  jurisdiction displaces state court jurisdiction over the same federal claims:"
255,"1) an explicit statutory directive; 2) an unmistaken implication from legislative history, and 3) a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests. Aside from the fact that in the case of Tie-in Amendments, there is no explicit statutory directive or legislative history permitting  an inference of exclusive jurisdiction -- the contrary is just the situation as embodied in  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1978  -- we fail to perceive  a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and the commercial interests sought to be protected by Congress in the  amendments.  The broad traditional regulatory power of banking by the states, taken into consideration by Congress in enacting  the Tie-in Amendments, certainly makes entertainment of such federal claims by state courts conducive to the enforcement of  federal rights.   Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., supra ;  Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 507-508, 7 L. Ed. 2d  483, 82 S. Ct. 519 (1962)  (concurrent jurisdiction of state courts upheld in actions under Section 301 of the Labor Management  Relations Act). Certainly, the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not foreign to broad antitrust private treble damage  remedies to redress unfair methods of competition of the type pressed by plaintiffs in this court.  See, the Puerto Rico Monopoly  Act, Act No. 77 of June 25, 1964, as amended,  10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 257 et seq. , especially Secs. 259(a) and 262) (Unfair  Methods of Competition and Exclusive Dealing).  The act explicitly vests on the Superior Court of Puerto Rico jurisdiction to  entertain private treble damage suits in  10 L.P.R.A. Sec. 268(a) . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had already held  pro tanto  in the context of a state civil proceedings in  Lovely v.  Laliberte, 498 F.2d 1261, 1263-64 (1st Cir. 1974) , cert. den.  419 U.S. 1038, 42 L. Ed. 2d 316, 95 S. Ct. 526 (1974) . See  Rodriguez v. Baldrich, supra."
256,"There is no question that state court jurisdiction over the federal constitutional and civil rights claim is concurrent with that of  federal courts.  See,  Diaz v. Collazo , 82 JTS 30 (March 10, 1982) and cases cited; see, also,  Lovely v. Laliberte, supra, note 26 . Even if this were a case of exclusive federal judicial jurisdiction, the equities would tend to favor enforcement of traditional  res  judicata  preclusion inasmuch as there is simply no need to assess whether uniform national policy in antitrust enforcement  would be affected given the voluntary conduct of plaintiffs in state court in refusing to comply with state judicial procedure.  If  anything, an interest in uniform and proper administration of justice should prevail, and in this instance, the state court judgment  fosters this interest the same way as any federal judgment in similar circumstances would. As mentioned previously, in arriving at our findings and conclusions, we have relied in part on our familiarity with Puerto Rican  substantive and procedural law.  In any event, as respects civil procedure, the Puerto Rican rules are very similar to and  sometimes identical with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This identity exists in the area of dismissals for failure to comply  with discovery orders. Given the retention of appellate jurisdiction by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, we may not vacate our  prior judgment at this stage of the proceedings.  However, this should not be construed as a rejection or departure from the  views expressed in our original opinion to which we still adhere."

But plaintiff fails to advance any theory under which the Court could find such contracts to be  illegal restraints of trade.  It does not suggest that the contracts with adjusters by themselves restrain trade, nor does it indicate  that such agreements facilitate other types of illegal combinations.  The Court therefore concludes that plaintiff's allegations as to  the illegality of the defendant's agreements with insurance adjusters are without merit."

290,"A threshold objection by defendant to this Court's jurisdiction can be disposed of without extended dicussion.

The defnednat concedes that many of the parts and supplies which plaintiff purchases in the course  of its business come from outside of Rhode Island.  Defendant's Memorandum of Law at 24.  The defendant argues, however,  that the effect of any alleged illegalities is merely to divert business from one body shop to another without affecting the total  volume intrastate business or the total amount of parts and supplies purchased in interstate commerce.  However, if plaintiff is  successful in showing that the provider agreements between Aetna and certain body shops are used to limit the quality of repair  work performed, the requisite effect on interstate commerce could be shown.  This possibility that the defendant's practices as a  matter of practical economics may affect interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy the Sherman Act's jurisdictional requirement.   McLain v.

The  pharmacies in the plan thus received only a $2 markup on all drugs sold to plan members.   Royal Drug at 209 .   Plan members dealing with participating pharmacies had to pay only $2 for any prescription drug.

292,"In D & B Auto Body, Inc. v. Firemen's Fund Insurance Co., Civ.

In response to this invitation to this invitation, the Division submitted an excellent Memorandum of Law  discussing the relevant issues.  D & B Auto Body subsequently was dismissed pursuant to a stipulation by the parties.  The  Court nevertheless found the views of the Antitrust Division quite useful, and will cite them in this Opinion where appropriate.  In  connection with the McCarron-Ferguson immunity issue discussed above, the Court notes that the Justice Department agrees  that the vertical provider agreements at issue do not constitute ""the business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran- Ferguson Act.  Memorandum of the United States at 6-7."
294,"See Plaintiff's Objection and Opposition at 3 and 11.   Monopsony is the economic term used to describe a market involving one buyer and numerous sellers.  It is the counterpart in  the buyer's market of monopoly.   The vertical provider agreements might also have anticompetitive effects if they facilitated the creation of horizontal cartels  between insurance companies or between automobile repair shops.  Workman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.,  520 F. Supp. 610, 615-17 (N.D. Cal. 1981) ; Sausalito Pharmacy, Inc. v. Blue Shield of California, 1981-1 TRADE CASES at  75,609; Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 1980-2 TRADE CASES at 76,696. Likewise, the agreements might  violate the rule of reason if they were used by automobile repair shops as an instrument of predatory pricing.  Sausalito  Pharmacy, Inc. v. Blue Shield of California, supra, at 75,609. There is no contention in this case that automobile repair shops  have attempted to form a horizontal cartel or have engaged in predatory pricing.  Plaintiff's contentions with respect to the  existence of horizontal agreements between insurance companies are discussed in greater detail infra."
295,"The Justice Department takes the position that the vertical agreements in question do not violate the Sherman Act absent a  showing that ""insurance companies have the power to limit the amount of repair work performed for policyholders, that they  refuse to deal with any competent repair shop in the same terms available to other repair shops, or that there are other facts that  would render their actions unreasonably anticompetitive."" Memorandum of the United States at 11.   The Seventh Circuit in this case noted that:  ""When the rate is too low, some repair shops resort to dishonest practices in order to survive.  These practices include: (1)  charging for new parts but using old parts; (2) estimating parts that are not damaged; (3) straightening old parts but charging for  new parts; (4) inflating labor hours; (5) billing for repairs which have not been performed; and (6) offering rebates and bribes to  adjusters."" Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., supra, 1204 n. 6 . The court went on to observe that, ""Although these deplorable practices may be prevalent in the auto repair industry, in and of  themselves they are not matters the antitrust laws were intended to address."" Id.  (emphasis in original).  This Court agrees with  the Seventh Circuit that unethical business practices which do not have a significant adverse effect on competition do not violate  the antitrust laws.  George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 508 F. 2d 547, 560-2 (1st Cir. 1974) , cert. denied,  421 U. S. 1004 (1975) . However, if dishonest business practices are the result of a concerted effort to restrict output, a  significant adverse effect on competition may result, and the Sherman Act's rule of reason may be violated."
296,"Aetna comes very close to demonstrating that it does not attempt to restrict output by limiting the quality of repairs performed  by its preferred shops. Aetna's affidavits state that it recommends shops based on their ability to perform quality repairs at a  competitive price, and that it quarantees that workmanlike repairs can be performed for the amount of its estimate. Daffron  Affidavit at 5; Mistretta Affidavit at 2.  This is circumstantial evidence that Aetna has not conspired with preferred repair shops to  restrict output by performing inferior repairs. Absent an explicit denial that such an agreement exists, however, the Court cannot  say that this is sufficient to meet Aetna's burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact."
297,"Plaintiff appears to rely on the theory of conscious parallelism to prove the existance of a horizontal conspiracy. It claims that  the defendant and other insurance companies employ similar practices in settling claims, such as the use of the same  independent publication to determine repair times and new part prices.  Plaintiff suggests that the existence of these similiar  practices can only be explained as the result of a conspiracy between insurance companies.  The Supreme Court has indicated  that parallel behavior may be circumstantial evidence of the existence of an agreement or conspiracy. See  Interstate Circuit, Inc.  v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 226-27 (1939) . But it is also clear that mere proof of parallel behavior without more does not  prove the existence of a contract, combination or conspiracy.  Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346  U.S. 537, 541 (1954) ;  Naumkeag Theatres Co. v. New England Theatres, Inc., 345 F. 2d 910, 911-12  (1st Cir., cert. denied,  382  U.S. 906 (1965) .  In this case, plaintiff has failed to show that the similar practices employed by automobile insurance companies are anything  more than the result of the companies' independent pursuit of their economic self-interest.  Absent such a showing, the doctrine  of conscious parallelism in no way supports an inference of conspiracy. See  Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co.,  660 F.2d 1195, 1200-01 (7th Cir. 1981) , cert. denied,  102 S. Ct. 1717 (1982) ;  Workman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile  Insurance Co., 520 F. Supp. 610, 621 (N.D.

The Court therefore need not dedcide whether an agreement between insurance companies to fix the price of automobile  repairs would be immune under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.   Such a claim would clearly be a challenge to ""the business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson  exemption."
298,"Plaintiff appears to argue that even if the agreements between Aetna and its insureds are themselves immune under the  McCarran-Ferguson Act, the anticompetitive effects of such agreements are not.  Objection and Opposition at 11-12.  This  argument is completely without merit.  As the Justice Department points out, ""An antitrust exemption would be meaningless,  however, if it were forfeited to the extent that the exempted conduct produced anticompetitive effects."" Memorandum of the  United States at 14.  See  Royal Drug at 249  (Brennan, J. dissenting).  If the agreements satisfy the requirements of the  McCarran-Ferguson Act, they are exempt from the antitrust laws without regard to their possible anticompetitive effects.   In addition, under the McCarren-Ferguson Act the antitrust laws remain applicable to acts of boycott, coercion and intimidation  in the business of insurance.  15 U.S.C.  Â§ 1013(b) .  The Court concludes for the reasons set forth in a subsequent section of this  opinion that the actions of defendant and its insureds cannot be said to constitute an act of boycott or coercion.  See pp. 30-34  infra."
299,"To trigger McCarran-Ferguson exemption, the system of state regulation need not completely duplicate the provisions of the  federal antitrust laws. The Court agrees with the Second Circuit's observations that:  ""The McCarran-Ferguson Act clearly contemplates that where a state undertakes to regulate the business of insurance, it has  the power to permit practices which would otherwise violate federal antitrust laws; if the exemption is only to apply when state  law squarely prohibits all acts which would, absent the exemption, violate the antitrust laws, the state regulation which the  McCarran-Ferguson Act aims to foster,  15 U.S.C.  Â§Â§ 1011 ,  1012(a) , would be a nullity."" Dexter v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States, 527 F. 2d 233, 236 (2d Cir. 1975) ; accord  Travelers Ins. Co. v.  Blue Cross of Western Pa., 481 F. 2d 80, 83 n. 10  (3rd Cir.); cert. denied,  414 U.S. 1093 (1973) ;  Ohio AFL-CIO v. Insurance  Rating Bd., 451 F. 2d 1178, 1181 (6th Cir. 1971) , cert. denied,  409 U. S. 917 (1972) .  The Justice Department takes the position that a combination between insurers and insureds which aggregates buying power  would not violate the antitrust laws in any case, absent some showing that insureds had agreed to pool their purchasing power  and restrict demand so as to lower the price of automobile repairs below the competitive level.  Memorandum of the United  States at 16.It seems at least unlikely that plaintiff could make such a showing at trial.  Because defendant is entitled to  summary judgment on McCarran-Ferguson grounds, however, the Court need not decide if defendant has met its burden of  showing that no genuine issue of fact exists as to this possible anticompetitive effect of the insurer-insured combination."
302,"Defendant in its Memorandum of Law cites the deposition of Richard Ruggiero, the plaintiff's president, in support if its position  that Fortin's statement was made without malice.  The Court has read the cited portion of the deposition and finds therein no  discussion whatsoever of the question of malice."
303,"Cia. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Avis Rental Car Corp. Reporter 576 F. Supp. 1011 *; 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11185 **; 1984-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P65,940 Core Terms Opinion Section 3 of the Clayton Act,  15 U.S.C. Sec. 14 (1976) , provides in pertinent part:"
304,"It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce . . . to lease or make a sale . . . of goods, wares, merchandise,  machinery, supplies, or other commodities . . . for use, consumption, or resale . . . on the condition, agreement, or  understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, the  goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor . . . of the lessor or seller, where the  effect (thereof) . . . may be to substantially lessen competition . . . Section 1  of the Sherman Act,  15 U.S.C. Sec. 1 , prohibits contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade. Mr. Felipe M. Lopez is a director, Vice President and Treasurer, as well as a shareholder, of Caribe.  In addition, he is the  officer primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company.  Lopez Deposition at 6, 8-9, 15."
305,"A copy of the standard rental agreement between Mr. Lopez and Avis was made an exhibit to the transcript of his deposition.  Lopez Deposition at 5;  Id.  Exhibit 1. A customer of Hertz or National also pays for gasoline only if the car rented is returned with less gas then when picked up.   Affidavit of Alberto Roque, (""Hertz Affidavit""), paragraph 4; Affidavit of Miguel A. Marrero (""National Affidavit"") paragraph 5. The  current provision of Avis' standard rental agreement pertaining to gasoline charges has been used by Avis since July 1977.  Avis  Affidavit, paragraph 4.  Hertz and National have used similar provisions at all times relevant to this action.  Hertz Affidavit,  paragraph 3; National Affidavit, paragraph 5."
307,"Mr. Felipe Lopez, Vice-President of Caribe, testified to his personal experience in renting a car from defendant Avis.  He  conceded that he was at no time told that he must buy gasoline from Avis; rather, he expressly acknowledged that the  defendants permit their customers to buy gasoline from any source, and do not force them to purchase it from the car rental  company.  Lopez Deposition at 93. This practice is based on market research indicating that car rental customers prefer to rent cars with a full tank of gasoline.  See, e.g. , Avis Affidavit para. 6; National Affidavit para. 6; Hertz Affidavit para. 5.  There may also be other business reasons for  such a practice.  Uniformity in the amount of gasoline in cars available for rental prevents unnecessary administrative expense  for the rental company.  For practical reasons, a full tank is the easiest to administer.  The Court finds these business  considerations far outweigh any anti-trust concerns the plaintiff has asserted. Affidavit of Felipe M. Lopez, para. 5.  The only other affidavit to address this issue simply incorporates the statements of Mr.  Lopez, and is entitled to no independent evidentiary weight.   See  Affidavit of C. Lopez-Pena, para. 2. The Court has reviewed Caribe's request for additional discovery to obtain facts in support of its claim.  In light of the plaintiff's  concessions during deposition testimony and the facts submitted by the defendants, the Court finds that no issue of material fact  concerning the alleged tie-in can be raised thereby.  Plaintiff's request, accordingly, is denied.   First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v.  Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968) ;  O. Hodgkins Sales Corp. v.
