Accordingly, we reverse. From this country's beginning there has been an abiding and widespread fear of the evils which flow from monopoly  -- that is the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few.  On the basis of this fear, Congress in 1890,  when many of the Nation's industries   [***559]   were already concentrated into what it deemed too few hands,  passed the Sherman Act in an attempt to prevent further concentration and to preserve competition among a large  number of sellers.  Several years later, in 1897, this Court emphasized this policy of the Sherman Act by calling  attention to the tendency of powerful business combinations to restrain competition ""by driving out of business the"

After evidence had been taken on the issue, Judge Goodrich, sitting by designation, ruled that when Hanover had been  forced to pay excessive prices for machinery leased from United, it had suffered a legal injury: ""This excessive price is the"

570,"1  Topco, which is referred to at times in this opinion as the ""association,"" is actually composed of 23 chains of supermarket"
571,"2  In addition to purchasing various items for its members, Topco performs other related functions:  e. g ., it insures that there is  adequate quality control on the products that it purchases; it assists members in developing specifications on certain types of  products ( e. g ., equipment and supplies); and it also aids the members in purchasing goods through other sources. 405 U.S. 596, *596; 92 S. Ct. 1126, **1126; 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, ***515; 1972 U.S. LEXIS 167, ****2; 173 U.S.P.Q.  (BNA) 193, *****193 Page 8 of 19    [****6]   All of the stock in Topco is owned by the members, with the common stock, the only stock having voting  rights, being equally distributed.  The board of directors, which controls the operation of the association, is drawn  from the members and is normally composed   [194]   of high-ranking executive officers of member chains. It is the  board that elects the association's officers and appoints   [*599]   committee members, and it is from the board that  the principal executive officers of Topco must be drawn.  Restrictions on the alienation of stock and the procedure  for selecting all important officials of the association from within the ranks of its members give the members  complete and unfettered control over the operations of the association. Topco was founded in the 1940's by a group of small, local grocery chains, independently owned and operated, that  desired to cooperate to obtain high quality merchandise under private labels in order to compete   [***521]   more  effectively with larger national and regional chains.  3  [****8]   With a line of canned, dairy, and other products, the   [*600]   association began.  It added frozen foods in 1950, fresh produce in 1958, more general merchandise  equipment  [****7]   and supplies in 1960, and a branded bacon and carcass beef selection program in 1966.  By  1964, Topco's members had combined retail sales of more than $ 2   [**1130]   billion; by 1967, their sales totaled  more than $ 2.3 billion, a figure exceeded by only three national grocery chains.  4 Members of the association vary in the degree of market share that they possess in their respective areas.  The  range is from 1.5% to 16%, with the average being approximately 6%.  While it is difficult to compare these figures  with the market shares of larger regional and national chains because of the absence in the record of accurate  statistics for these chains, there is much evidence in the record that Topco members are frequently in as strong a  competitive position in their respective areas as any other chain. The strength of this competitive position is due, in  some measure, to the success of Topco-brand products.  Although only 10% of the total goods sold by Topco  members bear the association's brand names, the profit on these goods is substantial and their very existence has  improved the competitive potential of Topco members with respect to other large and powerful chains. It is apparent that from meager beginnings approximately a quarter of a century ago, Topco has developed into a  purchasing association wholly owned and operated  [****9]   by member chains, which possess much economic  muscle, individually as well as cooperatively. II Section 1  of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part: HN1"

Moreover, there already were such significant obstacles to pure competition in the industry that  a court must compare the prices that obtain under the maximum-fee arrangements with those that would otherwise prevail rather  than with those that would prevail under ideal competitive conditions.

And in this unusual case, where flour is  monopolized  [****67]   and sugar is useful only when   [*40]   used with flour, consumers will suffer no further  economic injury by the monopolization of the sugar market.

When the economic advantages of joint packaging are substantial the package is not appropriately  viewed as two products, and that should be the end of the tying inquiry.

[****69]   These three conditions -- market power in the tying product, a substantial threat of market power in the  tied product, and a coherent economic basis for treating the products as distinct -- are only threshold requirements.   Under the rule of reason a tie-in may prove acceptable even when all three are met.

Even if the lack of procedural protections does not justify a conclusive  presumption of predominantly anticompetitive effect, the mere act of expulsion of a competitor from a wholesale  cooperative might be argued to be sufficiently likely to have such effects under   [*291]   the present circumstances  and therefore to justify application of the   [****14]    per se  rule.

If, however, the ARCO stations reduce their price by a penny or two, they  might divert enough business from USA stations to force them gradually to withdraw from the market.  2  [****38]    The fixed price would be lower than the price that would obtain in a free market, but not so low as to be ""predatory"""
