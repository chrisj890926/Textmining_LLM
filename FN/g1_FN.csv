] ""'Conscious parallelism' describes conduct by rivals in an industry who 'coordinate their conduct simply by observing 
and reacting to the moves of their competitors.' Stephens v. CMG Health, 96 Civ. 7798, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23797, at *18 
n.12 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 1997) (citation omitted). "
33,4," While defendants may contest the reliability of the evidence utilized by plaintiffs' experts to make conclusions as to pricing, and 
offer evidence of ""variation in average earning by commission rates among Defendants,"" (Daniel S. Levy, Ph.D., at 7), the task 
of weighing the competing evidence is the role of the jury. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. "
34,5," Asher noted that he had incomplete financial data productions from a few defendants, and intended to ""supplement [his] 
presentation with respect to the defendants from whom more complete computerized data may be required and may hereafter 
be obtained."" Asher, 12/15/03, at 7 fn 9. This ""intention"" resulted in an Order to Show Cause by several of these defendants, 
aimed at blocking plaintiffs' ability to supplement the record. Shortly thereafter, the parties amicably resolved their dispute 
without the need for a hearing. Although plaintiffs again raise questions, in supplemental submissions, requested by the Court, 
about the adequacy of certain defendants' productions, and defendants again hotly contest any deficiencies, plaintiffs and 
defendants agree that their dispute should not affect the timing of the summary judgment decision. Therefore, although unaware 
of the substance of plaintiffs' and defendants' discussions and resolutions concerning productions, the Court will proceed under 
the assumption that these percentages apply to all defendants. "
35,6," Defendants expend considerable time and effort arguing that plaintiffs are barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine from 
introducing evidence of defendants' alleged evasion of Article 11. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, however, does not protect 
conspiracies so defendants may evade the law, but rather, conspiracies so defendants may change the law. See Eastern 
Railroad Presidents Conference, et al. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136-37, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961) 
(""We think it equally clear that the Sherman Act does not prohibit two or more persons from associating together in an attempt to 
persuade the legislature or the executive to take particular action with respect to a law that would produce a restraint or a 
monopoly. Although such associations could perhaps, through a process of expansive construction, be brought within the 
general proscription of 'combination[s] … in restraint of trade,' they bear very little if any resemblance to the combinations 
normally held violative of the Sherman Act, combinations ordinarily characterized by an express or implied agreement or 
understanding that the participants will jointly give up their trade freedom, or help one another to take away the trade freedom of 
others through the use of such devices as price-fixing agreements, boycotts, market-division agreements, and other similar 
arrangements."") (emphasis added), citing 15 U.S.C. § 1; United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 14 L. Ed. 2d 
626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965) (citing to Noerr and stating that ""joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust 
laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct is not illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader 
scheme itself violative of the Sherman Act.""). To the extent that plaintiffs have any intention of introducing evidence of 
defendants' joint efforts to ""seek legislation"" by, for example, lobbying to amend or revoke Article 11, which this Court has no 
reason to believe they do, such evidence will be barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. In other words, while any efforts that 
defendants undertook to influence the DCA are protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, defendants' joint efforts to avoid the 
DCA's enforcement are not shielded."
35,7," Ford asserts that it altered its business structure in the mid-1960's but did not formalize the change with the DCA until 1971. Pl. 
Opp. at 12."
35,8," Although the parties dispute whether defendants are employment agencies (subject to Article 11) or management agencies 
(permitted to exceed the ten percent cap), this Court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate this substantive disagreement. See 
Masters, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 698, at *29-32 (the statute's legislative scheme provides for exclusive enforcement (in New York 
City) by the Department of Consumer Affairs (""DCA"")). Though not controlling, it is interesting to note that on April 11, 2003, after 
this Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether defendants were in violation of Article 11, the DCA determined that 
""… we are unpersuaded by your [plaintiffs'] contention that model management companies … meet the New York General 
Business Law (""GBL"") § 171 definition of an 'employment agency.' Instead, every indication is that these types of companies fall 
under the theatrical managers exception of GBL § 171(8). This is because they are primarily career managers and only 
'incidentally' do job placements for their clients."" After plaintiffs proffered additional evidence,, the DCA concluded that ""… we 
remain unconvinced that model management companies do not fall within the managers exception to the employment agency 
licensing law in § 171(8)."" Def. Reply at 2."
35,9," Ford was a member of IMMA from October 1974 through December 2003, Wilhelmina from the early 1970's through December 
2003, Elite from 1979 through November 1993, Next from April 1990 through September 1994 and again from March 1996 
through April 1997, IMG from in or about 1980 through December 2003, Click from April or May 1994 through December 2003, 
and Images from 1982 through December 2003. "
36,10," Quite notably, Elite's suit alleged (almost identically to plaintiffs' current action) that Ford, Wilhelmina, and other IMMA 
members ""had agreed to increase their rates and adopt a uniform price structure and circumvent the licensing requirements of 
the New York General Business Law."" Pl. Opp. at 15, citing Pl. Exhs. 7-10 (Court Documents). John Casablancas, Elite's 
founder, was even quoted as stating that he was contemplating an antitrust class action on behalf of the models. It appears that 
Elite abandoned the action, and instead joined IMMA."
36,11," Whether Casablancas learned about the other defendants' pricing practices from clients or from discussions with defendants 
will be for the jury to decide. "
37,12," Pillard's testimony that she ""decided it was best not to show the letter"" (Pl. Exh. 288 (Pillard Dep.) at 61:8-62:2) at best, 
creates an issue of fact as to whether Pillard did in fact follow Casablancas' instructions. "
38,13," Defendants rightly assert that form contracts are efficiency-enhancing tools that do not violate antitrust law when the use of 
the form contract is voluntary and the rate or fee is left blank. See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Division, Business Review 
Letter 02-7 (Nov. 15, 2002). "
39,14," Defendants argue that plaintiffs, in opposing summary judgment, may not rely on internal Elite memoranda, summarizing 
IMMA meetings, which have yet to be authenticated, as the non-movant may only rely on ""such facts as would be admissible in 
evidence."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). While defendants are correct as to Rule 56(e)'s requirement on admissibility, I have no reason 
to believe that these memoranda are inherently inadmissible, and instead find, based on the arguments presented at this stage, 
that plaintiffs may, for example, authenticate these documents as business records pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence (""Fed. 
R. Evid."") 803(6). "
40,15," Notably, at an IMMA meeting on January 21, 1980, ""all members were very much in favor of instituting"" ""an agreement among 
ourselves whereas any model debt will be honored by any agency in the event the model should switch agencies."" Pl. Exh. 14 at 
EL 04086-04087. ""John mentioned the procedure at Elite wherby [sic] all models sign a letter to this effect …"" Id. at EL 04086."
40,16," I find plaintiffs' reliance on Fed. R. Evid. 404, as the basis for which to allow evidence of collateral agreements to establish a 
conspiracy on models' commissions, to be inapposite. Rule 404, as an evidentiary rule, pertains to the admissibility of evidence, 
not to the sufficiency of evidence on a summary judgment motion in an antitrust case."
40,17," See In re Citric Acid Litig., 191 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir. 1999)(""Gathering information about pricing and competition in the 
industry is standard fare for trade associations. If we allowed conspiracy to be inferred from such activities alone, we would have 
to allow an inference of conspiracy whenever a trade association took almost any action. As the Supreme Court has recognized, 
however, trade associations often serve legitimate functions, such as providing information to industry members, conducting 
research to further the goals of the industry, and promoting demand for products and services.""), citing Maple Flooring Mfrs. "

burden of demonstrating withdrawal lies on the defendant. See United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d 107, 118 (2d Cir. 2000); 
James, 609 F.2d at 41; Borelli, 336 F.2d at 388. Whether a defendant withdrew from a conspiracy is often a question of fact for 
the jury, see, e.g., Panebianco, 543 F.2d at 454 n.5; Borelli, 336 F.2d at 390; however, when the material facts are not disputed, 
courts have decided the issue as a matter of law, see, e.g., United States v. Goldberg, 401 F.2d 644, 648-49 (2d Cir. 1968);

summary judgment for an individual dealer), citing 15 U.S.C. § 15c)), G. Ford may be held liable in his representative capacity. 
Notwithstanding G. Ford's assertions to the contrary (G. Ford Decl. PP 22, 37), the evidence discussed supra, in addition to G. 
Ford's concession that ""only liars like competition"" (Pl. Exh. 283 at 138:10-15), allows for a reasonable inference that G. Ford

of models' employment is admissible as probative of an agreement on models' commissions. "
55,1," The ""sell-through"" market refers to videos and DVDs that are sold to customers of the retail outlets, as opposed to rented."
55,2," Valley is not a defendant in this case. Plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that Ingram is in the process of purchasing 
Valley. Am. Compl. P 31. "
56,3," Presumably plaintiffs are referring to Valley's presence in the video and DVD rental market, as they have alleged that Valley 
has the exclusive right to market Universal films in the ""sell-through"" market. Am. Compl. P 71. "
59,4," The Court does not readPepsiCo to require that a group boycott be exclusively horizontal in nature for the per se rule to apply. 
This interpretation would call into doubt several seminal group boycott cases, cited by plaintiffs, which applied the per se rule to 
boycotts involving parties on different levels of the distribution chain. See, e.g., United States v. General Motors, 384 U.S. 127, 
86 S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966); Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 
(1959). Rather, the Court reads PepsiCo to stand for the proposition that the boycott must originate among the horizontal 
competitors. To the extent that the defendants are arguing the former interpretation, the Court rejects that position. "
61,5," ""Cross-elasticity of demand"" refers to ""the extent to which consumers will change their consumption of one product in response 
to a price change in another."" PepsiCo. Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., Inc., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIs 13440, No. 98 Civ. 3282, 1998 WL 
547088, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 1998) (quoting Eastman Kodak v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 469, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 
119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992)). "
62,6," Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 83 S. Ct. 97, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1962) is misplaced. Although the 
Loew's Court affirmed that a copyrighted film is entitled to a presumption of uniqueness, that case focused on whether a court 
could infer the presence of market power from ownership of a particular copyright in analyzing the legality of ""block-booking"" 
practices -- a form of tying arrangement. See id. at 48-50. The case contains no general discussion of whether each film 
constitutes its own market. Hence, the Court sees no direct support in Loew's for plaintiffs' position."
62,7," Moreover, it is worth noting that, although Universal markets its movies directly to major retail chains such as Blockbuster and 
Hollywood Video, see Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp. at 21, there is no indication that Universal would sell its films directly to smaller 
retail outlets if it were approached. Indeed, it seems likely that the reason Universal employs a dual distribution system is so that 
marketing to smaller retailers, and the considerable time and effort that it takes, may be handled by intermediate distributors who 
have built up business relationships and networks with these smaller shops. "
63,8," Defendants cite PepsiCo in support of their position, asserting that the court held that distribution of fountain-dispensed soft 
drinks by independent foodservice distributors was not a relevant market. However, defendants cite the court's decision 
concerning Coca-Cola's summary judgment motion. See PepsiCo, 114 F. Supp. 2d at 247-58. At that point, the court had before 
it sufficient evidence, elicited through discovery, to be able to evaluate the alleged relevant market and determine whether it 
was, indeed, viable. By contrast, at the motion to dismiss stage, the court felt unable to hold that the market was inadequately 
alleged. See PepsiCo, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13440, 1998 WL 547088, at *12. "
65,9," Plaintiffs' argument that Universal can be considered a monopolist because it controls 100% of Universal products is meritless. 
As the Fifth Circuit has stated, ""obviously, every manufacturer has a natural monopoly over the distribution of its products. That 
monopoly, however, does not contravene the antitrust laws."" Riddell, 673 F.2d at 791 (citing United States v. E.I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)). Moreover, as previously explained, the relevant market in 
this case is not Universal products; it is ""the wholesale distribution market for 'sell-through' and rental movie videos and DVDs in 
the United States."" Am. Compl. P 22. "
66,10," HN21[
] Primary line price discrimination occurs where the seller's price discrimination harms other sellers. Secondary-line 
price discrimination occurs where the seller's price discrimination harms competition among the seller's customers - in this case, 
the wholesale distributors. See George Haug Co. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars, Inc., 148 F.3d 136, 141 n.2 (2d Cir. 1998) "
67,11," But see FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822, 44 F.T.C. 1499 (1948) (holding that quantity 
discounts that appear on the face of things to be ""available"" to all buyers may not functionally be available to many smaller 
buyers). Flash and FTD are arguably ""smaller buyers"" in comparison to Ingram and VPD, who according to plaintiffs' complaint, 
control approximately 50% and 25% of the market for wholesale distribution of video rentals. Amend. Comp. PP 27-28. "
68,12," Defendants also raise a series of other objections to plaintiffs'2(f) claim. First, they allege that plaintiffs do not mention them 
specifically by name in their allegations, instead referring to ""wholesale distributors"" and ""plaintiffs' competitors."" While it is true 
that plaintiffs do not refer to defendants by name in each of their allegations, plaintiffs do refer to them frequently enough 
throughout the section that a reader, especially a reader who was drawing inferences in favor of the plaintiff, could easily 
understand the defendants to be the subjects of the claims. Moreover, in plaintiffs' 2(f) allegation in P 146, Ingram and VPD are 
mentioned specifically by name. Next, defendants allege that plaintiffs cannot raise a § 2(f) claim on the basis of a violation of § 2(d) or § 2(e). While courts are 
split on whether a § 2(f) claim can be derived from §§ 2(d)-(e) violations (see Murdoch, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20878, 2001 WL 
1607039 (S.D.N.Y.2001); but see Intimate Bookshop, 88 F. Supp.2d 133 (S.D.N.Y.2000)), such a charge is mooted by the fact 
that plaintiffs' have also successfully raised a § 2(a) claim, from which a § 2(f) claim can indisputably be derived. "
69,," Lastly, defendants assert that plaintiffs have not alleged that the purported price differentials granted to Ingram and VPD were 
not justified by Universal's need to meet the price of its competitors. While ""meeting the competition's price"" is admittedly an 
affirmative defense for sellers under §§ 2(a), (d)and (e), it is irrelevant to a buyer's defense under § 2(f) and particularly irrelevant 
at the motion to dismiss stage. "
71,13," The requirement stated in defendant Universal's brief that a plaintiff must prove that defendant acted with ""exclusively 
malicious motivation"" in procuring the breach of contract was implicitly overruled by the 1996 Guard-Life decision. While 
defendants cite a 1997 case in support of this proposition, Elliott Assocs., L.P. v. Republic of Panama, 975 F. Supp. 332, 341 
(S.D.N.Y. 1997), a closer examination of that case reveals that it only cites pre-1996 cases to support this notion. (e.g. Wegman 
v. Dairylea Coop., Inc., 50 A.D.2d 108, 376 N.Y.S.2d 728, 736 (4th Dep't 1975); Sadowy v. Sony Corp. of America, 496 F. Supp. 
1071, 1080 (S.D.N.Y.1980); Ultramar Energy Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 179 A.D.2d 592, 579 N.Y.S.2d 353, 354 (1st 
Dep't 1992); Benjamin Goldstein Productions, Ltd. v. Fish, 198 A.D.2d 137, 603 N.Y.S.2d 849, 851 (1st Dep't 1993). As a result, 
Elliot states the wrong proposition of law. The correct standard is stated above. "
76,1," While Defendants M. Weingold & Company and Jack Weingold (collectively ""Weingold"") and Harry Rock & Associates, Inc. 
(""Rock""), also initially opposed the Motion for Class Certification, they have informed the Court that they have withdrawn that 
opposition and, in fact, intend to join Plaintiffs in seeking approval of a class-wide settlement of claims against Weingold and 
Rock. While the DeMilta and Columbia Defendants did not file independent briefs in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion, they did file 
notices of joinder in the opposition filed by Weingold and Rock, a procedure the Court expressly allowed. Hence, while Weingold 
and Rock have withdrawn their own opposition, the Court will consider the substantive arguments in their opposition brief, as if 
asserted by DeMilta and Columbia. The remaining Defendants have not opposed Plaintiffs' motion."
76,2," The facts contained in this section are taken from the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint 
(""Complaint"")(Doc. 180), and are set forth here for purposes of aiding the Court in its understanding of the factual backdrop of 
this case. In its consideration of the Plaintiffs' class certification motion, the Court does not determine the truth of these alleged 
facts."
76,3," Defendants vigorously argue that the prices set forth in the industry publications are those for processed scrap, not the 
unprocessed raw materials. The record unambiguously indicates, however, that the prices for unprocessed scrap bear some 
relationship to the quoted prices. "
78,4," Despite having joined in Rock and Weingold's opposition to Plaintiffs' underlying motion for class certification, no defendant 
filed a notice of joinder in Rock and Weingold's opposition to the motion to strike. "
81,5," Accordingly, the Court rejects the argument of defendant Bluestar (the only defendant to object to the satisfaction of either the 
typicality or adequacy requirements) that the class should be divided into subclasses based on whether a class member has 
dealt with each particular defendant. (Doc. 248, at 3). Bluestar's attempt to limit the scope of the class is appropriate to the 
damages inquiry, not to the liability class certification inquiry. Similarly, the fact that certain customers of Bluestar may have 
signed release documents as to Bluestar does not defeat the appropriateness of certification. Again, this fact is appropriate for 
consideration at the damages stage, since the releases may limit the amount of damages recoverable by certain class members, 
or may affect the percentage of damages potentially attributable to Bluestar. "
82,6," The motion for withdrawal filed by Bic Manufacturing, Inc. and Talan Products, Inc.(Doc. 205) explains that these entities 
desired to withdraw as class representatives because of the enormous expense they were required to incur in representing the 
class. Plaintiff Shiloh Industries, Inc. indicated its desire to withdraw for similar reasons. (Doc. 179)."
82,7," Since the Plaintiffs do not seek class certification under any other subsection, the Court need not conduct a detailed analysis of 
those subsections here."
82,8," Paragraph one of the Complaint refers to Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26, while the Count I title 
refers to 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 15. "
84,9," Thus, the Court rejects defendant Bluestar's argument that the Plaintiffs' class definition is insufficiently specific. (Doc. 228, at 
2-3). "
86,10," Additionally, the applicable due diligence standard is an objective one; thus, if a reasonably diligent plaintiff would not have 
discovered the conspiracy, then it does not matter whether a plaintiff in fact exercised reasonable diligence. See Sterlin v. 
Biomune Sys., Inc., 154 F.3d 1191, 1202, n.20 (10th Cir. 1998). "
87,11," See also In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322, 358 (E.D. Pa. 1976), which sets forth severally generally 
applicable reasons for certifying a class in the antitrust context: (1) the alleged economic injuries to many proposed class members are too minuscule to justify their independent 
commencement of actions; (2) the proliferation of lawsuits that otherwise would result from the alleged pervasive 
conspiracy absent class actions will be minimized; (3) duplicative efforts by the judiciary and the litigants will be eliminated; 
(4) duplicative litigation expenses and attorneys' fees will be prevented; (5) defendants will be relieved from the burden of 
defending numerous lawsuits geographically scattered throughout the nation; and (6) inconsistent judicial decisions will be 
avoided. Id. "
88,12," The Court has rephrased the language of the Plaintiffs' proposed Class, in order to avoid the appearance of any value 
judgment as to the ultimate liability of the Defendants to the Class, which would be inappropriate at this stage in the litigation. "
93,1,"  Prior to 1999, credentialed members of the media could view scores in the media center and then re-key them directly into 
their own computers for transmission to their company's Internet servers. The result was that competitors of pgatour.com, 
including Morris, were able to publish real-time scores on their web sites as fast as or possibly faster than pgatour.com. 
Beginning in January 1999, shortly after the PGA Tour entered into an exclusive syndication contract with USA Today, it 
instituted [OLSR] applicable to all credentialed media invitees. Around the same time, Morris began publishing scores from 
PGA Tour tournaments on its web sites and selling them to third parties, and Morris appears to have been the PGA Tour's 
only major competitor in the syndication market. Morris Communications Corp. v. PGA Tour, Inc., 235 F. Supp. 2d 1269, 1274 (M.D. Fla. 2002). The version of the OLSR at 
issue here was instituted in January 2000."
93,2," PGA agreed that once the golf scores are posted on its website, they are in the public domain. Id. at 1275 n.9."
93,3," ""No scoring information may be used by, sold, given, distributed or otherwise transferred to, any party other than the 
Credentialed Site in any manner whatsoever, without the prior written consent of PGA TOUR."" [R. Vol. 1 at Tab 1, Exh. 4.] "
94,4," Morris also alleged violations of Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. § 501.201 et seq., and 
tortious interference with contract. Morris has not appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of PGA on 
these claims."
94,5," The district court did not, however, find that PGA had unlawfully monopolized or refused to deal. To the contrary, the district 
court found that Morris failed to prove a § 2 claim of monopolization as a matter of law, Morris Communications, 235 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1283; that the media center was not an essential facility, id. at 1285; that PGA did not have unlawful intent to harm 
competition or a competitor, id. at 1284, and thus did not unlawfully refuse to deal with Morris, id. at 1285-86, engage in unlawful 
monopoly leveraging, id. at 1286, or unlawfully attempt to monopolize, id."
94,6," The arguments of Morris and its amici, who are various media organizations, entities, and associations, focus largely on 
irrelevant copyright law and argue that facts, such as golf scores, and compilations of facts are generally not a proper subject for 
copyright protection. While this assertion is a correct statement of law, it has no bearing on whether the golf scores and 
compilation of golf scores are the proprietary product of PGA's RTSS. At oral argument, Morris conceded that this is not a 
copyright case. "
95,7," In its argument for summary judgment in the district court, Morris stated that ""this case is not a First Amendment case . . . it's 
an antitrust case."" [R. Vol. 10 at pp. 8-9.]"
95,8," As the district court stated at the hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, ""all that this court is interested in is the 
issues that you people bring to it. We're not making advisory opinions. And we don't change the facts. The facts are what the 
facts are. And what [we] rule on today may be a lot different than the case the two of you are involved in tomorrow."" [R. Vol. 10 
at p. 106.]"
95,9," At the hearing regarding the preliminary injunction, the district court asked counsel for PGA if PGA would permit ""Morris . . . to 
disseminate this information to its companies, its various news companies, not charging them anything, just disseminating it""? 
Counsel for PGA responded: There's no problem because that to us is news coverage, and . . . we eagerly, eagerly invite and want the press to do their 
function, their normal function of gathering and disseminating the news, and because it's so important to us to have them 
do that, we told Morris a year ago that we would allow them in the media center to sit there and re-key right from there into 
their own website and any of their related companies as a matter of news coverage, they could have those real-time scores 
right away for free. . . . The problem comes in only when Morris wishes to go into another business, which they label the 
news syndication business. . . . It is not the business of gathering and disseminating news. It is the business of selling a 
commercially valuable product that we have developed and paid for and we ought to be the ones to sell that. [R. Vol. 8 at pp. 34-36.]"
95,10," Morris challenges the district court's resolution of its monopolization and attempt to monopolize claims. For the purposes of 
this case, the elements of the two offenses differ in only one material respect: attempt to monopolize requires specific intent to 
achieve monopoly power. See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 890-91, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 
(1993) HN3[
] (""To demonstrate attempted monopolization a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant has engaged in 
predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving 
monopoly power.""). Therefore, the attempt claim in this case is more difficult to maintain and prove. Because Morris does not 
withstand summary judgment on its monopolization claim, it cannot maintain its attempt claim. Accordingly, we decline to 
discuss the attempt claim further. "
96,11," Morris challenges the district court's resolution of its refusal to deal and monopoly leveraging claims. For purposes of this 
case, the elements of the two claims are sufficiently similar to warrant only one discussion. See Verizon Communications, Inc. v. 
Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823, 124 S. Ct. 872, 883 n.4 (2004) (""Leveraging presupposes 
anticompetitive conduct, which in this case could only be the refusal-to-deal claim we have rejected."")."
96,12," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207-09 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
Fifth Circuit decisions issued prior to October 1, 1981. "
97,13," Morris also argues that PGA is not allowed to put restrictions on the dissemination of the compiled golf scores once they reach 
the media center because PGA did not previously put any restrictions on their dissemination. This argument is unpersuasive. 
PGA has a right to control its property interest in its RTSS and the compiled golf scores, which are the product of RTSS, 
regardless of its past practices. As the district court stated: ""what [PGA] say[s] the delay should be and what delay [PGA] can 
legally impose are two different things perhaps."" [R. Vol. 10 at p. 104.] The lack of prior restrictions is merely indicative of PGA's 
symbiotic relationship with the media."
97,14," Morris stated in the district court that it was ""not disputing that [PGA] may have a property right."" [R. Vol. 10 at p. 93.] As 
counsel for PGA stated at the hearing on the preliminary injunction: ""without this elaborate, comprehensive system there 
wouldn't be real-time scores that Morris would like to sell to third parties. It just wouldn't be there because these don't exist in the 
air."" [R. Vol. 8 at p. 31.] "

135,2," NIPP alleges that the relevant markets are the markets for rock radio and rock concerts in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan 
area. "
138,3," There is a lack of case law regarding whether state or federal alter ego common law is properly applied in federal antitrust 
cases. Because federal law and Colorado state law are very similar, the result would be the same whether federal or state law 
were applied. Accordingly, the court will apply federal law because the majority of the relevant claims fall under federal law. "
140,4," Because Colorado antitrust law mirrors federal antitrust law under the Sherman Act, the court will solely examine plaintiffs' 
claims under federal law as dispositive of plaintiffs' state law claims. "
143,5," Should the jury conclude that the relevant market is the output market for rock concert tickets, the jury will have to examine 
Clear Channel's control over inputs necessary for the production of concert tickets in order to evaluate the anticompetitive nature 
of Clear Channel's conduct. Because Clear Channel's alleged control over all of these inputs stems from its alleged control over 
rock radio stations, NIPP introduces evidence of Clear Channel's control over the rock radio market in the Denver metropolitan 
area. While such evidence will be useful, and perhaps necessary, to demonstrate Clear Channel's control over inputs and 
monopolistic leveraging to control the downstream market, it is unnecessary at the relevant market definition stage of the 
analysis of NIPP's monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. There is only one relevant market definition for NIPP's 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims, despite the fact that numerous inputs are implicated. The rock radio 
market is implicated in NIPP's other antitrust claims, however. "

1464, 1469, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). Under section 2, however, independent action may form the basis of liability. "
172,10," NIPP provides other alleged examples of interference with contract. (Pls.' Resp., Ex. 84 [Chart of Alleged Interference].)

Channel ceased air play for those artists choosing other concert promoters. "
185,1," Originally, the various defendants filed twenty-one (21) motions for summary judgment concerning the scope of the all-vitamins

186,," On August 6, 2002, DuPont filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Issue of an All Vitamins Conspiracy in ten 
individual cases. At the time the March 9, 2004 Memorandum Opinion was issued, DuPont had settled with each of the plaintiffs 
against whom it had moved for summary judgment. DuPont failed, however, to inform the Court of the status of its motion. In the 
Proposed Agenda for February 18, 2004 Status Conference, DuPont's all-vitamins conspiracy motion was listed in section G as 
one of the ""Dispositive Motions Before the Court that the Parties Agree Should Be Decided Prior to Remand."" Furthermore, at

specifically addressed section G of the agenda confirming which listed motions had been mooted. See Tr. of Feb. 18, 2004 
Status Conference at 25-27. The Court is loath to consider the number of hours and judicial resources that were wasted in deciding a motion, the moot status 
of which counsel neglected to timely inform the Court. In the interests of justice, however, the holding as to DuPont must be 
removed from this Memorandum Opinion in light of the settlements that had taken place before the original Memorandum

considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Id. at 1042. The standard of review

claimed that in 1988, the defendants secretly agreed to raise prices of differently graded HFCS products. These artificial price 
increases allegedly continued until approximately mid-1995. Id. at 653-54. Judge Posner, writing for the three judge panel, held

proposed indirect purchaser state class is proceeding under an Illinois Brick repealer statute, or under unfair trade practices 
legislation."
216,6," As will be addressed in section III.C.I below, the various state statutes under which Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs are proceeding 
require the same elements for claims of monopolization and restraint of trade as the federal antitrust laws."
216,7," Third-party payers, sometimes referred to here as TPPs, can be further categorized into: (1) traditional insurers, such as 
proposed class representatives Cobalt, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Alabama, and (2) 
self-funded employer health benefit plans (""SFPs"") that act as insurers for their own employees. "
217,8," The Court notes that this proposed class definition represents a slight modification of the original definition suggested by the 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs. Specifically, the current proposal provides a June 30, 2002 end date for the class period. When 
asked about the significance of this date at the March 12, 2004 oral argument. Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs responded that it 
does not have any particular significance, but that it represents a reasonable ending date for the class period. While some 
residual damages may have continued to accrue after that date, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs believe that prices had stabilized by 
then. Defendants have not asserted any particular opposition to the June 30, 2002 date."
217,9," The clear exclusion of ""indirect purchasers who suffered no economic injury as a result of Defendants' allegedly unlawful 
conduct"" also represents a modification of the original class definition. As will be more fully discussed below, this exclusion 
eliminates some of the potential conflicts that may arise in the context of the Rule 23(a)(4) analysis. "
218,10," Although the Eleventh Circuit instructs that each claim must be analyzed separately for standing purposes. In this case, the 
interwoven facts that give rise to both Plaintiffs' antitrust and unjust enrichment claims indicate that any class representative who 
has Article III standing for one claim will necessarily have standing for the other. See IPPs' Mot. at p. 45 (""The same operative 
facts which form the basis of each of the state Classes' claims based upon antitrust theories form the basis of the Classes' 
claims for unjust enrichment"") Indeed, in then arguments on standing and typicality. Defendants have failed to distinguish 
between the antitrust and unjust enrichment claims."
218,11," Because many of the elements relevant to class certification overlap with one another, the Court will often cross-reference 
other sections in this Order. For the convenience of the parties, the Court has appended to the end of this Order an index listing 
the pages on which each subsection begins."
218,12," Defendants, in a footnote devoid of any citations, also challenge Cobalt's standing in South Dakota and West Virginia. 
Specifically, Defendants argue that because those states' monopolization claims test on allegations regarding Abbott's unilateral "
219,," conduct between 1995 and 1998, and Cobalt made no purchases in those states during that time period. Cobalt lacks standing 
either individually or as a representative of the class. See Defs.' Opp'n. at p. 51, n. 26. Defendants have failed to provide any 
support for this argument. As will be discussed in more detail under the typicality requirement, there is no requirement under 
Rule 23 that the claims of the named class representatives be identical in substance or scope to those of the class members, 
either for standing or for typicality purposes. See Section III. B. 3 below. Therefore, the mere fact that Cobalt's rembursements 
were not made during the same time period as the class' allegations does not defeat Cobalt's standing in those states."
219,13," In the Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig case, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia recognized 
that basing class eligibility on, for instance, the location of the pharmacy where the prescription is filled or the state where the 
third-party payer resides, would result in ""anomalous situations"" in which residents of particular states could benefit from other 
state's statutes although the legislature of their own states intended for no such protections. 205 F.R.D. at 396-97."
219,14," Although Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' did not dispute Defendants' interpretation of the Donnelly Act, they did argue that 
""Defendants' merits-based statute of limitations arguments are improperly raised in this class certification motion."" However, the 
Eleventh Circuit has recognized that ""a class representative whose claim is time-barred cannot assert the claim on behalf of the 
class."" See Piazza v Ebsco Indus. Inc, 273 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Carter v West Publ'g Co, 225 F.3d 1258, 1267 
(11th Cir 2000) (reversing class certification because the named plaintiff, whose claim was time-barred, lacked standing to 
assert the claim)). While the Court reaches no ultimate conclusion on the merits of Defendants' statute of limitations argument, it 
appears, based on the information presently before the Court, that Cobalt's New York claims cannot proceed. "
220,15," On March 2, 2004, Alabama Blue and Michigan Blue moved the Court for permission to be joined as named class 
representatives in all of the other proposed state classes [DE-1086]. The Court denied their motion as untimely."
220,16," If the record evidence ultimately reveals that Alabama Blue and or Michigan Blue do not have standing to assert these claims, 
the Court may, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(C), amend its Order at any time before final judgment. "
221,17," At the hearing held on March 12, 2004, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' counsel posited that evidence exists to support the 
conclusion that Mr. Reid would have switched to the generic had it been available earlier. However, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
counsel admitted that any claim by Mr. Reid under the antitrust laws is too speculative, thereby conceding that Mr. Reid does not 
have standing to assert any antitrust violations on behalf of the class."
221,18," In conceding that Mr. Reid does not have standing to assert the antitrust violations on behalf of the class. Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs suggested that Mr. Reid does have standing for unjust enrichment claims. However, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have 
failed to demonstrate (either in their submissions of at oral argument) how Mr. Reid, who did not pay any overcharge or suffet 
any economic damage, has standing to raise the claims that Defendants were unjustly enriched with excessive profits. "
222,19," In Bonner v City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as 
binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
223,20," IMS monitors prescriptions, compiling data by product and by distribution channel for a number of customers, including 
pharmaceutical companies. As Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs noted at the March 12, 2004 oral argument. Abbott itself also relied 
on IMS data to predict the impact that generic entry would have on the market. Abbott has not disputed this."
223,21," As observed by several courts and commentators, once the good faith estimate of the class size reaches the thousands, the 
joinder impracticability test is satisfied and the analysis focuses on the ""manageability and superiority of the proposed class 
action relative to other means for fan adjudication of the controversy."" See I Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class 
Actions § 3:5 (4th ed. 2002). These issues will he addressed later in the Court's analysis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). "
224,22," While Defendants do not contest that there are common questions of law or fact sufficient to meet the Rule 23(a)(2) 
requirement, they do contend that the proposed classes cannot be certified because those common issues do not predominate 
over questions affecting only individual class members. This argument, however, is properly considered in the Rule 23(b)(3) 
analysis, and will be addressed at that time."
224,23," The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that ""in many ways, the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) overlap. 
Both requirements focus on whether a sufficient nexus exists between the legal claims of the named class representatives and 
those of individual class members to warrant class certification. Traditionally, commonality refers to the group characteristics of 
the class as a whole and typicality refers to the individual characteristics of the named plaintiff in relation to the class."" Prado-
Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1278-79 (internal citations omitted). "
225,24," While Defendants state that they challenge Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' ability to meet the Rule 23(a)(3) standard, they have 
focused their arguments on the 23(a)(4) and 23(b)(3) elements, never clearly articulating the nature of their opposition with 
respect to the typicality prong. The elements of Rule 23 are overlapping and often difficult to extricate from one another. 
Therefore, while Defendants have asserted additional arguments that may, arguably, apply to the typicality analysis, those 
arguments are more appropriately considered in the Court's analysis of Rule 23(a)(4)and 23(b)(3). "
226,25," In assessing whether a realistic possibility of antagonism exists, the Eleventh Circuit has looked at the economic realities of 
the case to determine whether ""the economic interests and objectives of the named representatives differ significantly from the 
economic interests and objectives of unnamed class representatives."" See Valley Drug Co., 350 F.3d at 1189-90. "
227,26," While this issue was already addressed in the typicality section, it is also relevant to the analysis of the ""adequacy of 
representation"" prong, as Defendants contend that fundamental conflicts between the two types of end-payers preclude the 
certification of mixed consumer-TPP classes."
227,27," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs also contend that the pass-on issue is ""at best, an affirmative defense and may not be considered 
at the class certification stage."" See IPPs' Reply, at pp. 11-12. Because Defendants' pass-on argument requires resolution of the 
factual issue of whether overcharges are actually passed on to premium payers, as well as the legal issue of whether the pass-
on defense is viable under a given state's antitrust law. Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs contend that consideration of this issue is 
premature at the class certification stage. ld. (citing In re Domestic Air Transp Antitrust Litig., 137 F.R.D. at 696 Indirect 
Purchaser Plaintiffs also contend that Hanover Shoe v United Shoe Machinery Corp, 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 
2224 (1968), prohibits defensive use of the pass-on argument. However, in Valley Drug Co., the Eleventh Circuit disapproved of 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff's attempt to use Hanover Shoe as ""a talisman warding away the requirements of Rule 23 and barring 
this court from exercising its duty to conduct an inquiry into whether the plaintiffs' proposed class satisfied the four requirements 
of Rule 23(a)."" Valley Drug Co., 350 F.3d at 1192. Therefore, because the pass-on issue is relevant to the determination of 
whether any conflicts exist that would preclude class certification, the Court has conducted its own analysis of the record 
evidence upon which Defendants rely. "
228,28," Defendants also make a more general argument that conflict necessarily exists between third-party payers and consumers 
because third party payers will presumably seek to maximize their damages to the detriment of consumer class members. See 
Defs.' Opp'n, at pp. 44-45. The same argument was rejected by the Court in In re Cardizem200 F.R.D. 326 at 337. ""Such 
hypothetical conflicts regarding proof of damages are not sufficient to defeat class certification at this stage of the litigation."" Id. 
(citing In re NASDAQ. 169 F.R.D. at 512)."
228,29," Defendants also present this argument as a challenge to the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). I here, Defendants 
contend that the role of PBMs creates individualized issues that preclude class treatment. In the interest of clarity and brevity, 
the Court will only analyze this asserted challenge in this section. "
229,30," As with other areas of their argument, Defendants' issues regarding PBMs apply to several portions of the Rule 23 analysis. In 
particular, Defendants argue that: the inclusion of PBMs in the classes will require several individualized inquiries to prove 
impact (which relates primarily to the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3)); calculating class-wide damages will be 
impossible in light of the PBMs (also relevant to the Rule 23(b)(3) analysis): and intra-class conflicts potentially exist between 
PBMs and their insurer clients (relevant to the instant Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy of representation analysis). Because these issues 
are, to a certain extent, inextricably intertwined, they will all be addressed in this section."
229,31," Defendants provide two potential sources of the ""risk"" allegedly borne by the PBMs. First, they argue that PBMs have 
manipulated ""spreads"" between the amounts that PBMs pay to pharmacies for prescriptions and the amounts that PBMs are 
reimbursed by their insurer clients in order to reap unfair profits at the insurers' expense. See DE-1052 at 4; see also Defs.' 
Opp'n, at pp. 31-32. To the extent that there was an overcharge on Hytrin. Defendants argue. PBMs would have borne a portion 
of the overcharge as a result of the spread between their pharmacy and insurer reimbursement formulas. Id. Second, 
Defendants contend that PBMs with ""capitated"" fee arrangements where the insurer pays the PBM a negotrated fee per member 
per month in exchange for the PBM bearing the responsibility for reimbursing all covered claims bear the risk of any overcharges 
and also shield the insurer from any such overcharges. Id."
229,32," On the ""spread"" issue, Defendants primarily rely on two recently filed state court complaints in California and Ohio. See DE-
1052 at pp. 4-6. In those two cases, the plaintiffs merely alleged what Defendants argue here, that such spreads existed, 
resulting in PBMs like Medco reaping improper benefits from then processing of Hytrin prescriptions. Id. However, Defendants' 
assertion that ""the very existence of the two lawsuits demonstrates an actual conflict among putative class members on these 
issues,"" see id. at p. 6. is incorrect. As noted above, a party seeking to demonstrate a fundamental class conflict must either cite 
to record evidence establishing an actual disagreement or conflict, or provide a sufficient basis for the court to imply that a "
230,," realistic possibility of antagonism exists. See Miles, 916 F.2d at 1534. The existence of untested allegations in two state court 
complaints satisfies neither standard."
230,33," Defendants argument that Dr. Hartman's proposed methodologies for calculating class-wide damages fails to account for the 
exclusion of flat co-paying insurers will be addressed in connection with the Court's Rule 23(b)(3) analysis. See Section III.C.I 
below."
230,34," As with the flat co-payers. Defendants lead into their Rule 23(b)(3) challenge on the predominance issue by arguing that Dr. 
Hartman's methodology fails to account for brand loyalists. Specifically, Defendants contend that Dr. Hartman has not quantified 
how many brand loyal consumers are in the proposed classes, and that he has not proposed any method to determine this "
231,," information without individualized inquiries. Again, these issues, which overlap somewhat with the instant Rule 23(a)(4) conflicts 
analysis, are more appropriately addressed as part of the Court's Rule 23(b)(3) analysis. See Section III.C."
231,35," To a certain extent, the Rule 23(a)(4) analysis collapses into the Rule 23(a)(3) consideration of typicality, ""because in the 
absence of typical claims, the class representative has no incentives to pursue the claims of the other class members."""
231,36," The Court also notes that to the extent that they will act as representatives of the consumer class members (and state 
agencies who purchased Hytrin) in their states, the Attorneys General from the states of Florida and Kansas are adequate 
representatives who will vigorously prosecute the claims of those states' consumers. At the March 12, 2004 oral argument, the 
Court inquired of the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs as to the precise nature of the Attorneys General's involvement in this litigation. 
As explained by Barbara Smithers, Assistant Florida Attorney General, and Patricia Connors, the Chair of the Multistate Task 
Force of the Antitrust Division of the Florida Attorney General's office, class counsel to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs has 
ceded the lead in representation of the consumer claims in Florida and Kansas to the Attorneys General's offices In fact, the 
Attorneys General have a ""co-counsel"" relationship with Co-Lead Counsel. Then primary involvement, however, will be in the 
civil penalties damages phase of the case and in representing the interests of the individual consumers in any mediation 
activities. "
232,37," See generally Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469, 57 L. Ed. 2d 351, 98 S. Ct. 2454 (1978) (""Class 
determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's 
cause of action."") (quotingMercantile Nat'l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558, 9 L. Ed. 2d 523, 83 S. Ct. 520 (1963)); id at 
469 n. 12 ('""The more complex determinations required in Rule 23(b)(3) class actions entail even greater entanglement with the 
merits.'"") (quoting 15 C. Wright, A. Millet, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3911.p. 485 n. 45 (1976)); Castano v. 
American Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 744 (5th Cir. 1996) (""Going beyond the pleadings is necessary, as a court must understand 
the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the 
certification issues.""); Huff v. N.D. Cass Co., 485 F.2d 710, 714 (5th Cir. 1973) (enbanc) (""It is inescapable that in some cases 
there will be overlap between the demands of [Rule] 23(a) and (b) and the question of whether plaintiff can succeed on the 
merits.""). "
233,38," Based on the controlling precedents in each state, the primary difference between the state antitrust laws and the federal 
statutes is that indirect purchasers, to the extent they can prove that they were injured by Defendants' conduct, have standing to 
prosecute the state law claims. See California v. ARC Am Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661 (1989). "
234,39," In their papers supporting class certification, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs never succinctly set forth their proposed common 
proof on impact. However, reading the relevant submissions and exhibits in their entirely, it is apparent that the factual 
demonstrations listed above are the primary sources of Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' proposed ""generalized evidence"" to prove 
impact. "
235,40," The standards for evaluating each of the various states classes' unjust enrichment claims are virtually identical. HN26[
] 
Courts have recognized that state claims of unjust enrichment ""are universally recognized causes of action that are materially 
the same throughout the United States."" Singer v. AT&T Corp. 185 F.R.D. 681, 692 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (citing Sollenbarger v. 
Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., 121 F.R.D. 417, 428 (D.N.M. 1988)). In fact, courts in Alabama, California, Illinois, Kansas, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin 
have expressly followed or cited with approval the Restatement's definition of unjust enrichment. See IPPs' Mot. at p. 19. n. 11. 
While Florida, Maine and South Dakota do not cite the Restatement, the elements of an unjust enrichment claim in those states 
mirror those of the Restatement, only adding the additional element of ""realization,"" ""appreciation,"" or some kind of knowledge 
on the part of the Defendants of the conferral of the benefit by the Plaintiff. Id. at pp. 19-20 (citing Florida, Maine and South 
Dakota appellate decisions interpreting the unjust enrichment standard). Because Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have indicated 
that they will present common evidence establishing this additional ""appreciation"" element, the absence of such a requirement 
under the Restatement (and the law of the states that follow it) presents no obstacle to class certification."
235,41," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have explained the evidentiary link between their antitrust and unjust enrichment claims as such 
""All of the Classes' claims allege that Abbott's illegal conduct created an exclusionary, anti competitive market for the sale of 
terazosin and that as a result. Plaintiffs paid too much for their prescriptions Defendants were unjustly enriched by the illegal 
overcharges and equity requires disgorgement for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and the members of each of the state Classes."" 
See IPPs' Mot. at p. 45. "
236,42," As part of this analysis, Dr. Hartman calculates the actual price of Hytrin minus the ""but for"" price absent the illegal conduct, 
times the quantity that would have been purchased absent the illegal conduct. Using this formula, Dr. Hartman determines: (1) 
the but-for penetration rate of generic terazosin during the relevant period; (2) the but-for prices of Hytrin and generic terazosin; 
and (3) the price differential between actual Hytrin prices and the but-for price of its AB-rated generic bioequivalent during the 
class period. Dr. Hartman has determined each of these inputs and calculated actual damages, with data covering a sufficient 
number of transactions so as to be scientifically accurate. Dr. Hartman has also factored into his calculations the necessary 
variations in the industry, such as pricing and substitution rates."
236,43," Both Rule 23(e)(1)(C), which allows for the amendment of class certification orders at any time before final judgment, and Rule 
23(d), which authorizes courts to make appropriate orders to facilitate class action proceedings, provide ample avenues for the 
Court to deal with any potential difficulties associated with damage allocations as they may arise. In addition, while the Court 
acknowledges that this case has progressed further than most cases prior to the class certification ruling, the temporal proximity 
to trial does not mandate that the Court select a definite damages-methodology, particularly in advance of any Daubert 
proceedings. "
237,44," See also Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bank v Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 339, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427, 100 S. Ct. 1166 (1980) (noting that 
""where it is not economically feasible to obtain relief within the traditional framework of a multiplicity of small individual suits for 
damages, aggrieved persons may be without any effective redress unless they may employ the class action device."")."
237,45," In particular, the Court finds Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' response to this argument particularly persuasive. Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs point out that they ""are not seeking to apply a single state's law to a nationwide, or even a multistage, class of "
238,," purchasers, but rather to apply state law to separate state classes that include those persons who purchased Hytrin in each 
state."" See IPPs' Reply, at p. 24. Therefore, each state's substantive antitrust law will apply to that particular state class' claims. 
As addressed in Section III.C.1 above, this does not pose a manageability problem because the applicable substantive laws are 
virtually identical in their required elements."
238,46," In addressing manageability arguments similar to those that Defendants assert, the Southern District of New York noted that 
""if individual damage questions were a barrier to class certification, there would be little if any place for the class action device in 
the adjudication of antitrust claims."" In re NASDAQ, 169 F.R.D. at 524. In the event that complications in calculating damages 
arise, the court in Cardizem has suggested three solutions for remedying the problem: (1) the Court could alter or amend its 
class certification order under Rule 23(c)(1); (2) the Court could bifurcate the liability and damages phases of the litigation, and 
only allow the action to proceed as a class for liability purposes; and (3) the Court could appoint a special master or a magistrate 
judge to assist in calculating damages. See In re Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 351 (citing Little Caesar Entm't, Inc v. Smith, 172 
F.R.D. 236, (E.D. Mich. 1997)). All of these options are similarly available to this Court should complications arise."
238,47," As pointed out by Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs, Defendants successfully stayed other individual and class cases in various 
state courts pending the outcome of the state law claims now before this Court. See DE-1021 at pp. 14-15. In support of their 
motions to stay, Defendants contradicted their current position, arguing that this Count is the superior forum to resolve all of the 
state law claims. For instance, in Damels v. Abbott Lab., et al, Case No. 00CC04975 (Cal.), Defendants acknowledged that this 
Court ""is uniquely positioned to reach a comprehensive and appropriate resolution of this nationwide dispute that adequately 
accounts for the interests of all concerned and avoids inconsistent or duplicative judgments."" In another related state court case, 
Asher v. Abbott Laboratortes, et al, 307 A.D.2d 211, 763 N.Y.S. 2d 555 (1st Dep't 2003), the New York appellate court, 
responding to Defendants' request to stay, agreed that this ""federal action will result in a more complete disposition of the basic 
antitrust issues alleged."" Id. Therefore, Defendants have, in essence, conceded that this class action is the superior mechanism 
for adjudicating these disputes."
238,48," Although WJRB was only appointed as Co-Lead Counsel on February 18, 2004, the Court notes that the firm had previously 
been an active member of the Executive Committee on behalf of the end-payer classes. "
239,49," Specifically, the Court's Order [DE-1055] required Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs to submit additional information regarding the 
work proposed class counsel has done in this case, counsel's knowledge of the applicable law (and particularly, the law as to 
damage calculation involving third-party payers of ultimate consumer drug costs), the resources counsel will commit to 
representing the class, and counsel's proposed terms as to attorneys fees and nontaxable costs."
239,50," While Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have not provided a list of cases in which Co-Lead Counsel WJRB participated, the Court 
notes that members of that firm have experience as lead counsel to several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in national mass 
tort litigation, including proceedings involving breast implants and fen-phen."
239,51," The class representatives for each state class of end-payers are identified in Section III.A., supra. "
246,1, Craftsmen voluntarily dismissed or settled with all defendants but Ford and American Coach. 
247,2," Craftsmen also relied upon testing Ford had conducted on its base vehicles to verify the safety of components that were not 
altered during the conversion process, such as door locks. "
248,3," To assist those coachbuilders wanting to safely go beyond the QVM guidelines, Ford provided the names of engineering firms 
that did testing or analysis. T1461."
248,4, The record indicates that more than ninety percent of Craftsmen's conversions were over 120 inches. 
249,5," The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety compliance engineer who inspected the brake systems on 
Craftsmen's vehicles concluded: ""It appears Craftsmen exercised caution during vehicle production by following Ford's QVM 
guidelines for limousine manufacturers and sound manufacturing processes for all other vehicles. Therefore, Craftsmen's 
limousines may meet the performance requirements of [the federal safety standard pertaining to hydraulic brakes], but there is 
no test data to form definite conclusions."" (App. at 2320.)"
249,6," The only test reports LIMO submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration were in regard to the safety of 
limousine hydraulic brake systems. "
250,7," In 1997, two new magazines entered the limousine publications market, Dealer's National Limousine Exchange and 
International Limousine and Livery Trader. At trial, Haswell testified that these two publications were not comparable to 
Limousine Digest or Limousine & Chauffeured Magazine, as neither provided national exposure."
250,8," Although Craftsmen was allowed to attend Limousine Digest's 1996 trade show, which took place before Limousine Digest 
adopted its formal ban, Craftsmen received unfavorable treatment: it was relegated to an obscure location behind a curtain; it 
was required to remove its display car from the showroom after only one night of the three-night show; and it was not allowed to 
distribute brochures."
250,9," At trial, Ric Cohen testified that Limousine Digest's policy allowed non-QVM/CMC coachbuilders to advertise if they presented 
independent proof of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards compliance. (Tr. 1285.) Ultra Limousine, a non-QVM coachbuilder, 
provided Limousine Digest with independent crash-testing data and subsequently advertised a non-QVM limousine in the 
publication. Ultra agreed to share its crash-testing data with Craftsmen in exchange for $ 35,000, half the crash-testing cost. 
Robert Haswell testified that he declined Ultra's offer, because crash-testing was not required for Craftsmen to meet National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration standards. The record contains a memorandum written by a National Highway Traffic "
251,," Safety Administration safety compliance engineer indicating that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not 
require Craftsmen to crash-test its limousines due to their weight. (App. at 2317)."
251,10," During cross-examination, Tortora testified that when Vinnie Bergman, a non-QVM coachbuilder, tried to join LIMO, Ford 
spoke out loudly against it. Despite Ford's protest, LIMO extended membership to Bergman. Defendants claim that they did not 
want Bergman in LIMO, because he had a reputation for dishonesty and engaged in questionable business practices."
251,11," The record suggests that by 1998, Craftsmen began converting sport utility vehicles and buses to mitigate its damages. One 
of the sport utility vehicles Craftsmen converted was Ford's Lincoln Navigator. Limousine & Chauffeured Magazine allowed 
Craftsmen to advertise the stretched Navigators until Ford barred QVM dealers from converting Navigators. "
252,12," Cole used the term ""cost of sales"" to reflect Craftsmen's operating expenses. He testified that he needed a calculation to 
derive an average growth profit percentage ""so that sales that we didn't realize in the future wouldn't have been all profit. They 
would have been a percentage, because there's obviously a cost associated with those sales. So, we had to come up with the 
average growth profit percentage in order to apply it to the sales that were lost in order to get a lost profit number."" Ap. 1773-74 
Cole testified that he calculated a figure of 83.75% as the ""average cost of sales as compared to gross sales for the period '95 
through '98."" Id. "
253,13," Tortora testified that Ford sometimes took part in LIMO meeting discussions on how to keep non-QVM coachbuilders from 
advertising and attending trade shows, and that Ford expressly forbade her from dealing with non-QVM coachbuilders. (Tr. 376.) "
255,14," The dissent in footnote 3 glosses over a fundamental question that must precede application of the per se analysis-whether 
Ford is a horizontal competitor of the coachbuilders. Ford does not manufacture or sell limousines. It manufactures base 
vehicles that are later converted into limousines by coachbuilders. Aside from safety and liability concerns, we question whether 
there are any rational economic reasons for Ford to compete with any of the coachbuilders. Unlike the dissent, we also question 
whether Ford's position in the market as a supplier of base vehicles to coachbuilders changed with the formation of QVM and 
LIMO. "
256,15," The dissent makes the case for why Ford's safety concerns were a pretext for anti-competitive behavior. However, it ignores 
countervailing evidence that the Federal Government encouraged Ford to develop testing to ensure that converted limousines 
complied with federal safety standards. The evidence presented at trial created a legitimate fact dispute that the jury should have 
analyzed under the rule of reason rather than the per se rule, which presumes that Ford's motives and the effect of its actions 
were anti-competitive. "
257,16," We are not foreclosing the possibility Cole can testify at a new trial. We agree he is qualified. He will have to formulate a new 
opinion using the proper standard under a rule of reason analysis."
257,17," The boycott agreement and resulting advertising restriction were documented in: 1) the April 30, 1996, LIMO minutes that set 
out the boycott agreement (J.A. 02091-92); 2) the May 6, 1996, letter from LIMO to the magazine that threatened the boycott 
(J.A. 02093-94); and 3) the May 9, 1996, fax from the president of LIMO to his fellow members congratulating them on the 
magazine's change of policy to ban advertisements of non-QVM/CMC coachbuilders (J.A. 02085)."
257,18," The district court decided the parties' motions for and against application of the per se rule from the bench at the close of the 
Plaintiff's evidence and did not give a rationale for why application of that rule was appropriate. (Tr. 1431-32.) "
258,19," I submit that there should be little doubt as to the existence of a horizontal agreement between the Defendants. Ford, a 
member of LIMO, had obviously involved itself in the manufacturing of limousines. Furthermore, the majority was correct to 
identify the existence of a conspiracy among the Defendants. I would only add that in addition to the evidence highlighted by the 
majority, the following evidence also supports that Ford influenced LIMO's agenda and spearheaded the boycott effort: 1) Ford 
encouraged the formation of LIMO around the time QVM began (Tr. 275); 2) Ford lobbied to keep non-QVM members out of 
LIMO (Tr. 28990 ); 3) Ford voiced its opposition to allowing QVM members to advertise in trade journals that allowed non-QVM 
members to advertise (Tr. 347); 4) the magazines themselves seemed to be receiving similar pressure directly from Ford (Tr. 
332-35); and 5) Ford pressured LIMO coachbuilders to make them keep non-QVM members out of LIMO because ""[Ford] felt it 
was better coming from [LIMO] as an organization."" (Tr. 282.)"
258,20," Neither Defendant advocated, or discussed, the application of the ""quick look"" standard, and it is not appropriate in any event 
because, in my view, the restraint is obviously anticompetitive. "
264,1," Familiarity with this Court's November 3, 2003 Memorandum and Order, and the facts and defined terms set forth therein, is 
presumed. "
282,1," Defendants also challenged Count IX of the Complaint, which alleged violations of the Federal Procurement Act. A prior Order 
of this Court dismissed the claims in that Count. (Doc. 109, filed October 29, 2003.)"
282,2, These are the facts as alleged in Lockheed Martin's Complaint. (Doc. 1.) 
287,3," ""EKV"" stands for exoatmospheric kill vehicle. Lockheed alleges that in 1999, Boeing was involved in misconduct pertaining to 
its involvement in the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's competition for the EKV. (Doc. 1 PP156-59.) "
288,4," With one exception, addressed in subsection C.2. of this discussion, the parties agree that the Florida RICO Act was modeled 
after RICO and that their arguments about RICO apply equally to the counterpart state claims. See Gross v. State, 765 So. 2d 
39, 42-43 (Fla. 2000). (See, e.g., Doc. 46 at 4-5 n.2; Doc. 57 at 2 n.2.) "
289,5," It is true that the ""pattern of racketeering"" is alleged to have a much more narrow goal, (see Doc. 1 P177, alleging that the 
pattern of activity was all ""in furtherance of"" the EELV scheme), but HN11[
] the ""'enterprise' is not the 'pattern of racketeering 
activity'; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages."" Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583. A single 
pattern of racketeering activity thus does not define the scope of the enterprise."
289,6," Under RICO, ""'person' includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property . . . ."" 18 
U.S.C. § 1961(3). "
290,7," Even this is a generous reading of Lockheed's definition of the enterprise. Lockheed's proposed enterprise specifically includes 
only the two proposal teams, and does not specifically include Branch. (Doc. 1 P175.) Read strictly, the Complaint alleges that 
subdivisions of Boeing made up the enterprise and thus does not allege that Branch formed a part or was a member of the 
enterprise. Pursuant to this reading, the Complaint only alleges that Branch, along with the other Defendants, ""conducted"" the 
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. (Id.) Branch eventually became a part of the EELV proposal 
team, however, so it is not unfair to presume that Lockheed included Branch as a member of the alleged enterprise."
290,8," It is noted that Center Cadillac was decided before the Second Circuit ruled in Riverwoods that a corporation is not sufficiently 
distinct from an enterprise comprised of its own employees. "
291,9," Lockheed's assertion that Riverwoods is no longer good law lacks merit. It is true that another Second Circuit Court of Appeals 
decision that was later overruled by the Supreme Court had relied on Riverwoods. Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 219 
F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2000), rev'd, 533 U.S. 158, 150 L. Ed. 2d 198, 121 S. Ct. 2087 (2001). The Supreme Court made clear, 
however, that the Second Circuit Cedric Kushner decision had incorrectly analogized to Riverwoods; the Supreme Court did not 
suggest that Riverwoods was not good law. Cedric Kushner, 533 U.S. at 166. "
293,10," With regard to whether there was a continuing and ongoing enterprise, Lockheed's arguments emphasize the several different 
goals of the alleged enterprise and the enterprise's long history and varied personnel. In that context, Lockheed de-emphasizes 
the allegations suggesting that one person and one bid, Branch and the EELV bid, were so integral to many of the alleged 
predicate acts. As already discussed, the allegations about the enterprise do indeed suggest that it was ongoing and continuing 
beyond the five months before Branch was hired and was much larger than Branch himself. With regard to the issue of whether 
Boeing may be a liable person associated with this enterprise, however, Lockheed seeks to define the enterprise by Branch's 
association with it, particularly by five months of that two-year long association. Lockheed cannot have it both ways."
293,11," HN19[
] ""Three elements are needed to establish an apparent agency: (1) a representation by the purported principal; (2) 
reliance on that representation by a third party; and (3) a change in position by the third party in reliance upon such 
representation."" Ilgen v. Henderson Props., Inc., 683 So. 2d 513, 514 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996). Actual agency requires a showing of: 
""(1) acknowledgment by the principal that the agent will act for him; (2) the agent's acceptance of the undertaking; and (3) 
control by the principal over the actions of the agent."" Id. at 515."
293,12," There is no debate about whether Lockheed has sufficiently alleged that Branch (and the other individual defendants) 
""associated with"" and was later ""employed by"" Boeing/the BTSTE. HN20[
] The statute does not suggest, however, that every 
person who ""associates with"" an association-in-fact enterprise and participates in conducting that enterprise's affairs illegally 
need be considered a defining member of that enterprise. Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has often held 
that associations-in-fact are often fluid, ""amoeba-like,"" and comprised of shifting personnel. See, e.g., United States v. Hewes, 
729 F.2d 1302, 1311 (11th Cir. 1984) (rejecting the contention that an association-in-fact ""requires participation of all of its 
members throughout the life of the enterprise"" and finding that ""shifting associations"" whose participants ""overlapped to a 
significant degree"" formed an enterprise under the statute); United States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 698-99 (11th Cir. 1992) 
(same). Many of these difficult distinctness cases could potentially be eliminated by a more particular reading of the association-in-fact 
definition. It could be argued that a RICO defendant corporation should never be considered a ""member"" of an association-in-
fact. The definition of enterprise ""includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any 
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (2001) (emphasis added). 
As the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals once stated, because section 1961(3) defines a ""person"" as an individual or entity 
capable of holding a beneficial interest in property, ""it is clear . . . that 'individual' is used differently from 'person' in the act to 
connote a living person."" United States v. Hartley, 678 F.2d 961, 989 n.46 (11th Cir. 1982), overruled on other grounds by Goldin 
I, 219 F.3d. 1268 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (emphasis added). Because corporations are not living individuals, they thus 
arguably cannot be a part of an association-in-fact under section 1962(c), though of course they can, as ""persons,"" associate 
with an association-in-fact enterprise. Id. This theory that Congress did not have corporations in mind when it wrote the second 
half of section 1961(4) is buttressed by the fact that corporations necessarily fall within the first half of the definition. So does the 
often-repeated theory that the second part of the definition of enterprise was designed to snare not ""duly formed corporation[s] "
294,," that elect[] officers and hold[] annual meetings,"" but ""amoeba-like infra-structure[s] that control[] secret criminal networks."" 
Hewes, 729 F.2d at 1310 (quoting United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 898 (5th Cir. 1978)); contra C.A. Westel de Venez. v. 
Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., No. 90 Civ. 6665, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14481, at *13-15 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 1994) (holding that only an 
""overly rigid"" reading of section 1961(4) would convince that groups of corporations cannot be ""associations in fact"" because the 
definition of enterprise is by its terms not exhaustive, and stating that such a reading would ""perversely insulate the most 
sophisticated racketeering combinations from RICO's sanctions, the precise opposite of Congress' intentions."") This issue is 
academic, however, because it has been either not litigated or overlooked by courts. Moreover, courts in this circuit and others 
have approved associations-in-fact enterprises made up of groupings of corporations. See, e.g., Goldin II, 219 F.3d 1271 (11th 
Cir. 2000)."
294,13," HN22[
] To state a civil conspiracy claim under RICO, a plaintiff need only allege that the defendant conspired to violate 
some substantive provision of RICO, that some member of the conspiracy committed an overt act of racketeering, and that the 
act of racketeering injured the plaintiff. Beck v. Prupis, 162 F.3d 1090, 1098 (11th Cir. 1998), aff'd, 529 U.S. 494, 146 L. Ed. 2d 
561, 120 S. Ct. 1608 (2000). The existence of an ""agreement"" to participate in a RICO conspiracy may be proved by ""showing 
(1) the existence of an agreement on an overall objective, or (2) in the absence of an agreement[] on an overall objective that the 
defendant agreed personally to commit two or more predicate acts."" United States v. Castro, 89 F.3d 1443, 1451 (11th Cir. 
1996). A fact-finder may infer there was an agreement ""from circumstantial evidence of the scheme."" United States v. Church, 
955 F.2d 688, 695 (11th Cir. 1992). In this way, ""the conspiracy provision allows persons who are responsible for an injury, but 
did not actually participate in the injury-causing activity, to be held liable."" Beck, 162 F.3d at 1099 & n.18; Beck, 529 U.S. at 506-
07. "
295,14," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), and the 
intracorporate conspiracy doctrine are discussed at length in the context of Lockheed's Sherman Act claims."
295,15," The Supreme Court did recently confirm that the Copperweld intracorporate conspiracy doctrine ""turns on specific antitrust 
objectives."" Cedric Kushner, 533 U.S. at 166. "
296,16," Though Boeing addressed this element, because the RICO claims against Boeing are dismissed for lack of distinctness the 
rest of this discussion of RICO deals only with the allegations against the individual Defendants-Erskine, Satchell, and Branch."
296,17," HN24[
] The Eleventh Circuit has also stated that proof of the fifth element requires not only evidence of pattern but also 
evidence ""that the defendants' predicate acts were related to the enterprise charged."" Starrett, 55 F.3d at 1542. Erskine, 
Satchell, and Branch have not argued that Lockheed's allegations fail to satisfy this ""relationship"" requirement."
296,18," Erskine does state that ""there is no allegation that Erskine participated in any purported conversion of trade secrets from any 
person or any other than the alleged incident involving Lockheed [sic]."" (Doc. 55 at 4.) It is not clear what he means by this. 
Assuming he means that he is not alleged to have stolen anything himself, this does not bar the claim against him and is not a 
reason to dismiss. Lockheed alleges that the individual Defendants' predicate acts were in the categories of mail fraud, wire 
fraud, and interstate transportation and use of stolen property. (See Doc. 1 P184.) "
297,19," The allegations about the acts of ""Boeing,"" and about the acts of Alexiou, Black, and others employed by Boeing are irrelevant 
here. The RICO claims against Boeing have been dismissed and the other individuals are not named as defendants. The listing 
of these individuals' acts among the allegations of racketeering perhaps stems from confusion about the nature of the pattern 
element. Like each Defendant's failure to focus on the predicate acts alleged to have been committed by himself in favor of more 
general arguments, the allegations referring to non-parties seem to stem from the understanding that, HN27[
] under RICO, 
the plaintiff must establish ""that the acts of racketeering by the alleged enterprise be related and amount to, or pose a threat of, 
continued criminal activity."" (See, e.g., Doc. 41 at 5) (emphasis added.) A person is not liable under section 1962(c) for an 
enterprise's pattern of racketeering activity; he is liable for conducting the affairs of an enterprise through his own pattern of 
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 232, 244. To state a claim against a particular person, a plaintiff 
thus needs to establish much more than that the enterprise's activities pose a threat of continued criminal activity; the plaintiff 
needs to establish that the acts of the person pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This confusion between what a plaintiff must show about what the ""person"" did and what a plaintiff must show about the alleged 
""enterprise"" may exist in part because, as discussed in section A of this discussion, ""continuity"" is relevant to proof of an 
association-in-fact ""enterprise"" and, as explained in this section, to proof of a ""person's"" pattern of racketeering activity. Further 
confusing the issues is the fact that, as discussed below, the nature of the ""enterprise"" may serve as part of the proof that the 
defendant ""person's"" acts constitute an open-ended pattern of racketeering activity. "
298,20, See supra note 4. 
299,21," Many other circuits have held that a plaintiff must allege a viable claim that the defendant violated one of sections 1962(a)-(c) 
in order to state a claim that a defendant violated section 1962(d). See In re Managed Care, 298 F. Supp. 2d 1259, 1285-86 
(S.D. Fla. 2003) (citing cases). Because Lockheed has alleged viable claims against the individual Defendants under section 
1962(c), there is no need to address this issue. "
300,22," HN35[
] ""The Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body of antitrust law developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act."" St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So. 2d 1028, 1032 (Fla. 
2d DCA 1984); § 542.32, Fla. Stat.; All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., Inc., 135 F.3d 740, 745 n.11 (11th 
Cir. 1998) (""Federal and Florida antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law."")."
300,23," Courts sometimes refer to ""relevant product submarkets"" to describe narrow relevant product markets. ""Submarket,"" however, 
is a misnomer; the submarket is simply the relevant market for a specially designed product for which the consumer has a 
relatively inelastic demand. See 2A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law pt. 2, ch.5 P533 (""Speaking of 
submarkets is both superfluous and confusing in an antitrust case, where the courts correctly search for a 'relevant market'--that 
is, a market relevant to the particular legal issue being litigated.""); U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc., 7 F.3d at 995 (noting that the process 
for defining a submarket is the same as that for defining a market). In the hope of dispensing with this confusion, only the terms 
""relevant market"" and ""relevant product market"" will be used in this discussion. "
302,24," Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981)."
302,25," Lockheed also cites National Reporting Co. v. Alderson Reporting Co. in its argument on this issue. In that case, no court 
specifically addressed the allegations regarding the size of the relevant market because at the district court level the parties 
""basically concurred"" that the market should be limited to the ""geographic market"" of the ""United States Tax Court,"" and the 
Court of Appeals passed over the issue. National Reporting Co., 567 F. Supp 1011, 1019 (E.D. Mo. 1983), rev'd on other 
grounds, 763 F.2d 1020 (8th Cir. 1985). "
306,26," In a criminal section 2 conspiracy case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found there to be no need to allege or prove what 
market the defendants attempted to monopolize, but the opinion is not persuasive. The court wrote that the charge here is conspiracy to monopolize, not monopolization. In a monopolization case the market must be proved. See 
International Boxing Club v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 3 L. Ed. 2d 270, 79 S. Ct. 245. This is because such a charge 
requires a showing of power to exclude competitors, and without an accurate delineation of the market, it is impossible to 
determine the presence or absence of this power. But where the charge is conspiracy to monopolize, the essential element 
is not the power, but the specific intent, to monopolize. Section 2 makes it unlawful ""to conspire to monopolize 'any part' of 
interstate commerce,"" without specifying how large a part must be affected. Hence it is enough if ""some appreciable part of 
interstate commerce is the subject"" of the conspiracy. "
307,," United States v. Consol. Laundries Corp., 291 F.2d 563, 573 (2d Cir. 1961) (internal citations omitted). In Consolidated Laundries Corp., the court contrasted conspiracy to monopolize and monopolization, but the Sherman Act 
provisions regarding those acts both aim to prevent control over only a ""part of trade or commerce,"" which has been defined as 
the relevant product market. The court did not make clear the difference, in the context of a conspiracy claim, between the need 
to allege ""dangerous probability of monopolization,"" which is done by defining the relevant market and alleging defendant's off-
balance market power in that market, and the need to just allege a ""relevant product market."" The law is clear that alleging the 
""dangerous probability of monopolization"" is not required to state a conspiracy claim. Levine, 72 F.3d at 1555-56. The plaintiff 
thus need not allege the defendant's relative market power--how large a part of the trade or commerce defendant intended to 
monopolize. The plaintiff must nevertheless show what part of the trade or commerce defendant had in mind, namely the 
relevant market. To hold otherwise is to hold that section 2 could support liability for conspiring to ""monopolize"" a single 
transaction. Other statutes address unfair trade practices which are illegal regardless of any larger antitrust intent. Antitrust 
statutes, however, cannot be interpreted without reference to their remedial goals."
307,27," Section 1 provides that HN46[
] ""every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2001); see also 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (providing 
for a private right of action and civil damages)."
307,28," The doctrine stated in Copperweld is also sometimes referred to as the ""intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine."" See, e.g., 
Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 783 n.9 (citing articles); Bankers Ins. Co. v. Fla. Residential Prop. & Cas. Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 137 
F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir. 1998). To avoid confusion with the RICO issues presented by Lockheed's Complaint, only the terms 
""intracorporate conspiracy doctrine"" and ""Copperweld doctrine"" will be used in this discussion. "
308,29," It is not clear what the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals means when it uses the term ""agent"" in the context of the Copperweld 
doctrine. If the court means ""agent"" in the traditional sense of agency law, then the allegations do not precisely support Branch's 
falling within the doctrine. See supra note 11 (noting Florida definitions of agency). It would be possible to interpret the Eleventh 
Circuit statements of the doctrine as referring to the traditional understanding of agent, because the court frequently lists the 
term among other parties to specific formal relationships (employees, officers). The actual application of the doctrine in a variety 
of cases, and Copperweld itself, however, show that this interpretation would be too limited. "
322,1," Unless otherwise noted, this fact recitation is culled from the parties' moving papers."
322,2," Fishermen typically enter into market orders with local purchasers prior to leaving port. Before entering into a market order, the 
associations typically require the purchaser to sign an ""Assessment Agreement."" This Agreement includes a clause which 
provides that the purchaser agrees to remit a tax, in addition to the minimum price per pound, to the Association on a regular 
basis. The tax required for Dungeness Crab is three-cents per pound, and is required regardless of whether the fisherman 
selling the crab is a member of the association. The associations will not enter into a market order with the purchaser if it refuses 
to sign the Assessment Agreement."
322,3," If fishermen are unable to reach an agreed upon price for crab at the start of the season, they will keep their boats tied up at 
the dock, resulting in a ""tie-up"" or ""strike."" Plaintiffs argue that tie ups typically occur during the first two weeks of the season, 
from November 15th to December 1st, in order to obtain a higher price for crab and to keep Northern District fishermen from 
fishing. The Northern District consists of District 6, 7, 8, and 9 and runs from Point Arena to the California/Oregon border. District 
10 is immediately south of the Northern District and includes the bays at issue in this case. The Northern District season typically 
opens on December 1st, while the District 10 season opens as early as November 15th."
322,4," The parties use the word ""blackball"" to refer to a situation where members of the associations and other fishermen would 
refuse to sell their crab catch to specific individuals. "
323,5," Plaintiffs erroneously spelled his name ""Wailey"" in their complaint."
323,6," Plaintiffs later recovered a small portion of their gear. They made an effort to fish with the crab pots that remained, but were 
unable to reach their anticipated income for the crab season."
323,7," The log book for the San Mateo Harbor District at Pillar Point, dated November 17, 2001, states, ""Fisherman approached the 
office asking to use the end of pier to block Dooly [sic] from offloading."" The log further states on November 18, 2001, ""Duncan 
asked to tie FV Barbara Faye to load crab gear--gave permission--but now think he just wants to make it difficult for FV Caitlin 
Ann to tie there."""
323,8," Similar events occurred with respect to Richard Axelson, a fisherman who had agreed to fish for Bodega Bay Fish Company 
during the 2001 tie-up. The company refused to purchase Axelson's crab after being threatened by members of the FMABB. 
Axelson had seventy of his crab pots cut. Later in the season, J&S purchased approximately 6,000 lbs. of crab from Axelson, 
which he placed into a tank. That night someone disabled J&S' circulating seawater system causing the crab in the tank to die. 
Shach also found a note on his truck stating: ""It's not over."""
323,9," Throughout their papers, John Morgan and the Morgan Fish Company, Inc. refer to themselves as the ""Morgan defendants."" 
They have not indicated that Morgan Fish Company, Inc. should be treated as anything other than the alter ego of John Morgan. 
Thus, for purposes of this motion, the court treats John Morgan and the Morgan Fish Company, Inc. as a single defendant. "
324,10, Section 1962(c) provides: 
325,," It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities which affect, 
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs 
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
325,18," U.S.C. § 1962(c). ""Person"" is defined broadly under the statute to include ""any individual or entity capable of holding a legal 
or beneficial interest in property."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3)."
325,11," Members of the associations sell crab at a fixed price through market orders issued by the associations. The market order 
states the agreed-upon or ""ex-vessel"" price set by the associations. "
326,12," In full, the Hobbs Act provision at issue states: HN8[
] Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or 
commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical 
violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be 
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both."
326,18, U.S.C. § 1951(a). 
327,13," Plaintiffs also argue that other predicate acts support their claim. Plaintiffs allege that defendants boycotted Three Captains 
because Three Captains purchased crab from Dooley; that defendants cut crab pot lines belonging to Axelson; that defendants 
sabotaged the catch purchased by J&S; that defendants coordinated strikes designed to keep boats from the North out of 
District 10; that defendants refused to terminate a strike even though buyers offered a price acceptable to the fishermen; that 
defendants slashed a fisherman's tires in retaliation for fishing during a strike; that defendants vandalized Schach's vehicle; and 
that defendants threatened to blow-up Schach's car if he purchased ""scab crab."" Plaintiffs do not allege that any particular 
defendants committed these acts. They merely state that ""defendants"" engaged in such acts. These aallegations are insufficient 
to constitute predicate acts for purposes of RICO because plaintiffs have not produced any evidence showing that these 
defendants or which defendants committed these acts. "
328,14," While plaintiffs have presented evidence that Jim Salter, Michael McHenry, and Todd Whaley committed a single predicate 
act, in order to be liable under section 1962(c), each of these defendants must have committed at least two predicate acts within 
ten years. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). "
329,15," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides a private right of action for violations of section 2 and allows the plaintiff, in such an 
action, to recover treble damages. 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
330,16," A market share of less than 50% in an actual monopolization case, and a market share of less than 30% in an attempted 
monopolization case, will generally be deemed insufficient. Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1438. "
332,17," Because the court concludes that a reasonable factfinder could find that defendants' acts were per se illegal, the court need 
not engage in a ""rule of reason"" analysis. See Local 36 of Int'l Fishermen & Allied Workers of America, 177 F.2d at 331. The 
court notes in addition that plaintiffs have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact under the rule of reason analysis, 
because a jury could conclude that defendants' anticompetitive conduct restrained competition within the relevant market. See 
Thurman Indus., 875 F.2d at 1373; Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs, 924 F.2d at 1489."
332,18," Other cases have also held that associations of fishermen that combined to fix the price of fish violated section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See e.g., Hinton v. Columbia River Packers Ass'n, Inc., 131 F.2d 88, 89 (9th Cir. 1942) (holding that a union of 
fishermen violated section 1 by combining to fix the price of fish and control the sale of fish because such actions deprived 
consumers of ""the advantages which accrue to them from free competition in the market""); Manaka v. Monterey Sardine Ind., "
333,," Inc., 41 F. Supp. 531, 534 (N.D. Cal. 1941) (Fee, J.) (holding that an association of sardine fishermen could be held liable under 
the antitrust laws for fixing the price at which sardines were to be sold and excluding non-local competitors from the market)."
333,19," Defendants claim that they are not liable under section 1 of the Sherman Act because the activity of the associations should 
be considered the activity of a single firm under the Fisherman's Collective Marketing Act (""FCMA""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 521-22. 
Defendants cite Maryland and Virginia Producers Assoc., Inc. v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 4 L. Ed. 2d 880, 80 S. Ct. 847 
(1960), for the proposition that they should not be liable under that Act. While that Act does give individual fishermen joining in a 
cooperative or association the same rights as other business entities, it does not provide them with immunity for antitrust 
violations. Maryland and Virginia Producers Assoc., 362 U.S. at 466-67 (""In the event that associations authorized by this bill 
shall do anything forbidden by the Sherman Antitrust Act, they will be subject to the penalties imposed by that law.""). Nor does it 
allow them to join collectively so as to use a monopoly position to suppress competition. Id. at 472 (""We hold that the privilege 
the Capper-Volstead Act grants producers to conduct their affairs collectively does not include a privilege to combine with 
competitors so as to use a monopoly position as a lever further to suppress competition by and among independent producers 
and processors.""); see also Hinton v. Columbia River Packers Ass'n, Inc., 131 F.2d 88, 89 (9th Cir. 1942) (holding that fishermen 
acting together as a union to fix prices were not exempt from section 1 of the Sherman Act by virtue the FCMA). "
335,20," In defendants' opposition papers, HMBFMA states that it no longer intends to pursue its claim that Dooley fished in a wantonly 
wasteful and destructive manner in 1999 or that he threatened to harm and actually did harm defendants' fishing gear by 
trawling of the coast off Central California. "
336,21," In their moving papers, counterdefendants argued that any below cost sales were made in a good faith effort to meet the price 
of competitors. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17050(d). The Court need not address this defense in light of the conclusion that 
HMBFMA has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with regard to its predatory pricing claim."
336,22," Section 17200 also prohibits unfair business practices. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. HMBFMA has not demonstrated that 
counterdefendants' conduct was unfair within the meaning of the statute because they have not presented any evidence that 
counterdefendants' alleged procuring of a permit or transferring of that permit threatened an incipient violation of the antitrust 
laws or violated the policy or spirit of the law in a way that is comparable to a violation of the law or otherwise significantly 
threatened or harmed competition. See Cel-Tech Communications, Inc., 20 Cal. 4th at 187."
336,23," It is undisputed that the Caitlin Ann had a Dungeness crab permit, issued by the Department of Fish and Game, for 1999, 
2000 and 2001. Dooley Decl., Exh. 1."
336,24," As this court noted in its prior order: To the extent HMBFMA alleges that counterdefendants' crab fishing without a valid permit was an unlawful business 
practice, this is not a separate cognizable claim. Section 8280.1 does not prohibit fishing for crab with a vessel that has a 
trawl net. The unlawful business practice at issue is procuring a permit for a vessel that at the time has a trawl net, in 
violation of section 8280.1. "
337,25," Defendants have also failed to present any evidence of damages resulting from plaintiffs' alleged violation of section 17200 
that would be compensable under the UCA. "
351,1," The record on Defendants' Motion consists of excerpts of depositions of Plaintiff's President, Defendants' employees, three 
Federal Aviation Administration officials, and three other witnesses with experience in the hot air balloon industry. Defendants 
have submitted excerpts of their hot air balloon maintenance manuals, some correspondence between the FAA and a third party 
(Ronald DiGiovanni), a recent company newsletter, and a letter subsequently sent to the newsletter's mailing list that listed 
corrections to the newsletter. Defendants also have filed two affidavits both sworn by Mark West, President of Aerostar. Plaintiff 
has submitted an actuarial-economic consultants' report. Plaintiff has not filed any affidavit."
351,2," Mr. Harrison has been involved in aviation for several decades. He holds a variety of licenses and certifications qualifying him 
to fly hot air balloons and fixed wing aircraft. Mr. Harrison is a former flight engineer and co-pilot for Eastern Airlines. He is a 
licensed FAA Airframe and Powerplant mechanic with inspection authority. This certification authorizes him to perform 
maintenance work on many types of aircraft, including hot air balloons. He served ten years as an accident prevention counselor 
and designated pilot examiner. (Harrison Dep., Defs.' Ex. B, at 12-16; Defs.' Undisputed Facts P3.) "
352,3," Although no suggestion has been made that Aerostar and Raven have conspired to violate the antitrust laws, the Court notes 
that HN1[
] a parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring with each other for antitrust 
purposes. Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)."
352,4, The regulations cited within this section have been in effect since 1980 or earlier. 
353,5," The aircraft manufacturer holds the ""type certificate"" for the aircraft, which constitutes the FAA's approval of the design of the 
aircraft. (Pl.'s Undisputed Facts P49.) The FARs establish the procedure for securing type certification for new aircraft designs, 
from the manufacturer's own analysis and testing of the design to the FAA's review of those engineering data before determining 
airworthiness. 14 C.F.R §§ 21.11-21.53. ""Every aircraft that's out there with an airworthiness that's flying around needs to be 
type certificated or receive a type certificate from the FAA, essentially saying that the design complies with the airworthiness 
regulation."" (Michalik Dep., Pl.'s Ex. D & Defs.' Ex. G, at 9.) "
354,6," Robert Waligunda was a distributor for Defendants for a number of years. Defendants terminated him allegedly because he 
""blew the whistle"" regarding Defendants' purportedly deceptive manual. (Waligunda Dep., Pl.'s Ex. F, at 66.) Mr. Waligunda is an 
experienced hot air balloonist, having been involved in the industry for thirty-five years and having logged over 5000 hours in 
flight. (Id. at 19-20.)"
354,7," Mr. Waligunda testified that sometime before May 1982, concerned that its competitors would produce replacement envelopes 
for Raven balloons, Raven allegedly ""made [its] manual stronger"" by seemingly telling Raven owners that they had to buy Raven 
fabric exclusively. (Waligunda Dep., Pl.'s Ex. F, at 17-19.) Because only the manual's ICA portion was changed - a non-
mandatory section - Raven knew that its customers would remain technically free to purchase third-party parts; Raven allegedly 
hoped, though, that the limitation would appear mandatory to the uneducated person. (Id. at 24.) "
355,8," The Court cites this expert report, which is not sworn testimony but is undisputed in the record, to connect Plaintiff's retired ""Big 
Ride"" balloon to Defendants. The parties have not identified - and the Court has not located - any sworn testimony that links 
Plaintiff's balloon with Defendants. "
356,9," In 1994, Ron DiGiovanni started Custom Nine Designs, a competitor of Defendants authorized by the FAA to sell replacement 
fabric for certain balloons manufactured by Defendants. (Waligunda Dep., Pl.'s Ex. F, at 26.) The record includes excerpts of Mr. 
DiGiovanni's deposition."
356,10," Head Balloons joined the market in approximately 1984. (West Aff. of Nov. 2003 P13.) Head Balloons, run by Tarp Head and 
based in Georgia, has an STC to produce replacement fabric. (Waligunda Dep., Pl.'s Ex. F, at 21-22.) There is no testimony in 
the record from Head Balloons."
356,11," According to Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts, ""[Mr.] Harrison has testified that he did not realize that he was not 
required to use Aerostar fabric until [Mr.] DiGiovanni told him about the result in Braden's [Balloons]."" (Id. P84.) Braden's 
Balloons is discussed below at Section II.C.3. However, the Court notes that Plaintiff fails to cite any testimonial evidence 
supporting this contention, and upon independently reviewing the excerpts of Mr. Harrison's depositions submitted to the Court, 
the Court concludes that the record does not support this assertion. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the relevant date for 
purposes of this Motion, as discussed below in the ""Statute of Limitations"" section, is the date on which Defendants removed 
their allegedly restrictive ICA language and not the date on which Plaintiff actually learned about third-party fabric alternatives."
356,12," The parties dispute whether Raven's decision conflicted with a gentlemen's agreement among balloon manufacturers not to 
produce replacement parts for a competitor's product. (Pl.'s Mem. at 5; Defs.' Reply Mem. at 4; see also Waligunda Dep., Pl.'s 
Ex. F, at 13.) "
357,13, See supra text accompanying note 7.
357,14," It appears obvious that the two sentences in this paragraph are contradictory. In 1995, the second sentence of this paragraph 
was changed to read, ""In the event that non-Aerostar repair materials are obtained elsewhere, the supplying company or the 
repair station performing the repair must act to 'certify' the material and part as equal to or better than the original equipment."" 
(West Aff. of Nov. 2003 P9 & Ex. B.) Even with the correction, these two sentences remain contradictory. "
359,15, See supra text accompanying note 11. 
361,16," In either 1999 or 2000, Defendants published their testing standards for fabric in their manual. (West Dep., Pl.'s Ex. G, at 131.) 
Defendants started subjecting competitors' fabric along with their own to these newly announced testing standards, and 
published the results in a newsletter mailed to Raven/Aerostar owners in either 1999 or 2000. (Id.) A typo in the newsletter 
misrepresented the results for fabric produced by Ron DiGiovanni and Custom Nine Designs and indicated that that fabric is 
unsafe for use with Raven/Aerostar balloons. Defendants claims they corrected any error by subsequently mailing a correction 
letter to the same mailing list three months later. (West Aff. of Jan. 2004 P5.) "
363,17," As explained above at pages 7-8, a hot air balloon envelope can only be repaired with FAA approved replacement parts 
(fabric falls under the category of ""parts"") from either: (a) the manufacturer of the product; (b) the holder of a Supplemental Type 
Certificate (""STC""); or (c) an entity with Parts Manufacturing Approval (""PMA""). 14 C.F.R. § 21.303. "
365,18," Had Plaintiff repaired its ""big ride"" balloon, the balloon would have remained aloft and commercially viable until 2006, its next 
anticipated repair date. Plaintiff has submitted an expert report that details the company's economic losses following the 
retirement of its ""big ride"" balloon. (Actuarial-Economic Consultants Report, Pl.'s Ex. A.) "
368,19," Regarding Defendants' implied immunity defense, the parties have not cited any Third Circuit precedent, as the Third Circuit 
has apparently not yet addressed under what circumstances in the aviation context a defendant would be entitled to implied 
immunity from the federal antitrust laws. "
371,20," The most notable example of this behavior was the September 7, 2000 letter Defendants mailed to their hot air balloon 
customers in the wake of the Braden's Balloons litigation, in which Defendants wrote, in pertinent part: We have been in contact with various offices within the FAA and have their full agreement, based on the FAR's and the 
requirements within the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet that ""all inspections, repairs, and replacements must be 
accomplished in accordance with the latest issue of Aerostar Instructions for Continued Airworthiness."" (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Summ. J. at 15, emphasis removed; see also supra p. 19.) "
372,21," Plaintiff also alleges attempted monopolization. HN23[
] In order to prevail on an attempted monopolization claim under the 
Sherman Act, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant (1) engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) specific 
intent to monopolize and with (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. See, e.g., Armstrong Surgical Ctr., Inc. 
v. Armstrong County Mem'l Hosp., 185 F.3d 154, 157 (3d Cir. 1999). In order to determine whether there exists a dangerous 
probability of achieving monopoly power, a court must inquire ""into the relevant product and geographic market and the 
defendant's economic power in that market."" Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 442 (3d Cir. 1997) 
(quoting Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993)). In light of the Court's 
disposition of Plaintiff's monopolization claim, the Court need not separately consider the claim of attempted monopolization."
372,22," There are many cases in which other district courts have found replacement markets limited to the products of a single 
supplier where they are unique and have no reasonably interchangeable substitutes. See, e.g., U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule 
Indus., 7 F.3d 986, 997-98 (11th Cir. 1993) (considerably more expensive anchor excluded from broader market of functionally 
interchangeable but up to 50 less expensive anchors), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1221, 114 S. Ct. 2710, 129 L. Ed. 2d 837 (1994); 
Woods Exploring & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 438 F.2d 1286, 1305-07 (5th Cir. 1971) (concluding that single 
natural gas field constituted relevant market), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972); Hewlett-
Packard Co. v. Arch Assocs. Corp., 908 F. Supp. 265, 270 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (complaint adequately pleaded relevant product 
market, even where market limited to distribution of Hewlett-Packard computer printers); Nat'l Communications Ass'n, Inc. v. 
AT&T Co., 808 F. Supp. 1131, 1135 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (denying motion to dismiss because HN24[
] ""a monopolist, or person 
attempting to monopolize, can be found liable in regard to distribution of its own product if it is (1) illegally attempting to destroy 
competition by refusing to deal or (2) controlling an essential service or bottleneck""). "
373,23, There does not appear to be any dispute that the geographic market is the entire United States. 
375,24," The Court notes some pleading issues relating to the tying claims in Plaintiff's complaint. In paragraph 4, Plaintiff asserts that it 
brings this case ""by reason of Defendants' violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1."" Because Plaintiff has cited both 
Sections 1and 2 in his complaint, and given the requirements of liberal construction of pleadings under the Federal Rules, the 
Court will consider Plaintiff's tying claims as brought under both Sections 1and 2."
375,25," In Plaintiff's brief on the Kodak issue, the Plaintiff also seeks to cite Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14, as support for 
the tying claim. However, because there is no mention of Section 3 of the Clayton Act in Plaintiff's complaint, the Court will, 
therefore, not consider it. However, this is not prejudicial to Plaintiff as such a statutory basis for a tying claim would be 
redundant to the claims stated under Sections 1and 2 of the Sherman Act. "
376,26," It is important to note that in Kodak the plaintiffs did not allege that the tying product was Kodak copiers, but alleged that 
service and parts are two distinct markets, and that Kodak had used its monopoly power over the parts market as the tying 
product, to compel the owners and users of Kodak equipment to use Kodak's own service personnel, rather than ISOs. "
377,27," There is a certain inconsistency in Plaintiff's definitions. If Defendants indeed have a monopoly of the replacement fabric 
market, as alleged in Count I for monopolization purposes, it is hard to understand how Defendants would need the help of a 
""tie"", i.e., the forced sale of replacement fabric, as a ""tied"" product. However, inconsistent contentions, particularly in the 
summary judgment context, are not fatal. "
391,1," Trigon Healthcare was recently purchased by Anthem Healthcare, an Indiana based health insurance company. To be 
consistent with the district court's usage and the factual record developed below, we refer to the corporation as ""Trigon."" "
392,2," We refer to the appellants, the American Chiropractic Association, the Virginia Chiropractic Association, certain individual 
chiropractors and some patients of individual chiropractors, collectively as ""American Chiropractic."""
392,3," Spinal manipulation is defined by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a division of the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, as ""manual therapy in which loads are applied to the spine using short or long lever methods."" (J.A. at 
5507.)"
392,4," The use of chiropractors by Trigon's plan enrollees has increased substantially since Trigon began covering chiropractic care. 
For instance, in 1996 only 26,275 plan enrollees received spinal manipulation treatment from chiropractors, but that number 
jumped to 74,477 by 2001. The number of chiropractic providers in Trigon's network rose from 513 to 961 during the same time 
span, and now almost 90% of chiropractors in the Commonwealth of Virginia are in Trigon's provider network. In addition, the 
total amount of payments from Trigon to chiropractors rose from $ 12,380,737 in 1996 to $ 21,510,503 in 2001."
392,5, This organization is now called Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association of America. 
393,6," Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that the boycott ended in 1980, it affirmed a grant of injunctive relief against the 
American Medical Association because some of its actions in 1983 ""indicated the AMA's likelihood of returning to its old (anti-
chiropractic) ways."" Wilk v. Am. Medical Ass'n., 895 F.2d 352, 367 (7th Cir. 1990)."
393,7," The complaint initially named Blue Cross & Blue Shield of America in addition to Trigon Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliated 
companies. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of America was voluntarily dismissed as a defendant by American Chiropractic. "
394,8," We note that American Chiropractic does not appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment on its § 2 Sherman Act 
claim (count two) or the state law breach of contract claim (count six)."
394,9," Because the state law conspiracy claims follow the same analysis as the § 1 claim, we do not address them separately. See 
Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. Historic Green Springs, Inc., 307 F.3d 277, 284 (4th Cir. 2002) HN2[
] (noting that the Virginia Civil Conspiracy Act does not create liability absent a violation of the federal antitrust laws); Fox v. Deese, 234 Va. 412, 362 S.E. 2d 
699, 708, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1248 (Va. 1987) (adopting intracorporate immunity doctrine for Virginia conspiracy laws)."
394,10," These organizations include the Virginia Society of Internal Medicine, the Medical Society of Virginia, the American College of 
Physicians, the University of Virginia School of Medicine, the Eastern Virginia Medical School and other medical organizations. "
395,11, NSAIDs is an abbreviation for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen.
395,12," It is unclear whether Dr. Colley was stating that the Low Back Guideline was a referral guideline, or if he was referencing one 
of the other guidelines before the Managed Care Advisory Panel. Because this fact does not affect our analysis on American 
Chiropractic's Section 1 claim, we will assume that Dr. Colley was referencing the Low Back Guideline."
395,13, American Chiropractic did not argue that Trigon conspired with its own employees serving on the MCAP. 
396,14," A lawsuit alleging a conspiracy between a hospital and its peer review committee currently would be barred under the Health 
Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 11101-11152 (West 1995 & Supp. 2003). That Act was passed after the 
filing of Oksanen's lawsuit and was not made retroactive to pending cases. "
398,15," Limited-license providers are defined by Trigon to include chiropractors, speech therapists, occupational therapists and 
physical therapists. "
399,16," American Chiropractic also limited its arguments to direct evidence of a conspiracy before the district court, but that court 
found that American Chiropractic offered no direct evidence of a conspiracy and instead analyzed whether there was 
circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy."
399,17," Because we find that American Chiropractic failed to prove the existence of an anticompetitive conspiracy, we do not consider 
whether American Chiropractic entered sufficient evidence that Trigon and the medical associations and medical doctors 
implemented unreasonable restraints on trade. "
400,18," Because we conclude that American Chiropractic lacked a valid business expectancy, we do not address the district court's 
alternative ground for granting summary on this claim - that Trigon did not use improper means in interfering with the 
chiropractors' alleged business expectancy. "
401,19," The provision at issue in A & E Supply read that ""no order of the Commission under this article shall in any way relieve or 
absolve any person affected by such order from any liability under any other laws of this Commonwealth."" A & E Supply Co. v. 
Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 674 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1986) (quoting Va. Code Ann. § 38.1-57.1))."
401,20," As discussed infra, in its RICO claim, American Chiropractic alleged that Trigon engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity 
including mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion. "
402,21," The district court relied heavily on Ambrose v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Va., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 1153 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd 
95 F.3d 41 (4th Cir. 1996) (unpublished per curiam opinion). Because Ambrose was decided before the Supreme Court's 
decision in Humana, Inc. v. Forsyth, 525 U.S. 299, 142 L. Ed. 2d 753, 119 S. Ct. 710 (1999), and because the district court in 
Ambrose applied different definitions for the statutory terms than did the Humana Court, that decision is not helpful to our 
decision today. "
403,22," For example, in this case American Chiropractic asserted state law claims for tortious interference with a business 
relationship, common law and statutory conspiracy, and breach of contract."
403,23," American Chiropractic also alleged the predicate act of securities fraud in its complaint, but it did not pursue that claim 
because Trigon previously had not been convicted of securities fraud, as required by 18 U.S.C.A. § 1964(c) (West 2000). "
404,24, The RBRVS is the relative value scale used by Medicare in setting its reimbursement rates for providers under that program.
404,25," At oral argument before this court, counsel for American Chiropractic also alleged that Trigon committed mail fraud by telling 
its plan enrollees that healthcare providers were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare rates. The district court previously had 
held that American Chiropractic lacked standing to advance the claims of individual patients, and American Chiropractic did not 
appeal that ruling. Thus, the argument that Trigon committed mail fraud against its enrollees is not properly before this court. "
405,26," American Chiropractic raises four other arguments relating to the conduct of discovery. Those arguments are that the district 
court abused its discretion by: (1) failing to require Trigon to produce the identity of all medical doctors employed by Trigon; (2) 
refusing to compel Trigon to turn over information regarding any service code that paid a lower reimbursement amount to 
limited-license practitioners than to medical doctors; (3) by refusing to compel Trigon to turn over more of Dr. Colley's file; and 
(4) by refusing to allow American Chiropractic to conduct another Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. We have examined these issues 
carefully and conclude that they are without merit; thus, we affirm those rulings as well."
405,27," The parties agreed that this time limit could be revised by negotiations in good faith if American Chiropractic could show a 
valid basis for requesting additional information. "
406,28," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) provides that HN39[
] ""[s] hould it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing [a 
summary judgment] motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavits facts essential to justify the party's 
opposition, the court may …order a continuance to permit …discovery to be had."" "

Inc. v. Beecham Group PLC, Civil Action No. 03-10506-WGY], present action is now sufficiently advanced to counsel against "

438,6," In its separate action, Eon asserted that it could have filed its abbreviated new drug application as early as December 24, 1996. 
Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 74] P 51. Yet in support of this assertion, Eon explained only that SmithKline's ""sham Orange Book listing 
[of the '639 patent]"" and ""malicious Sham Infringement Action"" resulted in thirty-month stay periods (the earliest of which was 
triggered in September 1997), and a subsequent 180-day ""Generic Exclusivity Period"" (which was triggered in August 2001). 
See id. PP 29, 51-54. Neither of these periods account for the fact that the first applications, filed not by Eon, but by Copley and 
Teva, were not filed until August 1997. See Compl. P 52(a)-(b). "
440,7," Mullenix contrasts the ""nuanced"" approach of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits with the ""restrictive"" rule observed by other courts, 
which ""prevents review of [all] standing challenges prior to the class certification decision."" Mullenix, supra. Because this Court 
finds deferral of SmithKline's standing challenge appropriate even under the approach of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, it need 
not address this distinction. "
441,8," The Court notes that Valley Drug identified a conflict between direct purchasers who benefit from generic delay versus those 
who were injured, a conflict arguably different from -- and more serious than -- that between end payors who were not injured by 
generic delay versus those who were. Indeed, in contrast to the direct purchasers ofValley Drug, the end payor plaintiffs here 
might be characterized as uniformly ""not benefitted."" Yet this superficial uniformity would not imply uniformity of economic 
interests. With respect to settlement, for example, an uninjured end payor might be willing to accept a far lesser sum than would 
an injured end payor with an entirely different economic situation. "
443,9," The Court could imagine, for example, discounting the damages to account for the probability of non-switching."
443,10," The Court assumes that consumers who continued to choose Relafen in the actual world would have done so in the but-for 
world -- that is, even if generic nabumetone had become available in August 1998 rather than August 2001. This assumption is 
continued purchasing Relafen after generic entry, but only because they were reluctant to switch after starting treatment with the 
branded drug. Had generic alternatives been available earlier, such consumers might have started with and continued 
purchasing generic nabumetone rather than Relafen. The Court nevertheless excludes such consumers because identifying 
them would require the sort of individualized inquiries that would render class certification inappropriate. See Cardizem, 200 
F.R.D. at 343 (distinguishing between switchers, for whom ""there is no need for individual analysis of switching behavior,"" and 
non-switchers, for whom there is such a need); cf. Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 242, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978 
(1988) (recognizing that requiring proof of an individualized issue such as reliance ""effectively would have prevented 
respondents from proceeding with a class action, since individual issues then would have overwhelmed the common ones"")."
443,11," A similar analysis applies to consumers who purchased only generic nabumetone. See Defs.' Proposed Order Opp'n at 4. 
Consumers whose costs varied according to the price of generic nabumetone were injured by what the end payor plaintiffs 
allege were artificially inflated prices. See End Payor Pls.' Mem. at 1. Consumers whose costs did not vary according to the price 
of generic nabumetone were not injured and were accordingly excluded from the end payor plaintiff classes."
443,12," Under this test, patients who were first prescribed Relafen after August 1998 -- the date of generic entry in the but-for world -- 
were not excluded from the end payor plaintiff classes. That these patients might not have been prescribed Relafen in the but-for 
world, see Defs.' Opp'n at 19 (asserting a probable decline in prescriptions because SmithKline would have ceased its promotion "
444,," of Relafen upon generic entry), does not change the fact that they were prescribed Relafen in the actual world and therefore 
suffered economic injury. "
445,13," In a more recent decision, the Supreme Court explained, consistent with the Third Circuit's view, that the indirect purchaser 
rule is applied to claims for money damages to ""eliminate the complications of apportioning overcharges,"" ""eliminate multiple 
recoveries,"" and ""promote the vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws."" Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 208, 
212, 214, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 2807 (1990). "
448,14," One of the cases consolidated in this action was transferred from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, see Twin Cities Bakery 
Workers Health & Welfare Fund v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., No. 02-CV-985 (E.D. Pa. filed 2002), and therefore requires 
application of Pennsylvania's choice of law rules. see van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 639, 11 L. Ed. 2d 945, 84 S. Ct. 805 
(1964)."
448,15," The fact that the exemplar states have recognized indirect purchaser actions brings the present claims out from under ""the 
long shadow of Illinois Brick."" Terazosin, 160 F. Supp. 2d at 1372. Unlike states that have adopted the Illinois Brick prohibition, 
the exemplar states have not expressed a policy against indirect purchaser actions that might otherwise be undermined by the 
end payor plaintiffs' present claims."
448,16," See Cole v. Hewlett Packard Co., 84 P.3d 1047, 2004 WL 376471, at *6 (Kan. App. 2004) (unpublished table decision) 
(""Based on the plain wording of K.S.A. 2003 Supp. 50-624(j), Cole, the consumer, did not need to deal directly with HP, the "
449,," supplier, for the sale of the 882C printer in order for her and HP to be involved in a consumer transaction. As a result, this 
transaction falls within the KCPA [Kansas Consumer Protection Act]."")."
449,17," To be sure, there are variations in states' definitions of unjust enrichment. As examples, SmithKline cites differences in the 
conduct required and the availability of equitable defenses. See Defs.' Opp'n at 31-32. Yet with the exception of the variation 
discussed below, see Section III.E.1.b.v, infra, such differences prove largely irrelevant. As the end payor plaintiffs note, the 
conflict between states that require illegal conduct and those that do not is ""immaterial … because Plaintiffs here do allege 
unlawful conduct."" End Payor Pls.' Reply at 32. Similarly, although states may ""vary significantly in the requirements necessary 
to establish the defense [of unclean hands],"" Lilly v. Ford Motor Co., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5698, No. 00 C 7372, 2002 WL 
507126, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 3, 2002) (citation omitted), there is no suggestion here that SmithKline could establish any set of 
relevant requirements. "
451,18," Certainly, the denials of certification also reflect other factors. See e.g., Gordon, 2001 WL 366432, at *6 (considering prior 
denials ""different,"" not only because those plaintiffs lacked workable methods for calculating damages, but also because they 
had sued more defendants, bought more products, and made more purchases). The Court simply notes that views regarding 
antitrust policies and proof are among the relevant factors, and in some cases, are the most significant among them. See A & M 
Supply, 252 Mich. App. at 633, 642 (finding certification inappropriate on facts ""virtually identical"" to those of Gordon based on a 
more skeptical review of the evidence). "
453,19," In so excluding the Kansas plaintiffs, the Court makes no comment on the validity of the end payor plaintiffs' previously 
asserted claim of fraudulent concealment. See Relafen, 286 F. Supp. 2d at 64 n.4. It merely finds the claim inappropriate for 
class treatment. "
454,20," Although Tennessee courts have required that unjust enrichment plaintiffs first exhaust their legal remedies, see Paschall's 
Inc. v. Dozier, 219 Tenn. 45, 57-58, 407 S.W.2d 150 (1966), such exhaustion would be futile here as the Tennessee plaintiffs' 
statutory claims are not cognizable under the state's antitrust or consumer protection laws. "
456,21," In an unpublished opinion, the Fourth Circuit suggested that on different facts, North Carolina courts adopt ""a broader 
approach to unjust enrichment than is indicated by Effler's 'direct benefit' rule."" Metric Constructors, Inc. v. Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi, Ltd., 72 Fed. Appx. 916, 921 (4th Cir. 2003). This Court makes no comment on the end payor plaintiffs' ability to 
distinguish the present facts from those of Effler. It merely concludes that any attempt to do so would be inappropriate for 
consideration in the present class action. The Court also notes that citation of unpublished opinions is disfavored in the Fourth 
Circuit. See 4th Cir. R. 36(c). "
466,1," The District of Puerto Rico revised, reorganized, and renumbered its compendium of local rules in September of 2003. 
Because the summary judgment motions in this case were adjudicated prior thereto, we refer throughout to the earlier version."
466,2," To be sure, the district court also denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the basis of the plaintiff's supposed 
noncompliance, qua movant, with the requirements of D.P.R.R. 311.12. See Euromodas, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 204 n.5 (refusing to 
""scavenge through the record to pinpoint the facts that would support Euromodas's arguments""). But as our subsequent 
discussion of the merits reveals, see infra Part III, any error in that regard was harmless. Accordingly, we discuss only the district 
court's treatment of the plaintiff's opposition. "
467,3," The current iteration of this obligation, codified in Local Rule 56(c), is worded somewhat differently. We take no view as to what 
that language requires. See supra note 1. "
468,4," HN10[
] The fact that the plaintiff had cross-moved for summary judgment does not alter this methodology. In that 
circumstance, a reviewing court examines each motion independently, applying the principles articulated above. See Blackie v. 
Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996)."
468,5," It is abundantly clear that this special constraint -- limiting inferences from ambiguous evidence -- applies in vertical restraint 
cases. See, e.g., Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64. The proposition may be less clear in horizontal conspiracy contexts, but we 
need not probe that distinction here. "
472,6," Because we have upheld the entry of summary judgment for the defendants, it would be an empty exercise to probe the 
circumstances surrounding the denial of the plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment. We caution, however, that we 
express no opinion on the district court's reasoning in that regard. See Euromodas, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 204 n.5. "

482,4," While the statute as it existed in 1907 was not known as the TTPA, the essential language of the statute has not changed since

498,1," ""Defendant"" shall refer to Soriano."
498,2," Defendant's position title at IGH is also referred to as ""division chair."" The terms ""division chair"" and ""chief"" are

500,3," After the recommendation of the department and division chairs, an application proceeds 1) to the credentials committee for a 
recommendation to 2) the medical executive committee for a recommendation to 3) the board of trustees, which makes the final 
decision. At the time of plaintiff's application, defendant was not only the division chair but also a member of the medical 
executive committee as well as a member of the board of trustees. "
501,4," This attorney indicated at trial that when defendant called him, he told him that a reasonable way to verify the information he 
had received about plaintiff would be to request a list of his cases for the prior two years. If any case raised a question, then the 
hospital could request specific medical records. Since the attorney was not admitted as an expert on any issue, the judge 
considered this testimony only for the limited purpose of determining whether defendant had acted out of malice. "
502,5, Mortality refers to a patient's death; morbidity refers to complications. Every mortality is discussed at conference. 
504,6," Plaintiff claimed that the defamatory comments referred to in his original complaint, filed in September 1996, were the ones 
made by defendant in his October 25, 1995, letter to plaintiff, which was copied to Tiu. It was not until October 1996, when 
plaintiff received minutes of the MEC meeting, that plaintiff discovered what defendant had said about him at the meeting. Those 
statements were the subject of plaintiff's amended complaint, filed in August 1997."
504,7," On December 5, 1996, plaintiff deposed Syracuse. A few days later, plaintiff received a letter from Dr. Richard A. Kaiser, the 
head of surgery at Mountainside, advising him that Mountainside had decided to review ""selected vascular surgical cases"" 
involving plaintiff's patients at that hospital. "
505,8," As of trial, most of plaintiff's practice was at Valley."
505,9," Defendant originally stated the percentage as ten to fifteen percent. Counsel then restated this percentage as five to ten

513,13," HN17[
] The only difference between the federal and state statutes is that the Act does not require that defendant's activity 
affect interstate commerce. Urdinaran, supra, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 492. It is the effect on interstate commerce that supplies the 
necessary federal jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 241, 100

518,14," Although the issue of qualified privilege arose in the context of personal defamation, we discuss the issue of privilege in the

518,15," In the case of a hospital performing its credentialing function on applicants for surgical privileges, these competing interests 
and principles have been codified in both federal and state statutes. See N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-22.10(d); 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 11111 and 
11112(a). "

Service (PP 40-42), ConsoliDate (PP 48-50), Internationalized Domain Names (PP 56-60), and the Incentive Marketing Program 
(P 66). "
524,3," The parties jointly proceed in treating this case under the ""rule of reason"" standard rather than the ""per se"" rule reserved for 
presumptively illegal practices such as price-fixing, and the Court does the same. See McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d

agreement or understanding that such benefit will influence his conduct in relation to his employer's or principal's affairs. N.Y. Penal L. 180.03. "
570,6," Indeed, as we have observed, it remains an open question in this circuit whether commercial bribery can even form the basis of 
a § 2(c) claim. "
571,7," We express no view as to whether the facts contained in plaintiffs' complaint could support a substantive violation of § 2(c) in 
circumstances where a plaintiff alleges that the payments at issue are themselves improper."
571,8," Indeed, it is unclear whether Starwood's status as an agent of the Blue Tree Owners is even relevant to the § 2(c) analysis. 
Section 2(c)'s proscription on payments to agents applies only to ""an agent . . . of any [other] party to [the] transaction."" 15 
U.S.C. § 13(c). The plaintiffs have not alleged that they are parties to the transactions that give rise to the vendor payments. In 
fact, in their complaint they concede that they have ""no involvement in the negotiation and execution of [the] purchasing 
contracts."" Compl. P 25. If in fact Starwood, rather than the Blue Tree Owners, is the ""other party to the transaction,"" then the 
Blue Tree Owners' § 2(c) claim is even more tenuous because they are neither parties to the transaction nor competing 
purchasers."
571,9," We note that even if the Blue Tree Owners had not expressly conceded the propriety of the vendor payments, it is unlikely that 
this pleading deficiency could be cured by amending the complaint: Any assertion in an amended complaint that the vendor 
payments themselves were improper would negate the claim that the Blue Tree Owners, not Starwood, were the rightful 
recipients of the vendor payments. As we have stated, the proscriptions of § 2(c) apply regardless of whether the improper 
payment is made to the purchaser or its agent. See 15 U.S.C. § 13(c). ""It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to pay . . . anything 
of value . . . either to the other party to such transaction or [that party's] agent . . . ."") (emphasis added); see Biddle, 96 F.2d at 
691 (""Congress must have intended that payments by sellers should not be made to buyers through any one acting as agent for 
the buyer. . . . It may not be said that payments to buyers are in any different category than those to agents or those who act for 
or under the control of the buyers.""); see also Fitch, 136 F.2d at 13. Thus, the illegality of the vendor payments would not be 
cured by simply handing them over to the Blue Tree Owners, who have not alleged that they render any services to the vendors. 
Rather, a transfer of the payments from Starwood to the Blue Tree Owners would simply result in the precise ""evil"" Congress 
sought to curb: the practice of vendors paying fees to a ""dummy broker"" - i.e., a buyer's agent - who, in turn, passes the fees 
over to the buyer. See Henry Broch & Co., 363 U.S. at 168-69; Stephen Jay Photography, 903 F.2d at 992 (observing that § 2(c) 
was directed primarily to the practice whereby ""a large buyer with economic clout might insist that in order to do business sellers 
must pay a fee to a designated 'broker' . . . [who] would then turn the money over to the large buyer""). "

620,2," These facts, except where otherwise noted, are undisputed and taken from the opinion of the district court. See Clarett v. Nat'l

owners, presidents and general managers. A memorandum from the Commissioner that accompanied the revised Constitution 
and Bylaws noted that changes had been made to the eligibility rules."
621,8," At oral argument, counsel for Clarett clarified that his challenge is not limited to the ""Special Eligibility"" rule, as his papers on 
appeal might suggest, but extends to any and all of the eligibility rules that would keep Clarett from entering the NFL draft this 
year. We refer to these rules collectively as ""the eligibility rules."" "
622,9," Although Article III, Section 1 of the collective bargaining agreement obligates the NFL to notify the players union of, and to 
bargain over, any change to the Bylaws that ""could significantly affect the terms and conditions"" of players' employment, the 
record is silent as to whether the NFL or the players union considered the changes to Article XII significant, whether the NFL 
notified the players union of these changes, or whether the changes were bargained over."
622,10," Whereas the pre-2003 version of the Constitution and Bylaws authorized special eligibility for players after the passing of 
""three NFL seasons,"" the current eligibility rules as established by the Bylaws and the Commissioner's memorandum require that 
""three full college seasons"" have elapsed. Clarett is neither three NFL seasons nor three college seasons out of high school. 
Because the difference is immaterial for our purposes, we use the less specific ""three football seasons"" when referring to the 
amount of time after graduating high school a player must wait before entering the draft. "
623,11," The statutory exemption, so named because it is derived from the texts of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17, 29 U.S.C. § 52, 
and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., shields from the antitrust laws certain unilateral conduct of labor groups 
such as boycotts and picketing. See H.A. Artists & Assocs., Inc. v. Actors' Equity Ass'n, 451 U.S. 704, 714-15, 68 L. Ed. 2d 558,

Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 (1975), the NFL does not rely on the statutory exemption in arguing that its eligibility rules are 
immune from the antitrust laws. "
625,12," When confronted with allegations that agreements between labor and employers damaged competition in the business or 
product market, we have previously regarded Justice White's decision in Jewel Tea as setting forth the ""classic formulation"" of 
the non-statutory exemption. See Local 210, Laborers' Int'l Union v. Labor Relations Div. Associated Gen. Contractors of Am., 
844 F.2d 69, 79 (2d Cir. 1988); Berman Enterprises, Inc. v. Local 333, United Marine Div., etc.,644 F.2d 930, 935 n. 8 (2d Cir.

elimination of competition among the other employers within the unit with respect to marketing hours,"" Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. at 
688, Justice Goldberg in his concurrence noted that it was conceded on that record that the uniform hours restriction challenged 
in that cases aided ""small employers at the expense of the large,"" id. at 699."
626,14," We are not the only circuit to have drawn this distinction. See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football, 311 U.S. App. D.C. 89, 50 F.3d

must be emphasized that such individual bargaining is not an exercise of a right to free competition under the antitrust laws; 
rather, it is an exercise of a right derived from collective bargaining itself."" Caldwell, 66 F.3d at 528."
630,17," Because we conclude that the eligibility rules are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, we have no occasion to address 
whether, or in what circumstances, the non-statutory exemption extends to permissive bargaining subjects. See Feather v. 
United Mine Workers, 711 F.2d 530, 542 (3d. Cir. 1983) (""[Non-statutory exemption] generally applies when a union, acting with 
a non-labor party, seeks to attain goals which are mandatory or permissive subjects of bargaining under the National Labor 
Relations Act, unless the Union acts with a predatory anti-competitive purpose."" (emphasis added and footnote omitted)). "
632,18," We do not here address whether the district court was correct to regard the non-statutory exemption as an affirmative defense 
for which the defendant bore the burden of proof. Cf. USS-POSCO Indus. v. Contra Costa County Bldg. & Constr. Trades 
Council, 31 F.3d 800, 805 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that although defendants typically bear burden of proving entitlement to 
exception from the antitrust laws, ""statutory exemption is not an affirmative defense"")."
632,19," We therefore need not determine whether as a matter of law the Constitution and Bylaws that contained the eligibility rules 
were incorporated by reference into the current collective bargaining agreement. "

by the patentee. See Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 787-88 (6th Cir. 2002). In fact, Conwood does not 
discuss patent infringement at all. Instead, it analyzes whether tortious acts committed by one competitor against another 
competitor's display racks in retail shops may constitute anticompetitive conduct supporting a Section 2 claim. Masimo tries to 
draw an analogy between its intellectual property and the property (display racks) at [*10]  issue in Conwood, and argues that it 
was the taking of property that created the antitrust violation in Conwood. This analogy is strained and inaccurate. The Conwood 
Court is considering tort, not property, and is not analogous to the case at hand. The Conwood Court's concern was whether the 
Defendant's acts should be considered isolated tortious acts, which would not be an antitrust violation, or an exclusionary 
pattern, which would support an antitrust claim. Conwood does not offer guidance as to whether patent infringement may 
support an antitrust claim. "

651,1," Coldwell Banker initially sought a temporary restraining order (""TRO"") until the Court could rule on its request for a preliminary 
injunction. The parties then agreed to the issuance of a stipulated TRO on March 29, 2004 until the preliminary injunction 
request could be resolved. "
654,2," The Court notes that because of the presence of office exclusive listings and for-sale-by-owner homes, no real estate agents 
have the ability to show all homes in the Des Moines area market. Nevertheless, the homes listed in the MLXchange database 
comprise a substantial portion -- approximately 85 percent -- of the Des Moines area market. Transcript at 58:4-7 (DMAAR sales 
represent 85 percent of the Des Moines area market). "
655,3," The parties disagree as to whether Iowa Realty's Passport Plus homes are properly classified as office exclusive listings. An 
office exclusive listing is one in which a customer directs his or her broker to market the seller's property only to those brokers 
and agents the customer specifically authorizes. Transcript at 170:24-172:1. Coldwell Banker makes several arguments that 
Iowa Realty's Passport Plus listings are not truly office exclusive. Essentially, Coldwell Banker contends that the Passport Plus 
homes cannot be ""office exclusive"" because Iowa Realty shares the listing information with First Realty and thus does not keep 
the listings exclusive to its office. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. As noted above, a realtor will list a property as an 
office exclusive when ""it is the desire of the seller that a listing not be filed with the [MLS]."" Handbook on Multiple Listing Policy 
of the National Association of Realtors, Plaintiff's Appendix II, PX245 at 6-6. It appears under the guidelines that Iowa Realty 
may share the listing with any other realtor, as long as it is authorized by and is the ""desire of"" the seller. In the present case, 
sellers who sign up for the Passport Plus program authorize Iowa Realty and its subsidiaries -- i.e. First Realty -- to market office 
exclusive listings. Defendants' Appendix, Exhibit G at G.021. "
658,4," The Court disagrees for the purposes of this motion only. At later stages in this litigation it may be necessary for the parties to 
revisit both the issue of whether for-sale-by-owner and flat-fee broker homes should be included in the relevant product market 
and whether Iowa Realty's market share should be considered separately or combined with First Realty."
658,5," The parties did not provide data showing Iowa Realty Group's share of the entire relevant product market. However, in 2003 
DMAAR sales accounted for approximately 85 percent of the Des Moines area real estate market, Transcript at 58:4-7, and Iowa 
Realty Group had an approximately 60 percent share of DMAAR sales, Plaintiff's Appendix II, PX64 at IR01436. Even assuming the relevant product market did not include for-sale-by-owner homes, Iowa Realty Group would only have an 
approximately 60 percent share of the market. See generally Transcript at 57:22-58:3 (flat-fee brokers represented 
approximately 2 to 3 percent of the Des Moines area real estate market in 2002), Transcript at 58:4-7, Plaintiff's Appendix II, 
PX64 at IR01436. "
661,6," Nothing in the Court's preliminary injunction order precludes Iowa Realty Group from exercising its termination right under the 
Co-Marketing Agreement pursuant to VII.C. "
670,1," The parties have explained in their joint stipulations that ""crude oil is the raw product from which gasoline is made at a refinery. 
Upstream operations consist of exploring for and producing crude oil, and downstream operations consist of refining crude into 
gasoline and other products and marketing the finished products."""
670,2," Defendants dispute that an ""alliance"" existed and characterize Equilon and Motiva as distinct entities. Appellees' Brief, at 46. 
While the defendant corporations did not create a new legal entity called ""The Alliance,"" the record establishes beyond dispute 
that representatives of Texaco and Shell generally referred to the two joint ventures as part of a single project to combine the 
two companies' nationwide refining and marketing operations. Moreover, the record confirms that the single project was often 
referred to as ""an alliance,"" and frequently called ""The Alliance,"" by representatives of Texaco, Shell, and SRI, and by Board 
Members from the two joint ventures, ""Equilon Enterprises"" (Equilon) and ""Motiva Enterprises"" (Motiva). When we refer to ""the 
alliance,"" we therefore refer to the combined national refining and marketing operation consisting of Equilon and Motiva -- an 
enterprise which was created, developed, and maintained collectively by the individual defendant corporations."
670,3," The district court explained the massive scope of the alliance: ""the downstream assets in Equilon and Motiva include twelve 
refineries, twenty-three lubricant plants, two research laboratories, 22,000 branded service stations, over 24,000 miles of 
pipeline, 107 terminals, and approximately 24,000 employees."" "
671,4," The record does not establish with certainty whether the decision to price the two brands together was actively discussed 
during the SMI. The evidence does show that the SMI included a ""price optimization"" program. And there is some evidence in 
the record that the price optimization program ratified the unofficial decision to move toward unitary pricing -- one witness 
testified that the price optimization program included ""a policy or a procedure to charge the same prices to both -- to similar 
classes of trade in the same marketing areas and to effect those -- to effect those changes."" "
672,5," HN1[
] A ""horizontal agreement [is] 'naked' if it is formed with the objectively intended purpose or likely effect of increasing 
price or decreasing output in the short run, with output measured by quantity or quality."" XI HERBERT HOVENKAMP, 
ANTITRUST LAW P 1905, at 210 (1998) (hereinafter: HOVENKAMP). "
673,6," One board member who represented SRI in Motiva observed that, ""once the Equilon Board takes a position on an issue 
common to both Motiva and Equilon, Shell and Texaco will have a strong desire to have the same action taken in Motiva."" The 
member further stated: "
674,," As is exhibited by Motiva's incorrect reference to the Alliance, rather than Motiva, at the bottom of page 7 and the top of 
page 8 of the attached Business Plan writeup, the 'focus on Motiva' message will have to be repeated often to get it 
accepted. The more we allow ""Alliance"" to dominate, the greater the likelihood that personal behavior will favor ""Alliance"" 
over Motiva and the greater the likelihood that sub-optimizations of Motiva, in favor of the Alliance, will occur. We are on 
alert in this regard but the ""Alliance"" force is a large one."
674,7," The plaintiffs have also suggested that if we reject their per se approach, we should employ the ""quick look"" theory of review to 
find defendants liable. HN7[
] Quick look analysis applies when per se review is inapplicable but when ""an observer with even 
a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question have an anti-competitive effect on 
customers and markets."" California Dental Ass'n v. Federal Trade Commission, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935, 119 S. Ct. 
1604 (1999). As the district court rightly noted, ""much like per se treatment, quick-look analysis applies 'when the great likelihood 
of anticompetitive effects can easily be ascertained.'"" (quoting California Dental, 526 U.S. at 770). Because we hold that the 
plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing with respect to the illegality of the alliance's price fixing system under the per se rule, 
we need not decide whether that scheme would survive ""quick look"" review. "
675,8," The Maricopa Court noted in a footnote that HN9[
] price fixing is ""among the practices which the courts have heretofore 
deemed to be unlawful in and of themselves."" Id. at 344 n.15 (quoting Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. 
Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958)) (parallel citation omitted). "
676,9," Also similar to the agreements forming Equilon and Motiva, the Citizen Publishing agreement imposed several anticompetitive 
controls: first, the joint venture consolidated pricing and set joint subscription and advertising rates; second, the venture pooled 
all profits and losses pursuant ""to an agreed ratio""; and third, the two parent corporations agreed not to compete against each 
other or the joint venture in the relevant market areas. Id. "
677,10," See also NCAA, 468 U.S. at 109-10 (""As a matter of law, the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked 
restraint on price or output. . . . This naked restraint on price and output requires some competitive justification even in the 
absence of a detailed market analysis."")."
677,11," Thus, contrary to our dissenting colleague's understanding, the pricing decision was not made by a single economic entity. 
See Post, at 6901, id. at 6902 (""Nothing more radical is afoot than the fact that an entity, which now owns all of the production, 
transportation, research, storage, sales and distribution facilities for engaging in the gasoline business, also prices its own 
products. It decided to price them the same, as any other entity could.""). At this stage of the litigation, we are required to draw all 
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. Viewing the evidence in that light, there is at least a triable issue of fact as to 
whether Texaco and Shell agreed in advance to charge the same price for their two distinct gasoline brands as an initial 
operating requirement of the alliance. The decision by Texaco and Shell to include in their joint ventures a unified pricing 
scheme was not a decision made by a single economic entity -- it was a decision made by competitors. Whether the agreement 
constituted ""a conspiracy [] in restraint of trade,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1, or whether such a conspiracy would exist regardless of when the 
decision to engage in unified pricing was made, is for the district court to determine on remand."
677,12," The district court asked whether ""Equilon and Motiva are either mere window-dressings for a price fixing conspiracy or . . . are 
otherwise patently anticompetitive."" "
678,13," We assume that normal market factors would include the cost of production and marketing, supply, demand, and the like."
678,14," As one commentator has explained, HN17[
] Once a court finds the joint venture proper, it can easily determine the appropriateness of any related competitive 
restraints among the parties to the venture. A court should simply consider whether such restraints are necessary to 
promote the venture's procompetitive purposes. If a joint venture itself is procompetitive, the courts should uphold any 
restrictions on competition necessary to achieve its legitimate purposes. . . . The defendant should have the burden of 
proving that a competitive restraint is required to further a venture's efficiency objectives. If a defendant fails to meet this 
burden, a court should preclude the restraint without any further inquiry. Thomas A. Piraino, Jr., A Proposed Antitrust Approach to Collaborations Among Competitors, 86 Iowa L. Rev. 1137, 1188-89 
(2001)."
678,15," As stated earlier, this single price was subject to variations depending upon geographic markets, such that the price of the 
Texaco and Shell brands might be higher in San Diego, California than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska. The two brands, however, 
were always priced together in each geographic market -- the price never varied as between the two. "
679,16," Indeed, the record is close to establishing that the price-fixing scheme was sufficiently unrelated to accomplishing the 
legitimate objectives of the joint venture as to justify granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. However, given the 
complexity of the economic arrangements at issue, the sparseness of the record, the district court's failure to apply the 
appropriate test, and our general presumption against granting summary judgment in such cases, we conclude that the denial of 
both sides' motion for summary judgment is appropriate here."
679,17," The Act provides that HN19[
] ""it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality[.]"" 15 
U.S.C. § 13(a)."
679,18," The Act explicitly excludes price differentials ""which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, 
or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or 
delivered[.]"" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). "
680,19," Congress's response to Citizen Publishing further convinces us that we should not carve out an exception to the Sherman Act 
simply because the type of venture at issue here may be economically efficient. Shortly after the decision, Congress passed the 
Newspaper Preservation Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1804, which specifically exempted from the Sherman Act newspaper operating "
681,," arrangements like the one in Citizen Publishing. See Hawaii Newspaper Agency v. Bronster, 103 F.3d 742, 744-45 (9th. Cir. 
1996). After surveying the relevant ""economic conditions,"" Congress determined that the specific type of joint venture at issue 
was beneficial and even necessary in a ""large majority of American communities."" H.R. Rep. No. 91-1193, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 
(1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3547, 3548. Those economic conditions, in Congress's view, justified more lenient 
antitrust review of newspaper industry joint ventures than the Court had applied in Citizen Publishing. Congress has made no 
such findings, nor has it passed any similar law, relevant to the oil and gasoline industry, which certainly is not without its 
supporters in the Legislative and Executive Branch. If Congress wishes to exempt oil and gasoline enterprises from the Sherman 
Act's per se prohibition of price fixing, it may certainly do so, but it is beyond our authority to read new exceptions into the Act."
681,1," Henceforth, I shall only refer to Equilon because it is the entity that directly affects plaintiffs in this case -- Independent 
Operators."
681,2," We have previously had occasion to describe the nature of Equilon. See Abrahim & Sons Enters. v. Equilon Enters., LLC, 292 
F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir. 2002). As we stated, an LLC is an entity truly distinct from its members and its acts ""are deemed 
independent of the acts of its members."" Id. at 962. It is a separate juridical person. Id. LLCs are much like corporations, and, 
though controlled by their members, ""LLCs remain separate and distinct from their members."" Id. "
683,3," Shell, by the way, is a mere member of Equilon and is shielded from liability for the debts or obligations of Equilon, just as 
corporate share-holders are shielded. See Cal. Corp. Code § 17101."
683,4," Similarly, no ""quick look"" violation is shown. See Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 1612, 143 L. 
Ed. 2d 935 (1999); Bogan v. Hodgkins, 166 F.3d 509, 514 n.6 (2d Cir. 1999). "
688,1," Under the Supreme Court decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, indirect purchasers have no recourse under federal law. 431 
U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Lorix's counsel stated at oral argument that the 18 other jurisdictions in which 
actions similar to this have been brought are states that permit indirect purchasers to recover for injuries as a result of violations 
of state antitrust law. "
690,2," Lorix states that this estimated figure was arrived at ""by comparing the value of the proportionate share of tire shipments in 
Minnesota with [Flexsys's] total [market] share of rubber-processing chemicals in the United States."""
690,3," Minn. Stat. § 325D.57 provides that HN7[
] ""any person, any governmental body, or the state of Minnesota or any of its subdivisions or agencies, injured directly or indirectly by a violation of sections 325D.49 to 325D.66, shall recover three times the 
actual damages sustained, together with costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees."" "
691,4," Although the record includes no information regarding the Flexsys website, Lorix alleges that Flexsys's website promotes its 
products in Minnesota, asserting that the website states ""Flexsys is committed to developing web applications that benefit our 
customers and improve business efficiency. We offer our customers fast, secure, around-the-clock on-line ordering and access 
to the information you want - when you want it."" Flexsys asserts, however, that its website is ""aimed at no particular place in the 
world"" and does not actually sell products to Internet users but instead gives existing customers who have user-identification 
numbers and passwords the ability to order online. "
703,1," Masimo's lawsuit follows a six week jury trial, during which various patents issued by Masimo and Nellcor (a subsidiary of Tyco) 
were litigated. The trial was bifurcated into stages, beginning with infringement and validity and then damages. The Court also 
heard equitable issues outside the presence of the jury. The jury found for Masimo on all claims, finding that Nellcor infringed 
either literally or through the doctrine of equivalents all of Masimo's patents at issue. Consequently, the jury awarded $ 
134,528,960 in damages to Masimo in reasonable royalties and lost profits. Nellcor has since petitioned for judgment as a matter 
of law (JMOL) on several issues, and this Court is currently considering Nellcor's motions. "

722,2," Although the First Amended Complaint does not specifically allege where these meetings in the spring and early summer of 
1998 took place, they must have occurred in Europe. "
723,3, The First Amended Complaint does not indicate where Rousseaux was located when he received Gerber's call.
723,4," The First Amended Complaint does not specifically allege the location of Gerber's job with Amylum, but because Amylum is a 
Belgian company with offices in France, Gerber must have worked in Europe. "
724,5," Tate & Lyle, Amylum, Amylum France, Staley, Gerber, and Piwnica each submitted separate motion papers in support of the 
motion to dismiss. "
725,6," Notably, the Iowa court in Roquette II expressed its view that plaintiffs' allegations against Staley are baseless: ""Despite 
voluminous discovery from the March 1999 filing of [Roquette I] until the July 3, 2001 hearing [in Roquette II], the plaintiffs have 
found no clear evidence that any of their proprietary information has found its way directly or indirectly to Staley."" (D'Amore 
Decl., Ex. 3 at P 44). "
726,7," Plaintiffs allege that Amylum only withdrew from negotiations because of litigation commenced by RAI and Roquette. (Id. P 90). 
Even if true, the fact remains that Amylum is not alleged to have sold any sorbitol in the United States in competition with 
plaintiffs. "
727,8," Plaintiffs do argue that their allegations satisfy the Second Circuit's test for personal jurisdiction in a section of their opposition 
brief entitled ""Amended Complaint Satisfies The 'Conduct' Test."" (Plts.' Opp. Br. at 6-7). This test, however, differs from the 
conduct test used to determine RICO's extraterritorial application. Because plaintiffs' claims fail to adequately allege this Court's 
subject matter jurisdiction, I do not address the merits of their arguments for personal jurisdiction. "

763,1," Jefferson Parish is not mentioned in appellant Golka's briefs. There are two reasons we know the omission was deliberate: 
One, Golka's counsel is clearly extremely learned in antitrust law, and would naturally know of the case in any event; and, two, 
it was discussed at oral argument on the nonsuit motion which led to this appeal. We presume that he has not discussed the 
case on the assumption that it is inapplicable because it does not involve franchisors with valuable trade names, a point we 
discuss in a few more paragraphs. "
771,1," The remaining named defendants in this case, Sunrise Southwest, L.L.C., and Sunrise Transportation, Inc., filed a motion to 
dismiss the state law claims against them for failure to state a claim. However, since they were not named in plaintiffs' Sherman 
Act or RICO claims, they did not join the other defendants in moving to dismiss the claims for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, 
unless otherwise specified, all references to ""defendants"" in this case refer only to Southwest, Southwest Leasing, Bear Bones 
Leasing, Hackel, Wagner, and Meister. "
790,1," Defendants' expert uses the term ""upstream market"" to refer to sales between mills and service centers, and ""downstream 
market"" to refer to sales (by mills and service centers) to end users. The Court finds the nomenclature helpful and uses it 
accordingly. "
791,2," Steven N. Wiggins' full report and John R. Campbell's report are included in Volume II of Samuel's summary judgment 
appendix (Dkt. No. 171). Donald Murry's full deposition transcript is included in the appendix to Defendants' motion to preclude 
his testimony (Dkt. No. 230) as exhibit 3."
791,3," A key pricing component of aluminum is the spot price of aluminum ingot, which is set on international commodity markets. 
Wiggins Report P 46, at 15; Murry Report at 2. ""[A] conversion factor covering the cost of converting aluminum ingot into a 
product such as coiled sheet"" is added to the ingot price. Wiggins Report P 46, at 15. In addition, various ""contractual 
mechanisms"" including list prices, contract prices, special terms contracts, and annual contracts affect mill prices. Wiggins 
Report P 47, at 15. Volume discounts, incumbency policies, and rebates also affect the prices a mill will offer to a particular 
service center. See Pl.'s Ex. 97 (Wilsey Report) P 13, at 3; Pl.'s Resp. P 74, at 38-39. "
792,4," Plaintiff also claims to have purchased metal from its customers, but at a markup. See Pl.'s Resp. at 38 n.31 (referring to Merritt 
Equipment Company and Sundowner Trailers). "
793,5," Plaintiff offers no explanation of why it did not acquire the sworn affidavits of these witnesses and chose instead to rely solely 
on the hearsay testimony of Mike Champagne and Plaintiff's employees. Relayed in such a manner, the underlying statements 
are clearly hearsay. Notwithstanding this, Plaintiff argues that these statements should be considered as he can produce the 
declarants at trial. See Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 470 (3d Cir. 1998). To consider these statements would 
run contrary to Tenth Circuit precedent. See Thomas, 48 F.3d at 485 (stating that HN10[
] a third party may not simply 
describe another witness's supposed testimony and such descriptions are ""not suitable grist for the summary judgment mill.""). 
However, in more than one instance, other witnesses, who Plaintiff alleges made similar statements to those made by the mill 
representatives, deny during deposition having made those statements at all or clarify and explain the statements in a way that 
is directly opposite to the meaning assigned to the statement by Plaintiff. This, of course, just underscores the reliability 
concerns surrounding the admission of hearsay, the risk of inaccuracies in perception, memory, or narration, deliberate or 
otherwise. See 30 Charles Alan Wright & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 6324 (1997). "
795,6," Plaintiff also argues that Integris impliedly assumed VMG's and RASCO's liability by ""agreeing to a highly inclusive definition of 
liabilities."" Pl.'s Resp. at 119. However, the agreement is quite clear that only certain liabilities were assumed. See Integris' Ex. 
1A. The expansive definition of liabilities does not eviscerate those provisions. Therefore, the implied assumption exception 
would not apply. "
796,7," HN16[
] Statements by predecessors-in-interest are commonly admitted as statements against interest or under the residual 
clause. See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) & 807. However, both of these hearsay exceptions are only applicable under certain 
conditions, and Plaintiff has not attempted to argue that it will be able to satisfy those conditions. See Fed. R. Evid. 804 
(requiring that the declarant be unavailable before the statement is admitted); Fed. R. Evid. 807 (requiring that the Plaintiff make 
a showing as to the probative value of the statement and Plaintiff's efforts to obtain the evidence from other sources); see also 
Herrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184, 1192 (10th Cir. 2002) (discussing the burdens on a party when seeking to admit evidence 
under Fed. R. Evid. 807); United States v. Tome, 61 F.3d 1446, 1452 (10th Cir. 1995) (emphasizing that admitting evidence 
under the residual exception is reserved for ""extraordinary circumstances""). "
797,8," NAAD is the National Association of Aluminum Dealers. Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Champagne Aff.) P 10, at 2. It was an invitation-only 
organization that has since merged with the Metals Service Center Institute. Id."
797,9," Because Bill Thomas was unsure that Debbie Veale actually referred to a ""circling of the wagons"" during their conversation, the 
Court does not consider that as part of her statement. See Pl.'s Ex. 34 (Thomas Dep.) at 121. "
798,10," The following description of group boycott mechanics underscores the qualitative difference between Plaintiff's examples and 
direct evidence of a conspiracy: The boycotting group members, in effect, say to their suppliers . . ., ""If you don't stop dealing with non-group members, we will 
stop dealing with you."" If continued trade with group members is more important to a supplier . . . than is trading with non-group 
members, this threat will be effective. L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 83, at 230 (1977) (quoted in Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1984)). "
799,11," In its Response, Plaintiff cites authority for the proposition that when the alleged conduct is ""facially anticompetitive and 
exactly the harm the antitrust laws aim to prevent, no special care need be taken in assigning inferences to circumstantial 
evidence."" Pl.'s Resp. at 82-83. However, HN28[
] ambiguous evidence, that is, evidence that is equally consistent with 
independent as with concerted action, still cannot reasonably support an inference of a conspiracy. Thus, notwithstanding the 
plausibility issues identified below, the Court would be unwilling to characterize the Defendants' actions, on this record, as 
facially anticompetitive. See InterVest, 340 F.3d at 163. To do so, would risk allowing unsupported group boycott allegations to 
pass summary judgment without any evidentiary support. "
800,12," Plaintiff also contends that collective action was necessary because of the risk associated with moving business or threatening 
mills. Because that argument attempts to undercut the Defendants' contention that their complaints and threats were consistent 
with independent business judgments, it is addressed more fully below."
800,13," The Fifth Circuit explains: HN29[
] In passing on motion for summary judgment, even where the underlying facts are undisputed, it is hornbook law that 
the court must indulge every Reasonable inference from those facts in favor of the party opposing the motion. Insofar as any 
weighing of inferences from given facts is permissible, the task of the court is not to weigh these against each other but rather to 
cull the universe of possible inferences from the facts established by weighing each against the abstract standard of 
reasonableness, casting aside those which do not meet it and focusing solely on those which do. If a frog be found in the party 
punch bowl, the presence of a mischievous guest but not the occurrence of spontaneous generation may reasonably be inferred. A T & T v. Delta Communications Corp., 590 F.2d 100, 101-02 (5th Cir. 1979). "
801,14," The Court considers this evidence as Mr. Krausse's opinion based on his twenty-some year experience in the industry, rather 
than as repeating what unidentified mill representatives had actually told him in the past. "
802,15," Elsewhere, Plaintiff refers to John Guest's testimony about the ""rules of the game"" which require a service center to be a 
member of a ""club"" before it would be recognized by a mill. The Court has been unable to locate that testimony in the excerpted 
deposition transcript. Plaintiff cites to pages 9 and 10 in its motion in limine response, but those pages were not included as part 
of the summary judgment materials. See Pl.'s Resp. (Dkt. No. 260) at 16. The memo from Mr. Guest recommending that Alcoa 
not recognize Champagne Metals, which is attached as summary judgment evidence, may lend support to Plaintiff's theories 
about a club and rules, but it does not specifically employ such terms. See Pl.'s Ex. 57 (Guest Memo) (identifying Champagne 
Metals as a competitor of VMG, RASCO, and Ryerson ""with respect to market coverage"" and noting, ""Ideally, [Champagne 
Metals] would be a location to recognize, if one of our existing distributors acquired them.""). Regardless, such evidence is 
inconclusive as to the critical issue of whether a long- standing agreement or understanding existed among service centers and 
would not alter the conclusion reached above."
802,16," Because Plaintiff never directly asserts that the Defendants engaged in a tacit agreement, the Court is loathe to construct an 
argument on its behalf. Nevertheless, the Court is mindful that the Tenth Circuit has given tacit agreements at least a passing 
nod. In Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., 899 F.2d 951, 963 (10th Cir. 1990), the Court observed that a 
challenged Section 1 agreement ""need not be in writing or even be explicit."" However, except for that single sentence, which 
was unrelated to the issues on appeal, the Court is not aware of anything to suggest that the Circuit's views are contrary to those 
identified above. Thus, had Plaintiff intended to pursue a tacit agreement theory, it should have done so explicitly and provided 
argument and authority for that result in addition to the colorful references to history. "
803,17," Plaintiff's evidence regarding Ryerson's alleged complaints to Alcoa regarding EMJ 15 years ago is hearsay. See Pl.'s Ex. 31 
(Stevenson Dep.) at 20, 183-93 & 286-87. "
804,18," Statements by Bruce Colin and Ron McClure regarding Kaiser's concern that EMJ would retaliate if Kaiser sold to Champagne 
Metals are hearsay and inadmissible to show that EMJ actually threatened Kaiser. Similarly, Plaintiff has offered no hearsay 
analysis with respect to EMJ's alleged call to Commonwealth reporting that Samuel would not be selling its CTL line to 
Champagne Metals as described in Mike Champagne's affidavit. See Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Champagne Aff) P 5, at 1-2. Therefore, the 
Court will not consider that testimony."
804,19, The Court treats Ms. Veale's reference to her counterparts' unhappiness as non-hearsay for purposes of summary judgment. 
805,20," Auto Crane manufactures cranes, crane service bodies, hydraulic air compressors, and crane accessories. Pl.'s Ex. 2 
(Holloway Aff.) P 1, at 1."
805,21," Craig Colyer's statements to Mike Champagne are hearsay. Plaintiff has not provided an affidavit or indicated that Mr. Coyler 
would testify at trial about his experiences in the industry and how the ""game"" works. Moreover, Plaintiff's evidence that Ryerson 
threatened Alcoa in the past not to recognize EMJ is hearsay. Pl.'s Ex. 31 (Stevenson Dep.) at 20, 183-93 & 286-87. However, 
Defendants' effort to rely on that evidence to show that the Defendants were adversarial is contrary to their evidentiary objection. 
Nevertheless, even if stipulated to, its probative value on the conspiracy issue is minimal. Finally, Mr. Champagne's recounting 
of what Janet Kazinski of Acme Engineering told him is hearsay. Pl.'s Ex. 9 (Champagne Dep.) at 1127-29 (reporting that 
Ryerson told Acme that Champagne Metals ""would not be able to buy metal or compete in that business""). "
807,22," Apparently, Ormet had previously considered and rejected Champagne Metals as a distributor in 1998. See Pl.'s Ex. 9 
(Champagne Dep.) at 406. "
808,23," The Court does not consider Clark Borgelt's ""belief' that Metalwest probably exerted pressure on Ormet. It is either hearsay or 
pure speculation. "
811,24," The Court considers only statements made before November 2001 that could be characterized as threats in conformity with 
the hearsay ruling above. Plaintiff explains that Pierce's conversations with Henry Spies and Dave Nuccetelli occurred in mid-
2001. Pl.'s Resp. P 59, at 31."
811,25," Because Mr. Stoker's alleged statements were not threats, they are not considered under the verbal act exception."
811,26," The Court does not consider Alcan documents referring to Rasco and VMG's ""displeasure"" at Commonwealth's recognition of 
Champagne Metals for the truth of those references. Pl.'s Exs. 68 & 69. Plaintiff fails to lay a proper foundation for their 
admission. "
812,27," The Court notes that the conclusion that the Oklahoma Antitrust Act reaches unilateral acts has not actually been decided by 
an Oklahoma appellate court. However, it has been so interpreted by the Tenth Circuit and that interpretation is binding on this 
Court. "
813,28," These and additional problems with Dr. Murry's opinions, including those related to his definition of the relevant market, are 
detailed in the Court's separate Daubert Order."
813,29," Blue Cross engaged in a horizontal conspiracy by conspiring with certain hospitals to harm their competitor, another hospital. 
899 F.2d at 965. "
814,30," Although Plaintiff has presented evidence that in July 2000 Alcoa considered designating Plaintiff as a distributor but decided 
against it, at least in part, because Alcoa stood to lose business from Ryerson and Integris, it did not present any evidence of 
communication, much less interference by the Defendants."
814,31," However, Plaintiff goes onto cite cases that were analyzing claims of tortious interference with prospective business 
advantage for support that it can state a claim for relief for interference in business relationships that have not been reduced to a 
contract. From this analysis, Plaintiff does not appear to appreciate the distinction between these two claims. Nonetheless, 
Plaintiff is unable to state a claim for these Defendants' interference with its relationship with Ormet under either theory. "
816,32," Although there are additional statements made by Integris' predecessors-in-interest which are relevant to this claim, these 
statements are hearsay and, as discussed above, not subject to the statutory exclusion provided by Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). 
Therefore, they are not admissible and are not considered. "
826,1," Relying on North Central F.S., Inc. v. Brown, 951 F. Supp. 1383, 1412 n.22 (N.D. Iowa 1996), and EEOC v. Mike Fink Corp., 
1998 WL 34078445, at *6 (M.D. Term. July 17, 1998), Princeton Review argues that because its counterclaims seek a 
declaration of rights that are the ""mirror image"" of the relief AAMC seeks, there is no basis for dismissal of its counterclaims on 
the face of the pleading. Def.'s Opp'n at 11. Princeton Review's argument is without merit and its reliance on North Central, 951 
F. Supp. at 1412 n.22, and Mike Fink Corp., 1998 WL 34078445, at *6, is misplaced. "
827,2," HN5[
] The unclean hands defense closes the doors of a court of equity to a party tainted with inequitableness or bad faith 
relative to the matter in which she seeks relief and derives from the equitable maxim that one '""who comes into equity must 
come with clean hands.'"" United States v. Philip Morris Inc., 300 F. Supp. 2d 61, 74 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting Precision Instrument 
Mfg. Co. v. Auto. Maint. Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814, 89 L. Ed. 1381, 65 S. Ct. 993, 1945 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 582 (1945))."
827,3," In this landmark patent infringement action, the Supreme Court held that a patent operates to create and grant to the patentee 
an exclusive right to make, use and vend the particular device described in and claimed in the patent, but does not grant 
immunity for a monopoly not within the grant. Morton Salt, 314 U.S. at 491. Thus, the court stated that use of a patent to 
suppress the sale of an unpatented article may preclude the patentee from prevailing on an infringement claim because equity 
requires that a party have ""clean hands."" Id. at 491-92. "
828,4," The court acknowledges that Princeton Review asserts in its opposition that ""AAMC seeks to leverage its membership 
monopoly as well as its monopoly over the [MCAT] to extend its rights beyond those granted to it pursuant to Section 106 of the 
Copyright Act"" and ""abuses the monopoly power granted by the copyrights."" Def.'s Opp'n at 13, 16. However, neither of 
Princeton Review's counterclaims asserts a violation of antitrust law. HN6[
] ""Ordinarily, absent a formal motion to . . . amend 
the complaint, a court does not treat the contents of an opposition to a motion to dismiss as an amendment to a complaint.""

U.S. App. D.C. 327, 278 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2002))."
828,5," Princeton Review refers the court to Assessment Technologies of WI, LLC, v. WIREdata, Inc., 350 F.3d 640 (7th Cir. 2003), in 
arguing that a copyright misuse counterclaim is not limited to antitrust violations. Id. at 647 (stating that the argument for 
applying misuse of copyright beyond the bounds of antitrust is that an ""abuse of process"" has occurred). Assessment 
Technologies, however, is not analogous to the present case. First, Assessment Technologies is a case ""about the attempt of a 
copyright owner to use copyright law to block access to data that not only are neither copyrightable nor copyrighted, but were not 
created or obtained by the copyright owner."" Id. at 641. The instant lawsuit involves AAMC's MCAT test forms and questions, 
which are copyrighted materials. Second, Assessment Technologies addresses copyright misuse as a defense to infringement 
and does not discuss whether the doctrine could be recognized as an independent claim or counterclaim. See id. at 647. "
830,6," Moreover, under federal regulations, the very definition of a secure a secure test, such as the MCAT, requires restricted access 
to the test. 37 C.F.R. § 202.20(b)(4) provides: HN12[
] A secure test is a nonmarketed test administered under supervision at specified centers on specific dates, all 
copies of which are accounted for and either destroyed or returned to restricted locked storage following each 
administration. For these purposes a test is not marketed if copies are not sold but it is distributed and used in such a 
manner that ownership and control of copies remain with the test sponsor or publisher. Id. The Library of Congress does not retain a copy of secure tests. 37 C.F.R. § 202.20(c)(2)(vi)."
830,7," Among the specific state statutes Princeton Review cites, California's truth in testing laws expressly state that HN13[
] 
""nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or authorize the infringement of any rights protected by law relating to 
copyright."" CAL. EDUC. CODE § 99162. HN14[
] Arizona's truth in testing law exempts from its scope any nationally 
standardized test that is copyrighted and would be deprived of value if the questions or answers become known to pupils before 
the test. ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 15-747(A). Arizona law also prohibits ""any other activities that would violate the copyright 
protection afforded by federal law to the copyright holders of the tests."" ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 15-747(B). "

RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 39 (1995) (""A trade secret is any information that can be used in the 
operation of a business or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential economic 
advantage over others.""). "
833,10," Princeton Review also raises its argument regarding truth in testing laws in connection with this affirmative defense. Because 
the court found this argument to be without merit in Section II.B.S.b, the court will not consider the argument here. "
834,11," D.C. Code § 28-3502 provides, in relevant part: HN21[
] An action may not be brought . . . upon an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making

not state the consideration and signed by the party to be charged therewith or a person authorized by him. Id. "

customer of an entity controlling an essential facility access to it upon reasonable terms if the effect of such denial is to 
injure competition. An injured competitor or customer may bring an action under Section 5 of this act to enforce the 
provisions of this section only when such injured competitor or customer does not have a remedy before the Corporation 
Commission. Okla. Stat. tit. 79, § 203(A)-(C). HN9[

847,4," Plaintiffs did offer evidence of the market share of the individual products distributed by Bottling Group; however, evidence of 
the market share of the products as a product cluster is not provided. "
848,5," Plaintiffs may have argued below that Bottling Group had monopoly power in a product market more broadly defined as the 
market for all soft drink and other beverage products distributed to retail grocers. By failing to re-assert this argument on appeal, 
however, Plaintiffs have waived it, and, in any event, the record does not support such a theory. "
863,1," Plaintiff's original pleadings also named Richard N. Dixon, former Maryland State Treasurer, and William Donald Schaefer, 
Comptroller of the Treasury as Defendants. This court, held an initial motions hearing on August 28, 2002, at which time 
defendants were reduced to the State of Maryland, Office of the State Treasurer, Office of the Comptroller of the Treasury and 
the State Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Herein, ""State"" and/or ""Maryland"" will refer to some and/or all 
Defendants."

Covad alleges, BellSouth may well have violated the § 252(d)(1) requirement of ""nondiscriminatory"" pricing for unbundled 
network elements. But such a claim - which Covad has not made in this case - would involve a dispute over the terms of the

The middleware at issue in Microsoft III was primarily web-browsing software. The district court's remedy in this case, however, 
covers a far broader array of middleware. Accordingly, the district court was at pains to define Microsoft's middleware and that of 
its rivals. See States' Remedy §§ VI.J, VI.K, VI.M, VI.N, at 275-76. We need not here recount the district court's extensive 
treatment of those definitions, see States' Remedy, at 112-21, but the definitions are discussed as needed below. "
990,4," Massachusetts also argues the district court erred insofar as it rejected the States' proposal because the proposal did not 
provide adequate guidance for determining which code constitutes Microsoft middleware and was otherwise too difficult 
technically. The district court's findings, however, discussed in part at the outset of this section, fully support its reasons for 
rejecting the States' unbinding remedy. See States' Remedy, 245-52; see also id. at 255."

991,," greatest benefits of Windows -- a platform for applications that supports new functionality while providing backward compatibility 
for most existing applications""). "

a particular functionality was present in any given configuration of the new unbound Windows [which,] at least in the short term 
… would likely cause existing applications to fail. [In the longer run there is the risk that] software code distributed with one ISV's

email client (such as Outlook Express) or instant messaging software (such as Windows Messenger) will become a platform 
threat""). "
996,9," Massachusetts also argues the district court abused its discretion by refusing to define Microsoft's Common Language Runtime 
(CLR) as a Microsoft Middleware Product and hence subject to the API-disclosure requirement of § III.D. The district court 
described the CLR as middleware similar to Java but a part of Microsoft's new "".NET framework,"" a Web-services initiative 
comprising ""server-based applications that can be accessed directly by other software programs, as well as by the consumer 
through a variety of devices, including the PC, cellular phone, and handheld device."" States' Remedy, at 126; see also Borduin 
P 80, 2 J.A. (II) at 1333 (explaining importance of CLR in .NET initiative). As discussed in Part II.A.4 below, the district court 
refused to address Web services in the remedial decree, stating that ""this case cannot be used as a vehicle by which to fight 
every potential future violation of the antitrust laws by Microsoft envisioned by Microsoft's competitors."" States' Remedy, at 133. 
Just so, and the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by refusing to list the CLR along with the other functionalities 
specified in the definition of Microsoft Middleware Product. See id. at 275. Because Microsoft's Web-services initiative and 
Microsoft Middleware are not mutually exclusive categories, however, the CLR may yet become subject to the disclosure 
requirement of § III.D if it satisfies the definition of Microsoft Middleware in the decree, see States' Remedy § VI.J, at 275. That 
definition requires, among other things, the middleware to be ""distributed separately"" from Windows; according to Microsoft's 
counsel at oral argument, there is record evidence that has already occurred. "
997,10," See, e.g., States' Remedy, at 227 (citing 5/10/02 pm Tr. at 7111-12 (Bennett trial testimony), 6 J.A. (II) at 3596 (""Well, if you 
read [the definition of Interoperate], it says: Effectively, access, utilize and/or support the full features and functionality of one 
another. That, to me, taken in its entirety … means the ability to clone.""))."

blueprints for Windows, competitors … would have little trouble writing their own implementation of everything valuable that 
Windows provides today, including the capabilities it provides to developers via APIs""))."
997,12," In a footnote to its argument concerning the disclosure of communications protocols, Massachusetts asserts the district court 
clearly erred in suggesting the States' proposed definition could lead to cloning, for which assertion it cites the opinion of Dr. 
Appel that ""the States' Remedy does not allow such copying,"" P 99, 2 J.A. (II) at 1284; see also PP 100-07, id. at 1284-88. This 
testimony, although contrary to the district court's finding that the States' broad definition of interoperation could lead to cloning, 
is hardly sufficient for us to conclude the district court's finding is clearly erroneous. See Microsoft III, at 66 (""In view of the 
contradictory testimony in the record, some of which supports the District Court's finding …, we cannot conclude that the finding 
was clearly erroneous""). "

of the antitrust laws, however, it was reasonable for the district court to focus upon the restoration of competitive conditions 
facing makers of rival middleware rather than lending a hand to makers of rival operating systems; it was middleware with the 
potential to create a platform threat, not rival operating systems, against which Microsoft acted unlawfully. Findings of Fact, at

Government nor Microsoft explains what type of pleading the would-be intervenors could have filed in a case such as this, where 
a judgment had already been rendered. In any event, HN18[

hypertechnical, actually, in making sure that … potential intervenors do file a pleading."" The Government and Microsoft make no 
claim they had inadequate notice of the intervenors' appeal, and we find no reason to bar intervention based solely upon this 
technical defect, if defect it be. "

1032,1," Still other conduct may fall into a hybrid category known as a ""quick look"" § 1 case. Other than Monsanto's no replant policy 
already addressed supra, defendants do not contend that any of Monsanto's conduct fails the ""quick look"" test. "
1033,2," Defendants also alleged that Monsanto's no replant policy creates a de facto tie between traits and germ plasm; however, the 
Federal Circuit considered precisely the same argument in McFarling and found it insufficient as a matter of law: We need not plumb the complexities of tying …, however, to determine that the district court correctly granted summary 
judgment for Monsanio. McFarling does not raise a typical tying allegation, and the mere recitation of the word ""tying"" is not 
sufficient…. McFarling's ""tying"" argument instead centers on his desire to replant the entire seed, including the genetic modifications, 
and on Monsanto's refusal to grant him permission to do so. … At its simplest, McFarling effectively argues . . . that he 
should be granted a compulsory license to use the patent rights in conjunction with the second-generation ROUNDUP 
READY(R) soybeans in his possession after harvest. We decline to hold that Mosquito's raw exercise of its' right to exclude 
from the patented invention by itself is a ""tying arrangement""….. McFarling, 363 F.3d at 1342. The defendants also claimed that Monsanto tied the use of its traits to the purchase of seed in 
subsequent years. This, too, is an attack on Monsanto's no replant policy. It likewise fails. "
1034,3," The same is true with regard to the defendants' challenge to Monsanto's grower license agreements since 1999. The Court 
categorically rejects the assertion that Monsanto's failure to list all approved non-Roundup glyphosate herbicides in the 
technology agreement causes consumer confusion and unduly bolsters Monsanto's branded products. The agreement provides: 
""Grower agrees … to use on Roundup Ready crops only a Roundup(R) agricultural herbicide or other authorized non-selective 
herbicide which could not be used in the absence of the Roundup Ready gene (see TUG [Technology Use Guide] for details on 
authorized non-selective products)."" The language used communicates that glyphosate-based herbicides other than Roundup 
may be used with Roundup Ready crops and that additional information about alternative glyphosate-based herbicides may be 
obtained from the TUG. The 2003 TUG provides: ""You may use another glyphosate herbicide, but only if it has been approved 
for use over Roundup Ready crops, and it has been labeled for this use by all required governmental agencies."" The farmer 
need only consult the label of any competing glyphosate product to determine whether the product is suitable for use over-the-
top of Roundup Ready crops."
1034,4," The Court doubts defendants' standing to challenge this aspect of Monsanto's seed partner agreements. A party who seeks 
injunctive relief under the antitrust laws must demonstrate some threatened loss or damage to his own interests. Cargill, Inc. v. 
Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). Defendants have made no showing that "
1035,," they are in a position to market competing glyphosate-based herbicides to any of Monsanto's seed partners, and the Court 
cannot conceive of any other harm which might inure to defendants from the complained of provisions. "
1036,5," Deaton's affidavit also declares: This provision does not mean that 75% of all new varieties of cottonseed sold by DPL must contain the stacked trait gene 
by 2003. For example, DPL is Tree to offer the same new line of cottonseed in several versions, each of which is called a 
separate variety -- conventional, Roundup Ready(R) only, Roundup Randy(R)/Bollgard(R) stacked trait, or Bollgard(R) only-
and still be in compliance with this agreement. Moreover, this provision contains no limitation on the quantity of seed 
without the stacked trait that DPL may sell. Exhibit K at p. 2."
1036,6," The Court concludes that defendants' evidence of the ""tying"" practices fails manifestly to demonstrate an unreasonable 
restraint on trade. Furthermore, to the extent that, the ""tying"" practices might, under a tortured interpretation, be considered 
undue restraints, the pro-competitive justifications offered by Monsanto offset any adverse effects on competition-real or 
potential. "
1037,7," Defendants also raise a § I conspiracy claim in their Counterclaim, It suffers from the same evidentiary deficiencies as the 
Scruggses' other § 1 claims. There being no genuine issues of material fact, Monsanto is entitled to summary judgment on the 
conspiracy claim as well. "
1038,8," Defendants alleged a fourth relevant market: the United Staves market and/or the relevant regional submarket for glyphosate 
herbicide. Monsanto does not find fault with this proposed market definition. The Scruggses1 claims that Monsanto monopolized 
and/or attempted to monopolize the glyphosate market are addressed infra. "
1039,9, Nor could one reasonably conclude that Monsanto had a dangerous probability of acquiring monopoly power.
1039,10," Defendants aver in their brief to Monsanto's control over the glyphosate molecule market; however, the Scruggses' counsel 
conceded at oral argument that the defendants had not pursued those issues in discovery. "
1047,1," For the reasons explained below in the text, the motion can be decided solely on the basis of Rule 12(b)(6), and the Court need 
not reach the arguments that NYMEX makes under Rule 12(b)(1). NYMEX's motion does not address ICE's fourth cause of 
action relating to NYMEX's copyright claim to its settlement prices, and therefore that cause of action cannot be dismissed. "
1055,2," Because ICE's second counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment that NYMEX's settlement prices are an essential facility, 
which, for the reasons explained in the text, they are not, that counterclaim is dismissed. However, NYMEX has not made any 
arguments in this motion that would support dismissing ICE's fourth counterclaim, which seeks a declaratory judgment that 
NYMEX does not have a copyright in its settlement prices, or, alternatively, that NYMEX cannot enforce such a copyright against 
ICE, or that ICE has not infringed any such copyright. Therefore, ICE's fourth counterclaim is not dismissed. "
1056,3," Because ICE's antitrust counterclaims are either voluntarily withdrawn or dismissed for failure to state a claim, there is no need 
to reach NYMEX's alternative arguments concerning implied repeal, antitrust standing, failure to allege harm to competition, and 
insufficiency of the alleged relevant markets. "
1063,*," Honorable Frank J. Magill, United States Senior Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1064,1," Unless otherwise noted, ""complaint"" in this opinion refers to the First Amended Complaint. SBS filed the First Amended 
Complaint before the defendants filed a response in order to cure technical difficulties with its original pleadings. The district 
court also treated allegations made at the oral hearing as part of this complaint. The court ""allowed SBS to rectify orally the facial 
deficiencies in its Amended Complaint because at this procedural stage, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in the 
Plaintiff's favor and consider, in the interests of justice and efficiency, the Plaintiff's best arguments."" Order of Jan. 31, 2003 at 1 
n.1. We have previously allowed district courts to consider allegations made in oral argument on the motion to dismiss. See, 
e.g., Oxford Asset Mgmt. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1194-95 (11th Cir. 2002). As discussed below, SBS also attempted to file a 
Second Amended Complaint with its motion for reconsideration. "
1065,2," SBS asserted that it considered the relevant market to be advertising purchased in the top ten Spanish-language markets and 
that HBC earned 51 of the advertising revenue in that market. For the purposes of the 12(b)(6) motion, the district court 
assumed that a relevant market had been shown for the Section One claims. We make the same assumption here. "
1066,3," We also note that the market for Spanish-language radio advertising is not limited to two competitors, as the argument by SBS 
implies. According to the numbers provided by SBS to the district court, some 26 of the market is not controlled by either HBC or 
SBS. That 26 includes the 10 market share belonging to Entravision, which is one-third owned by Univision, HBC's new merger 
partner. SBS made these factual allegations at the hearing on the motion to dismiss before the district court. Tr. at 20-23. See 
also supra note 1 (explaining the district court's consideration of allegations made at the hearing on the motion to dismiss). "
1067,4," See Amended Complaint P 12; Tr. at 20-23, 34-38."
1067,5," Many antitrust cases turn on the precise definition of this market, as defendants contest whether they possess market power or 
whether the restraint at issue affected the market as a whole. "
1068,6," The complaint notes that the Department of Justice considered the two companies ""sufficiently related"" so as to block the 
transfer of radio stations. This does not imply control over day-to-day operations. Similarly, the allegation that CC executives 
acted ""on behalf of HBC"" may imply an agreement or conspiracy but not control such that CC should be considered a participant 
in the market."
1068,7," Moreover, even if SBS had alleged sufficient control over HBC by CC to state a claim for attempted monopolization by CC, this 
would not have cured the complaint's failure to allege harm to competition rather than harm to SBS alone. "
1069,8," We need not decide whether any of these alleged practices would give rise to state law claims. We merely note that they do not 
automatically give rise to an antitrust claim."
1069,9," As with the Section One claims, SBS also argues that, as the principal competitor of HBC in the market, harm to it inherently 
constitutes harm to competition. For the reasons stated in the previous section, we reject this argument. "
1070,10," In its original order, the district court denied a previous request by SBS to amend the complaint and add a conspiracy 
allegation after finding that a non-participant in the market could not conspire with a participant. The court relied upon our 
statement in Aquatherm that ""equally fatal to Aquatherm's conspiracy allegation is the fact that no authority exists holding a 
defendant can conspire to monopolize a market in which it does not compete."" 145 F.3d at 1262 n.4. However, in Aquatherm the 
plaintiffs did not name (or even identify) the alleged co-conspirators who participated in the relevant market. In this case, SBS 
alleges a conspiracy between HBC, a clear market participant, and CC. Nothing in our case law suggests that a conspiracy must 
be limited solely to market participants so long as the conspiracy also involves a market participant and the non-participant has 
an incentive to join the conspiracy. Cf. Spectators' Communication Network, Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, 253 F.3d 215, 222 
(5th Cir. 2001) (""We conclude that there can be sufficient evidence of a combination or conspiracy when one conspirator lacks a 
direct interest in precluding competition, but is enticed or coerced into knowingly curtailing competition by another conspirator 
who has an anticompetitive motive.""). In its brief, CC correctly points out that Spectators involved a group boycott with multiple 
conspirators, thereby giving the non-participant defendant the power to injure the plaintiff. Appellee CC Br. at 18-19. However, 
the case turned upon the ability and motive of the defendant to injure the plaintiff (and competition in general), not whether that 
power came from more than one co-conspirator."
1070,11," The proposed complaint adds significant detail to the allegations of unsavory behavior by CC and HBC described in the First 
Amended Complaint as well as additional detail on the market for Spanish-language radio advertising. Largely because of this 
detail, the proposed complaint remains under seal. We therefore do not describe these additional factual allegations with 
specificity. "
1091,1," HN1[
] ""A person shall be entitled to a patent unless . . . the invention was . . . in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States. . . . "" 35 USCS § 102(b). "
1092,2," HN2[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act defines the substantive violation of attempted monopolization. It states, in pertinent part: HN3[
] ""Every person who shall . . . attempt to monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. HN4[
] Private antitrust suits, including this one, technically proceed under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which states, again in pertinent part: HN5[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in . . . district court of the United 
States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 
15 U.S.C. § 15(a). "
1101,3," The Supreme Court has ruled that HN29[
] the regional circuits retain appellate jurisdiction over cases in which the complaint 
does not allege a claim arising under federal patent law, but the answer does contain a patent-law counterclaim. Holmes Group 
v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., 535 U.S. 826, 827, 153 L. Ed. 2d 13, 122 S. Ct. 1889 (2002). As a result, antitrust claims met 
with counterclaims of infringement may not come before this court. If the resolution of the dispute rests, in part, upon a 
determination of whether or not a patentee's behavior stripped it of its antitrust exemption, the appellate court hearing the matter 
will have to decide whether to apply Federal Circuit law or risk disturbing ""Congress's goal of ensuring patent-law uniformity,"" id., 
by applying its own law The choice of law rule that we announced in Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1067-68, is a sensible approach 
to preserving the uniformity of the patent law without regard to the appellate forum: Federal Circuit law determines whether or 
not the patentee enjoys antitrust immunity under the patent laws, while regional circuit law determines the other elements of the 
antitrust claim. "
1102,4," HN36[
] The patent law's pro tanto modification of the antitrust law, Simpson, 377 U.S. at 24, extends to behavior, not to either patents or patentees. It is entirely possible for a patentee to retain its antitrust exemption with respect to some behavior 
while being stripped of the exemption with respect to other behavior. ""Beyond the limited monopoly which is granted, the 
arrangements by which the patent is utilized are subject to the general law. . . . The possession of a valid patent or patents does 
not give the patentee any exemption from the provisions of the Sherman Act beyond the limits of the patent monopoly."" United 
States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 196-197, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct. 1773, 1963 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 547 (1963). The 
Sherman Act ""imposes strict limitations on the concerted activities in which patent owners may lawfully engage."" Id. "
1103,5," We decided Cygnus Therapeutic Sys. v. ALZA Corp., 92 F.3d 1153, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 1996) as a matter of Ninth Circuit law."
1103,6," Under normal circumstances, we would expect the prosecution history to play a critical role in proving that a patentee 
defrauded the PTO. The prosecution history is, after all, the record of all correspondence between the patentee and the PTO, 
and therefore provides the best direct evidence of every representation that the patentee made. In the present matter, neither 
party placed the prosecution history in the record. Because of this omission, the plaintiffs must build an entirely circumstantial 
case using inferences and presumptions. HN42[
] The presumption of validity implies that the Examiner believed the patent to 
be valid when it issued. American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F.2d 1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Regulations 
required the named inventor, Singh, to sign an oath attesting to his inventorship. 37 C.F.R. § 1.63. We may therefore presume 
that Singh represented to the PTO that he was the process' original inventor. "
1108,7," ConAgra failed to renew its motion for judgment as a matter of law (""JMOL"") after the verdict pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure 50(b). Unitherm contends that ConAgra therefore waived its right to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence supporting 
the jury's antitrust verdict. We have ruled HN55[
] as a matter of Federal Circuit law that, for issues unique to our jurisdiction, a 
50(b) motion is necessary to preserve a sufficiency of the evidence argument for appeal. Biodex Corp. v. Loredan Biomedical, 
Inc., 946 F.2d 850, 859-62 (Fed. Cir. 1991). On most issues related to Rule 50 motions, however, we generally apply regional 
circuit law unless the precise issue being appealed pertains uniquely to patent law. Duro-Last, Inc. v. Custom Seal, Inc., 321 
F.3d 1098, 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Because we decide antitrust issues that do not implicate patent law, including market "
1109,," definition, under the law of the regional circuits, Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1067 n.5, we similarly apply Tenth Circuit law to 
determine whether or not ConAgra has preserved its right to appeal. HN56[
] In the Tenth Circuit, the failure of a party to move 
for a JMOL post-verdict does not bar the party from appealing the sufficiency of the evidence, provided, as is the case here, that 
the party made the appropriate motion prior to the submission of the case to the jury. See Cummings v. Gen. Motors Corp., 365 
F.3d 944, 950-51 (10th Cir. 2004). The absence of a Rule 50(b) post-verdict motion for JMOL, however, precludes our entering 
judgment in favor of ConAgra. ""The only remedy available is a new trial."" Id. at 951. Thus, we may only vacate the jury's verdict 
in favor of Unitherm."
1109,8," HN59[
] ""Bad faith is a prerequisite to [a] state-law tortious interference claim; without it, the claim is preempted by patent 
law."" Zenith, 182 F.3d at 1355."
1109,9," Under Tenth Circuit law, ConAgra preserved its right to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence by moving for a directed verdict 
at the close of Unitherm's evidence and again at the close of its defense, despite failing to move for a post-verdict JMOL. See 
Cummings, 365 F.3d at 950-51. "

973 P.2d 527, 543 - 44 (Cal 1999), announced that HN6[
] in an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices, the 
alleged misconduct must be ""conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of 
one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens 
or harms competition."" The Cel-Tech court explicitly limited its discussion to actions by competitors alleging only anticompetitive 
practices. ""Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair 
competition law such as 'fraudulent' or 'unlawful' business practices or 'unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.'"" Id. at 
544 n.12. "
1117,2," The parties did not address whether Minnesota or California law applies to this dispute. Instead, the parties agree that the laws 
are similar. For the purposes of this motion, the Court need not address choice of law issues, because under either State's law, 
Ghirardelli has adequately pled a fraud cause of action. "
1130,1," This order does not address whether the artful pleading doctrine applies under the first two circumstances where it has been 
applied. Neither parties have argued that federal antitrust laws completely preempt state equivalents nor have defendants 
argued that plaintiff's Section 17200 claim is necessarily federal in character. "
1132,2," Also at the hearing, plaintiff raised for the first time that it would have no standing to assert a federal claim under the Sherman 
Act. This order does not address the standing issue since plaintiff did not brief the issue in its motion. Moreover, the issue is 
moot since defendants expressly conceded that plaintiff does have standing. "
1146,1," This matter was referred to the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to the Court' s Order Designating United States 
Magistrate Judge [Doc. 2]. Within ten (10) days after a party is served with a copy of this analysis and recommended disposition, that party may, pursuant

process requirement. "
1149,4," The related doctrine of collateral estoppel has a similar preclusive effect. That doctrine provides that, ""once a court has decided

(1999–2000 Reg. Sess.) (June 27, 2000), pp. 29 & 31 [responses to questions by Sen. Chesbro].)"
1165,5," Bronco contests the Legislature's findings, asserting that labels such as those set out in the record are not in law or in fact 
deceptive because they display a correct appellation of origin. The Legislature's findings to the contrary, however, are supported 
both by testimony and survey results presented at the hearings disclosing consumer confusion relating to such labels. Moreover, 
as observed at the hearings, an uninformed consumer may not know that an unelaborated term (for example, Lodi) appearing on 
a label refers to a geographic location outside Napa County or even that the named location (in contrast to the brand name of 
the wine) signifies the place where the grapes used to make the wine actually were grown. Similarly, consumers in restaurants 
who order wine by the bottle or the glass from menus may be aware only of the brand name of the wine and generally will not 
have an opportunity to read the label of the bottle before placing an order. "
1166,6," Section 25241 sets out in subdivision (a) the findings quoted above, and then HN1[
] provides: “(b) No wine produced, bottled, labeled, offered for sale or sold in California shall use, in a brand name or otherwise, on any 
label, packaging material, or advertising, any of the names of viticultural significance listed in subdivision (c), unless that wine 
qualifies under Section 4.25a [now section 4.25—see 68 Federal Register 39454, 39455 (July 2, 2003)] of Title 27 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations for the appellation of origin Napa County and includes on the label, packaging material, and advertising that 
appellation or a viticultural area appellation of origin that is located entirely within Napa County, subject to compliance with 
Section 25240. “Notwithstanding the above, this subdivision shall not grant any labeling, packaging, or advertising rights that are prohibited 
under federal law or regulations. “(c) The following are names of viticultural significance for purposes of this section: “(1) Napa. “(2) Any viticultural area appellation of origin established pursuant to Part 9 (commencing with Section 9.1) of Title 27 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations that is located entirely within Napa County. “(3) Any similar name to those in paragraph (1) or (2) that is likely to cause confusion as to the origin of the wine. “(d) The appellation of origin required by this section shall meet the legibility and size-of-type requirements set forth in either 
Section 4.38 or Section 4.63 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, whichever is applicable. “(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), any name of viticultural significance may appear either as part of the address required by 
Sections 4.35 and 4.62 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, if it is also the post office address of the bottling or 
producing winery or of the permittee responsible for the advertising, or as part of any factual, nonmisleading statement as to the 
history or location of the winery. “(f) The department may suspend or revoke the license of any person who produces or bottles wine who violates this section. 
Following notice of violation to the person in possession of the wine and a hearing to be held within 15 days thereafter, if 
requested by any interested party within five days following the notice, the department may seize wine labeled or packaged in 
violation of this section regardless of where found, and may dispose of the wine upon order of the department. From the time of 
notice until the departmental determination, the wine shall not be sold or transferred. “(g) This section applies only to wine which is produced, bottled, or labeled after January 1, 2001.”"
1166,7," 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i) HN3[
] provides: "
1167,," “(i) Geographic brand names. (1) Except as provided in subparagraph 2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be 
used unless the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named. “(2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval issued prior to July 7, 1986: “(i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named; or “(ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in accordance with § 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either: “(A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or; “(B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears a state name; or “(iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the appropriate ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms] 
officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of the 
origin of the wine. “(3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a 
viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, or when found to have viticultural significance by the 
appropriate ATF officer.”"
1167,8," Bronco asserts that the statute was drafted in such a manner as to protect other established Napa County wineries, and to 
target “only a single brand owner—Bronco” (and its three grandfathered brands). The record discloses, however, at least 32 
other Napa-related “grandfathered” brands (none of which, it appears, presently produces any wine that would violate section 
25241) that also would be covered by the statute, including the “Napa named” brands Napa Wine Cellars, Napa Wine Co., Napa 
Cellars, Napa Valley Winery, Napa Vintners, and “Napa viticultural appellation” brands Rutherford Hill, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, 
Stags' Leap Winery, Spring Mountain, Mount Veeder Winery, St. Helena Vineyards, and Oakville Vineyards. Bronco also complains that the statute is underinclusive, in that it does not restrict the use of non-Napa brand names, such as 
“Monterey Vineyards” or “Sonoma Creek,” nor does it preclude the use of brand labels denoting a viticultural area within Napa, 
such as the brand “Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,” for a Napa County wine made with grapes grown outside the Stags Leap District 
of the Napa Valley. (Cf. Bus. & Prof. Code, § 25240 [requiring such labels to state a “Napa Valley” appellation in addition to the 
viticultural area within Napa Valley].) Any such underinclusiveness, however, is irrelevant to our present preemption inquiry."
1167,9," Business and Professions Code section 23090.5 HN4[
] divests the superior court of jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain a decision of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the agency charged with enforcing Business and Professions Code 
section 25241. "
1168,10," Bronco suggests, however, that the state properly may “enact an ‘in-state’ version of section 25241”—a regulation that would, 
presumably, apply only with respect to wine that is not sold in interstate commerce. "
1169,11," Counsel for amici curiae represent, among other entities, more than 68 wineries in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, 
Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
Texas, Virginia, and Washington, as well as 47 wine grape growers in California."
1169,12," Bronco, relying upon two Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decisions ( Lewis v. Brunswick Corp. (11th Cir. 1997) 107 F.3d 
1494, 1502, and  Taylor v. General Motors Corp. (11th Cir. 1989) 875 F.2d 816, 826), and, to a lesser extent, two high court 
decisions ( Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. (2002) 529 U.S. 861, 870–874 [146 L. Ed. 2d 914, 120 S. Ct. 1913] (Geier), and  
Engine Manufacturers Association v. South Coast Air Quality Management District (2004) 541 U.S. 246, 256 [158 L. Ed. 2d 529, 
124 S. Ct. 1756, 1763] (Engine Manufacturers)), also asserts, as a preliminary matter, that the presumption against preemption 
is categorically inapplicable in implied preemption cases such as this, in which the question is whether state law would stand as 
an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. The United States Supreme 
Court has not so held, however, and indeed has assumed otherwise. ( Crosby, supra, 530 U.S. 363, 373–374 & fn. 8.)  Geier, by 
contrast, did not even address the presumption-against-preemption doctrine, and in  Engine Manufacturers the court simply 
found it unnecessary, because of its conclusion that the federal legislation expressly preempted the relevant state law, to 
address the presumption against preemption or even the legislative history of the federal statute. We discern no persuasive 
reason why the traditional presumption against preemption should be categorically inapplicable in the present circumstances, 
and until the high court directs otherwise, we reject Bronco's view on this point. (See, e.g.,  Philip Morris Inc. v. Harshbarger (1st 
Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 58, 85–86 [applying a “strong presumption against preemption” concerning state health and safety 
regulations and finding those regulations not to frustrate congressional purposes].) "
1170,13," At oral argument, as in the Department's briefs, the NVVA maintained that the “relevant area” for purposes of determining 
whether the presumption against preemption is applicable should be viewed as consumer protection related to the labeling of 
foods and beverages in general or, more specifically, as consumer protection related to the labeling of wines. Bronco, although 
generally challenging the appropriateness of applying any presumption against preemption in this case (see ante, fn. 12), does 
not contest the definition of the relevant area for such an inquiry as proposed by the Department and the NVVA. For purposes of 
this opinion, and consistently with the high court's approach in such matters (see, e.g.,  ARC America Corp., supra, 490 U.S. 93, 
101 [in addressing whether federal antitrust law preempts state law, defining the relevant area as “state common-law and 
statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices”]), we view the relevant area as being consumer protection 
related to food and beverage labeling, with special emphasis upon wine labeling. "
1171,14," Some state laws of this era regulated the production and labeling of specific items of food such as flour, butter, 
oleomargarine, and vinegar. (E.g., Hutt & Hutt, A History of Government Regulation of Adulteration and Misbranding of Food 
(1984) 39 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 2, 42–44 [citing and describing early Virginia statutes].) During this same period, Congress 
enacted similar laws concerning specific food items such as tea, oleomargarine, and meats. (Id., at pp. 45–46.)"
1171,15," Citing only the 1895 North Carolina law, Bronco asserts that “some” of these state laws were intended to apply only to food 
and beverages sold within a given state. The North Carolina provision, however, is the only such law of which we are aware to 
have intimated or specified such a limitation; none of the other laws cited above was so confined, and most instead broadly 
applied to foods and beverages that were “manufactured for sale”—wherever that sale would occur. But in any event, the 
relevant point is that the states (most of them broadly, although in the case of North Carolina, narrowly) exercised their 
traditional police powers by specifically regulating the labeling of food products and beverages, including wines. "
1172,16," As of 1890, those three states produced approximately 60, 10, and 8 percent, respectively, of the wine produced in the United 
States. (U.S. Dept. of Interior, Census Off., Rep. of Statistics of Agriculture in the U.S. at the 11th Census: 1890 (1895) p. 602.)"
1172,17," See Pinney, A History of Wine in America (1989) pages 404–405, 420–422 (describing early winemaking in Arkansas and 
Oregon)."
1172,18," As observed ante, footnote 16, by 1890 California produced most of the wine grown and made in the United States. Today, 
according 
to 
the 
Wine 
Institute, 
California 
produces 
more 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
nation's 
wine. 
(See <http://www.wineinstitute.org/communications/statistics/wine_production_key_facts.htm> [as of Aug. 5, 2004].)"
1172,19," See generally, California Wine Industry, supra, at pages 26 (“the French viticultural journal, Revue Viticole, in 1862, credited 
California with being the only wine-producing area of North America capable of competing with the product from Europe”) and 
133 (noting that 35 medals were awarded to California wines at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1889)."
1172,20," In addition—and belying Bronco's claims that this and similar statutes lacked detail—the statute contained various other 
provisions dealing comprehensively with the production and labeling of wine. (See Stats. 1887, ch. 36, §§ 3–6, pp. 47–49.)"
1172,21," The Ex parte Kohler decision proceeded to construe the act's labeling requirements as prohibiting the sale of wines not 
meeting the definition of pure wines under the act, but as not subjecting to penalty a merchant who sells wine that is pure but 
lacks the required labels. ( Ex parte Kohler, supra, 74 Cal. at pp. 44–45.)"
1172,22," (1887 Colo. Sess. Laws, § 2, p. 18 et seq.) The legislation required that wine be “pure”—defined as made from “the juice of 
the grape”—and specified that “[n]o vinous … liquors shall be offered or exposed for sale in this State, unless the … package, 
containing such liquors, shall be plainly” marked with “the word ‘pure’ wine,” and displaying “the name or brand of the particular 
kind of wine so offered or exposed.” (Id., §§ 3 & 4, pp. 18–19.) "
1173,23," (1887 N.Y. Laws, ch. 603, p. 814 et seq.) The New York law was designed to address its specific regional needs as reflected 
in the industry practices of New York winemakers who, like those in Europe and other areas of the United States but unlike 
those in California, often found it necessary to add sugar in the production of their wines. The law defined and made illegal 
adulterated wine, and thereafter defined and required the proper labeling of “pure wine,” “half wine,” and “made wine.” (Id., §§ 1–
4, pp. 814–816.) As Bronco observes, the New York provision, as codified in 1889 (N.Y. Pub. Health Law, ch. 25, art. III, §§ 46–49 (Birdseye 
1889)), referred, in its definition of adulterated wines, to those “offered for sale or manufactured with intent to sell within this 
state.” (Id., § 46.) Bronco asserts this and similar phrasing in the statute's penalty provision (id., § 49) suggests the New York 
statute was intended to apply only to wines sold within the state. There is no evidence that the similar California law mentioned 
above, or the Ohio law mentioned below, was so confined or intended. But in any event, the relevant point is that New York—like 
the other states—exercised its traditional police powers by specifically regulating the labeling of wines."
1173,24," (1889 Ohio Laws, p. 96 et seq.; 1891 Ohio Laws, p. 231.) As amended in 1891, the Ohio law defined three versions of 
permitted wine: “pure wine,” “wine,” and “compound wine,” and specifically allowed sugar to be added to the latter two products. 
The statute provided that each type of wine “shall be … labeled, designated and sold” as such and made it illegal to label or 
package, in a manner “calculated to mislead or deceive any person, or cause to be supposed that the contents thereof be pure 
wine,” any product not meeting the definition of pure wine. (1891 Ohio Laws, §§ 2–4, pp. 231–233.)"
1173,25," (1897 Ark. Acts, act 42, § 4, p. 108.) As subsequently amended (1899 Ark. Acts, act 80, pp. 137–138) and codified (Stats. of 
Ark., ch. 103, § 5101 (Kirby 1904)), the statute provided: “All wine sold in this State shall, before sale, be labeled so as to truly 
designate its kind and quality. Nothing but the pure fermented juice of the grape shall be labeled ‘Natural Wine.’ Wine to which 
sugar has been added before fermentation shall be labeled ‘Sugared Wine.’ The label shall also state if the wine be sweetened 
or unsweetened.”"
1173,26," (1905 Or. Laws, ch. 209, p. 347 et seq.) The Oregon law defined and barred “adulterated wine,” allowed certain amounts of 
sugar to be used in the production of “pure wine,” and defined and permitted “half wine” and “made wine,” so long as those 
products were labeled as such. (Id., §§ 54–56, pp. 361–362.)"
1173,27," See Hearing before the House Committee on Ways and Means, on House Resolution No. 12868, 59th Congress, 1st 
Session, pages 1–60 (Feb. 1, 1906) (February hearings); Second Hearing before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 
59th Congress, 1st Session, pages 61–114 (Apr. 6 & 10, 1906) (April hearings). The proposed legislation would have defined 
wine as “pure,” “carbonated,” or “artificial,” and required labeling as such. (Feb. hearings, supra, at pp. 5–7.) During a second 
committee hearing concerning the bill and a revised version of the bill, the committee made clear that in considering the 
proposed federal legislation it had consulted the related wine laws of France, Italy, Germany, Ohio, New York, “and other 
states.” (Apr. hearings, supra, at pp. 62, 73, 101, 109–112.) A recurring theme during the hearings was the harm posed to the wine industry by the sale of “sophisticated and fabricated 
wines.” The proponents' stated concern was that if the sale of such products were “allowed or countenanced … in time honest 
wine will be driven from the market, … to the injury of the vineyardists … .” (Apr. hearings, supra, at p. 66; see also id., at pp. 
73–74, 102.) That wine labeling legislation, however, died in committee. "
1175,28," The very limited effect of such decisions was described by the issuing entity itself as follows: “The opinions or decisions of this 
Department … are … issued more in an advisory than in a mandatory spirit. It is clear that if the manufacturers, jobbers, and 
dealers interpret the rules and regulations in the same manner as they are interpreted by this Department, and follow that 
interpretation in their business transactions, no prosecution will lie against them. … [¶] It may often occur that the opinion of this 
Department is not that of the manufacturer, jobber, or dealer. In this case there is no obligation resting upon the manufacturer, 
jobber, or dealer to follow the line of procedure marked out or indicated by the opinion of this Department. Each one is entitled to 
his own opinion and interpretation and to assume the responsibility of acting in harmony therewith. …” (F.I.D. No. 44 (Dec. 1, 
1906), reprinted in Gwinn, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Food and Drugs Act (1914) pp. 35–36, italics added; see also American 
Pure Food and Drug Laws, supra, at pp. 16–18; Administration of the Federal Food and Drugs Act, supra, 1 Law & Contemp. 
Probs. at pp. 20–21.) "
1176,29," In addition to the federal prosecution under the 1906 Act that resulted in the decision in  Sweet Valley, supra, 208 F. 85, in 
which the federal district court held that the challenged “pomace wine” product in that case, labeled as German “Select Riesling” 
and “Hochheimer,” was misbranded under both the 1906 Act and the Ohio wine statute—we are aware of one similar wine 
mislabeling prosecution under the 1906 Act ( Sixty Barrels of Wine (D.C.Mo. 1915) 225 F. 846) and three similar federal 
prosecutions concerning bottled “Champagne.” ( Duffy-Mott Co. v. United States (3d. Cir. 1923) 285 F. 737;  Schraubstadter v. 
United States (9th Cir. 1912) 199 F. 568;  United States v. Five Cases of Champagne (N.D.N.Y. 1913) 205 F. 817.) One might 
ask why the Duffy-Mott case arose during Prohibition. The answer is that even during Prohibition, pharmacists were permitted to 
sell “prescription Champagne.” (Byszewski, What's in the Wine? A History of the FDA's Role (2002) 57 Food & Drug J. 544, 
554.)"
1176,30," See Hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on the Pure-Food Bills, 59th Congress, 1st 
Session (Feb. 13, 1906) page 308. Indeed, according to contemporaneous assessments, those states with adequate 
enforcement mechanisms (approximately 20 states) were, by 1906, applying their laws “very rigidly.” (Ibid.) "
1177,31," In this respect, the author of the 1912 treatise relied upon by Bronco observed that “the prohibitions in the California statute … 
against misstatements as to geographical source” were “more detailed” than those under federal law. (American Pure Food and 
Drug Laws, supra, at p. 339.)"
1177,32," In early 1908, California's Department of Public Health adopted comprehensive regulations implementing the 1907 state Act, 
broadly regulating “for domestic commerce” the labeling of foods and beverages and specifically providing that “[t]he label shall 
be free from any statement, design, or device regarding … place of origin, which is false or misleading in any particular.” (Cal. 
Dept. of Pub. Health, Rules and Regs. for Enforcement of Cal. Pure Foods and Drugs Acts (1909) reg. No. 16, p. 22, italics 
added.) Those regulations, as periodically amended, continued in force through at least 1935. (Cal. Dept. of Pub. Health, Rules 
and Regs. for Enforcement of Cal. Pure Foods and Drugs Acts (1928) reg. No. 13(d) & (e), p. 20 [providing as quoted above, 
and further providing that food or beverages shall not be “labeled or branded in such a manner as to deceive or mislead the 
consumer”]; Cal. Dept. of Pub. Health, Rules and Regs. for Enforcement of Cal. Pure Foods and Drugs Acts (1933) reg. No. 
13(d) & (e), p. 18 [same].)"
1177,33," See American Pure Food and Drug Laws, supra, listing, as of 1912, the following additional states that had adopted the 
Secretary of Agriculture's food (and wine) standards, or essentially identical standards: Alabama (at p. 270); Delaware (at p. 
418); Florida (at p. 438); Georgia (at pp. 468–474); Idaho (at p. 499); Illinois (at pp. 524–525); Indiana (at p. 551); Kansas (at pp. 
604–605); Kentucky (at pp. 634–635); Louisiana (at pp. 661–662); Maine (at pp. 680–681); Maryland (at pp. 705–706); 
Mississippi (at pp. 828–829); Missouri (at p. 851); Montana (at p. 880); Nevada (at p. 932); New Hampshire (at p. 952); New 
Jersey (at p. 980); North Carolina (at p. 1051); Oklahoma (at p. 1128); Rhode Island (at pp. 1207–1208); South Dakota (at p. 
1241); Texas (at p. 1285); Utah (at p. 1306); Virginia (at pp. 1350–1351); Wisconsin (at pp. 1416–1417); and Wyoming (at p. 
1441). (See also Interpretative Regulations, supra, 29 Geo. L.J. at p. 13 & fn. 27.)"
1177,34," Effective through at least 1935, the state's 1907 Pure Foods Act continued to adopt—as minimum standards—the federal 
food standards (including the wine standards). (Stats. 1933, ch. 758, § 10, pp. 2001–2002.) "
1178,35," In 1932, anticipating ratification of the repeal of Prohibition, California voters passed a constitutional amendment, providing as 
follows: “HN8[
] The State of California, subject to the internal revenue laws of the United States, shall have the exclusive right 
and power to license and regulate the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession and transportation of alcoholic beverages within 
the State, and subject to the laws of the United States regulating commerce between foreign nations and among the states shall 
have the exclusive right and power to regulate the importation into and exportation from the State, of alcoholic beverages. …” 
(Cal. Const., art XX, § 22, italics added.)"
1178,36," At that same time, the Legislature repealed the 1907 “Cala” wine labeling statute. (See Stats. 1935, ch. 330, § 69, p. 1152; 
Caddow, Permanent Wine Labeling Regulations in Wines & Vines (Feb. 1936) 10.) The 1887 state “pure wine” labeling statute 
(Stats. 1887, ch. 36, p. 46) previously had been repealed in 1911. (Stats. 1911, ch. 587, § 1, p. 1110.) Of course, despite these 
repeals, the state's 1907 Pure Foods Act (Stats. 1907, ch. 181, p. 208 et seq.), which as noted above incorporated specific wine 
standards, and the regulations adopted under the 1907 Act (all described ante, pt. II.B.1.d.), remained in effect and prohibited 
the mislabeling of wine."
1178,37," Contrary to assertions in Bronco's supplemental briefs, there is no indication that the scope of the 1934 regulations was 
limited to wine sold to consumers in California and that the regulations did not address wines destined for interstate commerce."
1178,38," The regulation provided: “Champagne is a light white sparkling wine identical with champagne as made in the Champagne 
district in France in respect to composition and basic manufacturing principle. If the secondary fermentation is not within the 
bottle, there shall be stated in direct conjunction with the word ‘Champagne’ the words ‘Secondary Fermentation in Bulk.’ ” (1934 
Regs., at p. 2.) The regulations also provided specific labeling requirements for artificially carbonated wines: “The word 
‘carbonated’ should be in the same color [and] style of type on the same colored background as the wine described.” (Ibid.)"
1178,39," The regulations also restricted the use, on wine labels, of statements of age and the word “old” (1934 Regs., at pp. 2–3), and 
further required that any product made from pomace be labeled “IMITATION WINE/ Made of Wine Pomace, Water and Sugar” 
(id., at p. 2). "
1179,40," The original Ohio wine law (1889 Ohio Laws, p. 96 et seq.) was, by 1938, codified in Page's Ohio Revised Code Annotated 
(Anderson 1938) title II, chapter 1, sections 5795–5805. Oregon's 1905 wine labeling statute (1905 Or. Laws, ch. 209, §§ 54–56, 
pp. 361–362) was reenacted a decade later (1915 Or. Laws, ch. 343, §§ 41–43, pp. 570–571) and apparently still was effective 
through mid-1937, when Oregon adopted post-Prohibition-repeal wine labeling regulations. (See also Or. Liquor Control Admin. 
(1937) reg. 5(c) [specifically enforcing the California wine regulations discussed above] & 6 [setting forth labeling requirements].)"
1179,41," For example, the food and beverage labeling statutes of Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Washington, described ante, part 
II.B.1.a, each remained in force in 1935, as revised, and each defined as “misbranded” any food or drink label bearing “any 
statement, design or device” that was “false or misleading in any particular,” or any item “falsely branded as to the state or 
country where it was manufactured or produced,” or very similar words to that effect. (See 1932 Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 94, §§ 
186, 187; 1923 N.D. Laws, ch. 222, §§ 4, 6, pp. 289–291; Rev. Stats. of Wash. (Remington 1932) tit. 40, §§ 6145, 6147; see 
also Rev. Stats. of Wash., supra, § 6137 [adopting the federal food standards, including wine standards, as minimum 
standards].) "
1180,," In New York, Colorado, and Arkansas, the previous wine-specific labeling statutes described ante, part II.B.1.b, had given way, 
by 1935, to the states' respective general food and beverage mislabeling/misbranding regulations, all of which regulated both 
food and drink. (See N.Y. Agric. & Mkts. Law, ch. 1, art. 17, § 200 (Cahill 1930); Ann. Stats. of Colo., ch. 1, § 6 (Courtright 1930); 
Stats. of Ark., ch. 69, § 4823 (1919).) There is no indication, with respect to any of these changes in the various states' laws, that 
any diminution of state regulatory authority over the labeling of wines thereby was intended or effected."
1180,42," For the reasons set forth above, we also reject Bronco's related assertion, pressed in its supplemental briefs and at oral 
argument, that no presumption against preemption applies here because, Bronco claims, the states' regulatory activity was 
augmented in the early 20th century by a “significant federal presence.” (See  Locke, supra, 529 U.S. 89, 108 [finding no 
presumption against preemption regarding regulation of maritime vessels].) As explained ante, part II.B.1, prior to adoption of the 
FAA Act in 1935, the federal role with respect to wine label regulation was neither dominant nor particularly significant in 
comparison with that of the states—and in any event, unlike the situation in  Locke, federal activity in the field of wine label 
regulation certainly was not “manifest since the beginning of our Republic.” ( Locke, supra, at p. 99.) "
1181,43," As originally enacted, the statute referred to the “Administrator” of the “Federal Alcohol Administration.” That agency was 
abolished, and its functions were directed to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury through the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) in the Department of the Treasury. (See 27 U.S.C. § 201, Transfer of Functions.) 
Thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) was established in 1972 and given the pertinent functions of 
the Internal Revenue Service with regard to wine regulation. (Ibid.) Subsequently, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 
§ 101) transferred responsibility for the regulation of interstate commerce in alcoholic beverages to a newly formed Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury. (68 Fed.Reg. 3744 (Jan. 24, 2003).) For convenience, and 
because the regulations here at issue were adopted by the BATF, we shall continue to refer in this case to the BATF as the 
responsible regulatory agency."
1181,44," In the Tobacco Inspection Act (Pub.L. No. 74-314 (Aug. 23, 1935) 49 Stat. 731)—enacted six days prior to adoption of the 
FAA Act—Congress used language making very clear its intent to adopt “uniform” national standards that would displace state 
regulation, thereby revealing that when the 74th Congress intended to make its regulation exclusive, it knew how to do so. As 
observed in  Florida Avocado, supra, 373 U.S. 132, 147, with regard to the Tobacco Act, “Congress had declared ‘uniform 
standards of classification and inspection’ to be ‘imperative for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and 
the public interest therein.’ [Citation.] The legislative history was replete with references to a need for ‘uniform’ or ‘official’ "
1182,," standards, which could harmonize the grading and inspection of tobacco at all markets throughout the country. Under the statute 
a single set of standards was to be promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture, ‘and the standards so established would be the 
official standards of the United States for such purpose.’ ” No such language or comparable provision appears in the FAA Act, as 
adopted in 1935."
1182,45," See also House of Representatives Report No. 1542 (74th Cong., 1st Sess.) pages 13–14 (July 17, 1935) (citing the FAA 
Act‘s “relabeling” provision and noting that anticipated regulations would permit “appropriate additional labeling requirements 
imposed by a State pursuant to its own law not in conflict with the Federal requirements”). Bronco asserts that by this relabeling 
provision (see 27 C.F.R. § 4.30(b)(1)) and the cited comment, Congress had in mind only the authority of states, pursuant to the 
Twenty-first Amendment, to impose additional labeling requirements on alcoholic products imported for sale from other states, 
and did not contemplate that a state would be permitted to impose additional labeling requirements on wines destined for 
interstate commerce. We find no persuasive evidence of any such intent, however."
1182,46," Although on occasion we have questioned reliance upon the views of individual legislators as a basis upon which to discern 
the intent of the state Legislature (e.g.,  People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 501, fn. 7 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 680, 950 P.2d 
1035], and cases cited), in the present case Bronco does not challenge Representative Cullen's statements on that ground, and 
we recently observed in  Dowhal, supra, 32 Cal.4th 910, that HN12[
] statements by a single member of Congress “ ‘can 
provide evidence of Congress’ intent.' ” ( Id., at p. 926, fn. 6.) Moreover, in the present case there are strong reasons to rely 
upon the quoted statements. Representative Cullen was the author of the FAA Act, and was looked upon as an authority during 
the House debates, fielding many questions from his colleagues. (E.g., Remarks of Rep. Doughton, 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11713 
[Rep. Doughton, author of a prior version of the bill, observing on the House floor that Rep. Cullen “is more familiar with the 
provisions of this bill than myself or perhaps any other member … . He has given much study to the bill and is better qualified to 
explain it than I am … .”]; id., pp. 11715–11718, 11727–11730, 11737, 11790, 11792–11793, 11797, 11799 [Rep. Cullen's 
various responses to questions, etc.].) In addition, Representative Cullen's comments essentially reiterated that which was set 
out in the House Report of the Ways and Means Committee, cited in the text above—and later incorporated into the Senate 
Report of the Committee on Finance on House Resolution No. 8870 (Fed. Alcohol Control Admin., Legis. History of Fed. Alcohol 
Admin. Act (Sept. 15, 1935) appen. IV, p. 166), and hence the cited comments did not amount merely to expressions of personal 
opinion. ( In re Marriage of Bouquet (1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 590 [128 Cal. Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371].) "
1183,47," See California Department of Public Health, Weekly Bulletin (Feb. 19, 1938) page 14; id., at page 13 (describing enforcement 
of the California wine quality standards and noting their adoption by the beverage control authorities in Oregon, Virginia, and 
Arizona); see also Thirty-sixth Biennial Report of the California Department of Public Health (Sept. 1940) page 177; Thirty-fifth 
Biennial Report of the California Department of Public Health (Sept. 1938) page 142; Thirty-fourth Biennial Report of the 
California Department of Public Health (Sept. 1936) page 100."
1183,48," “HN14[
] Composition” refers to the ingredients used to make a wine (27 C.F.R. § 4.34) and generally consists simply of grapes. “Method of manufacture” refers to approved wine treatment materials and processes. (27 C.F.R. § 24.175 et seq.) 
“Designation of wines” is a concept distinct from brand name or appellation; it refers to the class or type of wine rather than the 
source or origin of the wine. (27 C.F.R. §§ 4.32(a)(2), 4.34.) For example, a wine may be designated by class as a grape wine, 
sparkling grape wine, or carbonated grape wine (27 C.F.R. § 4.21), or by the grape varietal. (27 C.F.R. §§ 4.23, 4.24, 4.28.) As Bronco concedes, California long has enforced regulations that differ from the federal regulations with respect to method of 
manufacture. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, §§ 17005 [providing, concerning “cellar treatment,” that “[i]n case of conflict 
between Federal and State laws or regulations the California law or regulation shall take precedence”], 17010 [adopting 
regulations more restrictive than those contained in federal regulations concerning the use of sugar in the production or cellar 
treatment of wine].) Bronco contrasts what it asserts are these and similar permissible and specifically sanctioned departures "
1184,," from federal regulations with what it contends are impermissible deviations from federal labeling standards—especially federal 
regulations concerning the use of brand names on labels."
1184,49," This requirement may have gone into effect earlier than 1942. A predecessor to the regulations of 1942 had been adopted in 
April 1940. (See 1942 Regs., cover page [“These regulations supersede the Definitions and Standards—Wines, adopted 
December 1934, as amended, and Rules Governing California Vintage Wines, adopted April 6, 1940”].) The December 1934 
regulations, as amended through January 18, 1936, have been described ante, part II.B.1.d. Despite the efforts of librarians 
throughout the state, we have been unable to locate the intervening regulations—if indeed there were any—or the 1940 Rules 
Governing California Vintage Wines. Article III, section 12(1) of the 1942 Regulations also provided, consistently with many of the prior statutes and regulations 
described earlier, that wine labels “shall not contain [¶] (1) any statement, design, device or representation which is false or 
misleading in any material particular.” (Italics added.)"
1184,50," That California regulation, as adopted in the early 1940s, was in force until the mid-1980s. (See former Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 
17, §§ 17001(a) & 17075(c)(2) (1978).) Oregon as well had a similar “coined” brand-name provision until the mid-1980s. (See 
Or. Admin. R. 845-10-285(3)(a) (1978).)"
1184,51," The appellation “California Central Coast counties” has since fallen into disuse. (See Regulation of American Wine Labeling, 
supra, 11 U.C. Davis L.Rev. at p. 143.) "
1185,52," See Statutes 1939, chapter 60 (establishing the Health & Safety Code), page 992 (enacting former § 26541, requiring that 
certain state food and distilled spirits regulations not impose a standard higher than certain federal regulations—but not requiring 
such conformity with regard to state wine regulations); Statutes 1941, chapter 1042, section 3, page 2698 (enacting former § 
26540.2, authorizing the State Board of Health to promulgate wine regulations), and section 4, page 2699 (amending § 26541 to 
specify that the section's general prohibition on imposition of higher state standards concerning food and distilled spirits “shall 
not apply to wine”). (Italics added.) Former section 26541‘s exemption of state wine regulations from the general rule against 
imposition of higher state standards relating to other foods and distilled spirits continued through various amendments of that 
former section, until that exemption ultimately was recast in 1970 as a positive right of state regulators to “differ from or be 
inconsistent with” corresponding federal wine regulations. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1573, § 5, p. 3255; see post, fn. 53 [quoting current 
Health & Saf. Code, § 110525]; cf.  44 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 122, 125 (1964) [discussing similar history of Health & Saf. Code, 
former § 26542].)"
1185,53," In 1970, Health and Safety Code former section 26515 was amended to specify: “Standards of identity and quality for wine 
adopted pursuant to this section may differ from or be inconsistent with the standards promulgated by [the federal regulators in 
the Department of the Treasury].” (Stats. 1970, ch. 1573, § 5, p. 3255, italics added.) The statute today provides the same. 
(Health & Saf. Code, § 110525 HN15[
] [“Standards of identity and quality for wine adopted pursuant to this section may differ from or be inconsistent with the standards promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Federal Alcohol 
Administration Act”].)"
1185,54," Indeed, other jurisdictions, since 1976, expressly have recognized and incorporated California's more stringent “100 percent 
rule” into their own state wine regulations (see 16 Tex. Admin. Code, § 45.45(b) & (c) (eff. Jan. 1976) [“all grape wine bearing 
labels showing ‘California’ as the origin of such wine shall be derived 100 % from grapes grown and wine from such grapes 
fermented within the State of California”]; Wash. Admin. Code, § 314-24-003(5) [same]), and the federal regulating body itself 
has recognized California's “100 percent rule” as a valid exercise of state regulatory power. (See 58 Fed.Reg. 65295, 65297 
(Dec. 14, 1993) [acknowledging “California's authority to enforce its own labeling requirements within the area of its 
jurisdiction”].)"
1185,55," Under the then existing federal regulations, use of geographic brand names was permitted if (i) the word ?brand” appeared 
after the brand name (27 C.F.R. § 4.33(b) (1976)) or (ii) at least 75 percent of the grapes originated in the appellation suggested 
by the brand name (id., § 4.25 (1976))."
1185,56," Although the BATF in 1978 adopted new rules regulating the use in brand names of terms of geographic or viticultural 
significance, it delayed implementation of those rules, first until 1983 and ultimately until 1986. (43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37674, 
37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).) The brand-name rules that were adopted in 1978 (but never became effective) would have provided: “A 
brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the bottling winery is located within the geographical area used in 
the brand name, and the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the area named” (meaning at least 75 percent of "
1186,," the grapes used to make the wine must be from that area). (43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).) Alternatively, the 1978 
regulation, as initially adopted, would have permitted use of a brand name of viticultural significance if “the brand name is 
qualified by the word ‘brand’ immediately following the brand name in the same size of type and as conspicuous as the brand 
name itself.” (Ibid.) As noted, implementation of the brand-name aspects of the rules repeatedly was delayed. (See 48 Fed.Reg. 2762 (Jan. 21, 
1983); 50 Fed.Reg. 758 (Jan. 7, 1985).) Meanwhile, in 1984 the BATF retreated from its 1978 proposal concerning the use of 
brand names and proposed instead to address the issue by adopting either that plan, or one of three alternative plans. (49 
Fed.Reg. 19330, 19331–19332 (May 7, 1984); see post, fn. 70 [describing the BATF's 1984 comments concerning proposed 
branding rules].) As explained below, based upon further review and the comments concerning its 1984 proposal, the BATF 
ultimately adopted, effective July 7, 1986, the regulation at issue in the present case. (51 Fed.Reg. 20480 (June 5, 1986).)"
1186,57," An “appellation of origin” was, and continues to be, defined as a political division or subdivision—for example, a state, or 
group of states, or a county, or group of counties—in which grapes used to make a wine are grown. (See 27 C.F.R. § 
4.25(a)(1)(i)-(vi).) A “viticultural area,” by contrast, is a special subcategory within an appellation of origin (see 27 C.F.R. § 
4.25(a)(1)(vi)) demarked not by political boundaries, but by geographic terms and characteristics."
1186,58," The other requirements for “viticultural area appellation” labeling were (and remain) (i) that the area be recognized under part 
9 of 27 Code of Federal Regulations; (ii) that the wine be made from at least 85 percent grapes grown in that viticultural area; 
and (iii) that the wine be fully “finished” within the state (or one of the states) of the viticultural area. (27 C.F.R. § 4.25(e)(3)(i), (ii) 
& (iv).)"
1186,59," An administrative regulation of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (former Or. Admin. R. 845-10-292(6)(c), eff. Mar. 1, 
1977, currently Or. Admin. R. 845-010-0920(1) & (2) (2004)), requires: “(1) An appellation of origin must appear on every wine 
brand label in direct conjunction with, and in lettering as conspicuous as, the wine's class or type designation. The lettering must 
be at least two millimeters in height. [¶] (2) No person may sell or offer to sell a wine, claiming or implying a certain appellation of 
origin anywhere on its label, unless 100 percent of the grapes used in its production grew within the legal boundaries of that 
appellation of origin. …” The corresponding federal regulations, by contrast, impose only a 75 percent rule for appellations of 
origin (27 C.F.R. § 4.25(b)(1)(i)), an 85 percent rule for American viticultural areas (27 C.F.R. § 4.25(e)(3)(ii)), and a 95 percent 
rule for individual vineyard appellations (27 C.F.R. § 4.39(m))."
1186,60," Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(5), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-
0930 (2004) (barring use of “semi-generic” place names [such as Burgundy, Chablis, and Chianti] on Oregon wine labels) with 
27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.24(b)(2) (permitting those same names on federally approved labels)."
1186,61," Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(3)(a), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-
010-0915(1) (2004) (a varietal name [such as Chardonnay or Pinot Noir] may not be used on an Oregon wine label unless at 
least 90 percent of the wine's grapes are of that varietal) with 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.23(b) (permitting use of 
a varietal name on federally approved labels if only 75 percent of the wine's grapes are of that varietal)."
1186,62," Compare Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(4)(c), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-
010-0925 (2004) (barring use of the term “estate bottled” on Oregon wine labels unless, among other things, the wine's grapes "
1187,," were grown within five miles of the winery) with 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.26 (permitting the term “estate bottled” 
on federally approved labels without requiring that the wine's grapes have been grown within five miles of the winery)."
1187,63," See Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(6)(e), effective March 1, 1977, currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-
0920(4)(f) (2004), discussed in the text, post."
1187,64," See Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-290(2) (1977), currently Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0290(2) (2004) 
(providing that each wine label must (i) receive a federal COLA and (ii) comply with the more stringent Oregon rules concerning 
percentage contents for appellations of origin, semi-generic names, grape content of varietal wines, brand names, and use of 
the term “estate bottled”)."
1187,65," We note the narrowness of this grandfather provision compared with the federal grandfather clause that we consider in the 
present case. In addition to the earlier cutoff date (1977 under the state regulation, as compared with 1986 under the federal 
regulation), the phrasing of the provision suggests that the right of grandfathered use may not be transferred to another entity, as 
was done in the present case. (Cf. Comment, On Vino Veritas Clarifying the Use of Geographic References on American Wine 
Labels (2001)  89 Cal. L.Rev. 1881, 1912–1913.)"
1187,66," As most recently amended, the regulation provides that appellation names—again including the names of Oregon counties, 
and the names of Oregon wine-producing regions Willamette Valley, Umpqua Valley, and Rogue Valley or “words that may be 
mistaken for an approved appellation of origin in a brand name [or] in a winery name, or in any other manner on a wine label” 
may not be used “unless the wine meets the requirements for use of that appellation of origin” (Or. Admin. R. 845-010-0920(4)(f) 
(2004)), that is, “100 percent of the grapes used in its production grew within the legal boundaries of that appellation of origin.” 
(Id., 845-010-0920(2) (2004).) Like the original version of the regulation, the provision also retains a restrictive grandfather 
clause: “A winery may continue to use any brand name that it has used on its approved label since before January 1, 1977.” (Id., 
845-010-0920(4)(f) (2004), italics added.)"
1187,67," We reject Bronco's preliminary argument, raised in its supplemental briefs, that Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0280 
implicitly nullifies Oregon wine regulations discussed above, such as the estate-bottled provision and the geographic brand-
name provision. The cited rule addresses “Standards of Identity and Prohibited Practices Concerning Wine” and provides that Oregon regulations 
concerning those two topics, set forth in Oregon Administrative Rule “845-010-0905 [definitions] and 845-010-0940 [use of 
water, wine spirits and other sweetening agents],” shall prevail over any less stringent or restrictive federal law. (Or. Admin. R. 
845-010-0280 (2004), italics added.) As Bronco observes, in an introductory sentence the regulation also states: “The 
Commission adopts, by reference, 27 CFR [parts] 4 [the federal wine labeling regulations] and 24[] [wineries and wine-making 
regulations] (1986). These regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco [] and Firearms of the United States Department of 
Treasury apply to all wine sold in Oregon by a Commission licensee.” (Ibid.) "
1188,," Bronco reads this language as adopting generally the federal regulations concerning, for example, the use of the term “estate 
bottled” and geographic brand names for all Oregon wines sold in that state—and hence as implicitly repealing or at least 
superseding those Oregon rules insofar as in-state sales of Oregon wines are concerned. Bronco's interpretation of the Oregon 
rules is belied by Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0910(2) (2004), which plainly states that Oregon Administrative Rules 
“845-010-0905 through 845-010-0940 [i.e., including Oregon's estate-bottled and geographic brand-name provisions] apply to all 
grape wines produced or bottled in Oregon …”—that is, regardless where such wines are sold—and that “[t]hese rules prevail in 
any conflict between … other rules in Chapter 845, Division 010.” (Italics added.)"
1188,68," As the BATF explained, prior to adoption of its 1978 appellation rules, appellations of origin relating to American wines 
generally were characterized as regions or places delimited by political boundaries, such as states or counties. As observed 
ante, at footnote 57, the 1978 appellation rules expanded the concept of appellations of origin by additionally including under 
that term “viticultural areas”—that is, grape-growing regions—defined by geographic features, and not political lines. Because 
some of these viticultural areas straddled states, a problem eventually arose concerning the federal requirement, then set out in 
27 Code of Federal Regulations former section 4.25a(e)(3)(v) (1981–1986), that in order to employ a viticultural area 
designation, a winery must “conform[] to the laws and regulations of all the States contained in the viticultural area.” Specifically, 
the BATF noted (51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986)), if a wine were to use the viticultural area designation “Columbia 
Valley” (a federally recognized viticultural area straddling Oregon and Washington), the winery producing the wine would be 
required to comply with Oregon's state regulations, even if the grapes were grown in the Washington part of the Columbia Valley 
and the wine was made and finished only in Washington. Moreover, the BATF observed, “regulations of Oregon and Washington 
differ greatly regarding the production and labeling of wine. Oregon regulations are more stringent than Federal regulations.” (51 
Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics added.) The BATF observed that because former section “4.25a(e)(3)(v) required 
compliance with laws and regulations of all states within a multistate viticultural area, regardless of where the wine is fermented 
or finished, wine made from grapes originating and fermented in Washington, and finished and bottled within Washington was, 
nevertheless, subjected to Oregon law and regulations if the wine claimed a multistate viticultural area appellation such as 
Columbia Valley.” (51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986).) And yet, the BATF determined, “[a] Federal requirement for 
compliance with State laws and regulations is both unnecessary and difficult for the Federal Government to enforce due to the 
multitude of state and local laws and regulations.” (Ibid., italics added.) Accordingly, the BATF concluded, it did not “believe that 
Federal regulation should impose the State laws or regulations of one state upon transactions occurring in other states.” (Ibid.)"
1188,69," Underscoring this point, the BATF observed in the summary of its decision that although “the requirement to comply with 
State laws and regulations is removed as a Federal requirement,” still, “[t]he State laws and regulations remain in effect and will "
1189,," continue to be enforced by the agencies of the states involved in winemaking.” (51 Fed.Reg. 3773 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics 
added.)"
1189,70," See 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i), quoted in full ante, at footnote 7. As Bronco observes, in a notice of 
proposed rulemaking issued in 1984—two years prior to the BATF's adoption of the present brand-name provision and its 
grandfather clause—the BATF stated that it did not wish to adopt a regulation that “may be too restrictive.” (49 Fed.Reg. 19330, 
19331 (May 7, 1984).) After outlining four possible regulatory responses to the brand-name problem, the BATF stated, in 
reference to a possible rule strictly regulating the use of terms of viticultural significance in brand names, its “belie[f that] the wine 
industry should be allowed flexibility in selecting brand names under which to market their products without having a whole class 
of brand names become totally unusable.” (Id., at pp. 19331–19332, italics added.) As explained post, part II.D.1, Bronco 
suggests that this language supports a conclusion that two years later, when the BATF adopted 27 Code of Federal Regulations 
section 4.39(i)(2)(ii) and concluded that the new rule “will provide the industry with sufficient flexibility in designing their labels, 
while at the same time providing consumers with protection from any misleading impressions that might arise from the use of 
geographic brand names” (51 Fed.Reg. 20480, 20482 (June 5, 1986)), the BATF, in so acting, engaged in a “careful balancing 
of federal policy objectives” and intended to allow the kind of brand-name labeling here at issue. "
1193,71," We note that the BATF has not been reluctant to commit its thoughts to public view through publication of proposed rules and 
related comments in the Federal Register."
1193,72," For similar reasons, we find unpersuasive the related arguments of amici curiae on behalf of Bronco that section 25241 
stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, because the statute 
assertedly (i) “impairs the long-standing national policy favoring uniform and consistent federal wine labeling regulations,” (ii) 
“impairs the consistent federal policy permitting continued use of established brands,” and (iii) “will frustrate the United States' 
ability to protect established brands and trademarks in ongoing trade negotiations.” "

nationwide market-share based on the 'personal experience' of its sales director.'"" Equifax's Evid. Objections at 1. Likewise, 
Equifax objects to Knievel's statement that ""[in] 2000 & 2001, I estimate the percentage of single file credit reports sold to auto 
dealers by Equifax direct vs. by Equifax through resellers was 50%."" Knievel Decl. P 12. Knievel cites as a basis for his 
estimates of market  [*12] share the knowledge he gained from his personal experience as CCA's Director of Sales over a four-
year period, and the fact that ""a very important part of my job is to know which credit bureau(s) are used by automobile dealers, 
as well as the pricing for credit reports by our competitors."" Knievel Decl. P 6. Equifax's objection is overruled on the ground that 
the Knievel declaration is proper lay opinion testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 701 and 702, cf. Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 149. 
While Knievel's estimate of market share may not be as reliable as expert testimony, such considerations apply to the weight if 
any, to be accorded the evidence by the jury, rather than admissibility. "
1200,4," Equifax objects to Jeffrey Briggs' testimony regarding what Equifax sales representative Kathy Weismann said to him as 
inadmissible hearsay. The Court overrules Equifax's objection on the ground that Weismann's statements are admissions of a 
party."
1200,5," Equifax objects to this evidence as inadmissible speculation on the ground that ""none of these witnesses have ever seen any 
lender policies requiring Equifax reports  [*15] and have never even spoken to lenders about these alleged requirements … but 
base this statement on the fact that certain unnamed car dealers"" told the witnesses that lenders required Equifax reports. 
Equifax's Evid. Objections at 2. Matthew Briggs states that the basis for his conclusion that lenders require Equifax reports is his 
""interaction and dealing with well over a thousand automobile dealers over the last four years, including review of invoices, 
review of systems which deliver credit reports, and conversations with general managers, sales managers, and finance 
managers."" M. Briggs Decl. P 10. The Court concludes that this evidence is admissible. Matthew Briggs provides adequate foundation for his testimony based on 
his experience and his conversations with multiple customers that lenders to his customers require Equifax reports. The Court 
concludes that this testimony is ""rationally based on [Matthew Briggs'] perception[s],"" ""helpful to a … determination of a fact in 
issue,"" and ""not based on scientific technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702."" See Fed. R. Evid. 
701. The testimony at issue is not dependent on ""specialized observations, the specialized  [*16] translation of those 
observations into theory … or the application of such a theory in a particular case."" Consequently, the testimony does not fall 
within the scope of Fed. R. Evid. 702. Cf. Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 149, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 
238 (1999). Accordingly, Equifax's objections are overruled. "
1201,6," Equifax objects to the admissibility of this evidence, arguing that no foundation has been laid to show that this testimony, and 
similar declaration testimony from Matthew Briggs, are based on personal knowledge. Evid. Objection at 3. The Court concludes 
that the declarations of Jeffrey Briggs and Matthew Brings are admissible for the purpose of establishing that the declarants only 
encountered the aforementioned resellers in the market. See Fed. R. Evid. 602 and Fed. R. Evid. 703. Accordingly, Equifax's 
objections are overruled."
1201,7," The term ""Beacon"" refers to Equifax's credit-scoring service,  [*19] while the term ""Safescan"" refers to an Equifax anti-fraud 
service designed to confirm a credit applicant's identity. See, e.g., Compl. P 31. "
1202,8," Equifax also argues that even if the separate schedule of prices contained in the March 22, 2000 e-mail was made part of the 
agreement, Equifax was free to change those prices pursuant to the language in the April 1, 2000  [*22] agreement that ""Broker 
will pay Equifax promptly … according to the rate schedule of cash prices now or subsequently established by Equifax."" Plaintiff 
responds that the March 22, 2000 e-mail gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the pricing schedule 
established by the earlier e-mail was to remain in place for two years. "
1203,9," Equifax contends that its decision to terminate its relationship with CCA was not the result of a price-fixing conspiracy, but 
rather a decision to overhaul its distribution strategy. According to Equifax, in mid-2001, it undertook a review of its pricing 
strategies regarding its various distribution channels.  [*24] Equifax contends that during the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2000, 
CCA sold 209,322 credit reports, while resellers such as ADP and CREDCO sold over a million Equifax credit reports. 
Weismann Decl. P 8, Lovvorn Decl. P 13. Equifax asserts that CCA and other brokers were using volume discounts from 
Equifax to induce customers who were purchasing Equifax reports directly from Equifax to buy through brokers instead. Lovvorn 
Decl. P 7. Therefore, Equifax unilaterally implemented a pricing strategy in which it charged brokers a flat fee of $ 2.75 per 
report, with exceptions for ""a limited number of large-volume brokers that offered added value to Equifax, such as expanding 
Equifax's market base."" Lovvorn Decl. P 9. According to Equifax, ""CCA was one of at least sixty brokers who received notice of 
the discontinuation of volume discounts."" Lovvorn Decl. P 10."
1203,10," Equifax objects to this evidence as speculative, lacking foundation, and as violative of the best evidence rule. Matthew Briggs 
states that ""after Equifax terminated CCA, in order to document the information I knew to be true from personal experience, I 
directed my staff to obtain simultaneous price quotes for a single-file credit report directly from Equifax for end users in the price 
inflated market …"" Equifax price quotes are attached to the Declaration of Matthew Briggs as Exhibits F-J. The objections to the 
Briggs Declaration on the grounds of speculation and lack of foundation are overruled. Because the written price quotes are 
themselves admissible evidence, Equifax's objection that Briggs' summary of the price quote is inadmissible pursuant to the Fed. 
R. Evid. 1002  [*27] (the ""best evidence rule"") is also overruled. "
1204,11," In its motion papers, Equifax relies on case law interpreting and applying the Sherman Act, as does plaintiff. These 
 [*28] authorities maybe persuasive, but are not necessarily controlling in a Cartwright Act case. See, e.g., Knevelbaard Dairies 
v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir. 2000) (""[F]ederal antitrust precedents [interpreting the Sherman Act] are properly 
included in a Cartwright Act analysis, but their role is limited: they are 'often helpful' but not necessarily decisive."")."
1204,12," In McCready, the Court concluded that subscribers to a group health insurance plan suffered antitrust injury pursuant to an 
anticompetitive scheme in which they were unlawfully ""compelled to choose between visiting a psychologist and forfeiting 
reimbursement, or receiving reimbursement by foregoing treatment by the practitioner of their choice."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 
483. The Court explained that such injury would have been either: (1) ""borne in the first instance  [*30] by the competitors of the 
conspirators, and inevitably -- though indirectly -- by the customers of the competitors in the form of suppressed competition in 
the psychotherapy market;"" or (2) ""as it happened … borne directly by the customers of the competitors"" in the form of increase 
in the cost of psychologists' services. McCready, 457 U.S. at 483. The Supreme Court further elaborated that while ""McCready 
was not a competitor of the conspirators, the injury she suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators 
sought to inflict on psychologists and the psychotherapy market."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 484. "
1205,13," In the context of a vertical, maximum resale price restraint, the Court reasoned that, while dealers and manufacturers may 
suffer antitrust injury, ""[a] competitor is not injured by the anticompetitive effects  [*31] of vertical maximum price-fixing, and does 
not have any incentive to vindicate the legitimate interests of a rival's dealer"" because ""the competitor would benefit from such a 
situation."" Atlantic Richfield., 495 U.S. at 345. (emphasis in original). ""Instead, a competitor will be motivated to bring suit only 
when the vertical restraint promotes interbrand competition between the competitor and the dealer subject to the restraint"" such 
that ""a competitor will be injured and hence motivated to sue only when a vertical, maximum-price-fixing arrangement has a 
procompetitive impact on the market."" Id. (emphasis in original). "
1206,14," CCA argues that it is settled law that a competitor driven out of the market by anticompetitive acts of another competitor has 
antitrust standing. CCA's Supp. Brief at 1, citing Amarel v. Gover Connell, 102 F.3d 1494, 1508 (9th Cir. 1996), and Glenn Holly 
Entertainment Inc. v. Tektronix Inc., 352 F.3d 367, 372 (9th Cir. 2002) "
1207,15," In particular, Equifax argues that its decision to eliminate volume pricing to brokers in October 2001 was ""the result of a careful 
analysis of the costs and benefits of its reseller distribution channels and an attempt to impose greater consistency in those 
channels. Reply at 12. In particular, Equifax asserts that its decision to eliminate volume pricing was driven by the ""perception 
that certain brokers, such as CCA and NCC, instead of expanding Equifax's customer base in markets or areas underserved by 
Equifax, were instead simply using their  [*42] volume discounts to take customers that had already been cultivated by Equifax's 
direct sales efforts."" Id. Equifax therefore argues that its actions were intended to make Equifax a more effective competitor 
against TransUnion and Experian."
1207,16," In Dimidowich, the Ninth Circuit determined that in the context of a dual distribution relationship, nonprice restraints were to be 
treated as vertical restraints, subject to rule of reason analysis. However, in so ruling, the court cautioned that: ""[o]nly when there 
is a possibility that the restraint in the market in which there is a horizontal relationship will [have] significant procompetitive "
1208,," effects in the other market, as is the case when the markets are for the service and distribution of the same product, is rule of 
reason analysis appropriate."" Dimidowich, 803 F.2d at 1481. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in Dimidowich and Krehl 
v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F. 2d 1348 (9th Cir. 1982), suggests that a restraint which would otherwise be viewed as 
vertical is not transformed into a horizontal restraint by virtue of the existence of a dual distribution arrangement. See Areeda P 
1605(c) at 74 (""[I]f preventing free riding,  [*43] assuring specialization or efficiency of scale, or precluding use of untrained 
subdealers justifies a conventional vertical restraint, it does so under dual distribution as well. In general, a manufacturer's 
presence at the dealer level merely changes the identity of one of the dealerships without altering, price, output, or other 
significant economic variables."") See also Illinois Corporate Travel, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 889 F.2d 751, 753 (7th Cir. 
1989) (""Dual distribution therefore does not subject to the per se ban a practice that would be lawful if the manufacturer were not 
selling direct to customers; antitrust laws encourage rather than forbid this extra competition"")."
1208,17," See also Areeda P 1605d at 77 (""Of course, resale price maintenance is unlawful per se, but the existence vel non of dual 
distribution rarely has any bearing on that determination."")."
1208,18," See also Areeda P 308 at 98, cautioning that Matsushita ""should not be read, however, to suggest that given evidence must 
be treated precisely the same way in all cases. On the contrary as the Court stated, the 'range of permissible conclusions' that a 
fact finder might draw becomes larger as the alleged conspiracy becomes more economically plausible."" "
1209,19," Equifax contends that CCA's evidence ""is almost entirely inadmissible"" and objects to much of the declarations and deposition 
testimony relied upon by CCA. See Equifax's Evid. Objs. at 1. In particular, Equifax argues that deposition testimony from third-
party resellers, such as Consortium, describing statements by Equifax representatives about discussions between Equifax and 
ADP is inadmissible hearsay. Equifax's Evid. Objs. at 4. Equifax further argues that for this hearsay to be admissible pursuant to 
Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), CCA has to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy exists. Equifax's Evid. Objs. 
at 3, citing United States v. Bowman, 215 F.3d 951, 960-961 (9th Cir. 2000). Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) provides that a statement is nonhearsay if it is made ""by a coconspirator of a party during the course 
of and in furtherance of the conspiracy."" The existence of a conspiracy and the participation of the declarant in the conspiracy 
are preliminary questions of fact that must be resolved by the judge alone. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175-176, 
107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987). ""The court is not bound by the rules of evidence in assessing  [*52] a proffered 
coconspirator statement,"" but the court may not consider evidence which would be barred on the grounds of privilege. 5 Jack 
Weinstein & Margaret Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 801.34[6][a] (Joseph McLaughlin, editor, Matthew Bender 2d ed. 
2004). In addition, ""[t]he Ninth Circuit has stated that evidence of the co-conspirator's statements may be [conditionally] 
admitted, subject to subsequent 'connecting up' through evidence establishing that there was a conspiracy, and the order of "
1210,," proof is a matter for the trial judge's discretion."" 5 Weinstein & Berger, supra § 801.34[6][c], citing United States v. Perez, 658 
F.2d 654, 658 (9th Cir. 1981). Therefore, on a motion for summary judgement the Court may conditionally consider hearsay evidence, subject to a subsequent 
determination as to whether plaintiffs can prove the existence of the conspiracy as well as the participation of the declarant in the 
conspiracy. In addition, the Court concludes that the statement by Equifax executive Kaltenbach is admissible as an admission by a party. 
See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D). A statement is not hearsay if that statement was made ""by the party's agent or servant 
concerning a matter  [*53] within the scope of the agency of employment, made during the existence of the relationship."" Id. 
Therefore Equifax's objections on the grounds of hearsay, speculation, lack of personal knowledge, and lack of foundation are 
overruled."
1210,20," Equifax objects to the deposition testimony of Grayson Sackett on the grounds that it is hearsay, speculative and lacks 
foundation. The Court overrules this objection on the ground that Equifax executive John Harvey's statements constitute an 
admission of a party pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)."
1210,21," Equifax objects to Jeffrey Briggs' testimony regarding what Equifax sales representative Kathy Weismann said to him as 
inadmissible hearsay. The Court overrules Equifax's objection on the ground that Weismann's statements are admissions of a 
party."
1210,22," Equifax objects to the Supplemental Briggs declaration as untimely pursuant to Local Rule 7-9. However, the Court, in its 
discretion, will accept this late-filed declaration. Equifax also objects to CCA's evidence of Equifax's pricing to a reseller outside 
the market at issue on the ground that such evidence violates Fed. R. Evid. 1002 (the best evidence rule). The Court concludes 
that information regarding  [*54] Equifax's pricing to Certified ""was under the control of the party against whom offered,"" [i.e. 
Equifax] pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 1004(3), and is therefore admissible unless Equifax chooses to produce the original 
documents. See Fed. R. Evid. 1004(3). In addition, because the Supplemental Briggs declaration summarizes Equifax's pricing 
to a reseller outside the market at issue (as opposed to pricing to end-users), the Court concludes that the evidence Equifax 
seeks to introduce ""is not closely related to a controlling issue"" such that pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 1004(4), the best evidence 
rule does not apply. See Fed. R. Evid. 1004(4) (evidence summarizing a written document is admissible if the written document 
concerns collateral matters). Accordingly, Equifax's objection is overruled. "
1211,23," Equifax contends that the e-mail to Certified is ""taken out of context"" by CCA and that ""Ms. Weismann was informing Certified 
that if Certified sold as a broker into the automotive channel, it would be charged by Equifax the same $ 2.75 that other such 
brokers, including CCA was charged."" See Equifax's Reply to Supp. Decl. of J. Briggs at 1. Equifax also argues that the ""e-mail 
describes at best --  [*55] and like all of CCA's other evidence -- only a unilateral direction given to Certified, not any form of 
agreement."" Id."
1211,24," Equifax argues that this evidence, interpreted in a light most favorable to CCA, can only imply that ""a potential unilateral price 
policy [was] being considered at Equifax and that no specific agreement, or even policy was ever proposed."" Reply at 6. "
1212,25," Equifax relies on O.S.C. v. Apple Computer, Inc., 792 F.2d 1464, 1468-1469 (1986), in support of the contention that CCA has 
failed to set forth sufficient evidence to support an inference of a conspiracy. In Apple Computer, the Ninth Circuit concluded that 
""Apple's only concern with prices pertained to its dealers' capacity to withstand erosion of profit margins caused by having to 
carry 'free riding' mail order dealers."" Apple Computer, 792 F.2d at 1468. In Apple Computer, the Ninth Circuit noted that while it 
was undisputed that Apple ""received voluminous complaints from its dealers,"" there was ""no evidence that Apple coerced 
dealers on advertising or pricing decisions"" and there was ""no evidence that price discounting was a formal topic of discussion at 
meetings attended by Apple  [*61] representatives."" Apple Computer, 792 F.2d at 1468-1469. Equifax also relies upon the unpublished memorandum opinion in Glacier Optical, Inc. v. Optique Du Monde, 1995 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 1108, 1995 WL 21565 (9th Cir. 1995). Putting aside the fact that this unpublished opinion cannot be relied upon by the 
Court or the parties pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3, the case is distinguishable from the evidence presented here. Equifax 
argues that in Glacier, the plaintiff had set forth evidence of price fixing which consisted of (1) distributors' complaints to 
defendant about plaintiff's sales to discounters; (2) threats to terminate distributors who sold to discounters; (3) defendant's 
monitoring and investigation of possible sales to discounters; (4) meetings with distributors to discuss discounting; and (5) the 
unexplained termination of the plaintiff; and that the Ninth Circuit concluded that such evidence was insufficient to support an 
inference of price-fixing. See Equifax's Supp. Brief, Ex. B (""9th Circuit Case Comparison Chart""). The court in Glacier Optical 
reasoned that defendant had ""proffered a legitimate business explanation"" to explain its efforts to prevent sales to discount 
retailers -- namely, protecting  [*62] the image of the designer eyeglasses that defendant was seeking to distribute -- and 
therefore the evidence did not support an inference of price-fixing. Glacier Optical, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 1108, 1995 WL 21565 
at * 5. In addition, Glacier Optical noted that one of the alleged co-conspirators ""actually cut prices significantly soon after its 
meetings with [defendant]."" Id. By contrast, in this action, there is no evidence that price-discounting by CCA and other resellers 
harmed Equifax's image or, more importantly, that ADP or CREDCO reduced prices, either in response to CCA's pricing, or after 
CCA was terminated. In any event, the unpublished opinion in Glacier Optical may not be relied upon here. Finally, National Information Services, Inc., v. TRW Inc., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22497, 1992 WL 715632 (D. Ore. 1992), is 
inapplicable to the Court's analysis of CCA's Cartwright Act claim, because in National Information Services, plaintiffs alleged a 
Section 1 claim based upon an alleged conspiracy to impose non-price restraints, which the court analyzed under a rule of 
reason analysis."
1212,26," In James Jeans, the Ninth Circuit summarized plaintiffs' evidence as consisting of complaints about price cutting coupled with 
the manufacturer's assurance  [*63] that it would 'take care of things,' as well as the termination of a price cutting distributor 
without justification. Unlike the present case, there were no statements by the manufacturer in James Jeans that price cutters 
were ""disrupting the pricing that is in place,"" or proposed agreements on pricing. See J. Briggs Decl., Ex. E (J. Briggs 
Deposition) RT 76:14-77:7. Rather, in James Jeans the evidence that the plaintiffs introduced at trial was consistent only with 
the defendant ""putting pressure on a retailer to adhere to its pricing policy."" James Jeans, 849 F.2d at 1159. "
1213,27," In addition, CCA argues that it is not necessary for a business practice to be unlawful in order for it to be actionable under § 
17200. Opp. at 13, citing Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Fisher Development, Inc., 208 Cal. App. 3d 1433, 1438, 257 
Cal. Rptr. 151 (1989). CCA contends that summary judgment cannot be granted as to the unfair competition claim if ""there is a 
triable issue as to whether the conduct alleged violated the spirit of the antitrust laws in general or significantly threatens or 
harms competition."" Opp. at 15, citing Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 187, 83 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999)."
1213,28," The Agreement provides that ""[t]his Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of 
Georgia."" "
1214,29," CCA further argues that the written contract dated April 1, 2000, did not set pricing terms. Opp. at 18. CCA maintains that 
paragraph 1.7 of the contract referred to schedules of prices ""now or subsequently established by Equifax."" See J. Briggs Decl., 
 [*67] Ex. J. CCA asserts that it insisted pricing be established at the time of contract, and in accordance with CCA's demand, 
pricing was confirmed by Equifax on March 22, 2000, a week before the contract was signed. J. Briggs Decl., Ex. K (e-mail from 
Kathy Weismann of Equifax to J. Briggs), J. Briggs Decl. Ex. E (Deposition of J. Briggs) 121:5-122:7. CCA contends that it was 
told that the rates it paid were the same as the rates that other resellers selling the same volume of credit reports were paid. 
Opp. at 18. Finally, CCA argues that the integration clause in the April 1, 2000 document cannot restrict the rate schedule 
agreed upon on March 22, 2000, because the rate schedule was referenced in the April 1 document. Opp. at 19. Therefore, 
CCA argues that Equifax breached the terms of its contract with CCA by failing to maintain uniform pricing among the resellers. 
Opp. at 18. "
1215,30," CCA responds that Equifax mischaracterizes its letters, in that CCA was referring to a Sherman Act Section 1 claim, and ""did 
not consider or discuss a claim under Section 2 until information was discovered  [*73] in recent depositions that supported the 
claim."" Reply at 1. Equifax disputes this by stating the 2001 letter claimed that Equifax's conduct was illegal under the essential 
facilities doctrine, which would be relevant only as to a Section 2 claim, thereby demonstrating that CCA considered bringing a 
Section 2 claim against Equifax as early as 2001. Supp. Opp. at 1."
1215,31," In particular, Equifax asserts that CCA's proposed Section 2 Sherman Act claim would necessitate discovery regarding issues 
such as market definition, monopoly power, predatory conduct and specific intent which are not relevant to CCA's existing 
Cartwright Act claim. Therefore, Equifax contends that it will have to notice additional depositions, and conduct discovery 
regarding the market shares maintained by TransUnion and Experian. Opp. to CCA's Mot. at 16. "
1216,32," The court in National Information Services concluded that: High market shares, standing alone, do not prove monopoly power … Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that 
TransUnion or Equifax cannot compete with TRW in regions where TRW holds a ""dominant"" share. National Information Services, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22497, 1992 WL 715632 at *10. CCA replies that the court's conclusion in 
National Information Services is distinguishable, because CCA has offered evidence that lenders in the market at issue in this 
case require end-users to purchase Equifax reports: Reply at 10. National Information Services does not, however, demonstrate 
that an amendment would be futile. The  [*75] Court notes that the market facts existing more than ten years ago may not be 
dispositive in this case."
1216,33," Indeed, CCA's expert, Professor Comanor, relies on the essential facilities doctrine to support CCA's proposed Section 2 
claim. See April 20, 2004  [*78] Comanor Decl. at 8 (""The concept of an essential facility has bearing on antitrust cases "
1217,," whenever market power is enhanced when the facility is withheld … Because CCA and other resellers cannot continue in 
business within these states without access to Equifax credit reports, this access represents an essential facility.""). While courts 
of appeal and district courts have traced the essential facilities doctrine to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. 
Terminal Railroad Ass'n of St. Louis, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 810 (1912)(analyzing a combination of trunkline 
railroads that gained control of terminal facilities in St. Louis), the Supreme Court has never expressly adopted the essential 
facilities doctrine as a theory for Section 2 liability. See, e.g., AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 428, 119 S. Ct. 721, 
142 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1999)(Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (referring to the essential facilities doctrine as ""an 
antitrust doctrine that this Court has never adopted""), see also Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 
611, n.44, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (""[W]e find it unnecessary to consider the possible relevance of the 'essential 
facilities' doctrine.""). "
1222,*," In opposition, plaintiff makes an argument based on Section 17500. The Court is perplexed as to the relevance of this section, 
as it was never alleged in the complaint nor cited by defendant in its motion. The Court disregards this section. "

1312,1," Because this is an appeal of a dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the facts set forth here assume

1312,2," In support of this particular claim, Grays Harbor alleges that the assignment of the contract was ""illegal, void and unenforceable

issue was settled when, after the filing of the complaint, FERC officially approved the assignment. Idaho Power Company,

But neither party seriously addresses these arguments on appeal. "
1314,5," Field and conflict preemption stand in contrast to express preemption. See Gadda v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 861, 869-71 (9th Cir. 
2004). Express preemption is not at issue in this appeal."
1314,6," The relevant provision allows FERC to establish a ""refund effective date"" when adjusting rates in order to make them just and 
reasonable. 16 U.S.C. § 824e(b). This date ""shall not be earlier than the date 60 days after the filing of [the] complaint nor later 
than 5 months after the expiration of such 60-day period."" Id. ""At the conclusion of any proceeding under this section, the 
Commission may order the public utility to make refunds of any amounts paid, for the period subsequent to the refund effective 
date. . ., in excess of those which would have been paid under the just and reasonable rate . . . ."" Id. (emphasis added)."
1314,7," Grays Harbor also argues that there is a presumption against preemption. ""We apply a presumption against federal preemption 
unless the state attempts to regulate an area in which there is a history of significant federal regulation."" Gadda, 363 F.3d at 869. 
This presumption is almost certainly not applicable here because the federal government has long regulated wholesale "
1315,," electricity rates. See Fed. Power Comm'n v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 376 U.S. 205, 213, 11 L. Ed. 2d 638, 84 S. Ct. 644 (1964) 
(discussing the development of the Federal Power Act of 1935)."
1315,8," Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. arose under the Natural Gas Act. But because the FPA and the Natural Gas Act are ""substantially 
identical,"" there is an ""established practice of citing interchangeably decisions interpreting the pertinent sections of the two 
statutes."" Ark. La. Gas Co., 453 U.S. at 577 n.7. "
1316,9," The district court alluded to this practical problem in the oral ruling: ""It sounds to me like FERC's scheme, which is where the 
remedy should lie here, may be some what broken and not very practical in order to get relief . . . under the circumstances that 
the plaintiffs allege in their complaint . . . ."""
1316,10," In fact, FERC has investigated and rejected the possibility of refunds for ""spot market"" bilateral sales in the Pacific Northwest. 
See Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity at Wholesale into Elec. Energy and/or 
Capacity Mkts. in the Pac. N.W., 103 F.E.R.C. P 61,348, 2003 WL 21480253, at *6-11 (June 25, 2003). It appears as though 
Grays Harbor took part in these FERC proceedings and attempted to have the contract at issue in this suit included within the 
definition of the ""spot market"" transactions for which refunds were considered. See Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All 
Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity at Wholesale into Elec. Energy and/or Capacity Mkts. in the Pac. N.W., 
96 F.E.R.C. P 63,044, 2001 WL 1116440, at *9, *38 n.94, *44 (Sept. 24, 2001). FERC rejected refunds because it concluded, 
after weighing a number of factors, that ""the directing of refunds in this proceeding would not result in an equitable resolution of 
the matter."" Puget Sound Energy, 103 F.E.R.C. 61348, 2003 WL 21480253, at *11."
1316,11," In fact, ""when the filed rate doctrine applies to state regulators, it does so as a matter of federal pre-emption through the 
Supremacy Clause."" Entergy La., Inc. v. La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 539 U.S. 39, 47, 156 L. Ed. 2d 34, 123 S. Ct. 2050 (2003). "
1318,12," In supplemental briefing, the appellees argue that seeking such declaratory relief here would represent an improper collateral 
attack on a FERC decision. Under the FPA, a party aggrieved by a FERC order must obtain review of that order by petitioning 
the court of appeals; that party cannot attack the order by way of a new lawsuit in federal court. See 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b); see 
also City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U.S. 320, 335-36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1345, 78 S. Ct. 1209 (1958). The appellees 
premise their argument on the fact that Grays Harbor advanced arguments regarding contract formation before FERC in 
proceedings in which FERC declined to provide refunds. See Puget Sound Energy, 96 F.E.R.C. 63044, 2001 WL 1116440, at 
*9, *38 n.94, *44; Puget Sound Energy, 103 F.E.R.C. 61348, 2003 WL 21480253, at *11. At oral argument, the appellees 
attempted to direct the Court to a portion of the Puget Sound Energy proceedings in which contract formation claims made by 
Grays Harbor were explicitly considered and rejected. But a review of the document cited, paragraph 68 of FERC's order of 
November 10, 2003, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity at Wholesale into Elec. 
Energy and/or Capacity Mkts. in the Pac. N.W., 105 F.E.R.C. P 61,183, 2003 WL 22680031 (Nov. 10, 2003), reveals no such 
finding. A finding such as that quoted by the appellees at oral argument appears in paragraph 68 of FERC's order of November 
10, 2003, in Nevada Power Company v. Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 105 F.E.R.C. P 61,185 (Nov. 10, 2003), but it does not 
appear that Grays Harbor was a party to the Nevada Power Company proceedings. In the absence of a finding by FERC in the Puget Sound Energy proceedings such as it made in the Nevada Power Company 
proceedings, we do not believe that declaratory relief as to contract formation is an impermissible collateral attack on FERC's 
order in the Puget Sound Energy proceedings. A finding that no contract existed between the parties here does not contradict, 
and would not call into question, FERC's conclusion that it could not equitably provide refunds for spot market transactions in the 
Pacific Northwest."
1318,13," Because such a complaint would go solely to issues of contract formation, the so-called Mobile-Sierra standards, which relate 
to post-hoc contract modification by FERC, are not relevant. See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Serv. Corp., 350 U.S. 
332, 100 L. Ed. 373, 76 S. Ct. 373 (1956); Fed. Power Comm'n v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 100 L. Ed. 388, 76 S. 
Ct. 368 (1956); see also Nev. Power Co. v. Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 103 F.E.R.C. P 61,353, 2003 WL 21485862, at *2 
(June 26, 2003). "
1319,1," I note that these allegations conflict with the findings of the administrative law judge whose recommendations were considered 
by FERC in prior proceedings relating to these energy transactions. The judge determined that ""evidence demonstrates that the 
Pacific Northwest market for spot sales of electricity was competitive and functional during the relevant period of time . . . ."" See 
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity at Wholesale Into Electric Energy and/ or 
Capacity Markets in the Pacific Northwest, Including Parties to the Western Systems Power Pool Agreement, 103 F.E.R.C. P 
61,348 (June 25, 2003). Therefore, it would be impossible for a court to take judicial notice of the market's dysfunction as this 
fact is apparently a matter that is disputed. "
1326,*," Honorable Ruggero J. Aldisert, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation. 1007. "
1327,1," The Complaint names as defendants LSL, Seminis Vegetable Seeds, Inc., and LSL Plantscience LLC. At the time of the 
Complaint, Seminis and LSL each owned half of Plantscience; Plantscience was the repository for all of LSL's tomato seed 
assets, including the Restrictive Clause. "
1329,2," The Alcoa court sat as a court of last resort pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 29, which at the time authorized the designation of a court 
of appeal as the final stop in certain antitrust actions. Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 421. "
1330,3," The Court devoted very little attention to whether jurisdiction existed. After concluding that the bare minimums were met, the 
Court quickly turned to a more robust discussion of whether principles of international comity should have prevented the 
exercise of jurisdiction. Id. at 797."
1330,4," Applying Alcoa might also ignore the words ""reasonably foreseeable,"" although we recognize that foreseeability might be a 
concept inherent in any scheme that seeks to impose liability."
1330,5," Other circuits have also treated the FTAIA as the binding test for deter-mining jurisdiction over foreign restraints of trade. For 
example, in United Phosphorous, Ltd. v. Angus Chem. Co., the Seventh Circuit thoroughly analyzed the FTAIA and concluded "
1331,," that ""the legislative history shows that jurisdiction stripping is what Congress had in mind in enacting FTAIA."" 322 F.3d 942, 951 
(7th Cir. 2003) (en banc). The court then applied the FTAIA jurisdictional standards and affirmed the district court's dismissal for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 952-53; see also Turicentro, S.A. v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 303 F.3d 293, 304-05 (3d Cir. 
2002) (affirming dismissal because the FTAIA's test was not satisfied); Den Norske, 241 F.3d at 425-29 (applying the FTAIA to 
determine whether subject matter jurisdiction existed); Caribbean Broad. Sys., Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless PLC, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 
226, 148 F.3d 1080, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (""It does seem clear, however, that we should use the standard set forth in the FTAIA 
to analyze whether conduct related to international trade has had an effect of the nature and magnitude necessary to provide us 
with subject matter jurisdiction."")."
1331,6," Unlike the government, the dissent does not argue that the effects need not be direct, but rather that the directness 
requirement has always been part of the ""effects test."" Thus, the panel agrees on the standard; we merely disagree about its 
source. We say it is the FTAIA, while the dissent says the common law. We all recognize that conduct related to international 
trade is exempt from the Sherman Act unless it has a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic 
commerce. Under either approach, the dispositive question is whether the Restrictive Clause operates to have a direct effect on 
U.S. commerce. We think the allegations in the government's complaint, even if taken to be true on a motion to dismiss, are 
insufficient to establish the effect required under the FTAIA. As currently pleaded, it is sheer speculation as to whether Hazera 
will ever be able to develop its own version of long shelf-life tomatoes suitable for growing in North America during the winter. "
1332,7," The dissent consistently refers to Hazera's seeds as though they actually exist; it fails to appreciate that Hazera has not yet 
developed its own long shelf-life tomato seeds capable of cultivation in North America. See Dissent at 11048 (""First, the 
Complaint squarely alleged causation in fact: but for the restraint, United States consumers would have the important potential of 
better winter tomatoes grown from Hazera seeds.""); id. at 11048 (""Consumers in the United States are the persons injured by 
the Restrictive Clause, as they are the ones deprived of the superior tomatoes that competition from Hazera could bring.""); id. at 
11050 ("". . . ignoring the effect of that conduct, which is to deprive the United States consumers of winter tomatoes from Hazera 
seeds.""). We do not read the allegations of PP 38-39 of the government's Complaint as generously as our colleague in dissent. 
See Dissent at 11049-50 n.6. "
1333,8," In other words, the question of fact is whether, accepting the allegations of the Complaint as true, there is a ""direct, substantial, 
and reason-ably foreseeable effect,"" while the question of law is whether the FTAIA provides a basis for jurisdiction. The legal 
question here is relatively straightforward; because the district court's finding of no direct effect survives clearly erroneous 
appellate review, affirmance of its jurisdictional finding necessarily follows. "
1334,1," The district court also entered judgment against the United States for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. 
Rule 12(b)(6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the majority affirms the dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) it does not meet 
this issue. In light of the view I take, it will be necessary for me to discuss this question, infra."
1334,2," See, e.g., Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 789 n.23, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612, 113 S. Ct. 2891 (""Also unclear is 
whether the Act's 'direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect' standard amends existing law or merely codifies it . . . . 
We need not address these questions here."") (citation omitted); see also Dee-K Enters. v. Heveafil Sdn. Bhd, 299 F.3d 281, 287 
(4th Cir. 2002); Kruman v. Christie's Int'l P.L.C., 284 F.3d 384, 399 n.5 (2d Cir. 2002); Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap As v. 
HeereMac Vof, 241 F.3d 420, 428 (5th Cir. 2001). "
1335,3," The opposite situation is presented here. The contested issue is subject matter jurisdiction, not comity. ""The general 
understanding [is] that the Sherman Act covers foreign conduct producing a substantial intended effect in the United States, and 
that concerns of comity come into play, if at all, only after a court has determined that the acts complained of are subject to 
Sherman Act jurisdiction."" Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 797 n.24. Thus, the list of factors relating to moderating enforcement 
powers of the United States in the interest of comity set forth in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N.T. and S.A., 549 
F.2d 597, 614 (9th Cir. 1976), do not necessarily speak to the issue before us. Nor do my personal observations set forth in 
Ruggero J. Aldisert, ""Federal Courts and Extraterritorial Antitrust Law: Enlightened Self Interest or Yankee Imperialism?,"" 5 J.L. 
& Com. 415 (1985). "
1339,4," See cases cited in House Report, supra, at 2490. "
1341,5," The majority points out that the Court in Weltover ""reject[ed] the suggestion that ['direct'] contains any unexpressed 
requirement of 'substantiality' or 'foreseeability.' "" 504 U.S. at 618. This simply indicates, however, that ""direct"" requires 
something less than substantial and fore-seeable. Id. Indeed, a ""direct"" effect, or immediate consequence, on domestic 
commerce is the baseline -- the sine qua non -- of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Althoughthe FSIA requires this baseline, the FTAIA 
requires that the immediate consequence be substantial and foreseeable. Here, the government sufficiently averred that the 
adverse effect on the United States' domestic commerce of tomatoes has been an immediate consequence of the Restrictive 
Clause governing tomato seeds, and given Defendants' ""market power,"" this ""direct effect"" has been, as well, ""reasonably 
foreseeable"" and ""substantial."" See discussion infra. "
1343,6," The majority emphasizes that Hazera has not yet developed its own long term shelf-life tomato seeds and suggests that the 
Restrictive Clause cannot have a direct effect on United States commerce because the prospect of Hazera developing such a 
seed without infringing on LSL's patent is speculative. (See Maj. Op. at 11024 n.7). All of this flies in the face of the 
government's declarations in its Complaint that: (1) Hazera is one of the world's leading tomato seed producing companies, (2) 
Hazera sells more seeds than any other company in many important tomato producing countries, including Spain, Italy, Israel 
and Turkey, (3) For the European and Mediterranean regions, Hazera has bred long shelf-life tomatoes by traditional plant-
breeding processes that do not incorporate the RIN gene (and accordingly do not implicate LSL's patent rights), (4) Hazera is 
one of the few firms with experience and know-how to develop seeds that will allow farmers from the United States and Mexico 
to grow better fresh-market tomatoes for United States consumers during winter months, (E.R. at 11-12, PP 37, 39), and but for 
the Restrictive Clause, Hazera would be a significant competitor to Appellees in North America. Indeed, LSL would have had 
little reason to impose the Restrictive Clause on Hazera if it believed that Hazera's prospect in developing its own long term 
shelf-life tomato seed was ""speculative at best,"" as the majority suggests. Hazera cannot be faulted for not producing seeds in 
Mexico or the United States, as it has done elsewhere, because the Restrictive Clause prohibits it from doing so. "
1344,7," The majority argues that an agreement with farmers in Mexico to set a floor on prices of tomatoes shipped from Mexico to the 
United States supports its position. Suspension of Antidumping Investigation: Fresh Tomatoes From Mexico, 67 Fed. Reg. 
77044-02 (Dec. 16, 2002). The agreement covers all ""fresh or chilled tomatoes (fresh tomatoes) which have Mexico as their 
origin . . . ."" Id. at 77046. The agreement fixes mini-mum prices that tomato growers in Mexico must charge for their product. Id. 
at 77045-77050. The majority argues that this agreement, and the concerns that gave rise to it, belie the United States' 
argument that LSL could raise the prices ultimately paid by American tomato consumers. I disagree, and endorse completely the 
United States' reply to this argument: First, as the United States argued in its briefs, the primary effect of the Restrictive Clause on U.S. commerce is to limit 
innovation that improves tomato quality. The Restrictive Clause excludes Hazera's current and future long shelf-life seeds 
from North America and thereby ensures that no tomatoes grown from those seeds can reach U.S. grocery stores. The 
official anti-dumping agreement cited by LSL has nothing to do with this effect. Second, the very existence of the anti-dumping agreements confirms that the importation of fresh tomatoes from Mexico, 
and the pricing of those tomatoes, have a substantial effect on U.S. domestic commerce. But it is impossible to determine, 
at least at this stage of the proceedings, whether the agreement prevents the Restrictive Clause from affecting prices in the 
United States."

1345,9," Judge Posner has restated this definition in various opinions. In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 123 F.3d 
599, 603 (7th Cir. 1997) (market power or monopoly power is ""the power to raise price above cost without losing so many sales 
as to make the price rise unsustainable"") cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1153, 140 L. Ed. 2d 186, 118 S. Ct. 1178 (1998); Olympia 
Equip. Leasing Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 797 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1986) (market power is ""the power to raise prices

raise prices significantly above the competitive level without losing all of one's business"")."
1345,10," This is not to say that I personally agree with this holding, but it nevertheless binds this panel in this judicial circuit. Like the 
United States, I am concerned that it runs counter to teachings of the Supreme Court that long ago held that international 
conduct such as price fixing and territorial allocations among horizontal competitors is per se unreasonable and hence per se 
unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Timken, 341 U.S. at 599, aff'g Timken, 83 F. Supp. 284, 310 (N.D. Ohio. 1949) 
(""In view of settled law and the facts, defendants' contention that the restraints were reasonable must be rejected as untenable. 
The restraints on commerce, here proved by abundant evidence, have been denounced as unreasonable per se.""); see also 
Nippon, 109 F.3d at 7 (""[t]he instant case falls within [the per se illegal] rubric"") and Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 273, at 379 
(1997)."
1345,11," The district court treated the domestic affairs of LSL as the backdrop of facts upon which to assess the 12(b)(6) motion and 
used the foreign affairs as the backdrop for the 12(b)(1) motion. I agree with the majority that this analysis improperly divided a 
course of conduct that is interrelated and comprised of an impetus in a foreign location and an alleged direct effects in a 
domestic one. The entire course of conduct must be analyzed to determine its effects and this can only be done with the rule of 
reason. A division of activities into domestic and foreign categories was improper. "
1346,12," Defendants do not deny that they have market power in the market for ""seeds designed to grow fresh-market tomatoes in 
North America during the winter months,"" or in any part thereof. In particular, they do not deny the Complaint's allegation that 
they control a 70+ share of the relevant market, which must be taken as correct for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes. Rather, they appear 
to deny market power in a market of their own definition, not alleged by the United States -- ""the sale of long-shelf life tomato "
1347,," seeds for open-field cultivation in winter in the United States"" -- a market in which they insist there is no commerce. (LSL Br. at 
15-17)."
1347,13," When a district court rules on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, unlike a 12(b)(6) motion, it may consider affidavits or other extra-
pleading evidence. St. Clair v. City of Chico, 880 F.2d 199, 201 (9th Cir. 1989)."
1347,14," Tanaka v. University of Southern California, 252 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2001), on which the district court relied, differs from this 
case with respect to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's market, and anticompetitive effects allegations. In that case a former 
collegiate soccer player challenged an intercollegiate athletic association rule that discouraged her from an intraconference 
transfer to a single athletic program, but she apparently did not even attempt to allege geographic or product markets on the 
basis of any economic facts. Instead, she based her allegations simply on her own subjective personal preferences: she alleged 
that ""the relevant [geographic] market is Los Angeles because she wanted to be close to her family,"" id. at 1063 (internal 
quotations and brackets omitted), and that the relevant product market was UCLA because of her ""strictly personal preference"" 
that she wanted to play for UCLA's soccer team. Id. These market allegations were obviously defective, and Tanaka ""failed to 
allege that the transfer rule has had significant anticompetitive effects within a relevant market, however defined."" Id. at 1064. "
1348,15," Rather, this case resembles one Justice Holmes described concerning the product and geographic scope of a domestic meat 
packing monopoly in 1905: ""The scheme alleged is so vast that it presents a new problem in pleading . . . . Its size makes the 
violation of the law more conspicuous, and yet the same thing makes it impossible to fasten the principal fact to a certain time 
and place."" Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 395, 49 L. Ed. 518, 25 S. Ct. 276 (1905). Like Justice Holmes, I conclude 
here that the scheme as a whole seems to . . . be within the reach of the law. The constituent elements . . . are enough to give the 
scheme a body and, for all that we can say, to accomplish it. . . . Although the combination alleged embraces restraint and 
monopoly of trade within a single State, its effect upon commerce among the States is not accidental, secondary, remote, 
or merely probable . . . . Id. at 396-397. "
1360,1," The Court concluded that plaintiffs failed to allege adequately that defendants AHA, AMA and Yeshiva University participated in 
the conspiracy. See Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 173-74. "
1361,2," Contrary to the allegations in plaintiffs' brief, defendants ACGME and AAMC have filed answers to the complaint."
1361,3," Interestingly, in an effort to make out long-arm jurisdiction, plaintiffs did attempt to suggest at oral argument on defendants' 
motion to dismiss that the tortious injury (if not the antitrust injury) to plaintiffs was the Match itself but, in view of plaintiffs' 
complaint, the Court rejected the argument. See Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 136. "
1363,4," Nor would such an endeavor by the Court be consistent with the February 11 Opinion and Order. See Jung v. Association of 
American Medical Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (""conspiracy allegations in antitrust cases cannot be compartmentalized and 
considered in isolation 'as if they were separate lawsuits, thereby overlooking the conspiracy claim itself'"") (quoting In re Fine 
Paper Antitrust Litigation, 685 F.2d 810, 822 (3d Cir. 1982))."
1363,5," The Court's dismissal of the AMA in the February 11 Opinion and Order is irrelevant. Plaintiffs argue that ""the Order shows -- 
indeed establishes as the law of this case -- that legal failure of one component of defendants' alleged conspiracy may lead to 
the dismissal of any defendant only involved in that component, but does not lead to the dismissal of the defendants involved in 
the remaining components."" Pls. 'Opp. at 13 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs base this argument on the Court's conclusion that 
the single allegation regarding the FREIDA database, in the absence of any other allegations relating to AMA participation in the 
conspiracy, ""[did] not lend support to an inference that the AMA participated in the alleged conspiracy."" See Jung v. Association 
of American Medical Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 169. The allegations concerning the Match program, by contrast, permeate 
the complaint and, as the Court concluded, serve as a cornerstone of the conspiracy. See id. at 162. "
1365,6," As later explained by the Supreme Court, the statute at issue in Klein was unconstitutional in two respects: First, ""it prescribed 
a rule of decision in a case pending before the courts, and did so in a manner that required the courts to decide a controversy in 
the Government's favor."" Second, the statute infringed the constitutional power of the President to issue pardons. United States 
v. Sioux Nation of Indians, 448 U.S. 371, 404-05, 65 L. Ed. 2d 844, 100 S. Ct. 2716 (1980)."
1365,7," Plaintiffs also argue that interpreting the substantive provision of Section 207 to require the disposition of this lawsuit in 
defendants' favor is unconstitutional. See Pls. Opp. at 30-31. In light of the Court's conclusion that Section 207 by its own terms 
does not direct judgment for defendants, see Section II. B, supra, the Court does not reach this argument."
1365,8," Despite arguments to the contrary, the statute is not merely a confirmation of prior existing law, the titles of Section 207, 
""Confirmation of Antitrust Status of Graduate Medical Resident Matching Programs,"" and of subsection (b)(2), ""Confirmation of 
Antitrust Status,"" and the articulated purpose of subsection (a)(2)(A) notwithstanding. HN20[

1380,9," In a post-trial Memorandum Opinion rejecting Rambus' contention that the failure to give its proffered Kingsdown instruction 
was in error, the Court analyzed Kingsdown generally and compared Rambus' proposed instruction with the instruction that the 
Court had offered to give: The distinction offered in the Court's proffered version of the instruction is analogous to the exception mentioned in 
Kingsdown: ""any such amendment or insertion must comply with all statutes and regulations."" Kingsdown, 863 F.2d at 874. 
That text teaches that the instruction permitted by Kingsdown cannot be based on information obtained by engaging in 
wrongful conduct because that conduct is in violation of the law of fraud …. Even though Rambus is allowed, at some 
general level, to draft claims to cover a competitor's product, it cannot do so when that action would breach a duty it 
incurred as result of being a member of a standard-setting body. The breach of that duty was based on a failure to disclose 
pending patent applications, not on Rambus choice to amend its patents. "
1381,," Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 164 F. Supp. 2d 743, 775 (E.D. Va. 2001). That discussion reflected the fact that, at trial, 
the instruction offered by Rambus pertained to only to the fraud claim. Infineon's monopolization claim had been dismissed 
without prejudice because JMOL had been granted on Rambus' patent infringement claims. See Unpublished Memorandum 
Opinion, Rambus v. Infineon, 3:00CV524, (E.D. Va. July 21, 2004) (Docket No. 813). The monopolization claim is once again 
part of the case and, due to amendments on remand, so is a unfair business practices claim under California law. Rambus, Inc.

1553, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Pursuant to a motion for summary judgment filed by Rambus, the Court, by way of Memorandum 
Opinion entered on July 21, 2004, dismissed Infineon's defenses of invalidity and unenforceability of the patents-in-suit for 
inequitable conduct in the PTO. "
1382,12," Although not cited by the Federal Circuit in Kingsdown, several district courts courts previously had made similar statements. 
See Micro-Acoustics Corp. v. Bose Corp., 493 F. Supp. 356, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (""There is nothing wrong with broadening the 
claims to cover competitive devices about which the applicant … learns after the application is filed, so long as the claims are

before the United States Patent Office in order to insure that the claims which ultimately appear in the issued patent will cover 
the commercial activity of third parties, whose potentially infringing activities are discovered subsequent to the filing of a patent 
application, so long as the claims are supported by the original patent application disclosure.""). "

1996) (Mayer, J. concurring). "
1386,17," Here, all the patents-in-suit claim priority to the '898 application, filed in 1990."
1386,18," In Kingsdown, and indeed in the subsequent Federal Circuit cases, the Federal Circuit did not discuss in any depth how the 
patent-applicant learned of the competing product. HN14[
] In the background of the cases, however, is the notion that the 
patent-applicant's observation of the competing product simply occurred in the market. For instance, in PIN/NIP, Inc., the court 
stated that the inventors filed additional claims after ""PIN/NIP had publicly disclosed"" a new method. 304 F.3d at 1239. Similarly, 
in Kingsdown itself the court recounted that, ""Kingsdown's patent attorney saw a two-piece ostomy appliance manufactured by 
Hollister,"" 863 F.3d at 870, suggesting that the lawyer simply viewed a device that had been released into the market. Suffice it 
to say that, in none of the cases, did the patent holder learn of the later-added inventions through its participation in a standard-
setting organization."
1386,19," Rambus suggests that this means ""all patent statutes and regulations."" That, however, is not what the Federal Circuit said: the 
rule is that the amendment ""must comply with all statutes and regulations."" 863 F.2d at 874 (emphasis added). "
1387,20," Although the Court will deny Rambus' motion in limine, it may well be that the term ""stolen,"" even under Infineon's theory of the 
case, is an inappropriate term to use in describing Rambus' conduct. There are disputes of fact respecting whether proposed 
JEDEC standards were available to non-JEDEC members and whether, and, to what extent, they were to remain confidential. 
Although it is undisputed that minutes of JEDEC meetings were available to non-JEDEC members, it is unclear what these 
minutes consisted of. According to Infineon, proposed standards offered at JEDEC were supposed to remain confidential. 
Regardless, even under Infineon's theory of the case, Rambus did not come into possession of the information wrongly. Rather, 
as a member of JEDEC, it was entitled to know of the proposed standards; thus, it is difficult to understand how Rambus can be 
said to have ""stolen"" the information. In other words, although Infineon uses the term ""stolen"" in describing Rambus' actions, the 
import of Infineon's allegations is more that Rambus misappropriated the information learned at JEDEC, using it to guide its 
patent prosecution in order to effectuate a monopoly and in a way that constituted an unfair business practice. This issue will 
need to be sorted out after the factual record is developed at trial."
1387,21," Infineon further argues that its equitable defense of prosecution laches allows it to introduce evidence and argument on 
Rambus' use of information gleaned at JEDEC in the prosecution of the patents-in-suit. Infineon contends that, notwithstanding 
Kingsdown, amending a patent application to cover a competitor's product can be pertinent under the doctrine of prosecution 
laches. See Webster Elec. v. Splitdorf Elec. Co., 264 U.S. 463, 68 L. Ed. 792, 44 S. Ct. 342, 1924 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 520 (1924); 
Woodbridge v. United States, 263 U.S. 50, 68 L. Ed. 159, 44 S. Ct. 45, 59 Ct. Cl. 952, 1924 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 534 (1923); 
Chiron Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 268 F. Supp. 2d 1139 (E.D. Cal. 2002). Specifically, referencing its prosecution laches defense, 
Infineon contends that Rambus deliberately stood by while the DRAM industry grew up around the JEDEC standards and, as a 
component of this effort, amended its claims in order to capture the JEDEC standard. There is evidence to support that theory 
and, interestingly, in response, Rambus does not really argue that Infineon's proposed use of the JEDEC evidence is not 
probative of its prosecution laches defense. Rather, Rambus challenges the merits of Infineon's prosecution laches defense. 
Stated otherwise, in responding to Infineon's argument on this score, Rambus more-or-less raises a summary judgment 
challenge to Infineon's ability to proceed on the defense of prosecution laches. This, of course, is improper. Summary judgment 
motions have already been filed, briefed, argued, and ruled on. It is simply too late for Rambus to move, especially in stealth 
form, for summary judgment on Infineon's prosecution laches defense. "
1388,22," Further, Infineon's non-patent law based counterclaims aside, as a matter of the patent-law regime surveyed above, Rambus' 
motion in limine is misplaced. For instance, under 35 U.S.C. § 112, the patent specification must ""convey with reasonable clarity 
to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date [the patent holder] was in possession of the invention."" Vas-Cath Inc. v. 
Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Here, Infineon asserts (and there is evidence to show) that, as of the filing of 
the '898 application, Rambus was not in possession of the inventions claimed by the patents-in-suit. Rather, according to 
Infineon, Rambus only thought to expand its patents to cover those technologies after it learned about them at JEDEC. And, 
under Federal Circuit decisional law, the evidence that Rambus is here seeking to preclude is probative to the 35 U.S.C. § 112 
inquiry. Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp., 134 F.3d 1473, 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (""Finally, although not dispositive, because 
one can add claims to a pending application directed to adequately described subject matter, Sproule admitted at trial that he did 
not consider placing the controls outside the console until he became aware that some of Gentry's competitors were so locating 
the recliner controls. Accordingly, when viewed in its entirety, the disclosure is limited to sofas in which the recliner control is 
located on the console.""). In other words, as a part of its 35 U.S.C. § 112 defense, Infineon, in its attempt to show that Rambus 
was not in possession of the disputed inventions at the time it filed the '898 application, can offer evidence and argument that, 
far from disclosing the invention in the '898 application, Rambus in fact only learned of the inventions from its attendance at 
JEDEC. Thus, as part of its written description defense, Infineon can show that Rambus used information learned at JEDEC to 
guide its patent prosecution in order to cover technologies that it did not actually invent and that were not disclosed in the '898 
application. This fact alone requires denial of Rambus' motion in limine."
1388,23," HN17[
] The offense of monopoly under 15 U.S.C. § 2 has two principal elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-
71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). To the extent that Infineon's Section 17200 claim is based on the California statute's 
""unlawful"" prong, Infineon's Section 17200 claim also turns on these two elements."

profitable to the hypothetical monopolist. Morris Tr. (6/23 afternoon) at 48:24-49:9; Guerin-Calvert Tr. (6/30 afternoon) at 44:24-
45:11. To measure the volume of diverted sales needed to make a particular price increase unprofitable under the hypothetical

customers to be the measurement used to determine a mine's ability to supply them with coal. PX 8601 p 8 (Bales W.D.). It 
refers to the capacity available given the current physical equipment at the mines and the expected overburdens in mine plans. 
PX 8611 at 15. Loadout capacity refers to the capacity while the FTC argues that the court should look to other factors as well, 
and to loadout capacity in particular, to measure concentration. To process coal that has been removed from the pit, crush it, 
accumulate it for shipment, and load it onto trains. PX 8611 at 15. Current production (whether by mine or by mine operator) 
may not be a stable predictor of future competitiveness, or a producer's ability to deliver in the future in the form of sales or 
contracts. Guerin-Calvert Tr. (6/30 afternoon) at 88: 7-21; Lang Tr. (6/24 afternoon) at 62:11-63:19. Producers recognize that 
current production can lead to mistaken perceptions regarding a mine or mine operator's competitive significance. DX 0162. "

1463,12," So, too, do the pre-and post-merger market concentration figures present in those cases far exceed the figures for the SPRB 
market, which barely place the SPRB market in the ""highly concentrated"" market range."
1463,13," In Heinz the court noted that HN18[
] rebuttal evidence may take the form of nonstatistical market evidence raising doubts 
about the persuasive quality of the FTC's statistics or, as was the case in General Dynamics, economic circumstances 
undermining the predictive validity of the government's statistical presentation. See 246 F.3d at 715 n. 7. Here, defendants have 
produced both types of rebuttal evidence -- as in General Dynamics, an alternative statistical assessment based on reserves 
undermines plaintiffs' prima facie case, and in addition a close examination of competition in the relevant market (both presently 
and post-merger) undermines the claim of significant anticompetitive effects. "
1464,14," The FTC has stressed that its challenge here, based on concerns that the major firms in the SPRB may coordinate to restrict 
output, is founded on the premise that output would be less than it would be absent the merger. FTC post-hearing reply brief at 6

Arch anticipates restarting production at Coal Creek before the 2007 deadline. DX 2002. Arch intends to produce enough coal at 
Coal Creek before the end of 2007 to recoup much of its investment. Lang Tr. (6/24 afternoon) at 75:15-76:4, 91:31-92:2; DX

delivered prices, suffering from the same shortcomings as FERC data. Guerin-Calvert Tr. (7/1) at 17:8-19. Information that mine 
operators provide to the railroads for planning purposes concerns short-term shipments and provides no insight into a mine's 
future contracting plans. Guerin-Calvert Tr. (7/1) at 17:20-18:8. The resulting data from the national coal transportation 
association (total tonnage and total trains for the upcoming month) is provided on an aggregated basis -- no mine specific data 
are available to customers or producers. Lapplander Tr. (7/7 morning) at 10:20-12:1. "

injunctive relief to block the proposed acquisition of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. by Waste Management, Inc.) at P9. Waste 
Management, Inc. is the nation's largest waste hauling company, providing waste collection and disposal services throughout 
the United States. Id. In 2002, Waste Management, Inc. reported total revenues of approximately $ 11.1 billion. Id. Waste 
Management, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries. See 2003 Waste Management, 
Inc. Annual Report at 32 (financial information at 1). Waste Management-Washington is one of those subsidiaries organized in 
1999 under the laws of the State of Delaware. It is a matter of public record that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has filed four complaints during the period 
February 15, 1996 to October 14, 2003 in federal district courts alleging that Waste Management-Washington's parent and 
affiliated corporations in other states have engaged in actions that violated federal antitrust law, including monopolization in 
violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. In three of these actions, State Attorneys General also were plaintiffs. See  United

1521,3," On December 14, 1999, Washington Waste Hauling & Recycling, Inc. of Kirkland, Washington was issued a certificate of

No. G-140 from Waste Management of Seattle, Inc., d/b/a Waste Management of Ellensburg/Waste Management of 
Kennewick."" See AR at 408, 489. This appears to be the predecessor certificate of convenience and necessity issued to Waste Management-Washington, which 
also appears as well to apply to a number of other Waste Management-Washington related companies d/b/a: Washington Waste 
Hauling & Recycling Inc.; Recycle America; Rural Skagit Sanitation; Federal Way Disposal; Nick Raffo Garbage; R.S.T.

1522,4," Blue Dot was required to protest Solicitation 45613-03-Q-A028 within 10 days after the basis of the protest was known or 
should have been known, i.e., the date of the pre-solicitation notice issued on September 22, 2003. See AR at 848; see also 4 
C.F.R. § 21.2 (a)(2) (2004). "
1523,5," All of these documents were filed under seal. The court has determined that none of the information and legal analysis therein 
requires confidential treatment other than certain information on pages 5 (lines 2 and 5) and 9 (lines 10 and 12) of the 
Government's May 3, 2004 motion to dismiss. "
1526,6," Solicitation F45613-03-Q-A028 stated that the contract would be awarded as a ""competitive best value acquisition in which 
competing offeror's past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or 
price consideration."" AR at 735. Although Blue Dot received a ""marginal"" overall performance rating for the period December 1, 
2001-March 2002, almost all of the negative comments concerned the recycling center. See AR at 213-16, 218, 235 (""Although 
the refuse collection (subcontracted to Waste Management) is acceptable, their [Blue Dot's] overall performance rating is 
marginal.""). On January 9, 2002, Blue Dot received a ""cure notice."" See AR at 219-21. The Integrated Assessment Best Value 
Decision for F45613-02-Q-A027 indicates that ""[Blue Dot's] Improvement to the recycling center operation did not occur until 7 
months into the contract performance, when a new management team assumed control."" AR at 235. In addition, the Contracting 
Officer notes that Blue Dot received a satisfactory rating for refuse removal at McConnell AFB in Kansas and a very good rating 
for refuse removal from the Veterans Medical and Regional Office in Kansas. See AR at 235. The Contracting Officer, however, 
appears completely to have disregarded these favorable ratings, as well as Blue Dot's efforts to cure prior problems, in 
evaluating Blue Dot's performance history. Id. Waste Management-Washington also argues that Blue Dot cannot satisfy the ""responsible prospective contractor"" requirements 
of the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 U.S.C. § 2305(b)(3), (4) and 48 C.F.R. § 9.103(a), (b), because Blue Dot does not have 
sufficient financial resources to perform the contract, evidenced by its apparent failure to satisfy a $ 261,326.32 judgment owed 
to Waste Management-Washington for subcontracting work. See Def.-Intervenor's Supp. at 4-5. The court is unable to discern 
from the record or briefs filed to date whether that judgment is final or subject to appeal or whether it concerned any of the "
1527,," services that were the primary focus of the Air Force's ""marginal"" performance rating regarding Blue Dot. The court notes that in 
evaluating Blue Dot's August 2, 2002 bid on F45613-02-Q-A027, however, the Contracting Officer did not indicate any concern 
about Blue Dot's financial ability to perform the contract. See AR at 234-35. "

why so few certificates have been issued and why entry applications generally result in hotly-contested hearings."") (emphasis 
added)."
1528,8," The Air Force admits: ""The bulk container price per ton reflects a significant increase for the current contract between 2002 and 
2003[, i.e., []%]. A price fair and reasonable determination was accomplished on 27 January 2003 that identifies the cause for

1542,1," GFI has not challenged Natsource's complaint on the grounds that Natsource has not sufficiently pleaded that GFI had a 
specific intent to monopolize. "
1543,2," Other cases cited by GFI are similarly unavailing. In Adjusters Replace-A-Car, Inc. v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., 735 F.2d 884 
(5th Cir. 1984), a case in which the court affirmed judgment as a matter of law, the court stated that a valid antitrust claim can be 
predicated ""on the basis of evidence that the defendant had induced the plaintiff's employee to act disloyally . . ."" Id. at 884 
(emphasis added). However, the court found that plaintiff's former employee did not act disloyally under the specific facts of this 
case. Id. In Abcor Corp. v. AM Int'l, Inc., 916 F.2d 924 (4th Cir. 1990), the court considered the appeal of a grant of summary judgment 
dismissing an antitrust case predicated in part on the defendant's hiring of two of plaintiff's employees. Id. at 930. The court 
affirmed, finding, based on the unique facts of that case, that nothing suspicious taint[ed] the hiring of the two employees."" Id. 
Thus in Abcor, after being allowed to conduct discovery, plaintiff failed to marshal evidence in support of its claim. Nothing in this 
case supports the proposition that Natsource's claims now should be dismissed as a matter of law. "
1546,3," Although the Merger Guidelines do not carry the force of law, the courts note that they are helpful in providing an analytical 
framework for evaluating antitrust cases. See New York v. Kraft General Foods, Inc. 926 F. Supp. 321, 359 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) 
(relying on the Merger Guidelines to determine the relevant product market); see also Waste Mgmt., Inc. 743 F.2d at 982 (using

1569,6," Because we do not rely on the affidavits of venue managers submitted by Clear Channel, JamSports' Motion to Strike Portions 
of Venue Affidavits is dismissed as moot."
1569,7," JamSports voluntarily dismissed Count 16. See JamSports' Consolidated Discovery Mot. (docket # 73) at n.15 (""JamSports has 
advised Clear Channel that it will not proceed with its alternative product market allegation of specialized motor sports.""). "
1572,8," Although the Court has determined JamSports cannot proceed under the essential facilities doctrine. Clear Channel's alleged 
methods of preventing venues from hosting JamSports events are relevant to Count 15. "
1573,9," If it wishes to seek an order excluding the other matters at trial, Clear Channel should file a motion in limine in connection with 
preparation of the final pretrial order. "
1576,10," Any attempt by the defendants to renew this issue following discovery on damages will have to come by way of a motion in 
limine to preclude evidence regarding lost profits, as the deadline for filing summary judgment motions has passed. "
1577,11," It is unclear whether success on a promissory estoppel theory would limit JamSports to recovery of the expenses it incurred in 
reliance on the alleged promise or whether JamSports would be able to seek lost profits. See, e.g., Gerson Electric Constr. Co. 
v. Honeywell, Inc., 117 Ill. App. 3d 309, 312, 453 N.E.2d 726, 728, 72 Ill. Dec. 851 (1983); see also Goldstick v. ICM Realty, 788 
F.2d 456, 463-64 (7th Cir. 1986). "
1587,1," Defendants cite two federal cases for the proposition that the Sherman Act creates federal removal jurisdiction in this case. See 
General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co., 260 U.S. 261, 67 L. Ed. 244, 43 S. Ct. 106, 1 Ohio Law Abs. 162 (1922); Miller v. 
Granados, 529 F.2d 393 (5th Cir. 1976). Those cases are inapposite. The plaintiffs in both of those cases alleged violations of 
the Sherman Act. Therefore, federal claims arose on the face of the plaintiffs' complaints. General Inv. Co., 260 U.S. at 270-71; 
Miller, 529 F.2d at 394-95. Unlike the plaintiffs in Lake Shore and Miller, MGB has not alleged any violations of the Sherman Act. 
Defendants also cite two Louisiana case to support their argument that the Sherman Act provides a basis for removal 
jurisdiction. See Loew's Inc. v. Don George, Inc., 237 LA. 132, 110 So. 2d 553 (La. 1959); Burgess v. Hogan, 175 So.2d 924 
(La. App. Ct. 1965). Neither of those cases dealt with removal jurisdiction. Instead, they addressed the state courts' inability to 
resolve Sherman Act claims because the Sherman Act gives federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over Sherman Act claims. 
Loew's, 110 So.2d at 137-38; Burgess, 175 So.2d at 925. A state court's lack of jurisdiction over certain claims does not create a "
1588,," basis for federal removal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have clearly established the standard for asserting 
removal jurisdiction. "
1590,2," Defendants cite several cases for the proposition that the court can entertain their counterclaims if there is an independent 
basis of jurisdiction to support them. See Pioche Mines Consol, Inc. v. Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co., 206 F.2d 336 (9th Cir. 
1953); Isenberg v. Biddle, 75 U.S. App. D.C. 100, 125 F.2d 741 (D.C. Cir. 1941); Lion Mfg. Corp. v. Chi. Flexible Shaft Co., 106 
F.2d 930 (7th Cir. 1939); Jackson v. Simmons, 98 F. 768 (7th Cir. 1900). Defendants' cases are inapposite because none is in 
the removal context. All of those cases addressed the situation in which the courts dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for lack of 
jurisdiction, but retained the defendants' counterclaims when an independent basis for federal jurisdiction supported them. None 
of the actions was removed from state court. "
1595,1," Plaintiff's motion to remand was filed on June 25, 2003. Plaintiff's motion for voluntary non-suit was filed on October 16, 2003. 
Plaintiff also filed two motions to amend its complaint on June 25, 2003 and July 3, 2003. Microsoft consented to, and the 
Arkansas District Court granted, the July 3rd motion to the extent it sought to add an additional named representative, however, 
the court declined to rule on any substantive changes. I need not reach these motions as I am granting plaintiffs motion for 
voluntary non-suit. However, I do note that, with the exception of the amendment noted above, it is plaintiff's original complaint 
that I have considered in connection with the motion to remand, because, as indicated below, the propriety of removal is 
determined at the time of removal, which, in this case, was June 18, 2003. See Nolan v. Boeing Co., 919 F.2d 1058, 1064 n.5 
(5th Cir. 1990)."
1595,2," Microsoft's motion to dismiss was filed on June 25, 2003. "
1596,3," Microsoft contends plaintiff's claims would be more appropriately brought under the Arkansas Antitrust Law of 1905 (codified 
at Ark. Code §§ 4-75-301 to 4-75-320) or the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act (codified at Ark. Code §§ 4-75-201 to 4-75-217) 
because these are the Arkansas laws governing alleged antitrust violations. Moreover, plaintiff's claims of price-fixing under the 
ADTPA must fail, Microsoft argues, because price-fixing requires action in concert with another party. See Black's Law 
Dictionary (5th ed. 1979). Of course, claims under the Arkansas antitrust laws would similarly fail, according to Microsoft, 
because the Arkansas Attorney General allegedly has the sole authority under both acts to sue on behalf of indirect purchasers."
1596,4," Of course, another reason that plaintiff's claim cannot be recast as a federal claim is that I have held that the Illinois Brick rule 
prevents persons situated like plaintiff from asserting a claim for monetary damages under federal law. See In re Microsoft Corp. 
Antitrust Litig., 127 F. Supp.2d 702, 708-09 (D. Md. 2001). "
1597,5," A motion to dismiss may be converted into a motion for summary judgment when matters outside the pleading are presented to

1603,1," ICANN does not claim to have any power to regulate ccTLDs. Id. P 78. Nonetheless, 11 of the approximately 240 ccTLDs have 
entered into registry agreements with ICANN. Id. P 81. ""ccTLDs"" compete with other TLD registries. Id. P 19."
1603,2," Over Plaintiff's objection, the Court takes judicial notice of Exhibit L, ICANN's bylaws. The bylaws are a proper subject of 
judicial notice because VeriSign references them in the FAC (e.g., PP 17, 86, 95, 102) and their authenticity is not disputed. 
Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994). "
1604,3," In particular, the services to which VeriSign refers are Site Finder (described at PP 32-33 of the FAC), Wait Listing Service PP 
39-40), ConsoliDate (PP 47-49), Internationalized Domain Names (PP 55-57), and the Incentive Marketing Program (P65). "
1605,4," The parties both treat this case under the ""rule of reason"" standard rather than the ""per se"" rule reserved for presumptively 
illegal practices such as price-fixing, and the Court does the same. See McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 n.3 
(9th Cir. 1988). "
1606,5," ICANN's President, rather than the Board, sent VeriSign a letter requiring it to close its Site Finder Service (""SFS""). FAC P 36. 
The Court takes judicial notice of this October 3, 2003 letter, which VeriSign refers to as the ""Suspension Ultimatum."" Def.'s Req. 
for Judicial Notice, Exh. F. The letter is a proper subject of judicial notice because it is referenced in the FAC and its authenticity 
is not disputed. Branch, supra. Since the Board never took action regarding SFS, the allegation that one of the SFS ""co-
conspirators"" held a seat on the Board is irrelevant. Id. P 138."
1606,6," According to these Bylaws, each of the three Supporting Organizations selects three Directors. Exh. L, Art. 5, § 4. "
1608,7," VeriSign also asserts that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (the Declaratory Judgment 
Act). FAC P 7. HN8[

and ""is not an independent basis of federal question jurisdiction."" See Schwarzer, Tashima & Wagstaffe, Cal. Prac. Guide: Fed.

1609,28," , 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841 (1983). The test is whether the underlying claim that the defendant has threatened to 
pursue in litigation and that plaintiff seeks to avoid through a declaratory judgment arises under federal law. Id. Here, it does not. 
VeriSign merely seeks the Court's interpretation of certain key provisions of the parties' 2001 registry agreement, presumably to 
avoid a breach of contract claim from ICANN."

1623,1," Linerboard includes any grade of paperboard suitable for use in the production of corrugated sheets, which are in turn used in 
the manufacture of corrugated boxes and for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Corrugated sheets are made by

corrugated sheets are also referred to as containerboard. The defendants named in the instant lawsuits are major integrated

1623,2," The FTC charged Stone with a unilateral violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. According to the FTC, 
Stone had attempted to reduce linerboard inventories and had ""invited"" some of its competitors to join in a ""coordinated price 
increase."" The FTC did not allege that any other manufacturer had accepted Stone's ""invitation,"" nor did it allege the existence of 
any conspiracy. Stone and the FTC entered into a consent decree. In doing so, Sone did not admit liability for its alleged 
unilateral misconduct, and the consent decree has no preclusive effect on Stone in this private party action. See In re Linerboard

1624,5," By Order dated August 26, 2003, this Court approved a partial settlement in the amount of $ 8 million between plaintiff classes 
and Temple-Inland, Inc. and Gaylord Container Corp. The $ 8 million settlement was reduced to$ 7.2 million in accordance with 
the terms of the settlement agreement based on the number of parties that subsequently opted-out of the classes. This first 
partial settlement was described by petitioners as an ""ice-breaker-a settlement that would lead to further settlements. Within a month of Court approval of the ice-breaker settlement, on September 22, 2003, the plaintiff classes and defendants 
International Paper Company and Union Camp Corporation, Georgia Pacific Corporation, and Weyerhauser Company 
announced they had reached a settlement in the total amount of $ 68 million. The Court granted final approval of that settlement 
on December 8, 2003. Prior to that date, in October and November 2003, the parties announced the two additional partial settlements with defendants 
Packaging Corporation of America, Tenneco, Inc., and Tenneco Packaging, Inc. (The ""PCA settlement"") in the amount of $ 43 
million and with defendants Stone Container Corporation, Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, and Smurfit Stone Container 
Corporation (the ""Stone settlement"") in the amount of $ 92.5 million. As a result of a ""most favored nation's clause"" in the PCA 
settlement agreement, the terms of the Stone settlement triggered a reduction in the PCA settlement from $ 43 million to $ 34 
million. The Court granted final approval of both the PCA settlement and the Stone settlement by Memorandum and Order dated

1632,8," The states have adopted various standards for assessing the requisite contacts between a claimant and a state's economy in 
order to give rise to a claim under the state's antitrust laws. Many, but not all, have adopted what amounts to an effects-based 
standard. See, e.g., Abbott Lab. v. Durrett, 746 So. 2d 316, 1998 Ala. LEXIS 208, 1998 WL 436062 (Ala. July 31, 1998) (limiting 
field of operation to purely intrastate transactions); Heath Consultants, Inc. v. Precision Instruments, Inc., 247 Neb. 267, 527 
N.W.2d 596, 606-07 (Neb.1995); C. Bennett Bldg. Supplies Inc. v. Jenn Air Corp., 759 S.W.2d 883, 889 (Mo.Ct.App.1988); 
International Television Prods. Ltd. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Television Div., 622 F. Supp. 1532, 1540 (S.D.N.Y.1985); Lynch 
Display Corp. v. National Souvenir Ctr. Inc., 640 S.W.2d 837, 840 (Tenn.Ct.App.1982) (examining whether intrastate effects of 
alleged conduct predominate over interstate effects to determine applicability of state antitrust statute); R.E. Spriggs Co. v. 
Adolph Coors Co., 37 Cal. App. 3d 653, 112 Cal.Rptr. 585, 593 (Cal.Ct.App.1974) (relying on ""factual nexus"" within state to

which ""extends the jurisdictional scope of [state] antitrust law to unlawful activity which has significantly and adversely affected 
trade and economic competition within this state""). "
1634,9," Defendants argue that the Supreme Court of Colorado would not adopt cross-jurisdictional class action tolling because 
Colorado courts strictly construe statutes of limitations and do not allow for tolling absent a specific statutory provision to that 
effect. Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 18. However, as the citation to Rosenthal makes clear, Colorado has adopted intrajurisdictional 
class action tolling."
1634,10," Defendants argue that the Supreme Court of Kansas would not adopt cross-jurisdictional class action tolling because Kansas 
courts strictly construe statutes of limitations. Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 19. Defendants further argue that issues related to Kansas 
state statutes of limitations must be resolved solely with reference to Kansas law. Id. However, as the citation to Waltrip makes 
clear, Kansas has adopted intra-jurisdictional class action tolling. "
1639,11," In Three J Farms, the Court ruled: Therefore any claim for damages resulting from the importation or the sale of imported corrugated containers is not a South 
Carolina claim, but purely a federal claim. This would include the plaintiff Shapiro since he was not located in South 
Carolina and in his affidavit affirms: 'It is conceded, of course, that corrugated boxes involved in this complaint have been 
shipped by the defendants into South Carolina.'"
1639,1978," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14134, 1978 WL 1459 at *6. Similarly in In re Wiring Device, the district court concluded: The sole connection between the defendants and South Carolina is that an insignificant portion approximately one percent 
of the wiring devices which they have manufactured outside the state has been imported into the state. Thus, each 
defendant's activities in South Carolina involve nothing more than ""soliciting, cultivating and supervising its interstate 
business."" This circumstance is not sufficient to invoke the application of section 39-3-10. The well-established South 
Carolina rule that wholly interstate activity is outside the scope of that section must be applied."
1639,498, F. Supp. at 83. 
1640,12," In place of ""rote reliance"" on the intrastate/interstate distinction, the Emergency One court adopted an ""adverse effects 
standard"" to determine whether Wisconsin state antitrust statutes are appropriately applied to economic activity that is both 
intrastate and interstate in character. The court reasoned: An adverse effects standard would extend the jurisdictional scope of Wisconsin antitrust law to unlawful activity which has 
significantly and adversely affected trade and economic competition within this state. This standard is consistent with both 
Wisconsin precedent and judicial interpretations of the scope of federal antitrust law. Most importantly, it comports with the 
legislative intent of Chapter 133 . . . In a recent decision addressing the correct burden of proof to be applied to private, civil 
antitrust actions under the chapter, the Wisconsin Supreme Court noted its assumption that ""the legislature intended an 
interpretation that advances, not hinders, the purposes of the statute."" Ultimately, an adverse effects standard is the only 
standard that remains faithful to the purpose of Chapter 133--to protect and encourage competition in this state, by 
penalizing interstate activities that adversely affect it. Id. at 969-970 (citations omitted). "
1649,1," This case was argued on May 19, 2004, before a panel of this court consisting of Chief Justice Sullivan and Justices Norcott, 
Katz, Vertefeuille and Zarella. Thereafter, the court, pursuant to Practice Book § 70-7 (b), sua sponte, ordered that the case be "
1650,," considered . Justices Borden and Palmer were added to the panel, and they have read the record and the briefs, and have 
listened to the tape recording of the original oral argument."
1650,2," The plaintiff's complaint also contained a breach of contract claim, which was dismissed by the trial court prior to trial. The 
plaintiff has not appealed from that ruling, and, therefore, it is not before us in the present appeal."
1650,3," Section 2-548 of the Hartford municipal code provides in relevant part: HN1[
] ""(a) The contract for which sealed bids are 
invited shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Any person or organization is deemed not to be a responsible bidder 
that . . . "

Act and that such violation continues to exist . . . . ""(c) The city manager shall certify whether the bidder is deemed to be a responsible bidder. If the city manager deems a bidder 
to meet the city's requirements, the bidder will be certified for a period of one (1) year. In each case, where the city manager 
determines that a bidder is not deemed to be a responsible bidder, he shall state his reasons in a written opinion to be forwarded 
to . . . the bidder. . . ."""
1651,4, Laidlaw was the only union shop of the three bidders on the contract.
1651,5," At the time of the plaintiff's first appeal to this court, Laidlaw had not been joined as a defendant, and, therefore, it was not a 
party to that appeal. Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. v. Hartford, supra, 262 Conn. 241. As we noted previously, however, when 
the case was reclaimed to the trial list, Laidlaw subsequently was a defendant in the plaintiff's action. In the current appeal, 
Laidlaw is involved as an appellee only as to the plaintiff's final claim--whether the trial court properly denied the plaintiff's 
request for injunctive relief. In conformity with our prior opinion, therefore, we will continue to refer to the city of Hartford as the 
defendant, and we refer to Laidlaw by name in part IV of this opinion, which addresses the plaintiff's final claim. "
1652,6," The defendant's motion to set aside the verdict also claimed that: (1) there was no evidence submitted upon which a 
reasonable jury could have concluded that the defendant conspired to restrain trade; and (2) there was no evidence upon which 
a reasonable jury could have concluded that the plaintiff suffered damages or an antitrust injury. Because the trial court found 
that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the present case, it declined to address the defendant's claim that there was 
insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant had conspired to restrain trade. Therefore, that claim is not before us 
in the present appeal. The defendant's remaining claim, that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the plaintiff 
had suffered damages for an antitrust injury, is addressed in part II of this opinion."
1652,7," General Statutes § 35-31 provides: HN7[
] ""(a) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to forbid the existence or 
operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations instituted for the purpose of mutual help, and not having capital 
stock and not conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the "
1653,," legitimate objects thereof. Such organizations, or the members thereof, shall not be held or construed to be illegal combinations 
or conspiracies or monopolies in restraint of trade, under the provisions of this chapter. ""(b) Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said activity is specifically directed or 
required by a statute of this state, or of the United States. ""(c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent persons engaged in the production of agricultural products as 
farmers, planters, dairymen or growers from acting together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock,

persons so engaged. Such associations may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members 
may make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes; provided, such associations are operated for the 
mutual benefit of the members thereof, as such producers, and conform to one or both of the following requirements: (i) That no 
member of the association is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he may own 
therein, or, (ii) that the association does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of eight per cent per 
annum, and, (iii) that the association shall not deal in the products of nonmembers to an amount greater in value than such as 
are handled by it for members."""
1653,8," HN8[
] ""In construing [the act] . . . the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."" General Statutes § 35-44b. We note, therefore, that HN9[
] the federal courts, including the United 
States Supreme Court, consistently have held that a municipality is a ""person"" within the federal antitrust statutes. See, e.g., 
Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 396, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978)."
1653,9," Our resolution of this issue is informed further by our decision in Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, 235 
Conn. 1, 26, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). In that case, the defendant, a transit district established by the town of Westport, provided 
bus and taxi services in direct competition with the plaintiff. After the plaintiff was forced out of business, it brought an action 
against the defendant, alleging violations of the act. Id., 11-12. The trial court found that the defendant had engaged in 
attempted monopolization and actual monopolization in violation of the act, and awarded the plaintiff damages for lost profits, the 
value of the business, and prejudgment interest. In addition, the trial court awarded the plaintiff treble damages under § 35-35. 
Id., 12-13. On appeal to this court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that it was entitled to ""governmental immunity applicable to 
municipalities and their agencies because it is a transit district established by the town of Westport."" Id., 26. We declined to 
review this claim, concluding that the record was insufficient to analyze the defendant's claim properly. Id., 27. Accordingly, we 
concluded that the trial court properly awarded the plaintiff treble damages for lost profits and the lost value of the business. Id., 
45. "
1654,10," See, e.g., Blesso Fire Systems, Inc. v. Eastern Connecticut State University, 245 Conn. 252, 254-55, 713 A.2d 1283 (1998); 
Unisys Corp. v. Dept. of Labor, 220 Conn. 689, 693-95, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991); Ardmare Construction Co. v. Freedman, 191

Conn. 338, 349, 122 A.2d 399 (1956). "
1655,11," We note that the defendant's anticompetitive behavior in the present case resulted in a greater cost to taxpayers for the 
contract, not less. Although awarding damages to the plaintiff, the injured party, may exacerbate the additional costs paid by the 
taxpayers, thus bolstering the defendant's policy argument for exempting the municipal bidding process from the act, any change 
to the act must come from the legislature, not this court."
1655,12," With regard to morning, midday and afternoon service, the bid form requested prices for the following specifications: thirty-four 
school buses for morning service, running from 6:30 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.; one school bus for midday service, running from 10:30 
a.m. to 12 p.m.; and thirty-four school buses for afternoon service, running from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. "
1656,13," In denying the defendant's motion to strike Terry's testimony as irrelevant, the trial court stated: ""My difficulty now is in 
[granting] a motion to strike if the trial isn't over, so I can't say that the testimony is not relevant, you know, as such. But I am 
telling you, counsel, in fairness to you, that unless it is tied up, I am going to have a problem, because one of the aspects of this 
case is a request for an injunction, and the other aspect of this case is a request for damages. . . . The law permits speculation, 
but in certain respects on future earnings, and the cases are pretty liberal. Like a claim for future earnings, but there has to be 
some foundational requirement. And [Terry] didn't remember any costs of this contract, she didn't remember maintenance, 
facilities, she had no access to these figures. And yet she says that she relies on these figures in determining what her bid price 
was and what her rate of profit is. . . . I can't say that her testimony was completely irrelevant, but I am telling you, counsel, 
unless there is more offered in the way of facts and figures that [Terry] relied on, I may be in a position where I grant a motion for 
a directed verdict . . . . And in fairness to you, I will allow you to recall her if she has figures."""
1656,14," Approximately 8.5 percent of the net present value of $ 5,862,997.93, the plaintiff's bid on the Hartford school transportation 
contract, amounted to approximately $ 500,000, the amount awarded the plaintiff. Terry's estimated profit of between 8 and 10 
percent of the net present value represents a profit between $ 469,039.83 and $ 586,299.79. Accordingly, the jury's damage 
award falls within this range. "
1658,15," The plaintiff had been charging a fare of $ 1.80 for an average three mile trip, whereas taxi companies in the surrounding 
areas of Bridgeport, Greenwich and Stamford had been charging $ 2.70 for the same distance. The trial court therefore awarded "
1659,," lost profits on the basis of the difference between the $ 1.80 average fare that the plaintiff had been charging and the $ 2.70 
average fare that it could have charged. Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 235 Conn. 30-31."
1659,16," We note, in addition, that our observation in Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 235 Conn. 29, that 
the trial court in that case had ""made meticulous findings of fact and clearly detailed its calculations"" regarding the plaintiff's lost 
profits, does not lessen the applicability of that case to our resolution of this issue in the present case. This detail was the result 
of the fact that Westport Taxi Service, Inc., was tried to the court, which has the ability, and indeed the obligation, to provide 
such findings. See Practice Book § 6-1 (a)."
1659,17," The defendant attempts to distinguish the present case from Capitol City Personnel Services, Inc. v. Franklin, supra, 52 Conn. 
App. 787, because in that case, ""the plaintiff's witness testified that [the] plaintiff had earned a 25 percent profit markup on its 
billings for the same type of business in the same locality over the past three years. [The] plaintiff also presented testimony that 
other businesses in the same industry and area also earned about the same percentage profit at the time."" This is a distinction 
without a difference. In the present case, Terry testified that she always anticipates a profit of between 8 and 10 percent, and 
that she usually is accurate. Therefore, Terry's estimate of lost profits was not a ""pure guess [that] was wholly unsupported as to 
either the amount of business lost or the profit to be expected."" Doeltz v. Longshore, Inc., 126 Conn. 597, 602, 13 A.2d 505 
(1940). Moreover, the fact that the plaintiff had submitted the lowest bid on the Hartford school transportation contract, is 
evidence that the plaintiff's bid was competitive in the industry. Therefore, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Terry's 
stated anticipated profit of 8 to 10 percent was accurate as to the state's school transportation industry, as well as to this 
particular plaintiff. Finally, the fact that the plaintiff's anticipated profit had ranged from 8 to 10 percent is not fatal to its claim for 
lost profits; that range of anticipated profit was sufficiently restrictive to permit the jury to determine the damages with reasonable 
certainty. See Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 235 Conn. 33-34 (trial court's reliance on fair rate of 
return of between 10 to 12 percent in valuing plaintiff's business was proper). Similarly, the dissent's reliance on Doeltz is misplaced. In that case, this court determined that lost profits had been improperly 
awarded for the plaintiff's new business when profits had actually increased after the defendant's interference and the plaintiff 
had presented no evidence of costs other than rent. Doeltz v. Longshore, Inc., supra, 126 Conn. 601. In addition, the plaintiff's "
1660,," testimony that ""we usually figure on the liquor 100 [percent profit] and food 50 [percent profit]""; id., 599; in an attempt to establish 
lost profits was deficient. Id., 601. This court concluded in Doeltz that, without more evidence, simply averaging the two figures 
to arrive at a claim for 75 percent lost profit, was insufficient, because ""no attempt was made to show what relative proportion of 
[the plaintiff's] total sales fell within one class or the other. The evidence quoted shows that the estimate of the plaintiff was a 
pure guess and was wholly unsupported as to either the amount of business lost or the profit to be expected."" Id., 601-602. "
1661,18," In addition, we note that neither Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc., nor Gordon were antitrust cases and, accordingly, both can be 
distinguished on that ground alone. See Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 235 Conn. 28 (there is ""a 
lesser burden of proving the amount of damages in antitrust suits than in other contexts"" [internal quotation marks omitted]); see 
also Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. v. Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin, supra, 247 Conn. 92 (Peters, J., dissenting)."
1661,19," HN20[
] ""The rule precluding double recovery is a simple and time- honored maxim that [a] plaintiff may be compensated 
only once for his just damages for the same injury. . . . Plaintiffs are not foreclosed from suing multiple defendants, either jointly 
or separately, for injuries for which each is liable, nor are they foreclosed from obtaining multiple judgments against joint 
tortfeasors. . . . The possible rendition of multiple judgments does not, however, defeat the proposition that a litigant may recover 
just damages only once. . . . Double recovery is foreclosed by the rule that only one satisfaction may be obtained for a loss that 
is the subject of two or more judgments."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Haynes v. Yale-New Haven Hospital, 243 Conn. 17, 
22 n.6, 699 A.2d 964 (1997)."
1661,20," In its complaint, the plaintiff also sought prohibitory injunctive relief, namely, that the court temporarily restrain the defendant 
from entering into the contract with another party, and temporarily restrain the defendant from permitting any party to perform "
1662,," work under the contract. The plaintiff concedes that, because the contract was in fact almost complete at the time of the hearing, 
its request for prohibitory injunctive relief was moot and nonjusticable. Consequently, we will address only the trial court's denial 
of the plaintiff's request for prospective mandatory relief. See Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. October Twenty-Four, Inc., 230 Conn. 641, 
652, 646 A.2d 133 (1994) (distinguishing prohibitory injunctions from mandatory injunctions)."
1662,21, Laidlaw is involved as an appellee solely for this claim. See footnote 5 of this opinion.
1662,22," Such a remedy also would create an expansive range of practical problems for the trial court when developing, and 
subsequently monitoring, the new contract, including: how would cost be determined; what services would be covered under the 
contract; how would changes resulting from changed market conditions be addressed; and how would the level of service 
provided by the plaintiff be measured. "
1663,1," I join fully in the reasoning and conclusion set forth in part I of the majority opinion. I agree with the outcome in part III of the 
majority opinion, yet I would reach that result based on my conclusion that the plaintiff, Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd., had failed 
to present an adequate record for review. With regard to part IV of the majority opinion, I agree that ""the trial court properly 
exercised its discretion in denying the relief requested."""
1663,2," This court has articulated a number of factors to be taken into account when evaluating whether a plaintiff has proved lost 
profits to a reasonable certainty. Those factors include: a plaintiff's prior experience in the same business; the plaintiff's 
experience in the same enterprise subsequent to the interference; the experience of the plaintiff and that of third parties in a 
similar business when dealing with a new business; the average experience of participants in the same line of business as the 
injured party; and prelitigation projections. Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. v. Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin, supra, 247 Conn. 
72-74. We have emphasized, however, that ""the underlying requirement for each of these types of evidence is a substantial 
similarity between the facts forming the basis of the profit projections and the business opportunity that was destroyed."" Id., 74. "
1664,3," In testifying generally about the bid preparation process, Terry stated: ""You can't determine your price per bus until you have all 
[of your] costs factored in. This is how you come out with your cost per bus or cost per van when you have your driver pay scale 
and all of the above that I just mentioned. And then you come out with the total price. Then you add your profit, which is usually 
between--I usually add 8 to 10 percent, hoping for the higher, but I don't know until after that first year."" (Emphasis added.) With regard to the bid submitted to the defendant, the following colloquy occurred during the plaintiff's direct examination of 
Terry: ""Q. And what was the net present value of the five years in the [bid submitted to the defendant]? ""A. $ 5,862,097. ""Q. And of that, what was your anticipated profit? ""A. It would have been about 8 to 10 percent that I would have hoped for."" "
1665,4," With regard to how she calculated the bid submitted to the defendant, Terry testified: ""I took my costs, as I always do, and 
added a profit, and that is all I can tell you because that is the way you do it."""
1665,5," The majority claims that ""the fact that the plaintiff's anticipated profit had ranged from 8 to 10 percent is not fatal to its claim for 
lost profits; that range of anticipated profit was sufficiently restrictive to permit the jury to determine the damages with reasonable 
certainty."" This statement misses the point. The fact that the plaintiff may have adjusted its anticipated profit between 8 and 10 
percent for varying bids it had made in the past is not relevant. What is relevant to the present case, however, is the profit level 
the plaintiff factored into the specific bid submitted to the defendant. Terry was unable to testify to that amount, and could only 
testify that in the past it had ranged from 8 to 10 percent. Indeed, the fact that Terry testified that it ranged from 8 to 10 percent 
indicates that it was always a firm number, and not a range, that she factored into a particular contract. The record further reveals that the plaintiff had never provided busing services to the defendant before, and its prior contracts 
were with towns in the southeastern portion of Connecticut. The majority concludes that the fact that the plaintiff submitted the 
lowest bid indicates that ""the plaintiff's bid was competitive in the industry."" Although that may be true, it also may be true that 
the fact that the plaintiff submitted the lowest bid is evidence that the plaintiff reduced its normal profit level in order to win this 
contract, and expand its business into the central portion of the state. In sum, the fact that the plaintiff submitted the lowest bid 
has no bearing on a determination as to what the plaintiff's profit would have been if it had been awarded the contract. "
1666,6," Specifically, the trial court stated: ""My difficulty now is in [granting] a motion to strike if the trial isn't over, so I can't say that the 
testimony is not relevant, you know, as such. But I am telling you, counsel, in fairness to you, that unless it is tied up, I am going 
to have a problem, because one of the aspects of this case is a request for an injunction, and the other aspect of this case is a 
request for damages. . . . The law permits speculation, but in certain respects on future earnings, and the cases are pretty 
liberal. Like a claim for future earnings, but there has to be some foundational requirement. And [Terry] didn't remember any 
costs of this contract, she didn't remember maintenance, facilities, she had no access to these figures. And yet she says that she 
relies on these figures in determining what her bid price was and what her rate of profit is. . . . I can't say that her testimony was 
completely irrelevant, but I am telling you, counsel, unless there is more offered in the way of facts and figures that [Terry] relied 
on, I may be in a position where I grant a motion for a directed verdict . . . . And in fairness to you, I will allow you to recall her if 
she has figures."""
1666,7, See footnote 2 of this opinion.
1666,8," Although $ 2500 is slightly less than 75 percent profit of $ 3750 in sales, the plaintiff stated that the lower amount was 
applicable because ""sometimes you give something away free of charge, and so forth, you know, the kids come in for ice cream 
cones and sometimes you give a drink away on the house."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Doeltz v. Longshore, Inc., supra, 
126 Conn. 599. "
1667,9," The majority's reliance on Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 235 Conn. 1, in support of its 
conclusion is misplaced. To begin with, much of the discussion the majority cites to from Westport Taxi Service, Inc., is 
contained in the part of that opinion addressing the defendant's challenge to the trial court's award of $ 150,000 for the loss of 
the business, and not the part of that opinion addressing the defendant's challenge to an award of $ 12,144 in lost profits. See 
id., 32-35. Second, within that part of Westport Taxi Service, Inc., addressing the award for lost profits, this court noted that the 
trial court, as the trier of fact in that case, had ""sufficient evidence"" from which to make ""reasonable assumptions"" concerning 
lost profits. Id., 32. That sufficient evidence included, inter alia, evidence that the plaintiff collected a $ 1.80 average fare, that the 
state commission would have approved a fare increase to the rate of $ 2.70, that surrounding communities were charging an 
average fare of $ 2.70, and that the commission considered a reasonable rate of return to be a ratio of operating costs to gross 
revenue of between 85 and 95 percent. Id., 30-31. That level of evidence simply was not presented by Terry in the present case. 
Thus, while the majority is correct that the owner in Westport Taxi Service, Inc., properly was allowed to testify that a fair rate of 
return on a taxi business would be 10 to 12 percent, the trial court ""applied this rate of return to its own calculations of the 
plaintiff's lost profits and concluded that the plaintiff's value was $ 150,000."" (Emphasis added.) Id., 34. Put another way, the 
award for lost value of business was based on calculations made from the ""sufficient evidence"" of lost profits presented by the 
plaintiff; id., 32; evidence that is completely absent in the present case. "

reversed the granting of the temporary injunction. Following remand, the district court conducted a hearing, reviewed extensive 
discovery taken following the remand, and made extensive findings, which these plaintiffs urge for our consideration. We, 
however, find those findings of scant relevance here. The hearing on a temporary injunction is preliminary, and the one here was 
made irrelevant when we ordered it vacated in the prior decision. HN2[

preliminary and thus do not contribute to any determination of facts in dispute. Econ. Roofing & Insulating Co. v. Zumaris, 538

general's authority to ""restrain and prevent"" antitrust violations, Wash. Rev. Code § 19.86.080. A contrary interpretation (that is,

1712,8," The end payor plaintiffs urge the Court to disregard the Fifth Circuit's determination because Louisiana antitrust law"" was

Co., 493 So. 2d 1149, 1154 (La. 1986)). As the Fifth Circuit noted, however, Louisiana Power addressed a question of statutory 
interpretation ""distinguishable"" from the ""policy laden"" question of defining antitrust injury: ""Louisiana courts have not eschewed 
the importance of defining antitrust injury in this manner but, in fact, have deferred to federal precedent."" Free, 176 F.3d at 300. Moreover, even if the Court were not convinced by Free, it would remain convinced by Loew's: ""In Loew's, Incorporated v. Don 
George, Inc., 237 La. 132, 110 So.2d 553 (La. 1959), the Supreme Court held that an antitrust action sounds in tort and the one 
year prescriptive period of La. C.C. art. 3492 applies in a private action."" State ex rel. Ieyoub v. Bordens, Inc., 684 So.2d 1024, 
1026 (La. Ct. App. 1996). Under Loew's, end payors from Louisiana, unlike end payors from other Group I states, are subject to 
an apparent time bar, a fact that ""'invariably weighs against class certification under Rule 23(b) (3).'"" See Relafen, 221 F.R.D. at 
283 (quoting Waste Management, 208 F.3d at 296)."
1712,9," The Court is not persuaded that end payors claims present a different question because they are ""premised primarily on the 
New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act"" rather than the New Jersey Antitrust Act. Pls.' Supp. Mem. at 5. Like the unjust enrichment 
claims described above, consumer fraud claims may create precisely the risk of ""multiple recoveries,"" which Illinois Brick (and 
parallel New Jersey decisions) seek to avoid. "
1713,10," The value of their statutory damages provisions distinguishes the laws Hawaii and New Mexico from the law of 
Massachusetts, for example. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9 (""If the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the 
amount of actual damages or twenty-five dollars, whichever is greater. . . .""). The Seventh Circuit in Reynolds suggested that 
waiver of such modest amounts may not present a ""fatal"" conflict. See Reynolds, 288 F.3d at 282 (noting that where class 
members would receive $ 15 for one refund anticipation loan and $ 30 for two or more such loans, there was an unremarked 
conflict ""between those class members who took out one or two refund anticipation loans and those who took out more than two 
and thus will receive no compensation for the additional damages,"" but declining to find this conflict fatal ""in light of the modesty 
of the stakes""). "
1721,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are uncontested and distilled from the parties' moving papers."
1721,2," ""Window coverings"" is an inclusive term referring to blinds, shades, and shutters. However, draperies or curtains are not 
considered window coverings. Gottuso Decl., at P 2. For those in the ""House Beautiful"" know, apparently the latter are included 
in the ""window treatment"" category."
1721,3," While alleging that the two fabricators -- Blinds and Designs and Steven Fabrics -- are co-conspirators in the antitrust violation, 
plaintiff oddly fails to name them as defendants in the current lawsuit. As a result, the fabricators are not formally parties to the 
current litigation and are merely mentioned in this order to provide factual context. Hunter Douglas, Inc. is the only defendant in 
the present action."
1721,4," According to the Hunter Douglas Dealer Advertising Policy, examples of false and misleading claims include any ad that 
contains the phrases ""factory direct prices;"" ""factory sale;"" ""factory discount prices;"" ""warehouse prices/discounts;"" ""buy direct "
1722,," and save;"" ""wholesale pricing;"" and any other statement which implies that the retailer is purchasing directly from the 
manufacturer. App. of Exs. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 2 at 6."
1722,5," Concerns with Internet and telephone purchases stem from the fact that Hunter Douglas views these mediums of exchange as 
inherently impersonal and removed. As explained by Richard Gottuso, vice president and general counsel of Hunter Douglas, ""In 
instituting its advertising policies, Hunter Douglas exercised its sound business judgment and determined that sales 
presentations as to [proprietary products] should be made, to the greatest extent possible, in-person, by well-informed dealers, 
so as to ensure superior customer service commensurate with the high expectations of consumers that express interest in 
purchasing such products. Such face-to-face encounters are important, because they facilitate immediate and unfettered 
communication between dealers and consumers."" Gottuso Decl., at P 12."
1722,6," In support of its decision to terminate business ties, Hunter Douglas specifically cited Blind Doctor's use of a toll -- free 
telephone number which was published on its website that allowed customers to purchase proprietary products; Blind Doctor's 
improper use of Hunter Douglas' marks in an Internet domain name; and Blind Doctor's improper publishing of retail price 
information for Hunter Douglas's proprietary products on its website. "
1724,7," Read literally, the statute deems unlawful ""every"" contract that restrains trade. But, as Justice Brandeis noted, restraint is the 
very essence of every contract and, read literally, Section One would outlaw the entire body of private contract law: ""The legality 
of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. Every agreement, 
concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence."" Chicago Bd. of Trade v. 
United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918)."
1724,8," As the Supreme Court has reminded, the purpose of both the per se and rule of reason analyses is ""to form a judgment about 
the competitive significance of the restraint; it is not to decide whether a policy favoring competition is in the public interest, or in 
the interest of the members of an industry."" National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692 (1978). 
That policy decision lies in the exclusive purview of Congress. "
1725,9," Even if defendant had taken the more drastic step of dictating prices to retailers, defendant would still not be found in violation 
of Section One so long as it acted unilaterally. See Mularkey v. Holsum Bakery, Inc., 146 F.3d 1064, 1065 (9th Cir. 1998). Yet 
plaintiff does not allege this more severe scenario of price dictation. Rather, plaintiff points to the much less suspect policy that 
allows defendant to control the advertising of its products in the marketplace. "
1726,10," Section Two of the Sherman Act prohibits unilateral action when the manufacturer acts as a monopolistic power in the relevant 
market. See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767. Plaintiff has not alleged a Section Two violation in this action, and the issue of 
monopoly power wielded by defendant will be not addressed. "
1728,11," Indeed, on the causality requirement as well as the balance of hardships showing, it appears from the record before the court 
that plaintiff's loss of business, if any, is from its poor dealings with its customers as well as failing to adhere to legitimate 
contract obligations. "
1806,1," One set of payments was to be made immediately after the MSA was executed and annually thereafter, on January 10, from 
2000 through 2003. These base payments totaled $ 12,741,925,944. MSA Art. IX(b). The second set of payments was to be 
made annually ""on April 15, 2000 and on April 15 of each year thereafter in perpetuity,"" increasing from $ 4.5 billion in 2000 to $ 
9 billion annually beginning in 2018. The second set of payments totals $ 207.89 billion between 2000 and 2025. MSA Art. 
IX(c)(1). The third set of payments was to be made annually ""on April 15, 2008 and on April 15 each year thereafter through 
2017."" The payments were in the amount of $ 861 million per year, or $ 8.61 billion in total. MSA Art. IX(c)(2). The three sets of 
payments combined have been called ""the largest privately negotiated redistribution of wealth in world history."" Margaret A. 
Little, A Most Dangerous Indiscretion: The Legal, Economic, and Political Legacy of the Governments' Tobacco Litigation, 33 
Conn. L. Rev. 1143, 1171 (2001). "
1807,2," The 2% disproportion seems to mitigate slightly an aggregate decrease in payments to the states. Any decrease in payments 
under the Volume Adjustment is subject to reduction - that is, the OPMs' payments are adjusted downwards somewhat less, 
according to a complex formula - if the aggregate operating income of the OPMs from yearly sales of cigarettes in and to the 
United States exceeds $ 7.195 billion (adjusted upward for inflation). MSA Art. II(aaa), Exh. E(B)(ii)."
1807,3," All payment calculations in the MSA are made on the basis of statistical data of the previous year. Thus the payments due on 
April 15, 2004, for instance, are based on audited and certified manufacturers' 2003 statistics regarding volume of sales, 
percentage of market share, and the like. See, e.g., MSA Art. II(mm), Exh. E(C)."
1807,4," For non-grandfathered SPMs, 1997 and 1998 market share are defined as zero, so that the formula collapses to current market 
share divided by current aggregate market share of OPMs. MSA Art. IX(i)(4). Any manufacturer which consented to join the MSA 
more than sixty days after its initial execution by the OPMs becomes a nongrandfathered SPM. MSA Art. IX(i)(4). Both by 
number of manufacturers and by volume of sales, the majority of manufacturers which became SPMs did so within the first sixty 
days after the MSA's execution and became grandfathered. "
1808,5," The NPM Adjustment applies to the second and third sets of OPM payments, which account for all but $ 12.74 billion of the 
OPMs' aggregate payments. MSA Art. IX(c)(1), (2). The NPM Adjustment also applies to SPM payments. MSA Art. IX(i)(3)."
1808,6," If a state enacts and fully defends the model escrow statute, but it is invalidated by a court, the state may still avoid 65% of the 
NPM Adjustment. MSA Art. IX(d)(2)(F)."
1808,7," The escrow payment was $ .0094241 per cigarette, or $ 1.88482 per carton, in 1999, and it rises to $ .0188482 per cigarette, or 
$ 3.76964 per carton, beginning in 2007. MSA Exh. T; N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp(2)(a)(1), (v). A pack contains twenty 
cigarettes and a carton contains ten packs, so that a carton equals 200 cigarettes. "
1809,8," This figure represents the average of cigarettes sold without payment, pursuant to the grandfather clause and cigarettes sold 
with payments of increasing proportions for sales above grandfathered levels."
1809,9," Because the Escrow Statute required NPMs to pay a stated amount per cigarette sold, the figures for payments per carton 
should, in theory, be strict multiples of the figures for payments per cigarette provided by the Escrow Statute. For instance, the 
Escrow Statute provides that in 2003, NPMs pay $ .0167539 per cigarette sold; because there are 200 cigarettes in a carton, 
one would expect that the figure for NPM payments per carton should be $ 3.35078. The figures provided by PriceWaterhouse 
for NPM payments per carton, per year, are somewhat higher: $ 3.96144 per carton for 2003, for example. Presumably the "
1810,," difference stems from the Escrow Statute's requirement that its figures be adjusted for inflation. See N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 
1399-pp(2)(a). Neither party presented arguments regarding this point."
1810,10," Jeffrey Avo Uvezian, the President of plaintiff International Tobacco Partners, Ltd. (""ITP""), states that his company imports 
Grand Tobacco cigarettes, which had an escrow obligation to Hawaii of less than ten dollars and does not intend to sell more 
cigarettes in that state. ""To avoid the time and expense of opening an escrow account and maintaining it for 25 years for about 
ten dollars, ITP . . . offered to pay the amount due directly to Hawaii. . . . No matter how we proposed to structure the 
transaction, [Hawaii] refused to accept the money, stating that . . . the only way for ITP to fulfill its obligation was for ITP to sign 
an escrow agreement, establish the required sub-account, name a registered agent, and hold the money for 25 years."""
1810,11," This data was provided by plaintiffs and attributed to PriceWaterhouse. The figures have been rounded. The State provided 
figures attached to the Declaration of Patricia Tilton, a principal at PriceWaterhouse. The figures attached to the Tilton 
Declaration are similar to those above, with slight and generally inconsequential variations. An exception is the figures for 2001, 
when a different categorization altered the market size by 15 billion cigarettes. The figures used here give a more accurate 
picture of the 2001 market, and are otherwise closely enough confirmed by the Tilton Declaration figures that I accept them as 
reliable. "
1812,12," Because New York's allocable share is high, plaintiffs explain, many NPMs avoided selling cigarettes in New York and decided 
to sell instead elsewhere in the country, where they could recover a higher percentage of their escrow payments. For instance, 
plaintiff International Tobacco Partners, Ltd. (""ITP"") has sold no cigarettes in New York since before 2000, but sold 
approximately 23 million Tough Guy cigarettes and 61 million Boston cigarettes in Kentucky in 2002, and 38 million Tough Guys 
and 44 million Boston cigarettes in 2003. ITP made escrow deposits for both Tough Guys and Bostons sold in Kentucky in 2003; 
because Kentucky's allocable share is 1.7611586%, ITP could recover over 98% of the escrow payments it made on sales in 
Kentucky. Logically and arithmetically, however, an NPM could just as effectively concentrate its distribution into the New York 
market, with its large smoking population, and gain regional competitive advantage in this market. "
1813,13," Judge Ralph K. Winter wrote the decision on behalf of Judge Sonia Sotomayor and himself. 357 F.3d at 208. Judge Robert D. 
Sack concurred in a separate opinion. Id. at 235 (Sack, J., concurring). "
1814,14," See, e.g., 357 F.3d at 208 (""appellants allege - and at this stage we must assume their allegations to be true""); 209 (""Because

entitled to attempt to prove it.""); 157 (""It is too soon to say whether the state will ultimately be able to elicit evidence sufficient to 
meet this second prong.""). "
1822,16," A manufacturer, suffering an increase of costs, will normally wish to raise prices even more than necessary to recoup costs, in 
order to maintain desired profit margins and to compensate for reduced sales volume at the higher price level. The MSA 
provides, in such event, that the manufacturer's profits may prevent it from being entitled to the discount to the extent otherwise 
available for reduced sales volume. MSA Exh. E(b)(ii) reduces the OPMs' benefit from the Volume Adjustment if their income 
rises while volume of sales falls. However, the clause provides for only a percentage decrease in the Volume Adjustment, and it 
is possible, therefore, that OPMs may still increase their profits from price increases, even if they result in lower sales. The 
proofs did not treat this issue."
1822,17," The formula of increase is provided in MSA Art. IX(i)(2). Freedom Holdings II, 363 F.3d at 153, cites it as an example of an 
unlawful restraint on trade. "
1825,18," To the extent that any payment whatever could be seen as raising prices and restricting output, the Court of Appeals has laid 
such arguments to rest by ruling that a flat tax would be permissible, and such payments do not constitute per se violations of 
the antitrust laws because they are substantially justified by the public health gains which they advance. Freedom Holdings I,

1828,19," I do not intend any implication regarding the State's exposure to a monetary judgment in an antitrust case under the Eleventh

1843,1," We refer to Qwest Corp. and its predecessors simply as ""Qwest."" "
1844,2," MetroNet also asserted a state law cause of action for breach of con-tract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing. This cause of action was dismissed without prejudice by the district court on May 2, 2000 and is not before us."
1844,3," ""F"" stands for ""flat-rate"" and ""B"" stands for ""business."" Flat-rate residential service is known as ""1FR."""
1844,4," MetroNet stresses that the access component itself consists of two subcomponents: the physical line between the customer 
and Qwest's switch, called the network access channel (""NAC""), and a device that limits the number of lines that have access, 
called the network access register (""NAR""). Because our analysis does not depend on this further level of detail, we do not refer 
to it in the text."
1844,5, MetroNet has not alleged or argued that Qwest has engaged in illegal tying.
1844,6," A PBX allows four-digit internal calling and can provide some features. External dialing is done through Qwest's local network

1847,11," MetroNet argues that Verizon has no impact on its case because of the differences in procedural posture. Verizon was 
decided on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), see Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP v. Bell Atlantic 
Corp., 305 F.3d 89, 95-96 (2d Cir. 2002), whereas the district court resolved this case on a motion for summary judgment. 
MetroNet says that our previous conclusion that it had created triable issues of fact is not disturbed by Verizon. Nonetheless, Verizon affected whether Qwest's conduct can be considered anticompetitive as a matter of law. See Verizon, 124 
S. Ct. at 879; see also SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of Cal., Inc., 88 F.3d 780, 783 (9th Cir. 1996) (""Whether 
specific conduct is anti-competitive is a question of law reviewed de novo.""). Contrary to MetroNet's contention, the procedural 
differences, if anything, make it more difficult for Metro-Net's claims to survive summary judgment because the Court's dismissal 
in Verizon implied that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief. See id. (""A complaint should not be 
dismissed [under Rule 12(b)(6)] unless it appears beyond doubt that [the] plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his 
claim which would entitle him to relief.""). Thus, Verizon raises the threshold with respect to the facts that MetroNet must plead 
and prove to establish an antitrust violation. "
1848,12," The Court also distinguished Otter Tail on this basis. See Verizon, 124 S. Ct. at 880. "
1849,13," The record contains conflicting evidence about MetroNet's profitability after Qwest implemented per location pricing in 1997, 
but we take the facts in the light most favorable to MetroNet as we must on summary judgment."
1849,14," Price discrimination describes the practice of charging different prices to different customers for essentially the same product 
or service. More technically, price discrimination occurs when a firm sells to different groups of customers at differing ratios of 
price to marginal cost. See 3 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 721b, at 262 (2d ed. 2002). It appears that Qwest is able 
to price discriminate among consumers because small businesses have a lower elasticity of demand than large businesses. In 
other words, large businesses are more sensitive to changes in price due to the availability of substitutes to Centrex, namely 
PBXs. Small businesses are willing to pay a higher price for Centrex because fewer substitutes for Centrex are available to 
them."
1849,15," Qwest discriminates in price among different types of direct consumers (small businesses versus large businesses) but does 
not discriminate between competitors and direct consumers. "
1850,16," The Supreme Court recognized, however, that the regulatory scheme created by the 1996 Act does not shield regulated 
entities from antitrust scrutiny altogether under the doctrine of implied immunity. Verizon, 124 S. Ct. at 878. "
1851,17," There is no evidence in the record, however, that MetroNet filed a petition to reclassify Centrex features as a noncompetitive 
service or a complaint that per location pricing for Centrex features was unfair, unjust or unreasonable. "
1866,1," Asahi also owns a company called Glaverbel, which was associated with AFG, and a Canadian-based company called 
Glaverbec."
1866,2," A company named Cardinal Glass Industries (""Cardinal"") accounted for approximately 3 of domestic flat glass sales in 1995. 
Cardinal, which is not a defendant in this suit, did not produce flat glass until 1992, when it purchased a flat glass manufacturing 
plant that AFG built for it. Before that time, Cardinal fabricated products from flat glass it purchased from PPG and others. "
1867,3," The parties fail to adequately explain the relationship between OEM glass parts and automotive replacement parts, which 
plaintiffs describe as ""identical in composition."" Plaintiffs' Br. 4. We gather from the record that they differ in two important 
respects. First, generally (but not always) only one OEM glass producer exists for any particular product. Thus PPG alone might 
produce a particular windshield that a car manufacturer uses in a particular model car. In contrast, multiple manufacturers 
typically produce any one type of automotive replacement part. So PPG, Guardian, and LOF might produce the automotive 
replacement part that would replace the OEM product that only PPG produced and sold to the car manufacturer. Second, OEM 
glass products are sold to a particular car manufacturer, whereas the corresponding identical automotive replacement glass 
products are sold to multiple wholesalers and retail installers."
1867,4," Automotive replacement glass fabricators produced approximately 10,000 different automotive replacement glass products. No 
one fabricator produced all 10,000. PPG produced approximately 6,000. App. 585. "
1868,5," The District Court catalogued these price increases as follows: July of 1991, all defendants raised their prices within days of each other by 7.5-9 %, with an effective date of July 29 or 
August 1, 1991; September of 1992, all defendants raised their prices within days of each other by 5-9 % with an effective 
date of October 1 or October 12; May of 1993, defendants raised their prices within days of each other by 5.5 % with an 
effective date of June 7 or 9; October of 1993, defendants raised their prices within days of each other by 6. 5% with an 
effective date of October 30 or November 1, 1993; April of 1994 all defendants raised their prices by 5-9 % with an effective 
date of May 1 or 2; August of 1994, all defendants raised their prices by 5-8 % with an effective date of September 19, 
1994; March of 1995, all defendants raised their prices by 6 % with an effective date of April 3 or 11. App. 16 n.4 (internal citations to District Court record omitted)."
1868,6," HN1[
] We exercise plenary review over the District Court's grant of summary judgment. See, e.g., InterVest Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., 340 F.3d 144, 158 (3d Cir. 2003). "
1870,7," The ""strictures of Matsushita do not apply"" when a plaintiff provides direct evidence of a conspiracy. Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 
1233. That is because ""no inferences are required from direct evidence to establish a fact and thus a court need not be 
concerned about the reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from such evidence."" Id. In addition, ""the focus in Matsushita 
was on ambiguous evidence, and what inferences reasonably could be drawn from that evidence."" Id. (internal citation omitted)."
1870,8," As one prominent antitrust commentator has explained: Matsushita spoke in the context of a highly improbable twenty-year-long predatory pricing conspiracy and required high-
quality evidence to permit such a conspiracy to be presented to a jury. . . . However, Matsushita itself said little about proof 
requirements in a case where underlying structural evidence indicates that the offense is quite plausible and would be 
profitable for the defendants. Herbert Hovenkamp, The Rationalization of Antitrust, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 917, 925-26 (2003) (reviewing Richard A. Posner, 
Antitrust Law (2d ed. 2001)). "
1871,9," A leading antitrust scholar, who now authors the Areeda treatise, has characterized these cases at least in part as ""an 
unfortunate misinterpretation"" of Matsushita. Herbert Hovenkamp, The Rationalization of Antitrust, 116 Harv. L. Rev. at 925 
(""Unfortunately, many courts have read Matsushita as requiring a certain quantum evidence of verbal agreement before 
summary judgment can be avoided."")."
1871,10," ""For example, in a market of one hundred sellers of equal size, an expansion in output of 20 percent by one of them will result 
in an average fall in output of only about .2 percent for each of the others, so a seller need not worry in making his pricing 
decisions about the reactions of his rivals."" Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 56 (2nd ed. 2001). But if ""there are three sellers of 
equal size, a 20 percent expansion in the sales of one will cause the sales of each of the others to fall by an average of 10 
percent--a sales loss the victims can hardly overlook."" Id. "
1872,11," HN15[
] Thus in order to establish illegal concerted action based on ""consciously parallel behavior, a plaintiff must show (1) 
that the defendants' behavior was parallel; (2) that the defendants were conscious of each other's conduct and that this 
awareness was an element in their decision-making process; and (3) certain 'plus' factors."" Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1242,quoted 
in Intervest, 340 F.3d at 165. It is undisputed that the first two circumstances exist here, and we therefore concentrate on the 
third and final. "
1873,12," Neither factor is ""strictly necessary."" In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, 295 F.3d 651, 655 (7th Cir. 2002). 
Thus this type of economic evidence is neither necessary nor sufficient to conclude that sufficient proof of an agreement exists 
to preclude summary judgment, but it is relevant and courts should as a general matter consider it. We also observe that certain types of ""actions against self interest"" may do more than restate economic interdependence. For 
example, non-price acts against self-interest, such as apparently unilateral exchanges of confidential price information, cannot 
simply be explained as a result of oligopolostic interdependence. See Blomkest Fertilizer, Inc., 203 F.3d at 1046-47 (Gibson, J., 
dissenting). "
1874,13," PPG argued before the District Court, for example, that ""controlling case law precludes an antitrust plaintiff from avoiding 
summary judgment by reliance on evidence relating to list prices."" App. 667. PPG misstates the law. Declining transaction prices 
will tend to support a conclusion that competitors did not enter into an agreement to fix prices where the other record evidence 
also fails to sufficiently prove an agreement. See, e.g., Clamp-All Corp., 851 F.2d at 484 (""The fact that [the defendants] often 
set prices that deviated from their price lists helps support the inference that the similarity of price lists reflects individual 
decisions to copy, rather than any more formal pricing agreement.""). Our decision in In re Baby Food is not to the contrary. In the 
specific factual setting of that case--involving ""hundreds of products"" and multiple complicated discounts and price promotions--
we concluded that plaintiffs' and their experts' use of list price data was insufficient to show that parallel pricing had occurred. 
166 F.3d at 128-29. Significantly, the defendants made ""similar pricing decisions"" 15.5 of the time and priced their products 
differently 84.5 of the time. Id. at 128. The District Court therefore concluded, in a portion of its decision that we cited with 
approval, that the plaintiffs were ""unable to show that defendants' prices moved in a parallel fashion. That is true both for list 
prices and transaction prices."" Id."
1874,14," PPG does not argue that LOF's proffer is not admissible, and we therefore assume that it is for purposes of this decision. In 
any case, however, we would reach the same result even if we did not consider LOF's proffer. "
1875,15," AFG raised the price of its ""pattern glass"" by 4 %, its ""thin glass products"" by 5 %, its ""gray and bronze thicknesses"" by 9 %, 
and its ""4mm-12mm"" also by 9 %. App. 3552."
1875,16," LOF's proffer to the DOJ identified Nightingale as an individual ""involved in the 1992 activities."" App. 5003. It also stated that 
Nightingale had ""discussions with [an AFG executive] that resulted in a price move."" App. 5004. Nightingale invoked his Fifth 
Amendment privilege against self incrimination when plaintiffs sought to depose him."
1875,17," PPG on the other hand argues that there is evidence suggesting that someone typed the note on the June 28 announcement 
after its competitors announced their price increases. PPG is undoubtedly correct; this document's time frame is a disputed fact 
and a finder of fact could reasonably reach the conclusion PPG urges us to draw. But a fact finder could also reasonably 
conclude the opposite, and it is black letter law that we must draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor at this point in the 
proceedings. "
1876,18," A fuller excerpt from the cited portion of the record states: Glaverbec appears to have quieted down just a bit in terms of new aggressive pricing, seemingly for the first time to be 
content with current absurdly low prices. Significantly, for the first time, Glaverbec is reported to have said that their tank is 
sold out. All producers, including PPG, continue to react selectively to Glaverbec's pricing and attempt to protect selected 
customers and selected markets. Discussion and rumors surrounding a possible price increase later in the year are widespread in the market place. No one, 
however, believes that demand will be robust enough to support a price increase without significant discipline on the part of 
all float producers. App. 5841. "
1877,19," Even if this statement does not unambiguously tend to show that flat glass producers agreed ahead of time to raise prices, it at 
least tends to show that there was an agreement to maintain higher prices despite competitive demands (i.e. to ""make it stick"")."
1877,20," The full excerpt from the record reads: Certainly the hot topic on the pricing front is the industry increase announced during September to be effective in October. 
Basic supply and demand do not support this increase, so it will require discipline on the part of each manufacturer. 
Glaverbec, Guardian's mirror operations and AFG's distribution arm are keys to the success of the increase. App. 5908."
1877,21," Kennedy was an officer and director of AFG. Although Teat did not have pricing authority, his precise position at LOF is 
unclear from the record."
1877,22," A fuller excerpt stated: A price increase has been initiated in Eastern Canada by PPG to be effective March 22; 7 % increase for all clear, uncased 
product (2.3mm through 6.0mm) and a 9 % increase for clear cased product. It is anticipated that this increase will be a 
lead into a U.S. domestic price increase in the May-June timeframe. LOF is following the Canadian lead and including 
heavy clear and tint product with the increase. App. 4031."
1877,23," In addition, Ford's business plan (dated April 29, 1993) also referred to a 5 % price increase. App. 3698. Under the heading 
""Possible Opportunities and Improvements,"" it stated: ""A 5 % market price increase spurred by cyclical recovery with increased 
industry capacity utilization would increase profits by almost $ 3 million."" App. 3697-98."
1877,24," PPG urges that AFG did not send the fax on April 16, 1993, arguing that the most likely explanation for the date's appearance 
on the fax is that the fax machine malfunctioned. PPG is free to make this argument to a jury, but surely a reasonable finder of 
fact could infer that the date on the fax means that it was sent on that day. "
1878,25," A fuller excerpt stated: The price increase of 5.5 % announced in early May by all major float producers for an implementation on or about June 7 
has had the effect of stabilizing prices. Overall customer reaction to the increase has been favorable, particularly in the 
mirror and distributor/ fabricator segments. Sash accounts who are not price protected are resisting the increased [sic], to a 
degree. The modest amount of the increase, the perceived cost justification for the increase, and the firmness to date of all 
float producers, however, are all positive factors which project that the announced prices will hold. The highest degree of 
uncertainty resides on the West Coast, which has the lowest level of industry capacity utilization. App. 5906. "
1880,26," The multiplier for domestic windshields, for example, was 4.06. App. 2980."
1880,27," PPG, Ford and LOF increased the price of windshields by 7 % and tempered parts by 8 %, for example, in February-March of 
1992. App. 5913, 5917, 7184. Similarly, in January-February of 1992 they increased windshield prices by 9 % and tempered 
parts by 10 %. App. 4899, 7192, 7187."
1880,28," A fuller excerpt states: In the 1950s, manufacturers were in conflict over their published list prices. As a neutral party NAGS was asked to assign 
list prices to NAGS part numbers, establishing the NAGS List Price. These prices reflected the industry practice of 
discounting and were based on manufacturers' truckload prices. NAGS started publishing the part numbers with prices, 
establishing the 'NAGS calculator'. App. 6444-45 (emphasis added)."
1880,29," We do not address the District Court's other evidentiary rulings, such as its decision to exclude the transcript of Skeddle's 
grand jury testimony. Plaintiffs opine that the District Court erred when it excluded the testimony, but they do not appeal from 
that decision. Plaintiffs' Br. 18. "
1881,30," There is apparently some amount of overlap between the two categories of notes: LOF had already produced a portion of the

1882,31," Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) provides: HN25[

1883,," (3) Statement against interest. A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary 
or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the 
declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless 
believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused 
is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement. Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). We note that the Confrontation Clause raises some additional issues about admissibility of such 
testimony in a criminal case, but those concerns are irrelevant in this civil case. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 158 
L. Ed. 2d 177, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004)."
1883,32," In this regard, the District Court should determine whether, because the statements at issue were diary entries, Skeddle 
believed that they would be seen by anyone. This may bear on whether they qualify as statements against interest. See Zenith

1884,34," The District Court characterized the admissibility of coconspirator statements as an ""exception to the hearsay rule."" Rules 803 
and 804 set forth exceptions to the hearsay rule; that is, they explain when statements are admissible even though they qualify 
as hearsay. HN28[
] Rule 801(d), however, sets forth statements that are admissible because they do not constitute hearsay, including statements ""by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy."" Fed. R. Evid. 
801(d)(2)(E). "
1885,35," PPG argues that the District Court concluded that the statements in Skeddle's notes were not in furtherance of any conspiracy, 
ostensibly because--as PPG argues--Skeddle did not create the notes at the same time as the events he purports to describe in 
them. But nothing in the Court's decision indicates that this was a basis for its determination that the statements were 
inadmissible. The District Court will surely consider PPG's arguments in this regard on remand."
1885,36," The District Court also concluded that the Queen's File and non-Queen's File notes did not fall within the business records 
exception of Rule 803(6). App. 47, 56-57. And the Court found that the ""Queen's File does not qualify as an admission by a party 
opponent under Rules 801(d)(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D)."" App. 57-58. Plaintiffs do not argue that the District Court erred in these 
determinations, and we therefore do not address them. "
1886,37," PPG also argues that we should affirm the District Court's decision because a reasonable jury could not conclude that PPG 
committed the ""other bad acts""--conspiring in the OEM market--that plaintiffs argue tend to show that PPG conspired to fix the 
prices of flat glass. See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 689, 99 L. Ed. 2d 771, 108 S. Ct. 1496 (1988). The District

favorable to the nonmoving party (i.e., the Dealers).  George C. Frey Ready-Mixed Concrete, Inc. v. Pall Hill Concrete Mix Corp., 
554 F.2d 551, 553 (2d Cir. 1977); 5ACharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1368 (2d ed. 
1990)."
1926,4," The three Dealer Agreements at issue are entitled ""Distributor Sales Agreements"" (CLM and Clark) and ""Grader Dealer 
Agreement"" (FEC). We refer to each as a Dealer Agreement. "
1927,5," According to Volvo, its competing manufacturers typically market a full line of construction equipment, and their dealers offer 
""one-stop shopping"" for such products."
1927,6," Both Volvo and NFC are Delaware corporations. NFC, as a defendant, would have destroyed diversity in the North Carolina 
Litigation. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. With NFC no longer a defendant in the North Carolina Litigation, no diversity issue is raised, 
and none is apparent."
1927,7," Volvo's Second Amended Complaint in the North Carolina Litigation sought the following: (1) a declaration pursuant to the 
Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1051, et seq.) of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and dilution; (2) a declaration that the 
Lanham Act preempted any state law claims that were inconsistent therewith; (3) a declaration that there had been no breach of 
contract by Volvo; (4) a declaration that there are no ancillary tort law claims against Volvo; and (5) a declaration that Volvo had 
not violated any state statutes. Volvo's Second Amended Complaint is the operative complaint in this appeal. "
1928,8," The Dealers asserted twelve claims against Volvo in the Arkansas Litigation and in the North Carolina Litigation. Those claims 
were for (1) violations of the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act, Ark. Code § 4-72-201, et seq.; (2) violations of the Texas Farm, 
Industrial and Outdoor Power Equipment Dealer Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 19.01, et seq.; (3) violations of the Texas 
Deceptive Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.41, et seq.; (4) violations of the Michigan 
Motor Vehicle Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann., Ch. 445.1561, et seq.; (5) violations of the Louisiana Dealer Act, La. Rev. Stat. § 
51:481, et seq. ; (6) violations of Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act; (7) violations of the South Carolina Fair Practices of Farm, 
Construction, Industrial and Outdoor Power Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, S.C. Code 
Ann. § 39-6-10, et seq.; (8) breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (9) tortious interference with 
contractual relations and prospective economic advantage; (10) unjust enrichment; (11) estoppel; and (12) recoupment."
1928,9," We recognize that HN2[
] an award of partial judgment on the pleadings does not generally constitute an appealable order. 
See Am. Canoe Ass'n, Inc. v. Murphy Farms, Inc., 326 F.3d 505, 511 (4th Cir. 2003). This appeal is not interlocutory, however, 
because Volvo has voluntarily dismissed its remaining claims. Volvo Trademark, No. 1: 00CV238, No. 1: 01CV232, No. 1: 
01CV122 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 2, 2003). "
1930,10," In its Complaint, Volvo sought a ""declaratory judgment with respect to [its] rights and obligations under certain contracts …."" 
Complaint P 3. And, in assessing whether an actual controversy existed between Volvo and the Dealers under the Complaint, 
the magistrate judge observed that Volvo ""runs the risk of incurring multiple liabilities if [it does] not seek judicial interpretation 
and clarification of [its] rights in respect to the contracts ….Without a doubt, there is an active and immediate controversy among 
these plaintiffs and defendants …."" Volvo Trademark, No. 1: 00CV238 (W.D.N.C. April 9, 2001)."
1930,11," On February 2, 2000, Champion dealer N.A. Burkitt, Inc. initiated litigation against Volvo in the District of Maine alleging, inter 
alia, that Volvo's termination of its dealer agreement contravened the Maine Motor Vehicle Dealers Act. On August 28, 2000, a 
defendant in Volvo's original complaint in North Carolina (i. e., NFC) commenced litigation against Volvo in Texas, contending, 
inter alia, that Volvo could not terminate its dealer agreement without cause."
1930,12," The initiation of litigation against Volvo and the threats of future litigation distinguish this dispute from North Jefferson, a 
decision on which the Dealers rely. There, the district court determined that a controversy was not present under the Declaratory 
Judgment Act because the defendant had not taken any action, even of a preliminary nature, against the plaintiff, and the 
defendant had not indicated that it intended to take any future legal action against the plaintiff. N. Jefferson, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 
718. See generally GTE Directories Pub. Corp. v. Trimen Am., Inc., 67 F.3d 1563 (11th Cir. 1995) (holding that threat of future 
litigation gives rise to actual controversy). "
1931,13," The factual predicate underlying this appeal is analogous to the factual underpinnings of Kapiloff. There, we concluded that a 
""declaratory judgment action is designed to allay exactly the sort of uncertainty that flows from the threat that ambiguous 
contractual rights may be asserted,"" and we observed that a ""declaratory judgment action allows the uncertain party to gain relief 
from the insecurity caused by a potential suit waiting in the wings."" Kapiloff, 155 F.3d at 494. The Dealers acknowledge that a federal court may exercise its declaratory judgment jurisdiction when a plaintiff is seeking a 
declaration to avoid the accrual of potential damages for past actions. See Tempco Elec. Heater Corp. v. Omega Eng'g, Inc., 
819 F.2d 746, 749 (7th Cir. 1987) (observing that declaratory judgment is available where party desires declaration of legal 
effect of proposed or past course of action). In this dispute, Volvo was seeking such a declaration."
1931,14," Volvo also contends that, in the absence of the Without Cause Provision, its terminations of the Dealer Agreements would not 
constitute breaches of contract because ""the Market Withdrawal Provision contemplates the possibility that Champion could 
completely disappear from the marketplace without liability following a discontinuation of the CHAMPION line of motor graders."" 
The Market Withdrawal Provision provides: Champion reserves the right at any time to change models, classification of models and specifications, or add to or 
discontinue any products or product lines without notice to [Dealer or Distributor] and without incurring any obligation to 
incorporate such changes in any other products. CLM, Clark, and FEC Dealer Agreements § 27. According to Volvo, any interpretation of the Market Withdrawal Provision that 
would not permit Champion to withdraw from the marketplace would render meaningless the phrase ""discontinue any product or 
product lines."" The Dealers contend, however, that in order to ""withdraw from the market,"" Volvo would have to cease producing "
1932,," motor graders at the Champion factory - the simple act of relabeling does not constitute a withdrawal from the marketplace. As 
the district court observed, however: Volvo did not terminate the dealership contracts by virtue of discontinuing Champion Road motor graders or withdrawing 
that product from the market; the contracts were terminated pursuant to the provision … for termination without cause. Opinion at 543-44."
1932,15," The Seventh Circuit's decision in Cromeens was filed on November 7, 2003, a month after this appeal was argued. One of the 
issues in Cromeens was whether, under their programs of Volvoization and Dealer Rationalization, AB Volvo, Volvo Excavators 
AB, and Volvo Construction Equipment NV could terminate the dealers of Samsung construction equipment without cause. The 
dealer agreements in Cromeens contained a termination clause analogous to the Without Cause Provision. Cromeens, 349 F.3d 
376, 2003 WL 22519825, at *11. On appeal, the Samsung dealers maintained that the ""without cause"" provision in the Samsung 
dealer agreements was ambiguous. The Seventh Circuit rejected this contention, ruling that the language of the ""without cause"" 
provision ""could not be more plain."" 349 F.3d 376, [WL] at *13. The Seventh Circuit then concluded that the dealer agreements 
unambiguously permitted termination of the Samsung dealers without cause. Id. "
1933,16," The Integration Clause specifically provides: This agreement and [any] accompanying Exhibits contain the entire and only agreement between the parties respecting the 
sale to and purchase and distribution by [Dealer or Distributor] of Products and Parts, and any representations, terms or 
conditions in connection therewith not incorporated herein shall not be binding upon either party. This agreement wholly 
cancels, terminates and supersedes any agreement heretofore entered into between the parties, or their successors or 
assigns, pertaining to Products and Parts. CLM and Clark Dealer Agreements § 32.1; FEC Dealer Agreement § 33.1. "
1934,17," The Modification Clause provides: This agreement, and any modification, renewal, waiver, extension or termination hereof, shall not be valid unless in writing 
and signed by a duly authorized officer of Champion. FEC Dealer Agreement § 33.2; CLM and Clark Dealer Agreements § 32.2 (omitting ""waiver""). "
1936,18," The Choice-of-Law Provision in the Clark and CLM Dealer Agreements provides: This Agreement has been formalized in South Carolina, and the rights, duties and obligations of the parties as set forth 
herein shall be determined according to the laws of the State of South Carolina. CLM and Clark Dealer Agreements § 29. The Choice-of-Law Provision in the FEC agreement provides: This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the Province of Ontario. FEC Dealer Agreement § 29. "
1937,19," The Local Law Provision provides: The rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be subject to all applicable laws, orders, regulations, directions, 
restrictions and limitations of governments and government agencies having jurisdiction over the parties hereto. In the 
event that [a local] law, order, regulation, direction, restriction or limitation, appropriation, …or interpretation thereof shall, in 
the judgment of either party hereto substantially alter the relationship between the parties under this Agreement or the 
advantages derived from such relationship, either party may request the other hereto to modify this Agreement. CLM, Clark, and FEC Dealer Agreements § 30 (emphasis added)."
1937,20," In support of their contention that the Local Law Provision mandates that the State Statutes govern the Dealer Agreements, 
the Dealers rely on two decisions, Sutter Home Winery, Inc. v. Vintage Selections, Ltd., 971 F.2d 401 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lake 
Charles Diesel, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 328 F.3d 192 (5th Cir. 2003). Their reliance on these decisions, however, is 
misplaced. The agreement at issue in Sutter Home expressly provided that, ""except as otherwise required by applicable law, this 
Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of California."" Sutter Home, 971 F.2d at 406 (emphasis added). This 
language is absent from the Dealer Agreements. The agreement at issue in Lake Charles provided that ""any provision which 
contravenes the laws of any state or jurisdiction where this Agreement is to be performed will be deemed not a part of this 
Agreement in such state or jurisdiction."" Lake Charles, 328 F.3d at 197 n. 10. No such provision exists in the Dealer 
Agreements."
1937,21," We recognize that the ""Supreme Court has consistently accorded choice of forum and choice of law provisions presumptive 
validity."" Allen v. Lloyd's of London, 94 F.3d 923, 928 (4th Cir. 1996). "
1939,22," In 1999, the Texas Legislature amended the Texas Equipment Act so that a ""dealer"" under the Act included dealers engaged 
in the retail sale of off-road construction equipment. The Legislature provided, however, that ""an agreement entered into before 
the effective date of this Act [Sept. 1, 1999] is governed by the law in effect on the date the agreement was entered into …."" 
1999 Tex. Gen. Laws § 4, 76th Leg., Ch. 725 (emphasis added). FEC acquired its Champion dealership in 1996; thus the 1999 
amendments to the Texas Equipment Act have no application to its Dealer Agreement."
1939,23," The Supreme Court of Texas, the court possessing the final authority in all Texas civil cases, has not addressed the issue of 
whether, pursuant to a dealer agreement analogous to FEC's, a vendee is a consumer under the DTPA. Because there is no 
reason to believe the Supreme Court of Texas would disagree with the Texas Court of Appeals (an intermediate appellate court 
of Texas) on this issue, we must rely on that court in discerning Texas law. See West v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237, 
85 L. Ed. 139, 61 S. Ct. 179 (1940) (holding that HN30[
] state intermediate appellate court's judgment on rule of law is datum 
for ascertaining state law and should not be disregarded by federal court unless it is convinced by persuasive data that highest 
court of state would decide otherwise). "
1940,24," Under both the dealer agreement in Fisher and FEC's Dealer Agreement, the relationship between the manufacturer and 
dealer was that of vendor and vendee. FEC Dealer Agreement § 21. And like the valves and instruments provided to ACI by 
Fisher, Champion Motor Graders were sold to FEC at dealer net prices for resale. Id. §§ 9.1, 12.4. "
1941,25," If every statutory provision expressed a state's fundamental policy, contracting parties would be entitled to apply the law of 
another state under the Second Restatement only when the law of the chosen state was the same as that of the state where the 
contract was made. Cherokee Pump & Equip. Inc., 38 F.3d at 252 (characterizing such proposition as ""ridiculous"")."
1941,26," We note that, in assessing whether the Arkansas Act or the Louisiana Act embodies a fundamental state policy, we would be 
bound by any relevant precedent of the Arkansas or Louisiana courts. Because there is none, and because our Court has not 
heretofore addressed such an issue, we are constrained to examine the decisions of our sister circuits addressing these and 
similar dealer protection statutes."
1941,27," Unlike the Arkansas Act, the Louisiana Act does not contain an antiwaiver provision. "
1943,28," Pursuant to the anti-waiver provision of the Maine Law, it is unlawful for a manufacturer, without good cause, ""to cancel …a 
franchise relationship with a distributor or dealer, notwithstanding …the terms or provisions of a waiver …."" 10 M.R.S.A. § 
1363(3)(B)."
1943,29," The requirements for enacting an emergency clause in Arkansas are explained in Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution: If it shall be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety that a measure shall become effective 
without delay, such necessity shall be stated in one section, and if upon a yea and nay vote two-thirds of all members 
elected to each house …shall vote upon separate roll call in favor of the measure going into immediate operation, such 
emergency measure shall become effective without delay. Ark. Const. amend. 7. HN39[
] In interpreting an Arkansas statute, courts may look to the emergency clause to determine 
legislative intent. Quinney v. Pittman, 320 Ark. 177, 895 S.W.2d 538, 542 (Ark. 1995). "
1945,1," A dealer is defined by statute to mean ""any farm dealer, heavy industrial equipment dealer, construction equipment dealer, 
material handling equipment dealer, utility equipment dealer, engines equipment dealer, lawn and garden equipment dealer or 
retail equipment distributor dealer."" La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  § 51:481(B)(3) (West 2003)."
1945,2," An agent is defined by statute to mean ""any manufacturer, wholesaler or wholesale distributor."" La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  § 51: 
481(B)(4) (West 2003). "
1948,3," The rule of lex loci contractus means ""the law of the place where the contract is made governs the contract."" Joye v. Heuer, 
813 F. Supp. 1171, 1173 (D.S.C. 1993) (citing Livingston v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 176 S.C. 385, 180 S.E. 343, 345 (S.C. 
1935)). "
1950,4," ""And Arkansas has a materially greater interest than South Carolina in determining whether a dealer agreement between an 
Arkansas dealer and an out of state manufacturer can be terminated without cause."" Maj. Op. at 39. "

HS-2695-NE). "
1964,2," The Plaintiffs describe AWPs and MACs as ""prices for drugs that are established by known and unknown sources"" which are 
""published in industry trade magazines and databases."" SAC at P 31. RxHub is described by the Defendants as ""an electronic 
link that permits healthcare providers, pharmacies and PBMs to share medical information and specific identification of 
prescription. drugs for individual patients."" Defendants' Brief (doc. 28) at 3. "
1971,3," HN31[

definition, it results in ""high prices."" Id. "
1981,*," Honorable John R. Gibson, United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation."
1981,1," The code of rules that most directly influenced modern boxing was first published in 1867 under the sponsoring of John Sholto 
Douglas, Marquis of Queensberry (1844-1900), from whom they take their name. There are 12 rules in all, including ""no 
wrestling or hugging allowed,"" to ensure a fair fight between contestants. See 7 EncyclopC&dia Britannica 870 (15th ed. 2002). "
1986,2," Rule 54(b) provides in pertinent part: HN3[
] When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or 
third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more 
but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and 
upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. "
1989,3," We note that Barr appears to have changed the wording on its website, although consistent with that language the site now 
also states that ""[Barr's] generic product development activities focus on the selection of pharmaceutical products where these 
selection criteria may limit the potential number of generic competitors."" See http://www.barrlabs.com/pages/corphist.html (last 
visited June 7, 2004) (emphasis added). Since the district court did not have the benefit of this statement before it, we do not rely 
on it in reaching our decision. "
1996,4," Theorists note it usually does not further harm competition for a monopolist in one market to leverage its advantage into a 
monopoly in a downstream market. This is so because the firm already has a monopoly and can extract monopoly returns. See, 
e.g., Robert H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, 228-29, 372-75 (1978). Still, the window of monopoly opportunity is unique in this 
case. ACIC/Brantford recognized its period of exclusivity would be brief, and that the best way to take advantage of its 
exclusivity was to work with Barr to gain a monopoly in the generic warfarin sodium market. If Barr too could gain an entrenched 
advantage, ACIC/Brantford's clathrate advantage could last even after other clathrate suppliers entered that market. Therefore, 
despite allegedly possessing monopoly power, ACIC/Brantford would still have had an incentive to use that power to gain 
advantage downstream. "
2007,1," Defendant has moved for leave to file the reply brief attached to Filing No. 11. Leave is hereby granted, and the court has 
considered that reply brief in making its determinations of this motion."
2007,2," HN5[
] Concerted action between competitors at the same level of the market structure is usually termed a ""horizontal"" 
restraint, in contradistinction to combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, e.g., manufacturers and 
distributors, which are termed ""vertical"" restraints. United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 607-08, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 
S. Ct. 1126 (1972). "
2012,1," With respect to the merits, the district court noted that the Wal-Mart plaintiffs did not have an open and shut case as to liability. 
See 297 F. Supp. 2d at 511 (plaintiffs' ability to prove that the ""honor all cards"" rule was anticompetitive was ""no sure thing""). 
This was particularly true in light of the difficult questions of law involved. See 297 F. Supp. 2d at 510, quoting Hovencamp, 
Tying Arrangements and Class Actions, 36 Vand.L.Rev. 213, 213 (1983) to the effect that ""few areas of federal antitrust law are 
more confusing than the law that governs tying arrangements."" "
2013,2," The Visa and MasterCard debit cards complained of by the class plaintiffs are off-line debit cards, as opposed to on-line debit 
cards offered by other entities."
2013,3," Because of the pendency of the District of Columbia action, plaintiffs originally sought to have this action stayed to await 
developments in the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs thereafter withdrew their request for a stay. The court agrees that this case 
should proceed. There is an undoubted benefit in having Maine courts construe Maine's antitrust laws and determine what relief, 
if any, should be available to Maine consumers. "
2014,4," The specific statutory language referred to in the above-quoted citation, section 1 of the Sherman Act, is mirrored by 10 
M.R.S.A. § 1101, the provision of Maine antitrust law which plaintiffs allege Visa and MasterCard violated in this case. "
2015,5," There are some minor variations in the manner in which courts have summarized the factors set forth in Associated General 
Contractors. The above represents this court's own distillation of those factors. "
2016,6," See, e.g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. at 750 n.3 (Brennan, J, dissenting) (""If the market is relatively inelastic, he may 
pass on a relatively large portion [of any overcharge]. If demand is relatively elastic, he may not be able to raise his price and will 
have to absorb the increase, making it up by decreasing other costs or increasing sales volume. It is extremely unlikely that a 
middleman could pass on the entire cost increase. But rarely would he have to absorb the entire increase."")."
2016,7, This is a modified version of an example offered by defendants in their memorandum of law. 
2018,8," As of the writing of this decision, the court is aware that seven other state trial courts have dismissed consumer antitrust claims 
brought against Visa and MasterCard based on allegations similar to those asserted in this case. Tackitt v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., No. 
C103-740, Nebraska District Court, Lincoln County, order filed October 19, 2004; In re Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases, J.C.C.P. 
No. 4355, California Superior Court, San Francisco County; order filed October 14, 2004; Cornelison v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., Civil 
No. 03-1350, South Dakota Circuit Court, Pennington County, order filed September 29, 2004; Gutzwiller v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., No 
C4-04-58, Minnesota District Court, Clay County, order filed September 15, 2004; Beckler v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., Civil No. 09-04-C-
00030, North Dakota District Court, Cass County, opinion filed August 23, 2004; Stark v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., No. 03-055030-CZ, 
Michigan Circuit Court, Oakland County, opinion and order filed July 23, 2004; Ho v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., No. 1123166/00, New 
York Supreme Court, New York County, order filed April 26, 2004. All of the states in question, like Maine, have enacted Illinois 
Brick repealers. Some of these decisions have been based on standing, others have been based on the view that the 
consumers bringing suit did not qualify as indirect purchasers, and some have been based on both grounds. Plaintiffs have also directed the court's attention to a preliminary ruling by a trial court in New Mexico expressing the view that 
the Associated General Contractors test per se is not applicable in New Mexico but that some of the Associated General 
Contractors factors may nevertheless be relevant to standing under the New Mexico antitrust statute. Nass-Romero v. Visa 
U.S.A. Inc., No. D0101-CV-200400413, New Mexico District Court, Santa Fe County, transcript of proceedings on September 
17, 2004. The New Mexico court invited further briefing on the issue. "
2025,1," Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice of U.S Patent No. 6,037,157 (the 157 patent) and U.S. Patent No. 
5,886,036 (the036 patent). The Court takes judicial notice of the existen these patents. "
2039,1," The Connecticut Supreme Court first used the term ""cigarette rule"" in McLaughlin Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 192 Conn. 558, 
473 A.2d 1185 (Conn. 1985), to refer to a 1964 Federal Trade Commission publication listing the factors to be considered in 
determining whether a practice that is neither deceptive nor a violation of antitrust law is nevertheless unfair. See Statement of 
Basis and Purpose of Trade Regulation Rule 408, Unfair or Deceptive Advertising and Labeling of Cigarettes in Relation to the 
Health Hazards of Smoking. 29 Fed. Reg. 8324, 8355 (1964). "
2040,2," Defendants' reliance on their motion for judgment as a matter of law to preserve their inconsistency argument is unavailing. In 
support of that motion, defendants argued that a verdict in the Fabris' favor on the contract, promissory estoppel, unjust 
enrichment, or quantum meruit claims would not justify a verdict in their favor on the CUTPA claim. In order to prevail on the 
CUTPA claim, defendants argued, plaintiffs must show either aggravated conduct associated with the breach of contract or 
tortious interference, neither of which they had done. This argument is quite different from defendants' current claim that the 
jury's finding that defendants acted in good faith with respect to their contract obligations precluded the jury from also finding that 
defendants violated CUTPA. See Jarvis, 283 F.3d 33 at 61 (holding that movant must have ""clearly apprised"" the trial court of 
the error in the charge and verdict sheet and given the trial court an opportunity to correct its error). "
2041,3," We, too, have held that HN6[
] a simple breach of contract does not violate CUTPA and that the plaintiff must show 
aggravating circumstances. See Boulevard Assocs. v. Sovereign Hotels, Inc., 72 F.3d 1029, 1040 (2d Cir. 1995). That holding, 
however, does not establish that a CUTPA violation cannot occur without a breach of contract. "
2053,*," Honorable Lyle E. Strom, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation. "
2054,1," None of the appellants allege that Siemens has a monopoly over the market for PBX sales. Companies other than Siemens, 
including Lucent Technologies and Nortel, also compete with Siemens for PBX customers. Telecomm Tech. Servs. v. Siemens 
Rolm Communs., Inc., 66 F. Supp. 2d 1306, 1310 (N.D. Ga. 1998)."
2054,2," The district court believed that this case would be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court, however, 
determined that it did not have jurisdiction over this case because the patent claims were only raised as counterclaims. The case 
was then transferred back to this court. "
2055,3," The appeal here, unlike Kodak, does not involve a § 1 tying claim."
2055,4," To demonstrate that Siemens was illegally using monopoly power in the service market, the ISOs presented evidence that 
Siemens's prices for servicing were 30% to 60% higher than comparable ISO prices."
2055,5," Siemens's argument is based on a ""life-cycle"" theory of consumer buying where the consumers include present and future 
costs (such as servicing) when deciding which telecommunications system to purchase. In short, Siemens argued that 
customers considered the costs of service when making initial purchasing decisions and that this prevented Siemens from later 
charging super-competitive prices to service the PBX system. The Supreme Court rejected a similar life-cycle argument in 
Kodak I, but stated that a court needed to look at the facts of each case in evaluating whether consumers would realistically use 
life-cycle pricing when making purchasing decisions. 504 U.S. at 472-77. Here, the ISOs argue that the life-cycle theory is "
2056,," unrealistic, as it was in Kodak, because there are high initial costs to leasing a PBX system and customers are then ""locked-in"" 
to the system even if Siemens charges super-competitive prices for service."
2056,6," HN2[
] We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 373 F.3d"
2056,1132, (2004). 
2057,7," Each of these decisions adopted a different approach to dealing with the issue. In In re ISO, the Federal Circuit held that patent 
holders who unilaterally refuse to license their products are exempt from the antitrust laws unless one of three conditions exist: 
(1) the patent was obtained by fraud on the Patent Office, (2) the patent holder tied the sale of the patent to other goods or 
services, or (3) the patent holder brought sham enforcement proceedings to interfere with a competitor's business. In re ISO,

analogy between copyright and patent law. Data General, 36 F.3d at 1188-89. Finally, in Kodak II, the court purported to apply 
the Data General presumption in a patent case, but held that it is possible to rebut this presumption is through evidence of 
pretext. Kodak II, 125 F.3d at 1219. Commentators have criticized all of these approaches. In particular, the approaches of the

2058,8," Both the First and Ninth Circuits have found that a copyright owner is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that its refusal to deal 
copyrighted material is based on a legitimate business justification, and therefore not in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. 
Kodak II, 125 F.3d at 1218; Data General, 36 F.3d at 1187. The Ninth Circuit went further, finding that the presumption had been 
rebutted by ""evidence of pretext,"" and finding a Sherman Act violation. Kodak II, 125 F.2d at 1219. In the court's words, ""neither 
the aims of intellectual property law, nor the antitrust laws justify allowing a monopolist to rely upon a pretextual business 
justification to mask anticompetitive conduct."" Id. The First Circuit reached the opposite result, finding that in its case the 
presumption was not rebutted and the Sherman Act not violated. Data General, 36 F.3d at 1187-89."

2071,3," William Landes and Richard Posner, Should Indirect Purchasers Have Standing to Sue Under the Antitrust Laws? An 
Economic Analysis of the Rule of Illinois Brick, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 602, 634-35 (1979). The authors stated: Our analysis has suggested that the rule of Illinois Brick, which bars indirect purchasers from bringing private antitrust 
damage actions, is probably the soundest rule from the standpoint of maximizing the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement. 
 [**19] We anticipate the argument that, however abstractly desirable it may seem to confine enforcement to direct 
purchasers, to do so is to alter the fundamental character of the private antitrust action in a way that cannot be squared with 
the intent of Congress in creating private damage remedies for antitrust violations. One way of characterizing our position is 
that it allows someone who may not be injured (or not injured much) -- the direct purchaser -- to recover (treble) damages 
while denying the right to recover any damages to other people -- indirect purchasers-who may in fact be injured. There is 
an element of paradox in this result, but it is dispelled by careful analysis. As we have shown, even if indirect purchasers 
were given the nominal right to sue, they would often fail to receive significant compensation. And anyone troubled by the 
windfall element in the judgment received by the direct purchaser must in logic reexamine the entire structure of private 
antitrust enforcement. Two-thirds of every private antitrust damage judgment (the punitive component of the judgment) is a 
windfall to the purchaser. In a class action, much of even the compensatory portion of the judgment  [**20] may end up in 
the pockets of lawyers or in state treasuries, rather than in the pockets of the people who were actually harmed by the 
antitrust violation. The windfall element cannot be purged by the private antitrust suit without a complete reworking of 
antitrust enforcement. Until that is done, society will be well-advised to allow some direct purchasers to enjoy windfalls if, as 
we have argued, the direct purchaser suit is on balance a more effective instrument for enforcing the antitrust rule 
prohibiting price fixing than the indirect-purchaser suit. Id. (footnote omitted). "

with federal antitrust laws."" 123 N.C. App. at 581, 473 S.E.2d at 686."
2077,13, See discussion infra Part V.B (describing the indirect purchaser litigation since Hyde was decided).
2077,14," The Hyde court specifically found that there were no complex damage or proof issues before it and further held that there was 
nothing in the record  [**40] in that case to establish that other cases would pose difficult damage and administrative issues. The 
Hyde court said: It is clear that a suit by indirect purchasers under our antitrust laws will be complex. However, when asked at oral argument 
whether ""chaos reigned"" in states which have allowed indirect purchaser suits, defendants were unable to cite a single 
example. This failure to cite a single indirect purchaser case in which a court has been faced with an impossible complex 
situation counsels us that a fear of complexity is not a sufficient reason to disallow a suit by an indirect purchaser."
2077,123," N.C. App. at 584, 473 S.E.2d at 687-88. The facts in Hyde presented a fairly simple case. The product was a commodity which was not altered or incorporated in another 
product in the distribution chain, and the price fixing took place at the wholesale level, only one level removed from the 
consumer. Direct impact on the consumer and pass through were not difficult issues to prove. The question of whether the fixed 
price was absorbed by the consumer was not difficult. The complexity presented by Morris and Crouch differs dramatically from 
Hyde."
2077,15," The Hyde court found: ""However, there are few,  [**41] if any, reported instances of a defendant paying treble damages to two 
different classes of purchasers based on a single antitrust violation."" 123 N.C. App. at 583, 473 S.E.2d at 687. In Crouch, 
plaintiffs seek to recover the same damages for which direct purchasers such as tire companies may seek treble damages. In 
Morris, defendants have already agreed to a multibillion dollar settlement with the direct purchaser class. In Bruggers, the class 
recovered for the same offenses which were the subject of federal direct purchaser actions. Likewise, in Microsoft, the plaintiffs 
recovered on the same claims which were asserted by direct purchasers. The problems recognized with possible double 
recovery are obvious. "

pres settlement that provided no benefit to the class. Bruggers resulted in a settlement that went to class members under a 
cumbersome administrative process which did not likely reach anything more than a small minority of the class. Microsoft 
 [**42] is a classic example of the complex administrative problems that can be created. It will likely result in primarily a cy pres 
settlement. All of these cases fit the forecast of difficulties made by Landes and Posner in their article. See supra note 3. "

recover damages, Plaintiff would first need to prove that as a result of Defendants' alleged restraint of trade in providing 
debit card services to that K-Mart store, K-Mart paid excessive debit fees. Plaintiff would then need to prove that K-Mart did 
not absorb any such excess debit fees by making less profit, or in some other non-monetary way, such as by hiring fewer 
employees and/or not making major repairs to its building, but instead passed on the excess debit fees in the price of the 
items sold to consumers. Plaintiff would then need to prove that some identifiable portion of the item was not attributable to 
any factors which might affect the price of that item on that specific date. Plaintiff would then need to make the same offer 
of proof for any item sold by the K-Mart store not only on March 1, 2003, but for  [**86] every other day in issue, and would 
have to make the same offer of proof relative to every other merchant involved in his claim. Id. at 16."
