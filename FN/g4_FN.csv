was Judge Malmstadt's substitute that day. "
27,2," From what counsel indicated at the status conference I held on May 4 and as discussed in Univision's brief on the remand 
motion -- and from what is plainly visible on Milwaukee area cable itself -- Channel 46's signal presently is rebroadcast on cable. 
Thus, cable watchers currently may view Univision programming as part of their cable packages."
27,3," Wisconsin Statute ยง 133.02(3) reads: Every person who monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, or combines or conspires with any other person or persons to 
monopolize any part of trade or commerce may be fined not more than $ 100,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, 
may be fined not more than $ 50,000 or imprisoned for not more than 7 years and 6 months or both."
27,4," Section 2 states: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other 
person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court. "
28,5," While I have set forth the elements of only the monopolization claim, the requirements of anticompetitive conduct and antitrust 
injury apply to plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim as well. See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 122 
L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993) (attempted monopolization requires (1) predatory or anticompetitive conduct, (2) specific 
intent to monopolize, and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power); Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. Western 
Union Tel. Co., 797 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Conduct lawful for a monopolist is lawful for a firm attempting to become a 
monopolist.""). Therefore, if the monopolization claim fails on these points, the attempt claim fails too. "
35,6," There are no allegations or suggestions in the record that Telemundo is even interested in the relevant market or that it is a real 
competitor of Univision's in the sense of offering a similar product."
35,7," A facility is essential if it is necessary for access to the relevant market and a competitor cannot practically or reasonably 
duplicate it.  MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1132-33 (7th Cir. 1983). Examples are electrical 
transmission lines, see Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973), and the 
only railroad terminals in town, see United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 S. Ct. 507 (1912). 
Antitrust laws have imposed on firms controlling an essential facility the obligation to make the facility available to competitors on 
nondiscriminatory terms.  MCI, 708 F.2d at 1132. "
36,8," While plaintiff made some vague references at oral argument about a lack of space on the cable network for a second Spanish-
language channel, there are absolutely no allegations in the complaint asserting that fact or that Univision has forced the cable 
provider, as controller of a possibly essential facility, to sign an exclusivity agreement."
36,9," Plaintiffs suggested at oral argument that the viewers left behind after Univision's switch to cable will be those at the low-end of 
the economic scale who cannot afford cable, and they will be unattractive to Telemundo or any other competitor. No such 
allegation is made in the complaint, however, which focuses on numbers. "
41,1," The term ""Pepsi"", as used in this opinion, shall refer generically to the entire Pepsi Cola Company system including its product 
bottlers and distributors. Similarly, the term ""Coke"" shall reference the entire Coca Cola Company system including the bottlers 
and distributors of Coke products."
41,2," See note 1, supra."
41,3," Though identified as a bottler, Louisa Coke no longer does any actual bottling. Rather, it simply serves as a distributor. While it 
holds the exclusive distribution rights for all Coke products in its franchise territory, it does not provide fountain syrup services or 
carry the complete line of Coke products such as Nestea, Fruitopia and the like. Britton complains that it would not be profitable 
to provide these other services because of Pepsi's market dominance. Though Britton has not made his ability to market these 
other services an issue in his case, Pepsi-Metro has raised the matter to suggest that Louisa Coke suffers in its market from its 
own refusal to compete on a broad scale. "
42,4," Specifically, Louisa Coke's territory covers Lawrence, Johnson, Martin, and Floyd Counties in Kentucky, as well as Wayne, 
Mingo and Lincoln Counties in West Virginia. "
44,5," Interestingly, Britton put none of that $ 400,000 into Louisa Coke. Rather, he divided this money amongst his family."
44,6, A copy of that letter is not in the record but Coke USA's response referencing this letter is. 
46,7," KRS 446.040 provides that ""[a] person injured by the violation of any statute may recover from the offender such damages as 
he sustained by reason of the violation, although a penalty or forfeiture is imposed for such violation."" "
47,8," Count VII specifically asserts violations of KRS 365.050 and relief for such through KRS 365.070. Count XI alleges that the 
same conduct also violated W.Va. law though no specific statute is mentioned. Plaintiff demands relief through W.Va.Code 47-
11a-9 but is apparently asserting a violation of W.Va.Code ยง 47-11a-3."
47,9," Plaintiff also presented affidavits from its drivers who claim various retail personnel told them they had received cash payments 
from Pepsi-Metro. Plaintiff did not produce any affidavits or testimony from these retailers. Those statements, as presented to 
the Court, are hearsay. Since Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) requires that supporting affidavits be based on personal knowledge and set 
forth facts as would be admissible in evidence, the Court shall not consider these drivers' affidavits to the extent they offer 
inadmissible hearsay evidence."
47,10," Plaintiff also presented an affidavit from Junior Curtis, the manager of a Foodland Grocery Store in Louisa, Kentucky, who 
states that Pepsi paid Foodland a ""special fee"" for more shelf space. Curtis does not say when this occurred or how he knows 
this to be true. Contrary to Plaintiff's original allegations, Curtis does not say Pepsi paid him personally anything or that he 
witnessed such a transaction with anyone else. Indeed, the owner of that same Foodland denies receiving any such fee. 
Because the Court cannot determine whether Curtis' statements are based on personal knowledge or hearsay, the Court cannot "
48,," find this statement meets the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 either. Consequently, the Court shall not consider the same for 
purposes of this motion. "
49,11," Affidavits from 15 large, important customers indicate that they denied Coke more shelf space because they could not count 
on having enough Coke products to sell. They say they often ran out of Coke products because Louisa Coke did not keep its 
shelves fully stocked and was slow to respond, if it responded at all, to their requests for additional products. While Pepsi drivers 
made deliveries several times a day including weekends, stocked the shelves themselves and set up their own displays and 
advertising, Louisa Coke only came once or twice a week, often left the products on the floor, and never brought any signs or "
50,," advertising. At least one customer reported that he ejected a Coke driver from his store because the driver's appearance was 
""nasty, unpresentable and repulsive to customers"". Another customer banned Louisa Coke from its store for some time after a 
Coke driver punched the manager in the face. "
55,1," Plaintiffs denominate their complaint as a class action. However, neither party has sought certification of the class. Since class 
certification has not been promptly sought by either plaintiffs or defendant, class certification will be denied. See Mira v. Nuclear 
Measurements Corp., 107 F.3d 466, 474-75 (7th Cir. 1997) (class certification should be decided early in a case before any 
rulings on dispositive motions). The class allegations are dismissed without prejudice because the parties have failed to promptly 
pursue certification. See Anderson v. Cornejo, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 519, 1999 WL 35307, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 11, 1999). "

located in a State, the public authority (including the State transportation department), having jurisdiction over the highway, 
bridge, or tunnel must enter into an agreement with the Secretary which provides that all toll revenues received from 
operation of the toll facility will be used first for debt service, for reasonable return on investment of any private person 
financing the project, and for the costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the toll facility, including 
reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. If the State certifies annually that the tolled facility is being 
adequately maintained, the State may use any toll revenues in excess amounts required under the preceding sentence for 
any purpose for which Federal funds may be obligated by a State under this title. "

several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and on conviction 
thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or if any other person, $ 350,000, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments at the discretion of the court. "

the discretion of the court."
60,7," Judicial notes may be taken of geographical locations, including the locations of streets and highways. See Deutch v. United 
States, 367 U.S. 456, 470, 6 L. Ed. 2d 963, 81 S. Ct. 1587 (1961); Lowrance v. Pflueger, 878 F.2d 1014, 1018 (7th Cir. 1989); 
State v. Seigel, 163 Wis. 2d 871, 472 N.W.2d 584, 591 n.15 (1991). "
61,8," The parties disagree as to whether the fees charged Skyway users are properly categorized as tolls or as taxes. However 
plaintiffs' complaint repeatedly characterizes the fees as ""tolls."" "
62,9," Plaintiffs are parties to a prior state court action filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, No. 98 CH 2012. "
70,1," The Baltimore Sun was also named as a defendant, but pursuant to a joint motion of The Sun and AD/SAT, the District Court 
dismissed AD/SAT's claims against The Sun with prejudice in May 1995."
70,2," Under the rate card effective from August 1991 to 1994, the fee for an advertiser sending a single ad to a single paper on the 
same day was $ 90. The lowest price per transmission was $ 11.70, which applied if the advertiser sent the ad to 76 or more 
newspapers. In its last years of operation, however, AD/SAT often negotiated special rates for its larger customers. "
78,3," AD/SAT's claim of overcharging is very similar to an ""essential facilities"" antitrust claim. Thus, it is relevant to note that an 
""essential facilities"" plaintiff must raise a triable issue of fact with respect to whether it is economically infeasible for the facility to 
be duplicated, and whether the denial of use inflicts a severe handicap. See Twin Laboratories, 900 F.2d at 568-69. Assuming 
that overcharging for the use of a facility is tantamount to denial of use, AD/SAT's claim nevertheless would fail because it has 
not raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether it was overcharged so as to be effectively denied use or at 
least severely handicapped. "
85,4," In addition, summary judgment in favor of Advance was warranted since AD/SAT made no specific allegations against this 
defendant other than those levied against its president, Newhouse, and the newspaper publishing companies that it owns. "
88,*, The opinion was originally issued in typescript. 
94,1," This conclusion moots B.F. Goodrich's contention that the preliminary injunction on the contract claim should last only as long 
as it takes to convene an arbitral panel. The need to preserve the status quo prior to a trial on the merits of the antitrust claim 
provides a sufficient basis for the duration of the preliminary injunction. "
95,2," In supplemental filings, the parties have made us aware of the ongoing arbitration of the contract claim. Since we rely solely on 
the antitrust claim to sustain the preliminary injunction, we have no need to consider what effect these ongoing proceedings 
might have on our view of the likelihood of success on the merits of the contract claim."
95,3," The HHI estimates market concentration by summing the squares of the market shares of every firm in the market. Areeda, 
Hovenkamp, & Solow, Antitrust Law, P 930(a) (rev. ed. 1998). Federal antitrust regulators define as ""highly concentrated"" any 
market in which the HHI exceed 1800, and presume that mergers in that range ""producing an increase in the HHI of more than "

97,4," Since we have determined that AlliedSignal has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of establishing standing as a consumer of 
landing gear, we do not reach AlliedSignal's alternative ground of antitrust standing based on the injury AlliedSignal would 
endure if B.F. Goodrich-Coltec were able to use its dominant position in landing gear to leverage its own wheel and brakes 
division unfairly over that of AlliedSignal. We similarly do not address the Crane Plaintiffs' injury based on B.F. Goodrich-Coltec's 
alleged monopoly buying power as it has not been made the subject of this appeal. "

or persons operating railroads in this State to enter into any agreement among themselves, directly or indirectly, for the 
division among themselves of the freight carrying business at any station, town or city in this State, or into any pool 
arrangement among themselves of the nature and character aforesaid, the object, purpose and effect of which in either 
event shall be to prevent free and fair competition among said railroad companies or persons operating said railroads, for 
said freight carrying business, and to establish extortionate rates in favor of said companies or persons in doing said 
business, and which shall have the effect of being in undue restraint of the trade and business at any such station, town or 
city of this State. ""Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That any officer, agent or servant of any such company, or person operating any railroad in 
this State who shall violate any of the provisions of this act, or who shall aid or assist in making or carrying out or 
performing any such agreement or pool arrangement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction for every such

same. ""Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That it is the true intent and meaning of this act, that any such agreement, rates or pool 
agreement made by any convention or association of freight agents, or commissioner of freight rates or rate making 
committee outside of this State, but to be performed in whole or in part in this State, shall as to such part of the same, as is

122,3," United States v. E.C. Knight Co. was the Supreme Court's first decision construing the Sherman Antitrust Act. The full text in 
which this quotation appears is as follows: ""It cannot be denied that the power of a State to protect the lives, health, and property of its citizens, and to preserve good 
order and the public morals, 'the power to govern men and things within the limits of its dominion,' is a power originally and 
always belonging to the States, not surrendered by them to the general government, nor directly restrained by the 
Constitution of the United States, and essentially exclusive. The relief of the citizens of each State from the burden of 
monopoly and the evils resulting from the restraint of trade among such citizens was left with the States to deal with, and 
this court has recognized their possession of that power even to the extent of holding that an employment or business 
carried on by private individuals, when it becomes a matter of such public interest and importance as to create a common 
charge or burden upon the citizen; in other words, when it becomes a practical monopoly, to which the citizen is compelled 
to resort and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the community, is subject to regulation by state legislative 
power. On the other hand, the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States is also exclusive. The 
Constitution does not provide that interstate commerce shall be free, but, by the grant of this exclusive power to regulate it, 
it was left free except as Congress might impose restraints. Therefore it has been determined that the failure of Congress to 
exercise this exclusive power in any case is an expression of its will that the subject shall be free from restrictions or 
impositions upon it by the several States, and if a law passed by a State in the exercise of its acknowledged powers comes 
into conflict with that will, the Congress and the State cannot occupy the position of equal opposing sovereignties, because 
the Constitution declares its supremacy and that of the laws passed in pursuance thereof; and that which is not supreme 
must yield to that which is supreme. 'Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic,' said Chief Justice Marshall, 'but it is something 
more; it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and 
is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.' That which belongs to commerce is within the jurisdiction 
of the United States, but that which does not belong to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the police power of the State.

122,156," U.S. at 11-12. In P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law, An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and their Application, ยง 232c (1978), we find the 
following discussion of Knight: ""The 1895 Knight case, the Supreme Court's first Sherman Act decision, held a national monopoly of sugar manufacturing 
beyond the constitutional reach of the act because mere manufacturing was not 'commerce.' At that time, the Commerce "
123,," Clause embraced only the actual and 'direct' purchase, sale, or transportation of goods across state lines. The Court 
acknowledged that such commerce was affected by the sugar monopoly, but only 'indirectly.' ""Two characteristics of the Knight decision remain important today. First, the Court never reached the merits of the 
government's case because the constitutional determination was made first, and the courts still treat the commerce 
question as a preliminary jurisdictional hurdle in antitrust litigation. Second, the jurisdictional inquiry was entirely 
independent of the Sherman Act's purposes. That separation seemed feasible in 1895 when 'interstate commerce' was 
wholly dependent upon the location of the defendant's conduct, and without regard to its impact on the interests protected 
by the Sherman Act. This neat separation of jurisdictional and substantive inquiries caused difficulties with later and more 
expansive definitions of interstate commerce."""
123,4," We note that the Supreme Court had held at the time Alabama first enacted its antitrust statutes that the Commerce Clause, in 
conferring on Congress the power to regulate commerce, did not wholly withdraw from the states the power to regulate matters 
of local concern with respect to which Congress had not exercised its power, even though the regulation in some way affected 
interstate commerce. See, e.g., California v. Thompson, 313 U.S. 109, 113, 85 L. Ed. 1219, 61 S. Ct. 930 (1941), in which the 
Court noted: ""Ever since Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 [(1829)], and Cooley v. [Board of Wardens of the Port of 
Philadelphia], 53 U.S. 299, 12 How. 299, 13 L. Ed. 996 [(1851)], it has been recognized that there are matters of local 
concern, the regulation of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce, but which because of their 
local character and their number and diversity may never be adequately dealt with by Congress. Because of their local 
character, also, there is wide scope for local regulation without impairing the uniformity of control of the national commerce 
in matters of national concern and without materially obstructing the free flow of commerce which were the principal objects 
sought to be secured by the Commerce Clause. Notwithstanding the Commerce Clause, such regulation in the absence of 
Congressional action has, for the most part, been left to the states by the decisions of this Court, subject only to other 
applicable constitutional restraints."" See, also, South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303 U.S. 177, 82 L. Ed. 734, 58 S. Ct. 510 
(1938); Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U.S. 539, 61 L. Ed. 480, 37 S. Ct. 217 (1917); Bowman v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., supra, and 
the cases cited therein. There is nothing, however, in the Supreme Court's decisions in United States v. E.C. Knight Co., supra, 
and Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, supra, that indicates that the Court would have viewed extraterritorial state 
antitrust provisions as falling within that constitutionally permissible category of local regulation having only an indirect or 
incidental effect on interstate commerce. "
127,5," The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's order denying the motion to remand. In doing so, the 
court recognized that at the turn of the century the Alabama Legislature lacked the constitutional authority to regulate interstate 
commerce through the use of antitrust provisions: ""The cases on which the defendants rely, for example, Georgia Fruit Exchange v. Turnipseed, 9 Ala. App. 123, 62 So. 542, 
546 (1913), date from a period in which, interstate commerce being narrowly defined, see, e.g., Hadley Dean Plate Glass 
Co. v. Highland Glass Co., 143 F. 242, 244 (8th Cir. 1906), and federal power to regulate such commerce being deemed "
128,," exclusive, id.; United States v. E.C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 11, 15 S. Ct. 249, 253, 39 L. Ed. 325 (1895), a state statute 
limited to intrastate commerce would have some, albeit a strictly limited, scope and could not have a greater scope no 
matter how much the state wanted it to."""
128,123," F.3d at 612-13. The court then went on to reason that ""the cases thus were not interpreting the statute; they were 
interpreting the Constitution as placing upper and lower bounds on the reach of the statute."" 123 F.3d at 613. Stating that the 
United States Constitution ""has since been reinterpreted,"" the court noted that ""other states [have] read their antitrust statutes to 
reach what is now understood to be interstate commerce,"" and that ""we are given no reason to suppose that Alabama would 
buck this trend."" Id. This Court's decisions in Siegelman v. Chase Manhattan Bank, supra; Ex parte Dixie Tool & Die Co., supra; 
and Ex parte Louisville & N.R.R., supra, which created a presumption that the Legislature did not intend to exceed its 
constitutional authority in enacting this state's antitrust provisions, preclude the kind of statutory construction that the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals thought we might engage in. As we have explained, this presumption was strengthened by, among 
other things, the extensive legislative history of the Alabama statutes that we have set out, including the critical limiting words 
contained in Act No. 202 -- ""within this state."" The Seventh Circuit apparently ruled without the benefit of this legislative history or 
this Court's decisions referenced above. We also note that the Seventh Circuit expressed concern that ""if the statute is limited

letter because there are virtually no sales, in Alabama or anywhere else in the United States, that are intrastate in that sense.""

158,3," United States v. E.C. Knight Co. was the Supreme Court's first decision construing the Sherman Antitrust Act. The full text in 
which this quotation appears is as follows: ""It cannot be denied that the power of a State to protect the lives, health, and property of its citizens, and to preserve good 
order and the public morals, 'the power to govern men and things within the limits of its dominion,' is a power originally and 
always belonging to the States, not surrendered by them to the general government, nor directly restrained by the 
Constitution of the United States, and essentially exclusive. The relief of the citizens of each State from the burden of 
monopoly and the evils resulting from the restraint of trade among such citizens was left with the States to deal with, and 
this court has recognized their possession of that power even to the extent of holding that an employment or business 
carried on by private individuals, when it becomes a matter of such public interest and importance as to create a common 
charge or burden upon the citizen; in other words, when it becomes a practical monopoly, to which the citizen is compelled 
to resort and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the community, is subject to regulation by state legislative 
power. On the other hand, the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States is also exclusive. The 
Constitution does not provide that interstate commerce shall be free, but, by the grant of this exclusive power to regulate it, 
it was left free except as Congress might impose restraints. Therefore it has been determined that the failure of Congress to 
exercise this exclusive power in any case is an expression of its will that the subject shall be free from restrictions or 
impositions upon it by the several States, and if a law passed by a State in the exercise of its acknowledged powers comes 
into conflict with that will, the Congress and the State cannot occupy the position of equal opposing sovereignties, because 
the Constitution declares its supremacy and that of the laws passed in pursuance thereof; and that which is not supreme 
must yield to that which is supreme. 'Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic,' said Chief Justice Marshall, 'but it is something 
more; it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and 
is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.' That which belongs to commerce is within the jurisdiction 
of the United States, but that which does not belong to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the police power of the State.

158,156," U.S. at 11-12. In P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law, An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and their Application, ยง 232c (1978), we find the 
following discussion of Knight: ""The 1895 Knight case, the Supreme Court's first Sherman Act decision, held a national monopoly of sugar manufacturing 
beyond the constitutional reach of the act because mere manufacturing was not 'commerce.' At that time, the Commerce 
Clause embraced only the actual and 'direct' purchase, sale, or transportation of goods across state lines. The Court 
acknowledged that such commerce was affected by the sugar monopoly, but only 'indirectly.' ""Two characteristics of the Knight decision remain important today. First, the Court never reached the merits of the 
government's case because the constitutional determination was made first, and the courts still treat the commerce 
question as a preliminary jurisdictional hurdle in antitrust litigation. Second, the jurisdictional inquiry was entirely 
independent of the Sherman Act's purposes. That separation seemed feasible in 1895 when 'interstate commerce' was 
wholly dependent upon the location of the defendant's conduct, and without regard to its impact on the interests protected 
by the Sherman Act. This neat separation of jurisdictional and substantive inquiries caused difficulties with later and more 
expansive definitions of interstate commerce."" "
159,4," We note that the Supreme Court had held at the time Alabama first enacted its antitrust statutes that the Commerce Clause, in 
conferring on Congress the power to regulate commerce, did not wholly withdraw from the states the power to regulate matters 
of local concern with respect to which Congress had not exercised its power, even though the regulation in some way affected 
interstate commerce. See, e.g., California v. Thompson, 313 U.S. 109, 113, 85 L. Ed. 1219, 61 S. Ct. 930 (1941), in which the 
Court noted: ""Ever since Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 [(1829)], and Cooley v. [Board of Wardens of the Port of 
Philadelphia], 53 U.S. 299, 12 How. 299, 13 L. Ed. 996 [(1851)], it has been recognized that there are matters of local 
concern, the regulation of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce, but which because of their 
local character and their number and diversity may never be adequately dealt with by Congress. Because of their local 
character, also, there is wide scope for local regulation without impairing the uniformity of control of the national commerce 
in matters of national concern and without materially obstructing the free flow of commerce which were the principal objects 
sought to be secured by the Commerce Clause. Notwithstanding the Commerce Clause, such regulation in the absence of 
Congressional action has, for the most part, been left to the states by the decisions of this Court, subject only to other 
applicable constitutional restraints."" See, also, South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303 U.S. 177, 82 L. Ed. 734, 58 S. Ct. 510 
(1938); Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U.S. 539, 61 L. Ed. 480, 37 S. Ct. 217 (1917); Bowman v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., supra, and 
the cases cited therein. There is nothing, however, in the Supreme Court's decisions in United States v. E.C. Knight Co., supra, 
and Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, supra, that indicates that the Court would have viewed extraterritorial state 
antitrust provisions as falling within that constitutionally permissible category of local regulation having only an indirect or 
incidental effect on interstate commerce. "
163,5," The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's order denying the motion to remand. In doing so, the 
court recognized that at the turn of the century the Alabama Legislature lacked the constitutional authority to regulate interstate 
commerce through the use of antitrust provisions: ""The cases on which the defendants rely, for example, Georgia Fruit Exchange v. Turnipseed, 9 Ala. App. 123, 62 So. 542, 
546 (1913), date from a period in which, interstate commerce being narrowly defined, see, e.g., Hadley Dean Plate Glass 
Co. v. Highland Glass Co., 143 F. 242, 244 (8th Cir. 1906), and federal power to regulate such commerce being deemed 
exclusive, id.; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 11, 15 S. Ct. 249, 253, 39 L. Ed. 325 (1895), a state statute 
limited to intrastate commerce would have some, albeit a strictly limited, scope and could not have a greater scope no 
matter how much the state wanted it to."""
163,123," F.3d at 612-13. The court then went on to reason that ""the cases thus were not interpreting the statute; they were 
interpreting the Constitution as placing upper and lower bounds on the reach of the statute."" 123 F.3d at 613. Stating that the 
United States Constitution ""has since been reinterpreted,"" the court noted that ""other states [have] read their antitrust statutes to 
reach what is now understood to be interstate commerce,"" and that ""we are given no reason to suppose that Alabama would 
buck this trend."" Id. This Court's decisions in Siegelman v. Chase Manhattan Bank, supra; Ex parte Dixie Tool & Die Co., supra; 
and Ex parte Louisville & N.R.R., supra, which created a presumption that the Legislature did not intend to exceed its 
constitutional authority in enacting this state's antitrust provisions, preclude the kind of statutory construction that the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals thought we might engage in. As we have explained, this presumption was strengthened by, among "
164,," other things, the extensive legislative history of the Alabama statutes that we have set out, including the critical limiting words 
contained in Act No. 202 -- ""within this state."" The Seventh Circuit apparently ruled without the benefit of this legislative history or 
this Court's decisions referenced above. We also note that the Seventh Circuit expressed concern that ""if the statute is limited 
today as it once was to commerce that is not within the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause, it is a dead 
letter because there are virtually no sales, in Alabama or anywhere else in the United States, that are intrastate in that sense."" 
123 F.3d at 613. However, the statutes, as we interpret them, may yet have a field of operation because they continue to reach 
transactions within this state, in the geographic sense, even though such transactions may affect interstate commerce as 
currently defined by federal law. See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 633, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976) 
(Stewart, J., dissenting) (recognizing that when Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, state efforts to restrain monopolies 
were ""restricted to the geographic boundaries of the several states""). "
165,6," Of course, Alabama's antitrust statutes may not be applied in a manner that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate 
commerce. See Minnesota v. Cloverleaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, 101 S. Ct. 715 (1981); Hunt v. 
Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383, 97 S. Ct. 2434 (1977). "
166,7," Because this case presents the same issues as Abbott Laboratories v. Durrett (No. 1960464), another case presently pending 
before this Court, I have also taken into account the effect the result of that case will have on Mr. Childs's interest in Walston 
Wells. I note that the plaintiffs in Durrett argue that my recusal decision should also take into account other cases not presently 
before this Court in which, they assert, Walston Wells is involved and which, they assert, may be affected by the outcome of this 
case. ""Where a party seeks to create an artificial appearance of bias, โฆ recusal will generally not be required, because the duty 
of the judge to decide that case outweighs the appearance of partiality."" Dunlop Tire Corp. v. Allen, 725 So. 2d 960, 977 (Ala. 
1998) (See, J., statement of nonrecusal) (discussing whether a lawyer's threat to file a separate lawsuit against the judge 
creates an appearance of partiality). ""To hold otherwise would allow a litigant to control judicial proceedings whenever a litigant 
becomes dissatisfied with the course of the proceedings."" Id. A party cannot be permitted to ""judge-shop"" by seeking out 
information unknown to the judge, and then disclosing that information to the judge in order thereby to create an appearance of 
bias that will allow the party selectively to disqualify a judge the party believes will decide a case in a particular way. I will not 
recuse myself based on those cases not before this Court. "
167,8," Seven Up also maintains that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned by members of the public because I failed ""to 
expressly disclose the existence of [my] relationship [to Mr. Childs] to Seven Up โฆ."" Seven Up cites an advisory opinion of the 
Judicial Inquiry Commission (""JIC"") that states: ""In all โฆ cases in which a party is represented by a member of a law firm of which the judge's sister-in-law is a partner, the 
judge should disclose the existence of the relationship to the parties and their attorneys. The general rule is that 'it is the 
judge's obligation to disclose all possibly disqualifying facts.'"" Ala. Jud. Inquiry Comm'n Adv. Op. 97-653 (June 27, 1997) (quoting J. Shaman et al., Judicial Conduct and Ethics, ยง 5.26 
(1990)). First, I have disclosed ""Larry B. Childs, Esq., of Walston, Wells, Anderson & Bains--Birmingham"" continuously on my recusal list, 
filed with the Supreme Court clerk's office, since February 5, 1997, shortly after I assumed my position on this Court. Second, 
Canon 3D, which the JIC was interpreting, does not require disclosure in every instance in which the law firm of a lawyer relative 
is before the judge. Rather, it is the purpose of Canon 3D to permit a judge who is already disqualified by the terms of Canon 
3C(1)(c) or Canon 3C(1)(d) to avoid withdrawing from the proceedings, through disclosure and consent of the parties and their 
attorneys. Cannon 3D provides: ""A judge disqualified by the terms of Canon 3C(1)(c) or Canon 3C(1)(d) may, instead of withdrawing from the proceeding, 
disclose in the record the basis of his disqualification. If based on such disclosure, the parties and lawyers, independently of 
the judge's participation, all agree in writing that the judge's relationship is immaterial or that his financial interest is 
insubstantial, the judge is no longer disqualified, and may participate in the proceeding. The agreement signed by all parties 
and lawyers shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding."" Accordingly, the disclosure requirement imposed by the Canons of Judicial Ethics and discussed in the JIC opinion would not be 
effective until and unless the circumstances of the case otherwise required my recusal."

170,13," Flamm continues, pointing out that there is authority to the contrary: ""[A] number of courts and commentators have concluded that when the judge's relative is a partner in a firm appearing in a 
matter presently pending before him, judicial disqualification is mandated, but disqualification of the judge is not necessarily 
mandated when the judge's relative is merely an associate."" Richard E. Flamm, Judicial Disqualification: Recusal and Disqualification of Judges, ยง 8.5.5 (1996). He also notes: ""While judicial disqualification is sometimes sought on the ground that a party to a proceeding is a client of a judge-
relative's firm, it is ordinarily insufficient to establish merely that the party is just any client; rather, it may be necessary to 
show that the client is a 'material' client. The loss of a nonmaterial client--by definition--would not 'substantially affect' most 
law firms and, hence, would not substantially affect the interest of the judge's attorney-relative."" Id. at ยง 8.5.6."
170,14," The statute quoted, 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(b)(5) (1976), requires that any justice, judge, magistrate, or referee ""shall โฆ disqualify 
himself โฆ [where] he or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a 
person: ""(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; ""(ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; ""(iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; ""(iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding."""
170,15," The Second Circuit also noted that the judge ""[took] judicial notice of those matters that add to the reputation of major law firms in the City of New York and concluded 
that insofar as the reputation of [the relative's law firm] is concerned, this matter is not of that significance to either add [to] 
or detract from its reputation in the City of New York โฆ."" "
171,," Pashaian, 88 F.3d at 84."
171,16," The United States Court of Appeals for the old Fifth Circuit required recusal when a judge's relative was a partner in a law firm 
involved in a case pending before the judge. That court stated: ""We hold that when a partner in a law firm is related to a judge within the third degree, that partner will always be 'known by 
the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome' of a proceeding involving the partner's law 
firm."" Potashnick v. Port City Constr. Co., 609 F.2d 1101, 1113 (5th Cir. 1980) (basing its decision on 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(b)(5)(iii), which 
is identical to Canon 3C(1)(d)(ii), Ala. Can. Jud. Eth.). On the other hand, the present Fifth Circuit has refused to apply this rationale to a claim that, because the judge's husband was 
a partner in a law firm that had represented a party on numerous occasions, the judge's impartiality was called into question.  In 
re Billedeaux, 972 F.2d 104, 105-06 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding the interest to be ""too remote and speculative to support or suggest 
recusal""). In Billedeaux, the relative's law firm was not involved in the case then before the judge. The argument for recusal was 
that the law firm represented one of the parties before the judge on an ongoing basis and was receiving fees from those 
representations at the time the case was before the judge. Id. The Second Circuit specifically rejected the rule of automatic recusal as set forth in Potashnick.  Pashaian v. Eccelston 
Properties, Ltd., 88 F.3d 77 (2d Cir. 1996)."
171,17," Finally, I note that although the United States Supreme Court has not issued an opinion resolving the conflict between the 
rationales of the Second and Fifth Circuits, seven Justices of that Court released a ""Statement of Recusal Policy"" on November 
1, 1993. In that statement, the seven Justices set forth personal recusal policies that they would follow in certain circumstances. 
The Justices stated: ""A relative's partnership status, or participation in earlier stages of the litigation, is relevant โฆ only under one of two less 
specific provisions of ยง 455, which require recusal when the judge knows that the relative has 'an interest that could be 
substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding,' [28 U.S.C.] ยง 455(b)(5)(iii), or when for any reason the judge's 
'impartiality might reasonably be questioned,' ยง 455(a). We think that a relative's partnership in the firm appearing before 
us, or his or her previous work as a lawyer on a case that later comes before us, does not automatically trigger these 
provisions. If that were the intent of the law, the per se 'lawyer-related recusal' requirement of ยง 455(b)(5)(ii) would have 
expressed it. Per se recusal for a relative's membership in the partnership appearing here, or for a relative's work on the 
case below, would render the limitation of ยง 455(b)(5)(ii) to personal work, and to present representation, meaningless."" ""Statement of Recusal Policy,"" Supreme Court of the United States, November 1, 1993 (emphasis in original). Although the 
Justices are not automatically recused, they stated that they would personally recuse themselves from cases involving a law firm 
in which a relative is a partner who shares profits. The Justices explained: ""It seems to us that in virtually every case before us with retained counsel there exists a genuine possibility that success or 
failure will affect the amount of the fee, and hence a genuine possibility that the outcome will have a substantial effect upon 
each partner's compensation. Since it is impractical to assure ourselves of the absence of such consequences in each 
individual case, we shall recuse ourselves from all cases in which appearances on behalf of parties are made by firms in "
172,," which our relatives are partners, unless we have received from the firm written assurance that income from Supreme Court 
litigation is, on a permanent basis, excluded from our relatives' partnership shares."" Id. Thus, although the seven Justices rejected a per se recusal policy like that set forth in Potashnick, 609 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 
1980), they decided, in the interest of practicality, that they would recuse themselves from all such cases unless they ""received 
from the firm written assurance that income from Supreme Court litigation is, on a permanent basis, excluded from [their] 
relatives' partnership shares."" ""Statement of Recusal Policy,"" supra."
172,18," It may also be that there is a difference in the nature of the fee arrangements. For example, contingent fees are dependent on 
the outcome of litigation, while noncontingent fixed or hourly fees are not."
172,19," The JIC has listed the following as ""other factors"" to be considered: ""Whether the lawyer-relative would receive a commission, contingency, or bonus from the instant case, or all of the firm's 
cases for a time period; whether the relative would receive a salary increase when the firm reaches a certain dollar amount 
in a given time period; the degree of kinship between the judge and the relative; the number of cases the firm has before 
the judge; and any other connections, dealings or relationships of the judge to other members of the relative's law firm."" Ala. Jud. Inquiry Comm'n Adv. Op. 93-500 (August 31, 1993)."
172,20," Justice Kennedy's vote regarding the motion to recuse was made prior to his resignation on June 11, 1999. "
177,1," A more thorough description of the humorous cards, as well as the less humorous litigation surrounding the cards' production, 
can be found in Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Assoc., 95 F.3d 959, 962-64 (10th Cir. 1996)."
177,2," As part of its request for injunctive relief, Cardtoons sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent 
MLBPA from interfering with Cardtoons's contractual relations with Champs. Cardtoons subsequently withdrew its request for 
these additional remedies when they were rendered moot by Champs's decision to stop producing the cards. "
178,3," In its briefs, Cardtoons seems to appeal the grant of summary judgment only with respect to the Champs letter. We note, 
however, that our conclusions would not change if the appeal also involved the Cardtoons letter. "
183,1," In fact, the majority admits that ""neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has directly addressed the issue of whether Noerr-
Pennington immunity attaches to the mere threat of a law suit."" Maj. Op. at 8. "
184,2," This test differs from the majority's test because the majority would grant Noerr-Pennington immunity solely on the ground of an 
objectively reasonable basis for the threat without also requiring that the threat be in good faith and proximate to actual or 
imminent litigation. "
185,3," As a result, the majority is wrong to imply that PRE contradicts the earlier circuit cases requiring threats of litigation to be in 
good faith in order to receive Noerr-Pennington immunity. While PRE may limit those cases to the extent that they also require 
actual litigation to be brought in good faith without first inquiring into objective baselessness, PRE does not touch upon the 
subjective test for whether threats of litigation should receive petitioning immunity. "
191,1," As explained infra, Full Draw's second amended complaint was the final complaint it filed and the one ruled upon by the district 
court. "
192,2," The new defendants were Saunders, NAP, Darton, and Bemans. It should be noted that, on appeal, Full Draw omits to place 
these defendants' names in the caption of its opening brief. Consequently, Darton submits a brief pursuant to 10th Cir. R. 31.3, 
arguing that Full Draw should be deemed to have abandoned its appeal against Darton. However, Full Draw points out that it 
included Darton in its notice of appeal, and that its omission of Darton from the caption of its opening brief was inadvertent. We 
decline to find that Full Draw abandoned its appeal against Darton because of a mere scrivener's error in the caption of Full 
Draw's opening brief. "

194,4," Not all group boycotts are necessarily per se violations. See FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d

when they are reviewed under a rule of reason, see ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 100-110 (4th 
ed. 1997)."
194,5," Although the second amended complaint sometimes describes defendant manufacturers and distributors as customers, it also 
alleges that they supply an essential product needed to make an archery trade show successful -- manufacturers and 
distributors displaying products at the show to attract retail dealers to attend the show. "
195,6," The district court's reliance on Stamatakis Indus., Inc. v. King, 965 F.2d 469 (7th Cir. 1992), and Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pacific 
Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360 (9th Cir. 1988), is misplaced. Although the Seventh Circuit stated in Stamatakis that ""a producer's 
loss is no concern of antitrust laws,"" it does not preclude a producer from alleging antitrust injury as a result of customer activity. 
See 965 F.2d at 471. Instead, Stamatakis requires that ""the plaintiff . . . show actual or potential injury to consumers."" Id. at 472. 
As quoted infra Part I.B.2., Full Draw alleged that the boycott injures consumers as well as itself by the non-competitive 
elimination of the BTS as AMMO's sole rival. Thus, we do not believe Stamatakis would preclude Full Draw's allegation of 
antitrust injury, even if the case were controlling authority, which it is not. Oahu Gas also does not undermine Full Draw's allegation of antitrust injury. There, the Ninth Circuit found, inter alia, that a 
propane gas seller did not prove any anticompetitive effects from a competitor's offer of sham low prices to the plaintiff's 
customers knowing that the effort would cause the plaintiff to meet the sham offer and consequently lose profits. The court found 
that the plaintiff did not allege anticompetitive effects from the competitor's offers of low but non-predatory prices, because the 
marketing scheme had the effect of increasing price competition. See 838 F.2d at 368, 370. As is apparent, Oaho Gas offers 
neither analogy nor language that precludes Full Draw's allegation of antitrust injury. "
196,7," This allegation answers the district court's statement that Full Draw failed to allege ""any harm to consumers or competition 
through reduced output or increased prices."""
196,8," Of course, in the words of SCFC, an agreement need not ""actually"" harm consumers directly to be considered anticompetitive. 
SCFC, 36 F.3d at 965. An agreement that harms a producer may ""potentially harm[] consumers"" downstream, id., and thus may 
be anticompetitive. "

223,1," Several other master distributors were involved in similar arrangements with the defendants. Although they were apparently 
named in the original complaint, they have now settled with the plaintiffs and are no longer participating in this case."
223,2," The Beer World stores are separately incorporated and named in the complaint as A.E.V., Inc., Beer and Pop Warehouse, Inc., 
Jet Distributor, Inc., Q.F.A., Inc., and Red Sky, Inc., all of which operate under the Beer World name. Trone is named personally 
in the complaint, along with the consulting business he runs, Retail Services and Systems, Inc. Fuhrer includes both Frank B. 
Fuhrer, Jr. himself and his business, Frank B. Fuhrer Wholesale Co. "
225,3," It might seem surprising that Trone was the first to come up with the beer supermarket concept. Indeed, one might think that it 
would have been around for decades. Perhaps he was simply the first to bring this idea to Pennsylvania. At all events, these 
ruminations have no bearing on the outcome of this case. "
227,4," These claims include price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13; common-law fraud; 
common-law conspiracy to defraud; and RICO violations predicated on mail fraud in the mailing of price lists by Fuhrer, 18 
U.S.C. ยงยง 1341, 1962. The Robinson-Patman Act claim was dismissed early on, and the plaintiffs have not appealed from that 
dismissal. See Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19761, Civ. A. No. 92-556, 1994 WL 682756 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 26, 
1994). The plaintiffs' others claims are discussed in infra note 7."
227,5," Since we will affirm the District Court's judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' RICO claim, we need not consider 
specifically whether it erred in denying the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment."
227,6," The District Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the RICO claim to the extent it was based on 
actions prior to March 1988, four years before the present suit was filed, because the plaintiffs should have been aware of the 
defendants' acts prior to that time. The plaintiffs contend that the District Court's conclusion erroneously rested on the fact that 
some of them filed a state lawsuit against Trone and the Beer World stores in 1986 alleging similar concerns, during which they "
228,," could have obtained sufficient discovery to bring their present claims. They argue that their attorney misled them into believing 
they could not pursue their claim in that context, and that the statute of limitations should be tolled equitably. We recently explained that attorney misconduct can give rise to equitable tolling only in unusual circumstances. See Seitzinger 
v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 165 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). The plaintiffs contend that such unusual circumstances are 
present here, because their attorney allegedly was conflicted in that he also represented Fuhrer, and because, unlike Seitzinger, 
the lack of information on which to base a claim was at least arguably a result of the defendants' fraud. Furthermore, the 
plaintiffs note that, given the tremendous difficulties they faced in obtaining adequate discovery from the defendants in this case, 
the defendants cannot contend that the plaintiffs would have been able to obtain sufficient discovery in the previous state case. 
On the other hand, the defendants point out that, even if they fraudulently concealed certain facts, the plaintiffs were aware of 
those facts by the end of 1987. We need not decide this issue, because we will affirm the District Court's dismissal of the RICO 
claim in its entirety on other grounds."
228,7," As noted above, the plaintiffs brought additional RICO and common-law tort claims. In the same series of orders identified in 
the text, the District Court granted summary judgment on these claims in the defendants' favor. We will affirm those aspects of 
the judgment summarily. The plaintiffs' common-law claims are that Fuhrer issued price lists that were fraudulent because they did not state the volume 
discount the Beer World stores received, and that Trone and Fuhrer conspired to misrepresent the prices through the same 
mechanism. Claims for common-law fraud and conspiracy are governed by a two-year statute of limitations. See 42 Pa. Cons. 
Stat. ยง 5524(7). The discount was discontinued at the end of 1989, and the plaintiffs were aware of the discount before then. The 
complaint was filed in March of 1992. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that more than two years had elapsed between 
the defendants' fraudulent acts and the filing of the complaint, and that the claim was therefore time-barred. Since the plaintiffs 
have not addressed this issue in the briefs (or, apparently, before the District Court), and the District Court's decision appears to 
be correct, we will affirm the District Court's judgment as to the common-law claims summarily. The other RICO claim was based on Fuhrer's allegedly fraudulent mailing of price lists that did not include the $ .25/case volume 
discount offered to the Beer Worlds. This discount was begun in September of 1987. Fuhrer did not mail a price list thereafter 
until March of 1988, and the plaintiffs were aware of the discount by October of that year. The District Court analyzed whether 
this constituted a ""pattern of racketeering activity,"" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962, in light of long-standing precedent. See, e.g., H.J., Inc. v. 
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195, 109 S. Ct. 2893 (1989). First, the Court concluded that this 
was not an open-ended pattern because, as Fuhrer discontinued the discount in 1989, the alleged fraud was unlikely to recur. 
Second, the Court found that fraud of six months' duration could not constitute a closed-ended pattern. See, e.g., Tabas v. 
Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280, 1293 (3d Cir. 1995) (""Since H.J., Inc., this court has faced the question of continued racketeering activities 
in several cases, each time finding that conduct lasting no more than twelve months did not meet the standard for closed-ended 
continuity."" (citing cases)). Because the plaintiffs could prove no pattern of racketeering activity, the District Court concluded that 
they could not bring a successful RICO claim based on the price lists. Since the plaintiffs have not discussed this issue in their 
briefs and the District Court's reasoning is persuasive, we will affirm the District Court's judgment in favor of the defendants on 
this other RICO claim, also summarily. "
229,8," The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1337 and 1367, as well as 15 U.S.C. ยง 15. We have 
appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. "
230,9," We also note that the present plaintiffs' counsel came to the case late as well, after much of its present contours had been 
fixed. "
231,10," Given our conclusion that the customer and expert evidence of causation is sufficient, we need not consider the plaintiffs' other 
arguments for reversing the District Court's conclusion that they had not adduced sufficient evidence of causation: (1) that a 
price differential permits an automatic presumption of causation of loss to those who pay the higher price, see Bogosian v. Gulf 
Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 455 (3d Cir. 1977), and (2) that the defendants' own statements and ""admissions"" constitute proof of 
causation. "
233,11," The defendants also complain that, even if the testimony is otherwise admissible under Rule 803(3), it is not admissible, 
particularly for use at the summary judgment stage, because the declarants are unidentified or inadequately identified. First, the 
defendants contend that this means the evidence cannot meet the plaintiffs' burden to defeat a motion for summary judgment 
because it is not in an admissible form. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (""Supporting and opposing affidavits [introduced at the 
summary judgment stage] . . . shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence . . . .""); Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, 
Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1234 n.9 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that evidence introduced to defeat a motion for 
summary judgment must be ""capable of being admissible at trial""). In particular, the defendants argue that, since the declarants 
are unidentified, there is no way to ensure that they will be able or willing to testify at trial. We need not consider this issue, 
however, because the statements are admissible hearsay as discussed in the text. Moreover, contrary to the defendants' apparent suggestion, we do not think that the fact that the declarants are not specifically 
identified is relevant for determining whether their statements fall within the Rule 803(3) hearsay exception. The defendants cite 
Philbin v. Trans Union Corp., 101 F.3d 957 (3d Cir. 1996), for the proposition that a hearsay statement by an unidentified or 
unknown person ""is not 'capable of being admissible at trial.' "" Philbin, 101 F.3d at 961 n.1 (quoting Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1234 
n.9). Philbin is distinguishable, however. The plaintiff in that case relied on the statement of an unidentified official of the 
defendant as direct evidence of the defendant's allegedly unlawful motive in a Fair Credit Reporting Act suit. The declarant's 
identity was important to ensure that he or she was in fact an official of the defendant company whose statement would be 
admissible nonhearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d). Identity was a critical element of admissibility. The customers' statements in this case, however, are different. In a practical sense, their identities are not important. The 
relevance of their statements depends only on the fact that they were the plaintiffs' customers, not their particular identities. 
Furthermore, we do not think that HN8[
] the admissibility of their statements under the Rule 803(3) hearsay exception depends on their being identified. Knowing the specific identity of the declarant will not make the statements more trustworthy 
evidence of the declarants' descriptions of their states of mind, the primary concern in interpreting hearsay exceptions. In United States v. Mitchell, 145 F.3d 572, 576-77 (3d Cir. 1998), we held that the identity of the declarant is a substantial, 
although not determinative, factor in determining whether a hearsay statement is admissible under the present sense impression 
or the excited utterance exceptions to the hearsay rule. The proposed evidence in that case was an anonymous note purportedly 
identifying a getaway car. We held that the note was not admissible as a present sense impression or excited utterance because 
there was no evidence that the unidentified declarant personally perceived the event or condition about which the statement is 
made. With respect to a state-of-mind statement, however, it is only important that the declarant be the person whose state of 
mind the statement concerns, which is true by definition. "
236,12," More specifically, the expert's report based its analysis on two premises. First, it assumed that Stelwagon's sales of the 
product at issue during the year in which it did not allegedly suffer antitrust harm were representative of what the sales would 
have been in the absence of such harm. Second, the expert assumed that its sales of this product would follow a pattern similar 
to that of other products Stelwagon sold. Finally, the expert posited that Stelwagon would have been able to charge the same 
retail markup on the product at issue as it did on other products. Based on these assumptions, the expert calculated Stelwagon's 
lost sales and profits. See Stelwagon, 63 F.3d at 1275. "
237,13," The defendants also contend that, even if Seidel has shown that the defendants' acts caused the damages, he has not shown 
that the defendants' illegal acts caused damages. The defendants are correct that Seidel failed to account for many variations in 
what the defendants did during the periods that Seidel aggregated for analysis. We cannot evaluate this contention without a 
clearer picture of the scope of the defendants' antitrust violations, however. In the absence of such a clarification, we will leave it "
238,," to the District Court to consider this objection in the first instance after examining the plaintiffs' antitrust liability theories in greater 
depth. Only after such a closer examination can this criticism of Seidel's report be given adequate consideration. "
239,14," The defendants offer as an alternative ground for affirming the dismissal of the plaintiffs' antitrust claim that the plaintiffs have 
failed to show that they suffered an ""antitrust injury."" Since we have declined to consider whether the plaintiffs have offered "
240,," sufficient evidence of antitrust violations at the present time, we will also refrain from considering the defendants' contention that 
the plaintiffs cannot prove an antitrust injury. See supra Part II."
240,15," Although the Court in Holmes adopted these three factors for RICO cases from Associated General Contractors, we 
recognized in Steamfitters that the Court in the latter case had outlined six factors relevant to antitrust proximate causation 
analysis. See Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 924. These factors included: (1) the causal connection between defendant's wrongdoing and plaintiff 's harm; (2) the specific intent of defendant to harm 
plaintiff; (3) the nature of plaintiff 's alleged injury (and whether it relates to the purpose of antitrust laws, i.e., ensuring 
competition within economic markets); (4) ""the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury""; (5) whether the ""damages 
claim is . . . highly speculative""; and (6) ""keeping the scope of complex antitrust trials within judicially manageable limits,"" 
i.e., ""avoiding either the risk of duplicate recoveries on the one hand, or the danger of complex apportionment of damages 
on the other."" Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 924 (quoting Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 537-38, 540, 542-44). In our discussion of 
proximate causation for the RICO claims in Steamfitters, in addition to analyzing the Holmes factors, we incorporated by 
reference our discussion of the Associated General Contractors factors from the antitrust analysis. We did not express an "
241,," opinion as to whether the Holmes factors replace the Associated General Contractors factors for RICO claims or merely 
supplement them. At all events, to the extent the Associated General Contractors factors are relevant only to antitrust analysis, they are irrelevant 
in the present case. In addition, to the extent that any of the issues raised in these factors are not included in Holmes, they only 
weigh against a finding of proximate causation. For example, the second factor, specific intent to injure, is arguably not included 
in Holmes. To the extent it is not, however, we think it would be difficult on the present facts to conclude that the defendants 
specifically intended to harm the plaintiffs. Although harm to the plaintiffs may have been a probable ultimate consequence of 
the defendants' actions, we do not think they specifically intended to cause such harm. Accordingly, considering this factor in 
addition to the Holmes analysis would only provide an additional reason to conclude that proximate causation is lacking."
241,16," In a recent case, we concluded that RICO proximate causation existed without specifically analyzing the Holmes factors. See 
Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494 (3d Cir. 1998). That case is distinguishable, however. The 
plaintiff BCI had formerly been the administrator of a pharmacy's self-funded employee health-insurance plan. When the 
pharmacy opened a new branch that it wanted to be a part of U.S. Healthcare's network, U.S. Healthcare essentially forced the 
pharmacy to use a U.S. Healthcare affiliate as its health-plan administrator, rather than the plaintiff. We concluded that, in such 
circumstances, proximate causation could exist: The injury proved by BCI, the loss of its TPA contract with Gary's [the pharmacy], is not derivative of any losses suffered by 
Gary's. Unlike the injuries suffered by the non-purchasing customers in Holmes, BCI's injury was not contingent upon any 
injury to Gary's, nor is it more appropriately attributable to an intervening cause that was not a predicate act under RICO. 
Here, BCI's administrator relationship with Gary's was the direct target of the alleged scheme -- indeed, interference with 
that relationship may well be deemed the linchpin of the scheme's success. Brokerage Concepts, 140 F.3d at 521. The plaintiffs contend, similarly, that interference with their relationship with their 
customers, i.e., attracting the plaintiffs' customers to shop at Beer World stores, the precise harm the plaintiffs suffered, is the 
""linchpin of [Trone's] scheme's success."" Although it may be true that interference in the relationship between the plaintiffs and 
their customers was the linchpin of the success of Trone's scheme, we think Brokerage Concepts is distinguishable. The relationship between the alleged racketeering activities and the injuries to the plaintiffs are more distant than they were in 
Brokerage Concepts. In the latter case, the pharmacy, the party with whom BCI had a relationship with which U.S. Healthcare 
interfered, was the direct target of U.S. Healthcare's alleged racketeering activities, which included extortion and commercial 
bribery. See Brokerage Concepts, 140 F.3d at 521. Here, although the ultimate goal of Trone and the Beer World stores was 
presumably to woo customers away from the plaintiffs, the direct target of its alleged fraudulent scheme was the LCB, not 
customers. Unlike Brokerage Concepts, this case involves two third parties, one that was the target of the defendants' 
racketeering and another that had a relationship with the plaintiffs with which the defendants interfered."
241,17," In Holmes, the plaintiffs (actually the plaintiffs' subrogors, although that was not relevant to the result) were customers of 
broker-dealers that had failed as a result of the defendants' conspiracy to manipulate certain stocks. As a result of the broker-
dealers' failure, their customers suffered losses. The particular plaintiffs in Holmes were customers of the broker-dealers who 
never purchased the particular stocks that the defendants had manipulated. Thus, the plaintiffs' losses were not an immediate 
result of the defendants' manipulations, but rather were a derivative effect of the collapse of the broker-dealers. The Court found 
this connection insufficient to establish proximate causation for RICO claims. See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 271. Steamfitters involved claims of union health and welfare funds against tobacco companies. The funds alleged that the tobacco 
companies had defrauded the funds by misleading them into believing that tobacco products were safe and could not be made 
safer. As a result of this fraud, the funds did not take steps to reduce their costs by, for example, attempting to reduce smoking 
among their participants or undertaking legal efforts to shift the costs of smoking back to the companies. The funds were harmed 
because their participants continued to smoke and accumulate medical bills that the funds were obligated to pay. We concluded 
that this causal chain was too attenuated to satisfy the requirements of proximate causation. See 171 F.3d at 932-34. "
242,18," The plaintiffs argue that, since the defendants' antitrust violations were a proximate cause of the plaintiffs' losses, a point the 
defendants do not -- unlike the issue of causation in fact--presently contest, the RICO violations must also be a proximate cause 
of their losses. They base this contention on our recognition in Steamfitters that proximate causation principles for antitrust and 
RICO claims are closely related. See Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 921 (""The standing requirements for RICO and antitrust claims 
are similar, and . . . the standing analysis under these federal laws is drawn from common-law principles of proximate cause and 
remoteness of injury . . . .""). The plaintiffs misread Steamfitters. Admittedly, we said in that case that ""much (if not all) of what we have said above in our 
discussion of antitrust standing applies to the Funds' RICO claims."" See 171 F.3d at 932. But that was simply a recognition that 
the factual underpinnings of the causation chains in the funds' antitrust and RICO claims was so similar. The plaintiffs' theory of 
antitrust proximate causation in this case, however, is factually distinct from their RICO theory. Causation in their antitrust claim 
rests on the simple notion that the defendants contracted, combined and conspired to force the wholesalers to offer them beer at 
a lower price, which gave them a competitive advantage over the plaintiffs. Their RICO claim, however, rests on the more 
complicated theory of causation discussed in the text. It includes the additional step that Trone was able to operate the Beer 
World stores as a group because of his fraud on the LCB, which enabled him to obtain discounts which hurt the plaintiffs. This 
additional step distinguishes the plaintiffs' RICO and antitrust claims, and bars the inference of proximate causation they 
suggest, for reasons amplified in the text, infra. "
244,19," The plaintiffs in their supplemental memorandum discussing Steamfitters contend that we cannot consider the wholesalers in 
our Holmes calculus because ""they have decided to make their separate peace with Beer World, no doubt for the same reasons 
they decided to acquiesce in this scheme in the first place."" Appellant's Post-Arg. Memo. at 13. While it may be true that the 
wholesalers in this case have not attempted to recover from the defendants, we do not think this is relevant to our Holmes 
analysis. We do not think the question whether the defendants' fraud proximately caused the plaintiffs' injuries can turn on 
whether some other potential claimants have filed suit. Although the broker-dealers identified in Holmes as having a potential 
claim did in fact sue the defendants in that case, see Holmes, 503 U.S. at 273 & n.21, we recognized in Steamfitters that the fact 
that smokers themselves could bring claims against the tobacco companies was relevant to determining proximate causation 
with respect to the funds, even though the smokers were in fact unlikely to bring claims on their own, see Steamfitters, 171 F.3d 
at 933. "
245,20," See App. at 43. The court dismissed the tampering charges on the ground that they should have been brought under a more 
specific statute, the Liquor Code, see Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, ยง 4-436(j) (West 1997), which makes false statements on liquor 
license applications a misdemeanor. See App. at 25-31. The alleged tampering therefore also could not serve as part of the 
pattern of racketeering activity necessary to support the racketeering charge, since Liquor Code violations are not specified as 
racketeering activities in section 911. See App. at 39 n.6; 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. ยง 911(h). Since the only remaining racketeering 
activity was one alleged instance of perjury on the part of Trone, the court concluded that there was no ""pattern of racketeering 
activity"" as required to support a racketeering charge. See App. at 40."
245,21," Judge Wellford in his dissent contends that we cannot consider the wholesalers or the Commonwealth as potential alternative 
agents for the vindication of the public interest, because in this case none of them brought suit against Trone and the Beer World 
stores. We think this circumstance is irrelevant to determining whether the plaintiffs' injuries are too remote from the defendants' 
actions to be a proximate cause for the RICO claim. The post-injury actions of intervening parties cannot make the plaintiffs' 
losses more or less of a direct result of the defendants' actions. The only question is whether these intervening parties are ones 
that possibly could take steps to deter illegal activity as contemplated in Holmes. See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70 (""Directly 
injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general . . . ."" (emphasis added)); 503 U.S. 
at 273 (""Those directly injured . . . could be counted on to bring suit for the law's vindication . . . .""). "

258,2," We note that every party has a right to timely oppose a motion for summary judgment. In Delgado Biaggi v. Air Transport Local 
501, 112 F.3d 565 (1st Cir. 1997), the Court of Appeals reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment, since the judge 
failed to give the opposing party the opportunity to file within the 10-day period prescribed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The Court 
noted: ""Summary judgment targets should be secure in the knowledge that they will have at least ten days in which to formulate

was unable to comply with the Court's generous extension of time."

280,5," Although Standard Oil might argue that the independent refiner was not injured by the antitrust violation because the 
independent refiner passed the price increase along to its customers (such as the plaintiff), this defense was rejected as a

282,7," Most notably, American Stores is ambiguous on whether a court should apply the Porter v. Warner principle equally to actions

302,3," ""Retail wheeling"" is defined as ""allowing a customer to have access to MidAmerican's transmission and distribution facilities so 
that a customer can procure electricity from a third party to be delivered through MidAmerican's transmission and distribution

1999)."
302,4, The district court treated the motion as one for summary judgment since the parties submitted affidavits.
302,5," MidAmerican specifically presented the state with three questions. The first question is particularly relevant to this matter: Does the Board's assignment of an exclusive service area to MidAmerican, pursuant to Iowa Code ยงยง 476.22 through 
476.26 and related sections, give MidAmerican the exclusive right and responsibility to sell electricity to retail customers 
within the assigned service area, or are MidAmerican's rights and obligations limited to the transmission and distribution of 
electricity that may be provided competitively by other sellers to retail customers. "
303,, Id. Note that North Star proceeded to file comments in opposition to the Petition.
303,6," Under Iowa law, the district court acts in an appellate capacity to correct errors of law by the administrative agency. See 
Freeland v. Employment Appeal Bd., 492 N.W.2d 193, 196 (Iowa 1992). "
304,7," North Star argues that there are three vertical markets in the industry, each of which has a different level of competition. These 
markets are: (1) the generation of electric energy; (2) the transmission of high voltage electric power from the generation plants 
to substations for conversion to delivery voltages; and (3) the distribution of low voltage electricity to retail customers. See Brief 
for Appellant at 14. "
305,8," The Iowa Supreme Court has found defensive issue preclusion to occur when stranger to the judgment [in the former action], 
ordinarily the defendant in the second action, relies upon [that] judgment as conclusively establishing in his favor an issue which 
he must prove as an element of his defense."" Brown v. Kassouf, 558 N.W.2d 161, 164 (Iowa 1997)."
305,9," The statute provides that:HN5[
] It is declared to be in the public interest to encourage the development of co-ordinated statewide electric service at retail, to 
eliminate or avoid unnecessary duplication of electric utility facilities, and to promote economical, efficient, and adequate 
electric service to the public. In order to effect that public interest, the board may establish service areas within which 
specified electric utilities shall provide electric service to customers on an exclusive basis. IOWA CODE ยง 476.25 (1997). "

314,1," For purposes of this appeal, we consider Elo Touch as the patentholder, as neither the parties nor the district court have 
suggested that the outcome should depend upon Elo Touch's status as an exclusive licensee. "
316,2," From the last sentence of this quote it appears that the district court was primarily concerned with a possible conflict with the 
federal antitrust laws. However, possible conflict with the patent laws was also at issue; indeed, that is Elo Touch's principal 
argument on appeal. Accordingly, we consider both possible conflicts. "
319,3," At this stage of the case it appears that neither the parties nor the district court have explicitly analyzed the relevant text of ยง 
43(a), or the required elements of a claim arising therefrom, to determine whether ยง 43(a) reaches Exzec's allegations. We note 
in passing, without any assessment of the merits, that several district courts in recent years have recognized particular ยง 43(a) 
claims involving marketplace representations of patent infringement. See, e.g., Wicker Group v. Standard Register Co., 1994 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20236, 33 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1678, 1680 (E.D. Va. 1994); Minebea Co. v. Papst, 13 F. Supp. 2d 35, 44

Supp. at 174. We leave it to the parties and the district court to more fully consider whether Exzec's particular allegations in its 
pleading state the necessary elements of a ยง 43(a) claim. "
333,1," Defendants, citing Janicki Logging Co. v. Mateer, 42 F.3d 561, 566 (9th Cir. 1994), argue that the district court's decision to 
deny leave to amend should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. The motion in Janicki involved the court's management of its 
own docket: the plaintiff sought to name an additional defendant eighteen months after it had filed its complaint, a year after the 
deadline for naming additional parties in the court's scheduling order had expired, and eighteen months after plaintiff's separate 
action against the proposed defendant had been dismissed by a different court. See id. In contrast, the motion to amend in this 
case turns on the merits: whether Plaintiffs have alleged valid causes of action. We therefore review both the motion to dismiss 
and the motion for leave to amend de novo."
333,2," California's Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยงยง 16700-16770, is patterned after the Sherman Act. California courts look 
to federal case law interpreting the Sherman Act for guidance in interpreting the Cartwright Act. See Chicago Title Ins. Co. v.

334,3," HN7[
] Because price-fixing is a per se antitrust violation, price inflation is presumed. Courts do not evaluate the 
reasonableness of the price when determining whether price-fixing agreements are unlawful. See Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 350 & n.22, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982)."
334,4," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have standing to bring an antitrust action only if they compete with Defendants. This is 
incorrect. Consumers have standing to challenge antitrust violations that cause them injury. Indeed, purchasers are preferred 
antitrust plaintiffs in price-fixing cases. See 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law Par. 370 (1995). "
335,5," Defendants argue that the Resort Association cannot be liable for antitrust violations because it is a nonprofit association. A 
nonprofit organization that engages in commercial activity, however, is subject to federal antitrust laws. See Dedication and 
Everlasting Love to Animals v. Humane Soc'y of the United States, Inc., 50 F.3d 710, 713 (9th Cir. 1995) (dictum); 1A Areeda &

(learned professions are subject to antitrust laws). The RA provides its members with access to discount lift tickets and lodging 
referrals and markets its members' services, all of which are commercial activities."
335,6," Plaintiff referral associations that allege a loss of membership due to the RA's policies may establish standing in their own right, 
cf.  Thompson v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566, 1571 (11th Cir. 1991), and otherwise may be able to establish 
standing to sue on behalf of their members, see 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp Par. 379b. "
337,7," The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that ""clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors 
therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any 
party . . . ."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a) (emphasis added). The United States District Court for the Central District of California has no 
local rules recognizing or governing motions for modification or clarification."

grounds, inter alia, of ""a manifest showing of a failure to consider material facts presented to the Court before such decision."" 
C.D. Cal. L. Civ. R. 7.16(c). "
338,9," At oral argument, Plaintiffs stated they would still prefer to dismiss their federal claims and have the case remanded to state 
court. On remand, the district court may, in its discretion, grant Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to eliminate their federal 
claims, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, and remand the case to state court."
338,10," Although it contains a section entitled, ""Appellate Court Jurisdiction,"" Plaintiffs' brief does not identify the source of the court's 
jurisdiction in this section, as required by Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(4) and 9th Cir. R. 28-2.2. The brief also fails to identify the 
standard of review for any of the issues raised on appeal, as required by Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(B) and 9th Cir. R. 28-2.5. 
Finally, the brief does not contain a statement of issues, as required by Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(5). Plaintiffs' failure to comply with 
the briefing rules is all the more unjustified because we had already rejected Plaintiffs' initial brief as deficient: it did not include a 
certificate of compliance, Fed. R. App. P. 32(a)(7)(c); 9th Cir. R. 32-1, a statement of related cases, 9th Cir. R. 28-2.6, or

341,2," In 1993 a criminal complaint was filed against Defendants HeereMac and Jan Meek alleging that they and unnamed others had 
combined and conspired ""to suppress and eliminate  [*5] competition by rigging bids for the sale of heavy-lift derrick barge and 
related marine construction services in the United States and elsewhere"" from ""at least as early as 1993 and continuing until 
May 1997."" Criminal Information, Ex. A to First Amended Complaint. HeereMac and Jan Meek pled guilty to the criminal 
information on December 23, 1997 and agreed to pay fines of $ 49 million and $ 100,000 respectively. Ex. B, Transcript of guilty 
plea hearing. Plaintiffs here and in Phillips claim that only when the criminal case became public did they learn of the conspiracy. HeereMac provided heavy-lift marine construction services to customers in three distinct geographic markets--the Mahogany 
platform in the Gulf of Mexico, several platforms in the North Sea, and the Xijiang platform off the coast of China in the Far East. 
The plea agreement addressed separately issues related to commerce affected by HeereMac's conduct in the Gulf of Mexico 
and commerce affected by HeereMac's conduct in the North Sea and Far East. Thus issues regarding price fixing activities in 
the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea were treated separately. Moreover, in the plea agreement HeereMac contended that the 
 [*6] Department of Justice would not be able to establish (1) how conduct related to foreign commerce violated the United 
States antitrust laws and (2) how this foreign conduct affected United States commerce for purposes of the Federal Sentencing 
Guidelines. The Department of Justice, moreover, admitted establishing liability for foreign conduct would be difficult. The plea 
agreement makes no reference to the Hewett or Judy projects in the North Sea, does not suggest that those projects were part "
342,," of any conspiracy, does not admit that activity or projects in the North Sea had a ""direct, substantial and foreseeable"" effect on 
United States commerce, and alone does not establish the existence of a conspiracy. In Phillips, this Court concluded that the collateral estoppel effect of the guilty plea is limited to HeereMac's admission that it was a participant in a price-fixing conspiracy involving heavy lift marine construction 
services in the major oil producing regions of the world (the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, and the Far East) from 1993 
through 1997 and that $ 65,000,0000 in commerce in the Gulf of Mexico was affected. The guilty plea and conviction do not 
establish the extent of the  [*7] Court's jurisdiction here, that liability exists as to the Phillips jobs at issue here or that other 
Defendants here were involved in the conspiracy. It does not establish that the conspiracy caused antitrust injury to these 
named Defendants, nor, if it did, what damages are appropriate."
342,3," Statoil, referring to the complaint ( # 21) that it amended after the Court's order issued in Phillips, asserts at p. 4 of its 
Consolidated Response to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss ( # 41), . . . Defendants' conspiracy had a substantial effect on U.S. foreign and interstate commerce by reducing the supply of 
crude oil production in the North Sea, which in turn increased the prices paid by U.S. consumers for North Sea crude oil, a 
significant source of U.S. supply. Complaint at PP 52, 78. Further, many of the licensees of the affected North Sea projects 
of which Statoil is the operator include subsidiaries of U.S. oil companies. Preamble to Complaint; Statoil's Supplemental Disclosure of Interested Persons dated February 4, 1999. These 
subsidiaries have suffered their pro rata share of applicable damages as a result of the increase in prices of heavy lift 
services and they will enjoy a corresponding share of Statoil's recovery in this litigation. Complaint at PP 70-81."
342,4," Sections 1 and 2 of  [*10] the Sherman Act, prohibit restraints of trade, monopolization and attempts to monopolize. Section 1 of the Sherman Act reads, "

several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or

343,5," The FTAIA was added to the Sherman Act in 1982. Although the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1-2, prohibits monopolization and 
attempted monopolization of any line of interstate or foreign commerce, section 1 of the FTAIA, 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a, restricts and 
makes it inapplicable to certain kinds of commerce. The FTAIA provides in relevant part, [Section 1-7 of the Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import 
commerce) with foreign nations unless-- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect-- (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import  [*12] trade or import 
commerce with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the 
United States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of [this Act], other than this section. According to an additional proviso, if sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of 1 
(B), then sections 1-7 of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States. Here, clause 1(A), rather than 1(B), of the FTAIA governs, so the location of the Defendants as suppliers of services is not 
relevant to the question of whether the alleged conspiracy directly, substantially and reasonably foreseeably affected United

401,1," To date, the court has received no motions or objections from Whitacre or his counsel concerning sentencing other than his 
motion to waive his physical appearance and to be sentenced via videoconferencing. Whitacre's motion is denied in part since 
amazingly the state-of-the-art Edgefield Federal Correctional Institute in South Carolina, Whitacre's current penal institution, has 
no video link with the U.S. Courts. Hence, his sentencing must be performed via telephonic conference call. Whitacre rode on 
the coat tails of the successful joint motion of Andreas and Wilson with respect to the imposition of the alternative fine provision 
under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3571(d). However, absent filing his own motions, such will not be the case for any remaining sentencing

Office. This case presented highly complex sentencing issues involving antitrust law never confronted by any court, or its

district court and the parties have treated the state and federal antitrust claims as one and the same for purposes of standing 
analysis. We do the same. "
429,5," Plaintiffs' argument that their standing to bring RICO and antitrust actions is ""confirmed"" by state and common law rules 
governing proximate cause, as well as trust law, ignores the test set out by the Supreme Court for analyzing standing in RICO 
and antitrust cases. This argument also ignores the fact that there is an alternative route for the trusts to recover the damages 
alleged in the present action - via subrogation in a non-RICO, non-antitrust action. See Laborers Local 17, 172 F.3d at 235. "

the existing bus routes on Oahu. Okano testified that, if Central had bid on Group 4, Central would have been disqualified by the

461,19," Appellees also contend that appellants' HRS ยง 480-2 claims fail because appellees are shielded by the doctrine of ""state

] The ""state action immunity"" doctrine provides that losing bidders are barred from bringing antitrust 
claims against either the agency or successful bidder, where the state has exclusive control of a bidding process and creates a 
monopoly by awarding all contracts to one successful bidder. See Buckley Constr., Inc. v. Shawnee Civ. & Cultural Dev. Auth., 
933 F.2d 853 (10th Cir. 1991). The challenging bidder must show that: (1) ""the challenged behavior is sanctioned by a clearly

Antitrust Principles and Their Application P221, at 357 (rev. ed. 1997). Appellees defense in this regard is meritless. It is patently 
obvious that DAGS intended to foster competition. Without addressing the state immunity doctrine in greater depth, we have 
serious reservations that it would apply to shield a successful bidder where there is evidence that such bidder attempted to 
deceive a state agency concerning its independence from another bidder in order to circumvent bidding rules. Appellees also adduced considerable evidence at trial to prove that RHSB and STI had unclean hands. It is well settled that 
HN25[

Principles and Their Application PP302-3, at 2-7 (rev. ed. 1997) (Areeda & Hovenkamp). Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act 
provides in part: ""Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared 
to be illegal. . . ."""
462,22," Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act provides: Monopolizing trade a felony; penalty. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding 
$ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both

462,24," Enacted in 1914, the Clayton Act was targeted at activities which substantially lessened competition, providing more specific 
proscriptions to antitrust legislation, as well as a private remedies provision. See 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P303, at 2-10. 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: "
463,," Suits by persons injured. (a) Amount of recovery; prejudgment interest[.] Except as provided in subsection (b) of this 
section, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an

unlawful."" "
465,26," This court, in Ai, 61 Haw. at 612 n.10, 607 P.2d at 1309 n.10, interpreted this language as establishing conclusively the 
legislature's intent to create a private cause of action for all violations of Section 480-2. However, as noted above, Ai entailed an 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim, not an unfair methods of competition claim. Furthermore, the Ai court cited, among 
other cases, Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 454, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456, 77 S. Ct. 390, reh'g denied, 353 U.S. 
931, 1 L. Ed. 2d 724, 77 S. Ct. 716 (1957), which is inapposite to private enforcement of unfair competition claims.  Radovich, 
352 U.S. at 446-47, involved violations of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which fall squarely within the private 
enforcement measures of section 4 of the Clayton Act--unlike section 5 of the FTCA. What is most telling is that (1) nearly all of 
the legislative history relating to HRS ยง 480-2 focuses upon consumer protection through unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
and (2) there is no discussion of the effects that recognizing a private claim for unfair competition would have on competition--
when protecting competition is one of the fundamental purposes of antitrust legislation. This leads us to conclude that the 
legislature did not intend to extend HRS ยง 480-13 to unfair methods of competition claims. Insofar as Ai, 61 Haw. at 612, 607 
P.2d at 1308-09, holds that a private cause of action exists for unfair methods of competition under HRS ยง 480-2, it is overruled. "
466,27," This court, in Island Tobacco Co., 63 Haw. at 301, 627 P.2d at 269, stated that HRS ยง 480-2 is designed to aid ""competitors,"" as much as to protect ""competition."" And unlike the Federal Trade Commission Act, the 
policy of Hawaii law, as expressed in HRS ยง 480-13, is to foster private suits grounded on unfair or deceptive trade 
practices even where the unlawful acts do not culminate in injury to ""competition."" See id. at 301 n.12, 627 P.2d at 269 n.12 (citing Hse. Standing Comm. Rep. No. 735-74, in 1974 House Journal 829, 830; Sen. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 703-74, in 1974 Senate Journal 1020, 1021). As noted above, Island Tobacco Co. did not involve an 
unfair methods of competition claim. Furthermore, because the legislature specifically limited a competitor's ability to bring an 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim to consumers, see HRS ยง 480-2(d); Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Haw. 54, 61-
62, 905 P.2d 29, 36-37 (1995), we do not regard Island Tobacco Co. as being dispositive on this issue. Insofar as Island 
Tobacco Co., 63 Haw. at 301, 627 P.2d at 269, holds that a private cause of action exists for unfair methods of competition 
under HRS ยง 480-2, it is also overruled. "

468,30," It has been argued that section 480-13(a) is an automatic damages provision. The plain language of HRS ยง 480-13(a), 
however, requires some evidence of damage. Indeed, ""while proof of a violation of chapter 480 is an essential element of an

that the antitrust laws are intended to protect competition rather than competitors does not mean that a competitor is never a 
proper antitrust plaintiff. Indeed, protecting a competitor's ability to compete from a conspiracy, the sole purpose of which is to 
decrease competition by eliminating that competitor, is clearly in the interest of competition. "
484,2," The District Court erred by incorporating the issue of anticompetitive market effect into its standing analysis, confusing antitrust 
injury with an element of a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, which prohibits ""contracts, combinations or 
conspiracies 'in restraint of trade.' "" The court's approach may have been the result of the similar ""antitrust injury"" label which is 
applied to the injury component of antitrust standing analysis and to the marketplace harm element under section 1."
484,3," We reject Angelico's assertion (citing Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 212, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 
705 (1959)) that the hospital defendants' acts should be held illegal per se. Courts follow one of two lines of analysis to assess 
the validity of section 1 claims. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 342-47, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 2472-74, 73 
L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982). The first, ""rule of reason"" analysis, applies in most cases under this section, while the second, ""per se"" 
analysis, applies only to ""agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study 
of the industry is needed to establish their illegality."" National Soc'y of Prof. Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 
1355, 1365, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978). HN5[
] Group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal are not always per se violations of the Sherman Act; rather, the analysis 
turns on the facial effects of the challenged practice. See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing 
Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985). Similar cases involving medical professionals have utilized the ""rule 
of reason"" analysis. See Betkerur v. Aultman Hosp. Ass'n, 78 F.3d 1079, 1088-93 & n. 9 (6th Cir. 1996) (discussing and 
rejecting application of per se analysis to a doctor's claims under section 1 and citing, in the footnote, Lie v. St. Joseph Hosp., 
964 F.2d 567, 570 (6th Cir.1992), and other cases holding that rule of reason analysis is normally applied to claims by 
physicians in the position of Angelico). We see no reason to depart from this approach. "
485,4," We note in this regard that Angelico's counsel conceded at oral argument that he did not need further discovery into the 
element of marketplace harm. We likewise decline the hospital defendants' suggestion that we affirm the District Court's holding on the ground that Angelico 
failed to properly define or prove the relevant product and geographic markets because the District Court did not address the 
issue. See Angelico II, 984 F. Supp. at 313 (assuming for the purposes of the limited motion for summary judgment that the 
relevant product market was ""cardiothoracic surgical services"" and that the relevant geographic market was ""the greater Lehigh 
Valley consisting of Carbon, Monroe, Lehigh, Northampton and Schuylkill Counties"")."
485,5," Moreover, a finding of no anticompetitive market effect would not suffice to dispose of Angelico's claim under section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. See Mahone v. Addicks Util. Dist., 836 F.2d 921, 939 (5th Cir. 1988) (""Proving an injury to competition is not an 
element of a monopolization-based antitrust claim.""). It is sufficient to note that it remains for the District Court to further assess 
these issues at the summary judgment stage. See Brader, 64 F.3d at 876 (""The adequacy of a physician's contentions regarding 
the effect on competition is typically resolved after discovery, either on summary judgment or after trial.""). "
486,6," The Pennsylvania Rules of Procedure state: (a) A subpoena is an order of the court commanding a person to attend and testify at a particular time and place. It may

attorney, a party or a representative of the party. Pa. R. Civ. P. 234.1 (emphasis added). "
487,7," Because Angelico has not demonstrated that the attorney defendants were state actors, we need not address the balance of 
the section 1983 analysis. We also reject Angelico's claim that his due process rights were violated by the attorney defendants' 
actions in regards to the subpoenas. Finally, we reject Angelico's allegation that the District Court engaged in improper fact 
finding. This allegation apparently refers to the District Court's understanding that no actual state officials were called upon to 
enforce the subpoenas in the Toonder litigation. However, the District Court was entitled to take judicial notice of the facts of that 
decision. See Oneida Motor Freight, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, 848 F.2d 414, 416 n.3 (3d Cir. 1988); 5A Charles A. Wright & 
Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1364, at 479 n.36 (2d ed. 1990)."
487,8," The original decision stated that the court would award ""modest monetary sanctions"" and required the attorney defendants to 
submit a record of their costs. Upon receiving the submissions, the District Court found that the costs were far greater than it had 
anticipated and elected to award only the $ 1,000. "
488,9," We reject Angelico's assertion that the attorney defendants should have realized that they were not subject to the antitrust 
claims because it implies that the nonfiling side should bear the burden of an allegedly inadvertent pleading mistake. The 
attorney defendants requested that the claims against them be dropped. The fact that the attorney defendants did not 
specifically address the antitrust claims does not serve as an escape hatch for the defendants."
488,10," In addition, the District Court made additional findings of bad faith. In choosing not to sanction Appellant for this other conduct, 
the court doubtless took into account that it was already sanctioning him for the antitrust claims. "

497,9," See United States v. All Star Industries, 962 F.2d 465, 474 (1st Cir. 1992) (in a per se violation case, the government has the 
burden to prove ""that defendants knowingly and intentionally joined that agreement"")."
497,10," See Nippon, 109 F.3d at 9 (holding ""that Section One of the Sherman Act applies to wholly foreign conduct which has an 
intended and substantial effect in the United States.""). "
498,11," See 19 U.S.C. ยง 1673. Dumping is determined by evaluating the price charged in the United States with the price in the home 
market, suitably adjusting for ""costs, charges, and expenses incurred as a result of exporting the goods from the home country 
to the United States."" NSK Ltd. v. United States, 115 F.3d 965, 969 (Fed.Cir. 1997)."
498,12," There was the aroma of a setup in all of this by the American companies seeking not just to eliminate their Japanese rival's 
competitive edge, but to eliminate their Japanese rivals entirely. One of the attendees at the March 30, 1990, meeting, KSK, was 
the parent company of Kanzaki Speciality Papers (KSP), an American company. (KSP was considered to be an American 
corporation for anti-dumping purposes). Hirosuke Fukuda, a KSP vice president, testified that he used KSK to get information 
about Japanese prices; KSK in turn directed its American company, KSP, to join with Appleton and threaten to file an anti-
dumping petition. That, in turn, would force the Japanese companies to raise their prices and push them out of the market. "
499,13," For example, Mr. Ito of MIC (the American trading house) writes to MC (the Japanese trading house) in June of 1990: ""Under 
the current environment, for whatever reasons this is not a market under which we can accept a price increase. I also don't think 
there would be a general price increase with the concern for dumping as Mitsubishi explains. If Mitsubishi needed to raise prices 
somehow (for public consumption) because of dumping, they can find a technical solution that would keep the actual prices with 
no change . . ."" ""Either way, under the current circumstances I have to say that an actual price increase is impossible, and accordingly we must 
use an actual price <support> measure for at least the July production (if necessary I will consent to a separate public pricing). 
For August and beyond I would like to meet with Ichida Department Chief [from the manufacturer, Mitsubishi Paper Mills] when 
he visits the US. Please confirm."" Another official of a trading company, Mr. McCall of DaiEi Papers U.S.A., distributor of Honshu 
products, peppered the manufacturers with letters and faxes urging them not to raise prices because of the market conditions."
499,14," NPI claimed that this change represented a material variance between the government's price-fixing indictment, and its price 
stabilization proof, and moved for a mistrial. While I denied the motion, on reflection I believe the ruling was in error. The 
indictment suggested a simple theory -- an agreement to increase prices and its implementation. Even the government's opening 
reflected this approach. The defense defended, in part, on the grounds that may prices in fact declined after the March 30 
meeting. A price stabilization theory concedes that, but suggests that prices would have declined more had there been no 
agreement. In the light of that issue, one can envision a different defense -- significantly with expert witnesses, perhaps different 
cross examination. The issue, however, is mooted by the instant order. "
500,15," It is commonplace to talk about how fact finders are asked to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence based on their 
""shared perceptions"" and their common understanding of the ""habits, practices, and inclinations of human beings."" United States 
v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992). Here American ""shared perceptions"" and the common understandings of the 
significance of particular acts may well be at odds with the meaning given those acts in Japan. To the extent that this was so, it 
was incumbent upon NPI to present evidence to that effect to the jury."
500,16," A government witness, Andy McCall of DaiEi, testified that in Japanese, ""sentences often don't have a subject, but at the 
beginning [of the text] the subject is identified, and then in subsequent sentences . . . the subject would not be repeated."" An 
interpreter would be obliged to infer who the subject is. Moreover, he noted that Japanese history is ""longer than our history is. 
So there's some shared values that the Japanese have and are understood through history, culture and language."" Sometimes 
those values are implied, ""written between the lines,"" and can be difficult to understand for a non-native."
500,17," The defense insisted that the co-conspirators under the rule had to be either named in the indictment, or had to have qualified 
for that designation under the substantive law of conspiracy. Since the Japanese trading houses would not have qualified under 
Monsanto Company v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), NPI argues, the 
statements and faxes from these companies must be excluded. The law with respect to co-conspirator hearsay, however, is not coterminous with the substantive criminal law. See United States 
v. Carter 966 F. Supp. 336, 346 (E.D.1997). Under the circumstances, I found that there was sufficient evidence to meet the 
Petrozziello standard: Many of the documents which tended to prove the existence of a conspiracy had an independent non 
hearsay basis - records of regularly conducted activity under F.R.E. Rule 803(6), or statements against interest under F.R.E. 
Rule 806(b)(3). These included the critical memoranda with respect to the March 30, 1990, meeting of the alleged co-
conspirators, as well as documents suggesting price increases to at least certain Jujo customers. In addition, there was testimony concerning non-assertive conduct, notably the presence of a Jujo representative at crucial 
meetings in February and March, who, according to Mr. Hinoki, made no objections to what was being said. In some instances, 
the contested co-conspirator statement was not offered for its truth at all. In order to rebut NPI's claim that the prices charged in 
the United States were the product of independent negotiating between customers and trading houses, and trading houses and 
the manufacturers, rather than the manufacturers' orders, the government sought to introduce the fact that efforts to increase "
501,," prices in some instances followed a communication with the manufacturer or Japanese trading house alerting the American 
trading companies to the March 30 agreement. Moreover, it was significant that these statements - offered de bene or for a non 
hearsay statement - corroborated each other as I noted: ""Where there are 15 statements from independent co-conspirators[,] 
one argument is that the facial consistency of all the co-conspirators' statements is independent evidence."" See United States v. 
Garner, 837 F.2d 1404, 1415 (7th Cir. 1987) (""The remarkable consistency with which payments were made [to inspectors] and 
the fact that the inspectors raised the standard fee almost simultaneously from $ 10 to $ 20 suggests that the inspectors were 
communicating with each other and encouraging each other to raise the fee."") In this regard, I am not specifically weighing the 
content of the statements -- only that they are consistent with each other. Where the standard for proving the existence of a conspiracy and the defendant's participation in it is by a preponderance of the 
evidence, I concluded that the evidence was sufficient. Where the standard is more rigorous, and where the evidence concerns 
the continuation of that conspiracy into the fall of 1990, I have come to a different conclusion."
501,18," Hinoki's testimony was so important to the government that it sought to take his testimony via video teleconferencing. The 
testimony was taken each evening at 6:00 p.m. Boston time, and 7:00 a.m. Tokyo time. See Memorandum and Order, July 28, 
1998."
501,19," The government improperly sought to impeach Mr. Hinoki, its own witness, by suggesting that he had earlier given the AUSAs 
and their paralegals different stories, more favorable to the government. The examination was entirely impermissible. The 
government refused to allow the defense to use its ""rough notes"" of its meeting with Mr. Hinoki to cross-examine, but it had no 
problem using them. The AUSA repeatedly asked Mr. Hinoki questions beginning with, ""Didn't you tell me [such and such] when 
I met with you . . ."" See United States v. Shoupe, 548 F.2d 636, 643 (6th Cir. 1977)(holding that ""recitation by the prosecutor of 
the entire substance of a witness's disavowed, unsworn prior statements, which, if credited by the jury, would be sufficient to 
sustain a conviction, abridged defendants' right to a fair trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment.""). 
See also United States v. Zackson, 12 F.3d 1178, 1185 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied 512 U.S. 1224 (1994)(excluding testimony of 
a government witness where the government's proffer indicated that the witness would offer no probative testimony and was 
using the witness only as a conduit to get potentially prejudicial hearsay before the the jury.) "
502,20," NPI tries to advance another legal argument in this context as well, namely that meeting to discuss how to respond to an anti-
dumping suit is not illegal. However, NPI misreads the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which only exempts joint efforts to influence 
political or judicial decision makers from anti-trust laws. See McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 F.2d 1552, 1558-59 (11th Cir. 
1992). There is no evidence that the meeting on March 30, 1990, was aimed at formulating a litigation strategy or starting a 
political action campaign. The Funabashi report, according to the inferences the government would have a jury draw, deals only 
with a price-fixing strategy, and that is not allowed under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine."
502,21," In Mr. Funabashi's report of the March 30 meeting, the government translated one phrase as expressing Honshu's intent to 
""cooperate"" with the industry. The defense offered an alternative - ""to keep up with"" or ""to go along with."" The witness conceded 
that the Japanese translation of that particular word was very ambiguous."
502,22," On cross-examination of the trading house representatives, NPI showed that the prices actually tended to fall when they were 
supposed to be rising or at least stabilizing. I deal with this primarily in the context of the general abandonment of the 
conspiracy, infra, but it could also serve as evidence of competition in what was a buyers' market. "
503,23," The government also cites a report generated on April 5, 1990, by Mr. Watanabe of ""Mr. Fax,"" one of Honshu's customers. 
The report said that he was ""suddenly"" visited by three people, one of whom was Mr. Motoyama, the manager responsible for 
Oji's sales of thermal fax paper to the United States market. According to Mr. Watanabe, Mr. Motoyama stated that the ""mills 
have decided [on a] new export price at [the] meetings of last week"" and that ""Oji has announced [a] new price by 10% 
increase."" This report is particularly noteworthy given that Mr. Motoyama was a named attendee at the meeting on February 1, 
and that his firm, Oji, was represented at both the February 6 and March 30 meetings. "
504,24," As noted above, NPI contests the translation of ""Sando"" as ""agreement."" For purposes of this motion, I am obliged to accept 
the government's version. "
505,25," Initially, the government's translator suggested ""group leader,"" while NPI's translator suggested ""moderator."" The 
government's translator then adopted the latter translation. "
507,26," KSK (the Japanese parent to KSP, the American company working with Appleton Paper) reported that based on the data it 
was analyzing, Jujo and the others were ""dumping"" paper in the American market in June of 1990 -- when Appleton wrote to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan, as well as in August of 1990."
507,27," A telex sent from DaiEi Papers, New Jersey, to DaiEi, San Francisco, simply reports a thermal paper manufacturer's meeting 
at which MPM reported Appleton's threat to file an anti-dumping petition Oji and Daio. The tone of this report and its content is 
wholly different from the March 30 Funabashi memorandum. Likewise, a fax between Mitsui trading houses, confirms that what 
was happening was not the lock-step participation in a price-fixing conspiracy, but rather a company struggling to discount prices 
while avoiding dumping charges. The only evidence the government has for the fall of 1990 is that there was continued talk 
among manufacturers about a threatened anti-dumping petition, which is hardly illegal. Indeed, to the extent that those threats 
hung in the air, they suggested that there were no contrived price increase or price stabilization. For the threats to be credible, 
prices had to be quite low. "
509,28," I warned the government that ""it appears that the government is prepared to take its chances . . . that its proof would be . . . so 
clear that it necessarily produces substantial effects or it will be domestic enough that the jurisdiction issue will be beside the 
point. If the government wants to take its chances that that's the nature of the proof, then I will reserve this issue until trial, until 
at the conclusion . . . on a directed verdict. . . ."" "
510,29," NPI claims that ""Japanese manufacturers lacked sufficient market power, as a matter of law, to cause a substantial effect on 
United States commerce."" In support of this claim, it offers the following quote from Areeda: ""Most recent cases dismiss cases 
as a matter of law where the defendant's market share is less than 50 percent."" This quote is taken from P 801, but P 801 deals 
with ยง 2 of the Sherman Act, not ยง 1. It's concern with ""substantial"" market share is with what it takes to be a monopoly. This has 
no bearing on what is required to have a substantial share of the market under the per se plus test for foreign price-fixing. "
516,1," The exclusivity was product-limited, meaning that a distributor could agree to sell a competitor's product in one product line 
while promoting IDEXX product in other lines. According to CDC, distributors feared that IDEXX would retaliate against a CDC 
distributor by withholding a broad range of other products; but the magistrate judge found ""no admissible evidence in the record 
which would support such a proposition."" CDC Technologies, 7 F. Supp. 2d at 129. "
517,2," In a portion of the statute not excerpted here, it also proscribes certain leases. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 14."
517,3," The distributors do resell IDEXX ""consumables,"" which are the chemical reagents used with each test and proprietary to a 
given machine. But CDC is not basing its exclusive dealing claim on the sale of these consumables. See CDC Technologies, 7 
F. Supp. 2d at 126 (""CDC claims that the product-market definition should be comprised solely of in-clinic hematology analyzers 
for use by veterinarians."" (emphasis added)). In any event, CDC concedes that the market for consumables is completely 
derivative of the analyzer market, see Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 15 n.15 (describing ""razor and razor blade concept""), and 
IDEXX did not require its distributors to stop selling CDC's consumables, only its machines. "
518,4," Assuming the plaintiff succeeds in making this showing, the defendant must establish the ""pro-competitive redeeming virtues"" 
of the practice. See K.M.B. Warehouse, 61 F.3d at 127 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the defendant is successful, the 
plaintiff must then demonstrate ""that the same pro-competitive effect could be achieved through an alternative means that is less 
restrictive of competition."" Id. Because we conclude that CDC fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact on its initial 
showing, we do not reach the second and third steps of the analysis. "
519,5," CDC claims that distributors considering a switch to CDC would be intimidated by fear that IDEXX would cut them off from 
other IDEXX products (e.g., not just hematology analyzers). The magistrate judge concluded that CDC adduced no admissible 
evidence on this point, see CDC Technologies, 7 F. Supp. 2d at 129, a conclusion that CDC does not challenge on appeal. "
520,6," The magistrate judge initially noted that CDC's ยง 2 claim fails a fortiori because CDC could not establish the less demanding 
Clayton Act cause of action. See id. at 130 (citing Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 335, 81 S. Ct. at 632). As noted previously, we do 
not rely on that rule. Notwithstanding the invocation of the Tampa Electric short-cut, however, the magistrate judge went on to 
provide independent analysis of the ยง 2 claims. See 7 F. Supp. 2d at 130-31. It is on that portion of the opinion that we affirm. "
531,1," Plaintiff does not appeal the dismissal, by summary judgment, of its the Lanham Act claims against the APMA. "
533,2," Plaintiff points to evidence in the record where a witness testified that purported meant ""not genuine,"" and the gist of plaintiff's 
argument is that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the statement was literally false. Whether or not a statement 
is ambiguous would seem to be a question of law, as it is in contract interpretation. See, e.g., Astor v. International Bus. 
Mach. Corp., 7 F.3d 533, 539-40 (6th Cir. 1993) (under Ohio law, determination of whether a contractual term is ambiguous is a 
question of law, not fact). On the other hand, the Second Circuit has held that whether or not a statement is facially false is a 
question of fact.  Johnson & Johnson, Inc. v. GAC Int'l, Inc., 862 F.2d 975, 979 (2d Cir. 1988). These two rules do not conflict 
because determining what meaning(s) words facially convey requires no weighing of evidence, while determining whether facts 
exist so as to make a statement true does require weighing evidence. Thus, the initial determination concerning whether a 
statement is ambiguous is a matter of law, while the determination as to whether facts exist so as to justify the statement is a 
question of fact. The testimony plaintiff points to concerns the initial determination of ambiguity and is therefore irrelevant to the 
question of whether ""purporting"" is ambiguous, a question of law. "
534,3," One of the initial difficulties with plaintiff's case is that the persons allegedly deceived by defendants' statements are not 
consumers of any podiatrist certification board. The persons who purchase the services of plaintiff and the ABPS are podiatrists, 
yet plaintiff alleges that hospitals, health care providers, and insurance companies were misled. Plaintiff's focus upon these other 
entities is logical because how they perceive the plaintiff will have an effect on its ability to attract podiatrists seeking certification. 
The less respect these entities have for plaintiff's certification, the less likely it will be that podiatrists will seek plaintiff's 
certification. Because we affirm the district court's grant of the ABPS's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on other 
grounds, we need not decide whether Lanham Act ""consumers"" may be entities that do not actually purchase plaintiff's product. 
We will assume, for purposes of argument, that plaintiff has correctly alleged that hospital administrators and insurance 
companies are its Lanham Act consumers. "
536,4," Because Michigan antitrust law follows federal precedents, our reasoning regarding the federal antitrust claims applies equally 
to the state antitrust claims. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. ยง 445.784(2) (1998) (""It is the intent of the legislature that in construing 
all sections of this act, the courts shall give due deference to interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable antitrust 
statutes . . . .""). HN11[
] - "
537,5," The district court did not reach the question of whether the alleged agreements, if proved, violated the antitrust laws, as it ruled 
that there was insufficient evidence of such agreements to generate a genuine issue of material fact. We also do not reach this 
question."
537,6," Some of plaintiff's allegations are unsupported by the cited evidence in the record. According to plaintiff, in August, 1987, the ABPS and the APMA met to discuss a joint mass mailing targeting competing 
certifying boards. At this alleged meeting, the APMA agreed to assist the ABPS by providing a letter reaffirming the monopoly 
status of the ABPS, a letter which the ABPS could use in its mailings to hospitals and insurance companies. Also, plaintiff 
alleges that after the October, 1993, mailing, the ABPS complained to the APMA that the October mailing did not demonstrate 
sufficiently ardent support for the ABPS. After a consultation, the APMA reached an agreement with the ABPS and in December, 
1993, sent a second letter. To further satisfy the ABPS, the APMA included in the second mass mailing a new CPME brochure, 
also coordinated with the ABPS, which highlighted the ABPS and two other APMA-approved non-surgical boards. Most of these allegations are unsupported by the parts of the record cited by plaintiff. Plaintiff indicates neither evidence of a 
1987 meeting where the ABPS and APMA met to discuss a joint mailing nor of a letter confirming the monopoly status of the 
ABPS. Likewise, plaintiff indicates no evidence of a 1993 complaint by the ABPS, consultation between the ABPS and the "
538,," APMA, or efforts to placate the ABPS. Apparently ABPS executive director John Bennet reviewed the brochure, but nothing 
indicates that Bennet had any control over its final publication. Plaintiff gives this court no reason to think the brochure was not 
sent on the APMA's own initiative."
538,7," Plaintiff relies upon Federal Trade Comm'n v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 
(1986), in which the Supreme Court considered a Federal Trade Commission ruling that the Indiana Federation of Dentists had 
conspired with its own members in violation of the antitrust laws. The Court did not consider whether the Federation could 
conspire with its own members, but stated that the conspiracy it examined was one amongst the members of the Federation. 
476 U.S. at 455."
538,8," Some courts employ the independent personal stake exception to the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, thereby allowing 
members of professional organization to conspire with that organization. See Poindexter v. American Bd. of Surgery, Inc., 
911 F. Supp. 1510 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (applying the rule that where the organization's agents have a personal stake in the 
principal's anticompetitive acts, the agents may be considered separate legal entities and may conspire with the organization). 
This court declined to adopt the independent personal stake exception in Nurse Midwifery. 918 F.2d at 615 (""We are not 
convinced that an agent acting with anticompetitive motives due to some independent personal stake raises sufficient antitrust 
concerns to warrant abandoning the traditional rule that a principal cannot conspire with one of its agents.""). Because the ABPS 
is controlled by its members and presumably acts in their interests, there is little reason to recognize the ABPS as a legal entity 
separate from its members for antitrust purposes. "
540,9," Plaintiff's claims of illegal monopolization and attempted monopolization under the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act must likewise 
survive summary judgment, while the state conspiracy to monopolize claims must fail. "
545,1," Specifically, the Court found that the challenged provision violated section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 
ยงยง 158(b)(4), (e), and sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 et seq. See Memorandum-Decision & Order 
at 26, 30. "
547,2," The Court notes that attorney Barriere was an experienced associate prior to January 1, 1999, at which time he became a 
partner. "
563,1," As the Complaint explains, the ""haircut"" is a discount that represents ""an amount calculated to protect the buyer/lender against 
adverse market movements should the security have to be liquidated to cover the seller/borrower's obligation to repurchase the 
security."" Compl. P 55. "
566,2," It is worth noting that, as of this opinion's issuance, the LAB will already have had access to a significant amount of discovery 
material in this action and related actions. While discovery may not be complete, and this opportunity to conduct discovery does 
not change the Court's analysis of the LAB's claims, the LAB has already had access to a vast quantity of information from which 
it could prepare coherent claims. "
567,3," As the Second Circuit recognized some time ago, HN15[
] an antitrust plaintiff's own injuries must be causally linked to the 
antitrust violation(s): The statutory requirement [of section 4 of the Clayton Act] that treble damage suits be based on injuries which occur ""by 
reason of"" antitrust violations expressly restricts the right to sue under this section. There must be a causal connection 
between an antitrust violation and an injury sufficient for the trier of fact to establish that the violation was a ""material cause"" 
of or a ""substantial factor"" in the occurrence of damage. And this connection must also link a specific form of illegal act to a 
plaintiff engaged in the sort of legitimate activities which the prohibition of this type of violation was clearly intended to 
protect. Billy Baxter, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 431 F.2d 183, 187 (2d Cir. 1970). "
568,4," In its First Amended Complaint, the LAB alleged only that ""nationwide competition and trade were injured, unreasonably 
restrained, and eliminated in relevant markets under the Sherman Act,"" First Amend. Compl. P 214, and that the Brokers' acts 
""restrained competition within the State of New York."" Id. 221."
568,5," As the Ninth Circuit has observed, a plaintiff's failure to establish anticompetitive effect constitutes a failure to establish any 
violation of the antitrust laws whatsoever, and thus renders superfluous any discussion of antitrust standing or injury under 
section 4 of the Clayton Act: We need not decide whether appellants have met the requirements for antitrust standing, because they have failed to 
establish any violation of the antitrust laws. . . . As Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp have observed: HN16[
] When a court concludes that no violation has occurred, it has no occasion to consider [antitrust] standing โฆ . An 
increasing number of courts, unfortunately, deny standing when they really mean that no violation has occurred. In 
particular, the antitrust injury element of standing demands that the plaintiff's alleged injury result from the threat to 
competition that underlies the alleged violation. A court seeing no threat to competition in a rule-of-reason case may 
then deny that the plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury and dismiss the suit for lack of standing. Such a ruling would be 
erroneous, for the absence of any threat to competition means that no violation has occurred and that even suit by the 
government -- which enjoys automatic standing -- must be dismissed."
568,2," Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 360f, at 202-03 (rev. ed. 1995) โฆ . The Sherman Act requires, 
at a minimum, that appellants prove that the PAC-10's actions had an anticompetitive effect. It is on this showing that 
appellants' claim fails, and accordingly we decide this case on the merits. Hairston v. Pacific 10 Conference, 101 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir. 1996). While the LAB's failure to adequately plead the anticompetitive effects of the Brokers' bidding conspiracy renders any discussion 
of antitrust injury under section 4 of the Clayton act unnecessary, the LAB's failure to plead antitrust injury is nevertheless 
noteworthy as an alternate basis for decision. "
570,6," Setting aside the absence of any plausibly-asserted causal connection between the deemed sales and the market injuries 
alleged, the LAB has failed to even allege that the Brokers' resales in the secondary market for CMOs were the driving force 
behind the general decline of CMO prices. The LAB certainly has not alleged that the Brokers were the only, or even the 
primary, entities unloading CMOs into the soft market in 1994, or that their secondary market sales even set the prices for other 
market participants."
570,7," The Complaint makes plain the secondary traders' concerns about taking on a large inventory of esoteric CMOs, which they 
expected to behave bullishly and thus decline under then-existing market conditions. Compl. P 247. The Complaint also makes 
plain the concerns that the secondary traders could be expected to have about being charged with any losses from resales of 
those CMOs. Indeed, according to the LAB these very concerns gave the Brokers the motive to engage in a collusive bidding 
scheme. Compl. P 248. The LAB's opposition papers make this point as well. As the LAB states: The Brokers argue that the Funds' theory makes no sense -- that even if the Brokers succeeded in obtaining the CMOs at 
below-market prices, they should have sold them for as much as they could earn. This argument ignores the Brokers' 
alleged desire to dispose of the CMOs quickly to reduce their exposure, which cut against any desire to hold out for the 
best resale price. The Complaint explains that the traders were afraid of assuming responsibility for a large volume of 
liquidated CMOs and that they had confidence in their hedging activity (as a protection against interest rate changes) only if 
they were able to dispose of the bulk of the acquired securities quickly. (Pls.' Mem. Law Opp. Mots. Part. Dismiss at 23.) Because the Brokers would have this very same interest in a quick liquidation 
even had they obtained the CMOs at market prices, the LAB's contention that the flooding of the market for those instruments 
was a result of the Brokers' collusion is highly questionable."
570,8," To be sure, the LAB does not explicitly make this point as such. However, the Complaint provides all the necessary raw 
material. First, the Complaint alleges that interest rates rose in February and March of 1994, immediately preceding the 
liquidations that are the subject of this lawsuit, and that the Funds therefore experienced an erosion of value. Compl. PP 7, 139-
40. Second, the Complaint alleges that the Funds were in possession of a large number of high-risk instruments sensitive to 
interest rate changes, and that Brokers sold the Funds inappropriately ""bullish"" instruments -- that could be expected to 
decrease in value when interest rates rise. Compl. PP 31-37, 43-44, 47, 50, 80-84, 112. Assuming the truth of the Complaint's 
allegations, one could hardly expect anyone -- let alone the Broker defendants -- to be enthused at the market prospects for 
bullish instruments during the interest rate environment of March 1994. The Complaint indicates that the Brokers were, in fact, 
concerned about the prospects of holding onto bullish securities that would ""decline in value in the then-existing market

571,9," In fact, the Complaint itself notes that ""Bear Stearns' secondary market traders, including Rubin, were concerned that if they 
acquired the Funds' portfolio at fair market value, they would be unable to liquidate such a large portfolio in a short time, without 
suffering trading losses that would be charged to their trading desk."" Compl. P 154. While the Brokers' desires to recover gains on resales of distressed CMOs may well have motivated them to engage in collusive 
bidding practices, this allegation of motive alone does not establish any causal link between that bidding and the market's 
response to the subsequent liquidation."
571,10," Monopsony is to the supply side of a market what monopoly is to the demand side. See Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. Harrison, 
Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297, 306 (1991). As Professors Blair and Harrison have observed: Monopsony power involves the ability of buyers to lower input prices below competitive levels, which requires the ability to 
restrict the quantity demanded of the input. In either case, the quantity that would be exchanged is less than the quantity 
exchanged under competitive conditions, and the result is allocatively inefficient. Ironically, the reduced input prices the 
monopsonist enjoys do not lead to reduced output prices. In fact, when the monopsonist has market power in its output 
market, the reduced input prices cause higher output prices. Id. "
572,11," The consent judgment and stipulation between Salomon Brothers and the United States arising out of the same basic set of 
facts as the Three Crown case, which the LAB has invoked for its own purposes, also reveals the marked differences between 
the Salomon ""squeeze"" and the instant case. The consent stipulation indicates that ""the alleged conspiracy affected the price of 
the notes in the secondary market . . . and the interest rate paid by persons, such as Solomon, that lent the notes in exchange 
for cash."" 57 Fed. Reg. 29,743, 29,744 (July 6, 1992). As the consent stipulation further states: This scheme had the effect of limiting the supply of May two-year notes available in the secondary and financing markets, 
thereby ensuring that persons who had sold May two-year notes short in the when-issued market could obtain such notes 
only by purchasing them at artificially high and non-competitive prices in the secondary market or by borrowing them in 
exchange for cash at artificially low and non-competitive special rates in the financing market. This course of conduct 
continued for a period of time during which Salomon and its co-conspirators earned supracompetitive rates on transactions 
in the notes that are the subject of this action. Id. at 29,745. "
575,12," According to the DLJ defendants, while ""Askin may have been the Funds' agent for some purposes,"" in sending the October 
letter he ""acted not on behalf of the Funds, but to facilitate Whitehead/Sterling's performance of its duties to the Funds under the 
Investment Advisory Agreements."" Resolution of this disputed agency issue, however, would not be appropriate on a motion to 
dismiss. "
576,13," DLJ claims that ""the LAB's claim that the Dealers were contractually obligated to provide valuations to the Funds is obviated 
by the contract between ACM and the Funds upon which the LAB premises its tortious interference claim in Count XI."" 
(DLJ/Comerford Mem. Law. Supp. Mot. Part. Dismiss at 20-21.) "
577,14," Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns have challenged the applicability of In re Mareca, given that a copy of a signed, written 
agreement was actually supplied in opposition papers by the plaintiff in that case. However, the In re Mareca court specifically "
578,," rejected that plaintiff's attempt to supplement the pleadings with the written agreement. See 129 B.R. at 374 (""Richman . . . 
proposes to prove that the agreement described in the Second Claim is reflected in a writing and forms the basis for his claim โฆ 
. However, this court will not consider matters outside the complaint in the context of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).""). The court also 
based its decision not on the written agreement, but on the conclusions that could be drawn from the face of the complaint. See 
id. (""Accordingly, apart from the fact that plaintiff, Richman, submitted a copy of the written agreement with his answering papers 
on this motion, the complaint sufficiently asserts a claim against the debtor and affords him an opportunity to present any 
objections, including the statute of frauds defense."")."
578,15," The letter to Bear Stearns states: ""Please acknowledge your receipt of and agreement with the terms of this letter by signing in

585,17," For example, the Complaint omits any allegation that Askin and ACM ""had committed themselves to making extensive use of 
proprietary computerized models to analyze CMOs by modeling cash flows, prepayment expectations, and yields across 
numerous interest rate scenarios."" (Id. P 67.) The Complaint also omits other details of ACM's nonfeasance, a catalogue of 
which is unnecessary. HN40[
] Because an amended pleading supersedes the original pleading, facts not incorporated in the amended pleading are 
generally considered functus officio. See Kelley v. Crosfield Catalysts, 135 F.3d 1202, 1204-05 (7th Cir. 1998); Barris v.

case, the LAB's prior allegations have not been relied upon in deciding the instant motions to dismiss. "
588,18," As the Second Circuit implicitly recognized in Charles Hughes & Co., the shingle theory was emphatically the result of federal 
regulation of securities markets, and of the SEC's interpretation of the securities laws: We need not stop here to decide, however, how far common-law fraud was shown. For the business of selling investment 
securities has been considered one peculiarly in need of regulation for the protection of the investor. . . . . . . The essential objective of securities legislation is to protect those who do [not] know market conditions from the 
overreachings of those who do. Such protection will mean little if it stops short of the point of ultimate consequence, 
namely, the price charged for the securities. Indeed, it is the purpose of all legislation for the prevention of fraud in the sale 
of securities to preclude the sale of 'securities which are in fact worthless, or worth substantially less than the asking price.' 
People v. Federated Radio Corp., 244 N.Y. 33, 40 154 N.E. 655, 658. If after several years of experience under this highly 
publicized legislation we should find that the public cannot rely upon a commission-licensed broker not to charge 
unsuspecting investors 25 per cent more than a market price easily ascertainable by insiders, we should leave such 
legislation little more than a snare and a delusion. We think the Commission has correctly interpreted its responsibilities to 
stop such abusive practices in the sale of securities."
588,139, F.2d at 437-38. 
589,19," To the extent that the LAB's fraud claim based on excessive markups would be dependant on such a showing, the Complaint's 
allegations concerning the Brokers' awareness of the Funds' reliance are deficient. Consequently, even were the Court to decide 
that a quasi-shingle theory claim is available under New York law, Count V of the LAB's Complaint would be dismissed. "
590,20," A prerequisite to any tortious interference claim by the LAB would, of course, be some actual breach of a contract. See 
Robins v. Max Mara, U.S.A., Inc., 923 F. Supp. 460, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (""HN46[
] 'In order for the plaintiff to have a cause 
of action for tortious interference of contract, it is axiomatic that there must be a breach of that contract by the other party.'"") 
(quoting Jack L. Inselman & Co. v. FNB Fin. Co., 41 N.Y.2d 1078, 1080, 396 N.Y.S.2d 347, 349, 364 N.E.2d 1119, 1120 (1977)). 
The LAB has failed to adequately allege that any contract between ACM and the Funds was actually breached by the Brokers' 
provision of inaccurate marks. A review of an investment advisory agreement between ACM and Quartz, appropriately 
considered given the LAB's reference to the advisory agreements in the Complaint and presumed access to such a foundational 
document, reveals no explicit requirement whatsoever that ACM or any other advisor provide the Funds with Broker marks. Nowhere does the LAB indicate how the Brokers' provision of false marks would result in any real breach of the investment 
advisory agreements, or provide any contractual language that supports its assertions."
590,21," HN47[
] To maintain a claim for tortious interference with contracts, a plaintiff must also allege that the defendant intended to 
interfere with a contract. See G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v. Honickman, 55 F.3d 762, 768 (2d Cir. 1995); Gruntal & Co. v. San Diego 
Bancorp, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8583, No. 94 Civ. 5366 (DC), 1996 WL 343079, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 1996). In their papers, 
the parties have jousted over whether or not a plaintiff must plead ""exclusive malicious motivation"" -- that the interference was 
for the sole purpose of harming the plaintiffs, rather than merely for the defendant's own economic gain. See Elliott Assocs., L.P. 
v. Republic of Panama, 975 F. Supp. 332, 341-42 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); Rapp Boxx, Inc. v. MTV, Inc., 226 A.D.2d 324, 325, 642 
N.Y.S.2d 228, 228 (1st Dep't 1996); Benjamin Goldstein Prods., Ltd. v. Fish, 198 A.D.2d 137, 138, 603 N.Y.S.2d 849, 851 (1st 
Dep't 1993). Because the LAB's Complaint does not adequately allege any intent whatsoever, or even the Brokers' awareness of 
any contract requiring the provision of Broker marks, this issue need not be reached. Conclusory allegations that the Brokers acted ""knowingly, intentionally, purposefully, maliciously, and without regard for the 
rights and interests of the Funds,"" are not sufficient pleadings of intent. Compl. P 291. The LAB's vague assertion that ""by virtue "
591,," of their knowledge of ACM's status as a registered investment advisor, or otherwise, the Brokers knew or should have known 
that ACM was a party to investment advisory agreements with each of the Funds and knew or should have known of those 
agreements' terms"" is also patently insufficient. Compl. P 282. Nowhere does the LAB point to any facts indicating awareness on 
the Brokers' part that the advisory agreement required ACM to obtain accurate Broker marks, let alone any language in those 
agreements that even demanded those marks. Further, the LAB's assertion that the Brokers knew of ACM's contractual 
obligation to provide marks to the Funds ""by virtue of the October 28, 1992 Agreements,"" Compl. P 283, is hardly adequate 
given the specific language of the October 28, 1992 letters. Nowhere do the October letters ever state that ACM is contractually 
obligated to provide the Funds with Broker marks. Consequently, even had the LAB successfully pleaded ""but for"" causation, its failure to adequately plead intent would merit 
dismissal."
591,22," Compare First Am. Compl. P 4 (""Bear Stearns, DLJ, and Merrill Lynch . . . were among the principal sellers of CMOs to the 
Funds""), with Compl. P 4 (""Bear Stearns, DLJ, and Merrill Lynch . . . sold CMOs to the Funds""). In Granite II, P 4 of the LAB's 
First Amended Complaint was specifically relied upon by this Court in ruling that the LAB's own pleadings negated any possibility 
of ""but for"" causation: Despite the words ""direct result"" in the Complaint, the facts alleged negate the possibility that the Brokers' alleged actions 
were the ""but for"" cause for the alleged breaches of contract. After all, the LAB maintains that numerous dealers, including 
nonparties, were selling inappropriate securities to the Funds. (See Compl. P 4 (acknowledging that the Brokers were 
""among"" the principal sellers of CMOs to the Funds).). Thus, according to the Complaint, even if ACM had not purchased 
CMOs from each of the Brokers, it would have breached its contractual obligations to the Funds by making purchases from 
other broker-dealers."
591,17," F. Supp. 2d at 292. Despite the LAB's careful pruning of its Complaint, it does not now allege that the Brokers were the only 
sellers of CMOs to the Funds. "
597,*," Honorable Murray M. Schwartz, Senior Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, sitting by 
designation. "
598,1," The Act of Feb. 23, 1996, P.L. 27, 1996 Pa. Laws 10, ยง 9(a) (repealing Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, ยงยง 448.501-448.507), has since 
eliminated the Health Facility Hearing Board and transferred its review functions to the Health Care Policy Board. This change 
does not affect our review of the Surgical Center's appeal. "
600,2," Plaintiff 's allegations that both the threatened boycott and the claimed misrepresentations were intended to secure denial of 
the CON distinguish the situation before us from cases like Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119 (3d Cir. 1999), 
that deal with the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr doctrine. In Cheminor, the defendant, Ethyl, had petitioned the International 
Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, alleging that Cheminor was dumping bulk ibuprofen on the U.S. market 
and seeking the imposition of extra duties to offset the alleged subsidies that enabled it to do so. Although Cheminor withdrew 
from the U.S. market prior to a final decision on Ethyl's petition, it alleged injuries resulting from the petition and brought an 
antitrust suit against Ethyl. In response to Ethyl's reliance on Noerr immunity, Cheminor asserted that the petition was a ""sham"" 
and Noerr immunity thus was unavailable. We analyzed and rejected Cheminor's argument under the teachings of PRE. PRE holds that Noerr immunity is lost when the petition is a ""sham,"" i.e., ""is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable 
government action."" PRE, 508 U.S. at 58. As we noted in Cheminor, PRE further holds that determining whether a petition is a 
sham requires a two-step process. First, the Court determines whether the petition is ""objectively baseless;"" if not, the petition is 
not a sham without regard to the subjective intent of the petitioner. Second, if the petition is objectively baseless (and only if it is 
objectively baseless), the Court is to look to the petitioner's ""subjective motivation"" and determine ""whether the baseless 
[petition] conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor through the use of 
governmental process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetition weapon."" 508 U.S. at 60-61 
(emphasis in original) (quoting Noerr, 365 U.S. at 144, and Omni, 499 U.S. at 380). Cheminor holds that where the petitioning effort allegedly involves misrepresentations, the Court, at the first step, must 
""determine whether [the] petition was objectively baseless under[PRE] without regard to those facts that the [plaintiff] alleges [the 
petitioner] misrepresented."" Cheminor, 168 F.3d at 123 (emphasis in original). Such a determination is unnecessary here, 
however, because the plaintiff affirmatively alleges that defendants' purpose was to secure the outcome of the process -- denial 
of the CON. Thus, even if defendants' opposition to the CON were found to be objectively baseless (a conclusion that could not 
be reached on this record), defendants would pass the second, ""subjective"" test and the sham exception to Noerr immunity 
would be inapplicable here. While Cheminor focuses on the sham exception to Noerr immunity, it also rejects Cheminor's more general argument that 
""Noerr-Pennington immunity does not apply at all to petitions containing misrepresentations."" Id. To that extent, it supports the 
conclusion reached below with respect to the misrepresentation claim. "
601,3," While plaintiff also claims ""increased costs, legal and otherwise, in pursuing Plaintiff's application for a CON,"" the referenced 
costs apparently relate to the appeal plaintiff prosecuted from the Board's decision. Plaintiff does not contend that it incurred 
costs at the Board level in excess of the cost it would have incurred had the threat of a boycott (or the alleged 
misrepresentations) not been made. "
603,4," The referenced possible exception relates to state action as a purchaser or seller in the market rather than as a sovereign 
regulator."
603,5," The Court first concluded that the ""sham"" exception to Noerr immunity was inapplicable because that exception ""encompasses 
situations in which persons use the governmental process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetitive 
weapon."" Id. at 380. COA had sought to use only the outcome of the process to suppress competition. "
604,6," The Board's ""need projection formula"" projected a need for 6.5 operating rooms. The Hospital currently had six general 
purpose operating rooms and a room used for ""short procedures"" such as endoscopies, colonoscopies and sigmoidoscopies. If 
and when the Hospital's proposed facility was completed, three of the general purpose operating rooms would be closed and the 
ambulatory surgical services provided in the main building would be provided in the new facility. The Surgical Center proposed 
to add two operating rooms under circumstances where the State Health Plan's need-project formula indicated, at most, need for 
one additional (seventh) operating room. In terms of the population to be served and the surgical services to be rendered, the 
Surgical Center's project would do little other than raise the number of operating rooms in Armstrong County above the limit set 
by the State Health Plan. The Board, therefore, concluded that approval of the instant CON application would result in needless 
duplication of existing facilities and health care services. While the Surgical Center projected a higher need and suggested that 
its facility would serve a larger area than the hospital, the Board found its projections flawed. The opinion of the Commonwealth 
Court establishes that it also understood this to be the basis for the Board's ruling, a basis for which it found support in the 
record."
604,7," We acknowledge that the result we reach is in conflict with the holding of the court in St. Joseph's Hospital v. Hospital Corp. of 
America, 795 F.2d 948 (11th Cir. 1986) and with the analysis of the courts in Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Centers, 146 F.3d 1056 
(9th Cir. 1998) and Potters Medical Center v. City Hospital Ass'n., 800 F.2d 568 (6th Cir. 1986). To the extent of that conflict, we 
respectfully disagree with the views there expressed. We note that the courts in St. Joseph's Hospital and Potters Medical 
Center did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court's 1991 decision in Omni and that Kottle's brief analysis does not reference 
that decision."
604,8," This is not a case like Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Machinery and Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. 
Ct. 347 (1965), or Woods Exploration & Prod. Co., Inc. v. Aluminum Company of America, 438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971). In 
Walker, the state action was the issuance of a patent which allegedly had been procured by fraud. The attempted enforcement 
of the patent against the plaintiff was held actionable under the Sherman Act. The decision making process there was an ex 
parte  one in which the Patent Office was wholly dependent on the applicant for the facts. While the Patent Office can determine 
the prior act from its own records, it effectively and necessarily delegates to the applicant the factual determinations underlying "
605,," the issuance of a patent. Accordingly, when the applicant has submitted false factual information, the state action is dependent 
on financially interested decision making. See Einer Elhauge, Making Sense of Antitrust Petitioning Immunity, 80 Calif. L. Rev. 
1177, 1249 (1992) (suggesting that the immunity exception recognized in Walker is ""very narrow"" and applies only when 
financially interested parties essentially made the factual determinations that triggered the governmental restraint). The same is 
true of the situation in Woods where the Texas Railroad Commission was wholly dependent on the antitrust defendants for the 
factual information on which it predicated its allocation of production from a given field. "
606,1," In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court must accept the well-pleaded facts as true and resolve them in the light most 
favorable to the plaintiff.  Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, Inc. v. Mirage Resorts Inc., 140 F.3d 478, 483 (3d Cir. 1998); Morse v. 
Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997). In addition, the court may consider allegations contained in the 
complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters of public record. See City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 
F.3d 256, 259 (1998); Steinhardt Group, Inc. v. Citicorp, 126 F.3d 144, 145 (3d Cir. 1997). Accordingly, this dissent, like the 
majority, considers both the Board's decision and the Commonwealth Court decision. "
607,2," The Court in Noerr stated: It is inevitable, whenever an attempt is made to influence legislation by a campaign of publicity, that an incidental effect of 
that campaign may be the infliction of some direct injury upon the interests of the party against whom the campaign is 
directed. And it seems equally inevitable that those conducting the campaign would be aware of, and possibly even pleased 
by, the prospect of such injury. To hold that the knowing infliction of such injury renders the campaign itself illegal would 
thus be tantamount to outlawing all such campaigns. "
613,3," The staff physicians defendants eschewed reliance upon Parker state action immunity, stating in the catch line of their 
argument, ""Plaintiff's Attempt to Reframe this Appeal in Terms of State Action Immunity is Misguided. . . ."" Individual Appellee's 
Br. at 20. Further, the Hospital dropped all reference to state action immunity on appeal. Appellee's counsel made a deliberate, "
614,," reasoned choice not to rely on the theory, going so far as to state that ""the correctness of the District Court's decision . . . is not 
accurately analyzed under state action immunity."" Individual Appellee's Br. at 22. Thus, this is not a circumstance where a 
litigant's counsel overlooked a theory. While this Court is not limited by positions advanced by the litigants, caution is warranted 
where capable counsel expressly disavow reliance on a defense. The majority nonetheless has relied upon a state action 
defense explicitly and impliedly discarded by the defendants. "
615,4," It is for this reason that reliance by the majority on Sandy River Nursing Care v. Aetna Casualty, 985 F.2d 1138, 1142 (1st Cir.), 
cert. denied, 510 U.S. 818, 126 L. Ed. 2d 39, 114 S. Ct. 70 (1993), is misplaced. That case involved a decision by a legislature 
to change the law in the face of a boycott. It is impossible to say that the boycott dictated the outcome of the legislature's 
decision."
615,5," The majority's reliance on Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 118 S. Ct. 264 (1997), also is misplaced. There, an unaccredited law school alleged the American Bar Association 
engaged in anticompetitive conduct because graduates from unaccredited schools could not sit for most state bar examinations. 
This Court concluded the source of the injury was the action of each of those states because ""every state retains the final 
authority to set all the bar admission rules."" Id. at 1035. That case is distinguishable from the instant case for two reasons. First, 
the state action in that case was non-adjudicative in nature. Second, and more importantly, the plaintiff made no allegation that 
the ABA knowingly made misrepresentations which were central to each state's actions. "
620,1," We were informed after this decision was handed down, but before publication, that ""in connection with a corporate 
reorganization during the pendency of this litigation, its name was changed to BG plc and the right to use the name British Gas 
plc was assigned to another entity."" "
621,2," The facts in this case are quite extensive, as the parties have been litigating since 1994 on very complex legal and factual 
issues. However, this motion addresses only Miller Pipeline's antitrust claim under the Sherman Act and so we will address facts 
relating to the patent infringement claims and defenses only to the extent necessary to establish a proper background for this 
case and when such facts are relevant to the issue directly before the Court today. "
625,3," It appears that Miller Pipeline at some point contended that the public demonstrations witnessed by Mr. Bowles constitute 
public use prior art, but Miller Pipeline has produced no evidence besides Mr. Bowles' own affidavit. British Gas argues that this 
uncorroborated evidence is insufficient, citing Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. 395, 553 F.2d 69, 75 (Ct. Cl. 
1977): ""Indeed, the oral testimony of witnesses, speaking only from memory in regard to past transactions has, in the absence of 
contemporaneous documentary or physical evidence, consistently been found to be of little probative value . . . . Such 
uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to show anticipation, within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. ยง 102, of an issued patent."" Miller 
Pipeline has not disputed this and so to the extent Miller Pipeline has advanced this argument, we consider it waived or 
abandoned, at least for purposes of this motion. "
626,4," Although this point is ignored by Miller Pipeline, we note that the patent office had the entire text of the Lindsay patent before it 
during the prosecution of the '565 patent and could have read the word ""corrosion"" in the text of the patent that Miller Pipeline 
finds so critical and could have determined independently whether the teachings of the Lindsay patent included cutting non-
malleable pipe. While we recognize that prospective patentees may mislead the patent examiner, it is important to remember 
that British Gas disclosed the Lindsay patent and so the patent examiner had the opportunity to make its own determination, 
rather than relying exclusively on British Gas' representations. We do not need to factor this point into our analysis, primarily 
because Miller Pipeline has failed woefully in its evidentiary burden and because likely it is accounted for in the presumption of 
the validity of the patent, but we find it worthy of note. "
627,5," See, e.g., Kaplan v. Helenhart Novelty Corp., 182 F.2d 311, 314 (2d Cir. 1950): ""The only evidence of bad faith is the 
defendants' failure to sue promptly. But the plaintiffs have continuously had a plain and complete remedy for any wrong done 
them, in that they could have brought this suit whenever they pleased after the first notice was given, instead of waiting as they 
did . . . . Any delay in putting the defendants' asserted rights to the test of actual litigation was, therefore, only what the plaintiffs 
chose to permit . . . . The suit is as timely as they chose to make it."" "
629,6," We do not need to decide whether Dr. Bowles' affidavit in fact creates a genuine issue of material fact about the teachings of 
the Lindsay '302 patent because it is not necessary to determination of the motion presently before the Court. However, we note 
that British Gas challenges Dr. Bowles' affidavit on many grounds, including inadmissible hearsay. "
630,7," Miller Pipeline relies upon Kobe, 198 F.2d at 425, for the proposition that British Gas' activities, taken as a whole, support a 
finding of anticompetitive conduct. We note that the Tenth Circuit in Kobe did find that the patentholder's infringement lawsuit 
and related activities were unlawful because they were intended and designed to further and give effect to an overall 
monopolistic scheme. However, the court expressly stated, ""The infringement action and the related activities, of course, in 
themselves were not unlawful, and standing alone would not be sufficient to sustain a claim for damages which they may have 
caused . . . ."" 198 F.2d at 425. The Kobe court found such activities illegal only in combination with the rest of the patentholder's 
anticompetitive scheme. Here, Miller Pipeline only complains about British Gas' activities related to its infringement notices and 
threats to bring suit and other litigation-related activities and does not identify any broader monopolistic scheme of which these 
activities constitute only a part. Thus, we find that Kobe does not speak to this case. "
635,1," Also listed in the complaint as defendants are ""unknown docketing clerk"" and Rod Lanser. No clerk has ever been identified, 
and no claims are raised regarding Rod Lanser. Thus, we assume that the former Milwaukee County Clerk of Courts is the sole 
defendant in this suit."
635,2," The respondent argued, and the trial court agreed, that ยง 806.10(3)'s legislative history indicates that ""at the proper time"" 
means ""as soon as practicable"" and ""reasonable."" Respondent argued that an analysis of ยง 806.10(3)'s legislative history 
revealed that in the 1800's our legislature passed two laws, which appeared to be overlapping or duplicative, requiring the clerk 
to docket judgments ""as soon as practicable"" and ""at the proper time,"" respectively. The two statutes existed side by side until 
1897 when a revisor's bill eliminated the former. The respondent argued that despite eliminating this section, the revisor did not, 
and could not, intend any substantive change in the statute's meaning. Because the revisor could not have intended any 
substantive change in the statute's meaning, the respondent argued that the two statutes must be interpreted together so that ""at 
the proper time"" means ""as soon as practicable."" The trial court agreed with the respondent that statutory history and ""statutory 
common sense"" dictate that ""at the proper time"" means ""as soon as practicable,"" and the trial court then concluded that ""as soon 
as practicable"" is consistent with ""reasonable."""
635,3," As an initial matter, we decline to address an argument raised by the respondent for the first time on appeal that the docketing 
date is irrelevant because the unrecorded conveyances remain valid against a judgment creditor. The respondent concludes that 
the time of docketing is irrelevant because the unrecorded quitclaim deed executed by Rooney rendered the judgment obtained 
against him ineffective. The respondent concedes that under ยง 706.08(1)(a), Stats., conveyances that are not recorded are void 
against any subsequent good faith purchasers for value; however, the respondent argues that an unrecorded conveyance 
remains valid against a judgment creditor, because a judgment creditor is not a good faith purchaser for value. Because South 
Milwaukee is a judgment creditor, not a good faith purchaser, the respondent concludes that the unrecorded quitclaim deed is 
valid against South Milwaukee and precludes recovery. Therefore, the Respondent reasons, if the judgment itself is ineffective, 
the time that the clerk's office actually docketed the judgment is irrelevant and could not have harmed South Milwaukee. As a general rule, we refuse to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. See Wirth v. Ehly, 93 Wis. 2d 433, 443-44, 
287 N.W.2d 140, 145-46 (1980). The respondent acknowledges that it raises this argument for the first time on appeal but cites 
Johnson v. Seipel, 152 Wis. 2d 636, 449 N.W.2d 66 (Ct. App. 1989), for the proposition that this court may affirm the circuit 
court's decision based on any ground contained in the record. We are satisfied that Seipel is distinguishable on its facts and 
does not allow respondent to raise this issue for the first time on appeal. Further, at oral argument, counsel for South Milwaukee 
asserted that had the respondent raised this argument at trial, South Milwaukee would have challenged the validity of the deeds 
as well as their authenticity. Thus, it would be premature for us to address this issue here. "
636,4," This court takes judicial notice of the fact that the filing clerk's office in the Milwaukee County Clerk of Courts' office closes at 
5:00 p.m. This has been the practice for many years."
636,5," We are advised that under the current computerized system, the judgment is entered and docketed at the same time by the 
same clerk. The clerk's office did not switch to the new system until January of 1995. At the time at issue in this case, both 
systems were in place and the old system was being phased out. The judgment in question was entered and docketed using the 
old manual process. "
639,6," Because we find that South Milwaukee's action is governed by the six-year statute of limitations and the instant action was 
timely filed, we need not determine exactly when South Milwaukee's cause of action accrued. Accordingly, we will not consider 
whether the application of the discovery rule is proper. Cf.  Gross v. Hoffman, 227 Wis. 296, 300, 277 N.W. 663, 665 (1938) 
(holding that if a decision on one point disposes of an appeal, the appellate court need not decide other issues raised)."
639,7, See supra n.2. 
640,8," In addition, we see limited relevance to reports written by the Office that involve suggested docketing practices in Rock and 
Clark Counties, counties significantly smaller than Milwaukee County."
640,9," Further, we observe that the twenty-four hour rule must have been only a suggested practice and not a statutory interpretation 
because the ""rule"" would be certain to be violated over weekends and holidays when judgments are filed in the clerk's office at 
the close of the business day. In addition, the respondent has argued that the judgment was docketed at 9:01 a.m. the morning 
after it was entered, ""within one working hour (or at most two) of its entry."" Counting only ""working hours"" against the twenty-four 
hour rule avoids the problem created by weekends and holidays; however, considered together, the respondent's arguments 
would render ยง 806.10(3), Stats., nearly meaningless. If we are required to afford the clerk's office a twenty-four hour window in 
which to docket judgments, and we may only count working hours in determining whether a judgment was docketed at the 
proper time, the clerk's office would have three working days to docket the judgment. We conclude that such an interpretation is 
overly broad and unreasonable, given the legal significance attached to docketed judgments."
640,10," During the time left in the day, we note that Mrs. Rooney had ample time to go home from the courthouse, retrieve her 
quitclaim deeds, return to the courthouse, and have the deeds recorded before 5:00 p.m. "
641,11," Finally, we decline to address South Milwaukee's argument that the trial court improperly expanded the record without notice 
because that issue is now moot. "
647,1, Separate state court class actions in which class counsel are not involved may be pending in California and Alabama. 
649,2," In a letter to the Court dated January 14, 1999, submitted at the request of the Court, the Attorney General offered the following 
comment on class counsel's fee petition: Consistent with our comments in Ruff v. Parex, 1999 NCBC 6 (96 CVS 0059, New Hanover County), we believe that the 
simplistic percentage-of-the-fund approach suggested by plaintiff's counsel is inappropriate in this type of case. Instead, we 
recommend the multi-factor approach for determining the reasonableness of attorney's fees that the State Bar outlined in its 
Rule 1.5 (1998) as a more accurate means to assure that the attorney's fees are reasonable and not excessive. This 
framework was adopted by Judge Howard Manning in Smith et al. v. State of North Carolina et al. (95 CVS 6715, Wake 
County), by Judge Robert L. Farmer in Faulkenbury v. Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System, et al. (90 CVS 
12090, Wake County), and by this Court in Byers et al. v. Carpenter et al., 1998 NCBC 1 (94 CVS 04489, 96 NCB 103, 
Wake County). "

Elwood, $ 415; Bainbridge, $ 395. The top hourly rate for class counsel paralegals was: Goodkind, $ 145. "

awarded fees at the rate of $ 265 an hour for senior attorneys at Womble Carlyle Sandridge and Rice, a large N.C. law firm. The Court also notes that in In Re Food Lion Effective Scheduling Litigation, No. 92-198-MISC-5-F (E.D.N.C.) (April 13, 1995), 
Judge Fox applied the rate for similar services in the specific locale of Eastern District of North Carolina attorneys in determining 
the proper fee award for class counsel, awarding $ 160 an hour for attorneys and $ 35 an hour for paralegals in an employment 
litigation case. "
668,1," The plaintiffs originally named Retail Business Systems, Inc. (""RBS"") as an additional defendant in this action. On April 1, 1998, 
RBS filed a motion to dismiss. Because the plaintiffs failed to file a memorandum in opposition within twenty-one days of the 
date RBS filed its motion, the court granted the motion to dismiss absent objection on May 11, 1998. See D. Conn. L. Civ. R. 
9(a) (recognizing that the ""failure to submit a memorandum in opposition to a motion may be deemed sufficient cause to grant 
the motion""). The plaintiffs failed to seek timely reconsideration of this ruling. See D. Conn. L. Civ. R. 9(e) (requiring that motions 
for reconsideration be filed ""within ten (10) days of the filing of the decision or order from which such relief is sought"")."

approach to this issue. In Casey, the plaintiffs complained that the defendant tied the sale of its franchise, Diet Center, with the 
sale of certain nutritional products, including ""Diet Supp."" See Casey, 590 F. Supp. at 1563. The plaintiffs argued that equivalent 
nutritional products were available from various other sources for less money. See id. The court found no tying arrangement 
because ""the demand for the Diet Supp is not separate from that for the franchise: it is generated wholly by the franchisee's 
operation of the franchise."" Id. at 1564. Because Casey employs essentially a functional approach to this issue, the court finds it 
unpersuasive. "

Olsten Corp., 506 F.2d 658 (2d Cir. 1974). Neither of these cases supports this proposition. In fact, in Susser the court 
recognized that Carvel dealers ""competed not only with similar chains - - Dairy Queen, Tastee Freez, Dari-Delite, King Kone, 
Dari-Isle, and others, but also with chains and independents utilizing mobile units, with chain stores and operations such [as]

688,2," Regarding the other claims in the 2AC, see section 6(B), infra, titled ""Other Claims."" "
692,3," The Court accepts as correct the methodology for determining a below-cost sale advanced by PREA and PICA witness Robert 
S. Knudsen, a certified public accountant, as he explained: ""In order to assess the profitability to PREA of the Emery franchise, 
the franchise agreement was analyzed over its seven year term [footnote] using the fully allocated cost basis applicable under 
California Business and Professions Code Section 17043. Determination of whether or not the franchise was sold above or 
below cost was made by offsetting the expected franchise revenue to PREA by the costs that PREA would incur directly as a 
result of the services provided to the franchise in addition to other costs that are deducted as a result of the full cost allocation."" 
(See id. at 1970:17-25; emphasis added.) "
693,4," The Court need not consider other evidence from Region V's Opposition's Exhibit 118, the Declaration of former PREA 
President Jerry Cole, that Knudsen underestimated the cost of the Emery deal to PREA by failing to account for certain fixed 
costs. Even assuming Knudsen's cost figures are correct, Region V has demonstrated a genuine issue of fact regarding whether 
the revenue could cover those costs. "
694,5," This mixed evidence of Emery's motive in leaving Region V was sufficient for Region V to withstand the defendants' summary 
judgment motion on count 1, inducement of breach of the Emery contract. There, the Court found that a reasonable jury could 
(but might not) reasonably find that the monetary inducements were the legal cause of Emery's departure from Region V. Here, 
in contrast, the Court has considered something different: whether the evidence affirmatively establishes a legal presumption of 
injurious effect on Region V. The Court should not make this determination merely because a reasonable fact-finder might do so. 
It is the determination of actual purpose of injurious intent which is a mixed question of fact and law, and which would be given to 
the trier of fact if a fact issue existed. Cf.  Mering v. Yolo County Grocery & Meat Market, 127 P.2d 985, 992 (1942) (noting 
different legal standard for presumption of purpose and actual purpose in Unfair Practices Act)."
694,6," The Court need not (but does) consider this other material, which does not appear in the Consolidated Response. See C.D. 
Cal. Local Civ. Rule 7.14.3. "
700,1," In its Statement of Material Facts, Plaintiff asserts that ""Irving's own sales to its Maine entity and direct imports to Maine exceed 
50% during relevant times in this case."" (Pl.'s Statement of Facts P 5.) The Court finds this statement not only undecipherable, 
but unsupported by the portion of the record to which Plaintiff cites."
700,2, These totals reflect Plaintiff's fiscal year which runs from October 1 to September 31. 
701,3," In addition to these substantive requirements, section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act contains a jurisdictional requirement: 
the statute applies only to those discriminatory sales that take place ""in commerce."" See Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Caribbean 
Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir. 1996); see also 1A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovencamp, Antitrust Law P 267c 
(Aspen Law & Business 1997). In the context of a primary-line injury, the ""in commerce"" requirement has been interpreted to 
mean that the product exchanged in at least one of the sales, whether the below-cost sale or the sale to which the below-cost 
sale is being compared, must cross a state line. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 200-201, 42 L. Ed. 2d 
378, 95 S. Ct. 392 (1974); see also Areeda & Hovencamp, supra, P 267c."
701,4," Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's claim does not meet the statute's threshold ""in commerce"" requirement because neither 
the gasoline sold at Defendant's retail stations in Kennebec County at below-cost prices, nor the gasoline sold at its retail 
stations elsewhere in Maine at higher prices, crossed a state line in the course of the sales. Plaintiff responds that Defendant's 
sales of retail gas to its customers in Maine were ""in commerce"" because the gas originated at Irving Limited's refinery in 
Canada. It appears that Plaintiff is relying on an exception, established by the Supreme Court in Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U.S. 231, 
237-38, 95 L. Ed. 239, 71 S. Ct. 240 (1951), to the ""in commerce"" requirement for goods which are sold intrastate, but 
nevertheless remain in the ""flow of commerce."" Cases from other circuits interpreting Standard Oil have found the ""flow of 
commerce"" rationale applies "
702,," (1) Where [goods] are purchased by the retailer upon the order of a customer with the definite intention that the goods are 
to go at once to the customer; (2) where the goods are purchased by the retailer from the supplier to meet the needs of 
specified customers pursuant to some understanding with the customer, although not for immediate delivery; and (3) where 
the goods are purchased by the retailer based on the anticipated needs of specific customers. Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., 417 F.2d 203, 210 (5th Cir. 1969) (citing Walker Oil Co. v. Hudson Oil Co., 414 F.2d 588, 
590 (5th Cir. 1969)). There is no clear First Circuit precedent on this issue. The case cited by Defendant, Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Caribbean 
Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189-90 (1st Cir. 1996), is distinguishable because the refined oil at issue in that case never 
crossed state lines: the oil was refined in Puerto Rico and the relevant sales where made by the refinery to wholesalers in Puerto 
Rico. On the other hand, the case relied upon by Plaintiff, Rio Vista Oil, Ltd. v. Southland Corp., 667 F. Supp. 757 (D. Utah 
1987) has been criticized by a leading commentator in the field and flatly contradicted by the decisions of other courts. See 
Areeda & Hovencamp, supra note 3, P 267c; see also Indiana Grocery Co. v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 647 F. Supp. 254, 261 
(S.D. Ind. 1986) (holding retail sale of groceries not ""in commerce""); Cliff Food Stores, Inc., 417 F.2d at 210 (same). Clearly, the case law regarding the ""in commerce"" requirement is unsettled. The Court declines to reach the issue here, 
however, in light of its finding that Plaintiff has failed to make out a genuine question of material fact as to the substantive 
elements of its price discrimination claim."
702,5," This latter effect, called ""oligopolistic price coordination"" or ""conscious parallelism,"" occurs when firms that share monopoly 
power in a highly concentrated market ""[set] their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their 
shared economic interest and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions."" Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 
227."
702,6," With respect to the first requirement, Plaintiff's Complaint asserts that Defendant instituted its below-cost pricing strategy in 
August of 1995 with the credible intention of putting Plaintiff out of business in Kennebec County. Though Defendant does not 
press the point, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not created a genuine issue of fact as to whether it was adversely affected by 
the below-cost pricing, much less as to whether it was in danger of going out of business. It undisputed that Plaintiff currently operates retail gasoline stations in Winslow, Farmingdale, and Manchester, just as it has 
since 1995, the beginning of the alleged predatory period. Moreover, Plaintiff acknowledges that it opened a new station in 
Augusta in July of 1997. Beyond a bare allegation in the Complaint, there is no indication that these stations have lost money. 
Indeed, the affidavit of William Norwood, Plaintiff's Chief Financial Officer, does nothing to substantiate Plaintiff's claim of lost 
profits, and there is evidence that the volume of retail gas sold in Kennebec County by Plaintiff exceeded that sold by Defendant 
each year from 1995 to 1997. Plaintiff's claim that it requires additional discovery to establish the fact or probability of its own injury is unavailing. Proving such 
injury ""requires an understanding of the extent and duration of the alleged predation, the relative financial strength of the 
predator and its intended victim, and their respective incentives and will."" Brooke Group Ltd, 509 U.S. at 225. Information about 
Plaintiff's own financial strength, incentives and will, if not those of its competitor, are well within Plaintiff's control, yet it has 
produced no evidence of any ill-effect despite four years of alleged predation. The Court thus finds that Plaintiff has failed to 
meet its burden to show that Defendant's below-cost pricing could drive it from the retail gasoline market. Furthermore, the "
703,," suggestion in Plaintiff's brief that Defendant's pricing strategy was intended to discipline Plaintiff to raise its own prices to a 
supracompetitive level within an oligopolistic market also is completely without support. "
711,1," Fred Nichols of Anatech, Inc. did not enter the industry until January 1996. (See Nichols Decl., P 6.) Although Nichols was an 
Ohmeda employee prior to and during the limitations period and was aware of Ohmeda's parts policy when he formed Anatech, 
(see id., PP 5-6, 16-17), his late entry into the market means Anatech did not suffer antitrust injury until some point within the 
limitations period. Thus, even if the other plaintiffs' claims were time-barred, Anatech's claims would go forward. "
712,2," Defendant also relies on Pace Industries, 813 F.2d 234, but that case is limited to a particular kind of allegation. In Pace 
Industries, the only alleged antitrust violation was the defendants' prosecution of a lawsuit seeking to enforce an assertedly 
illegal contract. The plaintiff argued that ""each phase"" of the lawsuit ""from the filing of [the] complaint through resolution of the 
final appeal constituted discrete overt acts which restarted the statute of limitations."" Id. at 237. The Ninth Circuit rejected this 
argument, holding that the filing of the suit was the last overt act for statute of limitations purposes ""where the alleged antitrust 
violation is the attempted enforcement of an illegal contract through the judicial process."" Id. "
713,3," However, as counsel for plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument, plaintiffs' recovery is limited to damages suffered within the 
four-year limitations period. See Hanover Shoe Co. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 502, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 2236, 20 L. 
Ed. 2d 1231 (1968); LaSalvia v. United Dairymen of Ariz., 804 F.2d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 1986)."

714,," Although ""ultimately what constitutes a relevant market is a factual determination for the jury,"" Kodak II, 125 F.3d at 1203, a 
court may grant summary judgment on a ยง 2 claim where no reasonable jury could find in favor of the plaintiff on the relevant 
market issue, see Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1435."
714,5, Both parties assume for this motion that the relevant geographic market is the United States. (See Mot. at 33 n.100.)
714,6," Life cycle pricing is discussed later in greater detail as part of Ohmeda's attempt to distinguish Kodak I on the basis that its 
customers (1) were not surprised by any sudden changes to Ohmeda's parts sales policy, (2) make purchasing decisions in the 
equipment market based on costs throughout the life cycle of the equipment, and (3) were not locked in to continued use of 
Ohmeda machines by high switching costs. These factors are considered infra in Part III.A.3 as part of the evaluation of 
Ohmeda's market power, although they also relate to market definition. See Kodak I, 504 U.S. at 469 n.15, 112 S. Ct. at 2083 
n.15 (""Whether considered in the conceptual category of 'market definition' or 'market power,' the ultimate inquiry is the same -- 
whether competition in the equipment market will significantly restrain competition in the service and parts markets.""). "
715,7," These statistics include monitor service as part of the relevant market; excluding monitors would likely increase Ohmeda's 
market share."
715,8," Plaintiffs argue that Ohmeda's share of the service market on its machines is actually higher than the data suggest because the 
data include customers who service their machines in-house and thus, according to plaintiffs, do not participate in the service 
market at all. (See Opp'n at 44-46.) But because the proper definition of an antitrust market turns on ""whether consumers view 
the products as substitutes for each other,"" Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1435, in-house technicians may be viewed as part of the overall 
service market. In-house technicians are a substitute for outside service contracts, whether with Ohmeda or an ISO. "
716,9," In other words, A (Ohmeda's share of the Ohmeda service market) will equal B (Ohmeda's share of the total service market) 
divided by C (Ohmeda's share of the equipment market, or the percentage of all machines that were made by Ohmeda)."
716,10," Forty percent (Ohmeda's share of the service market on all machines, according to Ohmeda) divided by .55 (Ohmeda's share 
of the market for sales of anesthesia equipment) equals 72.73% (.40 / .55 = .7273). This figure is very close to the 71% share of 
the market for service on Ohmeda anesthesia machines that plaintiffs contend Ohmeda controls. "
717,11," Acknowledging that the Kodak I Court ""did not explicitly state the extent to which Kodak's change in policy affected the Court's 
analysis,"" the Sixth Circuit in Honeywell bases its interpretation of Kodak I on the following cryptic statement in a footnote: "
718,," the dissent disagrees [with our conclusion in this case] based on its hypothetical case of a tie between equipment and 
service. ""The only thing lacking"" to bring this case within the hypothetical case, states the dissent, ""is concrete evidence 
that the restrictive parts policy was generally known."" But the dissent's ""only thing lacking"" is the crucial thing lacking --
evidence."
718,504," U.S. at 477 n.24, 112 S. Ct. at 2087 n.24. This enigmatic comment, designed as a brisk rejoinder, is too slender a reed on 
which to base a significant restriction on the Court's holding particularly when in its very next sentence, the Kodak I majority 
emphasizes that liability ""depends on whether the equipment market prevents the exertion of market power in the [aftermarket]."" 
The Sixth Circuit also attempts to limit Kodak I in light of Jefferson Parish, on the theory that unless a change of policy is 
understood as a critical component of the Kodak I decision, then Kodak I would implicitly overrule Jefferson Parish. But the two 
cases are so factually distinct that there is little or no tension between them. In the factual setting of Jefferson Parish, where 
there was no evidence of an increase in price or decrease in quality of the tied product -- anesthesiology services -- and no 
evidence that any consumer was forced to accept unwanted anesthesiology services, the Court was unwilling to base a finding 
of an illegal tying arrangement solely on alleged market imperfections, including information costs. Jefferson Parish is not 
addressed to the question of information costs in the context of after market services and the effect of competition in the 
equipment market. Nor is much of the discussion in the Seventh Circuit's opinion in Digital consistent with Kodak I. The Digital court noted that 
Kodak I could not stand for the proposition that ""there is a market in a firm's own products, even if it sells in vigorous 
competition,"" 73 F.3d at 762, because then Kodak I would have effectively overruled the Supreme Court's earlier decision in 
Jefferson Parish. In the first place, Kodak I does hold, and unambiguously, that a single brand can be a relevant antitrust market 
where ""service and parts for [that brand] are not interchangeable with other manufacturers' service and parts."" See Kodak I, 504 
U.S. at 482, 112 S. Ct. at 2090. It is doubtful that this holding is inconsistent with Jefferson Parish, in which the Court found that 
a hospital -- the ""single brand"" -- did not have market power because consumers could easily travel to other hospitals. In any 
event, Digital does not involve the specific question of aftermarket servicing that was the issue in Kodak I and is the issue here."
718,12," Declining to reverse the jury's verdict for plaintiffs, the court stated that the record reflects the following [evidence of monopoly power in the service market]: Kodak has a 95% share of the Kodak 
high volume photocopier service market and an 88% share of the Kodak micrographic service market. Several ISOs 
withdrew from the Kodak service market or substantially restricted their service due to the lack of available parts, although 
other ISOs made substantial profits and continued to grow steadily. Some ISOs could not obtain any parts for newer 
models, indicating that the current ISO service market may last only as long as the pre-1986 models survive. Kodak 
equipment customers experienced the ""lock-in"" and information imperfections as described in [Kodak I]. Kodak's market 
share in the equipment market further limits choices by consumers. Finally, although Kodak criticizes their methodology, the "
719,," ISOs presented evidence that Kodak earns supracompetitive profits in service, and overall. Substantial evidence supports 
the jury's verdict on the issue of Kodak's service market monopoly. Kodak II, 125 F.3d at 1212."
719,13," Ohmeda replies by noting that this figure applies only to machines traded in at the end of their useful lives. (See Horner Decl., 
P 6.) Ohmeda asserts that a newer used machine would command significantly more on the trade-in market, but they provide no 
testimony or evidence to support this specific assertion. Ohmeda does offer general testimony about the ""lively"" market for used 
anesthesia systems. (See Brandmeier Decl., P 16; Willig Decl. at 89.) This is an issue for the fact finder to resolve. "
720,14," Kodak also refused to sell parts to ISOs, controlled sales of parts by OEMs, pressured its customers not to purchase service 
from ISOs, and restricted the availability of used Kodak machines. See Kodak I, 504 U.S. at 456-48, 112 S. Ct. at 2076-78. "
723,15," In their complaint, plaintiffs assert both a per se tying claim and a tying claim under the rule of reason. (See Compl., PP 100-
111.) As the Sixth Circuit noted in Honeywell, however, these theories have merged in recent years. See Honeywell, 104 F.3d at 
815 n.2. As applied by the Supreme Court in Kodak I, per se tying analysis involves detailed factual inquiries into the defendant's 
market power and whether the defendant's challenged conduct has procompetitive effects, see Kodak I, 504 U.S. at 478-79, 112 
S. Ct. at 2088-89, which looks more like traditional rule of reason methodology than a per se rule. The Supreme Court never 
mentions the terms ""per se"" or ""rule of reason"" in its Kodak I opinion. Professors Areeda, Elhauge and Hovenkamp explain the 
apparent merger of the two tying theories by stating that ""the per se rule against tying is 'per se' in only one respect -- namely, 
dispensing with proof of anticompetitive effectsโฆ ."" 10 Areeda, Elhauge & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1760e, at 372 (1996). 
The two theories may be analyzed together on this motion."
723,16," As was the case with the distinction between the equipment sales market and the service market, there is sufficient customer 
demand for market participants to provide service but not parts and vice versa. Like Kodak I, there is evidence in the record in 
this case ""that service and parts have been sold separately in the past and still are sold separately to self-service equipment 
owners."" Kodak I, 504 U.S. at 462, 112 S. Ct. at 2080. Many, if not most, ISOs do not sell parts and would presumably not need 
to if Ohmeda would make service restricted parts readily available to equipment owners. "
725,17," In fact, the inadmissible hearsay evidence plaintiffs have offered supports the opposite conclusion. Several plaintiffs testify that 
various OEMs have told them that although they would like to sell service restricted parts directly to ISOs, Ohmeda will not let 
them. (See Foster Decl., P 16; Garrett Decl., P 18; J. McBride Decl., P 5.) The alleged statements by OEMs are out-of-court 
statements offered for their truth -- i.e., to prove that Ohmeda coerced OEMs into a group boycott - and as such are hearsay, 
see Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), and are inadmissible to defeat a motion for summary judgment, see Anheuser-Busch v. Natural 
Beverage Distributors, 69 F.3d 337, 345 n.4 (9th Cir. 1995), unless they fall within an exception to the hearsay rule, see, e.g., 
Fed. R. Evid. 801(d), 803, 804. Plaintiffs do not suggest any potentially applicable hearsay exceptions and none is readily 
apparent. In any event, although plaintiffs offer the statements to prove the existence of a common scheme, they actually point to the 
opposite conclusion. The fact that OEMs would sell service restricted parts directly to ISOs but for Ohmeda's insistence on the 
tooling clause tends to prove that the tooling clause was Ohmeda's unilateral creation rather than the result of concerted action 
between Ohmeda and its OEMs. As noted below, it would make no economic sense for OEMs to agree to the tooling clause if 
they had any choice in the matter, because the tooling clause restricts their ability to sell their products and earn revenue."
725,18," In one case, the Ninth Circuit appeared to create another requirement for a defendant seeking summary judgment in a ยง 1 
case: proof that ""permitting an inference of conspiracy would pose a significant deterrent to beneficial procompetitive behavior."" 
In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litig., 906 F.2d 432, 440 (9th Cir. 1990). The Ninth Circuit 
has not always imposed the requirement in subsequent cases. See American Ad Management, 92 F.3d at 788-89. The significant deterrent requirement has its origins in the Supreme Court's opinion in Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith 
Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In Matsushita, the Court ""emphasized that courts should 
not permit factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible, because the effect of such practices is often to 
deter procompetitive conduct."" 475 U.S. at 593, 106 S. Ct. at 1360. ""Thus, mistaken inferences in cases such as this one are 
especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Id. at 594, 106 S. Ct. at 1360. 
Here, the inference plaintiffs ask the court to draw -- that OEMs agreed with Ohmeda to adopt a tooling clause that substantially 
limited the OEMs' sales opportunities -- is implausible on its face, and plaintiffs have offered no evidence to suggest otherwise. Moreover, plaintiffs do not dispute that tooling clauses are standard throughout the medical anesthesia equipment industry and 
have the effect of protecting Ohmeda's proprietary service restricted parts from counterfeiting. There is no question that 
Ohmeda's ability to protect its proprietary parts enhances its ability to compete in the equipment sales market. Inferring a 
conspiracy from the tooling clause would restrict Ohmeda's ability to protect its proprietary parts and thus hamper this beneficial "
726,," procompetitive behavior. Similarly, it would interfere with an OEM's ability to accede to unilaterally imposed conditions. This is a 
sufficient showing to satisfy the Petroleum Products standard. "

755,4," Plaintiffs claim that this court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, but ยง 1983 contains no jurisdictional 
provision. Congress provided for federal jurisdiction over federal civil rights claims in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343. See Ybarra v. Town of 
Los Altos Hills, 503 F.2d 250, 252 (9th Cir. 1974); York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450 (9th Cir. 1963). Strictly speaking, federal courts 
have subject matter jurisdiction over ยง 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, as long as the complaint alleges ""'a right to 
recover under the Constitution and laws of the United States,'"" and is not ""'wholly insubstantial and frivolous.'"" Keniston v.

762,1," In 1995, DEC extended the three-year warranty policy to new versions of the mid-range VAX systems. "
765,2," Although SMS lobbies for a different legal standard, the focal point of its consumer exploitation thesis is that DEC is attempting 
to exploit its installed base and achieve a monopoly (or a near-monopoly market share) in the services aftermarket by imposing 
a three-year warranty on all hardware purchases. In the last analysis, this theory depends on the proposition that DEC asserts 
power in the services aftermarket only by forcing matters in the primary computer equipment market, and thus raises questions 
characteristic of those situations in which monopolists are alleged to have parlayed power from one market into another. See, 
e.g., Kodak, 504 U.S. at 461-62 (discussing tying); United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107-08, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 
(1948) (discussing leveraging). This approach, in and of itself, invites us to look at the primary market, and thus tends to confirm 
our conclusion that, in determining whether DEC enjoys an aftermarket monopoly, we cannot ignore the impact of the 
foremarket. "
766,3," In addressing the question of information deficits between a foremarket and an aftermarket, perfect information about the 
aftermarket is not required. Rather, the focus should be on whether the primary market is in possession of information that 
sufficiently reveals the anticompetitive tendencies of a manufacturer in its aftermarket. The nature of this information will depend 
on the product, the plaintiff's theory, and the particular facts. In some cases (like Kodak), lifecycle costing may be significant. In 
others, however, primary market consumers will not need to calculate lifecycle costs to gain an appreciation for what is 
happening in an aftermarket. Here, SMS points to no aftermarket behavior on DEC's part that would necessitate a foremarket 
consumer's inquiry into lifecycle costs. And in all events, SMS's theory of the case makes lifecycle costing irrelevant. "
768,4," This schema will not be true for every copier owner. If, for example, the remaining useful life of the copier is short enough that 
scrapping the machine rather than submitting to supracompetitive aftermarket prices becomes a viable option, there is no lock-in 
with respect to that customer. Where relevant, the percentage of installed base customers who have old machines as opposed 
to those who have purchased more recently may be important to determining whether there is a substantial lock-in. We need not 
pursue the matter here. "
770,5," For example, there is no evidence that DEC has displayed a pattern of raising service and parts prices in the aftermarket, nor is 
there evidence that the price of the warranty itself represented a means of extracting monopoly profits. Indeed, SMS has taken 
the position that the price of the warranty -- whatever it may be -- actually represents a loss to DEC compared to what it would 
have gained had it kept its one-year warranties and charged for service during the second and third years."
770,6," In this regard, SMS points to evidence that DEC was not depending on its VAX models to grow market share. This evidence, 
however, is not damaging. Because Alpha and VAX both compete for the DEC installed base, one would expect that the terms 
governing the sale of VAX computers must be comparable to those of Alpha models. And if Alpha computers are competitive 
with computers in the mid-range computer market generally, then a transitive logic compels the conclusion that VAX terms are 
disciplined by the mid-range market. SMS has adduced no proof to suggest that matters are any different."
770,7," We do not mean to suggest that price discrimination is always a sign of anticompetitive behavior. It is not. See, e.g., Monahan's 
Marine, Inc. v. Boston Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525, 527-28 (1st Cir. 1989). "
772,8," SMS claims that the warranty also indirectly causes further damage to ISOs because of the phenomenon of ""one stop"" 
servicing. The idea is that companies that have several DEC machines will opt to go with DEC services after purchasing a new 
(warranty-bearing) computer because they do not want to deal with the confusion resulting from having several different service 
providers. As with much else in this case, concrete evidence that this supposed behavioral pattern exists, or that it is in any way 
significant, is wanting. "
780,1," THORN Americas, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of THORN EMI, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of TEMINAH, the 
ultimate North American parent company. TEMINAH, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of THORN EMI, plc, a British 
conglomerate that owns and operates businesses worldwide. The plaintiffs originally sued additional related companies such as 
THORN EMI (USA) Holdings, Inc., but these companies subsequently merged into THORN Americas or TEMINAH, thereby 
ceasing to have a separate corporate existence."

appellant TEMINAH. We also capitalize ""THORN,"" even when citing to other opinions, to reflect THORN's own practice. "
784,3," The sole exception is the Eleventh Circuit, which does not require distinctiveness between the person and enterprise. See Cox 
v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie, 17 F.3d 1386, 1398 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1110 (1995)."
784,4," The plaintiffs claim the Seventh Circuit has determined that allegations that subsidiaries conducted a parent-company 
enterprise are sufficient. The plaintiffs base their argument on Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Co., 747 F.2d 384 
(7th Cir. 1984), aff'd on other grounds, 473 U.S. 606, 87 L. Ed. 2d 437, 105 S. Ct. 3291 (1985), in which the Seventh Circuit 
asserted that it is ""virtually self-evident that a subsidiary acts on behalf of, and thus conducts the affairs of, its parent 
corporation."" 747 F.2d at 402-03. More recently, however, the Seventh Circuit has indicated that related business entities may 
not serve as both the person and enterprise. In Bachman v. Bear, Stearns & Co., 178 F.3d 930, 1999 WL 335343 (7th Cir. 
1999), the court appears to reject the conclusion it suggested in Haroco. Stating that it deliberately omitted four corporations 
when it described the alleged RICO enterprise, the Court explains, ""HN14[
] A firm and its employees, or a parent and its 
subsidiaries, are not an enterprise separate from the firm itself."" Id. at *2; see also Fitzgerald v. Chrysler Corp., 116 F.3d 225,

criminal conspiracy where corporate agents conspired with each other on behalf of the corporation). "

788,7," While Reynoldsville Casket states that sometimes retrospective remediation should be considered independently from 
retroactive application and provides instances of when such independent consideration was appropriate, the Supreme Court in 
Reynoldsville Casket does not provide a test a court should use when evaluating whether a retrospective remedy is appropriate. 
The Supreme Court, however, largely superseded Chevron Oil when, in Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 
96-97, 125 L. Ed. 2d 74, 113 S. Ct. 2510 (1993), it enunciated a new standard for assessing when a legal principle should be 
applied retroactively. Under this new standard, ""when [the Supreme] Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, 
that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct 
review and as to all events."" Id. at 97 If this Court applied the Harper standard to the present case, the Minnesota Supreme "

named defendants that defendant DESTEC will not sell electricity at wholesale for delivery at substations, including 
substations owned or to be acquired by plaintiff MID and specifically including the Linde substation in Pittsburg, California. Compl., at P 24. It further added in its opposition that PG&E's refusal to deal with either DESTEC or MID with respect to the 
Praxair substation also constitutes a section 1 violation: PG&E ""refused to enter into an interconnection agreement with . . . MID 
(and refused DESTEC's request pursuant to the CATSA) which would have permitted MID to resell electric power from the

814,2," The Examiner is an evening paper owned by the Hearst Corporation. The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle, a non-
Hearst morning paper, produce a joint Sunday edition; they share facilities and noneditorial business functions pursuant to a joint 
operating agreement authorized by the Newspaper Preservation Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1801-1804; 28 C.F.R. ยง 48.1-48.16 (1998)). 
The overlap between the two papers is the responsibility of the San Francisco Newspaper Printing Company, Inc. That entity 
and the Hearst Corporation were named as defendants and answered the complaint at issue here. For purposes of simplicity, 
however, these defendants will be collectively referred to as ""the Examiner."" The Independent is owned by Pan Asia Venture Capital Corporation, the plaintiff in this litigation. In order to maintain the 
symmetry of this dispute between newspapers, plaintiff will be referred to as ""the Independent."""
814,3," The Independent bid $ 2.35 per line, while the Examiner bid $ 2.28. The Examiner concedes, however, that technical factors 
such as differing type size and line count means that ""the dollar amounts of the respective bids . . . are not directly comparable. 
To derive directly comparable bids, the dollar amount of the Independent's bid must be reduced by approximately 15 . . . which 
reduces the Independent's bid of $ 2.35 per line to approximately $ 2.00 per line for purposes of comparison."" "
815,4," In its opening brief, the Examiner states: ""Although Defendants continue to believe that the Examiner can be viewed as 
constituting a single 'product' with multiple revenue streams--a newspaper containing both editorial material and paid 
advertisements--the distinction is academic in the circumstances of this case. Whether the Examiner is viewed as a single, 
integrated product, or as two distinct products--a newspaper and advertising, Defendants did not engage in below-cost pricing. 
Nor would Defendants be found to have engaged in below-cost pricing if one separately calculated the costs of classified 
advertisements. For that reason, Defendants' arguments in this brief are addressed to other rulings of the trial court, and 
assume--solely for purposes of this appeal, and arguendo--that there are indeed two 'products': a daily 'newspaper product' 
which consumers purchase from a newsstand or by subscription, and an 'advertising product.' Defendants reserve the right to 
contend in the future, should the occasion arise, that their 'product' or 'products' should be defined differently. [P] It should be 
noted, however, that Plaintiff's two-product theory--which is a fundamental premise of Plaintiff's claim in this case--is inconsistent 
with Plaintiff's rationale for the 'revenue allocation' methodology that the trial court approved."" The Independent treated this as a ""concession"" that the Examiner was not contesting the trial court's ruling that two products 
were at issue. The Examiner responded in its reply brief that no such concession had been made; it also made the first 
developed argument attacking the two-product ruling as a grounds for reversal. Three days after the Examiner's reply brief was 
filed, a number of publishers filed an amicus curiae brief supporting the Examiner, in which they passionately contend that the 
trial court's ruling on this issue was error. This mutual desire of the Examiner and amici curiae to now litigate the two-product 
ruling on appeal will not be indulged. As did the Independent, we too read the language in the Examiner's opening brief as a concession that it will not be contesting 
the correctness of the trial court's two-product ruling. The operative language of the footnote--""the distinction is academic in the 
circumstances of this case,"" ""Defendants' arguments in this brief are addressed to other rulings,"" ""assume--solely for purposes 
of this appeal . . . --that there are indeed two 'products,' "" ""Defendants reserve the right to contend in the future, should the 
occasion arise"" (italics added)--cannot be reasonably read as other than a concession. Nor does the reference to page 32 at the 
end of the footnote assist the Examiner. Page 32 finds the Examiner stating: ""If, as Plaintiff urged and the trial court ruled, the 
'newspaper product' and the 'advertising product' are indeed separate products for purposes of the UPA, then the cost of each 
such 'product' must be measured separately and accurately."" A FOOTNOTE AT THIS POINT GOES ON: ""Conversely, if Plaintiff 
persists in arguing that the pricing of advertising and newspapers are inseparably intertwined, it will be necessary for the Court 
to examine the trial court's ruling that they are, indeed, two separate 'products' for purposes of the UPA's below-cost pricing 
statute."" These 10 lines do not constitute a developed argument with supporting authority and appropriate references to the 
record. The opening brief will therefore not be regarded as raising the issue of the two-product ruling for review. (See, e.g., 
Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal. App. 3d 218, 228 [220 Cal. Rptr. 712].) There being no reason why 
the issue could not have been developed in the opening brief, the Examiner's attempt to raise it in the reply brief will not be 
indulged. (See, e.g., Scott v. CIBA Vision Corp. (1995) 38 Cal. App. 4th 307, 322 [44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 902]; Neighbours v. Buzz 
Oates Enterprises (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d 325, 335, fn. 8 [265 Cal. Rptr. 788].) The amicus curiae brief cannot remedy this 
defect because amici curiae are not allowed to expand the issues raised by the parties. (See, e.g., California Assn. for Safety 
Education v. Brown (1994) 30 Cal. App. 4th 1264, 1274-1275 [36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 404] and decisions cited.) Exceptions are allowed 
on points of jurisdiction or issues that will result in affirmance (see E. L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach (1978) 21 Cal. 3d 
497, 511 [146 Cal. Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505]), but amici curiae are attempting to argue a nonjurisdictional evidentiary error they 
view as requiring reversal. The ordinary rule of party issue selection and preclusion therefore applies to this and the other 
evidentiary error claimed only by amici curiae. "
816,, The Examiner will of course be able to ask the trial court to reconsider this ruling if there is a retrial. 
817,5," The jury was instructed that ""the evidence in this case has been that the only method for allocating costs to these two products 
[i.e., the newspaper product and advertising space product] is the so-called 'revenue method' of allocating joint costs. The 
revenue method of allocating joint costs is a method based on the assumption that the ratio between the amounts of revenue 
earned by the products involved is the same as the ratio of the costs incurred in producing these products."" (Italics added.) Two days into their deliberations the jury asked the court ""Is the revenue method the only legal method to consider in 
determining if the cost of advertising is below cost in this case?"" The court responded that ""The answer to that question is yes."" 
Counsel for the Independent had forcefully made the same point during his closing argument. The court drove the same point home by telling the jury what they could not consider: ""During the trial of this action, there has 
been evidence of methods of cost allocation defendants used before [the date of their winning bid] to determine their costs. I 
instruct you that you are to consider those methods only as they may bear on the defendants' state of mind, and not as methods 
which you may apply to determine the defendants' advertising costs in this action."" One other point must be mentioned. The Examiner states in its brief that ""[D]uring its deliberations the jury inquired as to which 
portions of Dr. Crichfield's testimony were in evidence . . . but the trial court never clarified the issue."" The clear implication of 
this passage is that the trial court was, to use the mildest term, derelict in its duty. The Examiner's statement is literally true but 
almost slanderous in its innuendo. What actually happened, and what clearly appears on page 7354 of the reporter's transcript, 
is that the jury foreman told the court ""The jury has decided we no longer need the information that we requested."" The court 
then verified ""you are telling me that you no longer need this information; is that right?"" The jury foreman answered, ""That's 
right."" "
818,6," HN12[
] Cost is to be measured as ""the fair average cost of production over a reasonable time, rather than the cost of one 
item on a particular occasion."" ( Johnson v. Farmer (1940) 41 Cal. App. 2d 874, 882 [107 P.2d 959].) This is not a problem in 
this case, where both sides' cost studies and models were based on annual production costs. "
820,7," Not even Dr. McLeod made this claim for his method. He candidly admitted that using revenue allocation was ""a judgment call 
to some extent,"" that it was not a ""precise formula,"" but it was ""the best you can come up with under the circumstances."" "
821,8, Dr. McLeod's bottom-line per-line cost figure fluctuated from $ 1.82 to $ 1.92.
821,9," As cogently expressed by amici curiae: ""A physical-unit method of accounting is appropriate because it directly tracks the 
requirement that it be 'reasonably related to the burden such product or service imposes on the overall cost of doing business.' 
[Citation.] Unlike the revenue-allocation method, the physical-unit method actually has a close relationship to the working 
operations of the newspaper. Public notice advertising takes up physical space in the newspaper, thereby consuming newsprint 
and ink, is sold in physical units known as column-inches, and is delivered to readers in such physical form."""
821,10," The difficulty with the revenue approach is perhaps best illustrated with a specific example: Dr. McLeod identified $ 
15,863,613 as ""editorial costs,"" yet his approach allocates almost all of these costs to the ""advertising product."" "
822,11," We reject the Independent's argument that this issue amounts to invited error and was waived by the Examiner's counsel 
when he asked the court to decide the reasonableness of the respective cost models as a matter of law. First, that request was 
made in connection with the first model submitted by Dr. Crichfield, which the court found was unallocated, resulting in its order 
that a new model be prepared. The Examiner's request was not renewed with respect to the second Crichfield model, the one at 
issue here. The second Evidence Code section 402 hearing was conducted at the Independent's request, based on its motion to 
exclude Dr. Crichfield's second cost determination study. Second, the trial court obviously did not deem the Examiner's request 
applicable to the second model, as evident from its initial decision that neither it nor the McLeod model was ""unreasonable"" and 
the choice between them would be left to the jury."
822,12," As the Independent's attorney told the jury in his opening statement: ""[W]hat this case is all about is the allegation on the part 
of The Independent that when The Independent competed with The Examiner . . . to get the public notice contract . . . The 
Examiner bid below cost, below their fully allocated cost."""
822,13," E.g., ""And so what they chose to do was to hire Dr. Crichfield. They will say that Dr. Crichfield is an independent accountant 
who gave them independent advice with regard to their costs. [P] But the evidence will show that, in fact, Dr. Crichfield's primary 
career role is the creation of litigation cost models, and that this cost model is really a cost model designed to defend The 
Examiner in a lawsuit. . . . There are some other accounting tricks . . . which Dr. McLeod [the Independent's expert] will say 
makes this allocation study by Dr. Crichfield completely useless."""
822,14," In its petition for rehearing, the Independent contends that we ""mistakenly decided the 'cost' issue under Evidence Code 
section 403 instead of Evidence Code section 405."" We were not mistaken, because we decided no such issue, and the 
Independent's belated presentation of this claim will not avert reversal. "
823,," The Independent's argument is apparently based on this statement from Turnbull: ""To be legally acceptable, the allocation of . . . 
costs to a particular product or service must be reasonably related to the burden such product or service imposes on the overall 
cost of doing business."" ( Turnbull & Turnbull v. ARA Transportation, Inc., supra, 219 Cal. App. 3d 811, 822.) The Independent 
reasons that whether Dr. Crichfield's model complied with this standard is a preliminary fact, one that Evidence Code section 
405 vests with the trial court to decide.  Evidence Code section 403, by contrast, allows the jury to decide whether the 
preliminary fact exists if ""the court finds that there is evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary 
fact"" ( Evid. Code, ยง 403, subd. (a)). In fact, the latter statute requires the issue of preliminary fact determination to be submitted 
to the jury but ""Section 405 requires the judge to determine the existence or nonexistence of disputed preliminary facts except in 
certain situations covered by Section[] 403 . . . . Section 405 deals with evidentiary rules designed to withhold evidence from the 
jury because it is too unreliable to be evaluated properly or because public policy requires its exclusion."" (See Assem. Com. on 
Judiciary, coms. to Evid. Code, ยง 403, 405, 29B West's Ann. Cal. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) pp. 361, 374; Deering's Ann. Cal. Evid. 
Code (1986) pp. 142, 150-151.) Whether the economic models' compatibility with section 17026 and the Turnbull standard is properly handled under Evidence 
Code section 403 or Evidence Code section 405 is an intriguing question, but one we cannot, and need not, decide. There is 
undoubtedly a case to be made for viewing the admissibility of evidence dependent upon its compliance with an established 
legal standard as one involving both reliability and public policy, and therefore governed by Evidence Code section 405. On the 
other hand, it is not fanciful to view the problem as relevance, that is to say, a model that did not comport with Turnbull would not 
be relevant on the issue of cost. This approach would make the problem subject to Evidence Code section 403, subdivision 
(a)(1). Certainly this was the trial court's initial view of the matter: In its written order deciding that the McLeod model could be 
used but Crichfield's initial model could not (see ante at pp. 428-429), the court made these decisions ""pursuant to Evidence 
Code section 403 (a)(1)."" Although the court did not enter a written order when it ruled that Crichfield's revised model was not 
""unreasonable in the context of . . . the Turnbull case"" and not ""unreasonable to the extent that it's something that should be 
precluded from being presented to the Jury altogether,"" it is difficult to believe the court would have shifted the statutory basis it 
had been employing up to that point. The blizzard of paper generated by the parties' motions to exclude the other's economic 
model demonstrates that neither party was entirely consistent in invoking either section 403 or 405 of the Evidence Code. 
Unfortunately, when the trial court reversed course it became impossible to determine if the court would have continued to treat 
the issue as an Evidence Code section 403 subject. It was because of this uncertainty that we said nothing more specific than 
that the court had conducted the pretrial hearings ""pursuant to Evidence Code section 402."" (See ante, at pp. 428-429.) It is 
therefore inaccurate for the Independent to believe we ""decided the 'cost' issue under Evidence Code section 403."" We did no 
such thing. The issue is also immaterial because there is little practical consequence to which statute the trial court used. With or without 
special instructions (see Evid. Code, ยง 403, subd. (c), 405, subd. (b)(2)), the essential duty of the jury would have been pretty 
much the same--judge the evidence against the Turnbull standard given in the court's instructions. With Turnbull as the 
benchmark, the jury would decide which party's evidence it found to reflect the Examiner's cost. If the jury had accepted 
Crichfield's model, it would in effect have decided that his evidence was compatible with the preliminary fact of compliance with 
the Turnbull standard and the McLeod model was not. On the other hand, if the jury had accepted the McLeod/Maher testimony, 
it would have reached the opposite conclusions. Such speculation aside, the Independent's contention is ultimately doomed because it does not matter which provision of the 
Evidence Code the trial court did or ought to have used. Even if (as the Independent assumes) the trial court did use Evidence 
Code section 405, the court erred when it determined that the Crichfield model was ""irrational"" and therefore presumably not 
fully allocated as required by section 17026 and Turnbull as a preliminary fact. Alternatively if the trial court did follow through on 
its initial ruling and continue to apply Evidence Code section 403 when it excluded Crichfield's evidence, the court would also be 
in error because ""there [was] evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary fact"" ( Evid. Code, ยง 403, 
subd. (a)), i.e., that it was fully allocated in compliance with governing legal criteria. Both of these possibilities are encompassed 
by our analysis and our conclusion that reversible error occurred."

842,1," In its briefs, Varni argued that it need show only a ""slight connection"" between Cargill and the conspiracy to survive summary 
judgment. See, e.g., United States v. Dunn, 564 F.2d 348, 357 (9th Cir. 1977). At oral argument, however, Varni expressly 
disclaimed any reliance upon this theory. "
843,2," This second requirement flows directly from Matsushita. As then-Judge Kennedy explained in Richards: Were the case to go to trial, [the antitrust plaintiff] would bear the burden of proving the existence of the alleged conspiracy 
. . . . To discharge its burden, it would have to introduce evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that a conspiracy . . . 
[is] more likely than not. If the evidence produced in opposition to a defendant's motion for summary judgment does not 
give reasonable support to a finding of conspiratorial, as opposed to unilateral, behavior, summary judgment is appropriate. Richards, 810 F.2d at 903 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986); 
6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law Par. 1405, at 21 (1986)). "
846,3," Varni also attempts to rely on a search warrant affidavit by FBI Agent Brian Shepard, which reports what a witness had told the 
FBI agent that a master had told the witness. The district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to consider this 
evidence because it was hearsay. See Quevedo v. Trans-Pacific Shipping, Inc., 143 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir. 1998)."
846,4," Importantly, we note that Varni's theory of the case is that Cargill conspired with the admitted conspirators to fix prices and to 
allocate market shares amongst themselves. Varni has not articulated a conspiracy theory wherein Cargill or the admitted 
conspirators actually conspired with Chinese producers to fix prices or to allocate market shares. "
848,5," This expansion was completed by 1994. Cargill also implemented improvements such as installing a liquid extraction recovery 
process, which increased the efficiency of the manufacturing process. "
849,6," For the same reason, we reject Varni's assertion that illegal conduct can be inferred from Cargill's failure to expand more 
rapidly in Europe."
849,7," In fact, the only market share data actually in the record - and thus the only data properly before this court - indicates that 
Cargill's market share continued to increase even after 1993. "
851,8," This document is not direct evidence of conspiracy because there remains a gap between the document and the conclusion 
that Cargill was a conspirator, a gap that can be bridged only by making some sort of inference. See Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 
120-21. "
852,9," Varni argues that the reports of its expert economist, Robert G. Harris, mandate the denial of Cargill's summary judgment 
motion. Harris concluded that a company acting independently would not have done many of the things that Cargill did. 
Purported to be irrational absent conspiratorial behavior on the part of Cargill were Cargill's decision to join ECAMA (the 
strongest piece of evidence in Harris's view), the virtual identity in list prices among citric acid producers, Cargill's failure to 
increase its market share between 1993 and 1995, its failure to expand its annual production capacity by more than it did, its 
decision not to enter the European citric acid market sooner, and the fact that, ""given the number and type of known contacts - to 
say nothing of other possible communications - between Cargill and personnel of the admitted conspirators, it is inconceivable "
853,," that Cargill remained ignorant of the existence of the conspiracy."" We have already considered all the evidence discussed by 
Harris, see supra Part III.A-III.L, and our conclusion that no piece of evidence tends to exclude the possibility that Cargill acted 
independently is not affected by the conclusory statements in the expert report to the contrary. See Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 
242."

869,5," The Court, therefore, does not reach FIDER's third argument that Savannah College has not alleged concerted action by the

880,1," We believe that the characterization of appellees' alleged conduct as a per se violation of ยง 1 is appropriate. Most boycotts

Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). If appellees committed the acts alleged, the state's cost for administering the Plan would have

881,4, Kodak presented no statistical evidence in support of its economic theory. 
884,5," The district court relied in part on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Medco assigned error to the district court's reliance on this

join together to lobby the government. The First Amendment shields this joint lobbying from antitrust liability, even when the 
competitors are seeking governmental action that would eliminate competition or exclude competitors. We do not believe it is 
necessary to invoke the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to affirm the district court's decision. "

necessarily a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. See Associated General, 459 U.S. at 535 n.31. "
914,4," At the outset, we reject American's argument that this court implicitly found American to have antitrust standing in American Ad 
I because we reversed the district court's award of summary judgment instead of affirming on other grounds. American Ad I, 
although relevant to the antitrust standing inquiry, raised neither the question of antitrust standing nor any of the Associated 
General standing factors. Furthermore, because the issue of antitrust standing can be raised at any time, see Amarel, 102 F.3d 
at 1507, GTE has not waived this defense by failing to have raised it prior to this point. Therefore, neither American Ad I nor this 
case's procedural posture compels a reversal. Because we conclude that American has antitrust standing under the test set forth in Associated General, we do not address 
American's alternative arguments. "

believe that case is properly analyzed, however, under Brunswick. The plaintiff's injury flowed from defendants' decision not to 
utilize its services. That decision, however, was independent of the defendants' unlawful conduct, agreeing to split the market. 
The plaintiff suffered no antitrust injury because its injury was not necessary to the unlawfulness of the defendants' conduct. "

the basis of a fixed percentage of the amount the advertisers saved by placing their ads through the plaintiffs instead of directly

to a suggestion that there is a danger of duplicative recoveries when the calculation of damages is complicated. The complexity 
of the calculation of damages is more appropriately considered under the third and fifth factors of the Associated General 
analysis. "

937,2," Although not explicitly alleged in the Complaint, it can be inferred from the various features discussed therein that digital editing

addition of various special effects."
937,3," Digital Images describes itself in its complaint as an exclusive Lightworks ""vendor."" Although the entertainment industry may 
use this term to describe rental companies like Digital Images which rent only Lightworks equipment, the term ""vendor"" has 
apparently lead to some unnecessary confusion. The Court will refer to Digital Images in this capacity as a ""lessor"" of Lightworks 
equipment."
937,4," The Complaint does not specify why potential customers refused to use a discontinued product, but the Complaint implies that 
such customers recognized that they would have to use Avid products in the future and should therefore begin their training on 
Avid products. The Court also assumes that customers refused to use Lightworks because work done with a discontinued 
computer product is often difficult to use in the future; once a product line has been discontinued, it is often difficult to find 
equipment capable of working with files formatted for that discontinued product line. "
939,5," In response to this characterization, Avid cited United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 
76 S. Ct. 994 (1956), for the proposition that ""markets generally are defined at the consumer level according to product 
substitutability."" This is a correct statement of the law. However, the relevant products are viewed not only in terms of the physical item used but also in the way in which consumers 
purchase the product in question. Using the automotive example discussed infra, it is obvious that the car renting market is "
940,," separate from the car buying market; there is very little cross-elasticity between the two markets because people do not 
generally choose between renting and buying cars. By contrast, it is less clear that the leasing market for automobiles is 
separate from the purchase market, because people may choose between leasing and buying a car. Although it is possible that there is some cross-elasticity between renting and purchasing video editing equipment, the Court 
would assume that there is a reasonably clear point at which an entity does enough video editing to make it worth purchasing 
the equipment. The Court would further assume that the vast majority of video editors are well to one side or another of that 
point. More importantly, despite an explicit invitation at Note 8 of the Court's May 25, 1999 Order, no party has chosen to disagree with 
the Court's characterization of two separate markets. Plaintiff, in fact, indicated that it ""believes that the Court's analysis of this 
case in terms of two markets (purchase and rental markets) is correct."" The Court does not now rule out the possibility that, on amendment, Plaintiff may allege that there is only a single market for 
""use of video editing equipment."" However, the Court would caution Plaintiff both that such an allegation must be made in good 
faith and that such an allegation runs the risk of placing Plaintiff in the position of being a distributor."
940,6," The Court draws this market definition from the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, which plainly allege a ""U.S. Market 
for Non-Linear Film Editing Systems."" See generally First Amended Complaint PP 7-10. It is not inconceivable that Plaintiff could have alleged a market limited to Lightworks products alone. However, the Court notes 
that such a limited market would seem to fly in the face of the Ninth Circuit's decision in General Business Systems v. North 
American Philips Corp., 699 F.2d 965 (9th Cir. 1983). In that case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that a market should 
be limited to one line of computers because purchasers were ""locked into"" that line of computers.  Id. at 972. Instead, the Ninth 
Circuit held that the relevant market was all similar small business computer systems. This is not to say that markets can never be limited to a particular product line, if there is no reasonable cross-elasticity between 
the particular market and markets for other brands. For example, replacement parts for Ford cars may be an entirely different 
market than replacement parts for Chrysler cars. See generally Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs. Inc., 504 U.S. 
451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992) (replacement parts Kodak copiers may be cognizable market). However, this 
complaint focuses upon production of new systems, and courts have usually rejected the claim that one brand is its own market 
when there are competing brands. Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. v. Smith, 34 F. Supp. 2d 459, 477 n.30 (E.D. Mi. 1998); cf.  
State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 118 S. Ct. 275, 282, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (""The primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to 
protect interbrand competition.""). "
941,7," The Court's May 25, 1999 Order contained an example that illustrated this point. Imagine that Ford and General Motors agreed 
not to sell their cars to any rental car agency, so that such rental car agencies would have to purchase cars at inflated prices 
from DaimlerChrysler. Although such rental car agencies are not the actual drivers of the cars, they are clearly the victims of the 
conspiracy as the parties who pay the higher prices. Moreover, although the artificial increase may be passed through in whole 
or in part to the ultimate car renters, it is obviously the rental agency and not the renter who has suffered the antitrust injury and 
who has antitrust standing. The parallel is clear. If Digital Images pays an artificially increased price for new video editing equipment, Digital Images has 
suffered antitrust harm and has antitrust standing."
941,8," The Court notes that the parties have provided some briefing on the question of whether private plaintiffs may sue for an 
artificial constraint on innovation. Nevertheless, the Court need not and does not reach the issue now. The Court only notes that 
no court yet has addressed this question, and that the question requires balancing complex policy considerations."
941,9," Defendants argue that unlike a price increase, a lack of innovation is not ""passed along"" from lessor to renter but is felt only by 
the renter. Plaintiff responds that the lessor is the only party properly situated to bring suit on behalf of the end users. As with the question above, the issue requires balancing complex policy issues which the Court need not now address."
941,10," In fact, the allegations in the current complaint would suggest that the destruction of demand for Plaintiff's current business 
has robbed it of any intention to make future purchases."
941,11," Plaintiff must not only allege that it has made or will make a new purchase, but Plaintiff must also allege that the new purchase 
involved an artificially increased price or an artificially less-innovative machine. Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to 
plead harm from purchasing a less-innovative machine, Plaintiff must allege that the machine is a less innovative digital editing 
system generally rather than a less innovative Lightworks machine. "
942,12," The Court recognizes that there are countervailing benefits in standardization of technical elements. Such standardization will 
create a larger market for related products, which in turn will increase economies of scale and allow more competition within the 
larger market. See generally, Mark A Lemley & David McGowan, Legal Implications of Network Economic Effects, 86 Calif. L. 
Rev. 479, 518 (1998) (discussing benefits of standard-setting organizations). Returning to the automobile context for an 
example, there is a clear benefit to the fact that most automobiles use certain standard sizes of tires. If tires were not 
standardized, tire manufacturers would have to make a different size tire for each make and model of car and the market for 
each tire would be much smaller. Had Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants agreed to standardize on the Avid system but continue to compete in creative Avid 
systems, the Court's conclusion on this element might well be different. Put another way, the Court does not mean that 
competing standards are always beneficial to the consumer so long as there are sufficient competitors within a given standard. 
However, in the absence of competition within a standard, competition between standards is presumptively better than no 
competition at all. "
943,13," Defendants also contend that Plaintiff's injury is an injury to an intermediary rather than a consumer, and that the antitrust laws 
were not designed to protect intermediaries. However, the Court rejects the concept that a harm to an intermediary is never 
actionable and indeed, American Ad II and Yellow Pages Cost Consultants, Inc. v. GTE Directories Corp., 951 F.2d 1158 (9th 
Cir. 1991), would both stand for the proposition that harm to an intermediary may be actionable under the right circumstances. It 
is true that distributors rarely have antitrust standing, but this relates more to the fact that the antitrust laws do not exist to prefer 
one distributor over another. "
944,14," The Court expects that owners of Peugot automobiles suffered such an immediate drop in the value of their Peugot 
automobiles when Peugot announced that it would cease selling cars in this country. "
945,15," Plaintiff's argument that the antitrust laws do protect against stigmatization is misplaced. It is true that the antitrust laws will 
prevent stigmatization where such stigmatization is a tool to limit competition. See, e.g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian 
Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497, 108 S. Ct. 1931 (1988). The antitrust harm in those cases, however, is not the 
stigmatization per se but the use of stigmatization to limit competition and target competitors. See generally National Ass'n of 
Review Appraisers and Mortg. Underwriters, Inc. v. Appraisal Foundation, 64 F.3d 1130 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that 
stigmatization not actionable where it does not restrain trade); Schachar v. American Academy of Ophthalmology. Inc., 870 F.2d 
397 (7th Cir. 1989) (same). In this case, Plaintiff's injury does not result from stigmatization intended to reduce competition, but merely as a by-product of 
Defendants' activity in a different market."
945,16," Reference to the last Areeda and Hovenkamp example may help clarify this point. Assume that a steel company supplies raw 
steel to a forklift manufacturer. Assume further that the forklift manufacturer merges with its only rival, and the resulting firm 
raises prices and cuts output. The steel company sells less steel to the combined forklift company. The steel company's injury as a supplier is not antitrust injury merely because the company also happens to be a forklift 
customer who buys forklifts. The steel company may, of course, bring suit for higher forklift prices -- which is the market in which 
the steel company is the customer. "
946,17," It is not sufficient that the plaintiff's harm be closely tied to the market in which trade was restrained, if plaintiff is not a 
participant in that market. See Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 812 F.2d 538, 540-41 (9th Cir. 1987) (rejecting claims of crew 
members who received commission on fish catch because crew members were not participants in the sale of the fish, which was 
the market in which canneries were allegedly restricting trade.)"
946,18," Although Ostrofe is more helpful to Plaintiff, it still does not expand the ""narrow exception"" sufficiently to bring Plaintiff within 
the exception. Ostrofe was an employee who was terminated for refusing to participate in a bid rigging-scheme. Ostrofe does 
say that the employee could sue because ""the injury he sustained was such an integral part of the scheme to eliminate 
competition."" 740 F.2d at 746. However, the Ninth Circuit made it clear that by ""integral part,"" the Ninth Circuit meant that the 
plaintiff's injury was necessary to achieve the conspirators' illegal end.  Id. at 746 (""The discharge of Ostrofe furthered the anti-
competitive scheme."") There is no allegation in this case that the harm to Digital Images was necessary to achieve the Defendants' goal. "
952,1," WPX also contends that these contracts unreasonably restrain trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 
Because we conclude that the contracts are not exclusive dealings contracts as WPX argues, the Section 1 claim fails as well."
952,2," WPX contended at oral argument that RPS does not provide next-day service in the western United States. WPX's own 
evidence belies this assertion. WPX presented evidence in the form of declarations that demonstrate that RPS does indeed 
provide next-day delivery service in the western United States and continues to develop routes and expand its next-day 
presence in the market in that region. "
958,1," The relevant statutes provide: ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce in this state is 
unlawful""; ""It is unlawful for any person to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in this state."" ยงยง 542.18, 542.19, Fla. Stat. (1997)."
958,2, See 15 U.S.C.A. ยงยง 1011-1015 (1997). 
978,1," The factual allegations are much more detailed than this Court's abrupt summary suggests. The plaintiff describes a conspiracy 
dating at least as far back as the early 1950's during which the tobacco companies and their agents discovered, then withheld 
from the public, critical information about the dangers of tobacco use. The plaintiff also describes in detail the great lengths to 
which the defendants allegedly lied to and otherwise deceived the public, scientists, and government regulators. However, the 
Court sees no need in repeating most of that in this Order. The point of this Court's granting of the dismissal motions, as is the 
case with the granting of any dismissal motion, is that even if all the allegations are true, the plaintiff has nevertheless failed to 
state a claim. "
981,2," The Second Circuit had previously issued this opinion at 172 F.3d 223 but requested it be withdrawn from the published 
volumes. Presumably, it will be published in the version distributed via Westlaw which the Circuit accessed after the parties had 
completed their briefing in the instant case. "
983,3," This uncertainty as to both causation and damages was precisely the sort of policy consideration discussed by the Second 
Circuit in Laborers Local 17, albeit in the context of evaluating standing to bring a RICO claim: These concerns become particularly pointed in a case, like the present one, where the injuries are alleged to derive not 
simply from defendants' affirmative misconduct but also from plaintiffs' fraudulently induced inaction. That is, it is often 
easier to ascertain the damages that flow from actual, affirmative conduct, than to speculate what damages arose from a 
party's failure to act. In the latter situation, as in the case at hand, it becomes difficult to distinguish among the multitude of 
factors that might have affected the damages. Here, for example, plaintiffs' alleged damages might have derived from 
inefficiencies in the Funds own management, as well as from non-smoking related health problems suffered by the 
smokers, and it would be the sheerest sort of speculation to determine how these damages might have been lessened had 
the Funds adopted the measures defendants allegedly induced them not to adopt. The complexity of these calculations makes the ultimate question of damages suffered by the Funds virtually impossible to 
determine. Indeed, this case seems to present precisely the type of large, complicated damages claims that Holmes and 
Associated General Contractors sought to avoid. Laborers Local 17, 1999 WL 639865 at *10 (2nd Cir. 1999)."
983,4," This was numbered as ""Count VI"" in plaintiff's complaint on page 103. "
995,1," For the sake of simplicity, the moving defendants -- Grinnell and Munson -- will be referred to herein as the ""defendants,"" 
although there is a third, and non-moving defendant, viz., Sutorius. "
996,2," The Robinson-Patman Act amended the Clayton Act. As a result, ยง 2(c) is sometimes referred to as ยง 2(c) of the Clayton Act, 
and sometimes as ยง 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act. Here, it will be referred to as ยง 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act. "
997,3, The text of ยง 4 of the Clayton Act is provided infra at 16. 
998,4," The issue, of course, is not whether an aggrieved party may recover damages as a result of a defendant's conduct, but instead 
whether such a recovery may be premised on the purported federal antitrust character of that conduct. Cf.  Calderone Enters. 
Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292, 1297 (2d Cir. 1971) (""Our decision [dismissing plaintiff's claim for 
treble damages under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act] does not leave the plaintiff here without a remedy. Assuming plaintiff's claims to be 
meritorious, it is not precluded from recovering single damages from UATC in a state court suit for breach of terms of the lease . 
. . .""). "
999,5," Plaintiff does not argue that ยง 4 is wholly irrelevant to its first cause of action. Indeed, it would be hard pressed to do so, since 
the sole statutory authority for the treble damages sought is found in that Section. But it vigorously contests defendants' claim 
that ยง 4 requires plaintiff to establish ""antitrust injury,"" which, again, it incorrectly construes as requiring proof of ""competitive 
injury."" "
1001,6," Section 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act provides that ""it shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one 
purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting 
to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, 
sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal 
terms."" "
1003,7," While commercial bribery under ยง 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act is, by its very nature and purpose, anticompetitive, the 
same may not be said of all per se antitrust violations. See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petro., 495 U.S. 328, 342, 109 L. Ed. 2d 
333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990) (""Actions per se unlawful under the antitrust laws [such as low prices produced by non predatory 
price fixing in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act] may nonetheless have some procompetitive effects."")"
1003,8," Parenthetically, although the district court in Hansel ' N Gretel Brand Inc. v. Savitsky, 1997 WL 543088, adopted the position 
that antitrust injury required proof of anticompetitive harm to permit damages under ยง 4 for a violation of ยง 2(c), it found that 
plaintiff's complaint satisfied that standard. Id. at *10. "
1005,9," In Benedict v. Amaducci, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17684, 92 Civ. 5239, 1995 WL 702444, at *8 (S.D.N.Y., Nov. 28, 1995), cited 
by plaintiff, the court held that because the complaint failed to allege that benefits were conferred without the consent of the 
employer, the complaint did not properly allege commercial bribery under Penal Law ยง 180.03 as a RICO predicate act. The 
court did not address whether a private right of action under Penal Law ยง 180.03 existed."
1005,10," Also, as the bribery in Liberman involved a public official, the Court explained that a more stringent rule should be applied. See 
232 A.D.2d at 49. Specifically, ""vendors that corrupt public officials forfeit their right to all payments due under the tainted 
transaction."" Id. The Liberman Court noted that, while the plaintiff did not seek such relief there, ""the policy . . . that those who "
1006,," engage in corrupt acts with public officials are subject to serious civil consequences, provides an independent basis for the 
awarding, at an absolute minimum, of damages equal to the amount of the bribe."" See id."
1006,11," Defendants do not take issue with plaintiff's argument that it should recover the amount of the bribes; in fact, defendants have 
offered a tender of judgment in that amount, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. (See Defs.' Reply Mem. at 24.) "
1011,1," Neal Clulee, Mary Clulee, Homeplace Batture Leasing, Inc. and N/C Materials, Inc. are referred to herein, in globo, as the 
""Clulee defendants."" "
1012,2," The court finds that none of the one-minute phone calls in this case involved any conversation, but show only that a call was 
made where an answering machine picked up. "
1013,3," The quoted language is from a summary of the conversation made by Courreges on an RAC ""Standard Conversation Form."""
1013,4, A child had been killed at Bayou Fleet's property while tunneling into sand piles.
1013,5," Such as: limiting operations to daylight hours, requiring level truck loads and covered truck beds, limiting the height of the 
stockpiles to the height of the levee, wetting ramps three times a day, fencing the stockpile, installing asphalt ramps over the "
1014,," levee, lowering the speed limit to 25 mph, installation of truck crossing signs, requiring sand hauling trucks to access the pits by 
traveling behind the levee."
1014,6, This operations permit was the same kind held by Vulcan which RAC chose not to operate under. 
1015,7," The affidavit was the second page of the fax transmission. Alexander was not able to produce the first page of the fax in 
discovery. Typically, the first page of a telefax is a cover sheet with only the name of the sender, the sender's fax number, and 
the number of pages telefaxed. For this reason and because the affidavit was never used, the court rejects Bayou Fleet's 
argument that the absence of the first page should create an adverse inference against the Clulee defendants. "
1016,8, Alexander abstained from voting. 
1017,9," The court may consider the Noerr-Pennington doctrine with respect to the liability of the Clulee defendants even though they 
did not assert the doctrine in their answer. The court raised the issue sua sponte a few weeks prior to trial and ordered the 
parties to brief the issue. The Clulee defendants then included the issue in the pre-trial order, over Bayou Fleet's objection. It has 
been held that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is not an affirmative defense in the sense that it is the plaintiff's burden to prove 
the substantive violation claimed, which cannot be done where the defendant's allegedly wrongful conduct consists of petitioning 
the government. See PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., 21 F. Supp. 2d 350, 355 (S.D.N.Y. 
1998)(citing 1 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ยง 207c (rev. ed. 1997)); see also McGuire Oil Co. v. 
Mapco, Inc., 958 F.2d 1552, 1558 n. 9 (11th Cir. 1992)(citing Areeda and H. Hovenkamp). Certainly, there would be no 
justification for the court to reject application of the doctrine on a procedural error, where to do so would abridge the defendant's 
First Amendment rights. Here, where Bayou Fleet was given adequate advance notice of the court's intent to consider the issue, 
and where the doctrine was asserted in the pre-trial order, it is appropriate to consider the Noerr-Pennington doctrine as it may 
apply in this case. "
1018,10," Bayou Fleet alleged but did not prove that the Clulee defendants abused the legislative process by bribing Alexander. There 
was some testimony that council members heard rumors that Clulee had bribed Alexander, but none of the witnesses were able 
to recall any specific details such as from whom they had heard the rumor. Because of the unreliability and prejudicial nature of 
this hearsay evidence, the court denied Bayou Fleet's motion to introduce this evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 807. 
The court did allow the evidence as a proffer. Even if the court were to have admitted the evidence, the court finds that it would 
not carry any probative value because of its vagueness and unreliability. Furthermore, to the extent that Bayou Fleet contends 
that a corrupt or illegal conspiracy existed, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not recognize a conspiracy exception. See City 
of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. at 382-83, 111 S. Ct. at 1355-56. "
1020,11," In the prior opinion rendered by this court, the court noted that there was no evidence presented at the hearing on the 
permanent injunction that Bayou Fleet's or any other sand pit's operations caused problems in the community. See Bayou Fleet, 
1997 WL 625492 *8. Such evidence was presented at the trial on the merits of plaintiff's claims."
1020,12," In the prior opinion rendered by this court, it was stated: ""Robin Durant's uncontradicted testimony establishes that the 
resolution was part of a scheme to eliminate Bayou Fleet's business so that Home Place would be the only sand pit in town."" 
See id. Neither the Clulees nor Alexander testified at that prior hearing. Furthermore, the court's conclusion herein, that there is 
no evidence of a conspiracy or joint action between the Clulee defendants and Alexander to put Bayou Fleet out of business by 
a unconstitutional means is not inconsistent with the court's prior statement. "
1027,1," Article V, Section 1 of the PLA reads ""the Contractor recognizes the Unions as the sole and exclusive bargaining 
representatives of all craft employees working on the Project within the scope of this Agreement."
1027,2," Article V, Section 3 (a) of the PLA reads, in pertinent part ""the Contractor will hire, per craft, one (1) journeyperson employee 
referred by the affected trade or craft, and may then hire (1) core employee who is employed by that Contractor and shall repeat 
the process, one and one, until the crew requirements for that craft are met. . . ."""
1027,3," Plaintiff filed a Reply Memorandum of Law and accompanying affidavit on September 27, 1999. Under the Local Rules, Reply 
papers in Order to Show Cause actions may only be filed upon leave of the Court. N.D.N.Y.L.R. 7.1(b)(2), 7.1(E). Leave was not 
granted so the Reply papers were not considered. "
1029,4," Section 8(f) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. ยง 158(f) ""authorizes construction industry employers and unions to enter into so-called 
'prehire' agreements setting the terms and conditions of employment for workers hired by the signatory employer without the 
union's majority status first having been established under ยง 9 of the Act."" McNeff, Inc. v. Todd, 461 U.S. 260, 75 L. Ed. 2d 830, 
103 S. Ct. 1753 (1983). The conditions under which labor agreements may be considered valid prehire agreements under 
Section 8(f) are: (1) the employer must be engaged primarily in the building or construction industry; (2) the labor organization 
must have members who are building and construction employees; and (3) and the agreement must cover employees engaged 
(or who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry. The parties in this case did not 
address the specific question of whether the PLA is a valid Section 8(f) agreement; however, the PLA, on its face, meets Section 
8(f)'s requirements. Congress indicated similar concerns in enacting Section 8(f) as it did in enacting Section 8(e). Thus, 
Congress recognized that ""construction industry unions often would not be able to establish majority support with respect to 
many bargaining units"" prior to employment and Congress was ""cognizant of the construction industry employer's need to 'know 
his labor costs before making the estimate upon which his bid will be based' and that 'the employer must be able to have 
available a supply of skilled craftsmen for quick referral.'"" Id., at 266 (internal citations omitted). The PLA in this case was 
negotiated to further substantially similar goals. See PLA Art. II. Agreements that fall within the ambit of Section 8(f) are 
collective bargaining agreements within the meaning of Connell, and thus, are protected by the Construction Industry Proviso. 
See Donald Shriver, 635 F.2d at 872-76. "
1030,5," Note that exceptions to this rule exist. Prehire agreements must be consistent with the goals of the NLRA. For example, a 
Union cannot enter into a prehire agreement for the purpose of restricting the subcontractors to which it may subcontract work 
rather than for the purpose of representing a subcontractors employees. See, e.g., Ironworkers District Council of Pacific 
Northwest, 292 N.L.R.B. 562, enf'd, 913 F.2d 1470 (9th Cir. 1990). "
1031,6," Article III Section 4 (a) of the PLA reads, in pertinent part, ""the District, the Construction Manager, and/or Contractors, as 
appropriate, have the absolute right to select any qualified contractor for the award of contracts or subcontracts on this Project. . 
. ."""
1031,7," New York Courts have found that School Districts and School Boards are entities of the State. See, e.g., City of New York v. 
State of New York, 86 N.Y.2d 286, 289, 631 N.Y.S.2d 553, 655 N.E.2d 649 (1995) (Municipal corporate bodies--counties, towns 
and school districts--are merely subdivisions of the State, created by the State for the convenient carrying out of the State's 
governmental powers and responsibilities as its agents.""); Herman v. Board of Education of Union School Dist. No. 8, Town of 
Arcadia, Wayne County, 234 N.Y. 196, 202, 137 N.E. 24 (1922) (""The school district is a civil division of the state. It may act only 
through its officers and agents. Its power of individual corporate action is limited to the choice of agents, who act in a 
representative capacity. Its members are the residents of the district. The board of education is the agency to which the state 
delegates the power and duty of controlling the schools in the district. Under such circumstances the position of the board is the 
same as that of any other agent of the state similarly situated.""). "
1032,8," Courts recognize two labor law exemptions to antitrust scrutiny- one statutory and one nonstatutory. See Local 210, 844 F.2d 
at 79. The statutory exemption is inapplicable here because it does not reach activity between a union and non-labor party, such 
as an employer. See Local 210, 844 F.2d at 79. Therefore, this discussion is relevant only to the non-statutory exemption. HN12[

1036,1," A member may enter a conflicting tournament if it is cosponsored or approved by the PGA, a major tournament such as the 
Masters or U.S. Open, the Ryder Cup tournament, a Nike Tour event (if the member meets certain qualifications), or, if the 
member is a foreign national, a golf event on his home circuit. (Pl.'s App. 1 at 25.) "
1037,2," If a Board member has a conflict of interest, a majority of the Board may vote to amend the Rules and Regulations ""even if (i) 
such majority is comprised of no Player Directors, and/or (ii) the disinterested directors constitute less than a majority of the 
Board, and provided further that if any Player Directors do not vote on such change, such majority shall include at least 75 
percent of the Player Directors voting thereon."" (Pl.'s App. 1 at 48.)"
1037,3," Defendant Royal Carribean Cruises, Ltd. served as both a local and title sponsor. (Def.'s App. 19.) Moreover, in addition to 
serving as a title sponsor for an individual tournament (the ""Cadillac-NFL Golf Classic""), General Motors paid for ""umbrella 
sponsorship"" rights to a series of telecasts of Tour events on ESPN. (Fitton Decl. Exs. B, C; Finchem Depo. at 94:11-23; 
Moorhouse Depo. at 71:22-25, 73:21-74:13). As an umbrella sponsor, GM was entitled to have its name presented as the overall 
series sponsor, a status distinct from the title sponsor of the individual tournaments comprising the series. (Fitton Decl. Ex.C at 
GM00000011.) "
1038,4," Defendants also maintain that summary judgment should be granted for title sponsors Franklin Covey Co. and Pacificare 
because Toscano was permitted to play in the tournaments sponsored by those defendants and therefore was not injured by 
them. To the extent, however, that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether Franklin Covey and Pacificare conspired with the 
Tour and the other sponsor defendants to maintain the rules challenged by Toscano, his claim continues as to these two 
defendants notwithstanding his participation in their tournaments. It is uncontroverted that the Rules and Regulations disqualified 
Toscano from participating in many other tournaments sponsored by the Tour. "
1039,5," As Toscano explains in his brief: Every fact of the combination complained of has financial gain written all over it. The Tour wants to continue to build its 
empire of golf-related businesses. The Tour's members (including the Player Directors) want to keep earning money 
playing golf, making appearances, giving endorsements, and even designing golf courses. The local sponsors need to be 
able to sell sponsorship packages to the title sponsors in order to continue operating. . . The title sponsors want to further 
relationships with their major clients, promote employee loyalty, and sell their products and services without having to 
compete with like-image products to reach their target markets. (Pls.' Am. Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. S. J. at 40.) "
1040,6," Where the challenged conduct raises strong antitrust suspicions and is therefore per se illegal, a contract may satisfy the 
concerted action requirement even if one of the parties was coerced into the agreement. For example, a sales contract alone 
may give rise to an inference of concerted action under ยง 1 if the agreement was part of a tying arrangement. See Datagate, Inc. 
v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 60 F.3d 1421, 1427 (9th Cir. 1995) (explaining that ยง 1's concerted action requirement ""is satisfied in tie-
in cases by the coerced sales contract for the tied item"") (emphasis omitted); Systemcare, Inc. v. Wang Labs. Corp., 117 F.3d 
1137, 1142 (10th Cir. 1997) (holding that ""a contract between a buyer and seller satisfies the concerted action element of section 
1 of the Sherman Act where the seller coerces a buyer's acquiescence in a tying agreement imposed by the seller""). In cases 
involving restraints that are per se illegal, it ""makes sense to err on the side of over-inclusiveness in determining the presence of 
an agreement,"" VII Areeda, supra, P 1437 at 5, because the restraints ""pose an unacceptable risk of stifling competition"", 
Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 9, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1556, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984); cf. Nynex, 119 S. Ct. at 
497 (observing that ""certain kinds of agreements will so often prove so harmful to competition and so rarely prove justified that 
the antitrust laws do not require proof that an agreement of that kind is, in fact, anticompetitive in the particular circumstance""). 
As explained above, however, this case does not involve allegations of tying or other conduct subject to the per se rule."
1040,7," Defendants also cite to Acquaire v. Canada Dry Bottling Co., 24 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 1994), Precision Piping & Instruments, Inc. v. 
E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co., 951 F.2d 613 (4th Cir. 1991), 49er Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 803 F.2d 1463 (9th 
Cir. 1986), and Smilecare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of Cal., Inc., 88 F.3d 780 (9th Cir. 1996). Each of these cases is 
distinguishable. Smilecare is a ยง 2 case, and the plaintiff alleged no agreement in restraint of trade. See 88 F.3d at 786 (holding 
that the plaintiff's ""failure to allege the essential element of conspiracy between [the defendant] and any other parties precludes 
a group boycott claim""). While Acquaire involved an allegedly anticompetitive agreement between a manufacturer and 
distributor, the policy challenged by the plaintiff in that case was not set forth in a written agreement. See 24 F.3d at 407-08. The 
same is true of 49er Chevrolet, 803 F.2d at 1467 (finding no agreement under ยง 1 between the defendant auto-manufacturer and 
its shippers where the alleged anticompetitive contracts made no reference to the challenged policies regarding dealer 
reimbursement for damaged cars), and Precision Piping, 951 F.2d at 615-18 (finding no agreement within the meaning of ยง 1 
where the alleged antitrust conspirators had no written agreement and there was no evidence that the defendants collaborated 
on the policy challenged by plaintiff). "
1041,8," Indeed, the evidence in the record suggests that many local sponsors never commented to the Tour about its Rules and 
Regulations. ((Centinela Hosp. Rep.) Peterson Depo. at 24:17-25:4; (Grand Slam Charities Rep.) Kramer Depo. at 67:22-68:11; 
((Gold Rush Classics Rep.) Bell Depo. at 35:19-25.)"
1041,9," Toscano invokes Volvo North Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l Prof'l Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55 (2d Cir. 1988), but, as the defendants 
point out, that case is distinguishable. In Volvo, a former sponsor of a men's professional tennis tour brought a ยง 1 claim against 
the tour, asserting that it conspired with other sponsors and tournament operators (not named as defendants) to prevent the 
plaintiff from sponsoring future tour events. Although the decision dealt principally with the issue of antitrust standing, see id. at 
66-70, the court went on to hold that the plaintiff adequately alleged a conspiracy within the meaning of ยง 1, see id. at 70-71. The 
court explained that ""courts have consistently held that, since joint ventures -- including sports leagues and other such 
associations -- consist of multiple entities, they can violate ยง 1 of the Sherman Act."" Id. In the court's view, the tour was no 
different from these defendants, since it consisted of ""representatives of national tennis associations, tournament owners and 
directors, and professional tennis players."" Id. at 71. Because no sponsors were sued in Volvo, the decision does not discuss the circumstances in which the sponsors of a sports 
league may be held liable under ยง 1 as co-conspirators of the league. Moreover, unlike the professional tennis tour at issue in 
Volvo, the Tour is not a joint venture, and the Tour's Board does not include representatives of sponsors hosting tournaments. 
See id. at 58, 67, 71. "
1042,10," The economic evidence advanced by Toscano is conclusory and unpersuasive. According to Toscano's expert, Dr. Tollison, 
""the economic theory explaining why the local tournament sponsors are involved in the anticompetitive combination in this case 
is simply that they contractually bind themselves to, and benefit from, the very aspects of the Senior PGA Tour's operation that 
are anticompetitive."" (Tollison Decl. at 15.) Tollison's declaration fails to explain, however, why the local sponsors have an 
economic interest in the eligibility and participation rules challenged by Toscano. HN6[
]"
1042,11," Because Carribean Cruise Lines acted as a local sponsor as well as a title sponsor, the analysis applicable to local sponsors 
applies equally to it. GM's situation differs from that of the other title sponsors because it contracted directly with the Tour to act 
as an umbrella sponsor for a series of tour events. However, neither of the two umbrella sponsorship agreements between the 
Tour and GM refers to the Tour's Rules and Regulations. (Fitton Decl. Ex. D; Fitton Decl. Ex. E.)"
1042,12," Toscano also cites as specific circumstantial evidence of concerted action among the defendants the fact that officers of title 
sponsor Pacificare served on the board of a local sponsor, whose other directors in turn were representative of other sponsors. 
According to Toscano, one of Pacificare's officers was also President of the local sponsor, and ""participated at an organizational 
board meeting where the topics of discussion included the agreements necessary to be entered into with the Tour."" (Pls.' Am. "
1043,," Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for S. J. at 26.) Even assuming the truth of these assertions, however, they do not support an inference of 
concerted action between Pacificare and the Tour to establish and perpetuate the Rules and Regulations. "
1048,1," The only remaining remand issue pending before the Court involves Lightner et al. v. Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, et al., Middle 
District of Alabama Case No. CV-99-A-784-N. The remand in the Lightner case is not being considered at this time because the 
Court has not yet received the record from the transferor court, has not yet assigned the matter a case number, and Defendants 
have not yet had an opportunity to respond to the pending motion. "
1050,2," HN5[
] If the Defendant shows that the relevant state law does not limit the plaintiffs damages to the amount pled, removal 
may still be an option. As observed by one commentator, ""if plaintiffs cause of action and the relief actually sought clearly involve 
a controversy in excess of the required amount, removal is not defeated by a monetary prayer for less than the amount."" 15 
Moore's Federal Practice, ยง 102.107[3] at 102.186.1 (Matthew Bender 3d ed). ""If the state court complaint alleges damages less 
than the jurisdictional amount, but state law does not limit the plaintiff to the amount pleaded, there is the specter of bad-faith 
pleading to avoid removal."" Id. The Court is aware of the split in the circuits as to the burden of proof a defendant must satisfy when a plaintiff pleads for less 
than the jurisdictional amount, but declines to follow the approach adopted by either the Eleventh or Fifth Circuits and instead 
follows the approach discussed in Gafford. The Eleventh Circuit has held that a plaintiffs allegations as to the jurisdictional 
amount are entitled to deference and a presumption of truth and therefore, to avoid a remand, the defendant must prove ""to a 
legal certainty"" that the plaintiffs claim must exceed the jurisdictional minimum. Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1092 (11th 
Cir. 1994). The Fifth Circuit applies a different burden of proof standard. In De Aguilar v. Boeing Co., 47 F.3d 1404 (5th Cir. 1995), which 
involved the crash of a Mexican airliner, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed a state court complaint alleging that the amount in 
controversy was less than the jurisdictional minimum for diversity jurisdiction and attached an affidavit which stated that the 
plaintiffs had agreed on an irrevocable cap on the amount of damages. The Fifth Circuit, observing that Texas law does not limit 
a plaintiffs damages to the amount set forth in the complaint, determined that it was necessary to address the fact that these 
""rules have created the potential for abusive manipulation by plaintiffs, who may plead for damages well below the jurisdictional 
amount in state court with the knowledge that the claim is actually worth more, but also with the knowledge that they may be 
able to avoid federal jurisdiction by virtue of the pleading."" Id. at 1410. To protect against such manipulation by plaintiffs, the 
Court set forth the following shifting burden of proof rule: ""if a defendant can show that the amount in controversy actually 
exceeds the jurisdictional amount, the plaintiff must be able to show that, as a matter of law, it is certain that he will not be able 
to recover more than the damages for which he has prayed in the state court complaint."" Id. at 1411. The defendant satisfies its 
initial burden under a preponderance standard. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff and becomes a ""legal certainty"" obligation; 
i.e., plaintiff can satisfy the burden by showing that state law prohibits recovery of a greater amount than that in the complaint, 
or, if there is no such law, plaintiffs can file ""a binding stipulation or affidavit with their complaints."" Id. at 1412. "
1052,3, The same language is found in the Gabriel Complaint P 106. 
1054,4," The Court is mindful of Plaintiff's attempt to distance himself from these statements at the hearing on this matter. Despite that 
attempt, the Court finds that the Sizemore complaint does make allegations of unjust enrichment and does include 
""disgorgement"" when discussing the items of recovery sought therein. "
1057,5," This result and analysis has been rejected by the Second and Seventh Circuits. See Gilman v. BHC Securities, Inc., 104 F.3d 
1418, 1428-31 (2d Cir. 1997) (where the Court observed that punitive damages may not be aggregated unless the plaintiffs 
underlying claims can be aggregated); In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 123 F.3d 599, 608-09 (7th Cir. 
1997) (where the Court observed that ""[a] plaintiffs award of punitive damages is not limited by awards made to previous 
plaintiffs complaining of the same act of the defendantโฆ. Whether it is a good rule or a bad rule it shows that the right to punitive 
damages is a right of the individual plaintiff, rather than a collective entitlement of the victims of the defendant's misconduct""). "
1058,6," Although Defendant Hoechst joins Defendant Andrx's arguments regarding diversity jurisdiction, it does not state what costs it 
will incur if required to comply with the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek. "
1063,7," Defendant Andrx also argues, in connection with the Lowy action, that diversity jurisdiction exists despite the fact that both it 
and Plaintiffs are citizens of Florida. Defendant bases its argument on the fact that Defendant Hoechst is a foreign entity and 
thus there is only a need for minimal diversity and not complete diversity under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a)(3). This Court finds 
Defendant's argument unpersuasive. Defendant's argument ignores the first part of ยง 1332(a)(3) which requires that parties be citizens of different states and that the 
foreign citizen be an ""additional party."" This point is illustrated In Transure, Inc. v. Marsh and McLennan, Inc., 766 F.2d 1297 
(9th Cir. 1985). There, the Court observed that the ""presence of an alien corporation on one side as an additional party does not 
defeat diversity jurisdiction."" Id. at 1298 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court reasoned, ""the presence of alien corporations 
on both sides of the controversy did not defeat diversity jurisdiction."" Id. at 1299. In other words, absent the alien parties, 
diversity jurisdiction existed. Construing the language of ยง 1332(a)(3), the Court determined that the addition of alien "
1064,," corporations on both sides would not defeat the diversity jurisdiction that already existed. Defendant's reliance on Dresser 
Indus., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 106 F.3d 494 (3d Cir. 1997) is misplaced. Dresser refutes rather than supports 
Defendant's position. In Dresser, the Court held that ""the language of section 1332(a)(3) grants federal jurisdiction when aliens 
are additional parties. The statute makes no distinction based upon which side of the controversy-plaintiff, defendant, or both-the 
aliens appear. Although the statute plainly requires that the dispute be between citizens of different states, it includes the phrase 
'additional parties' without any such limitation."" Id. at 497."
1064,8," In light of this Court's decision that jurisdiction is lacking, there is no need to address the collateral estoppel argument that 
Plaintiff raises in connection with this case. "
1069,1," GPC was formerly known as Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. and Gannett Pacific Newspapers, Inc."
1069,2," The State originally sought a temporary restraining order. However, the parties agreed at the hearing to convert the State's 
motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction."
1069,3," The Court observes that the State recently sought to eliminate the JOA when the legislature found that ""the original justification 
for the monopoly granted by the public in 1962 may no longer be true,"" and ordered the Advertiser and Star-Bulletin to disclose 
their financial records to the state attorney general. See Hawaii Newspaper Agency v. Bronster, 103 F.3d 742, 745 (9th Cir. 
1996). The Ninth Circuit held that Congress' passage of the Newspaper Preservation Act preempted the field. See generally 
Hawaii Newspaper Agency Ltd. Partnership v. Bronster, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1082 (D. Haw 1996); City and County of 
Honolulu v. Hawaii Newspaper Agency, Inc., 559 F. Supp. 1021 (D. Haw. 1983)."
1069,4, Section 1803 of the Newspaper Preservation Act provides: 
1070,," (a) It shall not be unlawful under any antitrust law for any person to perform, enforce, renew, or amend any joint 
newspaper operating arrangement entered into prior to July 24, 1970, if at the time at which such arrangement was first 
entered into, regardless of ownership or affiliations, not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the 
performance of such arrangement was likely to remain or become a financially sound publication: Provided, That the terms 
of a renewal or amendment to a joint operating arrangement must be filed with the Department of Justice and that the 
amendment does not add a newspaper publication or newspaper publications to such arrangement. (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to enter into, perform, or enforce a joint operating arrangement, not already in effect, 
except with the prior written consent of the Attorney General of the United States. Prior to granting such approval, the 
Attorney General shall determine that not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the arrangement is a 
publication other than a failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose 
of this chapter. (c) Nothing contained in the chapter shall be construed to exempt from any antitrust law any predatory pricing, any 
predatory practice, or any other conduct in the otherwise lawful operations of a joint newspaper operating arrangement 
which would be unlawful under any antitrust law if engaged in by a single entity. Except as provided in this chapter, no 
joint newspaper operating arrangement or any party thereto shall be exempt from any antitrust law."
1070,15, U.S.C. ยง 1803.
1070,5," The Court also observes that the JOA provides that the Star-Bulletin must obtain the consent of the Advertiser before it can 
assign its interest in the JOA partnership or any controlling interest of its capital stock, and that the Advertiser's consent must not 
be unreasonably withheld. However, the Advertiser is not required to obtain the consent of the Star-Bulletin prior to taking the 
same actions. See State's Motion, Oct. 8, 1999, Exh. A, at 36 - 37."
1070,6," Under the terms of the 1993 amendment to the JOA, if Liberty ceased publishing the Star-Bulletin, Liberty would not be entitled 
to receive the guaranteed annual profits. Instead, Liberty would receive the Star-Bulletin's name, its advertiser and subscriber 
lists, and $ 100. All other assets, including the printing and distributing infrastructure, would go to the Advertiser. See State's 
Motion, Oct. 8, 1999, Exh. A, at 31 - 32. "
1072,7," The Court need not address the state law claims separately because they essentially mirror the federal claims, see, e.g., 
Robert's Hawaii School Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., Inc., 91 Haw. 224, 247, 982 P.2d 853 (1999) (noting that the 
legislature followed the ""federal paradigm"" in fashioning Hawaii antitrust law and that the language of H.R.S. ยง 480-4 and ยง 
480-9 traces the language of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Act). The Court notes that if the federal claims lack merit, 
then the state law claims would be preempted by the Newspaper Preservation Act. See Hawaii Newspaper Agency v. Bronster, 
103 F.3d 742, 745 (9th Cir. 1996). However, the Court notes that daily newspapers are commodities within the meaning of 
H.R.S. ยง 480-1."
1072,8," The Court recognizes that the Ninth Circuit held in Hawaii Newspaper Agency v. Bronster, 103 F.3d 742, 748 (9th Cir. 1996), 
that the Newspaper Preservation Act ""contains no temporal limitation."" "
1077,9," At the hearing, counsel for Defendants expressed concern that any monetary recovery that his clients might have if they prove 
that the State has wrongly obtained injunctive relief is limited to the amount of the bond. In the event that the State does not 
confirm that any recovery by Defendants is not limited to the amount of the bond, and such confirmation is not filed within five (5) 
days of the date of this Order, the Court will reconsider the amount of the bond upon motion made by either party. "
1085,1, Exxon has made essentially identical arguments in opposition to plaintiffs' motion to remand.
1085,2," To the extent defendants rely on their contract, the Court notes that the contract itself contains an explicit provision that any 
unlawful provision shall be considered inoperative. Distributor Sales Agreement, para. 24."
1085,3," The Court recognizes that the issue on appeal involved only the trial court's denial of Chevron's motion for summary judgment. 
Plaintiffs' claims against the jobbers were not part of the appeal. 713 So. 2d at 788. However, if plaintiffs stated a cause of action 
against Chevron based upon its contract with its jobbers, then the Louisiana Antitrust Law would apply to all parties to the 
contract. The very nature of the antitrust claim alleges an agreement between these parties to restrain trade. La. R.S. 51:122. As "
1086,," the Louisiana appellate court recognized, all that is required to state a claim under the antitrust law are factual allegations that 
""the defendant is a party to a contract"" which unreasonably restrains trade. 713 So. 2d at 789."
1086,4," Vasquez v. Alto Bonito Gravel Plant Corp., 56 F.3d 689 (5th Cir. 1995); Dodson v. Spiliada Maritime Corp., 951 F.2d 40 (5th 
Cir. 1992). The Court notes that the Jefferson v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. lawsuit was removed from state court and then remanded 
by this Court despite Chevron's claim that its jobbers had been fraudulently joined. 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10334, 1994 WL 
396326 (Berrigan, J., E.D.La. 1994)."
1086,5," For an overview of LUTPA, see: Comment, Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act: Broad Language And Generous Remedies 
Supplemented By A Confusing Body Of Case Law, 41 Loy. L. Rev. Review 759 (1996)."
1086,6," Plaintiffs have also alleged claims under the Louisiana Price Discrimination Act, La. R.S. 51:331(apparently against Exxon 
only) and for ""unjust enrichment"" under Louisiana law. Because the Court has found that plaintiffs have alleged viable claims 
against the non-diverse defendant, Retif, under the Louisiana Antitrust Law and LUTPA, it is not necessary to discuss these 
remaining claims. "
1094,1," In the case of Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted Fifth 
Circuit law prior to September 31, 1981, as binding on the Eleventh Circuit. Other cases in the Eleventh Circuit have stated that only two claims exist under a ยง 2 claim, namely monopolization and 
attempted monopolization. See Ad-Vantage Tel. Dir. Consult. v. GTE Directories, 849 F.2d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir. 1987). 
However, Eleventh Circuit cases have addressed the conspiracy to monopolize claim as a separate claim. See Levine v. Central 
Florida Medical Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1555-56 (11th Cir. 1996) (giving elements of monopoly, attempted monopolization, 
and conspiracy to monopolize). The statute includes monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize. 
See 15 U.S.C ยง 2. Consequently, this court finds that binding precedent indicates that there are three ยง 2 claims as stated in the 
statute. HN9[
] "
1095,2," This ""aggregation of affect"" theory harks back to the Supreme Court's holding in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 87 L. Ed. 
122, 63 S. Ct. 82 (1942). HN10[
]"
1095,3," The court recognizes that the circuits are split as to the interpretation of which activities of the defendant must affect interstate 
commerce. See ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 32-33 (4th ed. 1997). The Supreme Court 
announced in McLain, ""To establish the jurisdictional element of a Sherman Act violation it would be sufficient for petitioners to 
demonstrate a substantial effect on interstate commerce generated by respondents' . . . activity."" McLain, 444 U.S. at 242. 
Confusion arose, however, when the Court went on to say, ""Petitioners need not make the more particularized showing of an 
effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates, or by those other aspects of 
respondents' activity that are alleged to be unlawful."" Id. These two comments by the Supreme Court have led to a circuit split 
over what activities must affect interstate commerce. Compare United States v. ORS, Inc., 997 F.2d 628, 629 n.4 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(noting that to meet the ""effect on commerce test"" the plaintiff had to allege that the defendant's business had a substantial effect 
on commerce) with Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 808-10 (1st Cir.) (finding that the 
defendant's ""unlawful activity"" must affect interstate commerce). The Eleventh Circuit has adopted the more lenient 
interpretation, requiring only that the defendant's general business affect interstate commerce. See Shahawy, 778 F.2d at 641."
1095,4," The Eleventh Circuit has found that ""the reach of the Sherman Act is coextensive with Congress' power under the Commerce 
Clause."" McLain, 444 U.S. at 241. Thus, the ultimate question for the court to ask when addressing a question of interstate 
commerce is whether Congress can prohibit the challenged conduct under the Commerce Clause. See Chatham, 597 F.2d at 
1008. "
1096,5," The court notes that the evidence of interstate commerce submitted by Alabama Ambulance does not evidence expenditures 
during the time period of the subcontract or contract. The contract between the City and CRHS commenced on September 9, 
1996, and was to run for 24 months. See Contract Exh. PP 1 & 8. The subcontract between CRHS and Alabama Ambulance 
commenced on November 18, 1996 and ended on August 17, 1997. See SubContract Exh. P 1."
1096,6," The court does note, however, that CRHS is a Georgia company doing business in Alabama."
1096,7," In Springs Ambulance Service, Inc. v. City of Rancho Mirage, et al., it was pled that ""medical supplies, ambulances and 
gasoline, manufactured and/or processed outside the state of California, are purchased in connection with the ambulance 
services provided"" by the parties to the suit. See 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13356, No. CV82-5917CBM, 1983 WL 1878, at *6 (C.D. 
Cal. Sept. 27, 1983), rev'd in part on other grounds, 745 F.2d 1270 (9th Cir. 1984). In addition, the plaintiff in Springs Ambulance 
alleged that the activities of the city and the other defendants ""affect the likelihood that persons and business presently located 
outside of California [would] seek employment or start businesses for the purpose of rendering ambulance services . . . ."" Id. at 
*7. Judge Marshall found that there was ""a sufficient nexus"" between the ambulance service and interstate commerce to support 
an federal antitrust claim. See id. "
1098,8," The court further notes that Alabama Ambulance does not address what the ""relevant market"" is in this case. Relevant market 
is an element of the monopoly claim. "
1099,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
1107,1," Because jurisdiction over consolidated pretrial proceedings lies in this transferee Court, we apply the Rules of Practice and 
Procedure of this district. See, e.g., Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 639 n.40, 11 L. Ed. 2d 945, 84 S. Ct. 805 (1964) 
(although HN1[
] transferee court must apply substantive law of transferor, ""the transferee District Court may apply its own 
rules governing the conduct and dispatch of cases in its court.""). As discussed below, however, the Court would reach the same 
result under the local rules of either court."
1107,2," Baum has abandoned the claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. See Memorandum In Support of [Baum's] 
Motion For Reconsideration And To Amend The Complaint (Doc. # 52) filed December 4, 1998 in Case No. Civ. A. 99-2112-

transferred [by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation] to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. 
Such transfers shall be made . . . for the convenience of parties and witnesses and [to] promote the just and efficient 
conduct of such actions. Each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such 
pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated: Provided, 
however, that the panel may separate any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such 
claims before the remainder of the action is remanded. "
1108,4," HN6[
] The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize motions for reconsideration. See Hatfield v. Board of County Comm'rs, 52 F.3d 858, 861 (10th Cir. 1995); Loum v. Houston's Restaurants, Inc., 177 F.R.D. 670, 671 (D. Kan. 1998). While 
the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the District of Kansas contain a provision entitled ""Motions to Reconsider,"" D. Kan. Rule 
7.3, this provision is intended to apply only to non-dispositive judgments and orders. See Loum, 177 F.R.D. at 671. 
Nevertheless, a motion to alter or amend is essentially a motion for reconsideration. See Hilst v. Bowen, 874 F.2d 725, 726 (10th 
Cir. 1989); Koch v. Shell Oil Co., 911 F. Supp. 487, 489 (D. Kan. 1996)."
1108,5," HN7[
] Eastern District of Michigan Rule 7.1(g)(3) sets forth a similar standard: Generally, and without restricting the discretion of the Court, motions for rehearing or reconsideration which merely present 
the same issues ruled upon by the court, either expressly or by reasonable implication, shall not be granted. The movant 
shall not only demonstrate a palpable defect by which the court and the parties have been misled but also show that a 
different disposition of the case must result from a correction thereof. E.D. Mich. Local Rule 7.1(g)(3). "
1109,6," The Court derives this factual background from the Michigan court's opinion which dismissed the Baum complaint. See Baum 
Research and Dev. Co. v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., 31 F. Supp. 2d 1016 (E.D. Mich. 1998). Where appropriate, the Court notes 
additional factual allegations set forth in the Baum Complaint (Doc. # 1) filed July 13, 1998 in Case No. Civ. A. 99-2112-KHV and 
Baum's [Proposed] First Amended Complaint (Doc. # 50) filed March 8, 1999 in this consolidated action, In Re Baseball Bat

1109,7," The analysis is the same for Baum's state antitrust claims and federal antitrust claims. See Mich. Comp. Laws 445.784(2) (in 
construing Michigan Antitrust Reform Act, courts shall give ""due deference to interpretations given by federal courts to

1124,12," The Government also points out that the Raiber claim is based not on the federal antitrust statutes but on New York's Donnelly 
Act. Nonetheless, there is still the potential for enormous overlap in discovery because the Raiber complaint's allegations are 
nearly verbatim to the allegations in the Government's complaint, indicating the claims are based on the same facts and

1124,15," 28 U.S.C. ยง 1407(g). The statute does not preclude consolidation of government cases brought under ยงยง 4A and 4C of the Clayton Act. See 28 
U.S.C. ยง 1407(g)-(h). Because a government entity bringing suit under these sections seeks damages, not an injunction, and 
therefore stands in a position similar to a private litigant, consolidation may be appropriate. See H.R. Rep. No. 90-1130, at 5, 8

limitation was requested by the Department of Justice and concurred in by the Coordinating Committee and the Judicial 
Conference of the United States, on the basis that consolidation might induce private plaintiffs to file actions merely to ride 
along on the government's cases. Government suits would then almost certainly be delayed, often to the disadvantage of 
those injured competitors who would predicate damages actions on the outcome of the Government's suit. Furthermore, 
since section 5(b) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)) tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of the 
Government's action, there is no need for injured competitors to join in the Government's suit. H.R. Rep. No. 90-1130, at 5, reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1902-03."

1126,20," The Government also argues that the public policy against consolidating government antitrust enforcement suits with private 
suits is demonstrated by courts' refusal to permit private parties to intervene in government antitrust suits. See, e.g., Sam Fox 
Publishing Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683, 689, 693, 6 L. Ed. 2d 604, 81 S. Ct. 1309 (1961) (emphasizing the 
""unquestionably sound policy of not permitting private antitrust plaintiffs to press their claims against alleged violators in the 
same suit as the Government . . . ."" even where the private litigants are aligned with the Government); United States v. 
International Business Machines Corp., 62 F.R.D. 530, 532 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). While these cases and others discuss generally 
the different purposes behind antitrust enforcement suits brought by the government and private antitrust suits, they involve 
different issues and considerations and are otherwise inapposite to the instant consolidation."
1126,21, See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1407(g).
1126,22," Neither the court nor any of the parties was able to locate a case in which there was any discussion of this issue much less a 
case in which a Government antitrust enforcement suit was consolidated for pretrial proceedings, over the Government's 
objection, with one or more private antitrust suits under Rule 42(a). That there are no such cases is not entirely surprising 
because such cases would only arise in instances where the Government objects to consolidation. In cases where the 
Government does not object to consolidation, the court cannot imagine a scenario where the defendants or the plaintiffs in the 
private damages suit would have convincing reasons to oppose consolidation."
1126,23," At an October hearing, Dentsply also argued that the multidistrict litigation statute presents a different context than 
consolidation under Rule 42(a); that is, the multidistrict litigation statute is concerned with transferring cases, and that there is a 
sense that the concern was to protect the Government's choice of forum. The short answer is there is nothing in the statutory 
language to support this argument. Moreover, the legislative history regarding the exemption only articulates concerns that 
permitting transfer and consolidation would encourage private tag-along suits and cause delay to the Government's cases."
1126,24," Class and damages discovery will take place following the conclusion of merits discovery on February 1, 2000."
1126,25," The nature of these tag-along private suits is such that there will always be strong reasons for consolidation under Rule 42(a) 
because there will be common issues of law and fact and considerable overlap in discovery between the Government action and 
the private actions. "
1127,26," While it did not result in any meaningful delay, one such dispute has already arisen between Hess and Dentsply."
1127,27," Dentsply did not move in the alternative to consolidate only the Hess and Raiber actions, and neither Hess nor Raiber has 
requested consolidation. The court assumes without knowing that the litigants concluded there was nothing to be gained by a 
partial consolidation. "
1133,1," The court observes that plaintiff does not seek a declaration that the patents are invalid or that its products do not infringe 
defendant's patents. However, since at this stage of the proceedings the court finds that plaintiff did allege an objective 
apprehension of immediate suit by defendant, the court need not address whether such a finding is required for plaintiff's patent 
misuse and estoppel declaratory relief claims. "
1145,1," For example, in August 1990, BYTE magazine stated: The latest incarnation of DR DOS, Digital Research's MS-DOS clone, is an innovative and intriguing operating system that's 
thoughtfully designed. Version 5.0 is also packed with the extra features that Microsoft's own operating system should have 
(and might eventually have if the long-rumored MS-DOS 5.0 becomes a reality). As the people at DRI make very clear, its 
not pronounced Doctor DOS, although the analogy isn't far off the mark, since it indeed cures many (but not all) of MS-
DOS's shortcomings. Stan Miastkowski, A Cure for What Ails DOS, BYTE, Aug. 1990, at 107 (Pl.'s Exhibit 69). PC Magazine wrote on January 15, 
1991: Digital Research is the microcomputer operating system company that predates Microsoft. As if to prove it hasn't lost its

1146,2," A ""beta"" or ""beta version"" refers to unreleased software still under development. Beta testing is both a common and necessary 
practice in the computer software industry. It involves allowing software users and manufacturers of other software that is 
compatible with the beta product to test the new product. Beta testers provide the software manufacture with needed feedback 
on its product including potential problems with operating the software. It also allows the makers of compatible software the 
opportunity to work out any incompatibilities between their product and the beta version before its commercial release. 
Ordinarily, this is a mutually beneficial arrangement between the beta manufacturer and the maker of the compatible software. 
The arrangement allows the compatible software manufacturer to cure incompatibilities while making the beta product more 
marketable since upon its release it would be compatible with an assortment of software programs. "
1147,3," As alleged by plaintiff, a FUD campaign is meant to attack or alter perceptions regarding software compatibility. The purpose of 
a FUD campaign is to raise an artificial barrier to entry by a competitor. Caldera alleges that Microsoft knew of the effect an 
effective FUD campaign could have on a competitors and offers as evidence the following statement by a Microsoft official, 
Jeremy Butler, made in September 1989: It only takes a couple of reports about non-compatibility to give the kiss of death to a PC: we've seen that on the hardware 
side as well as in the operating system area. (Pl.'s Exhibit 34). "
1148,4," During this same time period, and in response to the Novell/DRI merger plaintiff argues, Gates called Ray Noorda, Novell's 
CEO and Chairman, and proposed a merger between Novell and Microsoft. According to plaintiff, the only prerequisite for Gates 
was that ""DRI's got to go."" Plaintiff now asserts that Gates' proposal was ""a ploy to hobble the development of DR DOS as a 
competitor."" Microsoft asserts it was done in good faith. "

plaintiff appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On appeal, instead of considering whether the defendants had illegally attempted or conspired to monopolize the industry, the 
Ninth Circuit considered each defendants conduct separately and affirmed the determination made in the district court. The 
Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, remanding the case to the district court. The 
Court held, it is apparent . . . that the Court of Appeals approached Continental's claims as if they were five completely separate

manner designed to convince consumers that Aspen had only three mountains, not mentioning Aspen Highlands; (4)

stations"" in Count III (see id. at 22, P 155), is construed to mean ""jobber stations"" as defined in P 85. Specifically, ""jobber 
stations"" are stations owned and supplied by jobbers. Defendants supply these jobbers with Shell brand gasoline in bulk 
wholesale transactions. These jobbers and jobber stations therefore are different from Plaintiffs, who also obtain their gasoline 
directly from Defendants but lease their stations from Defendants and do not distribute to any other dealers. See id. at 10, P 85. "

Defendants brand of their gasoline from sources other than Shell at a discount; (3) allowing Plaintiffs to seek their own financing 
for ICRs with lower processing fees than those of Defendants; (4) failing to inform Plaintiffs ""that they would be competing with 
jobbers/OD's and Shell owned and operated stores who can purchase Shell gasoline at wholesale prices while requiring 
Plaintiffs to purchase the same Shell gasoline at retail prices""; and (5) failing to inform Plaintiffs of the high ""pre-printed rent"" 
and/or explain how rent obligations would be calculated. See First Amended Complaint, at 26, P 182. "
1189,7," The Supreme Court has indicated that HN5[
] in factually complex antitrust cases, district courts may require that facts be 
pleaded with reasonable particularity in order to permit an inference that a federal antitrust claim is cognizable. See Associated 
General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 n.17, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 
S. Ct. 897 (1983) (finding that in a factually complex antitrust case, ""a district court must retain the power to insist upon some 
specificity in the pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.""). "
1190,8," Plaintiffs appear to acknowledge that the case involves only branded gasoline, see Transcript of September 24, 1999 
Conference, at 18-19. This concession is appropriate since it is clear that unbranded gasoline is a materially different product. 
See C.E. Services, Inc. v. Control Data Corp., 759 F.2d 1241, 1246 (5th Cir. 1985) (quoting Brown Shoe v. United States, 370 
U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1523-24, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (recognizing that ""within [a] broad market, well-defined 
subdivisions may exist which . . . constitute product markets for antitrust purposes"")). "
1191,9," Because of its inquiry into market power, this test is actually ""located between a per se and a rule of reason inquiry."" See Roy 
B. Taylor Sales, Inc. v. Hollymatic Corporation, 28 F.3d 1379, 1382 (5th Cir. 1994)."
1191,10," Plaintiffs' claim under this theory is exactly the same as the claim at issue in Ajir v. Exxon Corp., 1995 WL 429234 (N.D. Cal. 
1995). In Ajir, independent Exxon dealers brought suit against the manufacturer Exxon alleging that Exxon illegally tied the use 
of Exxon-owned tanks, lines, and equipment to the purchase of Exxon brand gasoline. Id. at *4. The district court in that case 
found that the relevant market in that case was the market for gasoline franchises. Id. at *5; see also Wilson v. Mobil Oil Corp., 
940 F. Supp. 944, 950 (E.D. La. 1996) (relevant market was fast lube franchises); Collins v. Int'l Dairy Queen, Inc., 939 F. Supp. 
875, 880 (M.D. Ga. 1996) (relevant market was soft-serve ice cream franchises). "
1192,11," Plaintiffs do not make a serious attempt to make typical tying claim allegations, which include contentions about ""cross-
elasticity of demand between a given product and its substitutes."" United Farmers, 89 F.3d at 235, n.3 (citing PHILLIP E. 
AREEDA & DONALD F. TURNER; ANTITRUST LAW P 519a (1991))."
1192,12," The Kodak opinion had two discrete segments that addressed different theories of liability by the plaintiffs as to whether Kodak 
possessed sufficient market power in the tying market to sustain a Sherman Act ยง 1 claim. These segments form alternative 
bases for the Court's ultimate holding that summary judgment should not have been granted in favor of defendant Kodak. Under 
the first theory, the tying products were the unique replacement parts for the previously purchased Kodak copiers and the tied 
product was repair services for the Kodak copiers. Id. at 462-63, 464-65. In the second theory, the Supreme Court addressed 
Kodak's argument that the Kodak copiers, expensive items that were not easily replaceable, were the tying products and the tied 
product again was the repair service. The Court rejected Kodak's contention that the ยง 1 claim should fail because the company 
lacked appreciable market power in the copier equipment market. Id. at 465-79. "
1193,13," Plaintiffs' theory that Shell gasoline is tied to the ICR policy arguably could be analogized to the Kodak parts/services tie; 
however, Plaintiffs' tying claim would not survive under this portion of the Kodak reasoning. In Kodak, the aftermarket parts (the 
tying product) were indisputably unique and Kodak had a monopoly in that market. Plaintiffs' contention that Shell gasoline per 
se (or even the Shell trademark) is a unique product lacks merit under antitrust doctrines. Neither Shell gasoline nor the Shell 
trademark are legally recognized unique products for antitrust purposes. See discussion infra, 75 F. Supp. 2d 626, 1999 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 20352 at *43-44. Plaintiff lessee-dealers are restricted to Shell gasoline and the Shell trademark because of their 
contractual relationships with Defendants, not because the product or trademark is unique under the law. "
1194,14," Nothing in the United Farmers holding indicates that the Fifth Circuit would disagree that the relevant market in the case at bar 
is retail gasoline franchises generally or all branded gasoline, and not the markets as defined by Plaintiffs, the Shell trademark or 
Shell gasoline per se. In United Farmers, the Fifth Circuit pointed out that the plaintiffs had failed to allege that the Farmers' 
insurance products were unique or that consumers would pay more for that coverage. See 89 F.3d at 236. Since the plaintiffs 
had made no such allegations, there was no need for the court of appeals to analyze the next issue, namely, whether those 
allegations were legally sufficient to define a relevant market. There is no indication that the court of appeals intended to engage 
in this analysis. See and compare Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 479-80 (3d Cir. 
1990). Therefore, this Court concludes that the passing comment concerning lack of evidence of uniqueness of Farmers' 
insurance products is not meaningful precedent or support for Plaintiffs' claims that the Shell brand gasoline or trademark is a 
relevant tying product or that Plaintiffs' bald allegations of uniqueness are legally sufficient."
1194,15," The alternative holding in United Farmers also is consistent with the result reached here. The court of appeals, after rejecting 
the plaintiffs' proposed relevant market (electronic access to Farmers' policy information), assumed the validity of that proposed 
relevant market and held that Kodak did not apply. See 89 F.3d at 237. The court of appeals then decided, using for the sake of 
discussion the relevant product market of ""electronic access,"" that there was insufficient evidence of Farmers' market power in 
the tying market because the insurance market was so competitive. Engaging in a fact specific inquiry, the court held that the 
plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence of meaningful price discrimination or other evidence of market power. See id. at 237. The allegations in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint in the instant case command similar conclusions. Plaintiffs' proposed tying 
product relevant markets, i.e., Shell gasoline or trademark, are insufficient since a single brand of gasoline or a gasoline 
dealership franchise cannot constitute a relevant tying product. See infra 75 F. Supp. 2d 626, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20352 at 
*43-44. Second, like in United Farmers, Kodak does not apply to the facts at bar. Third, the logical inference from Plaintiffs' own 
allegations is -- contrary to Plaintiffs' intentions -- that there is a very competitive market for branded gasoline, the primary 
alleged tying product. Finally, Plaintiffs have made no allegations as to the existence of other gasoline brand dealerships (the 
true competitors of Plaintiffs) being provided with more favorable terms vis a vis ICRs and related credit processing. "
1195,16," The franchise contract did not specifically mandate that the plaintiffs purchase the ""dough"" from Domino's. Rather, defendant 
Domino's required the plaintiff franchisees to purchase various other ingredients. The plaintiffs contended that Domino's 
allegedly increased prices of items it controlled and thus rendered unprofitable plaintiffs' efforts to save costs by making their 
own dough."
1195,17," There is one district court case in this circuit that has declined to apply the rationale of Queen City Pizza. See Wilson v. Mobil 
Oil Corp., 940 F. Supp. 944, 950 (E.D. La. 1996). Responding to the defendant's claims that Kodak was inapplicable in the 
franchise context, the district court rejected the Queen City Pizza district court's holding, 922 F. Supp. 1055 (E.D. Pa. 1996), 
held that Kodak was applicable in a franchise situation, and that there was no ""principled distinction . . . between the franchise 
context and the durable equipment market involved in Kodak."" Wilson, 940 F. Supp. at 950. This Court respectfully disagrees 
with the conclusions in Wilson."
1195,18," There is a dearth of appellate analysis on the limits of Kodak or the effect of franchise agreements to antitrust claims. Plaintiffs 
have not proffered legal authorities that support their theories in light of longstanding antitrust principles. See Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 
15-16, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551; Town Sound and Custom Tops, 959 F.2d 468 at 475; Breaux Brothers, 21 F.3d 83 at 86. "
1197,19," Plaintiffs may attempt to bolster their contention that there is an unlawful tie because the two products (gasoline and ICR 
services) are offered together and therefore the consumer is induced to use them together for convenience. This argument 
however is futile. HN22[
] Offering convenience to the consumer does not demonstrate an unreasonable restraint on 
competition. See Roy B. Taylor Sales, 28 F.3d at 1385 (citing Hyde, 466 U.S. at 29-30) (""The fact that consumers might buy 
goods because of a convenience created by a tie does not suffice as evidence of an unreasonable restraint on competition.""). "
1198,20," Except for isolated words, such as Plaintiffs' defining the tied product as ICRs, id. at 21, P 147, Plaintiffs' Clayton Act ยง 3 claim

gasoline product which includes Shell's additive package thereby creating a Shell gasoline market. First Amended Complaint, at 11, P 88. Plaintiffs merely assert baldly in their Response that ""interstate promotions and

]"
1203,33," Hasbrouck involved facts similar to those at bar and thus is instructive in considering Plaintiffs' secondary-line claim. In 
Hasbrouck, Texaco sold gasoline to two distributors, Gull Oil Company (""Gull"") and Dompier Oil Company (""Dompier""). 496 U.S. 
at 549. Originally, Gull purchased gasoline at a lowest rate, because it sold unbranded Texaco gas under its own company label 
through various named stations. Dompier also received gasoline at a discounted price from Texaco, although not as low as Gull. 
Dompier re-sold its gasoline under the Texaco name. Id. at 549. Both Gull and Dompier picked up Texaco's product at the 
Texaco bulk plant and delivered directly to retail outlets. Id. at 550. Hasbrouck sold Texaco brand gasoline. The stations 
supplied by Dompier regularly sold at lower retail prices than independent stations supplied by Texaco directly, such as 
Hasbrouck. Id. at 550. Dompier later entered the retail gasoline business, allegedly at Texaco's urging. Id. The plaintiffs in "
1204,," Hasbrouck were twelve independent Texaco retailers, who displayed the Texaco trademark, bought their gasoline directly from 
Texaco, and took delivery of their gasoline directly from Texaco. Id. at 548. Texaco always charged a higher price to the plaintiffs 
than it charged to Gull or Dompier. See id. The independent retail dealers brought a Robinson-Patman Act suit. Texaco defended its pricing by arguing that the 
wholesalers, Gull and Dompier, deserved lower prices because they rendered services to Texaco, i.e., they earned ""functional 
discounts."" The Supreme Court analyzed ""functional discounts"" and ultimately affirmed the Ninth Circuit's endorsement of the 
district court's judgment based on a jury's finding that Texaco's differential pricing was illegal. The Supreme Court stated that: HN43[
] The [Robinson-Patman] Act contains no express reference to functional discounts. It does contain two affirmative 
defenses that provide protection for two categories of discounts -- those that are justified by savings in the seller's cost of 
manufacture, delivery, or sale, and those that represent a good faith response to the equally low prices of a competitor. Id. at 555-56 (footnotes omitted). The Court held that neither of these defenses was available to Texaco on the factual record 
before it. Id."
1204,34," The Supreme Court adopted the explanation of the legal status of functional discounts set forth in the Report of the Attorney 
General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 208 (1955). See Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. at 560-61. The Committee's 
explanation in pertinent part was: The Committee recommends, therefore, that suppliers granting functional discounts either to single-function or to integrated 
buyers should not be held responsible for any consequences of their customers' pricing tactics. . . . The price cutting of a 
customer who receives this type of differential results from his own independent decision to lower price and operate at a 
lower profit margin per unit. The legality or illegality of this price cutting must be judged by the usual legal tests. In any 
event, consequent injury or lack of injury should not be the supplier's legal concern. On the other hand, the law should tolerate no subterfuge. For instance, where a wholesaler-retailer buys only part of his 
goods as a wholesaler, he must not claim a functional discount on all. Only to the extent that a buyer actually performs 
certain functions, assuming all the risk, investment, and costs involved, should he legally qualify for a functional discount. 
Hence a distributor should be eligible for a discount corresponding to any part of the function he actually performs on that 
part of the goods for which he performs it. Id. (quoting Report, at 208) (footnotes omitted)."
1204,35," Prior to Hasbrouck, the Second Circuit had held that in order to bring a secondary-line claim of price discrimination, a plaintiff 
must allege (and eventually show) that the defendant's price differential existed between entities competing ""at the same 
functional level, i.e., all wholesalers or all retailers, and within the same geographic market. See Best Brands Beverage, Inc. v. 
Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 578, 585 (2d Cir. 1987). However, in Hasbrouck, the Supreme Court rejected the proposition 
that ยง 2(a) of the Clayton Act provided a safe harbor for any and all functional discounts. 496 U.S. at 563; see also George Haug 
Co., 148 F.3d at 142. "
1205,36," The Second Circuit recently stated that in "" FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 49, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948), a 
secondary-line price discrimination case, the Supreme Court determined that the Robinson-Patman Act was 'especially 
concerned with protecting small business' and that therefore section 2(a) 'was intended to justify a finding of injury to competition 
by a showing of injury to the competitor victimized by the discrimination.' (quoting S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 4)."" 
George Haug Co., 148 F.3d at 142. The Fifth Circuit would appear to subscribe to this reasoning. In M.C. Manufacturing Co. Inc, 
v. Texas Foundries, Inc., 517 F.2d 1059 (5th Cir. 1975), the Fifth Circuit reversed a judgment awarded plaintiff on a secondary-
line Robinson-Patman Act claim. Id. at 1061. The court of appeals held that the allegedly discriminatory sales were not made ""in 
competition,"" and therefore, plaintiff's Robinson-Patman Act claim failed as a matter of law. Id. at 1066. The court went on, 
however, to state that: Antitrust legislation is concerned primarily with the health of the competitive process, not with the individual competitor who 
must sink or swim in competitive enterprise. But as a necessary incident thereto, it is concerned with predatory price cutting 
which has the effect of eliminating or crippling a competitor. For surely there is no more effective means of lessening 
competition or creating monopolies than the debilitation of a competitor. "
1206,," Id. at 1067-68 (quoting Atlas Building Products Co. v. Diamond Block & Gravel Co., 269 F.2d 950, 954 (10th Cir. 1959) 
(emphasis added))."
1206,37," The Court notes a superficial inconsistency between the longstanding Third Circuit rulings in J.F. Feeser, Inc., 909 F.2d at 
1531, and Stelwagon Mfg. Co., 63 F.3d at 1272, on the one hand, and a recent opinion by another panel in that Circuit in 
Crossroads Cogeneration Corp. v. Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc., 159 F.3d 129, 141 (3rd Cir. 1998), on the other hand. In 
Crossroads Cogeneration, the panel held that to state a claim under the Robinson-Patman Act, a plaintiff must allege facts to 
demonstrate that (1) the defendant made at least two contemporary sales of the same commodity at different prices to different 
purchasers; and (2) the effect of such discrimination was to injure competition."" See Crossroads Cogeneration Corp., 159 F.3d 
at 141. The panel stated that a plaintiff must demonstrate that ""the effect of such discrimination was to injure competition,"" and 
rather than stating that the requirement was proof that there is a ""reasonable possibility"" that competition was harmed, as 
provided by Morton Salt. However, Crossroads Cogeneration does not represent the appellate panel's conscious rejection of the 
earlier Third Circuit rulings in J.F. Feeser, Inc. or Stelwagon Mfg. Co., that a Robinson-Patman Act claim is supportable upon 
proof of a substantial price discrimination between competitors over time and thus the application of Morton Salt. See, e.g., 
Stelwagon Mfg. Co., 63 F.3d at 1272. The Crossroads Cogeneration opinion addressed the Robinson Patman Act claim only in 
a cursory manner. It did not cite Stelwagon Mfg. (which gave detailed analysis to the issue of the applicability of the Brooke 
Group Ltd.). Indeed, Crossroads Cogeneration merely focused on the absence of any meaningful allegations by the plaintiff 
concerning the effect on competition. Similarly, the Tenth Circuit's language in Black Gold, Ltd. v. Rockwool Indus., Inc., 729 F.2d 676, 680 (10th Cir. 1984), could be 
construed to conflict with the newer rulings cited in the text accompanying this footnote. However, the Tenth Circuit in Black Gold 
Ltd. emphasized that it had a unique circumstances before it ( Id. at 681) and there was no need to address the effect on 
competition issues since they were not raised or implicated in the facts before that court. In any event, since the facts in Black 
Gold, Ltd. were materially different from those at bar, that holding is not persuasive authority in this case."
1206,38," However, HN49[
] allegations in a response to a motion are not sufficient to amend the complaint. See Shanahan v. City of Chicago, 82 F.3d 776, 781 (7th Cir. 1996). As indicated below, Plaintiffs are instructed that they must allege more precisely in a 
second amended complaint their theories of liability for each Plaintiff."
1206,39," Plaintiffs allege that these discriminatory pricing practices cannot be overcome and ""result[] in the substantial lessening of 
competition in the retail gasoline market and the substantial lessening of competition between Plaintiffs and the favored buyers"" 
in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 23, P 159. Plaintiffs contend that as a result of 
the discriminatory pricing, the Plaintiffs' ""ability to compete with Shell jobbers at the retail level has been impaired, resulting in 
lost sales and profits, as well as other damages, including being forced out of the Shell-branded gasoline market.' Id. at 23, P 
160. "
1207,40," Plaintiffs allege that the difference in price does not constitute a reasonable reimbursement for actual marketing functions performed by the jobbers. 
The jobbers are dual distributors, selling Shell gasoline both at the wholesale and retail levels, however, the substantially 
lower price given to jobbers greatly exceeds the value of the additional functions they perform. The added functions 
performed by the jobbers do not result in actual costs, legal risks and/or investments that would justify the deep discount 
enjoyed by the non-lessor retail stations. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 15, P 119. Plaintiffs also allege that: Shell has engaged in the practice of giving jobbers a substantial and preferential discount on the price of Shell gasoline. 
Shell jobbers purchase Shell gasoline at Shell terminals . . . . The rack price paid by Shell jobbers is substantially lower . . . 
than the dealer tank wagon (""DTW"") price charge by Shell to Shell Dealers. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 14, P 111. "
1208,41," HN50[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."
1208,15, U.S.C. ยง 1.
1208,42," At the Court's September 24, 1999 hearing, counsel for Plaintiffs agreed with the Court's statement that Count IV of Plaintiffs' 
complaint alleged discrimination among retail sellers of Shell gasoline. See Transcript of September 24, 1999 conference [Doc. 
# 50], at 18-19."
1208,43," Plaintiffs allege a simple outline of a conspiracy. First, Plaintiffs allege: Shell and certain ""favored dealers"" and jobbers have entered into agreements in which Shell uses discriminatory pricing 
practices to charge higher prices for gasoline to Plaintiffs than to these ""favored"" dealers and jobbers. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 23, P 164; at 25 PP 175, 176. Plaintiffs also allege in their Amended Complaint that: 
""Beginning at least in 1995 and continuing to the present, Shell has engaged in the practice of giving jobbers a substantial and 
preferential discount on the price of Shell gasoline."" Id. at 14, P 111. Plaintiffs then allege ""on information and belief,"" that ""Shell 
and its jobbers have entered into agreements regarding the price to be charged Plaintiffs, so as to exclude Plaintiffs from 
purchasing fuels at competitive wholesale prices."" Id. at 23, P 165. Plaintiffs add that ""jobbers consistently refuse to sell Shell 
branded gasoline to Plaintiffs, apparently either by agreement with Shell or upon fear of retaliation by Shell."" Id. at 16, P 121. 
Thereafter, Plaintiffs allege that these alleged agreements between Shell and its jobbers ""restrain trade in an anti-competitive 
manner."" Id. at 25, P 176. "
1209,44," This per se rule does not extend to sellers' imposition of maximum prices on their distributors. See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 
U.S. 3, 118 S. Ct. 275, 282, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (overruling Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. 
Ct. 869 (1968), which held that vertical maximum price restrictions were per se illegal). Claims involving vertical maximum price 
restrictions are now analyzed under the rule of reason. 118 S. Ct. at 285."
1209,45," To the extent that Plaintiffs attempt to allege that agents and officers of Shell conspired with Shell, their claim fails as a matter 
of law. See Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 486 (5th Cir. 1984) (""a point well established in this 
circuit is that HN55[
] a corporation cannot conspire or combine with its own officers, employees, or wholly owned sales 
divisions and outlets in violation of section one""); accord Crosby v. Hosp. Authority of Valdosta and Lowndes, 93 F.3d 1515, 
1526 (11th Cir. 1996)."
1209,46," In Cernuto, a manufacturer of cabinets decided to discontinue its supply to plaintiff, a retail cabinet outlet (Cernuto).  Id. at 165. 
Cernuto alleged that the manufacturers' decision was based on a request by one of its retail competitors. This competitor 
allegedly complained because plaintiff sold cabinets for a substantially lower price. In finding that the restraint fell under the per 
se rules, the Third Circuit stated that: "
1210,," HN56[
] When a manufacturer acts of its own, in pursuing its own marketing strategy, it is seeking to compete with other 
manufacturers by imposing what may be defended as reasonable vertical restraints . . . . However, if the action of a 
manufacturer or other supplier is taken at the direction of its customer, the restraint becomes primarily horizontal in nature 
in that one customer is seeking to suppress its competition by utilizing the power of a common supplier. Id. at 168 (emphasis added)."
1210,47," In fact, Plaintiffs' pleadings indicate that the pricing policy originated with Defendants, as Plaintiffs state that ""jobbers 
consistently refuse to sell Shell brand gasoline to Plaintiffs, apparently either by agreement with Shell or upon fear of retaliation 
by Shell."" Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 16, P 121"
1210,48," This lack of involvement by retail competitors distinguishes this case from those cases cited by Plaintiffs, Klor's and General 
Motors. In Klor's, the parties did not contest the fact that the boycott was brought at the suggestion of the plaintiff's retail 
competitor. See Klor's, 359 U.S. at 209 (""Broadway Hale [plaintiff's retail competitor] has used its 'monopolistic' buying power to 
bring about this situation.""). Likewise, in General Motors, the competing retail dealers complained to the manufacturer about their 
competitor's use of discounted retail prices. See General Motors, 384 U.S. at 133."
1210,49," This conclusion is consistent with the maxim that ""antitrust law shows more concern to protect inter rather than intrabrand 
competition."" Bogan v. Hodgkins, 166 F.3d 509, 515 (2d Cir. 1999) (citing NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., U.S. 525 U.S. 128, 119 
S. Ct. 493, 497-500, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998)). Accord Jayco Systems, Inc., 777 F.2d at 320 n.48 (finding that plaintiff failed to 
demonstrate an anti-competitive effect on interbrand competition). "
1211,50," Plaintiffs also complain in passing in their Sherman Act ยง 1 claim about the ICR policy. See Plaintiffs' First Amended 
Complaint, at 26, P 179. For this allegation to be consistent with the rest of Plaintiffs' claims in Count IV, Plaintiffs would have to 
allege that the retail stations with whom they compete are not saddled with this allegedly cumbersome tying agreement. Plaintiffs 
have not made any such allegations."
1211,51," In fact, Plaintiffs allege that, ""The jobber stations sell gasoline to the public at a lower price than the lessee-dealers can sell 
their gasoline because of the lower price jobber stations pay Shell for the gasoline."" Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, at 14, P 
112. Later, Plaintiffs state ""Shell sells gasoline to the public at company-owned stations at retail prices which are at times lower 
than the dealers' 'break even' price."" Id. at 16, P 122. If anything, the net effect of these allegations is that Defendants' scheme 
has resulted overall in a lowering of retail prices, not anti-competitive conduct resulting in the raising of prices."
1211,52," If anything, Defendants' actions resemble an attempt to set the maximum retail price of Plaintiffs' retail competitors. Vertical 
agreements to set maximum prices are no longer per se illegal. See supra, note 47. "
1224,1," More particularly, Defendants argue: the Hospitals did not purchase or smoke cigarettes or suffer direct injury as a result of the defendants' alleged misconduct. 
Rather, the Hospitals allege that certain Medicaid and other indigent patients suffered ""smoking-related"" injuries from using 
defendants' products and that the Hospitals were indirectly injured when they provided medical services for those patients. 
The Complaint must be dismissed because as this Court explained less than four months ago, the law has been clear for 
more than 150 years that ""[a] plaintiff who complaint[s] of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visiting upon a third 
person by the defendant's acts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover."" Williams & Drake, slip op.

Hospitals, as well as the smokers, and that as a result the Hospitals ""did not take, or would have taken sooner, actions 
to minimize the losses resulting from tobacco-related injuries and diseases and to discourage and reduce cigarette . . . 
use and costs associated therewith."" Amended Compl. P 300; see also Amended Compl. PP 64, 66, 304, 311. But no 
matter how the Hospitals plead their claim, their alleged injury remains derivative because the Hospitals did not suffer 
any loss unless and until the smokers suffered an injury that required treatment. Defendants' supporting Brief, p. 4, citing, Williams & Drake Co., Inc. v. American Tobacco Co., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

the Hospitals are in precisely the same position as the employer in Williams & Drake and the union trust funds in 
Steamfitters II and Laborers Local II - they suffered no direct injury, but merely incurred the costs of injuries allegedly 
suffered directly by smokers who sought medical treatment. As the Second Circuit succinctly concluded, because such 
'economic injuries . . . are purely derivative of the physical injuries suffered by [individual smokers],' the plaintiffs' alleged 
injuries are 'too remote as a matter of law for them to have standing to sue defendants'.""). "
1225,2," The Steamfitters court summarized the allegations contained in the plaintiffs' complaint as follows: the plaintiff funds allege that they were defrauded by the defendants -- tobacco companies and related industry 
organizations -- into paying for their participants smoking-related illnesses, as well as prevented by these defendants from 
informing the funds' participants about safer smoking and smoking cessation products. The defendants allegedly conspired 
to prevent the funds from obtaining and using information that would have reduced the incidence of smoking -- and 
therefore of illness -- among the funds' participants. Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 917. "
1233,3," In toto, PP 376 and 377 of Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint state:"
1233,376," . The Hospital Plaintiffs acted unofficiously, were required by law and/or morality to provide such health care, did not 
volunteer to provide such health care free of charge, intended to charge for such services and reasonably expected to be 
reimbursed their usual and customary fees to provide such services."
1233,377," . The [Hospital Plaintiffs] have expended sums to diagnose and treat tobacco-related illnesses caused by Defendants' 
wrongful conduct and for which the Defendants had, and continue to have a duty to pay, but have avoided paying by deceit, 
mendacious lobbying efforts, propaganda, scorched-earth and illicit and deceptive litigation tactics and other means. The 
Defendant Tobacco Companies knew or reasonably should have known that the Hospital Plaintiffs would be required to 
bear health care costs attributable to Defendants' conduct. Defendants knew of and appreciated the benefits that the 
Hospital Plaintiffs' bearing of such health care costs conferred on Defendants. At no time did the Defendants, or any of 
them, inform the Hospital Plaintiffs that Defendants would not reimburse the Hospital Plaintiffs for the cost of treating the 
Hospital Plaintiffs' Medicaid, medically indigent and non-paying patients despite Defendants' knowledge that the health care 
expenses that the Hospital plaintiffs incurred to treat tobacco-related illnesses were caused by the Defendants' wrongful 
conduct and that the Hospital Plaintiffs would reasonably expect to be paid for their services. Under these circumstances, 
the Defendants impliedly promised to pay the hospital Plaintiffs for their valuable services rendered as a result of their 
wrongful conduct, and it would be inequitable, unconscionable and unjust not to enforce their implied promise. First Amended Complaint, PP 376-77. "

1270,3," This does not render subsection (d)(1) superfluous. In the more typical case, one common carrier railroad will be seeking to 
cross the line of another. In that scenario, Board approval will be required and subsection (d)(1) will come into play."
1270,4," I am mindful of the possibility that BarTech might not actually intend to construct its proposed rail line, but is using the threat of 
doing so to induce the C&BL to lower its tariff rates. Whether or not this is a feasible strategy (the C&BL would likely have to 
change its tariff for all shippers), it still is not the same as one shipper's direct, litigation-based attack on a carrier's rates that 
could result in price discrimination and implicate the filed rate doctrine. "
1271,5," To the extent that defendant's antitrust arguments are meritorious, only the antitrust claim can be dismissed, leaving the 
pendent state law claims for further adjudication."
1271,6," This standard applies regardless of whether treble damages are sought under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15, or

1272,7," I ""recognize that the existence of antitrust injury is not typically resolved through motions to dismiss."" Schuykill, 113 F.3d at 
417. But, as in that case, the issue truly is a pure question of law, and the construction of a factual record could not change the 
result. Hence, the court sees little reason to put the parties to the time and expense of discovery on this issue. "
1276,*, Honorable Alice M. Batchelder recused herself from this case after oral argument was heard. 
1278,1," See, e.g., Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 801-02 (2d Cir. 1994) (holding that anesthesiologist lacked antitrust standing to 
challenge exclusive contract awarded to competing group of anesthesiologists); Oksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, "

of Cal., 805 F.2d 866, 871 (9th Cir. 1986). "
1282,*," Appeals No. 99-1014 and 99-1197 were orally argued. The other two appeals were submitted on the briefs on October 15, 
1999, because the court concluded that a second oral argument on the same subject was unnecessary. "
1306,1," To the extent Randall has attempted to name Nelson as a defendant on this cause of action--because he alleged that the 
Hospital, ""by and through James O. Nelson,"" discharged Randall as a CRNA ""without cause"" in violation of his rights to equal 
protection and due process, see Complaint, P 20--the court finds that the grounds for summary judgment asserted by the 
Hospital apply equally to Nelson. However, the court cannot find that Randall has asserted any constitutional claim against the 
other defendants, the Clinic Foundation and Pritchard. The allegations of elements of the claim in Randall's first cause of action 
all identify ""Defendant Buena Vista County Hospital"" or ""the hospital"" as the actor. See Complaint, PP 20 (discharge of Randall 
by the Hospital ""by and through"" Nelson), 21 (the Hospital acted under color of state law), 22 (the Hospital had no proper reason 
for discharge and acted ""contrary to the notion of due process""), 23 (the Hospital failed to provide Randall with equal protection 
and due process), 24 (the Hospital discharged Randall without due process thus depriving him of his property interest in public 
employment), and 25 (the Hospital acted with malice and reckless disregard to Randall's civil rights). There is no specific 
reference in this count to conduct of the Clinic Foundation or Pritchard. The reallegation in this cause of action of facts stated in 
paragraphs one through eighteen of the Complaint, see id. at P 19, also does not indicate that Randall is attempting to assert a 
constitutional claim against either Pritchard or the Clinic Foundation, when the only defendant specifically asserted to have 
violated Randall's constitutional rights is the Hospital. Instead, paragraph 19 simply reiterates the factual context for the 
constitutional claim against the Hospital and/or Nelson. Therefore, the court will not address the defendants' arguments for 
summary judgment on the constitutional claim against Pritchard and the Clinic Foundation, because there is no such claim 
against those defendants. "
1307,2," Randall does not argue in his resistance to the summary judgment motion that he was deprived of equal protection of the law, 
i.e., that he was treated differently from similarly situated individuals owing to a racial or other class-based animus, although he 
makes a passing reference to deprivation of equal protection in his Complaint. See Complaint, P 23 (""Defendant Buena Vista 
County Hospital failed to provide plaintiff the equal protection and due process as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendments to the United States Constitution; and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.""). Because Randall has ignored any ""equal protection"" 
claim, while arguing strenuously for the sufficiency of his ""due process"" claim, the court understands Randall to be asserting only 
a ""due process"" constitutional claim in his first cause of action in this litigation."
1307,3," In Graning, the court explained that HN6[
] ""[a] public employee with a protected property interest in continued employment 
receives due process if there is notice and an opportunity to respond to charges of misconduct before her termination and if 
posttermination administrative review procedures are available."" Graning, 172 F.3d at 616. The purpose of the pretermination 
hearing is to provide ""'an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.'"" Wallin, 153 F.3d at 690 
(quoting Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545-46). However, ""the pretermination process need not be elaborate, especially if there are 
meaningful postdeprivation procedures."" Graning, 172 F.3d at 616 (citing Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542-47). Furthermore, the 
hearing need not precede the decision to terminate the employee; rather, it must only precede the termination of the employee's "

1341,3," Several terms from the definition of ""attempted monopoly"" were defined in the present tense, including the terms ""exclusionary 
conduct,"" ""monopoly power,"" and ""relevant market."" The definition of ""exclusionary conduct"" included the phrase ""legitimate 
business justification,"" which, in turn, was also defined in the present tense. During jury deliberations, the jury asked whether the 
three elements of attempted monopoly were ""independent or dependent of each other."" The trial court referred the jury to the 
charge, but when the court received a second question asking whether ""all 3 factors have to apply,"" the court responded, ""Yes."""
1341,4," Because threat of injury was not established, we need not address whether, under the Texas Antitrust Act, Chromalloy was 
required to also demonstrate irreparable injury. "
1358,1," The court notes that neither party even addresses this prong of the test in brief. At oral argument, the Defendant argued that 
there were too many dealers to make an agreement possible or economically reasonable."
1358,2," Prior to Colgate, the leading case on price maintenance was Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 
55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911). Dr. Miles held that minimum resale price maintenance was per se unlawful. See id. In Dr. 
Miles, the court was concerned that price maintenance restricted ""the freedom of trade on the part of dealers who own what they 
sell."" Id. at 407-08."
1358,3," The Supreme Court has frequently narrowed the Colgate doctrine, but has never overruled the precedent. See, e.g., 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) (White, J., concurring); United

Monsanto case revitalized Colgate. "
1359,4," Parke Davis involves an action against a drug manufacturer alleging that the drug manufacturer conspired with retail and 
wholesale druggists to maintain wholesale and retail prices of the manufacturer's pharmaceutical products. Parke Davis would 
send out a catalog with a ""Net Price Selling Schedule"" listing suggested minimum resale prices.  Parke Davis, 362 U.S. at 32. 
The catalog also stated that it was Parke Davis' ""continuing policy to deal only with drug wholesalers who observed that 
schedule . . . ."" Id. The government argued that Parke Davis by ""entwining the wholesalers and retailers in a program to promote 
general compliance with its price maintenance policy went beyond mere customer selection and created combinations . . . to 
enforce resale price maintenance . . . ."" Id. at 37-38. The court found that the Parke Davis program ""clearly exceeded the 
limitations of the Colgate doctrine . . . ."" Id. at 45. Parke Davis used the ""refusal to deal with the wholesalers in order to elicit their 
willingness to deny Parke Davis products to retailers and thereby gain the retailers' adherence to its suggested minimum retail 
prices."" Id. Parke Davis also violated the Colgate doctrine by discussing the policy with its wholesalers and retailers before 
implementing it. Id. at 46. "
1362,5," Citing Belk-Avery for any other proposition in this case would be fruitless as Belk-Avery is so factually dissimilar from the 
present case."
1362,6," The court notes that even in Carlson the court did not determine that the activity of the manufacturer rose to the level of illegal 
activity. The court found that the dispute between the parties was not related to the pricing policy. See Carlson, 678 F.2d at 
1261."
1362,7," Because Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is due to be granted, no trial will be held in this case. Consequently, the 
Defendant's Motion to preclude Damages Evidence at trial is MOOT. "
1371,1," The complaint (corrected) alleges that BSC has unlawfully monopolized, or attempted to monopolize, the market for IVUS 
catheters and consoles in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 (Count I); 
violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A (Count II); breached the licensing agreement (Count III); breached the implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing (Count IV); and has been unjustly enriched (Count V). The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that HP 
is no longer required to make payments under the licensing agreement (Count VI), as well as treble damages and attorneys 
fees. "
1372,2," U.S. Patent No. 5,361,768. Patents for related technologies, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,485,846; 5,592,942; and 5,759,153, have since

1390,1," At some point, ATI also employed switching services in New York. "
1395,2," ""Writ refused, n.r.e."" is not the same as ""writ refused,"" in the writ history of Texas appellate cases. Only an unqualified ""writ 
refused"" must be treated as on equal footing with other Texas Supreme Court precedent. See Texas Jurisprudence, 3d ยง 145. "
1396,3," For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the SCT's refusal of a permit to ATI suffices to show exclusion from the 
Mexican market. This assumption is made without deciding that such a refusal shows a permit was legally required, but only that 
one was not readily available. Had one been easily available and a mere ""formality,"" then it would not make sense to 
characterize Mexican law as protectionist. "
1398,4," Neither side cites the regulation that such disclosure violates; however, no party disputes that such disclosure is illegal without 
permission. "
1399,5," This is not to say that the factfinder could not ultimately conclude that the relevant market for antitrust liability is the Mexican 
long-distance market. Our characterization of Telmex's business and our determination that the actions of Telmex and the other 
defendants had a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on the U.S. export market for switching services does "
1400,," not preclude the factfinder from making an independent determination of the relevant market for the purposes of antitrust liability. 
Cf.  Doctor's Hospital of Jefferson, Inc. v. Southeast Medical Alliance, Inc., 123 F.3d 301, 311 (5th Cir. 1997). "
1403,6," A number of other contacts are also put forward, mostly involving Telmex paying for services that were provided by 
corporations in Texas or the U.S. Such services included consulting and finance services. To the degree these contacts involve 
Texas, they add little to the issue; to the degree they are with other states, they are irrelevant at this juncture. Other contacts, 
such as Telmex being listed on the NYSE, or designating a NY agent for service of process are also not very informative. "
1412,1," It is worth noting that the Defendants do not concede this point, and have submitted a significant amount of evidence from 
which it could be concluded that Roniger's situation at OSDC had become precarious well before he was ever deposed -- as the 
result of deterioration of the working relationship between him and Scanlon. Indeed, ""vent"" notes dutifully recorded by Roniger 
detail his growing dissatisfaction with Scanlon's managerial tactics and travails, and with the marginalization of his own role at 
OSDC, many months before he testified in the Westmeyer Lawsuit. "
1413,2," Of course, it might be observed that application of such an ""exception"" is merely another way of finding that the employee or 
officer of a corporate entity was not truly operating in the ""scope"" of his or her employment, but rather went beyond the scope of 
his or her employment by making decisions based on exclusively personal interests. "
1414,3," Indeed, many of the cases in which the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine has been found not to apply are cases involving 
claims of racial or other invidious discrimination. See Quinn, 53 F. Supp. 2d at 360 (finding that police officer who abused plaintiff 
officer based on his sexual orientation pursued ""personal interests wholly separate and apart from the entity,"" and that ""personal 
interest"" exception to doctrine therefore applied); McCraven v. City of Chicago, 18 F. Supp. 2d 877, 884 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (holding 
that police department's race-based treatment of plaintiff was ""sufficient to take this case outside the intracorporate immunity 
doctrine""); Salto v. Mercado, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5796, *6, No. 96 C 7168, 1997 WL 222874, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 24, 1997) 
(""Here, Salto alleges that defendants conspired to physically abuse and falsely arrest him in retaliation for complaining of police 
misconduct and for filing a civil lawsuit. These allegations, if true . . . would demonstrate that the defendants were motivated 
solely by personal bias.""). "
1419,1," The complaint originally named the Commission itself as a defendant but, in response to an Eleventh Amendment objection, 
the members were substituted as defendants. "
1420,2," Topco may no longer be good law for its broader proposition that such a restraint is condemned per se even where it is 
ancillary to a productive joint venture. Cf.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 20-24, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551

1421,," cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1033, 93 L. Ed. 2d 834, 107 S. Ct. 880 (1987). But no one doubts that an independent agreement 
between private parties to limit output or divide markets is to be condemned per se. See Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc., 498 
U.S. 46, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349, 111 S. Ct. 401 (1990)."

1422,4," In theory, the three-store limit might or might not affect price, depending on the extent of existing competition in specific local 
retail markets where (absent the limit) those who have three stores elsewhere in the Commonwealth might choose to operate. 
But energetic defense of the statute by MPSA is some indication that its members fear that more competition from larger chains 
would drive down price, improve service, or both. "
1423,5," In Daggett we were concerned that the district court might possibly have been misled by our own language in Moosehead 
Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips Corp. 610 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 1979), suggesting that only a limited number of ""cubbyholes"" 
existed for claims of inadequate representation. See Daggett, 172 F.3d at 113. In the present case, while the district court's 
decision cites Moosehead, it also makes clear that the court did not impose any artificial limitation on the way in which parties 
may show inadequate representation. Massachusetts Food Ass'n, 184 F.R.D. at 222-23. "
1440,1," At all relevant times, appellee Daniel H. Foley, Jr. was the dealer-principal of Metro. "
1441,2," After an audit of Metro's books, Ford sought to charge back to Metro$ 3.1 million of allegedly improperly obtained CPA 
pursuant to a provision in Ford's Sales and Service Agreement with Metro. While this lawsuit was pending in the trial court, the 
TMVB case proceeded. On March 5, 1998, a final order was signed prohibiting Ford's proposed CPA charge-back for the 317 
trucks on which Ford claimed Metro misrepresented the name of the purchaser and dismissing Metro's protest of unreasonable 
discrimination under the motor vehicle code. The order further provided that Metro's franchise agreement with Ford be 
terminated after Metro's business was sold for an amount to be determined by an appraisal as described in the order. The order 
is currently on appeal before the Austin Court of Appeals. "
1442,3," Metro brought the federal antitrust claims under section one of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, and section 2(a) of the 
Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(a)."

1442,5," Although Metro has not identified the particular section of the Texas Antitrust Act under which it brings its claims, the only 
section that is arguably applicable to Metro's claims is section 15.05 (a). "
1444,6," In its fifth issue presented, Metro complains about the trial court's restriction on Metro's argument and evidence with respect to 
Ford's liability and the proper measure of damages. It also complains about the trial court's failure to limit Ford's evidence and 
argument relating to Metro's profits. Although Metro generally contends these alleged errors contributed to the jury's improper 
damage award, Metro does not provide any argument or authority with respect to why these particular trial court rulings were 
error and how these alleged errors resulted in an improper verdict. HN8[
] Bare assertions of error without argument or authority waive error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(h)."
1444,7," Having concluded that Metro was collaterally estopped as a matter of law from pursuing its state antitrust claims, we need not 
address Metro's third issue requesting a JNOV for punitive damages under that cause of action. "
1445,8," Section 38.001 permits the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees in addition to the amount of a valid claim based on an oral or 
written contract. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.  ยง 38.001(8) (1997)."
1445,9," Additionally, Metro claimed it was entitled to summary judgment on Ford's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair 
dealing asserting Texas does not recognize such a tort. On appeal, Ford does not address this ground for summary judgment 
and instead focuses on Metro's arguments relating to Ford's damages. The failure to present any argument on Metro's 
alternative ground for summary judgment on Ford's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing results in waiver. 
See Martin v. Cohen, 804 S.W.2d 201, 202 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ). Accordingly the trial court's judgment 
with respect to this cause of action will not be disturbed. "
1458,1," One narrow exception to this market participant requirement is for parties whose injuries are ""inextricably intertwined"" with the 
injuries of market participants. See McCready, 457 U.S. at 484 (granting standing to psychologists to challenge restrictions for 
psychotherapeutic services). This test requires that the plaintiffs are a ""necessary means to achieve the conspirators' illegal end 
as well as an integral and inextricable part of the anticompetitive scheme."" Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 740 F.2d 739, 746 (9th 
Cir. 1984). The injury to plaintiffs is not ""inextricably intertwined"" with the tobacco companies' unlawful activities. The injuries 
sustained by plaintiffs were incidental to the alleged scheme of the defendants, and occurred in a completely distinct market. "
1460,2," The Fisons decision does not require a contrary result. In Fisons, a physician whose reputation was injured had standing to sue 
a drug company for unfair and deceptive practices by failing to warn the physician of known dangers of its drug. In Fisons, the 
Court relied on the unique relationship between drug company and physician. Plaintiffs have no similar relationship with the 
defendants. "
1464,1," The dealers also assert that SNE breached its dealership agreements and violated various state dealer protection statutes, and 
that both SNE and its sole shareholder, Ernest Boch, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 
U.S.C. ยงยง 1961 et seq. I confine my analysis to the sufficiency of the dealers' antitrust claim."
1464,2," I take the facts from the complaint and describe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. See Miranda v. Ponce Fed. 
Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1991)."
1464,3," The dealers paraphrase certain provisions in SNE's dealership agreement and other related documents. I quote from the 
documents, which were supplied by the defendants in support of their motion. See Beddall v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., 
137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998) (motion HN1[

reviews document referred to in the complaint if the plaintiff's cause of action depends on the document and the document's 
authenticity is not in dispute). "
1465,4," The plan elsewhere defines ""discretionary vehicles"" as ""vehicles to be used as demonstrators by Subaru of New England; 
vehicles to be used for major auto shows; vehicles set aside to assist dealers who, at the sole discretion of Subaru of New 
England, need assistance and vehicles delivered to VIPs."" Defendants' Joint Appendix, Tab B(3) (emphasis in original)."
1465,5," While some courts have suggested that a per se tying violation is a misnomer because ""some element of [market] power must 
be shown and defenses are effectively available,"" U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 593 n.2 (1st Cir. 
1993); see also Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 477 & n.8 (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc), 
the Supreme Court has continued to endorse a per se rule in the tying context. See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 
466 U.S. 2, 9, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (""It is far too late in the history of our antitrust jurisprudence to question the 
proposition that certain tying arrangements pose an unacceptable risk of stifling competition and therefore are unreasonable 'per 
se.'"")."
1465,6," HN2[

around for competitive life-cycle prices""). "

increases"" in the health-services fee and the cost of supplemental insurance. Lee, 23 F.3d at 19 n.10. In the present case, by 
contrast, the dealers have alleged that Subaru of New England had a strong economic incentive to conceal (and did in fact 
conceal) the tying arrangement -- and thus the true cost of a Subaru dealership franchise -- until after the dealers had signed 
their agreements. See First Am. Compl. (Doc. # 31) PP 147, 150, 153 at 43, 44, 45."

owned subsidiary of defendant SBC, a Delaware holding company. "
1482,2," SBC asserts that the Dunn & Bradstreet listing and the Internet job postings, reflecting ongoing presence in California, were 
mistakes. See SBC and SWBT Reply in Supp. of Mtn. to Dismiss, at 10-11. At oral argument SBC counsel responded to the 
assertion that SBC actively recruits for employment positions in California, see Nissen Decl., Exh. 4-6, by stating that ""an HR 
person in San Ramon [California]"" had made the mistake, which was corrected when plaintiff called it to SBC's attention. While 
no clarification was provided regarding by whom the human resources staff member was employed, the reference suggests that 
the employee worked at the behest of SBC. "
1484,3," Defendant SWBT argued in its papers that ""if the Court does not dismiss Covad's claims against SWBT, at a minimum, the 
Court should transfer them to Texas for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice. 28 U.S.C. ยง

1484,4," The Ninth Circuit in Cost Management stated that HN17[
] to show injury, a plaintiff must prove that his loss flows from an anti-competitive aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior, since it is 
inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from acts that do not hurt competition. If the injury 
flows from aspects of the defendant's conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition, there is no antitrust injury, even if 
the defendant's conduct is illegal per se. Cost Management, 99 F.3d at 949 n.13 (quoting Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir.), cert.

1485,5," The relevant market in Metro was the cellular telephone market -- a new market in which defendant NewVector had neither a 
years-long monopoly nor owned the only physical facilities by which the product could be supplied to all consumers. Rather 
defendant had managed to gain a seventeen-month ""headstart"" over other competitors. See Metro, 892 F.2d at 63. Pacific cites 
to other cases which are also distinguishable upon the facts or the posture of the case. See, e.g., United States v. Syufy 
Enterprises, 903 F.2d 659, 664 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding, after significant findings of fact and a trial, that plaintiff who bought out 
competitors had committed no antitrust violations); Adaptive Power Solutions v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 141 F.3d 947, 951 (9th

1486,6," The FCC in In re Applications of Ameritech and SBC, CC Docket No. 98-141 (October 8, 1999), at 107, asserted that, because 
of ""existing regulatory safeguards, [incumbents] do not have a significant ability to act"" on the incentive to conduct a price 
squeeze. Nonetheless, the FCC noted that incumbents do have an incentive to perform such a squeeze and did not definitively 
conclude that a price squeeze could not happen."
1486,7," The FCC had also issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) addressing line sharing. See In the Matters of 
Deployment of Wireline Services Offering Advances Telecommunications Capability, et al., CC Docket No. 98-147, et al. 
Memorandum and Order, and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 98-188 (August 7, 1998) (hereinafter NPRM). After 
reviewing the text of the document, the CPUC agreed with the conclusion that, ""the clear import of the NPRM is that different 
service providers are not currently permitted to offer services over the same loop."" In the Matter of PDO, at *8. The Commission 
agreed with the arbitrator's assessment that it was difficult to explain ""how an FCC question asking whether [line sharing] 'should 
be allowed,'"" could be interpreted as stating that line sharing is required. See In the Matter of PDO, at 9. "
1487,8," Defendant Pacific did not move to dismiss these causes of action for failure to state a claim, but relied on its contention that 
because the federal claims should be dismissed, the state claims should likewise be dismissed as a discretionary matter. The 
essential flaw in the state claims as they are currently framed is that they do not identify the actions taken or statements made 
by SBC, as contrasted with Pacific, which form the basis for the charges."
1487,9," Nine of 20 central offices which Pacific represented were without space in November 1997 and August 1998, were later found

1490,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except

1491,1," City and Texas Towing filed their notices of appeal to this court from the August 25, 1998 order."
1491,2," We find the district court's grant of Texas Towing's motion to  [*3] certify issues for interlocutory appeal, without explanation, an 
insufficient basis on which to certify any aspect of this case for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b). The certification 
order, and Texas Towing's underlying motion, insufficiently delineate the exact issues to be certified, given the unusual 
procedural posture of this case."
1491,3," We note that none of the parties urged summary judgment on Ordinances 82744 and 87775. We therefore question whether 
the district court's grant of partial summary  [*5] judgment as to those Ordinances was permissible under FRCP 56."
1491,4," The district court's dismissals of Stucky's ยง 1983 and antitrust damage claims are not challenged on appeal. Those dismissals 
therefore are unaffected by this opinion. We also lack jurisdiction over the district court's denials of summary judgment. A denial of summary judgment is not a final order 
and thus does not confer appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. See Landry v. G.B.A., 762 F.2d 462, 464 (5th Cir. 1985). 
Therefore, 1) the holding of the August 25 Order and the October 13 Judgment denying City's and Texas Towing's summary 
judgment motions as to Stucky's claims for injunctive relief under antitrust law; and 2) the holding of the October 13 Judgment 
denying Stucky's partial summary judgment motion in and so far as it claimed that ยง 14501(c) preempted municipalities from 
adopting single-vendor open-bid towing systems, are not properly before us. The district court is nevertheless free on remand to 
reconsider these holdings, or not, as it sees fit. "
1495,1," In addition to joining Sumitomo's Memorandum of Law and Reply Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss the 
Amended Complaint, Global submitted its own Reply Memorandum. "
1497,2," I recognize that Reading predates the Supreme Court rulings Associated Gen. Contractors and McCready. However, the 
Second Circuit's analysis in Reading is in line with the Supreme Court's remoteness analysis in the aforementioned cases and 
therefore provides valid precedential assistance in this case. See De Atucha v. Commodity Exch., Inc., 608 F. Supp. 510, 515 
n.18 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). "
1500,3," I do note that courts in this circuit have found standing for plaintiffs who trade in the same exchange market as defendants but 
who do not allege that they interacted directly with defendants. See, e.g., Strax, 524 F. Supp. at 938-40. These courts explain 
that application of the antitrust laws to the exchange system would be precluded if plaintiffs were required to allege direct 
interaction with defendants since ""it is impossible to show that a particular purchaser bought from a particular seller in such a 
context."" Id. at 940. These cases are inapposite to Ocean View's claim regarding defendants' cash market transactions because 
in the cash market context, it can be determined who purchased from whom. "
1509,*," Honorable Julian Abele Cook, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation. "
1510,1," The district judge who originally presided in the J & J Produce case denied Gustafson's motion to dismiss on the statute of 
limitations issue, specifically holding that the price-fixing conspiracy ""had been continuous at least until 1992"" and that plaintiff's 
fraudulent concealment claim ""has merit."" In December of 1994, plaintiffs in both cases settled with Gustafson's. Upon court 
approval of the settlement, Gustafson's was to pay $ 1.5 million to the class and provide cooperation in the action against the 
remaining dairies. In January, plaintiffs moved for approval of the settlement, but, before it could be granted, the J & J Produce 
case was transferred to the district judge who had the Morton's Market case, and the two cases were consolidated. After much 
delay, on October 30, 1997, the district judge, without oral argument, granted the Dairies' motions for summary judgment on the 
statute of limitations issue. Almost a year later, the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement with Gustafson's. "
1511,2," Of course, suit may also be brought more than four years after accrual of the antitrust cause of action if the statute is tolled for 
some reason."
1511,3," The district court also found that there were none, characterizing evidence of a price-fixing conversation in 1988 as ""isolated 
and ambiguous."" In weighing the evidence, the district court found a fact against plaintiffs in violation of Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P."
1511,4," The court, however, did not point out what this evidence was. "
1512,5," Of course, after the development of the evidence, the jury will ultimately determine these facts."
1512,6," Defendants concede plaintiffs may tack together the periods during which the statute was tolled by the various government 
proceedings against each of these defendants."
1512,7," This issue is only relevant to plaintiffs' claims against T.G. Lee Foods, Inc., Borden, Inc., Flav-O-Rich, Inc., and the Southland 
Corporation. Gustafson's pled guilty to fixing commercial prices so the tolling effect of Section 16(i) is not at issue. Plaintiffs do 
not contend that Section 16(i) tolls the statute of limitations with respect to Pet Inc. or McArthur Dairy, Inc., both of which were 
not sued until 1994. "
1513,8," It is at this point that the parties exchange positions. Plaintiffs, who argued that they didn't learn about the price-fixing because 
price-fixing is nothing like bid-rigging, now assert that ""the link between the conspirators' school milk bid-rigging and commercial 
milk price-fixing is manifest."" The Dairies, who contended that bid-rigging was just one form of price-fixing, and that the bid-
rigging publicity notified plaintiffs that the Dairies were fixing prices, now argue that the bid-rigging charges involved ""an entirely 
different cause of action"" from the price-fixing claims. "
1514,9," The Dairies cite only two cases in support of their contention that there is no real relationship between their bid-rigging activities 
and their price-fixing activities. Neither case is helpful. In Peto v. Madison Square Garden Corp., 384 F.2d 682, 683 (2d 
Cir.1967), a conspiracy to monopolize boxing was not related to a conspiracy to monopolize hockey, especially since the ""only 
similarity between the two actions is found in the fact that some of the defendants are the same."" In Charley's Tour & Transp., 
Inc. v. Interisland Resorts, Ltd., 618 F. Supp. 84, 86 (D.Haw.1985), Section (i) did not apply because the two complaints alleged 
different markets, different defendants, different means of proof and ""wholly different actions on the part of the defendants as the 
basis for establishing liability."""
1514,10," This holding does not extend to Pet and McArthur. As to Pet's liability, see Section II. C. McArthur may be liable only on a 
theory of continuing conspiracy or fraudulent concealment, and then only if it was sued within four years of either the last 
purchase at a fixed price or plaintiffs' discovery of their claim against it. "
1516,11," Similarly, there are factual disputes on the issue of affirmative acts of concealment. One defendant's brief, for example, claims 
that there were no acts of concealment because the alleged false statements to customers regarding why milk prices were going 
up ""were, in fact, true."" This is a fact question that only a jury should resolve."
1516,12," The other cases cited by the Dairies are factually dissimilar but they also involve a plaintiff's earlier knowledge of the same 
wrong later sued upon.  Friedman v. Estate of Presser, 929 F.2d 1151, 1159-60 (6th Cir.1991) (later knowledge of role of 
informant known to plaintiff earlier); United Klans of America v. McGovern, 621 F.2d 152, 154 (5th Cir.1980) (statute of 
limitations not tolled in action for illegal investigation where Justice Department held a press conference to announce 
investigation of Klan and notified Klan of investigation prior to termination of statute)."
1516,13," We find no inconsistency between this holding and our earlier determination that the price-fixing allegations bear a ""real 
relationship"" to the prior bid-rigging allegations. Even though there was a real relationship between the Dairies' bid-rigging 
activities and their price-fixing activities, the newspaper stories were not sufficient, as a matter of law, to reveal this relationship 
to plaintiffs. "
1517,14," Since the publicized facts underlying the bid-rigging charges were not relevant to plaintiffs' price-fixing claims, and the court 
pointed to no other facts available to plaintiffs at that time, it appears that the district court's ruling was predicated on its belief 
that ""had they filed suit at any time between February, 1988, and February, 1992, the plaintiffs could have issued subpoenas, 
conducted depositions, and propounded interrogatories, as they did after 1993. The plaintiffs could have then formulated the 
basis for their current action."" Thus, the district court's suggestion in this case that plaintiffs should have ""filed first and 
investigated later"" seems contrary to Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P."
1517,15," In fact, in arguing that their denials of price-fixing to the Florida Attorney General do not amount to affirmative acts of 
concealment because that investigation was required by law to be secret, the Dairies assert that ""the information never entered 
the public domain."""
1517,16," Plaintiffs readily admit they did nothing to investigate their claims prior to the 1992 guilty plea by Gustafson's, because, they 
argue, they had no reason to suspect that they too had been victimized."
1517,17," See Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F.3d 346, 350 (2d Cir.1993) (""equitable tolling will stay the running of the statute of 
limitations only so long as the plaintiff has exercised reasonable care and diligence in seeking to learn the facts which would 
disclose fraud"")."
1517,18," Such a ""discovery"" accrual rule is commonly applied by the Circuits in securities fraud cases where the plaintiff's cause of 
action is held to accrue only when he reasonably should have discovered the fraud.  Klehr, 521 U.S. at 191, 117 S. Ct. 1984. "
1518,19," This objective standard accommodates the federal antitrust interest in expediting enforcement of economic competition with 
the federal judicial interest in avoiding groundless or premature suits. See Sterlin, 154 F.3d at 1202. "
1519,20," The district court did rely on these affidavits for its conclusion that plaintiffs were on notice that ""where there's smoke, there's 
fire."""
1519,21," Of course, the jury will ultimately determine what these plaintiffs should have known and when they should have known it."
1519,22," The exception is where a continuing conspiracy is alleged. Since a continuing conspiracy is alleged as one crime, a 
conspirator is still liable for the crimes of his co-conspirators even after his withdrawal, so long as he is sued during the 
limitations period. "
1520,23, The continuing conspiracy is the exception.
1520,24," These actions may also be timely-filed against both Pet and Southland on a theory of fraudulent concealment. Under this 
theory, they would be liable for all damages inflicted by the conspiracy so long as plaintiffs timely filed after they discovered or 
should have discovered their claims."
1520,25," In fact, as we have noted above, plaintiffs allege that Pet left in place the principal conspirators who continued to fix milk prices 
for the new owners. "
1521,26," Such a requirement would militate against withdrawal in some cases, thereby undermining the mitigation of danger to society 
which the defense is designed to encourage. "
1530,1," Plaintiff alleges a continuing violation of the antitrust laws dating back to 1989. The Supreme Court in Zenith Radio Corporation 
v. Hazeltine Research, Inc. explained how continuing violations are treated under the statute of limitations: Each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the Defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused 
by that act and . . . as to those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act. 401 U.S. 321, 339, 
91 S. Ct. 795, 806, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971) (citations omitted)."
1530,2," The exception to this is if the Plaintiff were injured during the statutory period as a result of conduct outside the statutory period 
where damages were speculative or uncertain at the time the act was committed. Zenith Radio Corp., 401 U.S. at 339, 91 S. Ct. 
at 806. "
1532,3," Though Plaintiff does allege that Defendants' conduct harmed ""Plaintiff and other HDPE manufacturers"" (Complaint PP 68, 73), 
Plaintiff does not identify these other manufacturers or even specify how many there are. The Court, therefore, does not 
consider Plaintiff to be a representative of a large group of manufacturers, but rather understands Plaintiff's claim to be that 
Defendant has targeted Plaintiff's product specifically. "
