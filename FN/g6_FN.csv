34,1, HGSI refers to this company as Rio Tinto PLC. 
35,2, A new entrant in the industry recently began mining operations in Montana.
35,3," The defendants dispute the plaintiffs' figures. Taking into account Grace's reserve estimates, the Brandy B property, and 
properties to which VVL had access or rights (the Dowell and R.E. Sansom properties), but which VVL claims could not be 
mined due to zoning ordinances and conservation easements, the low-end figure would be 67%."
35,4," The following summarizes Grace's 1970s Louisa County transactions. July 20, 1972: Grace acquires JONES properties (7 
acres); Dec. 27, 1972: Grace purchases two M.F. PEERS properties (Parcel I: 262.98 acres; Parcel II: 276.42 acres); Aug. 28, 
1973: Grace purchases HARRIS properties (5 acres); Nov. 21, 1973: Grace purchases LLOYD I properties (67.175 acres); Dec. 
10, 1973: Grace purchases LLOYD II properties (110.33 acres); Dec. 27, 1973: Grace purchases A.D. PEERS properties 
(Parcel A: 36.62 acres; Parcel B: 228.99 acres); Dec. 27, 1973: Unrecorded agreement for A.D. PEERS royalties; Dec. 27, 
1973: Grace leases the BRANDY A (""Hill"") property (60.242 acres); June 13, 1974: Grace purchases the DALTON property 
(12.6 acres); May 17, 1976: Grace leases the NININGER property (255.53 acres). In the 1980s, Grace purchased the 
CAMERON property (74.027 acres) (Apr. 12, 1982), and the AMCLUB property (18 acres) (May 10, 1989)."
35,5," As amended by the deed of correction dated August, 28, 1972. "
37,6," The following summarizes Grace's post-1991 transactions. Nov. 30, 1992: Grace quit claim deed of gift of M.F. PEERS parcel II 
to HGSI, and of JONES properties (containing restrictive covenants); Dec. 10, 1992: Drafts of a quit claim deed of gift and 
assignment of A.D. PEERS properties, including restrictive covenants; Dec. 22, 1992: Grace quit claim deed of gift of Grace's 
remaining Virginia properties, except A.D. PEERS, to HGSI (including seven parcels--LLOYD I, HARRIS, M.F. PEERS PARCEL 
I, AMCLUB, DALTON, LLOYD II, CAMERON) (restrictive covenants on all properties); Dec. 22, 1992: Grace assigns NININGER 
lease to HGSI (express, written prohibitions on mining); Dec. 22, 1992: Grace assigns BRANDY A lease to HGSI (express, 
written prohibitions on mining); Jan. 25, 1994: Grace deeds back A.D. PEERS ""Parcel A"" to A.D. Peers; Jan. 31, 1994: Grace 
quit claim deed of gift of A.D. PEERS ""Parcel B"" to HGSI (no written restrictive covenants); May 26, 1994: correction of quit 
claim deed--LLOYD I and HARRIS restrictive covenants modified only to forbid vermiculite mining, not all mining; Dec. 10, 1999: 
Release of all restrictive covenants by Grace and HGSI. "
38,7," The December 22, 1992 conveyance included the other M.F. Peers property (Parcel I), and the Lloyd I, Lloyd II, Harris, 
Amclub, Dalton, and Cameron properties. See note 6 supra. "
42,8," Following Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 543 (4th Cir. 1991), this court will address the 
second element in its consideration of whether the plaintiffs have evidence that excludes the possibility that the defendants 
acted with a legitimate business purpose, under the first element. "
43,9, See note 6 supra.
43,10," The defendants argue that all the restrictive covenants now have been released. However, the timing of the releases, less 
than two weeks before the defendants filed their original motions for summary judgment, could lead a reasonable trier of fact to 
conclude that the releases were not genuine and that a sub rosa understanding to prevent mining on the properties continues 
between the parties to this day. "
46,11," Although the court of appeals stated that HGSI must have ""known"" that anticompetitive effects would result, the court reads 
this statement as requiring that HGSI either have shared Grace's motives, or known of and acquiesced in them with the 
expectation that the restraints would have an anticompetitive effect. "
48,12," As discussed more fully below, defining a relevant market poses a great problem for the plaintiffs in light of this court's May 4, 
2000 opinion, which excluded the report and testimony of the plaintiffs' only proposed expert on antitrust economics. See 
Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co.-Conn., 98 F. Supp. 2d 729 (W.D. Va. 2000). "
49,13," The plaintiffs also cite much of the evidence tending to indicate that the defendants had anticompetitive motives. The present 
inquiry, however, is concerned with the effects of the restraint, not the motives behind them. "
51,14," VVL disputes that the property is ""available,"" because it alleges the Niningers have been unwilling to deal with VVL. For the 
purposes of the present inquiry, the uncertainty of whether the Niningers will make their reserves available to VVL reinforces the 
court's determination that it is not obvious that the restraint has had, or will have, any anticompetitive effect in the market."
51,15," For their ยง 2 claims, the plaintiffs must define a market they allege the defendants monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or 
conspired to monopolize. See Part II.B infra. "
52,16," At oral argument, Grace asserted that a party must present testimony by an antitrust economics expert as a matter of law, and 
that the court's exclusion of the report and testimony of Mr. Schwartz mandates dismissal of the antitrust claims that depend on 
market definition. Although an expert generally is used to establish the relevant market, see Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. 
Grace & Co.-Conn., 98 F. Supp. 2d 729, 736 (W.D. Va. 2000), there is no per se rule that an antitrust economics expert is 
required in all antitrust cases. However, as a practical matter and as discussed below, the plaintiffs' lack of any witness to testify 
about antitrust economics, or to rebut the defendants' economists, proves fatal. See generally Victus, Ltd. v. Collezione Europa 
U.S.A., Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d 772, 787 (M.D.N.C. 1998) (""Economic experts may not be required, but Europa has not provided 
affidavits of any witnesses who can address such questions . . . . No reasonable jury could find that a relevant market, as 
described by Europa, exists."")."
52,17," In its Horizontal Merger Guidelines, the United States Department of Justice uses a price increase of 5% lasting for the 
foreseeable future ""in attempting to determine objectively the effect of a 'small but significant and nontransitory' increase in 
price."" See Antitrust Division, U.S. Dep't of Justice, 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. 41552, at ยง 1.11 
(hereinafter the ""Guidelines""). But see id. (""However, what constitutes a 'small but significant and nontransitory' increase in price 
will depend on the nature of the industry.""). The plaintiffs and their now-excluded expert rely heavily on the Guidelines in 
attempting to propose a properly-defined relevant market. This reliance is misplaced in many respects (as detailed below), not 
the least of which is that, although this case does not involve a merger, ""the 'small but significant and nontransitory increase in "
53,," price' is employed solely as a methodological tool for the analysis of mergers: it is not a tolerance level for price increases."" Id. at 
ยง 1.0."
53,18," The plaintiffs argue that perlite is not a substitute for vermiculite because the prices of perlite and vermiculite move in opposite 
directions. Without a witness to testify about the economic significance of opposite price movement, this raw evidence cannot 
rebut the defendants' evidence of substitutability. The parties' respective evidence concerning the reasonable interchangeability 
of downstream substitutes with vermiculite is discussed in further detail below, with regard to the plaintiffs' ยง 2 claims. See Part 
II.B.1 infra. "
54,19," HGSI also argues the plaintiffs' proposed definition fails because it has not accounted for substitute uses of the land. HGSI's 
expert, Professor David Mills, testified that preservation competes with mining as an alternative use of the land. The argument 
essentially is that the proper market should be the broader ""land use"" market. Professor Mills claims that VVL and HGSI are 
""land use"" competitors, and that a hypothetical monopolist could not raise the price of mining rights above competitive levels 
without the buyers of land switching to an alternate use of the land, such as preservation. Professor Mills bases his conclusion 
on the following two statements: ""Vermiculite mining competes with a host of other land uses (agricultural, residential, etc.) for 
rights to use, transform, preserve, or develop land. Vermiculite mining rights are indispensable for some non-mining land uses 
for the simple reason that those uses are mutually exclusive with vermiculite mining."" (Mills Aff. at 4.) (See also Mills Report at 3 
(making the same statements).) These statements are not specific facts, do not set forth the specific facts on which they are 
based, and do not appear to be based on any specific data that would suggest vermiculite mining competes with other land uses 
or is indispensable for non-mining land uses; they are nothing more than ""conclusory statement[s] based on general antitrust 
theory."" M & M Med. Supplies & Serv., Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 164 (4th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (as 
amended). As such, the ""alternate land use"" claim by Professor Mills does not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 56(e). See id. at 166. "
55,20," The Fourth Circuit recognized these elements of monopoly leveraging in M & M Medical Supplies and Service, Inc. v. Pleasant 
Valley Hospital, Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 168-69 (4th Cir. 1993) (as amended) (en banc), but reserved judgment on whether monopoly 
leveraging is cognizable as an independent claim under the antitrust laws. See id. at 169. "
56,21," Undisputed record evidence confirms that there continue to be substantial vermiculite reserves available outside of Virginia. 
The plaintiffs acknowledge that even today there are unleased properties in South Carolina containing at least 2,000,000 tons of 
vermiculite concentrates--enough to last VVL's South Carolina division another fifty-seven years. It also appears that Montana 
now possesses commercially viable vermiculite reserves. A new domestic competitor recently shipped its first load of vermiculite 
from its mine and mill in Montana. "
57,22, The Fourth Circuit has not addressed the question of lock-in costs under Eastman Kodak. 
59,23," Defining a ""submarket"" entails no further complexity than defining a ""market""; whether any particular proposed market is called 
a ""market"" or a ""submarket,"" the plaintiffs' burden, and the inquiry for the court, is the same. See Satellite Television, 714 F.2d at 
355 n.5 (""The use of the term 'submarket' is to be avoided . . . a product group or geographic area either meets the listed criteria 
. . . or it does not . . . . No fiddling with nomenclature will change the analysis or result.""). "
61,24," Consequently, the court does not need to address the question of the Peers' antitrust standing, or the viability of their antitrust 
damages claims. "
62,25," HGSI cites Consul, Ltd. v. Transco Energy Co., 805 F.2d 490 (4th Cir. 1986), for the proposition that ยง 2 conspiracy claims 
require proof of a relevant market. In that case, however, the plaintiffs did not allege a claim for conspiracy to monopolize, but 
only monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. See Consul, Ltd. v. Transco Energy Co., 596 F. Supp. 432, 434 
(M.D.N.C. 1984). In stating that ""proof of a relevant market is always required,"" Consul, 805 F.2d at 494 n.9, the Fourth Circuit 
simply disagreed with the Ninth Circuit rule that proof of a relevant market is not always required in an attempt to monopolize 
case; the Supreme Court later rejected that Ninth Circuit view in Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993) (holding that attempt to monopolize claims require proof of the relevant market to establish a 
""dangerous probability"" of successful monopolization). "
63,26," The Fifth and Eleventh Circuits do not share the view of the Second,  Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. See Doctor's Hosp. of 
Jefferson, Inc. v. Southeast Med. Alliance, Inc., 123 F.3d 301, 311 (5th Cir. 1997) (""To establish Section 2 violations premised 
on attempt and conspiracy to monopolize, a plaintiff must define the relevant market.""); Bill Beasley Farms, Inc. v. Hubbard 
Farms, 695 F.2d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 1983) (""In this circuit it is clear that relevant market is a necessary element of a 
conspiracy to monopolize."") (citing Sulmeyer v. Coca Cola Co., 515 F.2d 835, 849 (5th Cir. 1975)). "
65,27," Section 4 provides, in relevant part, that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" HN29[
]  15 U.S.C.A. ยง 15(a) (West 1997). Section 16 provides, in relevant part, that ""any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be 
entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against 
threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" HN30[
]  15 U.S.C.A. ยง 26 (West 1997)."
65,28," VVL produced evidence that the price of mid-size concentrate increased by 55% (adjusted for inflation) from 1993 to 1998. 
However, in light of the defense economists' testimony that these higher prices were due to increased demand and increased 
costs, and VVL's absence of any economic testimony the price increase was not caused by these conditions, which are wholly 
consistent with a competitive market, no reasonable jury could conclude that these higher prices ""flowed from"" conduct that is 
proscribed by the antitrust laws. "
66,29," VVL's damages report, prepared by Mr. Sansom, refers only to production decline on the Brandy B property, due to the 
Brandy injunction, as supporting its claim of past lost production profits. On the second day of oral argument, counsel for VVL 
alluded to past lost profits due not only to production decline on the Brandy B property, but also due to VVL's having been 
denied access to the Peers, the Nininger, and Brandy A properties from 1992 to 1993, which VVL allegedly would have obtained 
at lower royalty rates and begun mining. Aside from two very brief, unsupported statements to this effect in VVL's opposition 
papers, (see Pls.' Opp'n at 30, 32), counsel's statement at oral argument was the only indication that VVL claimed past 
production losses for anything other than production decline on the Brandy B property. Those statements are unsupported by 
any record evidence, and are not referred to anywhere in VVL's August 1999 damages report. Moreover, on the first day of oral 
argument, counsel for VVL recognized that VVL did not include these past production profits in its damages calculations, and 
suggested that VVL purposefully did not do so. (See May 10, 2000 Tr. at 104 (""VVL would have had the Nininger and all other 
reserves much earlier. . . . It would have meant we would have had reserves at a lower royalty rate for a lot longer. . . . Had we 
presented damages on those assumptions, we would have gotten a much larger figure. We would have then been accused of 
running up damages. What we chose to do was to choose a more conservative alternative not following that scenario . . ."").) The 
court therefore construes VVL's past lost production profits claim as encompassing only the losses caused by a decline in 
production on the Brandy B property from 1993 to 1994."
66,30," Attempting to buttress the speculative nature of these future lost profits, VVL claims that it currently has a depreciated 
business value because it does not control the donated reserves, stating that ""any investment banker would conclude that VVL's 
worth is lessened by denial of access to reserves, and the denial of these reserves is a concrete present injury that . . . limits the 
amount VVL could be sold for today."" (Pls.' Opp'n at 33.) VVL produced no evidence from any investment banker to support 
damages for lost ""present business value,"" or ""going concern value,"" and did not refer to such damages in its damages report. 
Having no specific evidence to support this vague claim, VVL cannot recover damages based on a general depreciation of its 
current business value from its lack of control over more reserves than it currently possesses. "
71,31," VVL argues that Grace cannot argue that it would not have sold to VVL voluntarily had it not donated the property to HGSI, 
given the Fourth Circuit's statement that ""even if Grace lawfully could have donated the lands to HGSI without the nonmining 
agreements, it is foreclosed from challenging causation simply on the basis that it could have achieved the same result through 
lawful means."" Virginia Vermiculite, 156 F.3d at 540 (citing Lee Moore Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 599 F.2d 1299, 1302 (4th Cir. 
1979)). The question for the court is not what the defendants may argue at trial, but whether VVL has sufficient evidence to 
support its position. Therefore, the court need not interpret this statement by the Fourth Circuit at this stage of the proceedings. "
87,1," Defendant Network Solutions, Inc. filed a separate motion to dismiss for improper venue on the ground that plaintiff was bound 
by a contractual forum selection clause requiring that any lawsuit be filed in the United States District court for the Eastern 
District of Virginia, Alexandria Division. That motion was granted in an earlier opinion (See Doc. 52). "
91,2," The Court there found that the interchangeability of cellophane with other wrapping materials sufficed to make it part of the food 
wrap market."
91,3," Because plaintiff has failed to establish antitrust violations under ยงยง 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, the football defendants' 
contention that plaintiffs claims are barred due to the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine need not be addressed. "
118,1," The patent in question is United States Patent No. 5543001 referred to as the ""001 patent."" "
120,2," In this lawsuit, the plaintiffs cannot plead that they have exclusive right to use the patent since such an allegation implicates 
questions of inventorship that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court.  28 U.S.C. 1338(a)."
120,3, 15 U.S.C. 2. 
124,1," Minebea's allegations must be taken as true and correct for the purpose of determining whether it has failed to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted. Tuchman v. DSC Communications Corp., 14 F.3d 1061 (5th Cir. 1994). Phrases in the 
following narration of the facts that are in quotation marks reflect direct quotation from the allegations of the complaint. "
125,2," Section 1 provides that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."
125,3," Section 2 provides for liability of ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states. . . . "
126,4," The terms that are in ""bold"" reflect terms of art used by the courts in analyzing antitrust cases. "
128,5," This is perhaps the most significant language in the case. However, as will be seen below, this conflicts with the Antitrust 
Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property issued jointly by the Dept. of Justic and the Federal Trade Commission in 
1995."
128,6," The Fifth Circuit has recognized that the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal 
Circuit in appeals from district court decisions if the jurisdiction was based on patent laws, although it expressed some 
uncertainty as to whether the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction where the claims are mixed between patent and other 
laws. Marsh v. Austin-Fort Worth Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 744 F.2d 1077 (5th Cir. 1984). "
129,7," Whether a defendant must have demonstrated market power under Section One of the Sherman Act is in dispute; 
nevertheless, I will not need to reach this question since the Complaint adequately pleads the existence of market power. "
140,1," HN1[
] A relevant market by definition is one that includes ""products that have a sufficient competitive impact on the product 
of the defendant to be considered collectively in deciding whether the defendant possesses monopoly power."" Earl W. Kintner, 
Federal Antitrust Law, ยง 12.3."
140,2," HN5[
] For two products to be in the same relevant market, the price of one must affect the price of the other. Therefore, if 
service is supercompetitively priced, it would not usually be considered part of the market containing equipment absent a 
showing that Rolm's equipment was underpriced or that other factors compensated for the higher service cost. "
141,3," HN11[
] The Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over any patent issue, and it decides such issues under its own law. 
See  ISO II, 203 F.3d at 1325. Moreover, the Federal Circuit also decides any other issues raised as part of a patent case by 
applying the law of the circuit in which the district court that tried the case sits. Id. Thus, for those non-patent issues present in 
this case, the Federal Circuit will apply Eleventh Circuit law. "
142,4," In Kodak, the independent service organizations claimed that Kodak refused to sell them parts, thereby effectively shutting 
them out of the market of servicing and repairing Kodak brand copiers and micrographic equipment. Kodak defended on several 
grounds, including that parts and service are part of a systems market that includes the original equipment and that its policy 
was pursuant to legitimate business justifications. Kodak, 504 U.S. at 461-62, 112 S. Ct. at 2079-80."
142,5," Plaintiffs attempt to shoehorn Rolm's requirement that its customers promise not to resell parts into patent misuse. First, ISO II 
rejected any contention that Xerox's identical program constituted antitrust conduct. Second, HN13[
] for purposes of 
exceeding the scope of a patent grant, patent misuse is limited to those situations where the defendant either committed fraud 
on the patent office or engaged in sham litigation. See  ISO II, 203 F.3d at 1327. Because none of these actions is at issue here, 
there is no patent misuse for purposes of determining whether Rolm's conduct exceed the scope of its grant. "
143,6," Some PBX owners choose not to utilize either an ISO or Rolm for service, but instead self-service the equipment."
143,7," The other witnesses -- Mitchell Watson, Erik Halleus, and Elizabeth Herrell -- either asserted that Rolm manufactured all 
proprietary components itself or were unaware of whether Rolm prohibited outside vendors from selling to third parties. "
144,8," Moreover, even if Rolm Resale is a joint venture, HN21[
] for antitrust purposes a court may consider the separate 
participants a single entity where they organize themselves so as to pursue common interests. See Siegel Transfer, 54 F.3d at 
1127 (3d Cir. 1995); City of Mt. Pleasant v. Associated Elec. Coop., 838 F.2d 268, 276-77 (8th Cir. 1988)."

(N.D. Ga. 1997). "
145,10," As the Court discussed above, Rolm Resale is a Rolm subsidiary with Norstan acting as Rolm's agent. Accordingly, there 
could be no conspiracy even had the Court permitted the claim."

potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litigation, 214 F.3d

151,6," Defendants rely on two cases to support their position -- The Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1999) and 
Florida Seed Co. v. Monsanto Co., 105 F.3d 1372 (11th Cir. 1997). While both involve settings in which distributors were held 
not to have antitrust injury, their focus is on manufacturing monopolies, not a distribution market, which differentiates them from 
the present case. In Serpa, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied antitrust standing to a terminated distributor of plumbing supplies. 
There, plaintiff's supplier was purchased by defendant, a manufacturer that controlled 85 per cent of the relevant market. 
Defendant chose to distribute directly through one of the acquired companies, eliminating plaintiff as exclusive distributor. The 
decision denied antitrust standing because the terminated distributor was neither a consumer nor a competitor of defendant, and 
the ""loss is neither connected with nor resulted from defendant's market power in the [plumbing supply] industry."" The Serpa 
Corp., 199 F.3d at 12. Further: ""The terminations were an incidental matter which the merger may have made possible, but 
certainly did not cause."" Id. In addition, there were other competitors of defendant and high-volume consumers that could 
challenge the merger in place of plaintiffs. In the court's view, the relevant market was not distribution market, but the market for 
plumbing supplies. Florida Seed Co. also resulted in a finding that there was no antitrust injury. Plaintiff, a terminated distributor of herbicide, 
originally had a distribution contract with both manufacturers Ortho and Monsanto, which accounted for 100 per cent of the 
herbicide market. Under a FTC consent decree, Monsanto, after it acquired Ortho, was to divest itself of the herbicide ""Kleenup"". 
Plaintiff, a high-volume seller, argued it was terminated by Monsanto to devalue the ""Kleenup"" brand prior to divestiture. 
(Monsanto, as owner of Ortho and its ""Roundup"" product, would than have to compete with the new owner of the ""Kleenup"" 
product.) This decision followed others in denying antitrust standing to terminated distributors after a merger. Florida Seed, 105 
F.3d at 1375. It held that ""the proper parties to challenge Monsanto's acquisition of Ortho are direct purchasers in the herbicide 
market."" Id. The case is distinguishable because the court viewed the relevant market as the production of herbicide, not the 
distribution of herbicide. However, Monsanto, unlike defendant in Serpa, had no competitors at the time of the termination."
151,7," Plaintiffs have asked for the opportunity to take discovery and suggested that under the cases, a threshold dismissal would be 
premature. Given the economic configuration of the issues and the precedents for determining the standing issue at this stage, 
that request will not be granted. See Alpern v. Cavarocchi, M.D., P.C., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5929, Civ. A. No. 98-3105, 1999 
WL 357695, at *4 (collecting cases dismissing antitrust claims at the pleading stage)."
151,8," Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp reason that there can be no antitrust harm to vertical downstream monopolization by a 
first-stage monopolist (manufacturer) on several bases: There can be no ""double"" monopoly profit (monopoly profit is the 
intersection of its marginal cost curve and its marginal revenue curve (demand curve)); the potential is to lower prices and "
152,," increase output; and integration can produce economies (efficiencies and lower transaction costs). 3 Areeda & Hovenkamp at ยง 
756."
152,9," Plaintiffs refer to Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machine Co., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968) and 
Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) for the proposition that overcharged distributors as 
first purchasers have antitrust standing to pursue treble damages -- as opposed to the final consumer. However, those cases 
and their progeny involve the standing of distributors that are forced to pay higher prices and that in turn pass them on to 
consumers. The rule thereby created prevents both levels -- distributors and consumers -- from recovering duplicate and 
inconsistent judgments. See 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp, at P 371. Here, there is no overcharge issue because the distributors no 
longer deal in defendants' products. The only potential down-stream victim of a monopoly overcharge would be hospitals and 
doctors purchasing directly from the manufacturer. See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litigation, 214 F.3d 395, 401 (3d Cir. 
2000). "
160,1," The Seventh Circuit made its decision based on the factors set forth in the Restatement of Torts ยง 766B. The Arkansas 
Supreme Court followed the Restatement of Torts ยง 766B in Mason v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 333 Ark. 3, 11, 969 S.W.2d 160, 
165 (1998). "
165,1," It is well-settled that HN4[
] Rule 56 mandates summary judgment ""against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."" 
Celotex Corporation v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986). Furthermore, ""the mere existence 
of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could 
reasonably find for the plaintiff."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986). 
The record in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, did not permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that 
Defendants' conduct directly caused the damages allegedly incurred by Microbix. "
166,2," By separate Memorandum and Order, the Court has stricken the ""new evidence"" on the ground that Plaintiff fails to offer any 
legitimate justifications for not presenting the evidence before summary judgment."
166,3," Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, HN6[
] not every factual dispute between the parties will prevent summary judgment; the 
disputed facts must be material and must be facts which, under the substantive law governing the issue, might affect the 
outcome of the suit. Id. at 248. To withstand summary judgment, Plaintiff cannot rely upon speculation, but must present specific 
facts on each element of its case showing that there is a genuine issue of fact. As the Supreme Court stated in Matsushita 
Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., ""where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the 
nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'"" 475 U.S. 574, 587, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)."
166,4," For example, it is undisputed that the the FDA banned the import of human neonatal kidney cells on September 18, 1998, and 
that Gensia terminated its partnership with Microbix after the ban, in November of 1998. In the absence of contrary evidence, a 
reasonable inference could be made that the FDA ban was a substantial factor contributing to the lack of long-term supply of 
HNK cells, which materially caused Gensia to end the partnership. "
168,5," Contrary to Plaintiff's suggestion, HN9[
] an opportunity to be heard does not always require a hearing. It is, for example, well-
settled that motions to dismiss or for summary judgment can be resolved without requiring a hearing. "
213,1," This suit provides a concrete example of why the rule of Pennhurst is flawed. Here there is a matter arising from a ""common 
nucleus of operative facts"" that could be adjudicated with little difficulty in this forum on state law grounds. Prior to Pennhurst, 
similar cases were decided in such a way. See Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank, 22 U.S.(9 Wheat.) 904, 6 L. Ed. 244 
(1824). In at least one case during that time, federal constitutional claims were ignored in order to decide the case on state law 
grounds and avoid deciding unnecessary constitutional questions. See Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 213 U.S. 175, 
191, 53 L. Ed. 753, 29 S. Ct. 451 (1909). Unfortunately, that path is no longer available to lower federal appellate courts, 
because Pennhurst ""overruled the entire history of Siler/Ashwander doctrine in cases where injunctive relief is requested 
against the state."" Cuesnongle v. Ramos, 835 F.2d 1486, 1497 (1st Cir. 1987). "
227,1," Best Western had argued that Murcott did not possess a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy at 
the time of his discharge in 1995 because there was no public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine before the 
1996 effective date of the Arizona Employment Protection Act, A.R.S. section 23-1501. It now concedes, as it must, that the 
Arizona Supreme Court's decision in Cronin v. Sheldon, 195 Ariz. 531, 991 P.2d 231 (1999), precludes further reliance on that 
argument. Best Western had advanced that argument prior to the issuance of Cronin. "
228,2," See also Norman v. Recreation Ctrs. of Sun City, Inc., 156 Ariz. 425, 428-29, 752 P.2d 514, 517-18 (App. 1988)(holding that 
the discharge of an employee from a non-profit corporation allegedly resulting from a director's breach of fiduciary duties was not 
within the public policy exception to the at-will employment rule). "
230,3," We find instructive on this point certain aspects of federal employment discrimination law as prescribed in Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 United States Code, section 2000(e) et seq. Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a 
prerequisite to any civil action claiming adverse employment conditions against a federal employer. See Brown v. G.S.A., 425 
U.S. 820, 835, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 1969, 48 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1975); White v. G.S.A., 652 F.2d 913, 916-17 (9th Cir. 1981). The 
purpose of Title VII's exhaustion requirement is to encourage internal administrative conciliation and remedy of employment 
discrimination complaints. See, e.g., Ong v. Cleland, 642 F.2d 316, 318-19 (9th Cir. 1981)."
230,4," See also Ford v. Revlon, 153 Ariz. 38, 43, 734 P.2d 580, 585 (1987) (company liable for disregarding employee's purely

238,1," As we explain at length below, our earlier look at the voluminous record before the FTC was much too quick. Upon further 
review of the record we find substantial evidence that CDA's restrictions have procompetitive attributes. We particularly regret 
our error in light of the Supreme Court's reliance on our assessment of the record. See California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 
756, 781, 787, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935, 119 S. Ct. 1604 (1999) (Breyer, J., dissenting). "
239,2," Commentators analyzing the Supreme Court's opinion have emphasized that it does not absolutely require the fullest rule-of-
reason analysis in the instant case. See, e.g., Stephen Calkins, California Dental Association: Not a Quick Look but Not the Full 
Monty, 67 Antitrust L.J. 495, 519 (2000) (""The Ninth Circuit was directed, in effect, to give those justifications a second hearing. 
But CDA did not win that which it really sought: invocation of the full-blown rule of reason, complete with merger-type 
measurement of market power.""); William J. Kolasky, California Dental Association v. FTC: The New Antitrust Empiricism, 14 
Antitrust 68, 70 (Fall 1999) (""Many have expressed concern that California Dental may make summary disposition of antitrust 
cases, short of a full-blown rule of reason analysis, more difficult. The Court, however, goes out of its way to make clear that this 
is not its intent . . . . The point is simply that in California Dental itself, the Ninth Circuit needed to take a more careful ('more 
sedulous') look than it did."")"
239,3," In the instant case we opt for a particularly searching rule-of-reason inquiry in light of the plausibility and strength of the 
procompetitive justifications identified by the Supreme Court and CDA. See generally Kolasky, supra, at 70 (""Courts must apply 
a sliding scale, in which the amount of proof demanded of the plaintiff depends both on how obvious the anticompetitive effects 
appear and how strong or weak the proffered justifications are.""). "
240,4," The FTC's opinion below also based its conclusion that the CDA intended to restrain trade on a number of other statements by 
various CDA component officers. See In re California Dental Ass'n, 121 F.T.C. 190, 220-21 (1996). For example, the FTC 
opinion quoted a December 1987 statement by the executive director of one component, who forwarded a dentist's 
advertisement to the CDA, along with the following statement: This dentist is not in our area, Glendora is in the San Gabriel Valley component; however, if you wish me to handle this, I 
would be happy to do so, Italian style!!! Just let me know. These Drug Store Ads make me sick. Id. at 220. It is entirely unclear to us how this crude complaint about one ad registered by a single local officer evinces an intent 
on the CDA's part to restrain competition. Rather, the statement indicates the intensity of the author's opposition to certain kinds 
of advertisements without illuminating to any degree the basis for that opposition. The other statements quoted by the FTC 
opinion, while less colorful, are equally ambiguous with respect to the purpose of the CDA's restrictions on advertising. In its brief 
to us, the FTC wisely de-emphasized these supposed indicia of intent. By contrast, there is relatively unambiguous, albeit self-serving, evidence in the record indicating that CDA's motives in adopting 
advertising restrictions were benevolent. See infra note 5."
240,5," See, e.g., ER5D:7 (Dr. Lukens describing the function of the advertising restrictions as ""to protect the public from anything that 
might be false or misleading in any material way""); ER5F:7 (Dr. Hoo testifying that ""having a Code of Ethics and the Dental 
Practice Act protects the public more from advertising they might see that is misleading to them. And if you don't have that, then 
consumers, you know, will be misled by, you know, some unscrupulous people out there.""); ER5I:1 (Dr. Abrahams testifying that 
the dental advertising restrictions are intended to mimic the requirements of state law). "
243,6," The FTC also points us to a sentence and footnote in the Langenfeld and Morris article. This sentence reads: ""Studies of the 
price effects of advertising restrictions in professional occupations consistently have found that restrictions raise prices."" 
Langenfeld & Morris, supra. The sentence is followed by a footnote citation to ten studies, none of which analyzes the dental 
services market in detail, save Cox and Foster's. This single sentence hardly helps the FTC's cause. As we explain above (and 
as the Court above explained), the record before us does not support this kind of blanket generalizations about the effect of 
advertising restrictions as such in professional occupations writ large. Rather, different types of restrictions will have very 
different procompetitive or anticompetitive consequences, as will the same types of restrictions in different professional markets. "
245,7," The FTC's brief quotes Dr. Kinney's statement that ""that kind of ad would probably take two pages in the telephone book. 
Nobody is going to really advertise in that fashion."" But the substance of Kinney's response was that CDA would not require a 
dentist offering an across-the-board discount on all services to list the pre-discount and post-discount prices for every single 
discounted service because forcing a dentist to do so would be unreasonable. SER 541. In further testimony, Dr. Kinney clearly 
explained that CDA would not require such detailed disclosure: I can't imagine that there would ever be a circumstance in which you would have to have someone list all of their fees. Now, 
if they are offering a discount to senior citizens and this is an across the board discount for everything, it would be difficult to 
ask them to include all of these fees in this advertisement. In that case, I think you would have to be a little flexible and say 
okay, we are not going to require that you put every single fee that you are going to charge in [the advertisement]. FTC Record (Testimony) 13:1373. Dr. Kinney's testimony therefore contradicts the proposition for which the FTC cites it."
245,8," The ALJ found only that CDA's restrictions effectively barred the use of across-the-board discounts, not the use of all price 
discount advertising. Having read the testimony of Drs. Cowan and Kinney, we believe that even this more limited conclusion by 
the ALJ was erroneous. "
248,9," On the basis of this result, it is unnecessary for us to reach CDA's alternative contention on appeal, which is that the FTC has 
failed to demonstrate under rule-of-reason analysis that CDA exercises market power. "
250,10," It is not correct that only the Commission can determine in the first instance whether the restraints are unreasonable. That is 
why the Supreme Court remanded to the Court of Appeals here and directed the panel to consider ""whether on remand it can 
effectively assess the Commission's decision for substantial evidence on the record or whether it must remand to the 
Commission,"" 526 U.S. at 769 n.8., and why the Supreme Court has previously remanded to the Court of Appeals for initial 
applications of rule of reason. See, e.g., Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 25 n.44, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 
(1979) (""The Court of Appeals did not address the rule-of-reason issue, and BMI insists that CBS did not preserve the question 
in that court. In any event, if the issue is open in the Court of Appeals, we prefer that that court first address the matter.""). "

264,7," The Magistrate Judge noted that many of the allegations in Elsea's declaration are based only on 'information and belief "" 
rather than on personal knowledge, but did not specify what effect this had on the weighing of the allegations. We believe that 
the lower evidentiary standard applied to challenges to summary judgment under Mortensen required the Court to credit 
undisputed evidentiary contentions even when based on ""information and belief."" Moreover, the more relevant contentions in 
Elsea's declaration do appear to have been based on his personal contact with entities such as Zarnigan, DDC, and Anadol. "
265,8," The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants tried to dissuade independent rug trade publications from accepting advertising 
for CGI's trade fairs. The evidence regarding these efforts is heavily disputed in the record, however, and therefore we do not 
conclude that the lower courts' rejection of this evidence was clearly erroneous. "
267,9," The District Court held that ORIA was a ""professional organization,"" much like the Indiana Federation of Dentists, and for this

267,10," The defendants first raised this argument before the District Court in their memorandum opposing the plaintiffs' objection to the 
magistrate's initial report. However, the Magistrate Judge did not rely on this argument on remand, and the District Court did not 
rely on it in adopting the Magistrate Judge's reports. "
268,11," The Court noted that the existence of ""antitrust injury"" was one of several factors that go into a determination regarding 
antitrust standing. The other factors are: the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to cause 
that harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; . . . the directness of the injury, which addresses the concerns that 
liberal application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; . . . the existence of more direct victims of the 
alleged antitrust violations; and . . . the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. Id. at 181."
268,12," In Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, the Court articulated five factors 
that courts should consider in analyzing the existence of antitrust standing.  459 U.S. 519, 545, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 
(1983). This Court has summarized them as follows: (1) the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to 
cause harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; (2) whether the plaintiff 's alleged injury is of the type for which 
the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress; (3) the directness of the injury, which addresses the concerns that 
liberal application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; (4) the existence of more direct victims of the 
alleged antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1163 n.9 (3d Cir. 1993). "

293,3," The whole of Plaintiffs' evidence of economic damage is found in the final two paragraphs of Dertouzos' Declaration: It should be taken as given that any increases in market power due to the merger will result in higher prices and decreases 
in product quality and service for all market participants. The merger has already caused economic damage to the Laser 
Eye Center in the form of higher prices it has paid to acquire twelve Nidek excimer lasers. . . . Although I have not, at this 
stage, made an effort to quantify the extent of likely damages, historical pricing patterns and economic logic suggest they 
would be considerable. Dertouzos Decl. PP 15-16. "
294,4," As Defendants note, their Motion relies exclusively on their arguments that Plaintiffs lack ""antitrust standing"" and that they are 
barred by the doctrine of laches from equitable relief. Thus, the Court need not decide whether ATC was a ""failing"" company or 
whether the merger has increased or decreased the competitiveness of the industry. See Motion at 9 n.2 (""background 
information"")."
294,5," The Court notes that Plaintiffs have belatedly filed what is apparently intended as additional evidence of the ""injury"" that is 
being alleged by Plaintiffs. See Supplemental Declaration of Margaret Mullin Weems (""Weems Decl.""), filed September 13, 
2000. However, even the excerpted deposition testimony from Dr. Garabet included therein is lacking in any specific evidence 
that Nidek has raised its prices, or that the merger in any way changed Nidek's pricing policies. See Weems Decl. at 2-4: Q: How has your business been injured by the fact that Autonomous was not left alone as you described it? A: We feel if Autonomous was left alone, Autonomous would have been free to go out and charge lower prices, would have 
driven the prices of the lasers down in a manner that would make our business easier. Q: Is there any other way in which you contend that the Laser Eye Center has been injured . . .? A: If there is a possibility that Autonomous is indeed a state-of-the-art laser, then we feel that we've been--there's been 
barriers put between us and achieving that potential, that technology or having access to it."
294,*," * * Q: Is there any other way in which you feel the Laser Eye Center has been injured . . .? A: Yes. We feel that not only Autonomous was made more expensive, I believe even Nidek is more expensive because 
Nidek feel [sic] they can charge high prices for their lasers because we have no other place to go or the other places we 
can go to have, you know, conspired in a price fix arrangement. . . . Their suspicions and beliefs notwithstanding, it is fairly clear that Plaintiffs have not adduced any specific evidence of higher 
prices charged by Nidek, or as their cause the Summit/ATC merger. "

302,13," The Court also notes that Defendants claim there is not a single case where divestiture has been ordered by a federal court at 
the request of a private party who, ""like plaintiffs here: (i) was neither a customer nor a competitor of the merging parties; or (ii) 
had full knowledge of the merger for months before it closed, but nonetheless did not seek an injunction that would block it. Nor 
do we believe that there is a single case in which a court has ordered divestiture at the request of a private party like plaintiffs 
here when the FTC had reviewed, but did not oppose a merger."" Motion at 17. In its own research, the Court has also not found 
cases in these categories. This is not dispositive to the availability of such relief, but does stress the extraordinary nature of this 
remedy. Defendants repeatedly quote a New York District Court opinion in which the court said that ""potentially disruptive 
remedies such as divestiture of completed transactions involving integration of ongoing business activities have never been 
granted in private suits under Section 7."" Glendora v. Gannett Co., 858 F. Supp. 369, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)."
302,14, Plaintiffs did not seek this relief in the initial Complaint.
302,15," The Court has already disposed of the divestiture claim, so does not find that Plaintiffs have formally conceded that claim."
302,16," HN30[
] Compulsory licensing is a very rare remedy, and is typically only ordered in cases of patent withholding, misuse, or use of a patent to monopolize a market. See III Antitrust Law P 705c at 157-58; see also Image Technical, 125 F.3d at 1224-26 
(modifying an injunction ordering sale of patented parts so as to delete the requirement that the parts be sold at ""reasonable"" 
prices). There is no allegation of explicit patent misuse in this case, and the Court is reluctant to ascribe an antitrust violation to 
possession of a patent. See SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d 1195, 1204 (2d Cir. 1981) (""No court has ever held that the 
antitrust laws require a patent holder to forfeit the exclusionary power inherent in his patent the instant his patent monopoly 
affords him monopoly power over a relevant product market"")."
302,17," As Defendants point out, the only cases Plaintiffs cite for the availability of compulsory licensing as a remedy to antitrust 
violations involve actions brought by the U.S. government. See Besser Mfg. Co. v. United States, 343 U.S. 444, 96 L. Ed. 1063, 
72 S. Ct. 838 (1952); United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52, 35 L. Ed. 2d 104, 93 S. Ct. 861 (1973). It is not clear 
whether this remedy is available in private antitrust actions. "
303,18," The Court notes that the ongoing litigation in the District Court in Arizona does explicitly address the patents themselves. 
Because this action is not based on the Defendants' patents, the request again raises the problem of complex damage 
calculations. It would appear that the damages calculations would require at least a ""mini-trial"" on patent issues and reasonable 
royalties. "
310,1," ""Sub-run"" films refers to the exhibition of (and granting of a license to exhibit) a film after its first-run. Appropriately, ""first-run"" 
films refer to the initial exhibition in a market of a particular film. See Affidavit of D. Barry Reardon (""Reardon Aff.""). For purposes 
of the instant discussion, this court assumes that the exhibition of first-run films is more profitable than the exhibition of sub-run 
films."
310,2," A ""vertical non-price restraints of trade"" is generally defined as ""anticompetitive agreements between entities operating at 
different levels of market structure"" that do not concern the price for the underlying restrained product. See Black's Law 
Dictionary, at 1562 (Sixth Ed. 1990). See also  Orson Inc v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1368 (3d Cir. 1996) (citations 
omitted). Because clearances, by their very nature, involve contracts between businesses on different levels of the market chain 
(e.g. distributors and exhibitors), and do not involve the price of viewing the underlying films, courts have deemed such contracts 
to be ""vertical non-price restraints of trade.""  Theee Movies of Tarzana v. Pacific Theatres, Inc., 828 F.2d 1395, 1398 (9th Cir. 
1987), cert. denied,  484 U.S. 1066, 98 L. Ed. 2d 992, 108 S. Ct. 1028 (1988), citing  United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 
U.S. 131, 144-46, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948). This court sees no reason to depart from such well established 
definitions."
310,3," As framed by West Boylston in its OPPOSITION TO NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS (sic) MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MORE 
THAN 30 INTERROGATORIES, however, ""The only issue for decision in this case is whether the Clearance Agreement is 
unreasonable and therefore unlawful."" See Exhibit 26 attached to Affidavit of Jennifer Grace Miller."
310,4," The defendants also, as set forth below, separately move to strike the Affidavits of West Boylston's ""experts"" David Fedeli 
(""Fedeli"") and Martin Zides (""Zides""). Similarly, West Boylston has moved to strike the defendants' proffered ""expert'' affidavits. "
311,5," As part of the Background section, because the parties fail to proffer basic information surrounding the distribution of films in 
the Rule 56(c) record, this court looks to similar cases in which clearances are at issue. The court incorporates such basic 
propositions herein. The court finds the facts so incorporated to be reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence."
311,6," Simultaneous runs within a market are referred to as 'day-and-date' runs. Affidavit of D. Barry Reardon at p. 4 (""Reardon Aff.""). 
There are no long term or multi-picture film exhibition licensing agreements between distributors and exhibitors. Id."
311,7," These ""bids"" usually include certain proposed terms, such as ""the guaranteed minimum the theater (or exhibitor) will pay the 
distributor regardless of the movie's success, division of profits between the exhibitor and distributor, and the time period the 
movie will show.""  Theee Movies of Tarzana v. Pacific Theaters, Inc., 828 F.2d at 1397."
311,8," ""Estimating a particular theater's grossing potential is a complex judgment call, which depends on such factors as the location 
of the theater, its cleanliness, and its history and reputation as a full-time first-run theater.""  Houser v. Fox Theatres Management 
Corp., 845 F.2d 1225, 1228 (3d Cir. 1988). "
312,9," Fedeli acknowledged that his decision to build was based upon an observation of ""what [had been] going on in the business 
over the last thirty years."" More to the point, Fedeli admittedly ""made a business decision based upon past experience and [his] 
years in the industry that [West Boylston] was a viable location."" Fedeli never did or reviewed any written studies to support his 
theory of drive times, never attempted to determine the demographic area from which he would attract patrons, never contacted 
any of the motion picture distributors, including Paramount, about either obtaining first-run films or building and operating the 
West Boylston Cinema, and never hired any experts or consultants to advise him on the viability of a theater in West Boylston. 
West Boylston Cinema contends that it did consult with other experts. It points to pages 49 and 53 of David Fedeli's deposition in 
which he testifies that he conversed with Steve Minasian. There is nothing in the record, however, evidencing that Minasian was 
an ""expert"" as West Boylston Cinema contends. Accordingly, based on the totality of his deposition testimony, this court 
concludes that Fedeli, and thus West Boylston, never consulted with or hired an expert to advise it on the viability of a theater in 
West Boylston."
312,10," Fedeli acknowledged that before he built West Boylston he was ""well aware"" of several competitive challenges caused by 
National's overall presence in the marketplace. Specifically, Fedeli acknowledged that he knew National owned and operated 
three theaters within the ten-mile radius surrounding his proposed theater site in West Boylston. National's Showcase North 
eighteen screen multiplex theater was ""approximately three and a half to four miles"" away and a five minute drive from his 
proposed site, West Boylston theater and Showcase North were in the ""same marketplace,"" and Showcase North was a ""direct 
competitor"" that catered to the same patrons. According to National's own internal and ""Highly Confidential"" memorandum, 
which was based on its own ad hoc study, National acknowledged, however, that Showcase North drew only six percent to eight 
(8%) percent of its patronage from West Boylston's immediate market."
312,11," The seating capacities of the individual auditoria vary from a little over 100 in the smallest, to 210 in the largest."
312,12," The Showcase North theater originally opened in 1995 with seven screens. In 1996, National added seven more screens to 
Showcase North, and an additional four on June 19, 1998, bringing the total number of screens to eighteen. "
313,13," Two auditoria have 500 seats; two have 400 seats; two have 299 seats; three have 200 seats; five have 183 seats; and four 
have 110 seats."
313,14," West Boylston, through its ""film booker"" and proffered ""expert,"" Martin E. Zides (""Zides""), acknowledges that the Showcase 
North theater is a ""first class theater,"" is ""superior"" to West Boylston and ""has significantly greater grossing potential than West 
Boylston."" David Fedeli (""Fedeli""), the owner of West Boylston Cinema and its other proffered ""expert,"" repeated Zides' 
assessment, acknowledging that Showcase North is ""a first rate theater"" that ""provides a movie distributor an opportunity to get 
a better grossing potential."""
313,15," The defendants correctly point out that West Boylston fails to expressly define the relevant market in which the defendants are 
alleged to have restrained trade in violation of the Massachusetts Antitrust Act. For instance, Fedeli and Zides, West Boylston's 
proffered experts, identified different markets. When asked what population he looked at when determining to build a theater, 
Fedeli acknowledged that it was the ten mile radius surrounding the location where the West Boylston Cinema now is, although 
the seven mile radius was more densely populated. See Fedeli Depo. Vol. 1 at 47-48 and Vol. 3 at 160 (emphasis added). 
Fedeli later defined the geographic market, which was being restrained by the conduct of National, as the Greater Worcester 
Metropolitan area, also known as the Worcester Zone, and including a seven mile radius presumably also surrounding the 
proposed site of West Boylston. Fedeli Depo. at 159-60 (emphasis added). In contrast, Zides, the other expert offered on behalf 
of West Boylston, defines the Greater Worcester ""area"" to include ""Worcester, Shrewsbury, Westboro, Berlin, [and] Boylston."" 
Zides Depo. at 74-75. See note 2, supra. Zides acknowledged, however, that the theaters within the Greater Worcester area 
included, in addition to West Boylston and Showcase North, Hoyts Westboro Cinema, Hoyts Solomon Pond Mall Cinema and 
White City. Hoyts Westboro and Hoyts Solomon Pond Mall played day-and-date, first-run movies with Showcase North. See 
Newspaper clipping dated Friday October 16, 1999, and Friday October 22, 1999 attached to Jennifer Grace Miller Affidavit 
(""Miller Aff."") as Exhibit 36. Nonetheless, given that all facts are to be taken in a light most flattering to the non-movant, this court finds that West Boylston 
has sufficiently articulated the relevant market. Its articulation, however, as set forth below, does not shield it from its own sword."
313,16," Contrary to the defendants' assertions, West Boylston has sufficiently identified the relevant product market on which it based 
its antitrust claims against Paramount and National as ""the distribution of commercial first-run films for first-run exhibition in the 
Greater Worcester metropolitan area."" See Plaintiff's Supplemental Answers to Interrogatories # 14 and 15 attached to Miller Aff. 
at Exhibit 30. "
314,17," George Leavitt's function or relevance is not demonstrated by the summary judgment record. His position, however, is 
immaterial."
314,18," Fedeli, Zides, and hence, West Boylston, knew that clearances were a common practice in the motion picture industry when 
West Boylston was built."
314,19," It is undisputed that Cooper also contacted film distributors other than Paramount to request clearance over West Boylston. 
Because the case at bar concerns only Paramount, however, this court considers only Paramount's grant of clearance vis-a-vis 
National and West Boylston."
314,20," It is unclear what impact, if any, Paramount's grant of clearance to National had on West Boylston's ability to continue 
exhibiting sub-run movies."
314,21," Paramount has not conducted any studies to determine whether a day-and-date or first-run exhibition with West Boylston and 
Showcase North would maximize its revenues or enhance the market. See Molen Depo. at 53 and 106. Similarly, however, 
neither has West Boylston. See Zides Depo. at 81-92. "
315,22," Fedeli stated in his Affidavit in opposition to the instant motions that, ""On October 29, 1998, Paramount testified through its 
Branch Manager Thomas Molen that I would be permitted to bid for upcoming ""Star Trek"" film if I chose to do so. Less than a 
month later . . ."" Based on that statement, this court inferred that he submitted a bid in November 1998."
315,23," HN2[
] Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e) provides in relevant part that, Supporting affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and 
shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. "
316,24," The court notes one ""affirmation"" in particular. In paragraph four (4) of his Affidavit, Fedeli states that ""Paramount makes more 
money in Fitchburg by permitting Cinema World and Loews to play day-and-date than it did with Loews alone before I opened 
[Cinema World] in 1995."" Not only does Fedeli fail to explain the association between Lowes/Cinema World and West 
Boylston/National, but he also lacks, as he readily admitted during his deposition, personal knowledge of ""any film distributors' 
film rentals receipts in a situation where that distributor is playing his films day-and-date or exhibitors are playing his films day-
and-date."" See Deposition of David Fedeli Vol. 4 at p. 108 attached to Miller Aff. at Exhibit 1(C). At a bare minimum, paragraph 
four (4) must be disregarded. See  Johnson v. Cohan, 2000 Mass. Super. LEXIS 45,  Civil Action No. 96-7352, 2000 WL 282594 
at *10 (Mass.Super.Ct. Jan. 14, 2000) (finding ""for purposes of summary judgment, affiant bound by her deposition testimony 
and cannot create a dispute of material fact by contradicting it"")  [11 Mass. L. Rptr. 425]. See also  Morrell v. Precise Eng'g, Inc., 
36 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 937, 630 N.E.2d 291 (1994) (""Plaintiff's affidavit is not some sort of wand that can wave away the 
damage to his claim contained in testimony previously given at the deposition hearing""). Moreover, paragraph 9 refers to Fedeli's 
""beliefs,"" and paragraph 10 not only refers to his ""beliefs"" but also recites what Fedeli contends National ""knows."" Such 
asseverations are inadequate to serve as competent evidence. See  TLT Const. Corp. v. A. Anthony Tappe and Associates, 
Inc., 48 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 11, 716 N.E.2d 1044 (1999). "
317,25," The court also notes the general reluctance to disqualify proffered expert witnesses at the summary judgment stage of 
proceedings. See  Cortes-Irizarry v. Corporacion Insular De Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 187-88 (1st Cir. 1997) (defendants did not 
move to strike plaintiffs' expert affidavits; finding that, although the Daubert regime can play a role in the summary judgment 
phase of civil litigation, ""courts must be cautious--except when defects are obvious on the face of a proffer--not to exclude 
debatable scientific evidence without affording the proponent of the evidence adequate opportunity to defend its admissibility);  
Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat. Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 58 (1st Cir. 1996) (""At summary judgment . . . courts normally 
assume that the trier of fact would credit the expert testimony proffered by the nonmovant"");  Noble v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber 
Co., 34 Mass. App. Ct. 397, 402, 612 N.E.2d 250 (1993) (finding plaintiff need not show a perfect case in opposition to summary 
judgment)."
317,26," HN7[
] Fed.R.Evid. 702 provides in relevant part that ""If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, 
experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise."" The Federal rule is the same as 
rule 702 of the Massachusetts Proposed Rules of Evidence.   Higgins v. Delta Elevator Service Corp., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 
646 n.5, 700 N.E.2d 833 (1998), citing  Commonwealth v. Lanigan, 419 Mass. at 15, 25 (1994). Pursuant to Rule 702, a trial 
judge must ensure that any and all scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge testimony or evidence which is admitted 
is not only relevant, but also reliable. See  Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238, 119 S. Ct. 1167 "
318,," (1999). This court appropriately looks to the construction of its federal counterpart for guidance. See  Lanigan, supra (rules of 
evidence). See also  Doe v. Senechal, 431 Mass. 78, 81 n.8, 725 N.E.2d 225 (2000) (considering rules of civil procedure)."
318,27," This court notes that, even though Fedeli and Zides may be ""generally familiar"" with the Massachusetts Blind Bidding Act, their 
assumed familiarity without more is insufficient to demonstrate the type of ""specialized"" knowledge or intellectual rigor that 
characterizes the practice of an expert in that area of the law."
318,28," The absence of any factual basis supporting Zides' opinion is revealed in the following exchange during his deposition: Q: Is there any limitation to the number of theaters in a marketplace that should pay a movie day-and-date before it no longer 
enhances the market? A: No. Q: There's no limitation? A: I don't believe so. Q: So is it your opinion that every time you add a theater in the marketplace to play the same movie, it will enhance the market? A: Yes. Q: And on what do you base that opinion? A: It's a big world. Mr. Remis: Well we're not talking about the world. Fedeli: There are a lot of patrons out there. A lot of patrons might choose not to go--people who live close to a theater might just 
be happy going to their own neighborhood theater and maybe they just don't go to Worcester North, or they don't go to Berlin, or 
maybe they do. Q: Do you have any studies that indicate where people go? A: No. Q: So this is just speculation on your part? A: Absolutely. The whole thing was my opinion. Zides Dep. Vol. 1 at p. 101-02. The absence of any factual basis supporting Fedeli's opinion is demonstrated by the following deposition interchange: Q: Have you been privy, have you seen in the last two years the amount of any film distributors' film rentals receipts in a situation 
where that distributor is playing his films day-and-date or exhibitors are playing his films day-and-date? A: I have not seen anything because I am not privy to that information. Q: So this statement that they would actually enhance the film rental payments to the distributors is based upon your assumption 
that the grosses would be increased. Right? A: No. Based upon my knowledge. Q: Based on your belief that the grosses would be increased. Right? A: Yes. Fedeli Depo.Vol. 4 at p. 108. "
319,, This court is disinclined to accept such self-serving speculation as competent evidence. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e).

319,30," Specifically, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, so much of paragraph 6 that relates to Paramount, and paragraph 7. "
320,31," HN9[
] Rule 56(f) provides that parties objecting to the timing of summary judgment file an affidavit explaining that, ""for reasons stated [they could not] present by affidavit facts essential to justify [their] opposition"" to a summary judgment motion and 
request a continuance to complete discovery.   Tetrault v. Mahoney, Hawkes & Goldings, 425 Mass. 456, 458-59, 681 N.E.2d

321,32," Because West Boylston does not contend that the defendants' experts are not qualified, this court declines to examine, in 
detail, their credentials under Laninan, Daubert or, now, Kumho and Theresa Canavan's Case."
321,33," This court notes that, in antitrust cases, ""care must be taken to ensure that inferences of unlawful activity drawn from 
ambiguous evidence do not infringe upon the defendants' freedom.""  Petruzzi's IGA v. Darling-Delaware Co., Inc., 998 F.2d 
1224, 1230 (3d Cir. 1993). "
322,34," This court's analysis under ยงยง 4 and 5 of the Massachusetts Antitrust Act is the same as that under the cognate federal act. 
G.L.c. 93, ยง 1.   Quaker State Corp. v. Leavitt, 839 F. Supp. at 79 n.1, citing  Winter Hill, 691 F. Supp. at 543 n.5. "
323,35," National's and Paramount's ""unity of purpose"" is illustrated by the following. As an exhibitor of motion pictures, National sought 
to maximize its profits on the exhibition of films in its Showcase North theater via clearances on first-run films. In so doing, 
National attempted (and in fact) secured Showcase North's gross box office profits that, in turn, led to a higher return on 
Paramount's investment, which necessarily produced higher profits for Viacom, its parent. Completing the circle and unifying the "
324,," underlying symbiotic relationship, as Viacom's profits grew, so too did its value to its controlling shareholder, and owner, 
National."
324,36," This court observes, however, that, but for West Boylston's inability to show diversity of entities in proving a conspiracy under 
this court's view of Copperweld, the summary judgment record otherwise raises an inference that Paramount engaged in 
antitrust conduct. See  The Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists Communications, 909 F.2d 1245, 1250-52 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied 
sub nom,  Paramount Pictures Corp. v. The Movie 1 & 2, 501 U.S. 1230, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1020, 111 S. Ct. 2852 (1991) (reversing 
summary judgment in favor of distributor, and finding no business justification for failing to accept higher bid of plaintiff and thus 
inference of antitrust conduct sufficient to create question of fact). See infra for discussion of Paramount's invitation to bid."
324,37," Because of the complexity of vertical non-price restraints and the likelihood that such vertical arrangements often enhance 
competition, judicial precedent instructs this court to weigh the anti-competitive effects of clearances against any legitimate 
business justifications for them under the rule of reason.   American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. IMR Capital Corp., 888 F. Supp. 221, 252 
(D.Mass. 1995). The true test of legality under the rule of reason is: Whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as 
may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the 
business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and 
its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, 
the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. Orson, Inc., 79 F.3d at 1367, citing  Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 
(1918)."
324,38," The court pauses here briefly to note that whether or not National maintained ""market power"" that restrained competition will 
be discussed infra. See  American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. IMR Capital Corp., 888 F. Supp. 221, 252 (D.Mass. 1995) (noting that ""as a 
preliminary matter, the plaintiff . . . must first demonstrate that the defendant is capable of causing antitrust harm by showing that 
it (the defendant) can exercise 'market power' in the relevant market""). See also  Quaker State Corp., 839 F. Supp. at 80; Orion, "
325,," Inc., 79 F.3d at 1367 (""In rule of reason cases, the plaintiff bears the initial burden by showing that the alleged combination or 
agreement produced adverse, anti-competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets""). "
326,39," ""Intrabrand competition is the competition between theaters simultaneously exhibiting the same film."" See  Soffer v. National 
Amusements, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19751, *19,  1996 WL 194947 at *5 n.10 (D.Conn. 1996)."

] G.L.c. 93, ยง 5 makes it unlawful for ""any person or persons to monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in the Commonwealth."" Broadly read, 
West Boylston's complaint alleges that Paramount clearances granted to National constitute (1) monopolization, (2) attempts to 
monopolize and (3) a conspiracy to monopolize first-run distribution and exhibition of motion pictures. HN20[
] Despite the 
differing elements between a claim based upon monopolization and one based on attempted monopolization, there are 
significant overlaps in proof. To prove either violation under G.L.c. 93, ยง 5, West Boylston must ""demonstrate that the defendant 
engaged in anti-competitive conduct.""  Soffer v. National Amusements, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19751, *23,  1996 WL 
194947 at *6. See  Town of Concord, MA v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1990), citing  United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). See also  Syufy Enterprises v. American Multicinema, 
Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 993-99 (9th Cir. 1986). For the reasons set forth infra West Boylston has failed so to demonstrate. As a 
threshold matter, this court finds, as established supra, that the defendants could not conspire with one another. Accordingly, the 
court addresses only whether the defendants monopolized or attempted to monopolize the first-run distribution and exhibition of 
motion pictures in the greater Worcester metropolitan area. "
327,42," This court assumes that there is not ""cross-elasticity of demand"" between the exhibition of sub-run films and first- run films. 
Stated differently, sub-run films and first-run films are not reasonably interchangeable. See  Syufy Enterprises v. American 
Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 994 (9th Cir. 1986). "

trade screened within the commonwealth before any such event has occurred."

339,2," Somehow the Supreme Court's language in Celotex leads one to envision the initial ""pointing out"" an absence of evidence as a 
single page or other short submission. I note with some wonderment that the initial ""pointing out"" papers on this motion filled at 
least two boxes."

343,4," The evaluation of the market should focus on manufacturer and consumer recognition of the relevant competition (here, the 
fountain syrup manufacturers), not on delivery provider recognition of the competition. PepsiCo, however, looks to what it 
characterizes as distributors' recognition. (See, e.g., Pl.'s 56.1 Counterstmt. P 53 (""The executives of the leading systems firms 
have testified that their competition is other systems distributors."").) The fact that independent foodservice distributors view their 
primary competition as one another, and not bottlers, is not pertinent to industry recognition of the relevant market within the 
meaning of Brown Shoe. "
345,5," Indeed, PepsiCo specifies the distributors at issue in the litigation as ""independent."" (Am. Compl. P 1.)"
345,6," JBL Enters., Inc. v. Jhirmack Enters., Inc., 698 F.2d 1011 (9th Cir. 1983), provides further support. In Jhirmack, the distributors 
of hair care products in the professional salon market brought an antitrust action against the product manufacturer and its 
exclusive over-the counter market distributor. The Jhirmack court set forth HN12[
] a two-step process for market definition. 
""First the field in which the plaintiff was engaged must be defined in geographic and distributional terms. Then the product (or 
product line) that competes in that field must be determined."" 698 F.2d at 1016. The court of appeals upheld the district court's 
definition of the relevant distributional market. It determined that the plaintiff operated as a wholesaler, engaging in the 
distribution of Jhirmack products to specific retailers. Id. at 1016. As such, the plaintiff competed with other wholesalers for 
specific customers. Id. Here, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola operate as manufacturers, engaging in the production of fountain syrup 
which each company sends to certain distributors and bottlers. The distribution to consumers of fountain syrup is separate from 
the product line in the field in which PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are engaged. "
347,7," This absence of pricing information follows approximately eighteen months of multi-track aggressive discovery which both sides 
agreed was justified because this is the ""Cola Wars."" "
348,8," PepsiCo's citation to cases that involve price-fixing are inapplicable to the facts of this action. Price-fixing is illegal per se even 
where the arrangement is purely vertical. See Monsanto v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 762-64, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 
1470, 1472, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). "

360,3, There are several other hospitals in New Jersey in the corridor between Atlantic City and Philadelphia.
360,4," Plaintiff suggests that the submarket for trauma services is more geographically restricted because of the emergent nature of 
the injuries. Yet, a trauma patient midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City might just as likely go to Philadelphia or 
Camden as she would go to ACMC's trauma facility. Even if Plaintiff is correct that the submarket for trauma is more restricted, 
he nevertheless fails to establish that Defendants' actions had any anticompetitive effect on that market. Plaintiff was replaced 
on the trauma staff after he relinquished his privileges, so output has not been restricted. Nor has there been any showing that 
prices have risen. "
363,5," It is worth noting that Plaintiff does not allege a claim under N.J.S.A. 56:9-3, the New Jersey analogue to Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. "
373,1," As to one defendant, there are other issues, but they in no way affect this opinion. "
374,2," Although the stipulated facts state that the ""approval"" of the City Council was required, the remainder of the stipulation and 
record make it clear that the Council had the authority to reject the Zoning Adjustment Board's decision to issue a permit but was 
not required to grant affirmative approval."
374,3," This letter stated in part: A small well-funded group of neighborhood homeowners, in concert with a political organization, has effectively blocked the 
project to date. They have been particularly successful in building opposition through scare tactics, as is evidenced in their 
literature. One of their principal arguments against this project is that it will benefit people that are diagnosed as mentally 
disabled or disabled through substance abuse. . . . Although we have encountered resistance on other affordable housing 
projects, it has never been so strong, nor so clearly discriminatory. Also, we are disturbed by the fact that these neighbors 
are backed by a political organization (the Council of Neighborhood Associations, or CNA)."
374,4," The flyers made a variety of points about the project. One, titled ""Who are the Homeless?"", showed a pie chart dividing the 
homeless into three, presumably discrete categories - economic, mentally ill, and substance abusers - and complained about the 
""inequitable distribution"" of Berkeley housing and services for the homeless in poor areas or commercial corridors ""with high "
375,," ethnic concentrations."" Another listed projects planned for the area near the intersection of University and Shattuck Avenues, 
stated that these projects would provide beds for ""90 mentally ill and 90 'stabilized' substance abusers,"" and concluded, ""This is 
commercial suicide! Impacts MUST be assessed!"" A third flyer contended that inadequate information had been provided about 
the Bel Air project for the Berkeley City Council to make a ""fair, complete and proper evaluation""; regarding the project's tenant 
population, it stated, ""At least 71% will be homeless, but no details as to mentally ill, substance abusers, dual diagnosis, etc."""
375,5," With respect to possible penalties, each letter specified: ""In an administrative law proceeding, if the judgement is for the 
complainant, remedies include injunctive relief, actual damages, and civil penalties up to $ 10,000 for a first offense, or $ 50,000 
for multiple offenses. If the matter is referred to a U.S. District Court, remedies include injunctive relief, actual and punitive 
damages, and civil penalties up to $ 50,000 for a first offense, or $ 100,000 for multiple offenses. Under Section 813, the 
complainant also retains the right to bring an individual lawsuit under the Federal Fair Housing Law. . . ."" "
376,6," Counsel for the HUD officials contend that this assertion by Bryden is ""disputed"" and therefore cannot support the district 
judgment's grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the issue of liability. At oral argument, however, counsel admitted that 
the record does not contain any evidence disputing this assertion. "
378,7," It is clear that in granting the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment against defendants Lee, Smith, Zurowski, and 
Gillespie on the issue of liability, the district court held that as a matter of law these defendants were not entitled to qualified 
immunity. Therefore, as to these defendants, we disregard as inconsistent with the court's clear holding its statement that the 
qualified immunity inquiry, ""one of reasonableness, . . . remains a question of fact for the trier of fact."" As to Phillips, factual 
issues may remain for trial. "

indirect 'discouragements' undoubtedly have the same coercive effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights as 
imprisonment, fines, injunctions, or taxes.""). "
381,9," In NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, the Supreme Court observed that the ""compelled disclosure"" of a controversial group's 
membership is ""likely to affect adversely the ability of [the group] and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs 
which they admittedly have the right to advocate."" 357 U.S. at 462-63."
381,10," As to Phillips, there may be a factual issue as to whether he made the statement at issue. For purposes of considering the 
denial of his motion for summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense, we must assume the facts as asserted by the 
plaintiffs."
381,11," The FHA's prohibitions were expanded to include discrimination based on familial status and handicap in the Fair Housing 
Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), Pub. L. No. 100-430, 102 Stat. 1619 (1988). A person is considered handicapped under the 
FHA if he has a physical or mental impairment (including ""mental retardation, emotional illness, drug addiction (other than 
addiction caused by current, illegal use of a controlled substance) and alcoholism"") that substantially limits one or more major life 
activities.  24 C.F.R. ยง 100.201. The FHAA also made violations of ยง 3617 ""discriminatory housing practices"" under ยง 3602(f),

383,14," We do not mean to imply that the converse is true. Whether or not Noerr-Pennington provides greater protection than the First 
Amendment is a question we need not consider in this case. "
384,15," Nor do we decide whether lawsuits that challenge government conduct may ever be treated as ""sham,"" even if objectively 
baseless. See Note, A Petition Clause Analysis of Suits Against the Government: Implications for Rule 11 Sanctions, 106 Harv.

384,17," Even though HRI's complaint was actually drafted by a HUD intake analyst, administrative complaints are normally interpreted 
generously to the complainant in statutory schemes ""in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process."" Zipes 
v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 397, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234, 102 S. Ct. 1127 (1982) (quoting Love v. Pullman Co., 404 
U.S. 522, 527, 30 L. Ed. 2d 679, 92 S. Ct. 616 (1972)). "
386,18," Particularly notable is the fact that in Professional Real Estate Investors, the Court cited the holding in Bill Johnson's that ""by 
analogy to Noerr's sham exception, . . . even an 'improperly motivated' lawsuit may not be enjoined under the National Labor 
Relations Act as an unfair labor practice unless such litigation is 'baseless.'"" 508 U.S. at 59. However, rather than applying or 
even citing the subsequent Bill Johnson's statements regarding unsuccessful lawsuits, the Court emphasized that a litigant's 
failure to prevail did not establish the objective baselessness of his suit, and it proceeded to apply Noerr-Pennington immunity to 
an action that had in fact been defeated on summary judgment. Had the Court believed that the statements in Bill Johnson's had 
any effect, we would expect that it would have explained why it did not apply them in the case before it. The fact that the Court 
did not do so indicates that it considered the statements dicta. "
387,19," The officials' investigation started in November 1993 and the state court did not enter judgment against the plaintiffs' coalition 
until February 3, 1994. Most of the investigation, however, occurred after that date."
387,20," We note, incidentally, that in the few published decisions in which lawsuits were claimed to constitute discriminatory housing 
practices, district courts have generally applied the Noerr-Pennington ""objectively baseless"" standard in evaluating First 
Amendment defenses. See, e.g., United States v. Wagner, 940 F. Supp. 972, 981-82 (N.D. Tex. 1996) (holding that suit to 
enforce restrictive covenant against group home for mentally retarded children ""had no reasonable basis in law or fact,"" had 
been filed with discriminatory aims, and therefore violated FHA); United States v. Robinson, 3 Fair Hous.-Fair Lend. (P-H) Par. 
15,979, at 15979.9 to 15979.12 (D. Conn. Jan. 26, 1995) (holding that neighbors' zoning action challenging proposed use of 
home for handicapped children was not baseless as matter of state law and was therefore protected by First Amendment)."
387,21," In Gissel Packing the employer had conveyed, through speeches, leaflets, and letters, the message that it was in a precarious 
financial condition, that a strike would probably result in a plant shutdown, and that in such case the employees would have 
difficulty finding employment elsewhere.  395 U.S. at 619. The Court affirmed the NLRB's finding that these communications 
constituted a threat of retaliatory action unprotected by the First Amendment. Id. at 619-20. "
389,22," HN28[
] Qualified immunity, we note, involves a purely objective inquiry. See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 588, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759, 118 S. Ct. 1584 (1998); Harlow, 457 U.S. at 817-19. We therefore decline to consider either the plaintiffs' 
contention that the HUD officials ""actually knew"" that they were violating the First Amendment but were ""testing"" to see how far 
they could proceed against neighborhood protest groups under the FHA, or the officials' protestations they are ""dedicated"" public 
servants who acted ""in good faith."""
389,23," As to Phillips, our conclusion is based on the assumption that any disputed material facts are resolved in the plaintiffs' favor. 
See note 10, supra. "
391,24," For the foregoing reasons, we also affirm the district court's denial of defendant Lee's motion for summary judgment on 
liability. "
393,25," The HUD officials have submitted notices showing that the agency has extended the effective date of the Achtenberg 
memorandum five times since its implementation, most recently to April 30, 2001."
393,26," The declarations and newspaper articles that the plaintiffs presented in the district court in response to the defendants' motion 
to dismiss do not show that HUD has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Achtenberg memorandum's terms, and no 
contention is made that HUD has done so since that time."
393,27," On August 8, 1996, when the district court granted the officials' motion to dismiss the claim for prospective relief, the 
Achtenberg memorandum had been in effect for sixteen months. Whether or not the claim for prospective relief was moot as of 
that time, it is clearly moot now. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 66, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170, 117 S. Ct. 
1055 (1997) (observing that ""HN37[
] to qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, 'an actual controversy must be 
extant at all stages of review,'"" and holding that plaintiff's resignation from state job during appeal rendered her claim for 
prospective relief moot) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401, 45 L. Ed. 2d 272, 95 S. Ct. 2330 (1975)). "
400,1," This Motion for Summary Judgment is addressed to plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman Act claim. On May 19, 2000, defendants filed a 
separate Motion for Summary Judgment as to plaintiffs' tortious interference and Unfair Trade Practices Act claims. Defendants' 
second motion will be addressed in a separate Memorandum Opinion."
400,2," The defendants will be collectively referred to as ""defendants."" "
402,3," Judge Propst further concluded that without the Robinson-Patman claim, plaintiffs' claims for tortious interference and violation 
of the Alabama Unfair Practices Act failed. (Id. at 64-65.) By consent of the parties, Judge Propst then dismissed plaintiffs' sole 
remaining claim, brought under the Alabama Motor Fuel Marketing Act, as well as defendants' counterclaims. (Id. at 73-84.) "
403,4," Plaintiffs apparently agree with this assessment. (See Pls.' Br. at 6) (""It is important to understand what has transpired on 
appeal and why Judge Propst was reversed. In the first place, he never went through an appropriate Rule 702 analysis as 
required by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993).""). "
404,5," The other type of violation under the Act, not at issue here, is called ""secondary-line"" price discrimination; that kind of claim 
involves, for example, a manufacturer selling the same product to different customers at different prices. Best Beverages, Inc., 
842 F.2d at 584 n.1. In that instance, the disfavored customer claims injury. Id."
404,6," The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that HN6[
] Robinson-Patman claims should be viewed with skepticism. ""Predatory 
pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 
574, 589, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). ""The costs of an erroneous finding of liability are high."" Brooke Group, 509 
U.S. at 226. ""The mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing -- lowering prices -- is the same mechanism by which "
405,," a firm stimulates competition; because cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition . . .[;] 
mistaken inferences . . . are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct that antitrust laws are designed to protect."" 
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 122 n. 17, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986) (quoting Matsushita, 
475 U.S. at 594)."
405,7," Market power is also sometimes referred to as ""monopoly power."" See U.S. Anchor, 7 F.3d at 994 n. 12."
405,8," As noted, infra at n.7, monopoly power and market power are synonymous. "
406,9," Plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman primary-line price discrimination claim is analyzed the same way as a monopolization claim under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Brooke Group 509 U.S. at 222 (1993)."
406,10," Indeed, in the Rule 104 hearing on the admissibility of Gunther's opinions, plaintiffs admitted to Judge Propst that they must 
prove the relevant geographic market: COURT: . . . But, in any event, I don't think that there's any question, is there, that part of the essential proof of any case is 
to prove both the geographic market and market power and product; is that correct? STABLER: I'm going to agree with you. That's what the cases have said. (Vol. II Transcript of Rule 104 Hearing at 16.) "
407,11," In other words, HN13[
] a district court must assess ""whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is 
scientifically valid and [] whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue."" Id. at 592-93. The 
Court added, however, that ""many factors will bear on the inquiry, and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or 
test."" Id."
407,12," The Supreme Court expects district courts to perform this special ""gatekeeping"" role even when the task is difficult. ""Neither 
the difficulty of the task nor any comparative lack of expertise can excuse the judge from exercising the 'gatekeeper' duties that 
the Federal Rules impose . . . ."" Id. at 148. ""These stricter standards are necessary because of the potential impact on the jury of 
expert testimony."" Allison v. McGhan Medical Corp., 184 F.3d 1300, 1310 (11th Cir. 1999). "
408,13," In City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chem., Inc., 158 F.3d 548, 562 (11th Cir. 1998), the Eleventh Circuit stated that HN16[
] 
scientific (and now non-scientific) expert testimony is admissible when: (i) the expert is qualified to testify competently regarding the matters he intends to address; (ii) the methodology by which the expert reaches his conclusion is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry 
mandated by Daubert, and, (iii) the testimony assists the trier of fact, through the application of scientific, technical, or specialized expertise, to 
understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. "
409,14," Judge Propst reached the same conclusion: ""Dr. Gunther's selection of a 20-mile radius around Susan Moore, Alabama, as 
the purported geographic market appears to be based only on the statement of plaintiff P.D. Bailey that his drivers typically 
drove 20 miles from Susan Moore, which was where plaintiffs were headquartered."" (emphasis added). (Judge Propst's March 
25, 1998, Rule 54(b) Order of Dismissal at 2.)"
409,15," In responding to a question regarding the location of other competitors, Gunther testified: ""I received a fax from Mr. Stabler last 
week which had locations on it but . . . it did not come out, so the answer is yes, but I could not read it through the fax."" (Gunther 
Dep. at 46.) The court agrees with Judge Propst's conclusion that ""perhaps, the most glaring deficiency in the report-deposition 
is Gunther's total failure to consider the location of other competitors."" (Mem. Op. at 28) (emphasis in original.)."
409,16," In responding to a question regarding any price analyses Gunther had performed, he stated: ""There was only one document in 
the material that I had. I believe it was one of the competitors on one date had done, I guess, a telephone survey and had written 
down prices of the other competitors. I don't know who it was . . . But it was one particular date in that whole time period so that's 
the only information that I have on the prices in the other markets of other competitors."" (Gunther Dep. at 124.) "
410,17," Gunther testified: ""The first time I don't believe I got the name of the person and that was in Lyle, Illinois . . . which is where the association is 
located. They were apparently having a trade show somewhere and everybody was out. So -- then I talked with the Southeast 
Director of Fuel services for the Southeastern states and I have her name. . . . And then the other call was today . . . Well, the 
lady that answered the phone and I did not get her name . . . . And I don't know what her title was."" (Gunther Dep. at 27-28, 30-
31.)"
410,18," In fact, Gunther had no idea where the competitors were located. (Gunther Dep. at 45-47, 50-51.) "
411,19," Gunther testified as follows: Q: Now the next sentence says, ""Indeed, based upon AllGas records, the transportation distances from a retailer tank site 
to customers tends to be in the range of 10 miles one way or 20 miles around [sic] trip."" . . . Q: Okay. And based on your calculations, it showed that the Allgas drivers' average daily trip was 10 miles? A: Well, it was monthly information, so it would be an average over the month. . . . Q: Okay. Let me ask you, would a fairer statement of that be that it[s] customers that are more than 10 miles away from the 
tank site as opposed to 20 miles from the tank site? A: Probably, yes. The way it's phrased there, yeah. (Gunther Dep. at 34-36.)"
411,20," Assuming that Gunther's purported relevant geographic market was a 20-mile radius around Susan Moore (which is what 
plaintiffs have consistently argued), the court again notes that Gunther improperly based that market definition solely on the fact 
that, as he understood it, plaintiffs did not sell propane gas outside the 20-mile radius around Susan Moore. In other words, 
Gunther's sole justification for his purported geographic market was that it mirrored plaintiffs' purported service area. "
413,21," As Gunther conceded in his deposition testimony, (Gunther Dep. at 110-13), the propane industry is different from many other 
industries in that very few assets are required. See also United States v. EmpireGas Corp., 537 F.2d 296, 305 (8th Cir. 1976) 
(""All that are needed [to compete in the propane gas industry] are a supply of LP, a truck, and perhaps a storage tank."") "
414,22," An oligopoly is an ""economic condition where only a few companies sell substantially similar or standardized products."" 
BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1086 (6th ed. 1990). An oligopoly market ""often exhibit[s] [a] lack of competition, high prices and 
low output of monopoly markets."" Id. "
417,23," Gunther testified: Q: But, in your mind, to determine whether the market is competitive, you are not so much looking at the market share? A: That's right. Q: You are really looking at the return on the -- For example, you are in here to discuss the rate of return on assets, right? A: Right. . . . Q: Now, would it be true that if one of the companies in a particular market has a higher rate of return than the others, but 
all of them are higher than normal . . . would that one tend to have greater market power than the others, in your mind? A: Yes. By the -- by the definition, the difference between price and marginal costs, if they're earning more, they have more 
market power. Q: Okay. Well, if you are going to make that kind of analysis in a market, wouldn't you have to know what the rate of return 
is for the other competitors in the market? A: No. (Gunther Dep. at 72-73, 75.)"
417,24," Gunther does not know the rate of return for the Allgas Altoona office. (Gunther Dep. at 86-88.) Thus, Gunther does not know 
the one fact that might be relevant under his flawed methodology. "

Paper, Inc. v. Stone Container Corp., Civil Action No. 98-5228 (filed Oct. 1, 1998, E.D. Pa.), and Local Baking Products, Inc. v. 
Stone Container Corp., Civil Action No. 98-5384 (filed Oct. 9, 1998, E.D. Pa.). On December 18, 1998 the four actions were 
consolidated by this Court by stipulation and order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a). A First Amended and 
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""Corrugated Box Amended Complaint"") was filed on May 14, 1999. Stone Container Corp. 
and twelve other corporations were named as defendants in the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint. It is this complaint that 
Stone Container Corp. presently seeks to dismiss."
464,2," The Corrugated Sheets Complaints have been grouped into two categories -- Sheets Complaint I and Sheets Complaint II. 
""Sheets Complaint I"" refers collectively to three class action complaints, identical in all material respects, originally filed in 1998 
in the Northern District of Illinois against Stone Container Corp. on behalf of purchasers of corrugated sheets: General 
Refractories Co. v. Stone Container Corp., Civil Action No. 99-1341 (transferred on Mar. 16, 1999 to E.D. Pa.), and originally No. 
98 C 3543 (filed June 8, 1998, N.D. Ill.); Albert O Halper Corrugated Box Co. v. Stone Container Corp., Class Action No. 99-
1396 (transferred on Mar. 19, 1999 to E.D. Pa.), and originally No. 98 C 4659 (filed July 28, 1998, N.D. Ill.); and Crest Meat Co., 
Inc. v. Stone Container Corp., Civil Action No. 99-1397 (transferred on Mar. 19, 1998 to E.D. Pa.), and originally No. 98 C 4612 
(filed July 27, 1998, N.D. Ill.). Stone Container Corp. filed a motion to dismiss the three complaints in the Northern District of 
Illinois and on January 8, 1999 Judge Blanche M. Manning denied that motion. Subsequently, on February 5. 1999. Stone 
Container Corp. filed a consolidated answer to the three complaints included in Sheets Complaint I. Presently before the Court is 
the motion of Stone Container Corp. for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Sheets Compliant I."
464,3," The Non-Stone Defendants refer to this complaint as the ""Winoff Complaint"" because Winoff Industries, Inc. is the lead plaintiff 
named in the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint filed on behalf of purchasers of corrugated boxes."
464,4," ""Sheets Complaint II"" refers to a separate class action complaint on behalf of purchasers of corrugated sheets filed on May 18, 
1999 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against eleven ""Non-Stone Defendants."" These Non-Stone Defendants filed a 
motion to dismiss Sheets Complaint II which is presently before the Court. Stone Container Corp. joins in that motion on the 
theory that if the Non-Stone Defendants' motion is granted, it cannot be found liable for an antitrust conspiracy as a matter of law 
because all of the alleged co-conspirators will have been dismissed. The Non-Stone Defendants refer to Sheets Complaint II as 
the ""General Refractories Complaint"" because General Refractories, Inc. is the lead plaintiff named on behalf of the corrugated 
sheets plaintiffs."
464,5," This motion was filed under Federal Rile of Civil Procedure 12(e) by the Non-Stone Defendants. They seek a more definite 
statement with respect to the conspiracy alleged in the complaints against them - the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint and 
Sheets Complaint II. "
465,6," Linerboard includes any grade of paperboard suitable for use in the production of corrugated sheets, which are in turn used in 
the manufacture of corrugated boxes and for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Corrugated sheets are made by 
gluing a fluted sheet which is not made of linerboard, known as the corrugating medium, between facing sheets of linerboard. 
The defendants named in the instant lawsuits are the major integrated manufacturers and sellers of both linerboard and 
corrugated sheets. "
466,7," Tenneco, Inc. is the sole Non-Stone Defendant that was not made a party to the action brought by the Corrugated Sheets 
plaintiffs."
466,8," One of the defendants named in both the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint and Sheets Complaint II, Simpson Tacoma 
Kraft Co., was dismissed by agreement of all plaintiffs on November 8, 1999. See Stipulation of Dismissal in MDL No. 1261 
(Doc. 43, filed Nov. 8, 1999). Thus, eleven Non-Stone defendants remain as parties to the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint, 
and ten Non-Stone defendants remain as parties to Sheets Complaint II. "
467,9," One of the Non-Stone Defendants -- Packaging Corporation of America -- claims that it was never served with Sheets 
Complaint II. Therefore, it only joins in the Joint Motion to Dismiss as it applies to the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint. "
468,10," The three complaints referred to as Sheets Complaint I allege a ""class period"" from October 1, 1993 through March 31, 1995. 
See Sheets Complaint I (all three complaints), at P 1. Sheets Complaint II and the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint allege a 
class period from October 1, 1993 through November 30, 1995. See Sheets Complaint II, at P 1; Corrugated Box Amended 
Complaint, at P 5(b). "
469,11," The Court's conclusion regarding whether the complaints adequately plead a continuing antitrust violation is dispositive on the 
statute of limitations issue. Accordingly, the Court need not consider the remaining statute of limitations arguments raised by the 
parties -- that is, tolling pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 16(i) and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. "
470,12," The other competitors are currently named as defendants in the cases before this Court, but were not in the cases that 
originally before Judge Manning, that is the three complaints collectively referred to as Sheets Complaint I. "
481,1," The ""NBTY plaintiffs"" filed a joinder to this Motion. Accordingly, this Opinion also relates to the actions of NBYT, Inc, et al. v. F. 
Hoffman-LaRoche, Ltd., et al., Perrigo Co, et al. v. F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Ltd., et al., Natural Alternatives Internatl., et al. v. F. "
482,," Hoffman-LaRoche, Ltd., et al., and Leiner Health Products, Inc., et al. v. F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Ltd., et al. (hereafter, ""NBTY, et 
al."")."
482,2," The Court was later informed that defendants DCV, Inc. and DuCoa L.P. had incorporated Degussa's arguments regarding 
indirect purchaser claims under the Donnelly Act into their motions to dismiss. To the extent that DCV, Inc. and DuCoa L.P. and 
any other defendants had adopted these arguments, this Opinion would include their motions as well. "
483,3," It is worth noting that BMS was a party to the Levine case and successfully argued against indirect purchaser liability under the 
Donnelly Act in that action. See Def's Exhibit A at 3 (BMS is a listed defendant for the brief that argues that ""Plaintiffs' indirect-
purchaser claim under the Donnelly Act must be dismissed as a matter of law under controlling New York precedent""), 8 (""Just 
as Plaintiffs' indirect-purchaser claim would be barred under federal antitrust law, it is barred under the Donnelly Act"") and 10 
(""State policy, statutory language and legislative history only confirm the conclusion that New York antitrust law should follow 
the Illinois Brick bar against indirect purchaser actions"")."
483,4," In their reply, BMS argues that although the legislature intended the Donnelly Act to be consistent with federal antitrust law, 
the enactment of the Donnelly Act was prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick and at that time the ""vast majority of 
federal courts, including the Second Circuit, interpreted the Sherman Act to allow indirect purchaser recovery."" Pl's Reply at 7. 
BMS offers only one case, West Virginia v. Charles Pfizer & Co., 440 F.2d 1079, 1088 (2d Cir. 1971), to support this assertion 
and that case discussed the issue only in dicta and therefore is not dispositive. See Donson Stores, Inc. v. American Bakeries 
Co., 58 F.R.D. 481, 485 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (rejecting proposed intervenors' reliance on West Virginia v. Charles Pfizer, because 
the ""sole question presented [in West Virginia] was whether the District Court had abused its discretion in approving a settlement 
proposed by most of the wholesalers, retailers, individual customers and defendants"" and the West Virginia Court ""expressly 
recognized that it was not called upon to decide the question raised here, specifically stating that it 'should not reach any 
dispositive conclusions on [this] admittedly unsettled legal [issue]. . . '""). Moreover, the Donson Court noted that ""no court 
actually faced with the problem [of indirect purchaser liability under the Sherman Act] since Hanover has held that the ultimate 
consumers, rather than those more directly injured, are the proper parties to avail themselves of the provisions of the Sherman 
Act. Instead, the Courts have uniformly held precisely the contrary."" Donson, 58 F.R.D. at 485. "
484,5," Under New York law, a retroactive statute ""is a law which looks backward affecting acts occurring or rights accruing before it 
came into force."" West Publishing Co., McKinney's Consol. Laws of N.Y., Book 1, Statutes, ยง 51(a) (1971) (""McKinney Statutes 
Law"")."
484,6," HN5[
] New York law dictates that a statutory ""amendment will have prospective application only, and will have no retroactive 
effect unless the language of the statute clearly indicates that it shall receive a contrary interpretation."" McKinney Statutes Law ยง 
52. This is particularly true where the plain language of the statute dictates that it ""shall take effect immediately."" Id. (comment); 
see also Majewski v. Broadalbin-Perth Central School District, 91 N.Y.2d 577, 583-84, 673 N.Y.S.2d 966, 696 N.E.2d 978 (N.Y. 
1998) (""It takes a clear expression of the legislative purpose to justify retroactive application"")."
484,7," The Comment to McKinney Statutes Law ยง 54 clearly states that, HN6[
] under New York law, the presumption of 
prospectivity applies to all statutes ""whereby a new right is established even though it is remedial."" McKinney Statutes Law ยง 54 
(Comment). The 1998 Amendment to the Donnelly Act could be interpreted as providing indirect purchasers a new right to claim 
damages for antitrust violations where none existed before. Further support for this interpretation may be found in the use of the 
word ""shall,"" which is generally understood to indicate that prospective construction was contemplated. See Dillon v. Coughlin, 
143 Misc. 2d 207, 539 N.Y.S.2d 880, 885 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1989). "
485,8," The antecedent right affected need not be constitutionally protected from change in order for the presumption against 
retroactivity to apply. HN12[
] See McKinney Statutes Law ยง 53 (Comment) (""So a preexisting right or liability, whether or not it is constitutionally protected from change, will not be affected by legislation, unless legislative intent to the contrary is obvious""). "
486,9," In a case such as this one, involving both indirect claims under state law and direct claims under federal law, the only way to 
avoid ""duplicative recovery"" is to deny indirect purchasers any overcharge damages at all, since presumably all antitrust injuries 
were redressed through the federal proceeding. "
502,1," While Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint also includes an allegation of interference with contract, its brief focuses 
exclusively on interference with its prospective business relationship with Behr. (Second Am. Compl. P 57; Resp. at 17.) 
Accordingly, the court discusses that claim alone. "
506,2," The courts findings on this claim will necessarily result in dismissal of Plaintiff's prayer for equitable estoppel. See infra Part 
IV.G.2."
506,3," Indeed, U.S. Can takes the position that the two companies were not potential competitors when the 1996 Agreement was 
executed. (Resp. at 41-42.)"
506,4," The court has previously found that the written 1996 Agreement is dated April 3, 1991. The court reaffirms that finding here. 
Thus, Plaintiff has the burden of showing that the writing is the product of a unilateral or mutual mistake. "
507,5," The Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981. See 
Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
508,6," The driving principle behind cases like Lanyon was the facilitation of economic development. See Walter F. Pratt, Jr., American 
Contract Law at the Turn of the Century, 39 S.C. L. REV. 415, 433-38 (1988). Such an interpretation comports nicely with the 
recognition that modern law promotes economic output by encouraging cooperation. Covenants forbidding the use of 
confidential information allow parties to discuss business strategy freely, yet not worry they are cutting their throats by doing so. "
511,7," In employer-employee settings, long-term employment normally is consideration for the reciprocal covenant not to compete. 
See, e.g., Curtis 1000, Inc. v. Suess, 24 F.3d 941, 945-46 (7th Cir. 1994). But this need not be the case; all that is necessary is 
that there is valid consideration for the covenant, and that it is subordinate to some other existing legitimate ""transaction or 
relationship."" RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS ยง 187 (1981) (emphasis supplied). "
514,8," Uniqueness is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition to finding a near-permanent customer base. A customer base is not 
near-permanent because a product is unique. Rather, it is because a product is unique that one might infer that one's product 
base is near-permanent. "
516,9," The restraint considered in Engine Specialties, 605 F.2d 1, differs from this case in the crucial respect that it was not ancillary 
to any business relationship or transaction. Here, the covenant is ancillary to the agreement to negotiate in good faith."
516,10," If Plaintiff is correct, then the record reflects that U.S. Can had a market share of approximately 45 percent of the relevant 
market in (and this is not clear) either 1996 or 2000. (Sherwin Decl.) "
517,11," An injunction may issue even in the absence of a restrictive covenant. See Televation Telecomm. Sys., Inc. v. Saindon, 169 Ill. 
App. 3d 8, 522 N.E.2d 1359, 1362, 119 Ill. Dec. 500 (Ill. App. Ct. 1988); see generally Anthony C. Valiulis, Can't Keep a Secret, 
CBA RECORD 28 (January 1995). "
530,1," All reference to ""evidence"" means summary judgment evidence. "
545,1," District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found in United States v. Microsoft, 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 1999), that 
Microsoft has engaged in anti-competitive practices with respect to its operating systems. That decision has spawned a number 
of state court actions against Microsoft, brought throughout the country pursuant to state antitrust laws."
545,2," It is interesting but not integral to this discussion that the complaint alleges the following counterbalance to the alleged 
monopolistic overcharge: ""At all times relevant, Microsoft has marketed and licensed an Internet browser [specialized software 
program allowing a PC user access to the Internet] known as 'Internet Explorer'"". Complaint, P35. ""Internet browsers that "
546,," compete with Microsoft's Internet Explorer by themselves . . . posed, and have continued to pose, a serious competitive threat to 
Microsoft's operating system monopoly."" Complaint, P37. ""A monopolist's weapon of choice is monopoly power."" Complaint, 
P42. ""Microsoft sank hundreds of millions of dollars into testing and promotion of Internet Explorer, and then distributed that 
product without separate charge. Such actions would only make sense to a predatory monopolist. As if any further explanation of 
that behavior were necessary, [one of] Microsoft's Vice President['s] . . . told industry executives: 'We are going to cut off 
[Netscape's] air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to give away for free.'"" Complaint, P45."
546,3," HN3[
] General Statutes ยง 35-27 provides that ""every contract, combination, or conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."" This statute has not been amended since its enactment in 1971. 
Nor has General Statutes ยง 35-35 been amended since its 1971 enactment, except to substitute ""chapter"" for ""part"" in 1975, to 
read as follows: ""The state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a consumer, injured in its business or property by any 
violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable attorney's fee and costs."" "
547,4," As alleged in the complaint, the ""purchase"" in issue is actually a license to use the Windows 98 operating system. ""As a 
precondition to his first use of Windows 98, Plaintiff and all others similarly situated were compelled to accept and agree to a 
direct end-user license directly from Microsoft, pursuant to the terms of which Microsoft dictated, and Plaintiff and all others 
similarly agreed, that Windows 98 was 'licensed, not sold.'"" Complaint, P7. Software manufacturers are compelled to use end-
user licensing agreements (EULAs) in order to protect their intellectual property in the operating system under the ""first sale"" 
doctrine of federal copyright law. See Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers & Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y. 
1994)."
547,5," The court notes that a decision by the legislature to overrule a proposal to modify an existing statute, after the statute has been 
judicially interpreted, has been deemed to validate the judicial interpretation. See Comm'n on Human Rights and Opportunities v. 
Sullivan Associates, 250 Conn. 763, 783, 739 A.2d 238 (1999); Hanson v. Transportation General, Inc., 245 Conn. 613, 618-19, 
716 A.2d 857 (1998). "
548,6," Vacco also argues that inclusion of the word ""consumer"" in General Statutes ยง 35-35 distinguishes the Connecticut statute from 
federal antitrust legislation, and for that reason alone, the Illinois Brick indirect purchaser rule should be disregarded. While it is 
true that the word ""consumer"" does not appear in ยง 4 of the Clayton Act, it has significant meaning in federal antitrust 
jurisprudence. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979), the Supreme Court held that 
consumers have standing to bring antitrust actions under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act, reversing lower court decisions holding that the 
act was intended to limit standing to those engaged in commercial ventures. Vacco offers no authority for the proposition that 
inclusion of the word ""consumer"" in the Connecticut legislation provides anything more or less than the same right of action to 
individuals asserting antitrust violations under our state law."
548,7, See above discussion at note 4.
548,8," Indeed, Judge Jackson found in United States v. Microsoft, supra, 84 F. Supp. 2d 27, that ""it is not possible with the available 
data to determine with any level of confidence whether the price that a profit-maximizing firm with monopoly power would charge 
for Windows 98 comports with the price that Microsoft actually charges and that Microsoft's price is less than the profit 
maximizing monopoly price."" In other words, determining ascertainable damages in a case such as this would be next to 
impossible. "
549,9," See Lowell v. American Cyanamid Co., 177 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 1999). "
557,1," Oftentimes, the toll rates were increased pursuant to a federal court order which came out of a lawsuit brought by bondholders 
against the City. "
558,2," 29 U.S.C. ยง 301 reads, HN4[
] ""Except as provided in section 129 of this title with respect to certain toll bridges and toll tunnels, all highways constructed under the provisions of this title shall be free from tolls of all kinds."""
558,29," U.S.C. ยง 129(a)(3) reads: HN5[
] Before the Secretary may permit Federal participation under this subsection in construction of a highway, bridge, 
or tunnel located in a State, the public authority (including the State transportation department) having jurisdiction over the 
highway, bridge, or tunnel must enter into an agreement with the Secretary which provides that all toll revenues received 
from operation of the toll facility will be used first for debt service, for reasonable return on investment of any private person 
financing the project, and for the costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the toll facility, including 
reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. If the State certifies annually that the tolled facility is being 
adequately maintained, the State may use any toll revenues in excess of amounts required under the preceding sentence 
for any purpose for which Federal funds may be obligated by a State under this title."
558,3," In Clallam County v. Washington, the Ninth Circuit held that ยง 301 provides the predicate right giving rise to a ยง 1983 action, 
because while Congress neither created nor prohibited an express remedy under Title 23, ยง 301 (mandating toll-free bridges) 
was intended to aid bridge users, by providing free access across waterways. Therefore, the plaintiffs were members of a class 
granted enforceable rights.  849 F.2d 424, 429 (9th Cir. 1988)."
558,4," Under Cort, to determine if Congress intended to create a private right of action, the court would consider: 1) whether the 
plaintiff is a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted; 2) whether there is any indication of legislative intent 
to create or deny such a remedy; 3) whether an implied remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the statutory 
scheme; and 4) whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to the states so that it would be inappropriate to infer a 
federal remedy.  Cort, 422 U.S. at 78. "
559,5," Generally, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, was established ""to 
develop a national intermodal surface transportation system, to authorize funds for construction of highways, for highway safety 
programs, and for mass transit programs, and for other purposes."" (codified as amended at 23 U.S.C. ยง 129 (2000))."
559,6," ""The public-private partnership is important and should be encouraged. From the Federal perspective, one of the ways to 
approach infrastructure improvement would be to ease unnecessary Federal constraints preventing the mixing of Federal dollars 
with private funds on projects."" Id. at 27. "
560,7," 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 provides in pertinent part, HN11[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine 
or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."" Originally, plaintiffs sought relief pursuant to ยง 1 of the Sherman Act 
as well. However, as they fail to raise any argument concerning ยง 1 in their briefs, we will address their ยง 2 claim only. "
561,8," See O.K. Sand & Gravel, 36 F.3d at 573 (""if . . . [plaintiff] were arguing that it was injured as a consumer, higher prices in output 
due to an unlawful combination would be the 'type' of injury the antitrust laws intend to prevent"")."
561,9," On appeal, plaintiffs rely solely on their assertion that the City abused its market power by raising the Skyway tolls and using 
revenues for non-Tollway expenses. They do not revisit their argument that the City has engaged in an unlawful tying 
arrangement by conditioning access to the Skyway on payment of money to fund non-Skyway transportation improvements. 
Even if they did, a review of the law and common sense suggests that this argument also fails. ""A tying arrangement cannot 
exist unless two separate product markets have been linked."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 20-21, 80 
L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). Drivers who pay Skyway tolls are not purchasing a separate product that is somehow linked 
to the Skyway. The non-Skyway transportation improvements involve streets and roads throughout the city that drivers use for 
free."
561,10," As we have found that plaintiffs cannot meet the requirements to show a ยง 2 Sherman Act violation, we need not reach the 
City's state action immunity defense. "
563,11," Even though it considered the Port's activity a hybrid of market regulation and participation, the court in New Orleans 
Steamship, affirmed the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims. The Fifth Circuit held that charging ships for access to 
certain services was permissible under the Commerce Clause.  New Orleans Steamship, 874 F.2d at 1022. "
587,1," Milnot is jointly owned by its management and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, LP, a private venture capital firm based in 
Chicago, Illinois. See Compl. P4, Milnot Ans. P1. For clarity, Milnot is referred to by the trade name ""Beech-Nut"" throughout this 
opinion. "
588,2," Defendants' expert could not, however, rule out the possibility that Gerber's price increases are attributable to increased 
production costs. See Tr. 1026-27."
588,3," Ninety percent of all purchasers of baby food say that they make their purchases at grocery stores or supermarkets. See PX 98 
at 530. See id. Twenty-seven percent say that they purchase baby food at discount superstores such as Wal-Mart or K-Mart. 
Gerber's market share figure is even higher when mass merchandiser sales are included. The percentage of mass merchandiser 
sales compared to grocery store sales is growing. See Tr. 986-987. "
590,4," The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (""HHI"") is the sum of the squares of the market shares of all of the firms in a given market. It is 
an article of faith for the FTC, and it is recited in the FTC's Merger Guidelines, that any market with an HHI above 1800 is highly 
concentrated and that any merger in such a market that increases HHI by 100 or more points is presumptively anticompetitive."
590,5," IRI (""Information Resources, Inc."") provides data concerning cash register transactions that are commonly used in the food 
industry for market analysis. "
591,6," The FTC challenged Dr. Baker's econometrics survey by arguing that it failed to consider the transaction price, i.e., the price 
after couponing, and relied instead on the shelf price. Dr. Baker convincingly responded by demonstrating that couponing occurs 
regardless of competition and that couponing does not greatly affect price over time. "
592,7," The Commission's argument that further concentration in the baby food industry will increase the likelihood of collusion was 
effectively rebutted by Dr. Baker's testimony regarding the structural market barriers to collusion in the market. See Tr. 1010-
1023. "
593,8," The failure of Heinz's attempt to launch its Earth's Best brand, supra, may or may not have been foreordained by Heinz's low 
ACV. The testimony of Heinz witnesses was that Gerber responded immediately to Earth's Best with its own new label, and that 
Gerber, with its ACV of nearly 100, was able to overwhelm Heinz's launch effort. See Tr. 446. "
594,9," The parties have not stressed private equities, but I have nevertheless considered them. The private equities here -- the 
corporate interests of Heinz and Milnot and especially the interests of Dearborn Capital Partners LP, which presumably acquired 
Milnot through a leveraged buyout with the purpose and intent of selling its interest at a profit -- are undoubtedly important to the 
private parties, but they do not affect the outcome of this matter. Beech-Nut asks me to recognize, perhaps as an equity matter, a variant of the ""failing firm defense."" See Dr Pepper/Seven-Up 
Cos. v. FTC, 301 U.S. App. D.C. 150, 991 F.2d 859, 864-65 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The argument is that the static state of the baby 
food market will make Beech-Nut's outmoded means of production less and less profitable, eventually rendering Beech-Nut 
uncompetitive and reducing the market to two firms. I have given no weight to this argument. Beech-Nut may have indeed 
realized its maximum profit potential, and it may be unable to boost production or distribution. At present, however, it is a 
profitable and ongoing enterprise. "
600,1, Plaintiff also argues that it would be socially wasteful for it to duplicate Defendant's efforts in implementing such a system. 
601,2," The Court heard argument on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction one day before the Tampa Bay Classic was scheduled to 
begin and was thus unable to rule on the Motion in time for the tournament. The Motion is still pertinent, however, in that 
Defendant sponsors tournaments on a near weekly basis such that the issues raised in the Motion still necessitate an 
expeditious ruling."
601,3," HN2[
] The Court's analysis of the Sherman Act also applies to the Florida Antitrust Act, which mirrors Section 2 of the Sherman Act and provides that ""in construing this chapter, due consideration and great weight [shall] be given to the 
interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal anti-trust statutes."" Fla. Stat. ยง 542.19. "
602,," In applying this provision, Florida courts have held that the Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the

603,4," Plaintiff has pointed out that the individuals responsible for gathering and transmitting scores from the golf course are unpaid 
volunteers and thus disputes that Defendant incurs substantial costs in operating RTSS. Defendant has cited other operational 
expenses, however, such as staffing and maintenance of its production truck, training volunteers, and the cost and operation of 
the hand-held transmitting devices, to refute Plaintiff's suggestion that Defendant's costs in operating RTSS are negligible. 
Although at present there is insufficient evidence before the Court to determine the exact amount of Defendant's operational 
costs, it would appear to be greater than the amount for which Plaintiff is willing to give credit. See Baseman Aff. FN 5."
603,5," The NBA had also argued in support of its motion for an injunction that the scores were protected under federal copyright laws. 
The court rejected this argument, holding that although broadcasts are protected under copyright law, the basketball scores 
themselves were not because they represented ""purely factual information which any patron of an NBA game could acquire from 
the arena."" Motorola, 105 F.3d at 847. By merely watching the game, the factual data could be obtained without resorting to any 
gathering technique used by the NBA or listening to broadcasters' description of the play-by-play color of the game. Id. "
604,6," While in a given golf tournament there may be some 200 players competing, television broadcasts typically track only the 
""leader-board,"" which displays the top scores among the entire field. Therefore, someone outside the golf course would be

620,19," Defendants argue that proof of actual detrimental effects on competition only serves as a proxy for market power, and that 
such proof does not dispense with plaintiffs' duty to define the relevant market. This attempt to distinguish market power from 
market definition is unpersuasive, as ""market definition merely provides an analytical framework for assessing market power, 
which in turn is fundamental to the determination of whether the conduct in question can harm competition and consumers."" 
James A. Keyte, Market Definition and Differentiated Products: The Need for A Workable Standard, 63 Antitrust L.J. 697, 697 
(1995). Thus, a showing of manifest anticompetitive effects a fortiori renders unnecessary the definition of a relevant market."
620,20," The definition of the appropriate market is particularly complicated given the number of factors that may be part of the complex 
calculus performed by airline customers in choosing an airport and airline when traveling to and from the Washington, D.C., 
metropolitan area. Cf. 7 Phillip Areeda, Antitrust Law P 553, at 238 (consumer preferences may narrow the relevant geographic 
market). For example, few, if any, commercial flights in excess of 1,250 miles take off from Reagan National, while the range of 
flights departing from Dulles is not so limited. See 49 U.S.C. ยงยง 49109, 41718; 14 C.F.R. ยง 93.253 (2000). This complexity 
especially underscores the inappropriateness of threshold disposition of the question of the relevant market."
620,21," See, e.g., Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 336--37 (""Congress prescribed a pragmatic, factual approach to the definition of the 
relevant market . . . . The geographic market selected must . . . correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and be 
economically significant."")"
620,22," Defendants' reliance on America Online, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 857--59, is also misplaced. That case involved a Section 2 
monopolization claim in which proper market definition was critical to the plaintiff's pleading burden. See, e.g., Antitrust Law 
Developments 495 (4th ed. 1997) (""Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, identification of the relevant market is the equivalent of 
a jurisdictional element essential to proving monopolization or attempt to monopolize."") (footnote omitted). Here, however, 
market analysis may be unnecessary if, as plaintiffs allege, defendants' agreement has obvious anticompetitive effects and has 
no countervailing procompetitive justifications. See, e.g., Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 458--61; Virginia Vermiculite, 108 
F. Supp. 2d at 571. America Online is further distinguishable, as the alleged relevant market there, unlike the market alleged in 
this case, was patently implausible. See America Online, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 858--59. "

different or more detailed in some respects than the market alleged in the complaint."

622,26," For similar reasons, defendants' argument that plaintiffs do not have ""antitrust standing""--that is, that even if plaintiffs suffered 
""antitrust injury,"" other prudential considerations make them improper plaintiffs under Section 4 of the Clayton Act--is 
unpersuasive. Defendants are correct that ""[a] showing of antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish 
standing under ยง 4, because a party may have suffered antitrust injury but may not be a proper plaintiff under ยง 4 for other 
reasons."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110 n.5, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986); see also

allegations concerning detrimental effects on consumers, on which defendants myopically focus, it also includes the requisite 
allegations of antitrust injury to plaintiffs' business and property. As such, defendants' standing argument is unpersuasive."

with prospective economic advantage are common-law tort claims does not insulate these claims from preemption, for they 
nevertheless involve the ""enactment or enforcement"" of state laws. Id.; cf. Smith, 134 F.3d at 259 (holding that false 
imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims are preempted to the extent that they relate to an airline's 
boarding practices). Moreover, simply because Virginia's antitrust and conspiracy statutes are statutes of general application does not preclude ADA 
preemption, for the Supreme Court has rejected the notion that ""only state laws specifically addressed to the airline industry are

635,5," Although not raised in the briefs relevant to Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court notes the presence of an additional basis 
for dismissing Count I of Plaintiff's Complaint. As mentioned previously, Count I alleges that Defendants violated Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. As a threshold matter, HN6[
] conduct violates Section 2 only when it ""threatens actual monopolization,"" unreasonable restraint of trade is ""not enough."" See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767. Plaintiff has not alleged any facts relevant to 
Defendants' market share. Instead, Plaintiff claims that Defendants' alleged refusal to deal constitutes a ""per se violation"" of 
Section 2. See Complaint at 22, P 77. Apparently, Plaintiff has borrowed the concept of a ""per se violation"" from the Section 1 
context and has attempted to extend it into the Section 2 context. This Court is unable to find any case law which recognizes or 
employs such an extension. This absence is not surprising since HN7[
] the rationale for using the ""per se"" analysis where a 
restraint of trade has been alleged is not readily applicable to the monopoly context. Courts have applied a rule of per se 
illegality to certain types of practices which ""almost always have anticompetitive effects without offsetting pro-competitive 
effects."" Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 817-18 (3rd Cir. 1984). There is no application of the per se doctrine under 
Section 2 because there is not a similar pattern with regard to monopoly -- that is, these same types of practices, while they may 
""almost always"" lead to unfair restraint of trade, do not ""almost always"" lead to monopoly. Thus, Plaintiff's failure to allege any 
facts with regard to Defendant's market share is not cured by its allegation of a per se violation of Section 2. Absent facts 
pertaining to market share, there is no basis upon which a fact finder could conclude that monopoly was ""actually threatened."" 
See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim of conspiracy to 
monopolize under Section 2 of the Sherman Act."
635,6," Notably, Plaintiff does not allege that the merger between Exxon and Mobil violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act. See 
Complaint at 23."
635,7," Section 7 provides in relevant part: HN10[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the 
whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade 
Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any 
activity affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the 
country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
635,15, U.S.C. ยง 18.
635,8," HN11[
] Section 7 claims for monetary damages generally do not lie against the seller of the assets. See, e.g., Dailey v. Quality School Plan. Inc., 380 F.2d 484, 488 (5th Cir. 1967). However, this Court recognizes that equitable relief, which Plaintiff "
636,," seeks here, may in some cases lie against the seller of the assets pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง 25. See, e.g., United States v. Coca-
Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 575 F.2d 222, 230-31 (9th Cir.1978), see also United States v. E.I. Pont de Nemours & Co., 
366 U.S. 316, 326-31, 6 L. Ed. 2d 318, 81 S. Ct. 1243 (1961). Thus, the absence of Tosco from Plaintiff's First Amended 
Complaint may not, in fact, be a fatal flaw."
636,9," Defendants further insist that DAG's ""real complaint"" is that it would have been a more effective competitor and that Section 7 
does not require a company selling assets to sell to the most effective competitor. See Def. Reply at 5. If Defendants are correct 
that DAG's real argument is that it would have been a better choice than Tosco for the sale of a portion of the Divestiture Assets, 
Defendants are also correct that Section 7 does not offer a remedy for such a complaint. HN12[
] Section 7 exists to protect competition, not competitors. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 320 (""Taken as a whole, the legislative history [of Section 7] 
illuminates congressional concern with the protection of competition, not competitors, and its desire to restrain mergers only to 
the extent that such combinations may tend to lessen competition.""). "

651,2, The factual data is public information and both parties concede that it is not entitled to copyright protection per se. 
653,3," The court specifically notes some of the following palpable differences. The competing works are in different mediums: 
plaintiff's being a print publication, and defendant's an internet web site. They are very different in appearance. The organization 
and layout are different. Plaintiff uses large-scale tables with information for up to 20 districts on each page, while defendant's 
web site presents each school district individually on a separately linked web page. Defendant has no tables comparable to 
plaintiff's large-scale data tables. Defendant's site does not use a column and row grid like plaintiff's but rather presents its data 
in well-defined groupings. Furthermore, the topical categories used to organize defendant's site differ widely in number and the 
actual heading used from plaintiff's, and only five of the topical headings are identically named. (See Kathleen Kelly Aff. P7.) 
Plaintiff puts all information about athletics into a separate set of tables while defendant integrated information regarding 
athletics into his main display. Plaintiff has separate sections for charter schools and alternative schools; defendant does not 
have these categories but rather has a ""specialized schools"" category. (See Margaret Richardson Aff. P16.) Defendant includes 
information on preschools and universities; plaintiff does not. (Id.) Plaintiff's directory has advertisements throughout; while the 
defendant's does not."
653,4," Copyright protection is minimal when factual materials can only be selected or arranged in a limited universe of meaningful 
ways. Kregos, 3 F.3d at 664 (""Much of the similarity โฆ is necessitated because there are a limited number of statistics generally 
considered outcome-predictive by those familiar with the sport."") "
654,5," The court notes that even in the absence of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, the state claims lack merit and defendant would be 
granted summary judgment. In relevant part, a party violates the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act when he passes off 
goods or services as those of another, or causes a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to: (a) the source, 
sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services; (b) affiliation, connection, sponsorship, or association by another; or 
(c) any other conduct that creates a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding. Minn. Stat. ยง 325D.44, subd. 1 (1998). While 
proof of actual confusion is not required, a party alleging a violation of the deceptive trade practices act must show there is a 
likelihood of confusion. See McClure v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 29 F. Supp. 2d 1046, 1065 (D. Minn. 1998), aff'd, 223 
F.3d 845 (8th Cir. 2000). The court concludes that plaintiff has made no such showing here. Furthermore, it is highly improbable 
that any consumer would be confused or misunderstand that defendant's web site is unaffiliated with plaintiff's magazine. 
Schoolhouse publishes a periodical magazine that disseminates factual information about school districts, whereas Anderson is 
a real estate agent of residential properties. Anderson's website is clearly labeled as his own and bears little similarity to 
Schoolhouse's publication. Plaintiff fails to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find in its favor on the 
alleged violation of Minn. Stat. ยง 325D.44. See id."
654,6, The standard for summary judgment as laid out above will also be applied here. See supra pp. 3-4.

660,1, We will refer to Spectators' and Mitchell collectively as Spectators'. 
665,2," ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and 
those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. 
Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). "
666,3," Mitchell's testimony about these conversations with sponsors appears to be vulnerable to hearsay objection. However, 
Anheuser-Busch does not object to it and Spectators' argues that it is admissible as co-conspirator hearsay. Because the district 
court did not rule on the admissibility of the evidence, we will not do so in the first instance, but will consider it part of the record 
for the sake of argument. "
674,*, District Judge of the Western District of Texas sitting by designation. 
675,1," For a history of the controversy between the parties in this case, see Bayou Fleet, 68 F. Supp. 2d at 736-743."
675,2," A third sand pit, owned by the Giambelluca family, went out of business after a dispute between the Giambellucas and the 
Clulees. See Giambelluca v. Parish, 687 So. 2d 423 (La. Ct. App. 5th Cir. 1996). "
676,3," The zoning ordinance restricted the operation of sand pits, but allowed preexisting sand pits to continue in use as long as 
operations did not cease for six months. Therefore, Bayou Fleet could continue its non-conforming use so long as it had not let 
its sand pit business cease operations for six months."
676,4," The Clulees also attempted to sway public officials without Alexander's help. On May 30, 1997 and July 3, 1997, Mary Clulee 
wrote to the Corps of Engineers protesting Adams' proposed dredging permit. Mrs. Clulee claimed that Adams intended to 
dredge sand from a section of the river located immediately in front of the Clulees' property. Despite Adams' assurance in June 
of 1997 that it would not dredge in front of the Clulee property, the Clulees maintained their opposition to the project. "
677,5," Bayou Fleet cites several cases from this Court where either counsel or the judge should have been disqualified because of a 
law clerk's special knowledge of a case. See Hall v. Small Business Administration, 695 F.2d 175 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding that a 
law clerk's continuing participation with a judge in a case in which her future employer was counsel gave rise to an appearance 
of impartiality); Fredonia Broadcasting Corp. v. RCA Corp., 569 F.2d 251 (5th Cir. 1978) (concluding that counsel had an unfair 
advantage because he worked as the judge's law clerk in an earlier trial of the case); Kennedy v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co., Inc., 551 F.2d 593 (5th Cir. 1977) (holding that a law clerk could not gain special knowledge of a case through his own 
investigation of the facts). The law clerk in this case did not have special knowledge of the facts that would raise an appearance 
of impartiality. These cases do not address the issue of whether a law clerk's participation at trial precludes a litigant's right of 
access to the courts. "
679,6," The district court's order states, ""The evidence supports the Parish Council's conclusion that Bayou Fleet did not lose its non-
conforming status."" See Bayou Fleet v. Alexander, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15567, at *21, 1997 WL 625492, *8 (E.D. La. 1997). 
Put into context, the court's assertion indicates that the defendants did not provide adequate reasons why special legal counsel 
should be appointed since the Parish Council had previously investigated Bayou Fleet's zoning status. See id. The court did not 
reach a legal conclusion concerning the zoning ordinance's applicability to Bayou Fleet. "
680,7," Noerr-Pennington immunity does not stem solely from the First Amendment; rather, it is inextricably associated with 
interpretations of the Sherman Act. See Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir. 1983). The Tenth Circuit 
has pointed out that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine should not describe immunity that arises only from the First Amendment right 
to petition. See Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 208 F.3d 885, 888-91 (10th Cir. 2000) (""While we do 
not question the application of the right to petition outside of antitrust, it is a bit of a misnomer to refer to it as the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine . . ..""). However, HN15[
] where an individual's conduct raises Noerr-Pennington immunity under antitrust law, the same conduct ""is also out of the scope of section 1983 liability."" Video Int'l Prod., Inc., 858 F.2d at 1084. The Clulees 
may be entitled to immunity both under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine for purposes of antitrust liability and the First Amendment 
for purposes of Bayou Fleet's section 1983 claim. Because the same facts and legal analysis apply to both theories of immunity, 
we will not make a distinction between the two."
680,8," In Acoustic Systems, we stated that HN20[
] the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not provide persons complete immunity 
from suit; rather, the ""doctrine provides only an affirmative defense . . .."" Acoustic Systems, Inc., 207 F.3d at 296. The trial court 
erred in holding that Noerr-Pennington immunity should not be raised as an affirmative defenses. "
681,9," Bayou Fleet urges this Court to ignore the Noerr-Pennington doctrine because the defendants were allegedly involved in a civil 
rights conspiracy. HN23[
] A conspiracy exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity has been explicitly rejected by the Supreme 
Court unless the conspiracy ""reaches beyond mere anticompetitive motivation."" Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. at 383. 
Bayou Fleet did not allege that the Clulees motives included anything other than their desire to put its sand pit out of business. "
694,1," HN3[

Superior Court . . . mail a copy of the complaint . . . to the Attorney General.l "
704,1," Honorable William L. Dwyer, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation."
704,2," The plaintiffs are Knevelbaard Dairies, a general partnership, and John and Sam Knevelbaard. They sue for themselves and a 
putative class of others similarly situated. We express no opinion as to whether a class should be certified pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23."
704,3," The defendants are Kraft Foods, Inc. (""Kraft""), Alpine Lace Brands, Inc., and Borden, Inc. The district court dismissed the 
action as to a fourth defendant, National Cheese Exchange, for lack of personal jurisdiction; the milk producers have expressly 
waived any appeal from that order. "
705,4," The milk producers say: ""The district court demonstrated its intent to issue an appealable dismissal by directing that it be 
entered pursuant to the rule governing entry of judgments. See Martinez v. Gomez, 137 F.3d 1124, 1126 (9th Cir. 1998) (order 
of dismissal appealable when district court intended it to end the action)."" The cheese makers say: ""The district court dismissed 
this action on December 4, 1998."" They conclude: ""Nor could any amendment consistent with Knevelbaard's core allegations 
possibly cure the deficiencies in its complaint. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the district court's decision to dismiss 
Knevelbaard's case with prejudice should be affirmed."" "
709,5," The milk producers do not contend that they are exempt from the antitrust injury requirement because the cheese makers 
committed a per se violation, nor would any such contention be tenable. They argue only that once a per se violation is proved 
they need not show market power, and in that they are correct (see supra Section V.B); they still must prove injury in fact and 
antitrust injury. "
710,6," Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), cited by the cheese makers, 
is plainly inapplicable. In American Ad Management, 190 F.3d at 1056, we described that case as follows: Due to the vagaries of the bowling industry, Brunswick, a large bowling equipment manufacturer, had become ""by far the 
largest operator of bowling centers"" in the country.  Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 480, 97 S. Ct. 690. Pueblo challenged 
Brunswick's acquisition of some of Pueblo's competitors who were on the verge of bankruptcy. Pueblo alleged that the 
acquisitions threatened to create a monopoly, given Brunswick's market power. Pueblo's claimed injury was the additional 
profit it would have earned had its competitors been allowed to fold. See id. at 479-80, 97 S. Ct. 690. The Supreme Court 
held that Pueblo's claimed injury did not flow from the illegality of Brunswick's conduct. If the acquisitions violated ยง 7, it was 
only because the acquisitions ""brought a 'deep pocket' parent into a market of 'pygmies.'"" Id. at 487, 97 S. Ct. 690. Pueblo's 
injuries, however, were unrelated to Brunswick's potential to monopolize, that which made the acquisition potentially 
unlawful. Any rescue of the troubled centers would injure Pueblo in the same way. Atlantic Richfield Co., 495 U.S. 328, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884, involved a vertical maximum price arrangement. A 
gasoline retailer complained that low retail prices imposed by an oil company on its dealers, competitors of the plaintiff, were 
depriving the plaintiff of business. The Court held that the claimed injury did not stem ""from a competition-reducing aspect or "
711,," effect of the defendants' behavior."" Here, in contrast to these and other cases cited by defendants, the claimed injury flows 
directly from that which makes the defendants' conduct unlawful."
711,7," Other cases holding that antitrust claims may be pursued by parties injured as the result of the knowing and collusive 
submission of false information to a government agency include Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Tariff Bureau, 690 F.2d 
1240, 1261 (9th Cir. 1982); Israel v. Baxter Labs., 151 U.S. App. D.C. 101, 466 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1972); Outboard Marine 
Corp. v. Pezetel, 474 F. Supp. 168 (D. Del. 1979); and Litton Sys. v. AT&T, 487 F. Supp. 942, 956 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (""The system 
of administrative supervision is not undercut but is complemented and reinforced by affording judicial relief for cynical evasion or 
corruption of that system for unfair competitive advantage"")."
711,8," HN23[
] To constitute horizontal price fixing, the agreement among competitors need not involve the ultimate price. In 
Socony-Vacuum, the Court condemned a concerted program by oil companies to purchase surplus gasoline on the spot market "
712,," to prevent prices from falling, noting that even if the conspirators ""were in no position to control the market, to the extent that 
they raised, lowered, or stabilized prices they would be directly interfering with the free play of market forces."" 310 U.S. at 221. 
See also Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 648, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 1925 (1980) (agreement to 
standardize credit terms ""falls squarely within the traditional per se rule against price fixing""); Plymouth Dealers' Ass'n v. United

F. Supp. 869 (E.D. Cal. 1986) (use of standardized cooling and pelletizing charge)."
712,9," The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs ""sold milk directly or indirectly to one or more of the defendants"" and that the putative 
class is composed of ""all persons who reside in the State of California and who sold milk, directly or indirectly, to any of the 
defendants during the period from January 1, 1988, to April 1997."" (Emphasis added.) The parties have not briefed, and we 
need not decide, whether milk sellers who sold to non-conspirator buyers, at prices claimed to be artificially low because of the 
market effects of defendants' conspiracy, would have standing to seek damages from defendants. There is a split of authority on 
that subject. See, e.g., In re Arizona Dairy Products Litigation, 627 F. Supp. 233, 235-36 (D. Ariz. 1985) (standing granted); In re 
Copper Antitrust Litigation, 98 F. Supp. 2d 1039 (W.D. Wis. 2000) (standing granted); FTC. v. Mylan Lab., Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d

714,10," The cheese makers' reliance on Day v. AT&T Corp., 63 Cal. App. 4th 325 (1998), is misplaced. That case involved rates filed 
with the Federal Communications Commission. See id. at 337 (""The net effect of imposing any monetary sanction on the 
respondents will be to effectuate a rebate, thereby resulting in discriminatory rates. As we have seen, this is a matter which is 
strictly of federal concern under the [Federal Communications] Act, and is, therefore, barred by the filed rate doctrine.""). "

are collected at ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Developments, 745-46 (4th ed. 1997). "
716,1," My conclusion regarding the first claim dictates the same result on plaintiffs' second claim for relief for violation of California's 
unfair competition law, Bus. & Prof. Code ยงยง 17200 et seq. As set forth below, plaintiffs did not allege any anti-competitive effect 
of defendants' alleged collusion. Plaintiffs remained free to sell their milk at any price above the support level. The behavior that 
plaintiffs allege caused the California Department of Food and Agriculture (""CDFA"") to set a lower price floor had the effect of 
increasing the potential number of mutually beneficial transactions between milk buyers and sellers. Under Cel-Tech 
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Company, 20 Cal. 4th 163, 186, 973 P.2d 527 (1999), plaintiffs must 
""tether"" their allegations of unfairness to competitors under section 17200 ""to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some 
actual or threatened impact on competition."" They failed to do so, and their unfair competition claim cannot survive."
716,2," Because plaintiffs failed to allege any anti-competitive effects of defendants' conduct, I do not address defendants' arguments 
on the ""filed-rate doctrine"" (discussed in part V.D. of the majority's opinion) and the Commerce Clause (discussed in part V.E.). "
717,3," Contrary to the majority's statement that the plaintiffs sought leave to amend unless the court determined no possible 
amendment would cure the complaint's deficiencies[,]"" plaintiffs actually requested leave to amend ""to determine if they can 
allege facts sufficient to meet the applicable legal standard set forth by this Court."" This may seem a minor distinction, but to the 
extent the majority seeks to divine from the district court's silence just what the court intended in granting defendants' motion to 
dismiss, it is necessary to state accurately what plaintiffs sought if, as happened, the district court granted defendants' motion. 
The majority errs here. The plaintiffs wanted a chance to amend if the district court granted the motion. By granting the motion, 
the district court implicitly acknowledged plaintiffs' request, particularly given the absence of a statement that a separate 
judgment would be entered or otherwise ending the case. "
718,4," ""The general authority of the Director of Agriculture to fix minimum prices under the Milk Control Act . . . has been considered

Vogel v. American Society of Appraisers, 744 F.2d 598, 601 (7th Cir. 1984). "
723,9," The supra-competitive price maintained by the price supports would restrain milk producers from selling milk to willing buyers at 
prices that still would be above marginal cost. The lowering of that supra-competitive price would permit those transactions,

not come into play when they would prohibit an action that a regulatory scheme permits."") Strobl, 768 F.2d at 27. "
742,6," ""Through such stabilizing operations, the manager sought to prevent any securities, which had been sold by dealers, from 
coming back into the market in such a manner as to depress the public offering price. It was felt that with respect to the 
securities which appeared in the market, the members of the selling syndicate had not performed their function of 'placing' with 
investors, for which they were paid a selling commission; and, consequently, 'repurchase penalties' were provided for, whereby 
the manager had the right to cancel the selling commission on the sale of those securities which he purchased in the market at 
or below the public offering price. Under most agreements, the manager had the option of either cancelling the selling 
commission on the sale of the securities, or of requiring the member who sold the securities to take them up at their cost to the 
trading accountโฆ Stabilizing operations and the repurchase penalty were used in all of the three types of selling syndicates

evidence of new unlawful practices by defendants."
742,8," Morgan cited the testimony of one industry witness, Harold L. Stuart, who testified that ""'you simply had to have such a clause

are fictitious 'wash' sales; 'matched' orders, or orders for the purchase and sale of the same security emanating from a common 
source for the purpose of recording operations on the tape and thereby creating a false appearance of activity; and other

in this suit, providing further evidence of its continued sanction."
748,20," We note, however, that plaintiffs' alleged antitrust injury is dubious. Plaintiffs claim that they were injured because they 
overpaid for the offering shares. This Court cannot find an injury because it sees no overpayment--plaintiffs bought their shares 
at the same price as the institutional investors and were free to sell them in the aftermarket without legal restriction. This claim is 
rendered even less compelling because plaintiffs, unlike the public at large, purchased the shares at the offering price, a price 
generally set below the shares' estimated market value."
748,21," Plaintiffs have been given ample opportunity to cure their pleadings. After defendants moved to dismiss in November 1998, 
plaintiffs amended their complaint. In amending their complaint, plaintiffs had the benefit of analyzing defendants' memorandum

granted and we see no way in which they can cure their claim through re-pleading. "

According to the defendants, by filing the first ANDA on Abbott's patents, Geneva precluded Zenith from introducing the first 
generic version of Hytrin. (E.g., Abbott Statement, Mar. 20, 2000, at 14.) This statement draws a legal conclusion and conflicts

774,1," The Commission's action in this case appears anomalous when juxtaposed to other government efforts respecting tobacco 
sales in the United States. In recent years, the government made every effort to stem the consumption of tobacco by the public. 
The government specifically has sought to discourage consumption by increasing the prices of tobacco products through taxes, 
regulating tobacco advertising, and decreasing the amount of shelf space devoted to tobacco products at stores. Here, by 
contrast, the FTC has vigorously and successfully opposed an acquisition of a chewing tobacco product on the basis that it will 
result in anticompetitive effects and price increases. This effort by the government therefore appears to be incoherent with its 
other efforts respecting tobacco. At the same time, the Court appreciates the Commission's explanation that if the acquisition is 
permitted then consumption of loose leaf will not decline. Rather, consumers will simply be paying more for that consumption. 
And even if the defendants were correct on their arguments that significant substitution would result, consumption would merely 
switch from loose leaf to moist snuff. Thus, there is ultimately no public health benefit to permitting the acquisition."
774,2," Swedish Match AB produces loose leaf tobacco, moist snuff tobacco, cigars, pipe tobacco, matches, and disposable lighters. In 
1999, the parent company had sales totaling approximately $ 1 billion in 140 countries. "
775,3," The Court particularly notes with respect to this fact that nothing in the holding today affects the parties' ability to proceed with 
their original joint manufacturing arrangement, should they wish to reconsider it. "
778,4," A 1996 ICR Loose Leaf Chewing Tobacco Attitude and Usage Study measured dual usage at thirty-seven percent. See DX 
807. Another study of 1509 respondents conducted by Rose Research in 1999 reported that forty-four percent of the 
respondents who claimed to be loose leaf users also used moist snuff. See DX 214. Together, these studies evidence the 
increase of dual usage in recent years. This is particularly compelling in light of the fact that an even greater percentage of 
younger users of loose leaf also use moist snuff. The 1999 Rose Research study showed that eighty-one percent of the loose 
leaf users ages eighteen to thirty-four reported also consuming moist snuff. See id. at 872. Sixty-three percent of the same age 
group reported using moist snuff most often. See id. at 873. The 1996 ICR study found that sixty-four percent of users ages 
eighteen to thirty-four were dual users. See DX 807 at 70. The Commission contests these studies as inaccurate because of the 
methodology used to obtain the data. It specifically contends that the percentages generated by the surveys depended in great 
measure upon the question asked, and in the survey relied upon by the defendants, the question that yielded forty-four percent 
dual usage is equivocal. Nonetheless, the Commission does not dispute that some amount of dual usage exists. As is discussed 
more fully below, it argues instead that the dual usage is irrelevant for determining price-based substitution. "
779,5," In Staples, the FTC showed that office supply superstores such as Staples set prices thirteen percent higher on average in 
markets that had no other office supply superstores. "
780,6," This result is confirmed by a 1999 Swedish Match promotion strategy analysis. The analysis approximated that the company 
would lose thirteen percent of its loose leaf sales if it increased price by eight percent. That approximation is equivalent to Dr. 
Simpson's estimated eight percent sales loss for a five percent price increase."
780,7," The Court is sensitive to the fact that the particular facts and materials of this case may not be amenable to fashioning an 
accurate economic prism through which one can view the exact outlines of the relevant product market in this case."
780,8," Despite these technical problems with Dr. Simpson's analysis, however, it does appear implausible that loose leaf users will 
substitute premium moist snuff in response to a ten-cent increase in price of premium loose leaf, because premium moist snuff 
would still be approximately $ 1.40 to 1.45 more expensive. And substitution by loose leaf users to price-value snuff likely would 
not be a significant constraint not only because price-value volume is small (price-value moist snuff only constitutes 
approximately 10% of moist snuff sold overall), but also because approximately 78% of price-value moist snuff is sold by loose 
leaf firms. In other words, it cannot be unprofitable for the hypothetical monopolist to raise the price under such circumstances 
because the monopolist would only lose a small amount of business in general, and of the lost amount most of it would be 
coming back because consumers would be substituting one of monopolist's products for another."
780,9," In his July 28 report, Dr. Train based his estimates upon a model of demand for loose leaf tobacco that includes as explanatory 
variables the price of loose leaf tobacco, the price of moist snuff, expenditures on smokeless tobacco, region specific effects, "
781,," and time specific effects. But as Dr. Train conceded, his estimate of elasticity depended on the order in which the data from 
different regions, used as instrumental variables, appears in his data base. Other orderings of the data lead to substantially 
different estimates of the elasticity. In his August 15 report, Dr. Train presented a new elasticity estimate based on a model that 
includes a lagged dependent variable (quantity sold from the previous period) as an additional explanatory variable and used a 
new method of implementing Dr. Train's instrumental variables calculation. In September, Dr. Train submitted yet another 
estimate of the elasticity for loose leaf after running more regressions."
781,10," While it may be true that there is no bright line between an eighty-five percent statistical significance level and more typically 
accepted levels of confidence such as ninety-five percent, the defendants have simply not convinced the Court in the totality of 
the circumstances of this case, which includes Dr. Train's inconsistencies, that it would be appropriate to accept conclusions at 
this lesser level of confidence. The Court will accordingly refuse their invitation to do so in this case. "
785,11," As a more accurate measure of market concentration, economists have created and courts have consistently relied upon the 
HHI. The HHI calculates market power summing the squares of the individual market shares of all the firms in the market. The 
HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market, increasing both as the number of firms in the 
market decreases and as the disparity in size among those firms increases. It has been officially adopted by the government in 
the Merger Guidelines to measure market concentration. Under the Merger Guidelines, a market with an HHI of less than 1000 
is ""unconcentrated."" An HHI between 1000 and 1800 indicates a ""moderately concentrated"" market, and any market with an HHI 
over 1800 qualifies as ""highly concentrated."" See FTC v. PPG Indus., Inc., 255 U.S. App. D.C. 69, 798 F.2d 1500, 1503 (D.C. 
Cir. 1986) (citing the Merger Guidelines). Further, according to the Merger Guidelines, unless mitigated by other factors which 
lead to the conclusion that the merger is not likely to lessen competition, an increase in the HHI is excess of 50 points in a post-
merger highly concentrated market may raise significant competitive concerns. In cases where the post-merger HHI is less than 
1,800, but greater than 1,000, the Merger Guidelines presume that a 100 point increase in the HHI is evidence that the merger 
will create or enhance market power."
785,12," The Merger Guidelines are not binding on the Court, but as this Circuit has stated, they do provide ""a useful illustration of the 
application of the HHI."" 798 F.2d at 1503 n. 4. "
786,13," All of this results in coordinated pricing. The defendants' own expert, Dr. Wu, has testified that these margins are set by taking 
account of the reactions of rivals--that is, by coordinating prices out of fear of retaliation for price cuts. Swedish Match has 
typically taken the lead in increasing prices of loose, with the other loose leaf producers following its lead, a pattern which has 
prevailed since at least 1996. For these reasons, the merger will only increase the likelihood of coordinated action because it 
creates a duopoly, the monitoring of prices is easy, and firms can punish price cutters. "

809,1," The plaintiff and defendant disagree over whether or not ACA's Board of Directors involves itself in membership decisions. ACA

conspire to deny it membership. Moreover, NCA did not object to defendant's stipulation that ""ACA's Board and Executive 
Committee were not consulted"" with respect to the second denial on May 11, 1999. The factual dispute is therefore limited to the 
first denial in 1995. "

the Supreme Court has more recently limited these cases by emphasizing that they involve boycotts which ""often cut off access

the relevant market."" Northwest, 472 U.S. at 294. "
825,1," Since this case is before the Court on Motions to Dismiss, the factual background is taken from the allegations contained in

829,6," In Brunswick, the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant had violated ยง 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18, which prohibits 
anti-competitive mergers, by purchasing a bowling alley with which the plaintiff was in competition and which would have gone 
out of business if the defendant had not purchased it. Since the defendant's transaction fostered rather than restrained 
competition, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff had not, as a result, suffered an antitrust injury."
829,7," In Atlantic Richfield, the plaintiff, an independent retailer of gasoline, alleged that defendant, an integrated marketer of 
petroleum products, had violated ยง 1 of the Sherman Act, by engaging in a vertical conspiracy with its dealers to set maximum 
retail prices for gasoline at below-market levels. (""Predatory pricing may be defined as pricing below an appropriate measure of 
cost for the purpose of eliminating competitors in the short run and reducing competition in the long run."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort 
of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 117, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986)). Since the alleged conspiracy fostered competition 
by reducing the price of gasoline to consumers (the defendant was alleged to have conspired with its dealers to set a maximum 
price for gasoline, i.e., a ceiling or price above which its dealers were not permitted to charge consumers, which had caused the 
plaintiff to reduce the price that it charged consumers, thus injuring the plaintiff by preventing it from charging higher prices), the 
Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff had not suffered an antitrust injury. "
830,8," A franchise could be located in the Dayton area by purchasing an existing franchise and moving it to the area. Anyone wishing 
to purchase a Midwest League franchise would initially be required to obtain approval from that League, by filing a Control 
Interest Transfer Application (""CIT""). If the Midwest League approved the CIT, the prospective purchaser would then have to 
obtain approval from the NAPBL and Major League Baseball (""MLB""). Having secured all three levels of approval to purchase 
the franchise, the purchaser would then have to file an Application for Relocation (""AFR"") with the Midwest League and, if the 
League gave its blessing, the approval process with the NAPBL and MLB would need to be repeated. In addition, since the 
Dayton area is within the protected territory of Defendant Cincinnati Reds (""Reds""), the purchaser who wished to transfer a 
franchise to that area would also be required to obtain a territorial waiver from that entity. "
833,9," Defendants suggest that Plaintiff would not have brought this action had Dr. Nilavar been a member of the group which was 
awarded the exclusive contract. Although this may, in fact, be the case, the Court must focus on the Complaint, accepting the 
factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. With that standard in mind, Plaintiff has 
complained of the negative effect that the contract has on competition as a whole in the Springfield-Urbana area. The Court, 
therefore, cannot conclude that Plaintiff's discontent with the exclusive contract is solely based on the fact that it was awarded to 
DIA rather than to him. "

839,13," Paragraph 10.d. also provides that if the representatives are not able to agree upon the allocation within thirty days, they shall

839,14," Plaintiff argues that the district court in Jefferson Parish concluded that the hospital used ""global billing"" and the percentage 
retained by the hospital was reasonably related to the services it provided, yet the tying claim was not dismissed for lack of a 
direct economic benefit. As noted by the Beard court, the Supreme Court did not address the direct economic benefit 
requirement in its Jefferson Parish decision. Likewise, the Jefferson Parish district court did not address that requirement. 
Accordingly, this Court does not find that the lack of analysis regarding whether the hospital received a direct economic benefit 
in Jefferson Parish requires the conclusion that an equitable unitary fee constitutes such a benefit, particularly in light of Sixth 
Circuit precedent. "
840,15," Dr. Osborn and DIA do not argue that Plaintiff's federal antitrust claims are subject to claim preclusion. Because the Court has 
concluded, supra, that Plaintiff has stated a state law antitrust claim for contract in restraint of trade but not a state law illegal 
tying arrangement claim, Plaintiff's claim preclusion argument is pertinent to the contract in restraint of trade portion of Count 
Three and is moot regarding the tying arrangement claim. However, the Court's claim preclusion analysis also provides an 
alternate basis for dismissing the state law tying arrangement claim. "

844,18," In summary, DIA and Osborn may not be considered co-conspirators, because Plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim against them 
must be dismissed under the doctrine of claim preclusion. Maki, Peterson, and MHS-WO are considered one entity, pursuant to 
the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine. Under Copperweld, MHS-WO and CHP are also considered one entity. Although DIA and 
Osborn may not be considered co-conspirators for purposes of civil conspiracy and state law antitrust claims, they may still 
constitute co-conspirators for the federal antitrust claim, because that claim remains a viable claim against them. "
847,19," In their reply memorandum, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not alleged that the alleged deprivation of due process and the 
alleged breach of contract caused him injury, because Plaintiff states that his claim is not for wrongful termination of his 
privileges. Construing Plaintiff's arguments in the light most favorable to him, he appears to argue that he was entitled to notice 
and hearing and that, with such a hearing, the hospitals may have decided to retain his privileges. The Court construes his 
""concessions"" as stating that the contract permits termination of privileges, if done so in accordance with the Manual (Doc. # 18 
at 42, 47). Accordingly, the Court does not read Plaintiff's opposition memorandum as conceding that he cannot establish 
causation or damages for purposes of his due process and breach of contract claims. "

INQUIRER, Jan. 9, 1998, available at LEXIS, News Library, Philadelphia Inquirer File. Plaintiffs had ample time to research 
possible individual plaintiffs for the lawsuit, but evidently chose not to add them as plaintiffs. In any event, it is difficult to see how 
resolution of the present case would preclude possible future claims by individuals against appropriate individual defendants. 
See CoreStates Bank, N.A. v. Huls America, Inc., 176 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 1999) (requiring participation of the same parties or 
their privies for application of claim preclusion). "
878,12," I retain jurisdiction over the City's claims for public nuisance or negligence. Above, I rejected the City's constitutional 
challenge, in part, because they had no accrued causes of action. See supra section I.C.2. I now explain why there is no 
nuisance or negligence claim against the defendants. "
879,13," While the degree of harm which the plaintiffs allege weighs toward imposing the duty, this factor may be outweighed by the 
lack of foreseeability of that harm. Althaus, 756 A.2d at 1166. Therefore, the court will concentrate its analysis on the 
foreseeability component of this factor. "
882,14," Ostensibly, proximate cause would also limit the plaintiffs' recovery on their public nuisance claim, even if the question would 
not be one of law for the court. See Fairbanks v. Kerr & Smith, 70 Pa. 86 (1872) (requiring submission to jury of proximate cause 
element for public nuisance claim); Allegheny v. Zimmerman, 95 Pa. 287 (1880). Federal courts have also required causation in

proximate cause."" Allegheny Gen. Hosp. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 228 F.3d 429, 446 (3d Cir. 2000). As the Third Circuit has recently 
spoken on this issue in Allegheny General Hospital, the court will not revisit it here. "
883,15," The Third Circuit also conducted remoteness inquiry under Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d

884,16," Even if specific intent were not a factor for proximate cause analysis in negligence claims, the other five factors strongly weigh

the Attorney General to sue on behalf of Pennsylvania. See Commonwealth v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 736 A.2d 693, 693-94 (Pa. 
Commw. Ct. 1999) (Kelley, J. dissenting). "
887,4," At oral argument, plaintiffs pointed to the Third Circuit's recent decision for implicit recognition that the design and marketing of 
a product - tobacco - could constitute a public nuisance. See Allegheny Gen. Hosp. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 228 F.3d 429, 446 (3d 
Cir. 2000). The Third Circuit held nothing of the kind, and it did not even discuss the issue. See id. at 446. Rather, it precluded 
recovery by declining to find the plaintiff hospitals has suffered harm different from that of other members of society. See id. "
889,5," One U.S. district court in Ohio deferred dismissal of a public nuisance claim brought by the City of Cleveland against the gun 
industry, finding the issue turned on whether or not the defendants had been negligent. See White v. Smith & Wesson, Corp., 97 
F. Supp. 2d 816, 829 (N.D. Ohio 2000). The federal district court issued its opinion on March 14, 2000, and did not have the

934,7," In Eleven Line, Inc. v. North Texas State Soccer Ass., Inc., 213 F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 2000), the Fifth Circuit declined to endorse 
and did not rule on the district court's application of a ยง 2 ""monopolistic leveraging"" theory of liability. Id. at 206, n. 16. The court 
noted that this theory is the subject of a circuit split. Id. Because this court finds in the present case that Plaintiff has failed to prove that North Oaks has market power of inpatient 
hospital services, the court need not further consider a ยง 2 ""monopolistic leveraging"" theory of liability. Like the Fifth Circuit in 
Eleven Line, this court notes the issue of whether or not there is a ยง ""monopolistic leveraging"" theory of liability but preserves 
this issue for a future day. The court also notes that even if the court found that Plaintiff proved its Sherman ยง 2 claim against North Oaks, North Oaks 
would nevertheless be immune from paying money damages pursuant to the Local Government Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C, ยง 34-36. "
935,8," In its Post-Trial Memorandum, Plaintiff argues that ""North Oaks targets all of its marketing efforts in Tangipahoa Parish."" 
(Memo. at 4). However, as this court repeatedly stated during the Trial of this matter, what North Oaks perceives as its service 
area is not equivalent to the geographic service area for antitrust purposes. Even Plaintiff's antitrust expert, Dr. Long, agreed that 
""the traditional provider notions of ""primary"" and ""secondary"" service areas are not necessarily consistent with geographic 
market definitions in economics."" (Long Report at 6)."

and a Proposed Approach,"" Socio-Economic Planning Science, (24)2, 1990, pp. 81-95. Dr Long reports that the Elzinga and 
Hogarty ""shipment"" approach is analogous to the patient origin approach. (Long Report at 6)."
935,10," See Long Report, Table 2, ยง B (attached hereto as Court's Addendum 1). The underlying source of Dr. Long's data was obtained from HCIA, Inc., a healthcare information service provider that tabulates 
this data for the State of Louisiana (among many other states)."
935,11," Dr Lynk, like Dr. Long, used information obtained from documents produced by North Oaks and prepared by HCIA, Inc. Dr. 
Lynk also explained that the year 1998 was the most recent year for which this data was available to him, and according to HCIA 
the years prior to 1998 were less complete in their hospital coverage than 1998 was. (Lynk Report at p. 28, n. 62). As the unit of measurement for inpatient hospital activity, Dr. Lynk used ""patient days"" and Dr. Long used ""patient admissions"". 
However, both Dr. Lynk and Dr. Long agreed that the difference was not material. (Lynk TR. 14; Long TR. 118). Dr. Lynk ""did not see any obvious rationale for excluding"" indigent patients, and further testified that because North Oaks ""admits 
patients that they anticipate not providing payment,"" he is ""not positive that their exclusion is warranted."" (Lynk TR. 32). 
Nevertheless, Dr. Lynk he testified that excluding them would result in a ""very immaterial adjustment"" to his ultimate market 
share determination. (Lynk TR. 32-33). On the other hand, Dr. Long opined that it was proper to exclude the medically indigent from the pool of patients for which the 
parties might compete, and thus he modified his definition of the product market to persons ineligible for free care provided by 
the State of Louisiana's Charity Hospital System (CHS). Nevertheless, with regard to Lallie Kemp (a CHS hospital physically 
proximate to the parties), Dr. Long testified that excluding these indigent patients did not make a material difference in his 
conclusions. (Long TR. 95). Similarly, Dr. Long reported that the split between charity and non-charity patients at Earl K. Long 
Hospital (another hospital in the CHS system located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana) had no significant effect on his market 
analysis, and thus all of its patients were assumed to be non-charity. (Long Report, p. 3, n. 1). "

the east into Washington Parish and St. Tammany Parish, and they account for 90.71% of inpatient days and 90.50% of 
inpatient admissions at North Oaks."
936,14," Dr. Lynk testified that the FTC has found no empirical study to support a preference of 75% or 90%. (Lynk TR. 89-90). 
However, Dr. Lynk noted in his report that: A Justice Department official, discussing the use of the Elzinga-Hogarty test in merger applications, notes on this issue that

within North Oaks' service area, only about half of them (50,588 or 50.90%) are for hospitalization in Hammond at North Oaks). 
Lynk Table 4 is attached hereto as Court's Addendum 4."
938,19," Lynk Report, Table 3 (using a ""zip code area"" analysis). While Table 3 shows that 49.10% of the North Oaks' service area 
patients go to other hospitals in Louisiana, Table 3 does not identify which city or hospital these patients out-migrate to. Lynk 
Table 3 is attached hereto as Court's Addendum 3."
938,20," Lynk Report, Table 4. This is analogous to and symmetric with the 90% inclusion criterion used in step one to construct the 
North Oaks service area."
938,21," See Lynk Report, Table 5 for a listing of these nineteen hospitals, one of which is North Oaks."
938,22," In his out-migration analysis, Dr. Lynk did not exclude indigent patients. While Dr. Lynk testified that excluding indigent 
patients would result in an immaterial adjustment in his ultimate calculation of market share (Lynk Table 5; Lynk TR. 32-33), the 
court cannot determine from the record whether exclusion of indigent patients would have materially adjusted his initial out-
migration results set forth in his Table 3 and Table 4."
938,23," Lynk Report, Table 5 (attached hereto as Court's Addendum 5). "
939,24," If Dr. Lynk had used ""zip code areas,"" a more precise and accurate measurement than ""cities,"" to determine out-migration of 
patients from North Oaks' service area, the quandary of whether or not Ochsner Foundation Hospital and the city of New 
Orleans should be included in defining the relevant geographic market would have been eliminated. Indeed, the use of zip code areas (as the more concise building blocks) would have allowed one to determine incremental 
additurs to the relevant geographic market and thus the boundaries of the relevant geographic market could be defined with 
more precision."
939,25," As Dr. Lynk explained, Hood failed to report its data to HCIA, so its data was ""flat-out missing"" from the overall data file. (Lynk 
TR. 93-93)."
939,26," See William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, ""Market Power in Antitrust Cases,"" 94 Harvard L. Rev. 937, 963 (1981) (""If a 
distant seller has some sales in a local market, all its sales, wherever made, should be considered part of that local market for 
purposes of computing the market share of the local seller.""); see also Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320,

940,28," Lynk Report, Table 5 (attached hereto as Court's Addendum 5). North Oaks' patient days (55,768) / Total patient days at 19 
hospitals (1,035,545) = 5.39%."
940,29," Another example indicating that Dr. Lynk's Step Three was not an exact science is his inclusion of two other hospitals in New 
Orleans: Jo Ellen Smith Hospital, a psychiatric hospital; and Children's Hospital, a highly specialized hospital for the treatment of 
children. While Dr. Lynk's analysis included admissions limited to those with North Oaks DRG's, the inclusion of these two 
specialty hospitals in the denominator of Dr. Lynk's market share formula raises a red flag. Still another example of the inexactitude of Dr. Lynk's Step Three analysis is his inclusion of indigent patients. With regard to the 
Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans (""Big Charity""), Dr. Lynk testified that there were 52.8% of ""no-pay or charity 
patients"" and that if he excluded them, North Oaks' market share would only rise from 5.39% to 6.14%. (Lynk TR. 34). However, 
Dr. Lynk also included indigent patients from Earl K. Long and Lallie Kemp, which as CHS hospitals, have a substantial 
percentage of indigent patients. When coupled with the inclusion of Ochsner, Jo Ellen Smith and Children's Hospital, the 
inclusion of these indigent patients in the denominator of Dr. Lynk's market share formula becomes at least facially troublesome."
940,30," Covington, Louisiana is approximately 25 miles east of Hammond, Louisiana, and both are north of Lake Ponchartrain."
940,31," Covington's hospitals (St. Tammany and Lakeview) had a total of 54,314 days, compared to North Oaks' patient days of 
55,768; thus, 54,314/55,768 = 97.39%. (Lynk Table 5, attached hereto as Court's Addendum 5). Covington's hospitals had a total of 14,170 admissions, compared to North Oaks' admissions of 10,387; thus, 14,170/10,387 = 
136.42%. (Lynk Table 5, attached hereto as Court's Addendum 5). "

future. "
942,34," Defendant's anti-trust expert, William J. Lynk, Ph.D., also reported and testified that monopolization of the outpatient market is 
unattainable."
942,35," In FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S.447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), the Court found that a dental 
association rule forbidding members to submit x-rays to dental insurers in connection with claims forms constituted an 
unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sherman Act ยง 1. In its ruling, the Court stated: Since the purpose of the inquiries into market definition and market power is to determine whether an arrangement has the 
potential for genuine adverse effects on competition, ""proof of actual detrimental effects, such as reduction of output,"" can 
obviate the need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a ""surrogate for detrimental effects."""
942,106," S. Ct. at 2019, quoting 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1511, p. 429 (1986). And then the Court concluded that: the finding of actual, sustained adverse effect on competition . . . is legally sufficient to support a finding that the challenged 
restraint was unreasonable even in the absence of elaborate market analysis."
942,106," S. Ct. at 2019. In Great Western Directories, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 63 F.3d 1378, 1384 (5th Circuit 1995), the court cited 
FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists for the proposition that ""proof of actual detrimental effects can obviate the need for the 
inquiry into market power."" However, that decision was reversed in part by Great Western Directories, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell 
Telephone Co., 74 F.3d 613 (5th Cir. 1996), which in turn was vacated pursuant to settlement. "

misconduct. LSA-R.S. 9:2798.1(C). The court finds that these exceptions to the immunity provision do not apply here."
944,38," The Louisiana antitrust statutes are essentially copies of the federal antitrust statutes, and thus they are generally interpreted 
in the same manner as the federal antitrust laws. However, there is some question as to whether the Louisiana antitrust laws 
apply only to intrastate commerce, and not to interstate commerce (which is involved in this case). In Free v. Abbott 
Laboratories, Inc., the Fifth Circuit certified this question to the Louisiana Supreme. 164 F.3d 270, 277 (5th Cir. 1999). However, 
the Louisiana Supreme Court denied certification. 739 So. 2d 216 (La. 1999). When the case ultimately made its way back to the Fifth Circuit, the court ""assumed arguendo that Louisiana antitrust laws apply 
to a conspiracy carried on interstate that has effects within the state. But see HMC Management Corp. v New Orleans

evidence showing that Continental employees are given discretion and are encouraged to allow larger and more bags onboard 
where appropriate, and that Continental's baggage policies have received positive publicity in the marketplace. Indeed, it is 
similarly undisputed that Continental's tariff also states that ""the suitability of baggage as to weight, size, and character to be 
carried in the passenger compartment will be determined by Continental,"" and that ""Continental reserves the right in its sole and 
absolute discretion to determine the suitability and place of storage of any item to be carried in the cabin of the aircraft."" Thus,

at 781. The challenged rule restricted member dentists to advertising that was not ""false or misleading in any material respect."" 
Id. The Supreme Court concluded that it was not prima facie obvious that the rule would have any effect at all on competition, let 
alone a negative one. The professional context within which the restraint operated rendered plausible the association's argument 
that the restraint would in fact promote competition by eliminating misleading advertising. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, too quickly 
presumed that the restraint would have anticompetitive effects and too quickly shifted the burden to the association to offer 
procompetitive justifications for the restraint. See id. at 775--77. On remand, the Ninth Circuit sustained the restraint under a full

966,35," Although courts subjecting restraints to Section 1 scrutiny generally recognize three modes of Rule of Reason analysis, this is 
not to say that the lines of demarcation separating them are rigid and certain; rather, as one respected commentator has 
observed, the three modes are probably more accurately viewed as existing on an analytical continuum, with the requisite 
degree of scrutiny and market analysis varying as required by the nature of the restraint. See XI Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust 
Law P 1911, p. 266 (1998) (""The amount and range of information needed to make a conclusion of unreasonableness, or 
illegality, cannot be pigeon-holed into two forms of inquiry, per se and rule of reason. But neither can it readily be pigeon-holed 
into three. At the two extremes the domain of the inquiry is easily stated: under the per se rule power, intent, effect, and most 
defenses are irrelevant; under the rule of reason all are essential. But in the middle area differing amounts and types of 
information may be necessary to enable a court to make a judgment of reasonableness. For highly suspicious but somewhat 
unique restraints, perhaps an examination and rejection of proffered defenses will be sufficient. For somewhat less suspicious 
restraints, no judgment of effects can be made without some inquiry into market structure or power.""). "
967,36," Nor is there any doubt that carry-on baggage policy is an element of competition that is important to many consumers. 
Although defendants attempt to quibble with this fact by grudgingly conceding that carriers compete at some level on carry-on 
baggage policies, but arguing that such policies are ""a trivially small aspect of airline competition,"" the record unambiguously 
discloses that airline carry-on policy is not an insignificant aspect of airline competition. Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' 
Statement of Undisputed Facts, No. 10, at 5. Indeed, it is beyond dispute that United was aware that carry-on policy is an 
important element of competition among airlines, as the record contains evidence of (i) United's analysis of its Des Moines 
experiment, which predicted market share loss were passengers limited to one carry-on bag and other competitors did not follow 
suit; (ii) United's experience with baggage templates at several hubs, where United saw ""resistance from key customers"" and 
received threats from customers to fly on other airlines instead, PX 59; (iii) United's conclusion that ""UA [was] at [a] competitive 
disadvantage for onboard carry-on storage due to competitors operating MD80 and B757 with an extra closet,"" PX 69 at 1881; 
and (iv) United's admission that the justification for lobbying the FAA to impose an industry standard for carry-on baggage size 
was to ""discard carry-on baggage as a competitive advantage or disadvantage,"" to ""level[] [a] competitive problem for UA,"" and 
""to level the playing field for carry-on baggage,"" PX 60 at 1; PX 58 at 4476; PX 56 at 4704; PX 596."
967,37," As the record reflects, defendants installed carry-on baggage templates at Dulles security checkpoints to prevent passengers 
of all carriers at the airport from passing through security checkpoints with carry-on bags exceeding defendants' agreed 
standardized size. The primary effect of the restriction, therefore, is to standardize the size of bags that passengers may carry 
onto the aircraft at Dulles. This, in turn, prevents carriers such as Continental from offering passengers (i) the ability to carry onto 
Continental aircraft larger bags, or (ii) a flexible carry-on baggage policy that would allow their bags either to be carried onto the 
aircraft when circumstances particular to individual flights permit or to be checked planeside or at the gate--thereby at least 
allowing passengers to avoid the inconvenience of being processed at the main terminal ticket counter."

competition might occur. In the most threatening circumstances, such as naked price fixing, the consequences of this loss of 
competition are immediate and obvious. But the harmful results can be present even in circumstances that appear quite benign. 
For example, a product or format standardization agreement among makers of high-definition television or videotapes may 
enable participants to develop a more secure market for their product; but once such an agreement is put in place it also "
968,," increases significantly the costs to any firm of trying to innovate alternatives to the product that is the subject of the agreement. 
Thus the result may be not only reduced production and development costs, but also reduced incentives toward further

demand for their product will fall, so the amount supplied will fall too--in other words, output will be restricted. If instead the firms

relevant here, raising price, reducing output, and dividing markets have the same anticompetitive effects""); Robert H. Bork, The

limitation on output[,] . . . our cases have held that such limitations are unreasonable restraints of trade""). As the Supreme Court 
has taught, a ""horizontal . . . output limitation [is] ordinarily condemned as a matter of law under an 'illegal per se approach 
because the probability that these practices are anticompetitive is so high,"" and ""in such circumstances a restraint is presumed 
unreasonable without inquiry into the particular market in which it is found."" Id. at 100. ""The likelihood that horizontal . . . output

969,43," Even were the anticompetitive effect of defendants' agreement not so obvious, plaintiffs have clearly offered proof of 
anticompetitive effects. It is well-settled that HN8[
] because ""the purpose of the inquiries into market definition and market 
power is to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition, 'proof of actual 
detrimental effects, such as reduction of output' can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 'surrogate 
for detrimental effects.'"" FTC v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009--61 (1986) 
(quoting 7 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1511, p. 429 (1986)). In this regard, actual anticompetitive effects may be 
manifested in the form of a ""reduction of output, increase in price, or deterioration in quality of goods or services."" United States 
v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 668 (3d Cir. 1993). Here, the record discloses that because defendants' carry-on baggage size 
restriction has effectively eliminated competition on this basis, it has reduced product diversity, discouraged product innovation, 
and restricted the ability of competing airlines to offer better carry-on baggage policies, which is a form of output for carriers. As 
a result, the quality of airline service at Dulles has deteriorated, as defendants' restraint prevents passengers from taking 
advantage of baggage-friendly policies that would otherwise be offered at least by Continental and perhaps by other airlines at 
Dulles."
969,44," Indeed, the circumstances of this case are analogous, if not identical, to those in FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 
U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986). At issue there was an agreement among the members of a dentists' trade 
association to withhold x-rays requested by insurers to evaluate claims for benefits. The Supreme Court recognized that the 
agreement was an obvious horizontal restraint on output of a service desired by insurers and patients, and hence it was 
unnecessary to analyze the relevant product and geographic markets before requiring the association to come forward with 
procompetitive justifications, for, ""'as a matter of law, the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction on "
970,," price or output,' and such a restriction 'requires some competitive justification even in the absence of a detailed market 
analysis.'"" Id. at 460 (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 109--10). There, as here, the restraint ""takes the form of a horizontal 
agreement among [competitors] to withhold from their customers a particular service that they desire,"" and ""'while this is not 
price fixing as such, no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of such an 
agreement.'"" 476 U.S. at 459 (quoting National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs, 435 U.S. at 692). In such a case, the agreement ""may still 
survive scrutiny under section 1 if the procompetitive benefits of the restraint justify the anticompetitive effects,"" Law, 134 F.3d 
1010, 1021 (10th Cir. 1998), but absent some countervailing procompetitive virtue--such as, for example, the creation of efficiencies in the operation of a 
market or the provision of goods and services--such an agreement limiting consumer choice by impeding the 'ordinary give 
and take of the marketplace' cannot be sustained under the Rule of Reason. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 459 (citations omitted and quoting National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs, 435 U.S. at 692)."
970,45," Plaintiffs take issue with defendants' assertion that the record contains evidence that templates reduced delays attributable to 
carry-on baggage ""up to 72% in Chicago"" as comparing only one week of pre-template date with the singe most favorable data 
point after templates were installed at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Applying this same analytical method to Dulles, 
plaintiffs argue, discloses that carry-on templates increased gate-checked delays up to 200% in 1999 and 8.3% in 2000. In this 
regard, plaintiffs contend that the effect templates had on reducing delays is unmeasurable. Indeed, plaintiffs point out that on-
time departure data at airports with templates is no better than that at airports without templates. See PX 310 at 9 (United States 
Department of Transportation ""Air Travel Consumer Report"" for September 2000 disclosing that only 54.1% of flights departed 
on-time from Denver International Airport (a United hub with carry-on baggage templates installed), while 83.1% of flights 
departed on time from Houston (a Continental hub with no carry-on baggage templates installed)). "

1913, p. 303 (1998) (""The defendant is . . . entitled to show that the restraint in fact has 'redeeming virtues'--which is another 
way of saying that integration or a potential for efficiencies exists that tends to make the overall impact of the restraint 
procompetitive, or output increasing."")."
971,47," Unlike in CDA, for example, where information failure in the market for dental services justified a restriction on advertising 
intended to limit deceptive advertising, there is simply no failure in the market for airline carry-on baggage capacity and policies 
to justify defendants' agreement. See CDA, 119 S. Ct. at 1614-15 (""Assuming that the record in fact supports the conclusion that 
CDA disclosure rules essentially bar advertisement of across-the-board discounts, it does not obviously follow that such a ban 
would have a net anticompetitive effect here."")."

or process that the firms acting individually could not develop."")."
971,49," For example, while the record arguably contains some evidence that an excessive number of carry-on bags poses a safety 
risk to passengers and crew, such a risk exists only because the aircraft does not have adequate carry-on baggage storage 
capacity. Yet, there is no evidence in the record that individual airlines, in a competitive market, cannot provide sufficient storage 
capacity to meet passenger needs. Indeed, the FAA has rejected the imposition of a uniform carry-on bag size for all domestic 
carriers on the ground that ""safety is determined by the ability to stow every item properly, not by size or number alone."" Carry-
On Baggage Program, 52 Fed. Reg. 21,472, at 21,475. In this regard, the FAA recognized that ""while . . . a single [carry-on "
972,," baggage] standard has a certain appeal, a uniform standard for all air carriers and airplanes would necessarily have to be 
designed for the lowest common denominator (i.e., the smallest available stowage space, fleet-wide) and would therefore 
drastically and needlessly limit carry-on baggage."" Id. at 21,473 (emphasis added). Thus, the record discloses that defendants' 
agreement promotes onboard safety only insofar as it artificially restricts consumer demand for greater aircraft carry-on storage 
capacity and thereby alleviates any competitive pressure on airlines with inferior capacity to improve their services. There is 
otherwise no evidence that airlines cannot increase their carry-on storage capacity instead of interfering with the demand for this 
product. Similarly, there is no support in the record for the proposition that open competition in the market for air carriage service 
cannot produce the other results defendants seek to achieve through the elimination of competition--namely, improved on-time 
performance and increased passenger comfort and convenience. See infra note 52."
972,50," As discussed above, the output that airlines produce is composed of a various components, including nonquantitative, quality-
based components. It is, therefore, no defense for defendants to claim that the elimination of competition on one aspect of 
output promotes competition insofar as it increases another aspect of output. See Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law P 2023.1, p. 614 (Supp. 2000) (""Ordinarily a naked horizontal restraint is not saved from per se condemnation 
simply because it offers the possibility of higher output of the narrowly defined product itself. The 'output' of any firm is the 
combination of the product plus other services that the market produces. Thus the output of a car dealer is car transactions, its 
desirable showroom hours of operation, and its advertising. An agreement among dealers not to have showrooms reduces costs 
and may or may not result in greater car sales. But we attach significance to the fact that consumers value the showroom; 
otherwise the competitive market would not have produced it."")."
972,51," Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514--5 (1958); see National Soc'y of Prof'l 
Eng'rs, 435 U.S. at 695 (noting that the Sherman Act ""reflects a legislative judgment that ultimately competition will produce not 
only lower prices, but also better goods and services. . . . The assumption that competition is the best method of allocating 
resources in a free market recognizes that all elements of a bargain--quality, service, safety, and durability--and not just the 
immediate cost, are favorably affected by the free opportunity to select among alternative offers.""); Herbert Hovenkamp,

further innovation)."
972,52," Even under a full Rule of Reason analysis, defendants' proffered justifications are likely to fail, as the record discloses that 
airlines at Dulles have less-restrictive or anticompetitive alternatives available to achieve the goals of improved on-time 
performance, greater onboard safety, and increased passenger comfort and convenience. See, e.g., Bhan v. NME Hosps., Inc., 
929 F.2d 1404, 1413 (9th Cir. 1991); Kreuzer v. American Acad. of Periodontology, 237 U.S. App. D.C. 43, 735 F.2d 1479, 1495 
& 1496 n.25 (D.C. Cir. 1984); North Am. Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F.2d 1249, 1259, 1261 (2d Cir. 1982); Rosebrough 
Monument Co. v. Memorial Park Cemetery Assoc., 666 F.2d 1130, 1145--46 (8th Cir. 1981). Even assuming arguendo that a restriction on carry-on bag size is an acceptable way to achieve these goals, it is indisputable 
that defendants can implement such a restriction at Dulles without imposing it on non-consenting carriers and thereby "
973,," eliminating competition on carry-on baggage policies. Simply put, airlines wishing to restrict carry-on baggage size can install 
templates at their departure gates, where the restriction would impact only consenting airlines' passengers. Oversized bags 
screened there could then be checked at the gate or sent back to the main ticket counter. Moreover, Continental has offered--and defendants have not disputed--evidence of other, less-restrictive alternatives to 
achieving these goals without necessarily restricting carry-on bag size for all carriers. For example, carriers could improve gate-
checking procedures to facilitate smoother handling of carry-on bags too large to fit in aircraft storage bins. Or, airlines could 
station more personnel at gate areas to help customers with their bags. Still another option is to give passengers more time to 
board the aircraft and thereby to find storage space for their bags. In this regard, defendants' argument that the configuration of Dulles requires that carry-on templates be installed at the common 
security checkpoints loses persuasive weight. In short, defendants' restriction, even if effective to secure defendants some 
benefits, does so by unnecessarily restricting competition and therefore cannot survive Sectionl scrutiny."
973,53," Defendants correctly conceded at oral argument that they have no legitimate interest in limiting the size of carry-on bags that 
Continental allows its customers. Despite this concession, defendants expressed unwillingness to distribute an unlimited number 
of Medallions to Continental and cited concerns over disrupting the effectiveness of the current templates with regard to other 
carriers' passengers. The necessary inference from this is that the Medallion program does not accommodate all Continental 
passengers. Were the record to reflect that all Continental passengers could avoid the carry-on baggage size restriction without 
significant cost to Continental, defendants' antitrust injury argument might well have force. The current record does not so 
indicate. Should defendants have evidence of this nature, however, they may seek reconsideration of the ruling. "
974,54," In this regard, the practical effect of the Medallion program is to impose on all carriers at Dulles a carry-on baggage policy 
similar to United's ""Take-Off Fares"" program at Des Moines International Airport, in that the Medallion program effectively 
reallocates onboard carry-on storage space that would otherwise be provided to low-yield passengers to high-yield passengers. 
But, unlike the ""Take-Off Fares"" program, the central defect of which was the significant prospect for United passengers to 
switch to other less-restrictive airlines, the Medallion program forecloses similar market-share losses by imposing the restriction 
on all carriers at Dulles, thus leaving low-yield passengers with no choice at Dulles but to bow to the restriction."
974,55," Thus, defendants' argument that Continental cannot prove antitrust injury stemming from the loss of potential customers 
because, as defendants rhetorically put it, ""Why would a passenger switch airlines when the templates at Dulles apply equally to 
all carriers?"" proves too much. It is precisely because passengers would not switch airlines at Dulles by virtue of the mandated 
standardization of carry-on baggage policies that plaintiffs have suffered antitrust injury in the form of lost profits. It is the very 
fact that, in the words of Continental's expert, ""the market is not allowed to reward Continental to the extent that its liberal on-
plane baggage policy is a benefit to consumers,"" that Continental suffers injury to its business or property. PX 350 at 23."
974,56," Also unpersuasive is defendants' argument that plaintiffs have not offered proof of injury within the relevant geographic and 
product market. Given that the anticompetitive tendencies and effects of defendants' agreement are obvious and illegal under 
the Rule of Reason without examination of the relevant market, and that these effects were sustained by Continental at Dulles, 
no further examination of the relevant market is required to conclude that Continental has suffered antitrust injury. In this regard, defendants' reliance on Oksanen and Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 
104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984), is misplaced. In both cases, ""there [was] no evidence that competition as a whole in the relevant market 
has been harmed""--that is, the predicate violation of the Sherman Act had not been proven under the full Rule of Reason. 
Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 709; see Hyde, 466 U.S. at 31 (""There has been no showing that the market as a whole has been affected 
at all by the contract."") Accordingly, any injury sustained by the plaintiffs in those cases could not have flowed from injury to 
competition, and the plaintiffs, therefore, could not have suffered antitrust injury. See Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 707 (""The fact that a 
hospital's decision caused a disappointed physician to practice medicine elsewhere does not of itself constitute an antitrust 
injury.""). Here, however, an abbreviated Rule of Reason inquiry--one that does not involve an examination of the relevant 
market--is sufficient to prove the predicate violation of the Sherman Act. As long as plaintiffs prove that their injury flows from this 
predicated violation, they have proven the requisite antitrust injury. "
976,57," The proper gauge of the extent to which the state action doctrine applies varies with the nature of the entity invoking the 
doctrine. The cases cited by defendants to support their claim that foreseeability is the appropriate standard involve political 
subdivisions such as cities, counties, municipalities, and townships--all subordinate governmental entities--invoking the state 
action doctrine for acts that the entities themselves took. In Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, for example, the Supreme Court 
considered ""how clearly a state policy must be articulated for a municipality to be able to establish that its anticompetitive activity 
constitutes state action."" 471 U.S. 34, 40, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (emphasis added). At issue was a city's operation of 
the only local sewage treatment facility and refusal to provide service to nearby towns. See id. at 37. The Supreme Court found it 
""clear that anticompetitive effects logically would result from [the city's] broad authority to regulate"" the sewage facility and held 
the city's actions immune from antitrust attack.  Id. at 42. Similarly, in City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 
U.S. 365, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991), the state action doctrine shielded a municipality's anticompetitive restriction 
on the size of billboards despite the existence of only a broad grant of authority to regulate the use of land and the construction 
of buildings. On the other hand, Midcal and its progeny clearly establish that the governing standard for actions taken by private 
actors is whether ""the State's intent to establish an anticompetitive regulatory program is clear."" Southern Motor Carriers, 471 
U.S. at 64. Here, it is unnecessary to decide which of these standards apply, for the state-action doctrine is inapplicable under 
either standard."
976,58," Because defendants have failed to satisfy this first prong of the Midcal test, it is unnecessary to discuss whether they have 
satisfied the second, ""active supervision"" prong. "
992,1," Note, the tests for determining geographic market under ยงยง 3 and 7 of the Act are similar. Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 329; United

the rules of OSEG. Thus, the rules are meaningless without the applicants and exhibitors who agree to be bound by them.

the shows by intrabrand competitors."" Plaintiff's Opposition to Summary Judgment, Docket No. 74 at 11. "
1031,5," Plaintiff attempts to sidestep the difficulty presented by Colgate and its progeny by asserting that OSEG and Suburban had 
subsequent conversations in which they discussed whether Suburban would allow plaintiff to exhibit the Maxum line. The fact 
that OSEG and Suburban talked, however, does not change the unilateral terms into the product of a conspiracy. Plaintiff never 
alleges that OSEG and Suburban reached a new, or illicit, agreement. Plaintiff merely asserts that they discussed the terms 
unilaterally adopted by OSEG. Plaintiff's Opposition to Summary Judgment, Docket No. 74, Exh. 5, P3. Such conversations do 
not raise antitrust concerns. See, Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 765 (1984) (""to permit the inference of concerted action on the basis of 
receiving complaints [from a competitor] alone and thus to expose the defendant to treble damage liability would both inhibit 
management's exercise of independent business judgment and emasculate the terms of the [antitrust] statute"") (internal 
quotations and citations omitted)."
1031,6," Plaintiff attempts to preserve its claim by asserting that, though unilaterally adopted, OSEG's priority dealer rule resulted in a 
restraint of trade. Yet, it is well settled that ""even where a single firm's restraints directly affect prices and have the same 
economic effect as concerted action might have, there can be no liability under ยง 1 in the absence of an agreement"" as 
contemplated by the antitrust act. Fisher v. City of Berkeley, Cal., 475 U.S. 260, 266, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206, 106 S. Ct. 1045 (1986). 
In other words, even if plaintiff were hurt by OSEG's priority dealer rule, that hurt does not rise to the level of an antitrust claim. "
1033,7," The First Circuit has distinguished between vertical and horizontal agreements as follows: It is important to distinguish between ""horizontal"" restraints, i.e., agreements between competitors at the same level of 
market structure, and ""vertical"" restraints, i.e., combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure such as 
manufacturers and distributorsโฆ. HN18[
] Horizontal restraints alone have been characterized as ""naked restraints of 
trade with no purpose except stifling competition,"" โฆ and, therefore, per se violations of the Sherman Act. On the other 
hand, HN19[
] while vertical restrictions may reduce intrabrand competition by limiting the number of sellers of a particular 
product, competing for a given group of buyers, they also promote interbrand competition by allowing a manufacturer to 
achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of its productsโฆ. They are, therefore, to be examined under a rule of reason 
standard. M & H Tire Co., 733 F.2d at 978."
1033,8," In Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) the Supreme Court 
explained the difference between interbrand and intrabrand competition in the context of television manufacturing: HN21[
] Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product -- television sets 
in this case -- and is the primary concern of antitrust law. The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is 
monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the 
distributors -- wholesale or retail -- of the product of a particular manufacturer. "
1034,," The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the 
manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive 
industry. But when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check 
on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the 
same product. Id. at 52 n. 19. "
1037,1," To the extent one believes that the worth of an idea can be measured in part by the consistency with which it is advocated, it 
may be noted that plaintiffs' counsel in this action have not pursued their conspiracy theory in a case they have filed on behalf of "
1038,," other plaintiffs under the California antitrust statute, which forecloses any Illinois Brick defense. Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 
720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977)."
1038,2," Plaintiffs allege that the OEM defendants and Microsoft entered into exclusive dealing distribution arrangements and employed 
other unspecified ""practices to exclude horizontal competition for Microsoft's"" operating system software. (FAC PP 61-62.) 
However, these arrangements and practices are entirely unspecified, and plaintiffs' conclusory averments are not supported by 
any underlying factual assertions. "
1039,3," Defendants contend that any claims based upon the per-processor licensing fees and long-term distribution contracts would be 
barred by limitations. I need not decide that question since it is clear that those contracts terminated well before the end of the 
class period and thus could not themselves support the class claims that by their nature require conduct continuing throughout 
the class period."
1039,4," Of course, in most cases (where plaintiffs allege a restraint of trade that may or may not be sufficiently effective to threaten or 
result in monopolization), section 1 and section 2 conspiracy claims can be separately pursued without plaintiffs being required 
to plead and prove section 2 elements as part of their section 1 claims. The ""threshold showing"" in such cases for both the 
section 1 and section 2 claims are the same. See, e.g., Weit v. Cont'l Ill. Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 641 F.2d 457, 458 (7th Cir. 
1981) (addressing conspiracy charges pursued under both sections); see also United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 106, 92 L. 
Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948) (exploring the relationship between section 1 and section 2 claims), overruled on other grounds, 
Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 763 n.8, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984); cf. Seagood 
Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1573 (11th Cir. 1991) (noting common ""threshold showing"" required by the two 
sections); Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1460 n.35 (11th Cir. 1991) (same); Wagner v. Magellan Health 
Servs. Inc., 121 F. Supp. 2d 673, 679 & n.1 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (same). However, since the section 2 claim has a higher intent 
requirement than does the section 1 claim, plaintiffs might prevail on the latter claim while losing on the former.  Wagner, 121 F. 
Supp. 2d at 681 HN2[
] (""A conspiracy to monopolize under Section 2 is somewhat different from its Section 1 counterpart because of its heightened intent element.""). In the present case, that is not so, given the nature of plaintiffs' allegations and the 
admittedly fierce competition in the market in which the OEM defendants compete. The section 1 and section 2 claims 
necessarily rise and fall together since the only unlawful intent alleged is the intent to preserve Microsoft's monopolies. Cf. 3A 
Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 810 (1996) (""In those instances where power is a prerequisite to 
holding an agreement to be an unreasonable restraint of trade [under section 1] . . . it would make no sense to hold the same 
agreement offensive to ยง 2 without proof of power.""). "
1040,5," As indicated earlier in the text, plaintiffs allege that these benefits included relatively favorable prices for Microsoft products, 
greater cooperation from Microsoft in product development, the protection of market positions by ensuring that Windows-based 
offerings would not be undercut by rivals offering computer hardware with lower-priced software or without pre-installed 
software, and the ability to sell more computer hardware because Microsoft's operating system software requires greater 
hardware capacity. It would appear that only the first two categories of benefits were uniquely bestowed upon the OEM 
defendants in return for their alleged ready acquiescence."
1040,6," Of course, the mere fact that a defendant is coerced into joining a conspiracy does not alone constitute a defense. United 
States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 161, 92 L. Ed. 1260, 68 S. Ct. 915 (1948); Spectators' Communication 
Network, 231 F.3d at 1010-12 (listing cases). However, as I have stated, even willful and voluntary acceptance of restrictions 
imposed by a monopolist is not the equivalent of forming the specific intent to further the monopoly. It follows a fortiori that 
coerced acceptance of a monopolist's restrictions does not constitute such intent. It is noteworthy that plaintiffs have expressly 
declined to take a position as to whether the OEM defendants were coerced into entering into Microsoft's restrictive agreements. 
(Gravity Pls.' Opp'n at 21-22.) "
1041,7," An apparent paradox of plaintiffs' claims is that, at least in the short run, the OEMs' ability to obtain cheaper prices for software 
from Microsoft presumably benefitted consumers, at least on price, since the OEMs were selling in a highly competitive market. "
1047,1," Although Microsoft removed a number of these cases from state courts, it did not attempt to remove seventy-three other 
actions filed in state court because it believed those cases did not have an arguable basis for federal jurisdiction. By the parties' 
tally, fifty-eight of these cases remain pending."

conspired with it to commit antitrust violations. The present plaintiffs do not pursue that theory. I am today issuing a separate 
opinion in Gravity. "

1169 (8th Cir. 1998) (""'Indirect purchasers' generally lack standing under the antitrust laws . . . .""); McCarthy v. Recordex Serv., 
Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 847-48 (3d Cir. 1996) (associating Illinois Brick with ""antitrust standing doctrine""), the Supreme Court 
expressly stated in Illinois Brick that it was not ""addressing the standing issue."" 431 U.S. at 728 n.7. The Court indicated that 
""the question of which persons have been injured by an illegal overcharge for purposes of section 4 is analytically distinct from 
the question of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give them standing."" Id. To the extent that plaintiffs argue 
that the Illinois Brick rule has been displaced by the standing analysis of Associated General Contractors v. California State 
Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983) (""AGC""), they are incorrect. Although the Third 
Circuit did so suggest in In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144, 1168 (3d Cir. 1993), the court later 
repudiated that suggestion in McCarthy, 80 F.3d at 850-51. Any doubt on the issue is dispelled by the fact that in Kansas v. 
Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 2807 (1990), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Illinois Brick 
rule without mentioning AGC."
1051,4," See Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., 2000 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2866, No. X-06-CV-000160064S (Conn. Sup. Ct. Oct. 10, 2000); 
Siena v. Microsoft Corp., 2000 R.I. Super. LEXIS 63, C.A. No. 00-1647 (R.I. Super. Ct. Aug. 21, 2000); Weinberg v. Microsoft 
Corp., No. D-162, 526 (Tex. Dist. Ct. Aug. 18, 2000); Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00-CI-00123 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 21, 2000);

Case No. A416361 (Nev. Dist. Ct. June 22, 2000). But see Friedman v. Microsoft Corp., CV 2000-000722 (Super. Ct. Ariz. Nov. 
15, 2000). "
1053,5," Lower Lake Erie, upon which plaintiffs rely, is not to the contrary. There, the court permitted plaintiffs to recover, inter alia, 
damages suffered when the defendants exerted monopoly power to prevent product innovations in the transportation of iron ore. 
However, the lost benefits accrued to the plaintiffs alone. As the court noted, ""the [plaintiff] steel companies were the sole 
customers of the industry involved in the transhipment of ore; indeed, the industry existed for them."" 998 F.2d at 1168. In this 
case it certainly cannot be said that the software industry exists for plaintiffs. They are simply among a multitude of end users of 
software products."
1053,6," Plaintiffs point out that the licenses running from Microsoft to OEMs differ from the EULAs running from Microsoft to 
consumers. The former, in effect, permit OEMs to copy software solely for the purpose of installation. Although apparently true, 
this fact is immaterial. Microsoft does not contend that the EULAs themselves were passed through to consumers, only that (if 
plaintiffs' allegations are correct) the overcharge made in connection with the consumers' EULAs were passed through. "
1054,7," Of course, it is well established that the fact that direct purchasers may choose not to institute antitrust actions of their own 
does not establish an exception to the Illinois Brick rule. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 746 (""We recognize that direct purchasers 
sometimes may refrain from bringing a treble-damages suit for fear of disrupting relations with their suppliers.""); In re Beef 
Industry Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1156 n.8 (5th Cir. 1979) (noting that Illinois Brick emphasizes the ""difficulty of proof,"" as 
opposed to the ""deterrence"" rationale); Technical Learning Collective, Inc. v. Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft, 1980 U.S. Dist. "
1055,," LEXIS 9517, 1980 WL 1943, at *10 (D. Md. 1980) (""Whether future suits by dealers are either speculative or unlikely is 
immaterial; Illinois Brick holds that the possibility of such suits is sufficient."")."
1055,8," Plaintiffs also contend that I should exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. Although it is not evident from 
their memorandum, plaintiffs' counsel clarified at oral argument that they are suggesting that supplemental jurisdiction be 
exercised over claims arising under British, Swiss, or Greek law. Assuming that section 1367 extends to claims arising under 
foreign law, I cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction claims unless plaintiffs have other cognizable claims over which I have 
subject matter jurisdiction. I find that plaintiffs have no such cognizable claims. In any event, even if I had supplemental 
jurisdiction, I would decline to exercise it under the standards set forth in section 1367(c)."
1055,9," The FTAIA also provides that the Sherman Act may apply to ""export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person 
engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a. Plaintiffs do not contend that this provision is 
triggered here. "
1057,10," I recognize that only one of the factors articulated by the Supreme Court in AGC, the existence of more direct victims of the 
alleged antitrust violation, clearly weighs against plaintiffs' standing. 459 U.S. at 537-45. However, the doctrine of standing exists 
independently of any test that has been developed for determining its application in a specific context. To extend a test 
unthinkingly to all other contexts would give the test its own raison d'etre and elevate it over the purpose which it was designed 
to serve. Therefore, since the situation presented here is well beyond that contemplated by AGC, application of the AGC factors 
would be inappropriate. The legislative history of the FTAIA itself is dispositive of the standing issue. "
1058,11," These cases are Aikens; Bernard; Brandt; Brems; Campbell; Cheeseman; Colebank; Falgoust; Gianni; Glase; Guice; Haynes; 
Howard; Jaffe; Klein; Kloth; Knight; Mandel; Manson; McCall; McWhinney; Mims; Moon; Moscowitz; Nielsen; O'Neill; Penix; 
Pryor (New Jersey); Pryor (New York); Ray; Rubbright Group; South Dakota Ass'n of Plumbing Contractors; Seastrom; Strickley; 
Supernovich; Turner; Weinke; and Wilson."
1058,12," Six cases that had been removed by Microsoft were remanded to state court prior to the MDL transfer to this district. See 
Edwards, (D.N.M. Mar. 27, 2000); Bellinder, (D. Kan. Mar. 24, 2000); Melnick, (D.Me. Mar. 8, 2000); Baptiste, (S.D. Fla. Feb. 29, 
2000); Hartman, (S.D. Fla. Feb. 29, 2000); Sherwood, (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 22, 2000). Microsoft did not attempt to remove seventy-
three other actions filed in state court because Microsoft believed those cases did not have an arguable basis for federal 
jurisdiction."
1058,13," Several ancillary issues particular to the law of Mississippi and Louisiana, addressed infra in Parts IV(A)(3) and IV(A)(4), are 
also raised."
1058,14," These cases are Campbell; Colebank; Haynes; Jaffe; Kloth; Knight; McCall; McWhinney; Mims; Nielsen; O'Neill; South Dakota 
Ass'n of Plumbing Contractors; Rubbright Group; Weinke; and Wilson. The parties dispute whether all of these cases make 
claims for injunctive relief. Having reviewed the complaints, I am satisfied that they do. "
1059,15," Although I do not cite the case as authority, see 4th Cir. R. 36(c), I note that the Fourth Circuit did apply the either viewpoint 
rule in an unpublished opinion.  Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Hayes, 122 F.3d 1061, 1997 WL 568673, at *3 (4th Cir. 1997). I 
further note that, as the parties have stated, I must apply Fourth Circuit law as the transferee court in an MDL proceeding. See In 
re Am. Honda Motor Co. Dealerships Relations Litig., 941 F. Supp. 528, 536-37 (D. Md. 1996). If these cases are returned to 
transferor courts, presumably the rulings I make in this opinion will be binding under the doctrine of the law of the case, 
particularly if the Fourth Circuit reviews these rulings on interlocutory appeal. See In re Korean Airlines Disaster, 265 U.S. App. 
D.C. 39, 829 F.2d 1171, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1987), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U.S. 122, 
104 L. Ed. 2d 113, 109 S. Ct. 1676 (1989)."
1059,16," Plaintiffs argue that Microsoft's cost of compliance can be considered only if Microsoft can establish that plaintiffs have a 
""common and undivided interest"" in the injunctions they are seeking, thus bringing the case into a recognized exception to the 
non-aggregation rule of Snyder and Zahn. See Snyder, 394 U.S. at 355. Of course, the cost to the defendant of an injunction 
running in favor of one plaintiff will often be used as the test to determine the amount in controversy in class actions and other 
multi-plaintiff cases. And, as the Seventh Circuit pointed out in Brand Name, unless the rule is applied in such cases, there is a 
risk that ""the non-aggregation rule would be violated."" 123 F.3d at 610. Properly understood, however, the test is not derived 
from, and stands independently of, the common and undivided exception to Snyder and Zahn. It places the focus upon the 
amount placed in controversy by the claim of a single plaintiff. That said, in a case such as this where an injunction in favor of a 
single plaintiff -- compliance with which would cost the defendant in excess of the jurisdictional amount -- would provide the "
1060,," same benefit to all other plaintiffs, the test yields a result consonant with the purpose of the common and undivided interest 
exception. Cf. Hoffman v. Vulcan Materials Co., 19 F. Supp. 2d 475 (M.D.N.C. 1998)."
1060,17," These cases are Aikens; Brandt; Brems, P.C.; Campbell; Cheeseman; Davenport; Falgoust; Gianni; Glase; Howard; Klein; 
Kloth; Mandel; McCall; McWhinney; Moon; Moscowitz; Penix; Pryor (New Jersey); Pryor (New York); Ray; Seastrom Associates 
Ltd.; Strickley; Supernovich; and Turner. The parties dispute (just as they dispute whether certain cases claim injunctive relief, 
see supra note 14) whether all of these cases make claims for disgorgement of unlawfully obtained profits. Having reviewed the 
complaints, I am satisfied that they do."
1060,18," There is a second, largely unspoken, differentiating factor. The opinions in Gilman II and Aetna II, unlike those in In re 
Cardizem and Aetna I, reflected a deep-seated concern that the prayer for disgorgement was being utilized to bring into federal 
court a series of small claims that did not belong there. "
1061,19," If that is so as a matter of the applicable substantive law, it is not clear to me why federal jurisdiction must be based upon the 
common and undivided interest exception to the non-aggregation rule of Zahn and Snyder. Jurisdiction would then be founded 
not upon the aggregation of the claims of different plaintiffs but the single claim of any one of them. Cf. supra note 16. It is for 
that reason that I added the qualifying prepositional phrase ""under prevailing precedents"" when earlier stating in the text what 
the jurisdictional question turns upon."
1061,20," Microsoft removed one other case, Bernard. In its opposition memorandum, Microsoft effectively concedes that this removal 
was improper. (Microsoft's Opp'n Mot. to Remand at 15 n.19.) I will therefore remand that case as well. "
1062,21," Microsoft also contends that McWhinney and Falgoust, two of the cases requesting, respectively, injunctive relief and 
disgorgement on state law claims, also assert claims arising under federal antitrust laws. The federal question issue in 
McWhinney is the same as that presented in Supernovich, and the federal question issue in Falgoust is similar to the one posed 
in Aikens."
1062,22," In addition, Microsoft moves to dismiss five other claims on miscellaneous grounds. First, it asserts that Louisiana law, La. Civ. 
Code art. 2298, bars plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment because they are pursuing other theories that would entitle them to 
an equivalent remedy. See Thompson v. Taylor, 192 So. 2d 609, 613 (La. Ct. App. 1966); Jeffrey Oakes, Art. 2298: The 
Codification of the Principle Forbidding Unjust Enrichment, and The Elimination of Quantum Meruit As a Basis for Recovery in 
Louisiana, 56 La. L. Rev. 873, at *12 (1996). Second, it contends that plaintiffs cannot assert a claim under the Maryland 
Consumer Protection Act because the actionable unfair or deceptive trade practices listed in the statute do not include 
monopolistic conduct or other violations of the Maryland Antitrust Act. Md. Code Ann., Comm. Law ยงยง 13-301, 303. Third, it 
argues that the allegations made under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. 
tit. 73, ยงยง 201-1 to -9, are not made with sufficient particularity. Finally, it seeks dismissal of the claims under Ohio and 
Tennessee antitrust statutes because those statutes do not apply to unilateral conduct. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ยงยง 1331.01-.99; 
Tenn. Code Ann. ยงยง 47-25-101, 106. The first two contentions are. As to the third, while the allegations are conclusory, I find "
1063,," them to be sufficient. The fourth contention, while correctly reciting Ohio and Tennessee law, is irrelevant because the 
complaints allege not only unilateral conduct, but also conspiratorial conduct."
1063,23," These cases are Mims (Arizona); Ray (Arizona); Brems (Iowa); Howard (Kentucky); Strickley (Kentucky); McCall (Maryland); 
Pryor (New Jersey); DeJulius (Ohio); Glase (Ohio); Kloth (Ohio); and Prentice (Oklahoma)."
1063,24," These cases are Mims (Arizona); Moscowitz (Connecticut); Howard (Kentucky); Strickley (Kentucky); Aikens (Louisiana); 
Falgoust (Louisiana); Manson (Louisiana); McCall (Massachusetts); Turner Corp. (Massachusetts); Kloth (Ohio); Glase (Ohio); 
DeJulius (Ohio); Campbell (South Carolina); and Cheeseman (Vermont). "
1064,25," Plaintiffs' claim under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act fails, however, for the independent reason that the actionable 
unfair or deceptive trade practices listed in the statute do not include monopolistic conduct or other violations of the Maryland 
Antitrust Act. See supra note 22. "
1066,26," These cases are Mandel; Pryor; and Seastrom Associates Ltd. The Pryor case will survive the motion to dismiss to the extent 
that it includes New York common law claims, which, unlike Donnelly Act claims, are permissible in a class action suit under 
New York law. "
1067,27," I do not believe that there is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion about my dismissal of the foreign plaintiffs' claims 
under customary international law. However, in the event that the Fourth Circuit permits an interlocutory appeal on other rulings, 
particularly my dismissal of the foreign plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims, it might be appropriate for me to enter judgment in favor of 
Microsoft on the customary international law claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). I will discuss this question with counsel. "
1073,1," The statutes under which this action was brought, Combinations in Restraint of Trade and Unfair Discrimination or Competition, 
79 O.S. 1991 ยง 1 et. seq., were repealed by Laws 1998, c. 356 ยง 14 and replaced by the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act, 79 
O.S. Supp. 1998 ยง 201 et seq., Laws 1998, c. 356 ยง 1, effective July 1, 1998. Section 203 of the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act 
defines ""monopolize"" as: ""The possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, and the wilful acquisition or maintenance of 
that power by exclusionary conduct as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product and or 
service, business acumen or historic accident."" 79 O.S. Supp. 1998 ยง 203D(1)(a)(b). Monopoly power is defined as the power to 
control market prices or exclude competition. ยง 203(2). Section 212 states that the Act shall be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with federal antitrust law, 15 U.S.C. section 1, et seq., and the case law applicable thereto. "
1074,2," Plaintiff in his affidavit defines ""teleradiology"" as a method of practicing radiology from afar when either a patient or an X-Ray is 
submitted to him for interpretation and the patient or the X-Ray comes from a distance. "
1075,3," Plaintiff claimed that, but for defendants' actions, he could have established a teleradiology network, but he failed to indicate 
any actions on the part of defendants that prevented him from establishing a teleradiology network. Plaintiff attached a copy of 
CCMH's June 4 prospectus for a teleradiology network in which CCMH refers to the Oklahoma Teleradiology or Telemedicine 
Network operating from the University of Oklahoma that would provide services to small hospitals that those hospitals would be 
unable to provide for themselves. CCMH foresaw itself a ""hub"" of such network, serving eight other hospitals in the area. "
1076,4," ยง 1. Trust In Restraint Of Trade Illegal. Every act, agreement, contract, or combination in the form of trust, or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or

1079,5," ยง 3. Combinations In Restraint Of Trade Unlawful. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, firm, association, corporation, or joint-stock company, or agent thereof, to 
issue, or to own, trust certificates, or for any person, firm, partnership, association, joint-stock company, or corporation, 
agent, officer, employee, or the director or stockholders of any corporation, association or joint-stock company, to enter into 
any combination, contract or agreement with any person, corporation or association, firm, or partnership, or with any stock 
holder, director or officer, agent or employee of the same, the purpose or effect of which combination, contract or 
agreement shall be to place the management or control of such combination or combinations, or the conduct or operation of 
the same, or the output or manufactured product thereof, or the marketing of the same, in the hands of any trust or trustees, 
holding corporation or association, firm or committee, with the intent or effect to limit or fix the price, or lessen the 
production or sale of any product or article of commerce, or the use or consumption of the same, or to prevent, restrict, limit 
or diminish the manufacture or output of any such article of commerce, use or consumption; and every person, firm,

shall enter into any such combination, contract, management or agreement for the purpose aforesaid, shall be deemed and 
adjudged guilty of conspiracy in restraint of trade, and punished as provided for in Section 8228 in so far as applicable: 
Provided, that this section shall not be construed to extend beyond the scope and meaning of the first section of this article. ยง 4. Public Business Defined - Duty To Serve Public. Whenever any business, by reason of its nature, extent, or the existence of a virtual monopoly therein, is such that the 
public must use the same, or its services, or the consideration by it given or taken or offered, or the commodities bought or 
sold herein are offered or taken by purchase or sale in such a manner as to make it of public consequence or to affect the 
community at large as to supply, demand, or price or rate thereof, or said business is conducted in violation of the first 
section of this article, said business is a public business, and subject to be controlled by the state, by the Corporation 
Commission or by an action in any district court of the state, as to all of its practices, prices, rates and charges. And it is 
hereby declared to be the duty of any person, firm, or corporation engaged in any public business to render its services and 
offer its commodities or either upon reasonable terms without discrimination and adequately to the needs of the public, 
considering the facilities of said business"
1079,6," Only after the Court of Civil Appeals questioned whether the judgment was final because of possible unresolved conspiracy 
claims did plaintiff first urge ""conspiracy to monopolize"" as a separate theory of recovery. "
1080,7," The antitrust laws were designed to protect competition, not competitors.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 344, 
82 S. Ct. 1502, 1534, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). "
1092,1," Specific written objections may be filed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 636, and Rule 6.02, Local Rules, M.D. Fla., within ten 
(10) days after service of this report and recommendation. Failure to file timely objections shall bar the party from a de novo 
determination by a district judge and from attacking factual findings on appeal."
1092,2," AlliedSignal changed its name to Honeywell International, Inc. during the course of these proceedings and, accordingly, 
""AlliedSignal"" and ""Honeywell"" are used interchangeably throughout this report and recommendation."
1092,3," For example, in 1993, Honeywell sold $ 345 million of automotive parts to its largest OEM customers in North America and only 
$ 15 million to its North American van conversion customers. (Doc. 65, Tab F, Ford Decl. at P5.) "
1093,4," In the mid 1990s the sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and ""factory custom vans"" began to increase thus cutting into the 
market of van conversions. From 1994 to 1998 the number of sales of conversion vans declined each year and only 148,600 "
1094,," conversion vans were sold in 1998 compared to 259,600 sold in 1994, the peak of sales for conversion vans in the 1990s. (Doc. 
129, Ex. A, Fishkind Report at 6). "
1096,5," The only other evidence of an agreement is exhibit 34. This document is a single page of a ""memo to R.A. Lavanture"" which 
makes statements such as ""should increase VSSI prices and decrease [Lavanture] now! (Volume, disruption war)"" and [why it is] 
""so hard to say that LPC is the only distributor."" In a separate order the Court has determined the document is not admissible 
because the document is hearsay and there are no exceptions to the admissibility of the document that apply."
1096,6," Per se illegality has been limited to four categories of restraints: (1) horizontal and vertical price fixing; (2) horizontal market 
divisions; (3) group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal; and (4) tying arrangements. See, Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, 
Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1567 n.33 (11th Cir. 1991). None of these are alleged in the instant case. "
1097,7," HN7[
] Defining a relevant market is also essential to establishing a ยง 2 Sherman Act claim. The criteria for establishing a relevant market under ยง 1 and ยง 2 of the Sherman Act are essentially the same."
1097,8," Honeywell argues at length that Dr. Fishkind should not be allowed to change his position in order to avoid summary judgment. 
(Doc. 178 at 2.) Although there is a lack of clarity on this issue in Dr. Fishkind's testimony, at deposition and at the Daubert 
hearing, his expert report does affirmatively define the relevant market as ""safety restraint systems for the van conversion 
industry in the U.S."" (Doc. 129, Ex. A at 2.) While the conflicting answers given by Dr. Fishkind regarding the market may be 
fertile ground for cross-examination at trial, the testimony does not rise to the level of the type of direct contradiction, which 
courts have held cannot be used to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See, Van T. Junkins & Assoc., Inc., v. U.S. 
Industries, Inc., 736 F.2d 656, 657 (11th Cir. 1984). Accordingly, the court concludes that definition of market in the report 
submitted by Dr. Fishkind can be used by VSSI in opposing Honeywell's motion for summary judgment. "
1099,9," Regarding the issue of the relevant geographic market there is no serious dispute as to this issue in view of the fact that 
AlliedSignal only sold seat belts to van conversion businesses within the United States and Lavanture and VSSI similarly only 
sold seat belts to van conversion businesses in the United States."
1099,10," HN14[
] Generally, interbrand competition is defined as competition among suppliers or manufacturers of the same generic 
product, while intrabrand competition is the competition between distributors of the product of a particular supplier or 
manufacturer. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 n. 19, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2558 n. 19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 
(1977). Here, interbrand competition would include competition between Honeywell and other manufacturers, such as TRW or 
Autoliv. Intrabrand competition would involve competition between VSSI and Lavanture. "
1101,11," Indeed, VSSI tacitly concedes that it might not have a viable ยง 1 Sherman claim if Honeywell had simply terminated it rather 
than attempting to transfer VSSI's customers to LaVanture, as VSSI alleges."
1101,12," VSSI also claims that Honeywell violated the Florida Antitrust Act, Fla. Stat. ยง 542.19. HN18[
] Florida courts have held that 
the Florida legislature has effectively adopted the body of antitrust law developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act. 
St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So. 2d 1028 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984). Therefore, the analysis 
under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act applies equally as well to the Florida state law antitrust claims and need not be discussed 
separately."
1101,13," HN20[
] Monopoly power under ยง 2 requires something greater than market power under ยง 1. Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at"
1101,480," , 112 S. Ct. at 2090. "
1103,14," HN26[
] The second prong of a ยง 2 claim is the use of monopoly power to ""foreclose competition, to gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor."" 112 S. Ct. at 2090. VSSI argues that its monopolization claim should be viewed as an 
unlawful maintenance of a monopoly rather than the unlawful acquisition of a monopoly. However, as previously discussed, 
Honeywell's market share fell from 93% to 70%. Accordingly, even assuming VSSI's theory is based on the maintenance of a 
monopoly the same reasoning supporting the Court's conclusion that VSSI has failed to establish monopoly power applies to a 
claim based on maintenance of monopoly power. "
1104,15," Honeywell has argued at length that VSSI's claim is nothing more than a claim by a disappointed distributor, who has been 
terminated. Relying upon this characterization Honeywell argues that a terminated distributor does not have antitrust standing 
because the antitrust laws protect competition and not competitors. The Court agrees that a disappointed distributor does not 
have an antitrust claim nor antitrust standing to complain when it is terminated. However, VSSI bases its antitrust claim on the 
alleged illegal agreement with Lavanture and not solely on the fact that it was terminated. Had VSSI only complained about the 
termination of its distributorship the Court agrees that the antitrust claims should be dismissed. "
1105,16," The phrase ""in pari delicto"" is a Latin phrase which literally translated means ""of equal fault."" "
1107,17," Honeywell also argues that for the same reasons any claims for ""implied"" contract are unenforceable. (Doc.99, at 37). 
Although Honeywell does not reference count VII of the Second Amended Complaint, to the extent Honeywell has requested 
summary judgment as to Count VII the motion is denied for the same reasons that apply to the express contract claim. "
1125,1," The Clayton Act states in pertinent part that: HN1[
] No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the 
whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade "
1126,," Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any 
activity affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the 
country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. Northwest alleges a ""shift"" in Plaintiffs' antitrust theory that it claims should impact the Court's application of the Clayton Act. It 
notes that Plaintiffs adopted a ""holding and use of assets"" theory in order to comply with the 8th Circuit's recent holding in 
Midwestern Machinery, Inc. v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 167 F.3d 439 (8th Cir. 1999), yet it claims that Plaintiffs are actually 
arguing an incompatible theory of anti-competitive effects due to the elimination of Republic as a competitor. Northwest relies on 
Midwestern Machinery and Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, (8th Cir. 2000), as support for its argument. 
The Court declines to address Defendant's argument at this time because the Court finds that it does not impact the issue of 
whether class certification should be granted. Neither side, however, is precluded from raising the issue at a later and 
appropriate time. "
1128,2," Dr. Phillips further posits that an appropriate analysis would require a route-by-route analysis given that some city pairs involve 
multiple airport alternatives making the method of proof even more specialized. For example, the MSP-Washington, D.C. city-
pair incorporates three airports to or from which passengers can fly in addition to MSP, i.e. Reagan National Airport in 
Washington, D.C., Dulles International Airport in Reston, Virginia, or Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland. "
1136,1," Because the plaintiffs' proposed market definition was the fundament for the rest of the theory of liability, the jury was instructed 
that if it answered the relevant market special questions adversely to the plaintiffs, there was no need to go farther. In my 
judgment, this was a proper instruction, consonant with Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a). There is an alternate way of looking at the matter, although I did not articulate it at the time: in effect, after the verdict was 
received, the Rule 50(a) motion could be considered to have been granted pro tanto for the balance of the case, the jury's 
answers having determined the relevant market issue against the plaintiffs, and I having then determined (by having structured 
the special questions as they were) that the plaintiffs' claims could not ""under the controlling law be maintained . . . without a 
favorable finding [to the plaintiffs] on that issue."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). Under either view, the result is the same. "
1137,2," HN3[
] Generally speaking, ""[a] legitimate buyer is entitled to use its market power to keep prices down."" Kartell, 749 F.2d at"
1137,929," . See also Blair, Monopsony, p.69 (""Unilateral efforts by a monopsony to make purchase decisions in full awareness of their 
impact on price traditionally do not violate the antitrust laws.""). Interestingly, one of the ways a monopsonist might abuse monopoly power would be by engaging in predatory pricing whereby it 
raises the price it pays for an input, say labor, in order to increase costs in the short run, making it too unprofitable for others to 
compete and leaving the market to the single, high-paying buyer. See Blair, Monopsony, p.66. Thus, a potential competitor of 
MLS might argue that it was kept out of the market because MLS paid players higher salaries than necessary. In such 
circumstances, however, the players would obviously be benefitted, at least in the short run, and would probably lack an antitrust 
injury that would permit them to object to the predatory scheme. In any event, the plaintiffs did not make such an argument, and 
the evidence was not developed to support it. "
1147,1," DFA does not challenge Lone Star's assertion that the relevant product market is raw grade A milk. In previous case involving 
milk cooperatives, courts have held that this is the relevant product market. See  Alexander v. Nat'l Farmers Org., 687 F.2d 
1173, 1191 (8th Cir. 1981); United States v. Dairymen, Inc., 660 F.2d 192 (6th Cir. 1981)."
1147,2," ""The 'combination or conspiracy' element of ยง 1 is not negated by the fact that one or more of the co-conspirators acted 
unwillingly, reluctantly, or only in response to coercion."" MCM Partners, Inc. v. Andrews-Bartlett & Assoc., Inc., 62 F.3d 967 (7th 
Cir. 1995). "
1148,3," The Seventh Circuit has explained the reason behind the requirement that plaintiffs plead an injury to competition instead of 
merely an injury to a competitor: The legislators who passed the Sherman Act did not make ordinary business torts federal torts for which treble damages 
could be recovered; no such wholesale displacement of state tort law into the federal courts was contemplated or desired . . 
. . Their concern . . . was with practices that by making markets less competitive hurt the people buying from or selling to 
the firms in those markets. To injure, even to cripple or destroy, one or two competitors in a market will not, if there are 
many competitors in that market, have much if any effect on consumers or anyone else besides the competitors in 
question. Sutliff, Inc. v. Donovan Companies, Inc., 727 F.2d 648, 655 (7th Cir. 1984). See also  Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, 826, 89 
L. Ed. 1954, 65 S. Ct. 1545 (1945) (stating that the Sherman Act ""does not purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by 
or against persons engaged in interstate commerce"")."
1148,4," Exclusive dealing arrangements are analyzed under both ยง 1 of the Sherman Act and ยง 3 of the Clayton Act. See, e.g.  Twin 
City Sportservice v. Chas. O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291 (9th Cir. 1982). "
1149,5," Courts have generally required a higher percentage of market foreclosure in cases where the exclusive dealing arrangement is 
with distributors rather the end-users. See  Omega Environmental, Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc, 127 F.3d 1157, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 1997). 
Since raw milk must be processed before it is consumed, the Court considers the processing plants to be the end-consumer of 
raw milk."
1149,6," The Complaint demonstrates an interesting interaction between state tort law and the federal antitrust law. Generally, 
violations of state tort law alone do not expose the defendant to federal antitrust liability. See supra note 3. The Complaint, 
however, alleges that DFA has monopoly power in the relevant market and did not force these processing plants into exclusive 
dealing agreements until they began negotiations with Lone Star. Under these circumstances, the agreements that resulted from "
1150,," DFA's tortious interference with Lone Star's prospective business relations may satisfy ยง 1's ""contract, combination, or 
conspiracy"" requirement and ยง 2's conduct requirement. "
1164,1," Both plaintiff and defendants filed objections to the post-hearing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by 
the opposing parties in connection with the present motion. To the extent that these objections concern matters addressed at the 
hearing conducted on October 22, 1999, the Court relies on its earlier rulings. To the extent defendants object to evidence in 
plaintiff's post-hearing proposed findings of fact not included in plaintiff's original proposed findings of fact, the Court finds that 
such evidence was appropriately included in plaintiff's post-hearing papers. With regard to plaintiff's hearsay objections, the 
Court sustains to the extent the subject evidence is not derived from business records."
1164,2," The services offered by hospitals are often grouped into three general categories. Primary services include basic hospital 
services such as obstetrics, general medicine, and general surgery involved in relatively simple procedures. Secondary services 
are more complex and require more specialized equipment and personnel. Tertiary services involve the most complex and 
highly specialized services such as heart bypass surgery and transplants. "
1167,3," Summit's fiscal year ends on February 28 or 29. Thus, fiscal year 1996 encompasses March 1, 1995 through February 28, 
1996. "
1172,4," For example, if all 100 patients that resided in a particular zip code went to Summit or Alta Bates for acute inpatient services, 
that zip code would be included in Dr. Langenfeld's service area first because Summit and Alta Bates would have 100% of the 
market share of that zip code. If, on the other hand, 100 patients sought acute inpatient services at Summit and Alta Bates from 
a zip code that contained 200 patients, that zip code would be placed considerably further down in Dr. Langenfeld's ranking 
because Summit and Alta Bates would only have 50% of the market share of that zip code. "
1173,5," Using the example outlined above, if two zip codes each contained 100 patients who sought acute inpatient services from 
Summit and Alta Bates, both of those zip codes would be included in Guerin-Calvert's service area in the same order of 
preference regardless of the number of patients residing in those zip codes that sought acute inpatient services elsewhere. 
Similarly, if Summit and Alta Bates drew 100 patients from one zip code and 50 patients from another, the former would be 
ranked higher than the latter, irrespective of the total patient population of the respective zip codes. "
1178,6," Defendants' expert calculated a critical loss figure based on an assumed SNIP imposed by the merged Alta Bates/Summit 
entity as opposed to a hypothetical monopolist. (Def.'s Ex. 1001, Guerin-Calvert Report P 63-64.) Defendants' critical loss 
analysis, although potentially relevant on the issue of anticompetitive effects once a geographic market has been defined, is not 
relevant in analyzing the scope of a proposed geographic market in the first instance. "
1179,7," The disparity between these figures stems from the fact that Dr. Langenfeld calculated multiple critical loss figures using 
different sets of data and assuming different contribution margins for: (1) only managed care patients and (2) all patients. 
(PX1082, Langenfeld Report, Ex. 37.) "
1180,8," It should be noted that plan administrators do not uniformly oppose the proposed merger. For example, the president and CEO 
of Foundation Health Systems, the parent company of Health Net, the second largest health plan in the East Bay, has testified 
that he believes the possibility of a price increase due to the proposed merger is slight based on, inter alia, the ability of MCOs to 
steer patients to lower cost facilities if faced with increased prices. (Def.'s Ex. 1012, Decl. Gellert at 14-17) "

1198,3," ""Wheeling"" refers to a common industry practice where utility A delivers electricity to utility A's customers through utility B's 
transmission facilities."
1198,4," Originally, SRVEA included in its complaint an allegation that PacifiCorp violated antitrust laws by refusing to sell SRVEA 
electricity wholesale. SRVEA asserts that only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over wholesale 
interstate sales of electricity, thus PacifiCorp is not shielded by the Electric Supplier Stabilization Act. Since that point, however, 
SRVEA has entered into a contract with another supplier, Enron, for the wholesale purchase of electricity. Although Enron has 
the right to cancel its contract with SRVEA, PacifiCorp stipulated to the district court that it would provide wholesale electricity to 
SRVEA if Enron cancelled its contract and PacifiCorp is found to violate the antitrust statutes in the present case. Thus, any 
claim relating to PacifiCorp's refusal to sell electricity to SRVEA appears to be moot. See United States Parole Commn. v. 
Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479, 100 S. Ct. 1202 (1980). Since we remand this case to the district court, we need 
not resolve these issues."
1198,5," SRVEA also alleged that PacifiCorp violated several provisions of state law and violated federal antitrust laws with respect to 
four Idaho customers who are not presently served by PacifiCorp. SRVEA waived these claims (without conditions) after the 
district court granted summary judgment. After reviewing the parties' briefs, we are satisfied the district court's order is a final 
order. See Robertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 749 F.2d 530 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding that voluntary dismissal of causes of

34, 45-46, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 105 S. Ct. 1713 (1985), made clear that an actor's conduct need not be compelled in order to be 
protected under Parker: None of our cases involving the application of the state action exemption to a municipality has required that compulsion be 
shown. [Past cases] spoke in terms of the State's direction or authorization of the anticompetitive practice at issue. This is 
so because . . . compulsion is simply unnecessary as an evidentiary matter to prove that the challenged practice constitutes 
state action. In short, although compulsion affirmatively expressed may be the best evidence of state policy, it is by no 
means a prerequisite to a finding that a municipality acted pursuant to clearly articulated state policy."

monopoly position in the hospital market. See Delaware Health Care I, 893 F. Supp. at 1288, 1289-90 (analyzing ยง 2 challenge

1217,1," 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a. In full, the FTAIA reads: Sections 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import 
commerce) with foreign nations unless- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect- (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with 
foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United 
States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section. Proviso If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then sections 
1 to 7 of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States. "
1218,2," The first group of defendants, HeereMac v.o.f. and its subsidiaries, a foreign corporation with its principal place of business in 
The Netherlands, controlled four or five of the barges. Saipem S.p.A., a British company, controlled one heavy-lift barge. 
McDermott, Inc., an American corporation, apparently controlled the last barge."
1218,3," Statoil does not allege that it purchased any heavy-lift services in the United States or that the contracts it entered into included 
agreements to apply United States law."
1218,4," Statoil asserts that it has exported an average of 400,000 barrels of oil a day into the United States over the past three years. 
Statoil does not, however, allege any injury to itself derived from its export of oil to the United States."
1218,5," Statoil does not allege that it owns, operates, or commissions any oil exploration platforms within United States waters, or that 
it conducted business with any of the defendants incorporated in the United States."
1218,6," The plea agreement separately addressed issues related to commerce affected by defendants' conduct in the Gulf of Mexico 
and commerce affected by defendants' activity in the North Sea and Far East."
1218,7, A group of about forty plaintiffs brought a second suit against defendants in the Northern District of Texas.
1218,8," The court determined it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the alleged conspiracy and injury ""relating to the Mahogany 
project in the territorial waters of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico."" "
1219,9," The court stated that ""the claims of the foreign-based subsidiaries regarding injuries sustained in relation to the foreign 
platforms"" were not justiciable in United States courts because ""the primary injury to that party must be caused in the United 
States and substantially affect United States commerce."""
1219,10," The defendants filed motions to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction (Rule 12(b)(1)) and failure to state a claim 
under the Sherman Act (Rule 12(b)(6))."
1219,11," The court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining common law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 
1367 (c)(3)."
1219,12," The first case to consider the extraterritorial application of United States antitrust law was American Banana Co. v. United 
Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 29 S. Ct. 511, 53 L. Ed. 826 (1909). In that case, Justice Holmes announced that the Sherman Act 
could have no application to conduct that occurred outside of the United States. Id. at 357. However, as the United States 
became increasingly involved in foreign commerce in the years following American Banana, the Supreme Court relaxed its 
previous stance and held that the Sherman Act authorized jurisdiction over foreign defendants so long as domestic commerce 
was affected and some conduct occurred within the United States See  United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 276, 
47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927). In 1945, the Second Circuit laid the groundwork for what became known as the ""effects test"" to determine antitrust jurisdiction 
over foreign conduct. In United States v. Aluminum Company of America (""Alcoa""), 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945), Judge Learned 
Hand determined that a United States court would have jurisdiction over the conduct of foreign corporations where that conduct 
was intended to, and actually did, affect United States commerce. Id. at 443-44. The Alcoa effects test has been gradually 
adopted by most federal courts, albeit in various forms. The already confused effects test was even more imprecise following the Ninth Circuit's decision in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. 
Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597, 613 (9th Cir. 1976). In that case, the court introduced a balancing test that considered principles 
of comity in addition to domestic effects when determining the scope of antitrust jurisdiction over foreign defendants. The Fifth 
Circuit adopted a similar comity-informed approach. See  American Rice, Inc. v. Arkansas Rice Growers Co-op Ass'n, 701 
F.2d 408, 413 (5th Cir. 1983). Most recently, in 1993, the Supreme Court confirmed that ""the Sherman Act applies to foreign 
conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States."" Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. 
California, 509 U.S. 764, 796, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993). "
1220,13," In fact, no circuit appears to have interpreted the critical portion of the FTAIA at issue in this case--the requirement that the 
domestic effect on commerce ""gives rise"" to the antitrust claim. 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a (2)."
1220,14," It is true that the defendants filed 12(b)(6) motions along with their 12(b)(1) motions. However, the district court's order 
establishes that the court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction rather than failure to state a claim under the 
antitrust laws: The court orders that Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are granted and that this case is 
dismissed without prejudice. All remaining pending motions are moot."
1220,15," Statoil refers to the legislative history of the FTAIA to support its interpretation: The Committee did not believe that the bill reported by the subcommittee was intended to confer jurisdiction on injured 
foreign persons when that injury arose from conduct with no anticompetitive effects in the domestic marketplace. Consistent 
with this conclusion, the full committee added language to the Sherman and FTC Act amendments to require that the 
'effect' providing the jurisdictional nexus must also be the basis for the injury alleged under the antitrust laws. This does not, 
however, mean that the impact of the illegal conduct must be experienced by the injured party within the United States. H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, at 12."
1220,16," Statoil cites additional legislative history in support of this interpretation of the FTAIA: . . . The domestic 'effect' that may serve as the predicate for antitrust jurisdiction under the bill must be of the type that the 
antitrust laws prohibit. For example, a plaintiff would not be able to establish United States antitrust jurisdiction merely by 
proving a beneficial effect within the United States, such as increased profitability of some other company or increased 
domestic employment, when the plaintiff's damage claim is based on an extraterritorial effect on him of a different kind. H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, at 12 (1982) (citation omitted). "
1221,17," In addition to its statutory interpretation arguments, Statoil cites a number of cases in an attempt to support its proposition that 
subject matter jurisdiction exists under the Sherman Act so long as the conspiratorial conduct had an affect on United States 
commerce. See  Caribbean Broad. Sys., Ltd. v. Cable and Wireless PLC, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 148 F.3d 1080 (D.C. Cir. 
1998); United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997); Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. 764, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612, 113 
S. Ct. 2891; Pfizer, Inc. v. Gov't of India, 434 U.S. 308, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563 (1978). However, none of these cases 
interpret the relevant provision of the FTAIA (15 U.S.C. ยง 6a (2)) and, therefore, none of these cases inform our inquiry into the 
proper interpretation of the ""gives rise to"" requirement."
1221,18," This interpretation is further strengthened by the limits placed on Congressional power in the Constitution. Article I, ยง 8 of the 
Constitution gives Congress the authority only to regulate interstate commerce and ""commerce with foreign nations"" (emphasis 
added). Thus, even if Congress indeed intended to regulate purely foreign commerce in the Sherman Act, it was not empowered 
to do so under the Commerce Clause."
1221,19," The dissent, like Statoil, argues that Section 2 should be read to require only that the domestic effect give rise to any antitrust 
claim, not necessarily the plaintiff's claim. This interpretation contradicts the explicit intent of Congress to require that the effect 
must give rise to the particular injury claimed by the plaintiff in the suit: . . . The full committee added language to the Sherman and FTC Act amendments to require that the 'effect' providing the 
jurisdictional nexus must also be the basis for the injury alleged under the antitrust laws. H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, at 12 (emphasis added). "
1222,," The dissent asserts that reading Section 2 as requiring that the domestic effect give rise to the plaintiff's claim renders the 
FTAIA's proviso redundant. Although giving the statute a clear understanding is difficult, we disagree with the dissent's reading. 
We read Section 1(B) to provide that the export commerce covered under the exception must be conducted by a person who is 
engaged in that export business in the United States. Section 2 provides that the defendant's antitrust effect on this export 
commerce described in Section 1(B) must give rise to the plaintiff's cause of action. The proviso, in turn, states that the recovery 
for injuries resulting from the conduct described in Section 1(B), which gives rise to the plaintiff's antitrust claim in Section 2, is 
limited to injuries occurring in the United States. Therefore, we fail to see the redundancy to which the dissent refers. See In re 
Copper Antitrust Litigation v. Sumitomo Corp., 117 F. Supp. 2d 875, 2000 WL 1521587, at *10 (W.D. Wis. 2000) (holding that 
""the logical interpretation of the language of ยง 6a is that Congress extends domestic jurisdiction to extraterritorial conduct only 
when the plaintiffs have been injured by the effects on the domestic market."")."
1222,20," Specifically, Statoil's claim falls under Section 6(a)(1)(A) and not Section 6(a)(1)(B), because defendants' conduct had no 
substantial effect on export trade with foreign nations."
1222,21," Statoil's complaint alleges that the defendants' conspiracy adversely affected at least $ 165 million in United States commerce 
during the 1993-97 period."
1222,22," Statoil repeatedly frames the inquiry as whether a plaintiff can suffer injury abroad, or whether the injury itself must be suffered 
in the United States. This approach is an incorrect formulation of the threshold question and reflects a misreading of the FTAIA. 
We recognize that many federal courts, including the district court in these proceedings, might have chosen to frame the 
analysis in this manner. However, the proper inquiry to make here is, regardless of the situs of the plaintiff's injury, did that injury 
arise from the anticompetitive effects on United States commerce? See, e.g., Caribbean, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 148 F.3d 
1080 (identifying that, while the situs of the injury was overseas, the claim arose from the conspiracy's effects on the United 
States advertising market)."
1222,23," The dissent notes with disapproval that our interpretation of the FTAIA means that ""a foreign cartel that fixes prices worldwide 
will be subject to suit under the Clayton Act only from plaintiffs injured in American commerce."" However, our reading produces 
the precise result intended by Congress--that ""foreign purchasers should enjoy the protection of our antitrust laws in the 
domestic marketplace, just as our citizens do."" H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, at 10-11."
1222,24," Statoil argues that, had the district court accepted its allegation of a worldwide conspiracy as true, the requirements of the 
FTAIA would be satisfied and subject matter jurisdiction would exist. We cannot agree. Regardless of the nature of the "
1223,," conspiracy, Statoil must allege an injury that falls within the scope of the antitrust statutes. The assumed existence of a single, 
unified, global conspiracy does not relieve Statoil of its burden of alleging that its injury arose from the conspiracy's proscribed 
effects on United States commerce. This principle was stressed by the Supreme Court in Matsushita: Respondents also argue that the check prices, the five company rule, and the price fixing in Japan are all part of one large 
conspiracy that includes monopolization of the American market through predatory pricing. The argument is mistaken. 
However one decides to describe the contours of the asserted conspiracy--whether there is one conspiracy or several--
respondents must show that the conspiracy caused them an injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief."
1223,475, U.S. at 584 n.7 (emphasis added).
1223,25," The dissent repeatedly emphasizes that the antitrust laws have always contemplated foreign plaintiffs recovering for their 
injuries. We do not disagree. HN11[
] We simply read the FTAIA to provide that, if individuals conspire to restrain trade such 
that an American market is harmed, the United States antitrust laws can provide redress to any person injured by the domestic 
effects of the conspiracy, even if the injured party is located overseas. See  Sumitomo, 2000 WL 1521587, at *11 (""On the other 
hand, the antitrust laws do not apply to an action by a person injured overseas because of price-fixing in a foreign market even if 
the same defendants engage in price-fixing affecting an American market."")."
1223,26," Statoil alleges that it paid inflated prices for heavy-lift services in the North Sea. This injury, however, does not arise from the 
alleged effect on United States commerce--that is, the higher prices paid by United States consumers for heavy-lift services in 
the Gulf of Mexico. While Statoil also asserts that the conspiracy had the effect of raising crude oil prices in the United States, 
Statoil alleges no injuries to itself occurring in the market for crude oil or arising from this domestic effect. "
1224,27," The dissent seems to imply that the sole purpose of the FTAIA is to ""exempt exporting from antitrust scrutiny."" Although this is 
clearly a primary goal of the legislation, the dissent ignores the second purpose behind the FTAIA--to resolve ""possible 
ambiguity"" in the extraterritorial reach of antitrust jurisdiction. Id. at 4-5."
1224,28," The dissent argues that our decision in this case is contrary to the statement in the legislative history that "" a course of conduct 
in the United States . . . would affect all purchasers of the target domestic products or services, whether the purchaser is foreign 
or domestic."" Again, we do not assert that foreign purchasers of domestic products can never sue in United States federal court. 
We only hold that the FTAIA requires that a foreign plaintiff show that its injuries arise from a United States market. This is not a 
novel reading of the FTAIA: The legislative history of the FTAIA reflects that Congress was proceeding from the premise that, wherever title is taken or 
economic injury is suffered, at least some aspect of the sales transaction took place in the United States. Any doubt on that 
score is resolved by . . . the sentence which states that 'foreign purchasers should enjoy the protection of our antitrust laws 
in the domestic marketplace, just as our citizens do.' Nothing is said about protecting foreign purchasers in foreign markets. In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litigation, 127 F. Supp. 2d 702, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 305, at *37 (M.D. Md. Jan. 12, 2001). "
1225,29," See  Sumitomo, 2000 WL 1521587, at *9 (""So far as can be determined, the issue of interpreting the language of Section 2 
never came up. In the reported cases, the courts had no occasion to address the same effects requirement because in each 
case, the plaintiffs' injuries arose out of the same effects experienced by the markets."")."
1225,30," The dissent relies heavily upon Pfizer in asserting that Statoil's claim should be cognizable in United States federal court. The 
Pfizer court, however, did not analyze the requisite elements that must be present before a foreign entity can sue under the 
United States antitrust laws. Indeed, Pfizer's narrow holding was ""only that a foreign nation otherwise entitled to sue in our courts 
is entitled to sue for treble damages under the antitrust laws to the same extent as any other plaintiff."" Id. (emphasis added)."
1225,31," The dissent asserts that we ""struggle"" to reconcile Caribbean Broadcasting with our holding in the case before us. However, 
the court in Caribbean Broadcasting, for whatever reason, completely ignored Section 2 of the FTAIA in its analysis. Given that a 
decision in the case before us requires an interpretation of that provision, we find Caribbean Broadcasting unhelpful to any 
resolution of Statoil's claim. Indeed, we fail to understand how Caribbean Broadcasting provides any meaningful support for the 
dissent's interpretation of Section 2, given that the plaintiff's claim in that case arose from the anticompetitive effects on the 
domestic market for radio advertising in the Caribbean. See 148 F.3d at 1086. "
1226,32," As Statoil has no claim under the United States antitrust laws, we affirm the district court's finding that Statoil lacked standing 
to bring its claims. Based on Associated Gen'l Contractors Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535-45, 
103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), the determination of Statoil's standing to bring its claims is dependent upon our finding 
of subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, in concluding that the FTAIA bars Statoil's claims against defendants under the Sherman 
Act, we have perforce found that Statoil's injury is not of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall. "
1227,33, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 6a (1997).
1227,34," For brevity, I herein refer to the effects required by section 6a(1) as effects on ""United States commerce."""
1227,35, 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a (2) (emphasis added).
1227,36," The effect must cause ""antitrust injury."" The ""effect"" described by section 6a(1) can be beneficial, neutral, or injurious. Section 
6a(2) requires that this effect be injurious and, further, that the injury be caused by reduced, not increased, competition."
1227,37," Courts will not presume that statutory language is redundant or surplusage. The majority's interpretation, however, makes the 
proviso at the end of section 6a redundant. Section 6a(1)(B) states that the Sherman Act applies to conduct with effects on 
""export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States."" 
The proviso limits the applicability of the Sherman Act under section 6a(1)(B) ""to such conduct only for injury to export business 
in the United States."" Thus, while (1)(B) requires only that the conduct affect a person engaged in export trade in the United 
States, the proviso limits recovery under the Sherman Act to such persons. The majority's reading of 6a(2) renders this proviso 
redundant, since it requires that the effect on the exporter in the United States ""give rise to"" the plaintiff's claim -- in other words, 
that the person engaged in export trade be the plaintiff. "
1228,38," Courts have long held that private plaintiffs ""must prove the existence of 'antitrust injury'"" to recover under section 4 of the 
Clayton Act.  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 334, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990). In 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986), the 
Supreme Court noted that the plaintiffs ""must show that the conspiracy caused them an injury for which the antitrust laws provide 
relief."" Id. at 584 n.7. The Court explained that a ""cognizable injury"" is an ""antitrust injury."" Id. at 586."
1228,39," The Clayton Act requires that the plaintiff suffer antitrust injury. The FTAIA, by contrast, requires that the United States suffer 
antitrust injury. Compare Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 15 (a) (providing cause of action to anyone ""injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"") (emphasis added), with FTAIA, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 6a (2) (""gives rise 
to a claim under the Sherman Act "") (emphasis added). When a private plaintiff wishes to sue under the Clayton Act, the Clayton 
Act and FTAIA erect complementary requirements: the plaintiff must suffer antitrust injury, and persons in United States 
commerce must suffer antitrust injury. The majority opinion, on the other hand, appears to conflate these two concepts."
1228,40," Export Trading Company Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-290, 96 Stat. 1233 (codified in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C.)."
1228,41," Export Trading Company Act of 1982 ยง 102, 96 Stat. at 1233-34."
1228,42," ยง 102(b), 96 Stat. at 1234. The Third Circuit has recently cited this language in concluding that ""Congress enacted the FTAIA 
for the purpose of facilitating the export of domestic goods by exempting export transactions that did not injure the United States 
economy from the Sherman Act and thereby relieving exporters from a competitive disadvantage in foreign trade."" Carpet Group 
Int'l v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n, Inc., 227 F.3d 62, 71 (3d Cir. 2000)."
1228,43," Because the language of the statute is clear, we need not resort to its legislative history to discern its purpose. In any case, 
the legislative history only reiterates this single, motivating purpose. See H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted 
in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2487, 2487 (describing the legislation as ""the bill . . . to exclude from the application of the antitrust laws 
certain conduct involving exports"" and ""one of several bills . . . that seek to promote American exports""). The excerpt of 
legislative history upon which the majority relies, that the purpose of the law is ""to more clearly establish when antitrust liability 
attaches to international business activities,"" is certainly a true statement, but it expresses the purpose of the law at a level of 
generality that offers us no guidance on the narrow question we face. What the majority has overlooked is that Congress has 
spoken with much more particularity as to the purpose of this law: the purpose of the FTAIA is to promote exports by exempting 
American exporting activity from the antitrust laws. "
1229,44," This cannot seriously be disputed. The FTAIA does not alter the holding of Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 
54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584 (1978), which allowed foreign governments to sue an American cartel that charged supra-
competitive prices for pharmaceuticals worldwide. The legislative history approves of Pfizer. See H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, 
reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2487, 2495."

1229,48," Because of this, Pfizer is distinguishable from this case, since one can argue, as the majority does, that the injury to the 
foreign plaintiff occurred in the United States. But there is nothing in the reasoning of Pfizer that suggests that the facts of Pfizer 
define the outer limit of the antitrust laws. Further, even if we assume that the plaintiffs in Pfizer were injured in the United 
States, they were injured as buyers in an export transaction from the United States. Under section 6a(1)(B) and the majority's 
reading of the section 6a(2), injuries to buyers of American exports do not create jurisdiction under the antitrust laws. Yet the 
legislative history of the FTAIA cites Pfizer with approval. Pfizer maintains its force after the FTAIA because the conspiracy in 
Pfizer also affected Americans in domestic commerce. This is why section 6a(2) states ""gives rise to a claim"" and not ""gives rise 
to the plaintiff's claim."" "

1283,12," We also note that Frost's tender of damages states it was made as a settlement offer pursuant to section 17.5052 of the 
DTPA, which allows an offer of settlement for an amount other than the demand stated in the consumer's notice of damages. 
Under section 17.5052, if the consumer rejects the defendant's settlement offer, the settlement offer may be filed with the court 
with an affidavit certifying its rejection. See id. ยงยง 17.505(f), 17.5052. If the court finds the amount tendered in the settlement 
offer is the same as, substantially the same as, or more than the damages found by the trier of fact, the consumer's recovery will 
be limited to the lesser of the amount of damages tendered in the settlement offer or the amount of damages found by the trier of 
fact. See id. ยง 17.505(g). Section 17.5052 merely limits damages; it is not an affirmative defense to the suit and will not support 
the summary judgment."
1283,13," The Frost defendants contend Grizzle's response to the summary judgment motion did not address the ground that the loss in 
the trust assets' value was caused by market forces rather than Frost's conduct, and thereby Grizzle waived her complaint about 
summary judgment. See City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 679 (Tex. 1979) (holding a nonmovant 
who fails to expressly present, in writing, issues defeating summary judgment ""may not later assign them as error on appeal""). 
However, in her response, Grizzle specifically referred to ""market fluctuations"" that result in ""paper losses"" and contended TCB's 
decision to liquidate should have been guided by the best interest of the trust customers and that ""had the merger not taken 
place, these paper losses would have evaporated once the markets turned around (which they soon did)."" We conclude these 
statements preserve appellants' complaints on appeal regarding this ground. "
1284,14," TCB contends appellants never argued that TCB or Frost violated any regulation regarding the liquidation, and this failure to 
challenge this independent ground for summary judgment requires affirmance. See Williams v. Crum & Forster Commercial Ins., 
915 S.W.2d 39, 43 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1995) (holding appellate court affirms summary judgment as to claim when appellant does 
not properly challenge each of the independent grounds asserted for summary judgment as to that claim), rev'd on other 
grounds, 955 S.W.2d 267 (Tex. 1997) (per curiam). In the response to the summary judgment motions, Grizzle specifically 
attacked this ground. In their amended original brief, appellants acknowledge, in the statement of facts, that each bank liquidated 
all common trust funds of its predecessor bank after the swap because section 9.18(b)(12) of title 12 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations prohibited a bank, as a trustee, from holding investments that were part of another bank's proprietary common trust 
fund. Further, in the reply brief, appellants state that, while the banks ""proclaim that they were just doing what federal law 
required when they liquidated all assets invested in the common trust funds, this . . .view fails to recognize that the banks had 
the responsibility to mitigate any damages"" the transaction would cause the trust beneficiaries. We conclude these references 
are sufficient to avoid affirmance on this ground. "
1286,15," The Frost defendants contend Grizzle did not present any argument to the trial court regarding why they were not entitled to 
summary judgment on the claims for fraud and misrepresentation under the DTPA and, therefore, cannot argue otherwise for the 
first time on appeal. See Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at 678-79. However, we conclude that Grizzle's references in her 
response to the trust's losses from the liquidation without advance warning preserve appellants' complaint on appeal. "
1287,16," The Frost defendants contend summary judgment in favor of Frost should be affirmed because Grizzle did not challenge the 
summary judgment on this ground. See Williams, 915 S.W.2d at 43. However, Grizzle addressed this contention in her 
response. Further, in the amended original brief, appellants contend Grizzle suffered economic damages under the DTPA, as 
well as non-economic damages that support her breach of fiduciary duty claim against the Frost defendants. Therefore, we 
reject the Frost defendants' argument that summary judgment should be affirmed on all claims because appellants did not 
challenge summary judgment on this ground. "
1290,17," Grizzle argues that tortious interference with the contract of TCB was not addressed. Grizzle, however, did not have a contract 
with TCB at the time of New Galveston's alleged acts. Thus, New Galveston could not have interfered with a contract between 
Grizzle and TCB."
1290,18," We note this conclusion is in accord with the conclusions in H.S.M. Acquisitions, Inc. v. West, 917 S.W.2d 872, 882-83 (Tex. 
App.-Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied) (no tortious interference when parent and wholly owned subsidiary had a ""complete unity

they had a ""complete unity of interest""); and Schoellkopf, 778 S.W.2d at 902-03 (no tortious interference when company ""owned, 
controlled, and dominated"" by two individuals had a unity of interest with the individuals and were thus ""so closely aligned as to

167-68 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1997, writ denied) (parent corporation is legally capable of tortious interference with its wholly 
owned subsidiary's contractual relations because, as a separate entity whose financial interests are usually identical with the 
subsidiary's, parent's interference may be privileged under circumstances where ""the financial interests of neither motivate the

of the income from sales made by every distributor whom they have directly recruited, and by those distributors further

association with the Church of Satan. He stated that a large portion of the profits from the Procter & Gamble products go to

we had an Amvox that came down that talked about Procter & Gamble. A lot of you I understand did not get this Amvox, uh, 
but if you didn't get it, still pay attention to this because if this rumor ever comes up again you need to stamp it out. Uh, it 
was rumored that on a television show, on the Phil Donahue show, and it is rumored on other talk shows, that uh, the CEO 
or officers from Procter & Gamble Company went onto the show and told them that their symbol represents Satanism, the 
symbol on all their products, and also that they practice Satanism. I'm going to read you a statement here and see if we can 
get this rumor cleared up because I know a lot of you would like to know the truth and it is very important that you 
understand this. False rumors: Unfortunately this familiar trademark has been subjected to prosperous, excuse me, 
preposterous unfounded rumors since 1980-81. The rumors falsely allege that the trademark is a symbol of Satanism or 
devil worship. Typically the story reports a Procter & Gamble executive discussed Satanism on a national televised talk 
show. Another story maintains that the trademark is a result of Procter & Gamble being taken over by the Moonies, 
followers of Reverend Sun Yung Moon and his Unification Church. The rumors are, of course, totally false. Their trademark 
originated in 1851 as a symbol for their Star brand candle. Later it was designed to show a man in the moon looking over a 
field of 13 stars commemorating the original American colonies. It represents only Procter & Gamble. So if you hear any 
rumors saying anything to the effect that they are practicing Satanism and their symbols on their products, uh, are satanic, 
then it is absolutely 100% false. Uh, we don't want any bad rumors about any competitors or non-competitor, any company 
anywhere ever going out from us. So if anybody you hear talking about this in the organization anywhere at all brings this 
up, it is absolutely not true. Not only is not just substantiated, but is not true, period. Amway Corporation does not endorse 
spreading false and malicious rumors against Procter & Gamble or any other company. Please do your part as independent 
distributors by not spreading this rumor any farther or nipping it if you hear it from anybody else. We appreciate that a whole 
lot, uh, so let's crush that, if you're hearing any kind of stuff anywhere let's get rid of it and let's go on and build us a huge 
business and not have any of this kind of junk and that's a good lesson to be very, very, very, careful about putting anything 
down on Amvox that's not substantiated, and if anybody could take the blame on this, I can take it. So, uh, we just don't 
want anything to do with it and it was a mistake. It did go out to a few people . . . (drop out)."

the part of the district court in the dismissals of ADAC and Ja-Ri, P&G admits in its initial brief that, at the time the court below 
dismissed the remaining claims, ""the remaining defendants were Amway . . . Randy Haugen, Randy Walker, Dexter Yager, and 
Donald Wilson."" P&G does not contest the earlier dismissal of any defendants except ADAC and Ja-Ri. WOW International, Inc., Wilson 
Enterprises, Inc., Ronald Rummel, Kevin Shinn, Gene Shaw, Birdie Yager, and D&B Yager Enterprises are not even mentioned 
in P&G's initial brief other than on its cover. Thus, P&G either does not appeal their dismissals from the suit or has waived any 
argument against their dismissals.  Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir. 1994)."
1307,7," The only claim that remains on appeal from the Texas case that P&G did not assert in the Utah case is for violation of TEXAS 
BUSINESS & COMMERCE CODE ยง 16.29. P&G brought a number of other claims in its initial Texas complaint that it had not 
raised in the Utah suit, but it does not appeal the ruling as to those claims."
1307,8," Section 43(a) provides: Any person who, in or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, 
term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading 
description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which -- (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such

1308,9," The court ruled that P&G was a ""limited-purpose public figure"" with regard to the Satanism rumor and that thus the First

test applied to shield erroneous but non-malicious speech regarding an issue of public concern--in this case, P&G's alleged links 
to Satanism."
1308,10," Of course, the Texas district court retains its normal discretion in scheduling cases and granting stays pending other 
developments or the outcomes of similar trials. Should the court try this case to conclusion before the Utah court does, however, 
then the tables will be turned, and it will be left to the Utah court and the Tenth Circuit to determine the res judicata effect on the 
Utah case of the Texas court's decision."
1308,11," ""Actual malice"" is a term of art meaning that the speaker knew the statement was false when spoken or in fact entertained 
serious doubt about its truth.  Peter Scalamandre & Sons, Inc. v. Kaufman, 113 F.3d 556, 560 (5th Cir. 1997). Actual malice

1309,14, This is a question of first impression in this circuit. 
1310,15," The Third Circuit said: Most speech is protected by the First Amendment. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 503, 80 L. 
Ed. 2d 502, 104 S. Ct. 1949 (1984) (there are ""few classes of 'unprotected' speech""). ""Under the First Amendment there is 
no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience 
of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas."" Gertz [v. Robert Welch, Inc.], 418 U.S. [323,] 339-40 [(1974)] 
(footnote omitted), quoted in Jenkins v. KYW, 829 F.2d 403, 408 (3d Cir. 1987). Even false statements of fact are insulated 
from liability in some situations.  Hepps, 475 U.S. [767,] 778 [(1986]; Gertz, 418 U.S. at 340-41. As Judge Learned Hand

(1980), the Court explained why commercial speech may be more heavily regulated: Two features of commercial speech permit regulation of its content. First, commercial speakers have extensive knowledge 
of both the market and their products. Thus, they are well situated to evaluate the accuracy of their messages and the 
lawfulness of the underlying activity. In addition, commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest, is a hardy 
breed of expression that is not particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation."
1311,17," See Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52, 86 L. Ed. 1262, 62 S. Ct. 920 (1942); Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 95 L.

1311,19," Youngs Drug Products Company sent out two informational pamphlets. The first was called ""Condoms and Human Sexuality,"" 
which specifically referred to the advantages of a certain brand of condoms. The second informational pamphlet was called 
""Plain Talk about Venereal Disease."" It discussed venereal disease and condoms without ever referencing any specific 
condoms. The only reference to Youngs Drug's products was at the bottom of the last page, where Youngs Drug identified itself 
as the manufacturer of the Trojan-brand condoms. The Court noted that Youngs Drug described itself as ""the leader in the 
manufacture and sale of contraceptives."" The Court opined that simply because ""a product is referred to generically does not, 
however, remove it from the realm of commercial speech. For example, a company with sufficient control of the market for a 
product may be able to promote the product without reference to its own brand names."" Bolger, 463 U.S. at 67 n.13. Even 
though the Court concluded that the speech in Bolger was commercial, it nevertheless held that the federal statute was an 
unconstitutional restriction on the distribution of truthful information.  Id. at 74. "

tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing the speaker."")); see also Dun & Bradstreet, 472 U.S. at 748 n.5, 762 & n.8 
(discussing durability ""to show how many of the same concerns that argue in favor of reduced constitutional protection"" in 
commercial speech actions also apply to defamation actions concerning private speech)."

1312,24," A current example may help illustrate this point. It was recently reported that some movie studios have conducted advertising 
campaigns and focus groups on children under the age of seventeen to make some of their R-rated movies more attractive to 
them. Discussion of this issue may be of true concern to members of competing movie studios. Holding the accuracy of such 
discussion to a strict-liability standard likely would violate First Amendment values. "
1313,25," The Bolger test easily disposes of any question as to whether the fliers that were printed by Amway distributors and given to 
customers or potential customers were commercial speech--they plainly were. These fliers, associating P&G with Satanism and 
suggesting Amway products as alternatives to P&G products, (i) were advertisements--i.e., they proposed a commercial 
transaction, (ii) they referred to specific products, and (iii) the distributors plainly had an economic motive in distributing them. "
1314,26," We are not simply repackaging the ""actual malice"" requirement as a requirement of economic motivation. A finding of actual 
malice turns on the finding of false speech knowingly made, or of false speech made with a reckless disregard for the truth. The 
requirement of finding an economic motivation to label something commercial speech does not require a finding that the speech 
was false or that the speaker knew the speech was false before making it, but only a motive to profit by the speech. Once that 
motive is found, and if the other Bolger elements are present to provide strong support that the speech is commercial, the 
speech is dropped to the less-protected status of commercial speech, and a suit may be successful against the speaker 
regardless of his knowledge of falsity."
1314,27," Professor Farber has pointed out that the mere existence of some economic motivation cannot be enough to drop speech to 
the lower protected status of commercial speech: ""Economic motivation could not be made a disqualifying factor [from maximum 
protection] without enormous damage to the first amendment. Little purpose would be served by a first amendment which failed 
to protect newspapers, paid public speakers, political candidates with partially economic motives and professional authors."" 
Farber, Commercial Speech and First Amendment Theory, 74 NW. U. L. REV. 372, 382-383 (1979) (footnotes omitted)."
1314,28," We offer a specific example: A woman who owns a small religious book and music store tells customers that most rock and 
roll music is influenced by the devil and that the only kind of rock music they should buy is ""Christian rock,"" which is, of course, 
the only kind she sells. The determination of whether a Lanham Act suit could be brought will turn on her motivation. Evidence that she started the bookstore because of strongly-held religious beliefs that Christian books and music need to be 
made available to combat the evils of rock and roll and pulp fiction would be compelling evidence of a primarily religious, rather 
than economic, motivation for her speech. On the other hand, evidence showing that she is agnostic and opened the bookstore 
only after a case study in her MBA program showed that Christian bookstores can be extremely profit able when set up in the 
right locations would be strong evidence that her speech was economically motivated and thus commercial."
1314,29," As the Court said in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 344, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789, 94 S. Ct. 2997 (1974), ""it is often true 
that not all of the considerations which justify adoption of a given rule will obtain in each particular case decided under its 
authority."" "
1315,30, Labor cases come to mind as an example.
1315,31," We use the phrase ""analogous to employees"" purposely. We are merely making an analogy and are not ruling on whether 
Amway distributors are employees or independent contractors. We have not been asked to decide this question, nor do we have 
sufficient evidence to do so."
1315,32," See also New York Times, 376 U.S. 254, 271-72, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (stating that ""erroneous statement is 
inevitable in free debate, and . . . it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the 'breathing space' that they 
'need . . . to survive'"") (quoting N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 83 S. Ct. 328 (1963)). The inevitability 
of erroneous statements being made in free debate is not a new concept: "
1316,," To argue sophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements of the case, or misrepresent the opposite 
opinion . . . all this, even to the most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good faith, by persons who are 
not considered, and in many other respects may not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely 
possible, on adequate grounds, conscientiously to stamp the misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law 
presume to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct. J. Mill, ON LIBERTY, 47 (Oxford: Blackwell 1947)."
1316,33," The court cites two examples of the tension in Supreme Court caselaw. It compares Gertz, 418 U.S. at 340 (holding that 
application of the malice standard to public figure plaintiffs is predicated on the recognition that error is ""inevitable in free 
debate""), with Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564 (stating that ""there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of 
commercial messages that do not accurately inform. . . .""). "
1317,34," In U.S. Healthcare, the court addressed the same argument that Amway makes here--that the actual malice standard should 
apply to protect even false commercial speech if it is made about a limited-purpose public figure. The court did not consider the 
argument directly, because it concluded that the corporations that were the parties in that case were not public figures. 
Nevertheless, it stated that ""the [commercial] speech at issue does not receive heightened protection under the First 
Amendment. Because this speech is chill-resistant, the New York Times standard is not . . . 'necessary to give adequate 
""breathing space"" to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.'"" U.S. Healthcare, 898 F.2d at 939 (quoting Hustler 
Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 56, 99 L. Ed. 2d 41, 108 S. Ct. 876 (1988))."
1317,35," Cf. Bolger (holding that First Amendment protects contraceptive manufacturer's unsolicited mailing of informational and 
advertising pamphlets to households, because contraception information--even if distributed for commercial purpose--is a matter 
of public concern)."
1317,36," The Court noted that corporations enjoy the full panoply of First Amendment protections for their direct comments on public issues. There is no reason for 
providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made only in the context of commercial transactions. In 
that context, for example, the State retains the power to ""insure that the stream of commercial information flows cleanly as 
well as freely."" . . . As we stated in Ohralik, the failure to distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech ""could 
invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First] Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind 
of speech."" Id. (quoting Va. State Bd., 425 U.S. at 772, and Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 456, 56 L. Ed. 2d 444, 98 S. Ct.

1319,39," Langvardt's theory also would vary the standard by which a party must prove negligence, based on whether the speech is a 
matter of public or private concern. Allegations regarding the former should be proven by clear and convincing evidence, and the 
latter should be proven by a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Id. at 393-95."
1319,40," Langvardt points out that before its 1989 revision, no suit could be brought under the Lanham Act for false advertising about a 
competitor. The Act was amended effective November 16, 1989, by the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 
1051-1128 (1988). The pre-1989 Act allowed only suits against companies for a company's false advertising about its own 
products. The post-1989 Lanham Act--with its strict liability standard for false commercial speech--thus has a substantially 
greater potential to chill truthful commercial speech, according to Langvardt."
1319,41," Moreover, such a double standard could be subverted. Instead of saying that its product is the best, a company could state 
that all other products are inferior and by doing so move from a strict liability regime to one of negligence. "

1357,3," Plaintiffs reliance on Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964 (5th Cir. 1977) is, respectfully, inapposite. See 
Pls. DC Br. 26 n.11. In that case, a jury awarded damages to a manufacturer of automobile air conditioners for air conditioner 
models that it actually made and also for models that it did not make (having been unlawfully excluded from making those). The 
court held that this issue concerned the ""growth . . . of ongoing business"" rather than ""the expansion of a present business into a 
new [product] market,"" and that the plaintiff therefore was not required to show ""the preparedness and intent to expand in these 
areas."" Heatransfer, 553 F.2d at 986 n.20. By contrast, Plaintiffs' contention here that they would have sold tris amino, bronopol 
and AMP in this country clearly involves the ""expansion"" of their business into new product markets. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in 
Heatransfer, Plaintiffs must show ""preparedness and intent,"" which they cannot do. "
1360,4," Additionally, following further discovery in the Cook County action, Angus filed a second amended complaint (Reply Ex. JJ)

1360,6," Plaintiffs' supplemental citation of Da Silva v. Kinsho Int'l Corp., 229 F.3d 358 (2nd Cir. 2000), respectfully, is of no aid to 
Plaintiffs. As is pertinent here, that case merely recites general, generic principles regarding the analytical approach as to 
whether an issue affects subject matter jurisdiction or the merits. And, factually, Da Silva, is a Title VII not an antitrust case. "
1361,7," Plaintiffs' citation to Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612, 113 S. Ct. 2891 (1993) is misplaced. 
In explaining that the district court there ""undoubtedly had jurisdiction,"" the Court included a footnote describing the FTAIA and 
noted that ""the conduct alleged plainly meets [the FTAIA's] requirements."" Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 795-96 & n.23 (emphasis 
added). The Supreme Court's reference to the FTAIA in its explanation that subject matter jurisdiction was uncontested and 
firmly established only confirms that the FTAIA sets forth standards governing the jurisdiction of American courts over foreign 
antitrust actions. Like every other relevant authority, Hartford Fire demonstrates that the FTAIA is jurisdictional. On a different Hartford Fire issue raised by Plaintiffs: Plaintiffs also claim that, under Hartford Fire, they need only show a 
""substantial effect in the United States"" to pursue their antitrust claims, and not the ""direct, substantial and reasonably 
foreseeable effect"" required by the FTAIA. But as noted above, even arguendo if the Hartford standard is applied, for all the 
same reasons that the undisputed record shows no ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic 
commerce under the FTAIA, the record shows no ""substantial effect"" on domestic commerce under the test proposed."
1361,8," Relevantly, see also citation and quotation at Footnote 1 herein, p. 5, supra. "
1362,9," The legislative history that Plaintiffs cite is not inconsistent with all this case law. The legislative history does not describe the 
FTAIA as exempting from its coverage all claims involving goods shipped to the United States, but only claims involving ""import 
transactions (see Pls. DC Br. 36-37) -- i.e., the business of domestic firms importing goods into the United States. The only case that even remotely supports Plaintiffs' position is Eskofot A/S v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 872 F. Supp. 81 
(S.D.N.Y. 1995). However, more recent decisions have declined to follow its flawed analysis, which conflicts with the great 
weight of authority. See S. Megga, 1997 WL 86413, at *8 n.22. Plaintiffs' additional citations of Hartford Fire and Eurim-Pharm 
do not assist them. See Pls. DC Br. 37. Hartford Fire said nothing at all about the exception for import transactions. Eurim-
Pharm also did not address the issue and, in any event, the dicta quoted by Plaintiffs refers, like the legislative history, only to 
""import transactions,"" which limits the exception's scope to claims brought by domestic importers. See Eurim-Pharm, 593 F. 
Supp. at 1106. "
1363,10," The court reviewed and considered all of the points raised by the Plaintiffs, including some that were found impracticable and 
unnecessary to be addressed herein. The court is mindful, too, that Plaintiffs also addressed the subject motion to dismiss 
issues in Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment brief and reply. The court did review and consider all of Plaintiffs' 
arguments as to the subject motions to dismiss that were contained in the described partial summary judgment briefs of the 
Plaintiffs. Also, the court has reviewed Plaintiffs' sur-reply memorandum in opposition and finds nothing therein that would impact on the 
count's motion decision here."

1371,2," The Hospital Districts contend that the risk of duplicative recovery here is greatly reduced because, under the terms of the 
Master Settlement Agreement between certain states, including Washington, and the tobacco industry, any recovery by the 
Hospital Districts would be offset by a corresponding reduction in Washington's award under the Master Settlement Agreement. 
Assuming, arguendo, that this is accurate, it has no bearing on the possibility of duplicative recovery in the event that individual 
smokers who have been patients of the Hospital Districts bring suit against the Tobacco Firms. In fact, it was the possibility of 
claims by injured smokers, rather than state governments, that led us in Oregon Laborers to hold that the second AGC/Holmes 
factor weighed in favor of the tobacco defendants.  Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 966."
1371,3," The Hospital Districts also submit that they should have standing because, as political subdivisions of the state, they are 
possessed of certain attributes of sovereignty. Nevertheless, they do not, and in fact could not, insist that any such quasi-
sovereign status exempts them from the proximate cause requirement.  Allegheny Gen. Hosp. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 228 F.3d 
429, 436 (3d Cir. 2000) (public hospitals cannot invoke quasi governmental standing to sue tobacco companies on behalf of their 
nonpaying patients without regard to proximate cause). "
1372,4," The Hospital Districts cite several other cases which purportedly recognize a special standing rule for health care providers. 
However, these cases concern constitutional standing, not RICO or antitrust standing. See NOW v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 
255-56, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99, 114 S. Ct. 798 (1994); Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-18, 49 L. Ed. 2d 826, 96 S. Ct. 2868

Thus, they are inapposite."
1372,5," We note, finally, that while the Hospital Districts, unlike the union trusts, apparently cannot avail themselves of a contract-based 
subrogation right to bring suit against the Tobacco Firms, this is irrelevant to the question of whether their antitrust and RICO 
claims fail for remoteness. "

1373,8," Nor does Fisons Corp. require a different result. In Fisons Corp., the Supreme Court of Washington held that a physician could 
recover under the Washington Consumer Protection Act for damages he suffered resulting from a drug manufacturer's failure to 
warn him of the known dangers of a drug he prescribed to a patient. Fisons Corp., 858 P.2d at 1061. The physician in Fisons 
Corp. did not seek to recover for his expenses incurred in treating the patient who was harmed by the drug, but rather sought to 
recover for the injury to his reputation occasioned by the misprescription. Id. at 1061, 1063. Fisons Corp. thus provides no

engaged in predatory pricing tactics), therefore, antitrust actions for damages are to be allowed in all instances--such as here 
where the question is enmeshed really in balancing the policy objectives of two different statutory schemes, the antitrust act and "
1383,," the bidding statutes. That assumption is conclusory and avoids the policy problems and considerations raised by Brunoli; 
allowing a damage action under a different label would present the same problems as the Brunoli court was concerned within its 
opinion."
1383,2," The just cited cases talk in terms in whether a new law limits the operation of an older law. In fact, the state antitrust law was

N.W.2d 905 (1995), is that we owe no deference to federal antitrust law in this case because this is not an antitrust case. While 
this is true, we believe that the core idea from Carlson is that we apply the ordinary burden of proof when it advances the 
legislature's purpose in enacting a law. "
1413,4," In support, Flood cites to the comment that follows Wis JI-Civil 2780, which is entitled ""Intentional Interference With Contractual

1431,2," The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement is a horizontal market allocation agreement and is 
illegal per se under controlling federal case law because the Agreement allocated the entire United States market to HMRI and 
required HMRI to pay Andrx a portion of its illegally inflated profits. They also allege that the Agreement was an illegal price-
fixing agreement because its purpose and effect was to ensure that HMRI would continue to be able to market Cardizem CD 
free from generic competition and thus would be able to charge supra-competitive prices for Cardizem CD See Consolidated "
1432,," Amended Class Action Complaint (hereinafter ""Am. Complt."") at P 50. Plaintiffs further allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement 
brought HMRI protection not only from Andrx's generic version of Cardizem CD but also protection from generic competition 
from Biovail and Faulding (which had received tentative FDA approval for its product on or about October 26, 1998) because 
these generic competitors could not market their products until Andrx's 180-day exclusivity period ended. See id. at P 51.

1433,4, Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Schondelmeyer concludes that all or virtually all of direct purchasers fall within this category.
1433,5," Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Schondelmeyer opines that virtually every wholesaler or other purchaser or reseller of Cardizem CD would 
be expected by its pharmacy customers to stock a generic version of Cardizem. Therefore, he concludes, based on the large 
prescription volume for this drug, it is reasonable to infer that every pharmacy in the United States of any appreciable size would 
stock Cardizem CD as well as one of its generic equivalents when available. Similar economic reasons would lead non-
wholesaling direct purchasers to likewise purchase generics when available. Direct purchasers react to consumer demand for 
generics; they do not create it. Pharmacies choose a wholesaler in part based on the expectation that the wholesaler will have a 
broad line of drug products available, including generic versions of popular brand name drugs like Cardizem CD. Moreover, most 
third party insurance and managed care programs have policies that encourage or even require use of a generic when available. 
Therefore, he opines, to meet these third party requirements, pharmacies would need to purchase generic versions of a drug 
when available. Accordingly, virtually every wholesaler or other direct purchaser of Cardizem CD would be expected by its 
pharmacy customers to stock a generic version of Cardizem CD as soon as it was available. See Schondelmeyer 6/14/00

1441,9," This claim is also supported by Plaintiffs' proffered evidence showing that Andrx captured more than 50% of HMRI's market 
share for Cardizem CD within seven months of its entrance on the market. "
1442,10," The phenomenon is most prevalent during the first 180 days after Andrx's entry when other generic alternatives were 
precluded from entry. Plaintiffs present evidence supporting their claim that when second and third generic versions of the brand 
name drug enter the market, price competition is enhanced and generic market share increases. "
1446,11," This Court has previously determined that Plaintiffs have alleged facts showing that they suffered an antitrust injury as defined 
in Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489. See Order No. 12, Mem. Op. & Order Denying Defendants' Motions to Dismiss at 54-79. "
1450,12," Defendants miss this point when they argue Plaintiffs must prove all their generic purchases were direct as opposed to 
indirect. Plaintiffs alleged injury here is that they paid an artificially inflated price for their Cardizem CD purchases because 
Defendants' illegal Agreement removed competition from the market. Plaintiffs further their claim that they would have 
substituted a more competitively priced generic alternative for some of their Cardizem CD purchases in the but-for world by 
showing they purchased a more competitively priced generic alternative for Cardizem CD after generics entered the market."
1450,13," Plaintiffs assert there is no factual basis for Defendants' expert Dr. Blair's speculation that the existence of HMRI's patent suit 
against Andrx in 1998 would have changed any class member's purchasing decisions. They point to an article, co-authored by 
Defendants' expert Dr. Blair, concluding that most purchasers are not even aware of the fact that they have exposure in a patent 
case. See Blair & Cotter, An Economic Analysis of Seller and User Liability in Intellectual Property Law, 68 Univ. Cincinnati Law 
Review 1, 1-5 (Fall 1999). They also argue that Defendants' position is further refuted by the fact that Defendant Andrx has not 
shown any apparent effect on its generic sales although it faced another patent infringement suit after it came to market with its 
generic version of Cardizem CD. See Schondelmeyer 11/8/00 Rebuttal Report at PP 80-81. "

1452,15," Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Schondelmeyer opines that damages to the class can be calculated by determining the expected generic 
penetration rate (% of all units that would have been purchased as a generic product) for purchasers at a certain point in time, 
multiplied by the total units of the brand product that the purchasers actually purchased in that time period; yielding the number 
of generic units that would have been purchased. This figure would then be multiplied by the expected price differential between 
the generic and the brand to determine the dollar amount of damages. He expresses the formula as follows: Damages = 
(Generic unit penetration rate) x (brand units purchased) x (price differential). The same economic formula and methodology, he 
opines, can be used, or modified, in order to reliably establish any direct purchaser's individual damages. See Schondelmeyer

] Mere bald assertions that defendants' activities restrain interstate 
commerce generally, along with reference to statutory language, are not substitutes for concrete allegations from which a not 
insubstantial effect on interstate commerce can be inferred.""). Thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this action on that basis."
1466,11," Defendants' actions arguably might constitute a group boycott, which is a per se restraint on trade in some circumstances. See 
Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 800. ""Group boycotts . . . generally consist of agreements by two or more persons not to do 
business with other individuals."" Id. However, it is not clear whether causing delay in obtaining a professional license can be 
considered an agreement not to do business with other individuals. Even if this were true, however, the plaintiff has not suffered 
an antitrust injury. "
1474,1," Excluding Iraq, which the evidence shows was not a participant in such agreements."
1474,2," Dr. Verleger noted that his proposed range of $ 4-$ 6 per barrel in excess costs - the ""overcharge,"" in antitrust economics 
terms - was derived using conservative assumptions, resolving uncertainties in favor of finding a lesser rather than a greater, 
restraint on trade, notwithstanding what he found to be sound economic evidence that the impact on trade and commerce has 
been greater. His conclusions thus have all the more force for purposes of these findings of fact. "
1477,3," If and to the extent indirect purchasers have a cause of action for damages under the laws of any State, such claims are of 
course not precluded, see California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661 (1989), and the 
Court expresses no views on the viability of any such claims, nor would they be merged into any judgment of this Court. "
1484,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that: HN1[
] every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any 
contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal."

1486,2," As discussed above, Ezzo's changed or added to its theories of recovery under Section 1 of the Sherman Act prior to trial -- 
claiming the 50% rule was a per se violation of the Act. Matrix explicitly limited its motion for summary judgment to this new 
theory, and the district court explicitly limited its ruling to this new theory. The issues of selective enforcement and whether the 
policy was a pretext for price-fixing were allowed to go to trial and are not considered on the appeal of the partial summary 
judgment. "
1489,3," As stated above, the 50% rule is neutral with regard to volume because any retailer subject to the policy can sell whatever 
volume of products desired by adjusting the volume or price of sales or services furnished in the salon to achieve the balance of 
sales and services required by the rule."
1489,4," On appeal, Matrix also argues that Ezzo's per se violation theory of recovery is barred by the statute of limitations. Since the 
district court's summary judgment was proper and dispositive, this argument is not considered. "
1490,5," Of course, Matrix argues that Ezzo's testimony is self-serving and lacks the independence valued and perhaps relied upon by 
this court in its previous reversal. "
1498,1," The Complaint dated April 28, 2000 named Daniel Gordon as Plaintiff and others similarly situated as the ""Windows Operating 
Software Class."" An Amended Complaint was filed on January 23, 2001, naming Daniel  [*3] Gordon, Brandon Welter, David 
Ellingson and Kari Wallace as Plaintiffs. The Amended Complaint contains additional facts, as well as an additional class, the 
""Windows Application Software Class."" The motion now before the court concerns only certification of the first class, the 
""Windows Operating Software Class."" The court will consider the facts described in the Amended Complaint as applied to the 
Plaintiffs listed therein. "
1503,2," Defendant criticizes the yardsticks, citing their ""principal deficiency"" to be ""that none of them even attempts to deal with the 
enormous difficulties of showing how much (if any) of an initial claimed overcharge was passed on to the ultimate end users."" 
Defendant's Memorandum at 35. There is some ambiguity as to whether Dr. Leffler proposes to use the yardsticks to measure 
overcharge to the direct purchasers or to establish the amount of overcharge passed through the chain of distribution to the 
consumer. When describing the Comparable Market Yardstick in his original Affidavit, Dr. Leffler mentions both ""the price to end 
users,"" Leff. Aff. P 14, and ""Microsoft's operating system prices,"" id. at P 15. Then he refers to ""the overcharge by Microsoft,"" id. 
at P 17, and ""Microsoft overcharge,"" id. at P 19, when discussing the other two yardsticks. However, Lefler's Supplemental 
Affidavit contains the language quoted in the text, indicating that the yardsticks are intended to measure overcharge to direct 
purchasers. Relying on Dr. Leffler's language describing the yardsticks  [*26] as a measure of the overcharge to direct 
purchasers, the court addresses pass through as a separate issue discussed below. "
1506,3," Dr. Leffler is not totally clear whether  [*36] his proposed methodology will determine amount of individual damages or 
aggregate damages to the class. Dr. Leffler considers the issue of individual damages ""premature"" at this stage, but indicates 
nonetheless that his methodology will yield a ""specific individual's damages."" Leff. Supp. Aff. P 32 fn. 60. The damage 
calculations here, like those in Gilchrist v. Pearl, 387 N.W.2d 412 (Minn. 1986), involve determining the percentage of 
Defendant's alleged overcharge that has been passed through to consumers. All purchasers in specific distribution channels 
presumably experienced a similar percentage pass through, and the court proceeds with the understanding that the percentage 
of pass through, as determined by Dr. Leffler's proposed methodology, will be applicable to class members on an individual 
basis. "

1521,8," Because the statute of limitations for antitrust actions in Maine and Wisconsin is six years, Dentsply does not seek summary 
judgment on statute of limitations grounds for claims arising under those laws. The federal antitrust laws and the antitrust laws of 
all other states involved here provide a limitations period of four years or less. See discussion infra Section IV.D. "

1522,10," In that case, Roland Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380 (7th Cir. 1984), the court specifically held that, 
""although we have concluded that the district judge should not have granted Roland's motion for a preliminary injunction, our 
discussion of the probable merits of Roland's antitrust claim is tentative. We do not exclude the possibility that on the fuller 
record made in the trial on the merits Roland will succeed in establishing its claim."" Id. at 395-96. "

purchased such products through Dentsply Dealers . . . ."" (C.A. No. 99-255, D.I. 1, P 10)(emphasis added). In their opposition to 
Dentsply's motion for summary judgment on standing grounds, the Hess plaintiffs claimed that ""discovery has revealed that a 
substantial portion of Dentsply's sales are made directly to labs."" (C.A. No. 99-255, D.I. 151 at 44 n. 21) The Hess plaintiffs 
offered to amend the complaint to allege that some laboratories purchased teeth directly from Dentsply. (Id.)"
1526,13," The court is not convinced that the stipulations will have the purported effects of eliminating duplicative recovery or difficulty in 
apportionment. The stipulations are only between the named plaintiffs and the 22 individual Trubyte dealers. Even if this court

and there is a movement in the U.S. Congress to amend federal law to provide for indirect injury. Costs borne by a 
middleman as a result of anticompetitive activities are passed on to the consumer, even though the consumer does not buy 
directly from the violator. In the example cited above, a retailer forced to buy overpriced goods would protect himself or 
herself by raising retail prices to provide the normal markup and could, in addition, win damages from the manufacturer in 
an antitrust action. It is only the ultimate purchaser who loses. Providing entitlement to damages to parties indirectly injured 
would simply be just. . . . Prosecution of an antitrust action is a highly technical and complex matter, so there is little

1547,5," The conspiracy class period is defined as July 9, 1998 through such time that the effects of the Hoechst Defendants' and 
Andrx's agreement and conspiracy to delay competition have subsided. See Complt. at P 17. The monopoly class period is 
defined as commencing on the earlier of the date following the Hoechst Defendants' November 8, 1996 withdrawal of their letter 
of reference that Biovail could otherwise have begun commercially marketing a generic bioequivalent of Cardizem CD or 
September 15, 1997, the date the FDA preliminarily approved Andrx's generic bioequivalent of Cardizem CD and continuing 
through such time that the effects of defendants' anticompetitive conduct which delayed the entry of generic competition to 
Cardizem CD have been ameliorated through competition unaffected by the Hoechst Defendants' illegal and unfair business 
practices. Id. "
1548,6," Plaintiffs assert that Cardizem CD and its generic bioequivalents are in essence the same drug product because FDA-
approved generic versions of a brand name drug are fully substitutable for the brand. The only difference between the brand and 
the generic drug, Plaintiffs contend, is their price. The generic version is less expensive thus yielding measurable savings for 
end payers who are able to purchase generic alternatives to the brand name drug. "
1555,7," Plaintiffs insist that the price of Cardizem CD after generic entry is not the benchmark for competitive price levels. See Saha 
8/1/00 Rebuttal Report at 3. It is Plaintiffs' position that the but-for price of Cardizem CD is probative only of what the but-for

in the Gallatin market. See id. When Rosemon, an agent of Evansville Oil, procured orders from S.W. Love and other "
1615,," Standard Oil customers, Comer directed Holt to procure the countermand of the orders that had been given Evansville Oil. 
See id. In order to induce Love and others to countermand the Evansville Oil orders, Holt arranged to have one hundred 
gallons of oil delivered from the Standard Oil Gallatin storage tanks to customers who countermanded their orders. See id. "
1617,6," In rendering this decision, the Court acknowledges that at least one other federal district court has disagreed with the rationale 
underlying the interstate/intrastate distinction as articulated in Lynch, Blake, Dzik & Dzik, and Mylan. See In re Cardizem CD 
Antitrust Litigation, 105 F. Supp. 2d 618, 667 (E.D. Mich. 2000). However, this Court respectfully disagrees with Cardizem's 
predictions regarding the approach that the Tennessee Supreme Court might take with respect to the TTPA and TCPA, as well 
as with Cardizem's interpretation of Blake. "
1620,7," As yet another factor warranting dismissal, the court in Bonham states that ""HN13[
] before recovery can be had against the 
defendant on the theory of unjust enrichment, the provider of the benefit must have exhausted his remedies against the person 
with whom he had contracted."" 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 237, at *20. The record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that 
Plaintiff first pursued claims against the retailers or other persons from whom she directly purchased vitamin supplements. This 
is yet another factor that weighs against Plaintiff's recovery under the unjust enrichment theory. "
1621,8," Plaintiff directs the Court's attention to Prism Partners v. Figlio, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 777, No. 01 A01-9703-CV-00103 
(Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 1997), to support her suggestion that ""a conspiracy claim may survive dismissal even when the 
remaining causes of action have been dismissed."" Pl's. Opp. Mem. at 54 n.54. In Prism Partners, the court stated that dismissal 
of the underlying fraud claim did not automatically dispose of the conspiracy charge. The court made this determination based 
on the fact that the plaintiff had pleaded two separate torts, fraud and conspiracy. Therefore, this Court interprets Prism Partners 
to hold that the conspiracy charge could survive in that case based on one of the tort claims. However, to the extent that Prism 
Partners results in a holding that states, implicitly or otherwise, that conspiracy can be maintained as a separate cause of action, 
it is clearly contrary to existing precedent. "
1626,1," These non-defendant dairies include Tuscan Dairy Farms, Inc.; Bartlett Dairy, Inc. (""Bartlett""); Queensboro Farm Products, Inc.; 
Swede Farms, Inc.; Derle Dairy, Inc.; Empire City Dairy & Milk Products, Inc.; and Sweet Clover Farms, Inc. Compl., P8. "
1638,1," At oral argument, plaintiffs moved to dismiss their claims against Southland. The motion was granted, and those claims will not 
be addressed in this opinion. "
1643,2," A vertical restraint involves agreements to restrain trade between companies at different levels of distribution, e.g., 
manufacturers and distributors.  Carlson Mach. Tools, Inc. v. American Tool, Inc., 678 F.2d 1253, 1259 (5th Cir. 1982). This 
case involves an alleged vertical restraint because Pennzoil is a petroleum producer and Southland is a petroleum purchaser. "
1648,1," Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a memo in support of its motion to file an overlength brief (Dkt. No. 65) is GRANTED. Plaintiff's 
motion for leave to file an overlength brief (Dkt. No. 57) is GRANTED. "
1650,2," Metronet is exclusively a reseller of Centrex services, so it actually competes in only a subsection of the market for local 
business phone service. Nevertheless, it would be inappropriate to define the relevant market more narrowly for the purposes of 
Metronet's essential facilities claim because an essential facilities claim requires the plaintiff to prove that there is a relevant 
market in which the plaintiff and defendant compete. See, e.g., Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., 195 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 
1999)(""There must be a market in which plaintiff and defendant compete, such that a monopolist extends its monopoly to the 
downstream market by refusing access to the facility it controls""). Qwest does not compete in the reselling niche of the larger 
local business telephone service market. Therefore, limiting the relevant market to reselling would be inappropriate in the context 
of an essential facilities claim. "
1651,3," Qwest also argues that Metronet is not entitled to access to Centrex on terms that guarantee Metronet's profitability, and should 
not be permitted to proceed to trial simply by alleging that the terms on which they are granted access to Centrex make it 
unprofitable for them to pursue their reselling business. Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. CSX Transport., Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 545 
(4th Cir. 1991)(granting summary judgment on an essential facilities claim even though the rate charged for access made it 
unprofitable for the plaintiff; ""the reasonable standard of access factor can not [sic] be read to mean the assurance of a profit for 
[the plaintiff]""). This argument is unavailing for two reasons: First, no firm can be guaranteed a profit by the terms on which they 
are granted access to an essential facility because there are myriad potential causes of unprofitability for which the terms of 
access could not compensate. The force of the Fourth Circuit's statement for this case, then, is not that Qwest may price with 
impunity no matter what effect its pricing policy has on its competitors in the downstream market. Rather, the statement merely 
means, in this context, that Qwest cannot be expected to compensate with its pricing policy for other factors that may cause 
Metronet to be unprofitable. Second, Qwest is well-aware that the Ninth Circuit would find a denial of access where the 
defendant's terms of access to an essential facility would ""drive [defendant's] competitors away."" See Qwest's Memo in Support 
at 12. If the per location pricing policy by itself caused Metronet to be unprofitable, and Metronet can prove this, then Qwest 
might be driving Metronet away, and therefore denying access under Ninth Circuit interpretation of the denial of access prong of 
the essential facilities doctrine. "
1652,4," According to standard price theory, prices increase as output decreases and demand rises. See Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 
and Policy, ยง 1.1. Thus, monopolists in markets to which price theory applies can increase prices in the market by reducing "
1653,," output and driving up demand. Oil companies, for example, can increase demand, and hence price, by making less oil available. 
Phone service, however, is not a commodity susceptible to output limitation in the way that oil is. Thus, Qwest cannot control the 
prices for the service it provides in way that oil companies can control the prices for the product they provide. "
